    <title>Suggestion for site</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/suggestion-for-site/105394</link>
    <description>Idk if any one cares what i think, but has any one looked at the members list under post count? there are over a thousand pages of people registered, and only 185 pages of them have at least one post, the other 110000 or so people have no posts at all, i think there should be automatic trimming or some thing, if you don&#39;t make at least one post in the first week of being registered then your account is deleted maybe, that was ever one has plenty of time to make a post...

Ok... thats just my $.02 i have been meening to post here but i always forget lol, so does any one agree with me?</description>

Hmm, I think it’s more of, as George Carlin would put it, prick waving. He is showing off the size of his prick and waving it in other forums’ face by having 100k members, whether they are active or not it is still a big number <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

Let the wheels of capitalism roll. 100k+ members looks a lot more interesting than 10k in the eyes of an advertiser, doesn’t it?<br>
[/quote]After seeing how many users out of that 100k+ actually posts I don’t think so. “In the eyes of an advertiser”, the advertiser would be Mopar? He also publishes ads on his site, but it’s not his choice who’s ads get shown on it. Nor is it the choice of the advertiser who’s site their ad gets shown on (At least for google, I think).[/quote]</p>
<p>I also think all the spam the 10,000 members make covers up for more than the 100,000+ anyway.</p>
