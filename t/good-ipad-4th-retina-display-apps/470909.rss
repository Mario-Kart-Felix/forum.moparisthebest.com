    <title>Good iPad 4th Retina Display apps?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/good-ipad-4th-retina-display-apps/470909</link>
    <description>Just got an iPad which I&#39;ll be using mostly for school work, maybe some programming if possible, and of course I&#39;ll put some games on there. Does anyone have some good apps to suggest? I can suggest Notability for taking notes, very advanced and useful.</description>
