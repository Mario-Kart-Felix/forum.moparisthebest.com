    <description>I went to the clients cache with toms cache editor and edited out piety, smite, retribution, redemption, and chivalry. I set the images to a blank image. The client still loads the smite and such, but how do I remove that? I heard it&#39;s in class 9 or somewhere near. I already coded out the prayers from the source so that&#39;s not a problem. Anyone know how to erase those extra images? If you can also tell me, I would like to know how to move each prayer icon to make it 3*4 without the ones I deleted.
