    <title>Can someone please help me fix this with easyrsc</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone-please-help-me-fix-this-with-easyrsc/517845</link>
    <description>Hey guys i have a problem with easryrsc that i need fixing.. i have tried.
Please don&#39;t tell me i need to switch from using easyrsc as that is not what my post is for.

my post is to fix this problem with Easyrsc.

When you log into a client, Logout and then log back in... When you do log back in attack a monster with your fist and at the time you attack the monster click the x in the corner of the client to close it.... Open another client and try to log in until it allows you, When you are allowed to log in then you can use prayer and it will not drain... hits will not go up or down unless you fight something else... if you use potions they will not drain.. all stats are bugged.

If someone can tell me how to fix this or will work this out with me i will appreciate it alot.</description>

<p>Dont listen to these negative twats, thats all thats in the RSC Community anymore, Start a server, you dont have to be good at coding like all these Dick Blowin Retards around here that have nothing better to do but criticize people.</p>

It’s because people in combat are not being logged out, and you’re allowing them to log in twice.<br>
[/quote]<br>
you can do it without attacking anything just logging in and out and in fast… i thought attacking had something to do with it but it doesn’t.[/quote]The same fundamental problem is there… You’re not ensuring that the player is logged out before you let them log in.</p>
