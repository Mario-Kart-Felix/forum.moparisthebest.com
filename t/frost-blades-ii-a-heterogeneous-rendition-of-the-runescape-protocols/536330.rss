    <title>Frost Blades II - A heterogeneous rendition of the RuneScape Protocols</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/frost-blades-ii-a-heterogeneous-rendition-of-the-runescape-protocols/536330</link>
    <description>[CENTER][COLOR=#008000]Welcome to Frost Blades II, we are (as far as we know) the first RSPS with any sort of diversity in revision (not including loading revisions on the same cache) and this is our project thread.

The Aim
Give players an enjoyable experience in the RSPS World, wether they like Oldschool, a bit in the middle or the EOC. We have worlds which diverse in revision, and we have 5 worlds in total.

World 1 : 742
World 2 : 742 PVP
World 3 : 317
World 4 : 317 PVP
World 5 : 751 EoC

Information about the server
You must register to play.
All the worlds are handled by one login server.
The login server handles logins (obviously!), therefore you only need 1 account for all the worlds.
Your character can&#39;t be logged into any 2 worlds at the same time.
You can only login to any one world at one time per computer (So you can have 2 seperate accounts logged into 2 seperate worlds, but not 2 seperate accounts into one world).
The login server handles private messaging and friends chat, so if you have a friend who plays the old school server, you can message them from a new school server.
Your character levels and items are different from worlds 1-2-5 to worlds 3-4.
	This is because of the highscores, it&#39;s easier to earn experience on the newer worlds because of activities such as RuneSpan, so the competition for the top spot wouldn&#39;t be fair.
When you log into the EOC world you will have your items from Worlds 1 and 2 (742).
World 2 consists of a PVP sever; you will earn your items in the normal world and pk here.
World 2 is entirely pvp apart from lumbridge courtyard.

There will be one client, which updates automatically and runs all the games.

We have our own custom chat system which is integrated into the launcher so the players can interact (works similar to XAT).

<p>Already changed it, was thinking what all the fuss was about so tried to merge the first 2 posts (they had a lot of pictures), I genuinely had no clue there was no limit to the number of pictures you could post (there usually is if you look at IPB or VB RSPS Communities).</p>

              <p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:19, topic:536330”]Rules broken:</p>
<ol>
<li>No multiple accounts. This has always been a rule and it’s only recently that it hasn’t been enforced <span class="bbcode-i">in some cases</span> when people want to make new accounts to start fresh.</li>
<li>No creating accounts to post on your own threads.</li>
<li>No spamming (while the posts are legitimate posts there is no reason at all to have 5 or whatever posts in your account for one thread and it looks like spam)</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m not being picky, and he can do it just as easily as I can, so how is that being a dickhead? You can get the BBC code from another users post by using the quote button and removing the quote tags. I was going to delete all of the other posts either way, I’m just giving him time to get the BBC from them so he doesn’t have to rewrite it before I do. It’s actually considered <span class="bbcode-i">less</span> aggressive to let people make their own changes to fit the rules rather than doing it for them. He can easily do it in less than 2 minutes, as could I, but I chose to let him do it himself.[/quote]<br>
You know as well as I that the multiple account rule hasn’t been strongly enforced in a long time. Given I didn’t realise the other account was his, no IP check anymore :(. This is hardly spamming, instead of trying to fix posts that are causing no harm try fixing the anti spam addon to catch the daily movie spammers. It isn’t bothering anyone other than you, it doesn’t directly break any rules that are game ending catastrophes. I don’t see why you couldn’t have just let it be, I mean, it’s not causing harm to anything and it honestly doesn’t look that bad, it’s a bit unorganised but it doesn’t look that bad.</p>
<p>I’ve asked him to change it but it just seems like effort for no reason.</p>
<p>Edit, not sure if Taharok removed it or not, I think we discussed it in one of the staff meetings, the logs should be in the staff board.</p>

<li>No creating accounts to post on your own threads.</li>
<li>No spamming (while the posts are legitimate posts there is no reason at all to have 5 or whatever posts in your account for one thread and it looks like spam)</li>

<p>I’m not being picky, and he can do it just as easily as I can, so how is that being a dickhead? You can get the BBC code from another users post by using the quote button and removing the quote tags. I was going to delete all of the other posts either way, I’m just giving him time to get the BBC from them so he doesn’t have to rewrite it before I do. It’s actually considered <span class="bbcode-i">less</span> aggressive to let people make their own changes to fit the rules rather than doing it for them. He can easily do it in less than 2 minutes, as could I, but I chose to let him do it himself.</p>

              <p>Just gonna go ahead and give everyone a bit of insight into what’s happening, I joined this project a few days ago after an offer from Viper, due to there being 5 worlds he needs help running them and that’s where I stepped in. From what I gather we’ve both ran pretty large servers and got enough experience between us to ensure that the worlds are run without any hiccups, or as little as possible.</p>
<p>Due to my busy schedule and the progress that still needs to be made on the game the server will not be opening until the 1st of January 2014. Stay tuned for more updates, the prolonged release also allows myself and Viper time to devise some kind of strategy into making this work. I’m not sure if there’s ever been a server with this many worlds intertwined so it’s going to be trial any error to begin with so this extended period helps us there, too.</p>
<p>Once the site is fully functional again we’ll let you guys know and we can spark discussions on the forum towards what you guys like. Stay tuned.</p>
