thats like what the server stays on after “start server”<br>
i need commands and stuff like that to like add objects… not just npc with the ::npc command</p>

<p>Okay, you will want to get your own server and client.</p>
<p>There are a lot out there, choose wisely though, many of them have broken cache.  Also with this concept, many clients have removed the useless “cheating” commands, some still have the ::noclip command though.  The rest is all server sided.</p>
