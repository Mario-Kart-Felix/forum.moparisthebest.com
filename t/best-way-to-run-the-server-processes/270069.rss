    <title>Best way to run the server processes?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/best-way-to-run-the-server-processes/270069</link>
    <description>I&#39;&#39;m confused on what &quot;should&quot; be the be the best way to execute the processes in a rsps. 
I&#39;ve seen a few methods now, the Java util.timer is Yz&#39;s way, and was mine for a while, I also saw Grahm&#39;s Event Manager, which, in all else was nice.
Also there is the shitty 500ms abstract boolean process(), which, we all know we shouldn&#39;t use.

I want to try and experiment with some sort of method, but I&#39;m not sure what exactly to try and implement.

I&#39;m thinking of a timer with a clean and exit object escape, for example, attacking. We don&#39;t want to loop through attacking forever, so, just create an instance while we want to attack, and then destroy it.

Do you think this would be effective?</description>
