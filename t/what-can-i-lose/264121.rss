    <title>What can I lose</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-can-i-lose/264121</link>
    <description>So im 5&#39;4 and in 4-4.5 months I want an estimate of how many pounds/kilos I can lose at my local gym(ymca)

Around 3-4hrs per day for 4days of the week I&#39;m there. I usually bench press, lift weights, use the treadmil(not alot maybe 30minutes), other work out machines like arm curlers and ab crunchers, and play alot of a basketball.

I&#39;m like 150-160 or something and I&#39;m 13 if that matters.

Start off: 157lbs

End of week 1: 155.5lbs (Feb 27-March 5) (1.5lbs lost)

Very proud of my first week. [Running every 4/7 days doing 500-600 Cals on the true strider]


Workout consists of: Abcruncher[30-60lbs] 20minutes+/True strider 45-60 minutes/Arm curls 10-15mins[10-30lbs]/Swimming 1hour/weekly/Basketball 15minutes-3hours [Depending how long open gym is]

So basically I&#39;ll keep a log for encouragement and shit here.</description>

<p>You would definitely notice a difference in a month, OnlyOneRule. Not much to other people, but you will feel stronger.[/quote]<br>
DO WHAT THIS MAN SAYS.</p>
<p>God damnit there are so many things wrong with this thread I dunno where to start.<br>
[size=15pt]1. There are more than two muscles in your body.[/size]<br>
Stop doing god damn bench presses and curls, OP. Biceps are a tiny muscle group and don’t really need any direct attention when you’re a beginner. Add in exercises for <span class="bbcode-b">back, shoulders, and LEGS*</span>. Do your squats, you’ll gain muscle faster than with ANY OTHER EXERCISE, and as we all know, muscle builds fat.</p>
<p>[size=15pt]2. Don’t you have anything better to do than spend 3-4 hours in a gym?[/size]<br>
After about 90 minutes (results may vary), your body’s hormone responses change from anabolic (building muscle) to catabolic (breaking down muscle). Stressing the muscles is a good thing, but too much stress and the body <span class="bbcode-b">starts to worry</span> and begins breaking the muscle down in order to conserve energy. So, really, keep your workouts to around an hour.</p>
<p>[size=15pt]3. Less is more.[/size]<br>
Don’t do weight training more than four times a week. Ideally you need 48 hours of rest between working the same muscle group. Hypertrophy (the act of building muscle fibres) works by tearing muscle fibres when you exercise (this is why you feel sore afterwards) and then building them back up bigger while you’re resting (and eating, see point <span class="hashtag">#4</span>). If you don’t give them ample time to grow bigger, then you’ll be undoing all the work you did.</p>
<p>[size=15pt]4. Eat more to lose weight.[/size]<br>
OP, conventionally there are two ways to lose weight:</p>
<p>[ul][li]a) Eat hardly anything and do a fuckload of exercise,[/li]<br>
[li]and b) Eat the same as you were before and do a decent amount of exercise.[/li][/ul]<br>
Method a will work up to a point. Sure, you’ll lose weight fast as hell but it’ll be unhealthy. You’ll lose mostly muscle (since your body in times of prolonged calorie deficit is actually more likely to store fat), and since muscle burns calories your BMR (basal metabolic rate, the number of calories you burn by doing nothing) will go down, consequently you’ll have to eat <span class="bbcode-b">even less</span> and you’ll find it incredibly difficult to shift that last bit of flab. As a result, you’ll end up looking like a flabby muscle-less twig. I’ve been there.<br>
Method b on the other hand is a lot more palatable. Not only will you gain some muscle, the muscle you gained will help you burn more fat. You can lose fat at a much more healthy pace, and gain some strength at the same time, and you won’t end up looking like a polished turd.<br>
What I want you to take away from this, is that <span class="bbcode-b">weight doesn’t matter</span>, only fat matters.</p>

<p>Tbh, <span class="bbcode-i">weight</span> doesn’t matter. You can be dehydrated one day and be several pounds less than yesterday-- it means nothing! What matters is your body fat percentage. It’s a common misconception that working out to gain muscle will lower your weight. This is untrue. Muscle weighs more than fat. Your body weight is also made up of percentages that are either distributed to fat or to muscle. So if you burn fat, you gain muscle. You can loose 15 lbs. of fat and gain 17 lbs. of muscle.</p>
<p>If you <span class="bbcode-i">really</span> want to loose body fat, then watch what you eat. It’s healthy for a male around this forum’s age group to have around 15-20% body fat. It’s also regular for males around this forum’s demographic to consume around 2500-3000 calories per day. Just keep track how many calories you are eating, as well as how many you are burning. If you are burning more than you are consuming, you loose weight. Make sure you take saturated fats and processed sugars to a low, as they are worse for the body and take longer to digest. Unsaturated fats and natural sugars are quite healthy for you, so start eating a lot of fruits and vegetables. One more thing that might help you is 3500 calories is 1 pound of weight. Bear that in mind.</p>

You’re just injuring your muscles by working out for 4 hours at the gym. Stay for an hour and a half at the most.</p>
<p>You would definitely notice a difference in a month, OnlyOneRule. Not much to other people, but you will feel stronger.<br>

You wont. Dude I go to the gym 4 times a week, and have been doing so for nearly a year now. I have put on quite a bit of wieght. The main thing I see happen is people like you going to the gym and expecting a BIG transformation within a month. Then quiting because that is Impossible.</p>
<p>You people think you know what you’re on about. If I spent 4 hours in the gym, I would nearly have enough time to do every muscle in my body. If I was to do that 4 times a week, my muscles wouldn’t be able to grow back and I would only end up with long term injurys. Go learn about something before posting.[/quote]</p>
<p>Did you even read my post? I said it was bad to work out for 4 hours, and you tell me I don’t know anything. Then you quote someone else who says the exact same thing as me and you tell him he has some sense?</p>
<p>You shouldn’t work every group of muscle at once. You work certain muscles each time you go. Maybe arms and chest one night, legs another, etc. Working out for 4 hours is just stupid, you’re body won’t even be producing growth hormones. When did I say you could expect a “BIG transformation” in a month? I said you would feel stronger, but other people wouldn’t see the difference. I think you misread my post but I can’t even tell.</p>
<p>edit: By the way, I gained 10 pounds in my first month.</p>

In a month :O, Are you nuts? Maybe a little. It will take at least 3 months before you notice quite a difference. Not saying it will be big.[/quote]He’s spending alot of time at the gym. He would see an improvement fairly quick.</p>

iPod+Treadmill is easy steps. ~5 miles on the treadmill. Plus you can cut back, maybe 1500-3000 steps, for doing <span class="bbcode-s">srs musls</span> Stork exercises.</p>

So 5miles a day would lose me 3-10 Pounds? Man my legs will be burning but I’ll try it. Where can I get a cheap ass pedometer? Like at a super market? And walking on a treadmill is even boring’er then walking outside.</p>
<p>On a side note: More sweat inside + I don’t freeze to death! How long do you think it’d take me to do 10,000 steps on a treadmil?[/quote]</p>
<p>Walk outside/jog and you will be warm in no timee.</p>

              <p>hmm… My high school has a weight program that is the best in my state. We also have the strongest football team because of the such intense muscle building during off season. I’m 6’, weigh 220 lbs. I bench 200lbs, 180 on incline, 160 on clean, 300 on squat. I also ran a 5.6 40. (I’m on offensive lineman) Before school, we come at 6:30 A.M. (school starts at 9:00 A.M.) and work out. We have an out of season practice for an hour, then we lift weights and run for an hour (about 30 min of each) then have the last 30 min to shower and such. We were given a nutritional information packet, which i can upload if you give me a little bit.</p>

              <p>glad you are trying, not like most Americans :p. The easiest way to lose fat is to walk/jog. but studies have shown [well currently] few minutes of intense exercises is equivalent to the slow pace ones that lasts for hour or so. i suggest that do intense exercises for a few minutes and take a break and repeat. sure it will kill your body but its the best option if you want to cut out gym time. personally i had problems with my weight, the problem was that i didn’t have much weight for my age.<br>
first time i went to the gym i was embraced as hell, i was a frekin skinny kid trying to body build and looking at the animals at the gym made me feel like crap. but protein shakes helped me a lot <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>btw if u don’t want to be at the gym, buy yourself a trend mill…sure it is pretty expensive but its worth it.</p>

On a side note: More sweat inside + I don’t freeze to death! How long do you think it’d take me to do 10,000 steps on a treadmil?<br>

Your gym might even be giving away pedometers. Also, it took me ~1h30m to do 8,500 steps last time.[/quote]<br>
Well I checked a few sites, I wont eat much I guess. So I’m expecting to lose maybe 2-2.5lbs per week from just walking. Then other exercies will probably raise it to 3-4.5lbs. Well I’m off on an adventure to buy a pedometer, unless the tredmil tells you how many steps you’ve done. If not I’ll set it to 1hr &amp; 45mins (estimating 10,000) Any more tips?
