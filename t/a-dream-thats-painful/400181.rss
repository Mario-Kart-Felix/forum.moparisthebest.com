    <title>A dream.. thats painful?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-dream-thats-painful/400181</link>
    <description>I was just looking at the &quot;lucid dream&quot; post and I remembered my dream I had last night and I wanted to see who else has these kind of nightmare&#39;ish dreams.. In the dream im in I wake up in my bed but in a completely different house, I look at the time and it says 3:17 A.M and I hear upstairs a giant crash. I look in the bedrooms beside my bedroom and no-one is there.  So I decide to go upstairs and see if someone stepped over and broke something. As I&#39;m going up the stairs I see movement in the corner of the hallway, it was a man with a knife.  I remember feeling the fear during the dream, but when the man stabbed me I actually felt pain. Like, really, really bad pain. And I didn&#39;t wake up. I&#39;ve had experiences like this in other dreams too, its really weird because every one of those dreams starts with me waking up in my bed at some weird home, also the time always says 3:17 A.M..

Any explinations? Any experiences like this? Or do you guys just wake up right before?</description>

<p>The time man. It’s this community. The time’s 3:17. The client version man. 317. The guy with the knife symbolizes that this website’s killing you. Not good man, not good. And you posted about on the website that’s killing you? Paradox man. Dream says stay away, you post dream on the website? And I thought the rapture was bad…</p>

              <p>i rarely have dreams and when i do, i hardly remember them and when i do, they are very short… <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> i would like to experience dreams like everyone else… maybe it would help if i actually got a lot of sleep(i get like 5 hrs of sleep on week days during college)? but ive had dreams effected by things happening around me while i sleep or whatever. like my mom telling me to get up or something, she like pops up in my dream right then and is saying what she said or w/e. also like the falling out of bed irl, i will fall in a dream.</p>
<p>My math teacher in hs said he could control his dreams, like he will be driving off a cliff and be like um no, and turns the wheel and drives right back on the rode. i wish i could control my dreams, ik when im dreaming but i have no control over what happens, its like i view the dream in 3rd person sometimes. actual i have viewed myself in 3rd person irl(no joking) i was in 4th grade and was playing on the monkey bars, i was hanging from them with my legs. i slipped and as i was falling i wasnt in my body, i was watching from like 5 ft away as my body fell to the rocks. it was very weird, sorry to ask on someone elses thread but has that happened to anyone else b4?</p>

              <p><span class="mention">@Davidi</span>, same man, when I was little I had this double decker bed I shared with my brother, he slept on the lower bed, me on the top bed. Unlike most double deckers, that bed had not any protection for like making sure you don’t roll of the bed.</p>
<p>And because of that I’ve had many dreams where I felt for like 10 minutes, I was spinning around, I knew I was dreaming because while falling I was slightly waking up, and just before impact, I woke up on the floor, as I said, happend several times.</p>
<p>Also, I don’t remember feeling pain in dreams, but what I do remember is feeling taste, I eat a lot of food in dreams because I can actully feel the taste, I found this power out when I was little, about the same time as the falling dreams.</p>
<p>EDIT: My mom always sees dreams and she basicly sees the future, when relatives get hurt for example or die, when she sees something she calls up my family in Armenia, and like 4 days later they call back and say that the exact same person had this or that. And this can’t be coincidence because it has happend several time.</p>
<p>Also, in Armenia people say that whenever one is after money in dreams, something bad will happend the day they wake up.</p>

I have dreams like those too (not to the extent of someone stabbing me…). Mine are just when my legs like lock up and jolt and it hurts like hell. Usually does it when Im jumping off of something. That’s not as bad as yours, but maybe you should see someone (like psychiatric help) if your having dreams where people are stabbing you &lt;.&lt;<br>

The thing is, their just dreams. That’s how I look at it.  And about past experiences that can turn out to be repressed memories, well sure that could be the case, I was robbed in my old home when I was 5 but I never got stabbed or anything like that… Hell, just last night I had another dream that I was falling and I landed hard on pavement and I didn’t wake up.[/quote]I heard that when you hit the grown when your sleeping you actually die… It would seem like that cause I always wake up just before I hit the ground. Plus reading this at 3:00 in the morning is not such a good idea… I walked out into the hall way right after I read this and I saw my shadow and flipped out… Thanks man xD</p>

<p>I’ve sometimes had dreams where I felt pain. The one I remember the most is driving into a lake. I have never consciously experienced the feeling of drowning, but I hope it’s not the same as the subconscious. My family has told me on many occasions that I actually did drive into a lake in my grandma’s van when I was about 3 years old. However, I remember events that happened when I was 6 weeks old. Perhaps the trauma of the event caused it to become a repressed memory, that I experience sunconsciously.</p>

<p>ya, i personally love dreams like those, even painful ones AFTER they happen. idk but it just feels cool, and a fun story to tell later.</p>
<p>i have one that i have of me when i was little, learning to backflip on the trampoline and landing on my neck mid-flip and breaking my neck. i feel the pain for a while, go to the hospital and wake up eventually.</p>
