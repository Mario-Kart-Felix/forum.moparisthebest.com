    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescapes-server-game-engine/442833</link>
    <description>What does everyone know about it? I would like to compile some documentation about it.

Here are a few things I know:


[ul][li]Loops every 600 milliseconds (not sure if they still do this..)[/li]
[li]There is an &#39;instance system&#39; (ei: how cut scenes do not show other players, and other players cannot see you during a cut scene)[/li]
[li]Script support since 2001 for game content[/li][/ul]


Can anyone else pitch facts about it, and I&#39;ll add it to the list! Thanks!</description>

<p>I think they were still dishing out client releases for RSC during the RS2 beta. RSC did stop in the 2xx range, and RS2 did start in 194. Also, let’s be sure everyone is aware that we are talking client versions here. The servers update far more than the clients do and they don’t always change that number. It’s more appropriate to consider that number the client version (not to be confused with any sort of cache versioning, which I believe is nonquantitative, since they can and do release multiple cache versions per client version).</p>

Lol, why are we talking about memory leaks?

[/quote]<br>
because they think memory leaks are the end all be all problem within rsps. did you say companies are not capable of producing bad software that leads to memory leakage? see: firefox.</p>
<p>edit: how the fuck could one even have memory leakage with in the JVM (assuming there’s no bugs with in the JVM itself). I mean, I suppose not closing a stream could cause a symptom akin to this, but the JVM has a garbage collector…[/quote]</p>
<p>Leaks are possible in Java if your infrastructure is large enough and you don’t properly handle cleaning up old objects. It’s moreover a case of not dereferencing objects that are no longer needed, versus anything else.</p>

<p>Lol, why are we talking about memory leaks? Firstly, we have no idea what sort of language they are using serverside (they haven’t disclosed that as far as I remember, though it wouldn’t doubt me if it was Java). Secondly, what does a memory leak have to do with anything in your scope? These are game servers that run for months at a time. They even manage to push updates without completely shutting them down. If they had a memory leak, it would have been found and fixed very quickly, not left to cause potential problems in months ahead. I just dont even know how to reply to this topic lol.</p>

</aside>
<p>because they think memory leaks are the end all be all problem within rsps. did you say companies are not capable of producing bad software that leads to memory leakage? see: firefox.</p>
<p>edit: how the fuck could one even have memory leakage with in the JVM (assuming there’s no bugs with in the JVM itself). I mean, I suppose not closing a stream could cause a symptom akin to this, but the JVM has a garbage collector…</p>

<p>Jagex knows how to go above and beyond when it comes to handling objects. I doubt a leak has ever existed in their official servers. I wish I kept some of the original documentation on when they were making rs2. They had some unique tools to use.</p>

              <p>What does everyone know about it? I would like to compile some documentation about it.</p>
<p>Here are a few things I know:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Loops every 600 milliseconds (not sure if they still do this…)[/li]<br>
[li]There is an ‘instance system’ (ei: how cut scenes do not show other players, and other players cannot see you during a cut scene)[/li]<br>
[li]Script support since 2001 for game content[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Can anyone else pitch facts about it, and I’ll add it to the list! Thanks!</p>
