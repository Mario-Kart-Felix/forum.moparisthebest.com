    <title>What kind of external memory</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-kind-of-external-memory/255258</link>
    <description>

I&#39;ve got four hours inbetween some classes this quarter. I also need another way to transport some big files between home, girlfriends house, school computers, etc (3gb+).

I was thinking about either getting a really big flash drive (32gb?) or a small external HDD (50-80gb?).

Don&#39;t know which I should go for. Anyone have either? How reliable are they? And what&#39;s the price difference?

If I went with the HDD, can I map it as a Network Drive so all the computers on my network could read it? That would be a deal maker instantly.

Or is there something like an external network drive where I can have it connected into the network and all computers see it as Drive X or something?</description>

              <p>just get a 1tb external HDD, you will likely be able to use that for years without filling its taken me a year to accumulate 100gb of shit so depending on how quick you accumulate data it could be a worth while option, i think you can buy them for aboutr £40-50 depending on the location, a little bit more than some other devices but definately worth it</p>

<p>There is around 300GB free space on one of my machine’s harddrives. I can partition that off, give it a unique drive letter, and map that. That way it’ll be the same path on all my systems. Like M:\AWESOME\STUFF.EXE on all the computers.</p>
<p>For transporting, we have an 80 gig hard drive laying around and my dad said there’s adapters to make it an external drive? So I might go with all that.</p>

<p>Size is nice. I can get a cheap 16GB flash that’s why I said that. The 32 and 64 GB ones get more expensive, up to and over $100. I might go for one of those. But the video files I’m working with right now are kinda contained in size. The 18 second clip I’m working on now is 50mb originally. They I export each frame out and that’s almost 2gb. Then all the maps are around 200mb, and the final exported frames are almost 2gb as well. Then all combined and exported I can get it down to 50 maybe even lower. But these are all 1920x1080 images and videos. I normally don’t work at this resolution for the whole thing because my output is 720p. I just want more detail in this shot. So it might be smaller for the same clip later on. Or larger but still smaller if it’s a longer clip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That UNC part is pretty essential too (\computername\sharename). Can you explain more about how that works? I’ve never played with that much but I need to get into it more. I don’t need to map it at school. Only at home. And it’s only on about 3 computers. Preferably the same exact path from every computer. Can I do that with the computer it’s plugged into? Instead of using a E:\stuff\files.etc path could I use the same \MAINCOMPUTER\STUFF\FILES.ETC or whatever?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They all should run like that. I’ve got one program I don’t even install on each computer, just copy the folder to each one and make a shortcut.</p>

              <p>Latency is pretty much unimportant when you’re talking about transferring a large chunk of data, so the bottleneck will be the bandwidth of the slowest interface (ie the network, unless its 1000mb/s). The flash drive will likely be faster than the external hd anyway, but when you’re going over the network it dosent really matter. So… pretty much the only defining factors for what you want is disk space (do you need more than 16GB? For video I’d have thought so but meh)</p>
<p>@ <span class="hashtag">#2:</span> You will need to share it as a CIFS share on whatever computer its plugged into (the normal windows share shit in explorer) and then you don’t even need a drive letter to access it “via the same path” (\computername\sharename is good enough), but if you/your app really wants a drive letter you have to map this individually for each slave computer (tools-&gt;map network drive in explorer) You likely wont be able to map it in school, but then surely you’ll always have it plugged in locally at school anyway?</p>
<p>@ <span class="hashtag">#3:</span> Yep, thats fine as long as the apps run contained (dont need access to anything they shouldnt have, yknow like those ‘portable’ editions of everything you get… or just use well written apps)</p>

<p>How fast do you think the connection will be though?</p>
<p>That’s like from Computer &gt; Network &gt; USB.</p>
<p>Just looked up quick prices on Newegg. I can get a variety of 16GB flash drives for around 20 - 50 bucks.<br>
Lowest HDD was 60GB. Closer to 100 bucks though.</p>
<p>I might be leaning towards the flash drive now.</p>
<p>It’d be for multiple uses.</p>
<ol>
<li>Transporting large video files (1gb/minute uncompressed)</li>
<li>Network drive so every slave computer could access it with the same path</li>
<li>Here’s a question though. Would installing programs onto the flash drive or HDD work? Some computers at my school don’t have the programs I need, and I can’t install anything on them. I can run programs from a USB drive though. Could I install them onto a flash drive or EHDD and run them on any computer?</li>

              <p>I’ve got four hours inbetween some classes this quarter. I also need another way to transport some big files between home, girlfriends house, school computers, etc (3gb+).</p>
<p>I was thinking about either getting a really big flash drive (32gb?) or a small external HDD (50-80gb?).</p>
<p>Don’t know which I should go for. Anyone have either? How reliable are they? And what’s the price difference?</p>
<p>If I went with the HDD, can I map it as a Network Drive so all the computers on my network could read it? That would be a deal maker instantly.</p>
<p>Or is there something like an external network drive where I can have it connected into the network and all computers see it as Drive X or something?</p>
