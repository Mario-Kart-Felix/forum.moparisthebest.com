    <description>helping my sister out with her AP Chemistry homework and need a bit of guidance on a problem (been a few years since I took the course)

7. Consider the following reaction at equilibrium:
C (s) + H2O (g) &lt;-&gt; CO (g) + H2 (g)
Which of the following conditions will increase the partial pressure of CO?

A) Increasing the amount of carbon in the system
B) Decreasing the pressure in the reaction vessel
C) Decreasing the volume in the reaction vessel
D) Removing the H2O (g) from the system
E) Decreasing partial pressure of H2O (g)

i came to the answer A through application of la Chatelier&#39;s principle of the general shift of equilibrium; for a shift to the right (products), such as an increase of CO partial pressure, the change was an increase in concentration of the left (reactants), which rationally makes sense. am i right? 

i also think that some of the other answers make sense but i&#39;m not positive, such as decreasing volume (obviously would increase pressure)... HELP

edit:
I&#39;ve eliminated answers D and E as they would definitely shift equilibrium to the left. answer C was marked incorrect on my sister&#39;s paper so i know it can&#39;t be that. A and B are the only ones left... i think i remember something about solids being ignored and therefore A would be wrong as well leaving B, but i&#39;m not positive.</description>

              <p>You probably don’t even need this by now, but oh well.</p>
<p>First we have to look at how the partial pressure for a gas would increase. Pretending it’s ideal we have:<br>
P=nRT/V<br>
meaning that P and n are directly related by RT/V. So if we increase the number of moles of carbon monoxide, we also increase its partial pressure.</p>
<p>Solid’s have constant concentration based off of their density, so their concentration will never change. As a result they are not involved in the shifting of the equilibrium. As a result there is only one mole of equilibrium-shifting reactant per two moles of equilibrium-shifting products.</p>
<p>A) would have no effect on the system<br>
B) would favor the side with the greatest number of moles, the product side<br>
C) would favor the side with least number of moles, the reactant side<br>
D) would favor reactant side<br>
E) would favor reactant side</p>
<p>So the answer would be B</p>
<p>Let me explain this more clearly. The higher the pressure, the more the equilibrium shifts to the mole-light side, so the inverse must also be true. Imagine that a reaction always wants to go to the mole-heavy side, and that the equilibrium only begins to shift to the mole-light side once pressure increases. Although that is a completely contrived example, it does allow one to rationalize what happens.</p>
