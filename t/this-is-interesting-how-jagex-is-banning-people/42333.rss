    <description>This is interesting how Jagex is banning people

I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t think of this before, but here&#39;s something interesting.

I have 2 characters in rs, and I just tried playing with them today, I started autoing on one of them, and about an hour later I stopped. Also, my buddy list is empty and I have never traded anything from this account to my other account. I then deleted my UID, changed proxies, restarted modem, and cleared cache as I always do.

Went on my other character whom I&#39;ve never autoed on, and it was just another noob char, and I just walked around and had some fun talking to people. Then I logged out, and I forgot to do something, so I tried to log back in, and they said my account was shut off/banned, so I logged into my account in RuneScape site, and it said I was banned for macroing.

And I found out that they caught my character I autoed with, and then did a search in their database for a user with the EXACT same password, and when it matched, they banned the char I didn&#39;t macro on as well. That&#39;s the only reasonable explanation, right?

So as a note, do not use the same password. You&#39;re probably saying, Oh I already knew that, but many people don&#39;t. Maybe this should be noted in scar scripts/scar help, etc?</description>

              <p>The point is, Jagex uses an array of methods to detect you. And when they do detect you, sometimes they hold off on banning you. Maybe they don’t care. Maybe they’re using you to update their detection signatures. Maybe you’re being saved for a mass ban. You don’t know.</p>
<p>To counteract their detection, you have to take a similar array of things into consideration.<br>
It’s not like bypassing GameGuard or Punkbuster - past a certain level of caution (e.g., acknowledging the reflection thread), it’s your <span class="bbcode-i">methods</span> rather than your code that gives you away. As semaphore aptly put it: no silver bullets. No magic bypass. Just consistently good thinking - if you’ve included cautions against something that Jagex doesn’t do, but might, then you’re on the right track.</p>
<p>Based on my experience, they appear to NOT use host name, IP, UID, player names, or passwords to ban across accounts if an account is clean (or cleanish) other than sharing one or more of those things with a banned/black-marked account. Otherwise, members of one of my bot-testing series of characters would have all been banned years ago. I think roughly twenty of them survive, and some of them date from RSC. That said, there’s no reason to give them an extra way of potentially linking accounts. You could get away with fourty name## accounts back in Classic (&lt;3 shellbots) but in RS2 people are going to notice, quickly.</p>

              <p>Stop thinking inside the box. The password check is likely only one single piece of the ban-machine whole. Searching a database for matching password hashes in <em>yawn</em>ingly easy. Without cracking out my old trusty sql pocket reference, off the top of my head, I would start with this: (It may be Oracle specific, I <em>AM</em> an oracle fan after all…)</p>
<p><code>select a.user_nm, b.pass_hash
from dbo.players a, dbo.players_xref b
where a.user_id = b.user_id
group by pass_hash
having count(1) &gt; 5;</code></p>
<p>Since it’s highly likely they have indexes on user_id and pass_hash (both are basically integers), this statement would be quite fast; even on multi-million row tables.</p>
<p>What is more likely is they generate a lists of potential cheaters from a myriad of tools. Password matches, UID anomalies, people playing more than X hours a day, large unbalanced trades, characters that have only trained a single skill over X days/weeks/etc, players that have X skill with an unbalanced list of quests solved, mouse movement anomalies, action forcing anomalies, ‘report-abuse’ targets, et cetera ad infinitum.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, this list doesn’t represent only cheaters. It likely represents quite a few legitimate players. This list represents the first-pass. The first-passers are then subjected to a battery of more fine-grained checks. Do you really need an explanation for why you weren’t banned when so-and-so was banned? Is it that you ‘are so elite that you bypassed their system’? Or is it more likely that they simply just haven’t gotten around to nailing your ass to the wall yet?</p>
<p>Them there’s lotsa fish in that there net.</p>
<p>It takes time to go through all of them. Also, what’s their hurry? They are under no impetus to get it done “NOW”! Some people are unlucky and are at the top of the fine-grained battery list. They get banned soon after botting. Some are lulled into a false sense of security (or a false sense of talent). These are the people that succumb to the fallacy that somehow they are ‘doing something right’. After the automated system runs its litany of checks against your bot(s), it then packages a nice list of data for real people to look at. I’m quite certain that this is where most of the ‘judgement’ calls are made. If you aren’t banned and you have botted, thank one of these people who, for one reason or another, decided against pulling the trigger on you.</p>
<p>Remember, there is absolutely no way of knowing if you are undetectable. Not even the great me can know if my system is undetected. I can only go based on history. From a code standpoint, it isn’t overly difficult to write a system that isn’t overtly detectable.</p>
<p>The point is this, there is no silver-bullet to protect your characters from getting banned. Code-wise, you can do everything in your power to protect the bots from code detection, but if your script makes a character walk around in a circle for 15 hours straight then all that code was for naught…</p>

<p>Naw Taios, every time I switch characters, I always do the above: delete my UID, changed proxies, restart modem, and cleare cache.</p>
<p>So how else could they have done it? I mean who is going to have a password like this: bhd742jk0l</p>
<p>Maybe their auto ban program checks the database and if the password is truly unique (letters,numbers, and long) and only very few instances occur, then it bans automatically. I doubt they would do this if someone had a password like “truck” or “ledzeppelin” or something that actually made sense.</p>

<p>He changes Proxies and Cleared the Cache. So I don’t think thats possible :P[/quote]</p>
<p>Ron, did you login into both accounts before autoing on the first one?</p>
<p>Hmm, that sounds quite likely star :).</p>

<p>I don’t know why I didn’t think of this before, but here’s something interesting.</p>
<p>I have 2 characters in rs, and I just tried playing with them today, I started autoing on one of them, and about an hour later I stopped. Also, my buddy list is empty and I have never traded anything from this account to my other account. I then deleted my UID, changed proxies, restarted modem, and cleared cache as I always do.</p>
<p>Went on my other character whom I’ve never autoed on, and it was just another noob char, and I just walked around and had some fun talking to people. Then I logged out, and I forgot to do something, so I tried to log back in, and they said my account was shut off/banned, so I logged into my account in RuneScape site, and it said I was banned for macroing.</p>
<p>And I found out that they caught my character I autoed with, and then did a search in their database for a user with the EXACT same password, and when it matched, they banned the char I didn’t macro on as well. That’s the only reasonable explanation, right?</p>
<p>So as a note, do not use the same password. You’re probably saying, Oh I already knew that, but many people don’t. Maybe this should be noted in scar scripts/scar help, etc?</p>
