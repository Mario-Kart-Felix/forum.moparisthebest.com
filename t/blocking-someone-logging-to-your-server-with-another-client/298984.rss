    <title>Blocking someone Logging to your server, with another client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/blocking-someone-logging-to-your-server-with-another-client/298984</link>
    <description>This has came a big problem now, Many people use Another client, but not my friend&#39;s server&#39;s client,

is they a code in any chance? that is something to do with Matches UID?
So it restricts login, But if you use the client it Allows you to logon.</description>
