    <description>
Ok, atm i have a tos/tou in place before you can get the the forums/server...but also atm if anybody knows a link into the website without pressing the accept button they can skip past that and go right into the forums and server. i need a flawless way to make everybody who enters my site everyday pass through that tos/tou so that i will not get shutdown. atm you can look at my forums at this location.

Roidscape.darkbb.com

this is not advertising i am simply asking a question that needs to be seen to be explained.

ok when you get to the site press accept.
then when it gives you the redirection url copy that...
exit your browser and open a new one. paste that url in the url thing on the top of the browser.
it goes right to the page without going to the tos/tou so i need a way to make everyone go to the tos/tou no matter what.
 BTW...Noone would answer so i reposted...</description>

<p>All in all, you’ll find that most people are not supporting you, meaning you’re not getting any help.</p>
<p>I show you respect and you call me an annoying kid and tell me to GTFO your thread? Well i’m not going to GTFO, let’s see what you’ll do about it then, shall we?</p>

<p>I’m sorry, but you’re not going to have much success as a private server host with that kind of attitude. You need to search for solutions to your problems and try again and again until you make it; otherwise I suggest you move on to something less demanding.</p>
<p>If you scan through the site page, you will find more tutorials to help you. I think it would help you alot if you start with the basics then move up as you get better at them.</p>
