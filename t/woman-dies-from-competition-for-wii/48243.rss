&lt;blockquote&gt;Woman Killed In Wii-Related Competition

Woman Killed In Wii-Related Competition A twenty-eight year old Sacramento mother of three has died of water intoxication after taking part in a local radio competition to win a Wii console.

Jennifer Strange was found dead on Friday at her home after taking part in a contest named “Hold your wee for a Wii” at the studios of radio station KDND 107.9. The competition involved drinking large quantities of water, with the last person to go to the toilet winning a Wii console – currently out of stock in most of North America.

An Associated Press interview with another contestant, named James Ybarra, claimed that contestants were initially given eight ounce bottles of water to drink every fifteen minutes, with larger bottles being used once contestants began to drop out. According to Ybarra, “They told us if you don&#39;t feel like you can do this, don&#39;t put your health at risk.&quot; He described the victim as “a nice lady” and that “she was telling me about her family and her three kids and how she was doing it for her kids.&quot;

According to Wikipedia&#39;s definition of the condition, water intoxication (also known as hyperhydration or water poisoning) is a potentially fatal disturbance in brain function that results when the normal balance of electrolytes in the body is upset by a rapid intake of water. It is unclear how serious a danger to the contestant’s health KDND knew the competition to be at the time.

John Geary, vice president and marketing manager for Entercom Sacramento, the station&#39;s owner, claimed to the AP that station personnel were “stunned” when they heard of Strange&#39;s death. &quot;We are awaiting information that will help explain how this tragic event occurred,&quot; he said. The incident has already been widely reported by mass media outlets around the world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>Woman Killed In Wii-Related Competition A twenty-eight year old Sacramento mother of three has died of water intoxication after taking part in a local radio competition to win a Wii console.</p>
<p>Jennifer Strange was found dead on Friday at her home after taking part in a contest named “Hold your wee for a Wii” at the studios of radio station KDND 107.9. The competition involved drinking large quantities of water, with the last person to go to the toilet winning a Wii console – currently out of stock in most of North America.</p>
<p>An Associated Press interview with another contestant, named James Ybarra, claimed that contestants were initially given eight ounce bottles of water to drink every fifteen minutes, with larger bottles being used once contestants began to drop out. According to Ybarra, “They told us if you don’t feel like you can do this, don’t put your health at risk." He described the victim as “a nice lady” and that “she was telling me about her family and her three kids and how she was doing it for her kids."</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia’s definition of the condition, water intoxication (also known as hyperhydration or water poisoning) is a potentially fatal disturbance in brain function that results when the normal balance of electrolytes in the body is upset by a rapid intake of water. It is unclear how serious a danger to the contestant’s health KDND knew the competition to be at the time.</p>
<p>John Geary, vice president and marketing manager for Entercom Sacramento, the station’s owner, claimed to the AP that station personnel were “stunned” when they heard of Strange’s death. “We are awaiting information that will help explain how this tragic event occurred,” he said. The incident has already been widely reported by mass media outlets around the world.</p>

              <p>Updated: 10:24 p.m. ET Jan. 13, 2007</p>
<p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. - A woman who competed in a radio station’s contest to see how much water she could drink without going to the bathroom died of water intoxication, the coroner’s office said Saturday.</p>
<p>Jennifer Strange, 28, was found dead Friday in her suburban Rancho Cordova home hours after taking part in the “Hold Your Wee for a Wii” contest in which KDND 107.9 promised a Nintendo Wii video game system for the winner.</p>
<p>“She said to one of our supervisors that she was on her way home and her head was hurting her real bad,” said Laura Rios, one of Strange’s co-workers at Radiological Associates of Sacramento. “She was crying and that was the last that anyone had heard from her.”</p>
<p>It was not immediately know how much water Strange consumed.</p>
<p>A preliminary investigation found evidence “consistent with a water intoxication death,” said assistant Coroner Ed Smith.</p>
<p>John Geary, vice president and marketing manager for Entercom Sacramento, the station’s owner, said station personnel were stunned when they heard of Strange’s death.</p>
<p>“We are awaiting information that will help explain how this tragic event occurred,” he said.</p>
<p>Initially, contestants were handed eight-ounce bottles of water to drink every 15 minutes.</p>
<p>“They were small little half-pint bottles, so we thought it was going to be easy,” said fellow contestant James Ybarra of Woodland. “They told us if you don’t feel like you can do this, don’t put your health at risk.”</p>
<p>Ybarra said he quit after drinking five bottles. “My bladder couldn’t handle it anymore,” he added.</p>
<p>After he quit, he said, the remaining contestants, including Strange, were given even bigger bottles to drink.</p>
<p>“I was talking to her and she was a nice lady,” Ybarra said. “She was telling me about her family and her three kids and how she was doing it for kids.”<br>

Woman Killed In Wii-Related Competition</p>
<p>Woman Killed In Wii-Related Competition A twenty-eight year old Sacramento mother of three has died of water intoxication after taking part in a local radio competition to win a Wii console.</p>
<p>Jennifer Strange was found dead on Friday at her home after taking part in a contest named “Hold your wee for a Wii” at the studios of radio station KDND 107.9. The competition involved drinking large quantities of water, with the last person to go to the toilet winning a Wii console – currently out of stock in most of North America.</p>

He described the victim as “a nice lady” and that “she was telling me about her family and her three kids and how she was doing it for her kids."</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia’s definition of the condition, water intoxication (also known as hyperhydration or water poisoning) is a potentially fatal disturbance in brain function that results when the normal balance of electrolytes in the body is upset by a rapid intake of water. It is unclear how serious a danger to the contestant’s health KDND knew the competition to be at the time.</p>
<p>John Geary, vice president and marketing manager for Entercom Sacramento, the station’s owner, claimed to the AP that station personnel were “stunned” when they heard of Strange’s death. “We are awaiting information that will help explain how this tragic event occurred,” he said. The incident has already been widely reported by mass media outlets around the world.<br>
