    <title>Why are these boards in this section?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-are-these-boards-in-this-section/277231</link>
    <description>This is a serious question here. I wanted to know why these boards go in the &quot;RuneScape 2 Server Emulation&quot; section when we&#39;re not aloud to talk about RSPS...

Explain please?</description>

<p>They don’t belong here but i really don’t think we need another section for just these 2 boards. Unless you made questions into an actual board. Then maybe that would work and look alright.</p>
