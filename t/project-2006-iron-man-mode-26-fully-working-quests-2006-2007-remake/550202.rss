[B][SIZE=5]URL: [url=http://project2006.com]Project 2006[/url] - ONLINE Since September 2014[/SIZE][/B]

[U][B]What items are there in iron man mode?[/B][/U]
[B][I]All 2006 items have been added, clues are working - and the best reward you could get is 3rd-Age, Dragon fire shield is added to certain drops such as King Black Dragon, Skeletal Wyverns, Black Dragons. - Trident of the sea is still in progress and will be added very soon!
[U][B]What is the Exp Rate on Iron man mode?[/B][/U]
[I][B]The experience rate for Project 2006 is 15x the Runescape&#39;s Original rate.[/B][/I]

[U][B]What is Iron Man Mode?[/B][/CENTER]
[B][I]Iron man mode is the second mode in Project 2006, it is known to be hard as there are certain restrictions - such as the restrictions of trading one another, some shops won&#39;t work for you as it is iron man mode. 

[b]Ironman rules/limitations[/b]

- No trading other players
- No picking up drops from other players (including PvP drops)
- No PvP XP (spell casting experience, splashing, is still gained)
- Nightmare zone is still in progress, however when completed players can only use solo nightmare zone and the shop will not sell you resources.

[b]Ironman Highscores[/b]
There are two different highscores, one for the main world, and the other for iron man mode.
This will be a great way to see who the best of the best are. If you no longer wish to go on as an ironman and convert to a standard account, your efforts as an ironman will not be lost.

[b]Skillcapes[/b]

Skillcapes are a great way to show off your self to other players in game, once a player reaches a 99 they will have the ability to purchase a skillcape from Wise Old man in draynor village.

[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/bixry8K.png[/img][/center]

[b]Dragonfire Shield[/b]

Even though this is a 2006 remake, to make dragons more motivating to kill, we decided to add in dragonfire shield - this shield will require the draconic visage just like normal RuneScape to combine to an anti-fire shield and it will also require 90 smithing or above.

[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/8gbDJSq.png[/img][/center]

[b]Fighter Torso[/b]

[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/f8l33iv.png[/img][/center]

Fighter torso is added to the game, this was released on the 4th January 2007 in RuneScape, but it is a really good item for the iron man&#39;s to enjoy.

[b] Ava&#39;s Accumulator [/b]

Ava&#39;s accumulator is fully working, and restores your arrows when they get hit, this is really good for iron men.

[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/uhVvXoR.png[/img][/center]

[b]Quests[/b]

- Black Knight&#39;s Fort

[b]Clues[/b]

Clues have been added to certain NPC&#39;s, and are pretty awarding, you can get anything from coins to 3rd Age!

[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/tJqdVEl.png[/img][/center]

[b]Drops[/b]

The drop system is pretty similar to the oldschool system.


[b]Donating Perks[/b]
We have only added benefits, which will not ruin the play to win feel, this is in no case a &quot;pay&quot; to win.
- sleight of hand $5- get caught 20% less
- master chef $5- burn fish 20% less
- master farmer $5- 20% chance of crop not getting diseased or dieing
- rings of life $15- all rings that have charges are now unlimited.
- runecraft madness $5- runecrafting pouches don&#39;t degrade
- bird man $5- 30% better chance at getting a birds nest
- miner miner $5 chance at receiving double ores

Project 2006 has always and will always be a community based game, therefore we want your opinions on what the iron man mode is going to be like, we hope to see you soon in game!

              <p>Should add your forum link to the links section of the thread. And interesting little donator benefits, I don’t think it should be based on each little thing though. You should make it for all subscribers but either or, it’s not a big deal. It’s a lot better of features for a donation option than other communities I’ve seen, and it works well for this base of a server.</p>
<p>Either or, I’m not interested because of other communities I’ve seen that’s been doing this a lot longer but I do wish for the best of luck. It does look promising, I will admit that much but I’m not interested in grinding something else other than OSRS itself.</p>
