[/quote]<br>
What? One tonne of thorium produces energy equivalent to two hundred tonnes of uranium.[/quote]</p>
<p>If you’re referring to the quote “current thorium reactors give out far less than what is put in”, then the keyword was current, as in right now what we have with the handful of thorium reactors, but after an hour of very stale reading on nuclear physics, nuclear technology and current thorium reactors followed up by 20 minutes of very sensationalist reading for thorium I came to the conclusion that trying to find proof of that statistic was boring as shit, so from here on out I will be disregarding it.</p>
<p>Now I’m for thorium, I’m for the research and development for better clean energy than fossil and current nuclear, but research costs money, building reactors costs money, infrastructure costs money, storing the abundance of electricity also cost money(and currently is very impractical), phasing out current power plants etc will cost money and make hundreds of thousands of people redundant. Thorium isn’t an end all for fuel problems, but you do want to know what is? Renewable energy, I.E., solar wind and hydro, yep, once we get electric cars and decent battery technology with millions of electric cars around the globe in charging stations we will finally be able to store the abundance of electricity from solar, wind and hydro electricity ending the worlds power problems for ever. A vision for the future world where energy free, clean and infinite, the problem? It costs lots of money, lots and LOTS of money, it takes time to research, years have been spent researching the problem and we will be researching for years to come, it takes time to develop and build the required plants, cars and stations, storing excess energy to charge the cars is another problem. Oh, and as I mentioned before nuclear fusion technology is currently being researched, another safe, abundant power resource. We use coal and current nuclear power because we already have them, in the future we can look forward to renewable energy on a grand scale, clean safe thorium reactors, nuclear fission etc.</p>
<p>I’m not joking, I’ve seen a documentary for electric cars but with renewable energy, nuclear fusion looks cool and so does thorium, all are practical and have been proven to work, and all have their share of sensationalist reading on the web and in documentaries.</p>
<p>tl;dr shit costs money, maybe more than some people like to admit($250 million for a thorium reactor? 20-30 years down the line when we have built hundreds and thousands sure)</p>

              <p>Get excited guys. The Chinese are starting to research thorium, with the goal being to completely ditch fossil fuels and other uranium nuclear energy in favour of it.</p>
<p>According to wikipedia, which provides a drastically simplified overview of what a scientist friend told me the other day, 1 tonne of thorium produces the same amount of energy that 200 tonnes of uranium or 3500000 tonnes of coal produces.<br>
The reactors don’t melt down, the waste has a much shorter half-life, and the thorium itself is completely pure from the moment it is extracted from the ground.</p>
<p>And it’s literally everywhere. If you’ve ever held a rock in your hand then you’ve encountered thorium.</p>
<p>Why am I making such a big deal of this? Firstly, the energy is dirt cheap. Secondly, the only other thing that really holds electric cars back is the issue with battery life.<br>
If the Chinese succeed and move to thorium reactors then their energy becomes dirt cheap, and the rest of the world will be happy to follow.<br>
With advancements in battery technology, the electric cars should become more and more feasible as time passes.</p>

how do people live without transportation and food? without gassoline we’ll have to rely on other sources of fuel (like corn) which in turn destroys the food industry. We’d need over 70x the ammount of pesticides and nuclear reactors to be able to power the corn industry and alternative fuel industry alone due to the fact that we wouldn’t have enough power to stabalize it in the firstplace (since many want oil shut down instantly). Therefore we need oil, and if we’d just go into America’s farmlands alone to drill, we’d have enough oil to last the entire world 2 centuries. I think that’s enough time to stabalize another type of fuel don’t you? Also i highly doubt the media isn’t being biased on this at all, especially since many brands of media (even fox) are being paid millions by political based corperations (who practically own almost all kinds of news on the current media bandwagon).

<p>But what pisses me off I live in Canada with the second largest oil reserves. We export it to the USA and they can still afford to sell it 2x cheaper then they do here. I’m only hours away from the USA border, and if they can sell it for half the cost there, there’s no reason they can’t sell it for that price here.</p>
