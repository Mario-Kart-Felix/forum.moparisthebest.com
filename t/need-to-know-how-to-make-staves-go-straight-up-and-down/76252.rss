    <title>Need to know how to make staves go straight up and down</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-to-know-how-to-make-staves-go-straight-up-and-down/76252</link>
    <description>My server is currently using &quot;fr33sc4p3 pkz&quot; source, and in it, there is an iban staff code (1409), and i spawned it, and when you wield it, it goes straight up and down, like a walking stick sort&#39;ve. I need a tut to make all staves go like that. So can somebody please post one here, and where to insert it?</description>
