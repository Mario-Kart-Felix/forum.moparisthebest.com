    <title>Stop NPC spawning?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stop-npc-spawning/280322</link>
    <description>I have a minigame designed to cover the entire world, but the NPC sort of get in the way..
I need to find a way to make NPCs not generate under certain conditions(true value) upon server start up.

I have tried this:
[code]	public LoadNPCLists() {
		if(!randomBoolean) {
			loadNPCs();
		}
		loadNPCList();
	}[/code]

That seems to work but for some reason it messes up player movement, when they walk they run when they run they are ... the black guy in the olympics.
Does anyone have an idea without messing up basic player functions?</description>

              <p>It doesn’t have to do with LoadNPCLists() because I have already tried it numerous ways with this tidbit with the same result.</p>
<p>For some reason ints throw nullpointers O.o…</p>
<p>randomBoolean is set to true in it’s own class,  I never bothered in the demo code lines to add in the import :\</p>

              <p>Umm I know this may sound a little stupid but try using integer instead of boolean, just a suggestion, also , have you tested this on other sources?</p>
<p>I think because LoadNPCLists() is being called as soon as the server starts up, it could be a problem because the randomboolean hasnt been set to true or false?</p>
