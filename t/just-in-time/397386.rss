    <title>Just In Time?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/just-in-time/397386</link>
    <description>Recently, I&#39;ve heard some talk about the Just In Time compiler (or compilation rather). Supposedly it performs bytecode optimization that re-orders the oder of execution by the virtual machine and keeps a cache of machine code of commonly called code. If I&#39;ve misunderstood this, please correct me.

Any who, it was claimed in the conversation that the use of said compilation method creates similar benchmarks in Java applications comparable to C; obviously, just hearing about this subject I am not very familiar with the technicalities/efficiency and I am pretty skeptical. I am asking if this is true/some-what true (it&#39;s obviously that something of this nature would aid speeding up bytecode execution, but to what extent)?</description>

<p>That’s pretty impressive; especially since Java has been notoriously known as a <span class="bbcode-i">slower</span> language.</p>
