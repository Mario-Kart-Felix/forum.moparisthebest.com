<p>Well sorry, I’m not really an advert type . But I’ve listed <em>some</em> of the features. That’s really what I need to do right? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<ul>
<li>Server’s Got a good host, so you’ll be playing 24/7 . There maybe some downtime, cause we don’t have VPS, but it should be 24/7</li>
