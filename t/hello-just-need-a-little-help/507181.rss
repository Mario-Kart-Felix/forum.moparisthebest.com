    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hello-just-need-a-little-help/507181</link>
    <description>Hello, i am trying to set up my first rsps and im have a problem that is probably really stupid but i hope i can get some help..
So I downloaded TrisidiaX V3 Final Release and i port forwarded i checked it and im running DUC and i think i got everything i need for it. i changed the compile.bat to my version of java and i did this for environmental variables..
but when i try to run the server it says &quot;Error: could not find or load main class Dexter&quot; but when i checked it is in the folder so idk what to do..

im not closed minded on dling another server if you think this is just a bad server i just want a oldish rsps like 317 economy based for me and my friends to play on

Skype name: CraftableDan

thanks for the help :)</description>
