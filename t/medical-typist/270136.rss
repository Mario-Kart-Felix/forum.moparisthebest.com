    <title>Medical Typist</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/medical-typist/270136</link>
    <description>So i have been trying to find a typing sort of job, none are within distance to travel to, except medical typists.

My mother is a high ranked nurse at a huge hospital not far from me, transport is easy and im almost certain they would need some sort of &#39;medical typists&#39;

Would this be hard, my question is? im a fast typer, but having to type medical words could become a problem (as i have never used a medical word in my life, i can only imagine all those long confusing words)</description>
