    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/d-link-dir-655-wont-save-changes-and-wont-upgrade-firmware/441357</link>
    <description>Hey guys, i used to portforward by my mom, but now i moved in by my dad and he has a D-link DIR 655 router, and everytime i try to open up a few ports and save it, it says its loading and i&#39;ve to wait, and when that screen is over i have to login again.
And when i login and go back the the portforward section its just back to the default.

so i tried to upgrade my firmware from 2.1 to 3.5, but when i do that it says its updated but it still is 2.1

anyone knows how to solve this??  its a A4 2.1 firmware.</description>
