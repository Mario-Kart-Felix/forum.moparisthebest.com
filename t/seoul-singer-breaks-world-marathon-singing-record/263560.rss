    <title>Seoul singer breaks world marathon singing record</title>

    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;SEOUL (AFP) – A South Korean housewife on Saturday broke a world record in marathon singing after crooning for more than 76 hours without stopping at a Seoul karaoke bar, local record verifiers said.

Kim Sun-Ok, 54, broke the 75-hour Guinness World Record held by Marcus Lapratt of the United States, the private Korea Record Institute said.

She started singing at 11:14 am Thursday (0214 GMT) and sang a total of 1,283 tunes before she gave up at 3:21 pm Saturday following her family&#39;s appeal for her to quit for the sake of her health, it said.

Under Guinness World Record regulations, she was given 30-second breaks between songs and five-minute breaks every hour. She was also barred from singing any song she had already sung less than four hours earlier, it said.

&quot;My sister has had a very strong sense of determination since she was young. Once she sets her mind to anything, she finishes it,&quot; her brother, Kwang-Jin, was quoted as telling South Korea&#39;s Yonhap news agency.

The Korea Record Institute said it would submit video footage of Kim&#39;s feat to the Guinness authorities for official recognition as the new title holder in &quot;longest singing marathon by an individual.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Even with short breaks, that had to be killing her* health. =P</description>

<p>That’s pretty awesome, though. I’d get bored in the first hour or two.</p>
