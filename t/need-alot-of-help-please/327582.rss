    <title>Need alot of help please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-alot-of-help-please/327582</link>
    <description>I am wondering if anyone can tell me how to a few things.
1. Fix my fight pits, players can&#39;t attack each other in there.
2. Change the amount of xp a skill gives, like woodcutting.
3. How to fix my clan chat

If you can, can you help me? All I need to know is how to fix them.</description>
