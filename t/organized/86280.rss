    <description>Would anyone happen to know how to make the Compiler in the server to read the files from folders, like for example, make a folder called CFG and put all the cfg files in there, make a folder called java and put all the JAVA files in there, and etc. anyone know how to? thank you if you try to help me btw. =)</description>

              <p>well it is possible because I HAVE seen it on other servers, just took a quick look at the compiler, only put .JAVA files into the folder SRC, can’t find for Cfg, still reading =/.</p>
<p>kinda offtopic: how did your project go AlienScape? was it successful?</p>
<p>edit: for example</p>
<p><code>title Compiler
goto cjc
:c2
if exist src (goto cl) else (goto c3)
:c3
if exist *.java (goto cl2) else (goto ce)
:c4
%javac% -cp . *.java
echo Files Compiled Successfully!
pause
cls
goto menu
:c5
%javac% -cp . .\src\*.java
echo Files Compiled Successfully!
pause
move .\src\*.class .\classes\
cls</code></p>
<p>the part:<code>if exist src (goto cl) else (goto c3)</code> so if that directory exists it would read from there and if it doesn’t exist it would just read the ‘screen’ in which the compiler is placed. the part (goto c3) it would go to this:</p>
<p><code>if exist *.java (goto cl2) else (goto ce)
:c4
%javac% -cp . *.java
echo Files Compiled Successfully!</code></p>
<p>so all file extensions with .java would be read and compiled. so yeah =/</p>
