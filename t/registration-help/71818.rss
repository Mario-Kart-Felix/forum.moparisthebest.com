    <description>Ok I know this has nothing to do with a server but I didn&#39;t really know where to put this. My friend forget his password and went to reset it but never got a e-mail. So then he made a new new e-mail and tried makeing a new account on here but the same thing happened with that too. So I think the e-mail thing is down can someone please look into this. THANKS!!!</description>
