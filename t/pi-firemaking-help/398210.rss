    <description>Trying to improve/add Firemaking.
Here&#39;s the issue:
I added Firemaking.
- Added to ItemonItem.
- Added to Client.java
- But when I light the logs..
&quot;You attempt to light the logs&quot;
And it does the anim and whatnot, like it&#39;s suppose to.
Once done, I guess it lights but the fire doesn&#39;t show (don&#39;t got a problem with that tbh.)
But then after it stands back up you don&#39;t lose the logs and when you use the tinderbox on the logs again it says &quot;Please wait till the logs have been lit.&quot; So obviously it&#39;s still trying to light? O.o...</description>
