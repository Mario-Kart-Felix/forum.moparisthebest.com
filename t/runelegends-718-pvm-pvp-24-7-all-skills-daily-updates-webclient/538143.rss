[B][U]First, I would like to say that I&#39;m the Coder/Owner and have decided to make a much better advertising, then you will enjoy it.
And I have spent some time on it, 
And I hope, you guys will not say anything bad about it :P[/U][/B]

[B][U]Here&#39;s an important part, which will be good to remember: So some players computer is bad or slow, and therefore 
it will lagg, and maybe your accounts will be glicthed (I&#39;ve tested it plenty of times but it is not happening with me, 
only to a few players), so therefore, I would recommend you to edit, go to graphics options and change to Min and 
Fixed screen, and then it will be better for those who do not have a good computer(We have tested it and it worked, for most players)

We&#39;ve actually got a lot of players, and all of them are friendly. So come and play with us! 
And I am coding everyday and I see what I can do/add. And, as I said, I will listen to almost all the suggestions which our players come up with. So come and play with us!

Ok now we start, you must choose a name that you want to use, and a password that you&#39;ll remember. Ok when you 

are logged in, you will be given the opportunity to change/choose your clothes, and choose the colors you want, 

and so on, and after it there will be a cutscene, which will show you the basic things/area of RuneLegends. And 

here&#39;s an important part, which will be good to remember: So some peoples computer is bad or slow, and therefore 

it will lagg, and maybe your accounts will be glicthed (I&#39;ve tested it plenty of times, but it is not happening with me, 

only to a few players), so therefore, I would recommend you to edit, go to graphics options and change to Min and 

Fixed screen, and then it will be better for those who do not have a good computer(We have tested it and it worked, 

for most players)

Balloon animals were encountered during the Prison random event. Players decide that they will play or leave the 

game (event). Due to the fact that there is someone who may not understand and anyone can understand so there 

are two ways, either leave or play. Players pulled the lever besides the barriers to get an image of the balloon 

animal that they are supposed to pop. Players then popped at the least three of these to obtain the prison keys 

inside them. In this random event you did not get an emote nor a costume. When you&#39;ve got the key, you will receive 

a mysterious box that you can get some things from. And when you&#39;re done, you can leave the game either by 

clicking on the door or just telehome.

Ok, and here is Castle Wars, a minigame which almost all players like to play, it works very well. And we are always 

playing Castle Wars with our players.

Ok, and here there is a Higscore which lists all the stats, you can see all those players who are online by doing 

::Stats (name).

Ok, now there will be more pictures, and I want to write a little something about the first picture, the small chest is 

max cape you have to have all skills at 99 to get it and there is also a comp cape stand, as there are some 

requirements to.

Ok, here there will be more pictures shows, enjoy them!
