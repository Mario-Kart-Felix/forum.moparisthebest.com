    <description>Ok I just started coding summoning into the devoultion source and i was playing around and had a great idea but i&#39;m not sure how to go about coding it so if anyone could help i would be grateful. :)

well here is what i need to do for starters   //then the idea will come next :)

1.  Add summoning to devolution source 38%complete

2.  Change farming skill to summoning skill
 
3.  Make the summoned npc&#39;s unattackable by yourself and otherplayers
 
4.  Make it where you can only summon 1 npc at a time
     (a)and be able to unsummon the npc at a click of its name

5.  make it where you can heal the summoned npc by using food on it

6.  make the summoned npc&#39;s  beable to talk back with using an item

7.  make players be able to make the summoned npc&#39;s fight each other ----------The idea---------

8.  make it like a duel to where you can stake items and such

9.  add rules also to the fights

10. make it so when you win the duel you get what was staked and summoning exp

11. get summoning exp by using mithril seeds(itemId 299) on these objects
     903 - Unicorn&#39;s head - Alas poor unicorn, I knew him well.
     904 - Dragon&#39;s head - The scary-looking head of a scary-looking dragon.
     906 - Bull&#39;s head - Looks like the bull lost.
     908 - Demonic symbol - Not everyone&#39;s idea of a nice wall decoration.
     910 - Evil eye decoration - Looks like an eye with huge lashes.
     2149 - Obelisk - An imposing stone structure.
     2150 - Obelisk of Earth - A column of elemental power.
     2151 - Obelisk of Water - A column of elemental power.
     2152 - Obelisk of Air - A column of elemental power.
     2153 - Obelisk of Fire - A column of elemental power.

12. To make your summoned npc be able to die when you do.



Well thats my plan But I know I may not be able to do it alone.

So any Help would be much aprecciated
Thank You

              <p>[quote=“joshlolzorzfuckinpwnzz, post:2, topic:183238”]Sounds alright, but one of your points were to make the summoned npcs un-attackable by yourself or other players, so when are they going to “dissapear”?</p>
<p>If they were unattackable till you log out it’s a bit stupid, eh? becuase you cant have 20 npcs following you everywhere you go, anyway…</p>
<p>If you got a way around that then good luck ;)[/quote]</p>
<p>ok good point on the disappear thing i will need to add in to where when you click the monsters name it summons him and while he is summoned you cant summon any other monster since you can only summon 1 npc at a time but if you click his name while he is summoned then it will unsummon or delete him and maybe put a timer for between summoning.</p>
<p>maybe a timer for like if you unsummon an npc then you will have to wait like 10-15secs before summoning another monster or make it like agility and when energy runs out your npc gets deleted (not during fights{cock fights :)}) but maybe somthing like that I wonder if i can do that.</p>
<p>anyways Thanks for pointing some stuff out</p>
