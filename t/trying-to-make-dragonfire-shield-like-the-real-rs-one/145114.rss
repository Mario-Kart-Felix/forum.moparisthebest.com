    <title>Trying to make dragonfire shield like the real rs one</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trying-to-make-dragonfire-shield-like-the-real-rs-one/145114</link>
    <description>well I&#39;m trying to make the dragonfire shield shoot fire like the real rs one.
I want it when you are below 20 hp, it shoots fire randomly, and i have everything correct, except one thing.

I need a way to tell it something related to:

if(isattackingsomething) {
then put the void to make it shoot a flame gfx
but it freezes everytime it tries to shoot fire.

I am using the (1) gfx, which is dragonfire single breath. Please help..</description>

              <p>oh my, delta, that is a scratch off the surface for the coding this guy is gonna need, but, i like to help, so, heres what you need to do.</p>
<p>Create public ints for the dragonfire breath, and add the int addition to all dragon’s attack.<br>
You probably want to make a new save line in moreinfo, also you need to add in attacking on, the methed for only if a person has 20 hp or less.</p>
<p>Now try the item cases, if you use pimpscape, and dont know what to do here, serch for the Yo-Yo ID, and serch it in client.java. This is really only a start, becuase something like that is sorta complex.</p>
