[font=arial][size=16px]Hamza[/size][/font] bin Laden at the age of 10 on an archive photo from 2001
Hamza, the youngest son of Osama bin Laden during the invasion in Abbottabadescaped the deadly hail of bullets from the U.S. Navy Seals. He managed to escapeand and now his 20 year old son is seeking revenge.

The Prince of terror, &quot;as Hamza bin Laden is also called, was groomed fromchildhood to follow his father as head of al-Qaida. At age 15 he appeared on screenin an armed propaganda video. In this video he wore a poem calling for America,Britain, France and Denmark to destroy.

Secret services suspect that he was involved in the assassination of Pakistanipolitician Benazir Bhutto in 2007.

U.S. forces initially thought they had killed Hamza in their attack on the residence ofbin Laden in Pakistan. Later it appeared that he was mistaken for two years his elder brother Khalid. (ad / sg)</description>
