    <title>[PI] Fight Pits Rewards</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-fight-pits-rewards/373895</link>
    <description>Wondered how to do a few things in a PI source:

[ul][li][b]Award pest control points/currency as a reward to the winner of a fight pits match.[/b][/li]
[li][b]Award pest control points/currency after completing a slayer task.[/b][/li][/ul]

[hr]
I&#39;ve ran through the pestcontrol class and found the function referring to a reward that&#39;s given at the end of a round to the winner, but no item id is displayed, even though barrows gloves are given. I figured then that the reward is maybe handled in the plaver class or under cases, or otherwise. But I don&#39;t want to spend hours rooting through files when someone here might possibly know.
[hr]
If anyone could help me out I&#39;d greatly appreciate it, and would gladly offer rep++. And as far as the slayer rewards are concerned I&#39;m just posting that in case it&#39;s common knowledge and could easily be explained, and if not I&#39;ll just look that one up in the snippets section. Only reason I ask about this is because on this forum, &quot;the other forum&quot;, and &quot;the other other forum&quot; I couldn&#39;t find a snippet or tutorial on it. 

Thank you in advance.</description>

I’ve ran through the pestcontrol class and found the function referring to a reward that’s given at the end of a round to the winner, but no item id is displayed, even though barrows gloves are given. I figured then that the reward is maybe handled in the plaver class or under cases, or otherwise. But I don’t want to spend hours rooting through files when someone here might possibly know.<br>
