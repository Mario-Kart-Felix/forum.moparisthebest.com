    <title>Where to find combat animations?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-to-find-combat-animations/547590</link>
    <description>Hey there guys, looking for some information.

I want to fix the fact that no NPC&#39;s have combat/death animations in the source I am working with (entrinthy, by the way). I know about the NPC file that tells the server which animations to use, but I don&#39;t know what it is referencing for the numbers. Some are still -1 and whatnot, and the NPC&#39;s just stand there while attacking. 

Can anyone point me to the right files that list the animations, or do I need to get a Cache Editor and pull things apart to find them? 

ps - 718 source</description>

<p>Chances are you’ll probably have to just test animations until you get the right one. I suppose you could make a command and keep trying them all out until you find the one that works. But I don’t think there is a map that tells you what animations go to what skeleton. Because it does use a skeleton system, any entity can perform any animation. Perhaps with strange results, but it’s still valid.</p>
