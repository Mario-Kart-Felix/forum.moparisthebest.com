    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-delta-changing-exp-given-by-attack-styles/395629</link>
    <description>I&#39;m having an issue with the exp given to skills when selecting an attack style. currently ALL styles only give attack exp, making it impossible to train anything but attack. How would i go about making a different attack style give exp to a different skill?</description>
