    <description>I would like to get these portals at these locations...

I would like a portal at 3210,3433 And I want it to bring me to the KQ lair.
I would like a portal at 3209,3433 And I want it to bring me to the KBD lair.
I would also like a portal at 3209,3434 and have it bring me to the Castle Wars....


If someone can tell me at least how to make these codes.. I would appreciate it. If you would do that. If you can make the codes for me, for them things. I would appreciate that even more!!

Please help me.. I want these badly!</description>
