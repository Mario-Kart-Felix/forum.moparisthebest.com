    <title>Eminem Songs Compilation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/eminem-songs-compilation/364884</link>
    <description>I took 27 Eminem songs and put them into a long paragraph to honor his birthday. I used The Way I Am twice.

&quot;My Mom&quot; took &quot;Purple Pills&quot; because &quot;The Way I Am&quot; made her &quot;Just Loose It&quot;, it was &quot;3 AM&quot; and I was on an &quot;8 Mile Road&quot; because I wanted to &quot;Kill You&quot; but &quot;My Mom&quot; was &quot;Cleaning Out My Closet&quot; and found &quot;Kim&quot; and threatened me with &quot;25 to Life&quot;. I didn&#39;t want to be a &quot;Criminal&quot; so I hit her with a &quot;Medicine Ball&quot; while grabbing &quot;My Balls&quot; and yelling &quot;Here We Go&quot;. I rounded up my possy &quot;Like Toy Soldiers&quot; and our group was &quot;Almost Famous&quot; then we hit &quot;Rock Bottom&quot; but had &quot;No Apologies&quot;. I was a bad &quot;Role Model&quot; and I was &quot;Saying Goodbye to Hollywood&quot; and &quot;Space Bound&quot; and didn&#39;t recognize &quot;The Warning&quot;. &quot;The Way I Am&quot; has changed from when I felt like &quot;Superman&quot; and didn&#39;t &quot;Sing for the Moment&quot;, instead just waited &quot;Till I Collapse&quot; and put the &quot;Nail in the Coffin&quot;.</description>
