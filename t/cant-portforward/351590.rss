    <title>Can&#39;t portforward?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-portforward/351590</link>
    <description>soo, i have a Linksys WRT120N wireless router, and when i try to go to the web interface, the box that asks for the username and pass keeps coming back after i enter the user/pass thing. I&#39;ve tried the factory defaults (admin, administrator, password, etc.) and I&#39;ve tried every pass i can think of that could have been used for it. i&#39;ve tried the automatic port forwarding .jar thing, but it always says something like &quot;cannot automatically portforward&quot; in the servers cmd prompt. Also I&#39;ve tried utorrent, i followed a guide on here, and i leave utorrent up, i have my no-ip updated, but i still can&#39;t log into my server.

anyone know why I can&#39;t portforward, or maybe another way to do it if there is a way</description>

<p>that would work, except i can’t get to the routers web interface, it wont accept any passwords and such that i try. I’ve also tried holding the reset button for 30 and 60 seconds, still nothing.</p>

<p>Okay as you’ve tried the defaults the best thing to do is to reset your router, push the small reset button with a needle or whatever and hold it for 30 seconds. Then you can log in with factory defaults and set it up.</p>
