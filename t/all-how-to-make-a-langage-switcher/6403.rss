[u]How to make a language switcher[/u]
This is VERY easy.
If you try to run a client for the first time, you probably do it with this batch file:
[code]java client[/code]
That should work with most java programs.
Well, if you do it with the client, you will get this error:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Usage: worldid, [live/office/local], [live/rc/wip], [lowmem/highmem], [free/members], [english/german]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This mean you have to add that to the batch file.
But, you can choose between the worlds, between live/office/local, live/rc/wip, lowmem/highmem, free/members and english/german.
Run the client now with this batch file:
[code]java client 30 live rc lowmem free english[/code]
Now, the client will run normally.
But, did you noticed you can also choose between english/german?
So, run the client with this batch file:
[code]java client 30 live rc lowmem free german[/code]
And now the client runs, normally, but german :P.
But you cant switch easily...
So, make some menus, like this:
[code]@echo off

	:mainmenu
	echo c - Start client
	echo e - Exit
	SET /p choise=You choose: 
	if %choise%==c goto language
	if %choise%==e goto exit

	:language
	SET /p LANG=english or german: 
	if %LANG%==english SET LANG=english
	if %LANG%==german SET LANG=german
	pause
	java client 30 live rc lowmem free %LANG%
	pause

	:exit
	exit[/code]
mainmenu is the first menu you see, where you can choose what you want to do.
language is he menu where you can choose what language you want to use, and then it does the java client ... etc. thing.
exit will end the CMD.

In language, it will set ... lowmem free %LANG%.
It basicly &quot;writes&quot; english or german.

Now you can add things if you want, but you at least have the language switcher now.
But, please dont leach the lang switcher, learn from it.
