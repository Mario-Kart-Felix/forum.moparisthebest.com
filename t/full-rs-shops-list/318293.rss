    <title>Full RS shops list?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/full-rs-shops-list/318293</link>
    <description>Hi, I was wondering if any of you have a complete shops list for RuneScape. It would be greatly appreciated, I don&#39;t think I could stand typing that much.

Oh, and I did search, and I couldn&#39;t find anything.


Thanks in advance.</description>
