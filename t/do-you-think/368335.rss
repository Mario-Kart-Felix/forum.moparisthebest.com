<p>Ok stop with the <em>sigh</em> shit because it doesn’t make you look mature.

</aside>
<p>Theres been numerous discussions of Runescape Vs WoW. Just search for them. Which is why I sighed. You asked which direction they are going in and I gave a reason. I gave my opinion very clearly and if you don’t want it why the hell did you make a thread.</p>

<p>yes, but they are almost reaching the concept of classes. by allowing you to look like a smither or whatever. I’m just saying it may become some what of WOW<br>

<p>Sigh… Here we go again with another thread of why RS is turning into WoW.</p>
<p>The market of todays world is slowly depleting, especially I’d say for online computer gaming (my opinion).</p>
<p>Runescape will not only be generating ideas from WoW, but from any other online gaming community. Have you noticed how many people WoW has to Runescape? Well Jagex obviously is going to steal ideas to suit gamers, to resemble other games. They have to make the game of what PLAYERS want to a point (they had to remove pking, ect).[/quote]</p>
