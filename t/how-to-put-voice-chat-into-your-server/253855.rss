    <title>How to put Voice Chat into your Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-put-voice-chat-into-your-server/253855</link>
    <description>Ok so, You cant put it in your client, but you can make a free voice chat that connects with your Webclient or Just your forums. Here is what you need.


Download VoiceChat at - http://www.vimas.com/wvchat.htm

Create a new directory on your server and copy the following files into this new directory (Example: /VoiceChat): 
VCServer.jar 
voice.cfg 
start.sh 
stop.sh 
restart.sh 
start_Win32.bat 
registration key file (in demo mode it is absent) 
Starting server: 
Windows:

If you have Windows , you may use the start_Win32.bat file, or start server by command:

java -jar pathname/VCServer.jar - where pathname is path to voice chat server

Unix:

In the Unix environment you may use script file start.sh or start server by command:

java -jar ./pathname/VCServer.jar &gt; out.txt &amp; - where pathname is path to voice chat server

Note 1: Also there are three script files for server management: start.sh, stop.sh, restart.sh. They can be used for simple automatic server management by running them in Unix shell or in Cron jobs. If you use these script files, server will run in background mode. For using scripts you have to change their permission to 744 using command chmod and put them into the same directory with server.

Note 2: In order to run web voice chat server in a Unix environment, you must either have telnet access or SSH interface. 

Note 3: The start_Win32.bat and start.sh can be used to start server in Demo mode only. Read in the &quot;Registration&quot; section how to start server with registration key.

Web Voice Chat application uses, by default, TCP connection to 7777, 7778 ports. So, check to be sure that TCP connection to 7777, 7778 ports are allowed. These ports can be changed in the voice.cfg config file. 
Note: if ports setting changed in file voice.cfg, don`t forget to change port settings for applets in applet parameters. There is only text port must be set.

Note: an easy way to test these ports is just to use a simple telnet session:
telnet yourserver.com 7777
You should see a message that says: ‘Name?’

For debugging purposes voice chat server creates the VCserver.log and out.txt files. Vcserver.log and out.txt are saved in the same directory where server application is. On the client computer the Client.log file is created also. 
TOP

Applets installation
Create a new directory on your server and save the following files into this new directory: 

VChat.jar 
jduplex16kwin3.tar 
jduplex16kmac2.tar 
wvchat_c.html 
logo_chat.gif 
smiles.zip 
lang.xml 
conference_help.html 
private_help.html 
public_help.html 
Create in the new directory /sounds subfolder. Put into /sounds subfolder:

invite.au 
new_text.au 
new_user.au

 Getting it to Work:
There are many ways, but the simplest is to Change the wvchat_c.html to a php file, and making a new Directory and attaching it to your webclient.

Ok now just put it in your forums, You can have it attach to your webclient by changing where it loads, default is middle.


I had some problems getting other people to load it, but if you have any brains at all you will figure out what it needs to run.


If anyone needs any help just post here. This was a fast tutorial, and I might not have covered everything needed.


   ** And yes I know there&#39;s Ventrillo and other sort of programs, but this one is free and VERY simple to implement into anywhere, so I figured some people might want it.

              <p>WAV is not a compressed audio format, resulting in 10* the size of mp3. This idea i dont much like, as its still external and for that reason id just use something proper like ventrilo/team speak. If this were properly integrated into the server as Peter said then it may have use. Just my 2c</p>

<p>Kill bandwidth much? WAV files are gigantic.</p>
<p>Anyways, there are tons of ways to get voice chat into your server if you really want it. Personally I’d go with Ventrilo because it’s already implemented and requires very little setup.</p>

<p>java -jar ./pathname/VCServer.jar &gt; out.txt &amp; - where pathname is path to voice chat server</p>
<p>Note 1: Also there are three script files for server management: start.sh, stop.sh, restart.sh. They can be used for simple automatic server management by running them in Unix shell or in Cron jobs. If you use these script files, server will run in background mode. For using scripts you have to change their permission to 744 using command chmod and put them into the same directory with server.</p>
<p>Note 2: In order to run web voice chat server in a Unix environment, you must either have telnet access or SSH interface.</p>
<p>Note 3: The start_Win32.bat and start.sh can be used to start server in Demo mode only. Read in the “Registration” section how to start server with registration key.</p>
<p>Web Voice Chat application uses, by default, TCP connection to 7777, 7778 ports. So, check to be sure that TCP connection to 7777, 7778 ports are allowed. These ports can be changed in the voice.cfg config file.<br>
Note: if ports setting changed in file voice.cfg, don`t forget to change port settings for applets in applet parameters. There is only text port must be set.</p>
<p>Note: an easy way to test these ports is just to use a simple telnet session:<br>
telnet <a href="http://yourserver.com" rel="nofollow noopener">yourserver.com</a> 7777<br>
You should see a message that says: ‘Name?’</p>
<p>For debugging purposes voice chat server creates the VCserver.log and out.txt files. Vcserver.log and out.txt are saved in the same directory where server application is. On the client computer the Client.log file is created also.<br>

<p>Applets installation<br>
Create a new directory on your server and save the following files into this new directory:</p>
<p>VChat.jar<br>
jduplex16kwin3.tar<br>
jduplex16kmac2.tar<br>
wvchat_c.html<br>
logo_chat.gif<br>
smiles.zip<br>
lang.xml<br>
conference_help.html<br>
private_help.html<br>
public_help.html<br>
Create in the new directory /sounds subfolder. Put into /sounds subfolder:</p>
<p>invite.au<br>
new_text.au<br>
new_user.au</p>
<p>Getting it to Work:<br>
There are many ways, but the simplest is to Change the wvchat_c.html to a php file, and making a new Directory and attaching it to your webclient.</p>
<p>Ok now just put it in your forums, You can have it attach to your webclient by changing where it loads, default is middle.</p>
<p>I had some problems getting other people to load it, but if you have any brains at all you will figure out what it needs to run.</p>
<p>If anyone needs any help just post here. This was a fast tutorial, and I might not have covered everything needed.</p>
<p>** And yes I know there’s Ventrillo and other sort of programs, but this one is free and VERY simple to implement into anywhere, so I figured some people might want it.</p>
<p>**** a working sample is here <a href="http://64.244.62.45/voicechat.php" rel="nofollow noopener">http://64.244.62.45/voicechat.php</a></p>
