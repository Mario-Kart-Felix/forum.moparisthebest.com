    <description>hello, well, i don&#39;t know if its the right section, anyway, sorry if its not, but i need help. 

i got a SmartAX MT882 Router and i wanna portfoward it because...

History:

I have had another internet provider that gave a router and i has an excellent no-ip server...but i changed my internet and the provider gave me a ROUTER!

SmartAX MT882 , and...what happened? i put my server on and call people to join...and they can&#39;t enter. People say in forums that they have the same problem , and they have &quot;Routers too&quot; so they &quot;portfowarded&quot; his router and now they have a no-ip server back. Please help me to fix this problem! i wanna have my 24/7 server back with no-ip.

My Msn is: [email]faivmu@hotmail.com[/email]

Add me, give me your Msn, or answer me here, please.</description>
