You need to know how to access your router…<br>
What you wana do is go to: 192.168.1.1 or it could be different for your router.<br>
Then once you get on the page, your gonna see it asking you for a “Username” and a "password"<br>
Usually most routers come stock as: Username: Admin  Password: Admin<br>
If not, you should be able to find it under your router.<br>
You wana login, once you login, your gonna look for “Advanced Settings” , “Port” or "port forwarding"<br>
Then once you find it, your gonna wana find your computer’s IP, the IP which the router has assigned to your computer…<br>
Which can be found simply by: Opening up “Command Prompt” Once opened, type: ipconfig<br>
Then you should be able to see multiple IP’s and connections… your gonna find yours in your “wireless LAN” section…<br>
Or you could find out by looking in the “Status” bar on your router’s config page, which is when you login after going to “192.168.1.1” Once you get your IP your gonna wana put it in the port forwarding area and then forward this port “43594” “43595” depending on your server’s port… Your gonna need to forward it as “TCP&amp;UDP” Then SAVE and you should be able to go! You can check if it’s working by going to: " <a href="http://www.canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">www.canyouseeme.org</a> " run your source/base/server while you check though. Make sure your computers firewall is not blocking the port and it’s allowing it through. You can manually allow it through by going to your firewall settings “advanced settings” … Also make sure that your routers firewall isn’t blocking it!<br>
I’m sorry for my terrible english and explaining. Hope this helps though!</p>
