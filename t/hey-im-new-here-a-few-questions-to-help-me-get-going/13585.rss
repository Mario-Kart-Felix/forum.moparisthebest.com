    <description>Hey evferyone, im quite new to the scar community but am realy interested and wanna get making autos now!

got a few questions to ask befor i get going tho

1- what things to jagex pick up on with SCAR i know same lenth between mose clicks and posistion but am a loss to how else they might detect you.

2- my first prog i wanna make is one that just times all my mose clicks and the spaces between them. this is so i can put human like randomness in my final script but i dnt know a timeimg function:S

lastly if andone could explane MoovMouseSmoothFromEx any better to me, it looks the best for moving move human like, or am i wrong and is they a better way

thanx to anyone spending the time to help me out, and hope i become more useful to the community in the near feature(i have BIG plans) thanx again

MarkTime(Mark);<br>
Mouse(x,y,0,0);<br>
TheTimeFromIt:=TimeFromMark(Mark);</p>

<p>They pick up on a fast mouse and a fast click. Such as if you used clickmouse alone, that is very detectable, but if you used a procedure that would click and hold the mouse for a random amount of time, and then release the click and wait randomly again, then it would be humanlike.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you use SRL you can use their TimeRunning function and it will show you how long the script is running.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>MoveMouseSmoothEx is confusing for me, but I normally put in 5s or 10s in the positions I don’t know, and later I just mess around with the numbers lol.</p>
<p>Here’s a funny one.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">program New;
begin
  MoveMouseSmoothEx(0, 0, 0, 100, 50, 1, 10000);
end.</code></pre>
