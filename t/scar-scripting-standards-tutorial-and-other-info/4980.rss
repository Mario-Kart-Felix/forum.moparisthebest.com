Bad Standards!
[img]http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/9666/badstandardsqq2.jpg[/img]

Try that code. As you can see, it works, but if you ever wanted to change something in it, then it would be a hassle. That is just a very small peice of code I concocked very quickly, but you should see other people&#39;s cose. 300 or 400 lines of code, and it doesn&#39;t have good coding standards. Here is a good example of the script I just showed you, with good standards.

Good Standards!

It&#39;s very simple. Here are the rules.

[ul][*] Tree your code AKA display the code in a neat format. Example...[/ul]
[code]
Begin
 Repeat
  WriteLn(&#39;wow&#39;);
 Until(False)
End.
[/code]
Another Example only this time we used Tab to tree the code: 
[code]
Begin
     Repeat
           WriteLn(&#39;wow&#39;);
     Until(False)
End.
[/code]
[ul][*] Try to comment most parts of it, that way it&#39;s easier to find where you left off from and it&#39;s easier for someone else to debug your code.
[*] Try to make everything user friendly. Take the first code&#39;s instructions on the Const setup. It wasn&#39;t too descriptive.
[*] Use procedures instead of putting all your code right in between the Begin and End. commands.
[*] Use ; at the end of each command such as... WriteLn(&#39;asdkjaskldj&#39;); and SendKeys(&#39;asdasdasds&#39;);
[*] Try to keep functions and procedures in the proper case. Such as the procedure WriteLn. Don&#39;t write it like writeln. Same with IntToStr and StrToInt and the 1000s of others.[/ul]


I hope you learned something. :)

~Ron

PS: Yeah I know the Const doesn&#39;t affect the script at all. It was just there to show you, how you can make it neat and show you how to setup the instructions for other people.</description>

Thanks Kyle, but I knew that. I was just trying to show every part of code people normally use. I forgot If statements though. And besides. You get the point. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Also, thank you thief. If any of you guys sees someone without using standards, just link them to this tutorial! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
