    <title>I need a good base</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-a-good-base/446811</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve just recently came back into the world of RSPS and all these new fancy revisions and PI servers and what not are around and i have no idea what in the fuck PI means....but beside that I&#39;m trying to catch up with it all and find a good base source+client. I&#39;ve been reading around and people suggest certain ones(forgot the names) and I&#39;ve downloaded a few and it all looks really odd to me. Delta is extremely simple to me, but everyone thinks it&#39;s shit so.....I need a new base! What are your guys favorite bases or what do you recommend for me to start a huge project on. i was going for an economy server taking some ideas from Dodian(my favorite server of all time) but i couldn&#39;t get it right so i gave up. Thanks in advance , if you actually read this lol</description>

              <p>yeah, it is actually a lot nicer, there are hardly any customs in it, 99% of them are in a folder, you just have to put them in. It is super easy. You can always move things.</p>
