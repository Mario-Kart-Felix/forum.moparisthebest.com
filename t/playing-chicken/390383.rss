    <title>Playing Chicken</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/playing-chicken/390383</link>
    <description>So I was heading to Kroger( a corporate supermarket in the states), today and I saw this front row parking spot the other car could clearly see I was already near that spot and was actually turning in of all things. When the car of all items revs up like crazy and make about a 225 degree turn to quickly enter the spot when I was still turning in to get the spot. 

Now I own a really nice 2003 Chevy Avalanche, it&#39;s a fairly big truck and I didn&#39;t want for it to get scratched so i didn&#39;t try to do anything to prevent it but still some people are just so rude. I mean I could understand if they were really in a hurry...but the guy in the other car took like five minutes to get out of the car so he apparently wasn&#39;t in a hurry. 

Things like this just irritate me to no end. I just wanted to get that off of my chest.
