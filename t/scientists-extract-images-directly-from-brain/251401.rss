    <description>Source: http://digg.com/general_sciences/Scientists_extract_images_directly_from_brain

&lt;blockquote&gt;Japan’s ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories have developed new brain analysis technology that can reconstruct the images inside a person ’s mind and display them on a computer monitor, it was announced on December 11. Further development of the technology may soon make it possible to view other people’s dreams while they sleep.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Imagine the endless possibilities of this, like dream recording and other things.</description>

<p>You’re confusing mental state with the visual cortex. This machine would replicate exactly what is going through your visual cortex, ignoring your entire mental state of “being multiple realities” or whatever.</p>

For example, when the person is asleep, you use the machine to capture the dreams.<br>
And to test if it was his real dream, you question the person and later on you show the images that were captured.<br>
Then you compare.</p>

<p>but the image that comes up, you will either recognise right away and be like ‘omg i remember that!!! the machine works!!!’ or you wont recognize it at all, and the scientists will be like ‘omg, it must be from your subconscious!!! our machine works!!!’</p>
<p>so, this machine will produce images that cant possibly be considered fact. Even if it can bring pictures from your mind 1005 correctly, your mind can create images based on your perseption of what you think the event is… so using it on criminals to get ‘confessions’ will just prove that they can comprehend what the crime actualy was, and could have just created the event in there head using imagination.</p>
<p>Great idea… but useless.</p>
