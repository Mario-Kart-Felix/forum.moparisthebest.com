    <title>Obstacles do damage</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/obstacles-do-damage/418077</link>
    <description>I need some help with obstacles, I want them to do damage. Say as a swinging pendulum in Rogue&#39;s Den Agility Course. 

How would I make that attack a player standing in the coords, when the ball hits him?

I need some help, and I tried different ways as set coords boolean. Such as object Damage, but that didn&#39;t work.</description>

<p>If you just walk past it, it makes it a little bit more difficult (as you have discovered).</p>
<p>the only thing I can think of would be to add a list of stipulations to the walking part of the server, but eventually it would become filled with garbage (like the common <span class="bbcode-i">process()</span>)[/quote]</p>
<p>You can’t click it, I could edit that in the client but I’d rather the real thing.</p>
