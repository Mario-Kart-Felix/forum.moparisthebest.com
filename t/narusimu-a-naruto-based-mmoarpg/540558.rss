Hello guys, I&#39;m going to keep this short.


I&#39;m currently working on a project called Narusimu. It&#39;s an MMOARPG in development that tries to simulate a universe like that of Naruto&#39;s in a very hard-core realistic way.


More info about Narusimu here:

Right now our team is in desperate need of a skilled character modeler and animator. So if you happen to know someone or maybe you are someone who loves Naruto and is willing to contribute to a project like Narusimu, then let me know :) 


Narusimu currently stands in the IndieDB Top 10. We get an average of about 20 daily registrations and our website is averagely visited 3k times daily. We have a great supportive community so you&#39;d be working on something that can be enjoyed by many.


There are other positions open as well, so if you&#39;re not a (character) modeler but you think you can help out with something else, then please let me know as well.


This is in no way meant as advertisement although it may seem like it. It&#39;s an attempt of expanding our development team. 


Thank you for your attention.

              <p>All those questions are thoroughly discussed and answered in our forum and a FAQ is being made by one of our guys as we speak. But I’ll answer them real quick because it’s 2 am and I got to get some sleep.</p>
<p>Question 1: We will not be using any intellectual property from Naruto, everything in our universe will be unique. We merely share the same ancient Asian principles and folklore in our universes.</p>
<p>Question 3: Unity.</p>
<p>Question 2: Completely in C# with the Mono framework. In the future we’ll probably have to add functionity to the engine using native plugins that will be written in C++.</p>
<p>Question 4 &amp; 7: As of now we have no budget and expect completely free development. Donations are covering small expenses.</p>
<p>Question 5: I’m the lead programmer, we have a level designer, a concept artist, a couple of testers, a moderator and a programmer who is currently working on a new main website and will join in content programming when the game’s core system is finished.</p>
<p>Question 6: That’ll depend on how the team will grow. I’m expecting a release of a sort of deathmatch version at the end of this year though. That’ll serve as something to keep people busy while the acual RPG elements are being developed.</p>
