    <title>Atheism</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/atheism/189109</link>
    <description>I haven&#39;t been to church in a long time, which really doesn&#39;t matter at all; I [i]used[/i] to be Roman Catholic. I was just walking around outside yesterday and this idea popped into my mind. I was taught that Jesus was God, but then how did he worship God if he was god himself. This can be called into question for other religions as well. I don&#39;t believe that there is no higher power, but even if there were, where the hell is it?</description>

</aside>
<p>lots of contradictions like this, they are fun to play with</p>
<ol>
<li>if god is all-powerful, can he create something more powerful then himself?</li>
<li>if god is all-knowing, why does he change his mind sometimes?</li>
<li>why did god make jesus die to forgive us? why didnt he just forgive us without death, who is god trying to impress?</li>
</ol>
<p>i love how religious people only accept the science which helps them, for other science, they say “we dont believe in that, we only need our belief in god”<br>
lets say they found jesus’ bones, and examined the DNA to find that jesus has no father, only a mother<br>
would they say “we dont believe in that”, no they wouldn’t, they say “science is proving us right”</p>
<p>if all the evidence in the world pointed towards the existence of god, i would be the first to admit it</p>
