    <title>Alcohol doesn&#39;t kill off brain cells</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/alcohol-doesnt-kill-off-brain-cells/123146</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;NEW research, to be revealed at a conference of some of the world&#39;s top neuroscientists in Cairns today, has found alcohol does not kill off brain cells as always thought.

For years imbibers have been told a big night on the drink wipes out entire sections of human brain cell function with much the same destructive equivalent as a napalm bombing strike. 

According to Queensland Brain Institute director Professor Perry Bartlett, this is not true. 

There is no evidence drinking alcohol leads directly to the death of brain cells, he said. 

&quot;Some of the best studies, done in Italy, show a bottle of wine a night can reduce the risk of dementia in old age,&quot; Professor Bartlett said. 

In moderation, alcohol has positive benefits for blood vessel health and stroke prevention. And, as an added bonus, new brain cells are generated every day of our lives. 

Research by Professor Bartlett and his team has found we all have an inbuilt repair kit replenishing the more than 100 billion cells - or neurons - in our brain.
