    <description>Hi i&#39;m new at coding and all but i found an ok source. its called project 16. im looking for a better one with a client that does not have an IP slot. i want it to be automatic so the players can just open it and type in user and pass. I also want a server pre-loaded with godswords and bandos. if anyone has this PLEASE HELP. im also looking for a way to copy and paste where all of the stuff goes like its supposed to instead of in one big line.</description>
