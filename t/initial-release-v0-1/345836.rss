    <description>It is getting good reviews so far on the market, what do you think of it?  What can be improved besides file selection that I already plan to implement?</description>

Honestly, I prefer names over the apk files because half the time when you go to restore them, they’re outdated.</p>

<p>Not only are the apk files usually outdated when you go to restore them, they don’t show up in the market so you can’t get updates, AND they take up a lot more space than a text file.</p>
<p>And yes, I was planning on implementing a progress bar in the near future, thanks for the feedback! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
