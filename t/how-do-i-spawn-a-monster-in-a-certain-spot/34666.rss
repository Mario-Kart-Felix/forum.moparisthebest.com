    <title>How do i spawn a monster in a certain spot?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-spawn-a-monster-in-a-certain-spot/34666</link>
    <description>ok well the other day I tried putting a monster in varrock square but after i went into autospawn.cfg and put it the code for it-it said that there was an error and wouldn&#39;t load it. Also whenever I start up the server it always says it loads up only 25 monsters? I&#39;m wondering if that is suppose to happen or not. If anyone could help it would be appreciated.</description>
