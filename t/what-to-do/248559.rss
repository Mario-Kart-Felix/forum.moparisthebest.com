    <title>What to do?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-to-do/248559</link>
    <description>Seriously, I keep getting Syi&#39;d and it&#39;s getting rather inconvenient for not just my game and its users, but for my internet bandwidth as well. What I started doing was taking their IP&#39;s, scanning for ports, and then just simply fiddling around with their computers. Nothing doing, really. But instead, I decided to report the last guy to his ISP for DoS&#39;ing - which is illegal.

Now, what should I do? Should I continue killing computers, or should I just report them to their ISP? Some of the people were smart and actually used proxies making it much harder to find them out, but others were stupid.

Does anyone have any other ideas, or are mine pretty much in-line with everyone else?</description>

I don’t have the time for learning Java, or using the useless tutorials (my source is Silab-based and is rather… different… than most other sources) and my friend, who originally coded it, is never on.<br>

<p>My friend makes the source, and I host it. If he isn’t willing to insert a few lines of code, so be it. Until he does, do you think I am taking the right precautions?</p>
<p>Edit: I see… well, I am currently learning PHP and SQL… one thing at a time buddy…</p>
