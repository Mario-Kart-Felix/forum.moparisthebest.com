    <description>Well my parents piss me off so they sold my xbox + monitor my computer now &gt;.&gt;

Anyways, i JUST moved, and do online school, and trust me, there is no weed or people to chill with.

So what the fuck should i do in my 6 hours of spare time &gt;.&lt;</description>

Having monitored Internet can be annoying at times, but if you are truthful and have good reasons for some things (like my parents saw that NSFW thread on here earlier, I explained about moparscape and I didn’t get in trouble) it works out fine. It’s also helped me stay away from pornography[/quote]Oh god bro.<br>

Nope. Though to be honest I don’t really consider it to be that bad of a violation… like I said they don’t even look at the logs unless something bad pops up.</p>
<p>EDIT 3 - Professional meaning it looks very bad for ANY site to have a pornography section, <span class="bbcode-b">because</span> it is illegal. Just like we wouldn’t ever have a torrent section (and I wouldn’t support it either, even though I do torrent sometimes)</p>
<p>And I guess you could say that’s breaking the law, but to be honest my mom has even asked me to torrent shows for her before. We don’t torrent anything that costs money or a license though. I J-walk too.</p>
<p>Yea, my parents monitor me. You could say it’s because we go to church, or you could say it’s because they don’t want me watching porn. And to be honest, I’m ok with that.</p>
