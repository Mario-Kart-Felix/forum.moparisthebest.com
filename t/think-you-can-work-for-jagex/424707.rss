<p>what i was trying to corner you into thinking but did a bad job of was - every single time there’s an update (an iteration) the shortest path you have computed for each node is no longer guaranteed to be the shortest path. gates may have opened or gates may have closed causing the shortest path to be different. so you have to recompute the shortest path each and every iteration for each and every node until you come up with the final shortest path. this is precisely what an algorithm like bellman-ford does.</p>

As you can see, there is no place here for the speeds as in problem 2 to be used in problem 3; it never mentions them in the specification, nor in the examples given. This means the graph isn't weighted and therefore a breadth-first search approach works fine.

Well currently you have at most 4 edges from any square i.e. one in each cardinal direction (if each is open). You could probably adjust this so that every square also has an edge to themselves, meaning at most 5. The rest of the algorithm would remain untouched.</p>

The only added hurdle is that you need to know square state while traversing it. You can very cheaply find the state of these temporal squares given that the depth of your search (i.e. the steps taken since the beginning) would be the number of updates elapsed:</p>
<p><code>int square = timemap[x][y];
boolean open = square &gt; 0 ? (depth % (square * 2) &lt; depth) : (square == 0); 
</code><br>
or something of that sort.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>I appreciated your summary of how Bellman-Ford worked.<br>
Maybe I’m thinking of the problem incorrectly, but surely the weight could simply be inversely proportional to the speed… for example say w(s) determines the weight given speed:<br>
w(s | s != 0) = 10/s<br>
w(0) = some special constant used to signify an untraversable square. In this case we wouldn’t be trying to use these squares, anyways.</p>
<blockquote>[code]int speedmap[][][/code]
An array of arbitrary size in which a value of zero denotes a solid wall and the numbers 1 to 10 denote how easy a section of floor is to cross. E.g. map squares with a value of 6 can be traversed at twice the speed of squares with a value of 3. Assume that the map is rectangular and not larger than 128 by 128.</blockquote>
<p>The ratios are correctly inverted under this transformation of speed to weight. So, for example, with speeds 6 and 2:<br>
w(6) = 1.666…<br>
w(2) = 5</p>
<p>So…<br>
6/2 = 3 which makes sense; traversing a square at speed 6 is indeed 3 times faster than with speed 2.<br>
w(6)/w(2) = 1/3 which also makes sense; it takes 1/3 of the time to cross a square at speed 6 relative to at speed 2.</p>
<p>These weights aren’t negative and work according to the problem specification, so why can’t A* just be used?</p>
<p>Moving on, the first problem also deals with walls:</p>
<blockquote>[code]boolean solidmap[][][/code]
A map of arbitrary size where true denotes a solid wall and false denotes an empty square. Assume that the map is rectangular and not larger than 128 by 128.</blockquote>
<p>I think you may be misunderstanding the exercise… squares may or may not contain solid walls. Those that do are themselves completely untraversable. Walls do not however exist in between squares.</p>

<p>think of it as redefining the problem to a negative speed is faster than a positive speed. so a speed of -6 is faster than a speed of -2. you end up having to compute the shortest distance for each node every time (relaxing all edges) because your shortest distance assumptions aren’t guaranteed to be correct until you run through each node the number of nodes minus one times.</p>
<p>also, directed and undirected are pretty much the same, all you’re saying is that there’s an edge from u to v and an edge from v to u</p>
<p>also, “in which a value of zero<br>

              <blockquote>[b]Question 1[/b]
A simple top down 2D game features characters that move around a grid. Every time game
update is called, a character checks to see if he is on his destination square and if he is not,
the simpleroute function is called to provide him with the next step that he is required to
take, in order to reach the destination in the fewest moves possible.
Write the following function:
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Parameters:</span></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>A map of arbitrary size where true denotes a solid wall and false denotes an empty square. Assume that the map is rectangular and not larger than 128 by 128.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>The x,y position of the character where cx is their x position and cy is their y position.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>The x,y destination of the character where dx is the x position and dy is the y position</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Return:</span></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>The map position that the character should move to next where nextstep[0] is the x and nextstep[1] is the y. If no route can be found, nextstep should return the character’s current position.</p>
<p><code>static int[] simpleroute( boolean solidmap[][] , int cx , int cy , int dx , int dy )
{
    int nextstep[] = new int[2];
    //Your Code Here
    return nextstep;
}</code></p>
</blockquote><br>
A simple breadth-first search would indeed work here.
<blockquote>[b]Question 2[/b]
<p>To make the game more interesting different types of floor have been added to the map that<br>
allow the player to move at different speeds across them. Also it has been seen that calling<br>
simpleroute every update slows the game down a lot. It would be much faster if the whole<br>
route were sent all at once when a new destination is created. The new speedroute function<br>
takes a speed map of the whole level and returns a list of the positions through which the<br>
player will move that will reach the destination in the fastest time possible.<br>
Write the following function:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Parameters:</span></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>An array of arbitrary size in which a value of zero denotes a solid wall and the numbers 1 to 10 denote how easy a section of floor is to cross. E.g. map squares with a value of 6 can be traversed at twice the speed of squares with a value of 3. Assume that the map is rectangular and not larger than 128 by 128.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Return:</span></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>An list of positions of the form x0, y0, x1, y1, x2, y2, …, xn, yn where x0, y0 is the first step in the whole route going through to xn, yn which will be the destination. If no route can be found route should be returned as null.</p>
<p><code>static int[] speedroute( int speedmap[][] , int cx , int cy , int dx , int dy )
{
    int route[] = null;
    //Your Code Here
    return route;
}</code></p>
</blockquote><br>
The second problem is just a single-pair shortest path problem over a weighted graph… the weight would just needs to be inversely proportional to speed, and then an algorithm like A* will work fine.
<blockquote>[b]Question 3[/b]
<p>The game is being changed to include gates that open and close at regular intervals. The character should be able to get to the destination in the shortest time using the gates within the map. Each gate starts off open and will close after x updates then reopen x updates later. Gates close and open after the character moves each call of updates. The character must never end up on a gate as it closes. Write the following function:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Parameters:</span></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>An array of arbitrary size where -1 denotes and empty area, 0 denotes a solid wall and values of 1 and higher denote the value of x in the above description of the gates. Assume that the map is rectangular and not larger than 128 by 128.</p>
<p><code>static int[] temporalroute( int timemap[][] , int cx , int cy , int dx , int dy )
{
    int route[] = null;
    //Your Code Here
    return route;
}</code></p>
</blockquote><br>
For the third, I imagine this is isn’t the best way to solve the problem, but you could lazily construct a decision tree that is augmented with the state of gates and do a deepening graph search until the goal state is reached… I figured something like how to solve bloxors. What do you think?
