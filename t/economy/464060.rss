    <description>Tell me what you think of this idea:

For the economy, I wouldn&#39;t include any starter in the beginning, only basic items in the shops, meaning the essentials such as: Armor and weapons up to Mithril/Willow/Basic Robes (Forgot name), and the standard general store items. In order to get higher items, the player must A) Try to get it as a drop, with the rates being rather high, or B) Make it using their skills. So essentially, the players would be feeding the servers economy. Now, lets say at one point many players were getting many rare items due to luck with drops, and then those players all quit, giving away their items, and eventually having a lower player count, and a high amount of cash flowing through the economy, I would have a counter-measure. This counter-measure would be to lower the global price of that item of course, then make that item seem less desirable somehow, by introducing a new item, maybe a custom, or an unorthodox item, and making it seem desirable. Do you think the players would go with it? Maybe I would have to give the item some bonuses while skilling or something..</description>

You can estimate the price… if you made it like 10m per drop ofc the items are gonna be 10b+, its pretty common sense.<br>
You can see other rsps economies and make judgement calls from their.</p>

<p>in all seriousness… i’m sure by adopting the ultima model of gameplay somewhat in an rs server (woot experimentation) you could actually make contracts a metagame idea and players enforce them in a full pvp world!! if i make a forum request to you to get me shitloads of shit and i pay up front, if you don’t deliver on my contract i can then basically enforce my will and hire people to kill you and rob your bank (&lt;-- new game mechanic anyone? 99 thieving may just get useful…) until i get what i want back. or i could just get them to kill you repeatedly as punishment. or i could write up a player-imprisonment mechanic where players can imprison others, that would be cool although very susceptible to high-level pkers going insane and imprisoning everyone… make it costly i guess</p>

<p>Basically yes. This might require some client-side interface changes to be made (new sidebar interface for contracts available to the player, contracts in progress, completed contracts, etc) for it to be a concise functionality.</p>
<p>There’s loads of different ways that you can augment an economy, but the most effective one would be something similar to the Grand Exchange, where people are able to set their own prices. Giving people options is what makes/breaks an economy.</p>
<p>And as said earlier, an items “true value” is also taken into consideration. You don’t have to have party hats, or santa hats as rare items. You could sell them in the general store as gifts for 10 GP if you wanted. The reason they’re rare in RuneScape, is because they were only given out one year, at the very beginning, and a large span of time has passed since then, making the net amount available very little. If you had trimmed armor as a 1% chance in a treasure trail/difficult boss, then it would be more rare than party hats, and thus more valuable. The same applies to gilded armor, or anything you want.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Contract system? Explain.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I got the idea from EVE Online. It wont replace an economy (nor should it), but it provides a buffer between the price of an item, and the amount of effort needed to get it. I’ll try to explain it the best I can.</p>
<p>A player can issue a contract, which entails either buying or selling a certain amount of given items. So I could create a contract, in which a person, or a group of people, mine for me 10k rune ess. Each contract would have an expiration time, by which the contract must be completed. If someone has accepted the contract, and the expiration time is near, they could either request an extension from the issuer, or pay the collateral for not completing the contract in time. After a contract has been successfully completed, the person who accepted the contract would receive the reward.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Contract:
Issuer: zyle1992
Expiration: 11/23/2012 17:00
Requirements:
    Rune Ess: 10,000
    Air Runes: 1,000

Collateral:
    Coins: 50,000

Reward:
    Coins: 1,250,000</code></pre>
<p>After a player sees the contract, they can either accept it then, and get to work, or accept and complete the contract if they already have the required items, or contact the issuer, and negotiate a different deal.</p>
<p>This would work best in addition to an Exchange type system, as it provides the players with more control</p>
<p>EDIT: I should also note that it would be wise to “reserve” the detailed items. Let’s say a person drafts a contract, with a 22m coin reward. If they don’t have the 22m as a reward, they should not be able to create the contract. Likewise, if they have 22m, create the contract, they shouldn’t be permitted to have less than that amount at any time (killed, trade it, buy other items, or anything else that brings them below 22m). Or you can just have the items removed at the time of creation so exploiting it doesn’t become possible.</p>
<p>Another idea is to have contracts, or mini-quests given by random Npcs. Let’s say there’s some guy in Lumbridge, the player talks to him, finds out that some goblins in the abandoned house took something from him, and he’ll pay coins/items to get it back. Or the guards of the local city can hire you to kill goblins/black wizards/* and will pay you for it.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Ruby, post:6, topic:464060”]The only sure fire way to control an economy is to have some form of a grand exchange and have it write to a chart. That way what there’s more of in the game you can up the price and when there’s less you can lower the price.[/quote]that’s the most boring proposition for an economy i have <span class="bbcode-b">ever</span> heard. why not implement a way for you to control the supply of resources instead, so you have a modifiable multiplier for things like rare drop rates, ore respawn times, tree respawn times, monster respawn times blahblah. rather than your boring control everything!!! crap you can fiddle with the multipliers and notice what happens to your server economy. when you lower the spawn time for certain boss monsters and the rare drop rate, you’ll see a sure fire increase in the price of a drop (especially if it’s really fucking useful). natural resources e.g. food, ore and wood would be fun to manipulate too (it’s a shame that weapons don’t decay over time though).</p>
