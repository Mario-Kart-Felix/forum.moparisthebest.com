    <description>Alright I am currently coding my own Fight Pits from scratch.
Everything works perfectly so far, but the only problem is that I do not know how to get the amount of players within the waiting room or game.

I forgot to mention that this server is Project 16 v6

Example:

This is what is in my PlayerHandler
[code]public static int PlayersInPitsRoom = 0;[/code]

Tried these with client
[code]if(isInPitsRoom) {
PlayerHandler.PlayersInPitsRoom += 1;
}[/code]

Also

[code]if(isInPitsRoom) {
PlayerHandler.PlayersInPitsRoom++;
}[/code]

0 errors with these


Those cause it to add up as in like a timer, how could I make it so that it is the amount of players inside that room?  Yes I do have the area of the room defined &quot;isInPitsRoom&quot;

Thanks,

              <p>Why not make it easy on yourself and make the “vent” add it, find where your object clicking is for the vents to get into pit. Then add your += 1 for playercount to that, Then when the game starts set it back to 0. Then when anyone dies in pits add back to counter and then add the winner. that way you dont have to screw around with areas.</p>
