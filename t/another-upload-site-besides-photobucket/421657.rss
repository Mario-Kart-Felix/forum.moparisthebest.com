    <title>Another upload site besides Photobucket</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/another-upload-site-besides-photobucket/421657</link>
    <description>Ok you can use tinypic and all that but there is a website that i found that my mate showed me. It&#39;s simple and easy to use.

Go to [url=http://filesmelt.com/]http://filesmelt.com/[/url] and click on simple

Once you are on Simple click the inside the white box. That allows you to upload the pictures or files you want. Once you have done that click on upload and the links will be there. They are Direct links so you can just C&amp;P to your topics.

Again You could use Tinypic for pictures and videos but I prefer filesmelt because you can upload videos files server files pictures anything really. I don&#39;t think that there is a upload limit either which is good.

I hope this has helped you with uploading files videos etc.

[size=21pt]Note: If this is in the wrong section then please can a moderator move it to the correct section[/size]

Thanks for reading and see you guys soon

              <p>For me ImageShack is the best. No captcha, multiple upload is available. If you are using their tool and upping multiple photos at the end you get a whole list with direct links which makes it really easy to post a pack on forums.</p>

Please don’t try to troll on me please. I am trying to help people where else to go besides photobucket or imageshack or tinypic, not for dicks like you trying to troll on people.</p>
<p>Also it’s a moderators job to move topics if it’s in the wrong section. That’s their job, not ours. (That is not to offend any moderators on the forums. I know you hacve a busty job and we need to do thingsd our selves you it’s also your job to make sure that all posts are in the correct section)</p>

<p>And I love imageshack, but lots of people complain they are slow (not for me though).</p>
<p>Both imgur and imageshack have tools to download, so that you can right click your files and upload them. So you don’t need to visit the site and browse for the pictures etc.</p>

              <p>Ok you can use tinypic and all that but there is a website that i found that my mate showed me. It’s simple and easy to use.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="http://filesmelt.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://filesmelt.com/</a> and click on simple</p>
<p>Once you are on Simple click the inside the white box. That allows you to upload the pictures or files you want. Once you have done that click on upload and the links will be there. They are Direct links so you can just C&amp;P to your topics.</p>
<p>Again You could use Tinypic for pictures and videos but I prefer filesmelt because you can upload videos files server files pictures anything really. I don’t think that there is a upload limit either which is good.</p>
<p>I hope this has helped you with uploading files videos etc.</p>
