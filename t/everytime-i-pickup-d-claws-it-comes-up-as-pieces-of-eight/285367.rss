    <description>i have just downloaded chris-scape v1. Its is a 317 type of server. Since i had trouble using i client i use client.silabsoft.org. when i log in is says to do ::dclaws for d claws. so i do it. instead it gives me pieces of eight. so i go an check in the items.cfg and i find the code for dragon claws, i go back into the game and i do ::pickup (code for drag claws) (quantity) and it still gives me pieces of eight. If anyone could tell me how to solve this problem it would be great!</description>

              <p>D claws, and many other new rs items don’t work on silab. You NEED to download a different client if you want to see them/use them.</p>

<p>Wrong section, hit the models section.</p>

<p>You either have the wrong ints, or models. If you have the models, put .rar(or 7zip) files into the models folder for your client.</p>

<p>Try it.</p>

              <p>If you do ::dclaws and comes up as a “eight” either, you don’t have the items model added into the client, or you add the wrong id.</p>
