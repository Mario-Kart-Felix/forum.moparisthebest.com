    <title>The Scientific End of the World (As defined by my Science teacher)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-scientific-end-of-the-world-as-defined-by-my-science-teacher/149173</link>
    <description>I really like science this year, our teacher seems very knowledgeable. I&#39;d say he&#39;s in his late fifties, early sixties, he used to live in Hawaii, and he&#39;s Polish. Anyway on with the topic.

He talks about Pangaea II, the Earth&#39;s inner core, and the Sun&#39;s burnout.

In case you don&#39;t know what Pangaea is, before all of the continents were separate, it&#39;s believed that they were all connected in some kind of super continent * Dr. Evil Air Quotes &quot;Pangaea&quot;
We&#39;ve all broken apart and we&#39;re moving towards  * Dr. Evil Air Quotes &quot;Pangaea Two&quot;
Once the Earth&#39;s inner core has cooled to much, the continental drift will stop.

At this point, Earth will rely on the external power source, * Dr. Evil Air Quotes &quot;The Sun&quot;
Of course everyone here at MITB will be long gone, excluding me because of my * Dr. Evil Air Quotes &quot;Time Machine&quot;
Anyhow, eventually the Sun will burn out, and the Earth will become part of the Sun&#39;s surface. This is what I&#39;d like to call 
* Dr. Evil Air Quotes &quot;Epically Fucked&quot;

This galaxy will become a quasar and thats it, the end of Earth.

So stop being a pussy and go live your life, we don&#39;t have for ever (Just about five billion years)

Oh ya, he also talked about how the mass extinction of humans will come way before this, probably by a meteor.</description>

              <p>Hmm, I’ve been [attempting] to read up on some of the more major parts of M-Theory and as far as I know we shouldn’t be able to go to other solar systems within a plausible amount of time and expect our bodies to stay anywhere near aliveness.</p>
<p>However, multi-dimensionally, it doesn’t seem too hard (given approx. 300 years) to find a way to travel back in time and start from a time when the Earth was stable and then we could use our technology and learn from our mistakes to create a better environment.</p>
<p>Just to unconfuse some people on why we then wouldn’t stop existing and create a paradox, I’ll try to explain this:</p>
<ul>
<li>From any given point in space-time (on the 4th dimension or lower), there are an infinite amount of possibilities to be had, all of which will be taken on an infinite number of universes.</li>
<li>If we went back in time, that point of time would be altered and we’d then be creating a new timeline which would follow after, the timeline from whence we came would still remain on another universe.</li>
<li>This is kinda going off one of the member’s threads in SRL, but it sounds like as you approach the speed of light, you gain mass (hence why light has mass but not weight), if someone were to go faster than the speed of light, they’d either weigh an infinite amount (similar to a black hole) or just weigh a few million kilograms, either way, you’d still implode. So basically, we’re screwed in the way of space travel (wormholes, anyone?)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all way beyond my current education, so please, someone contradict me <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>I honestly think that there is a good posibility for nuclear warfare. However i think the governments realize that if they do launch a nuclear missle and cause nuclear war there would be no point. If you destroy the world you will get absolutely nothing done. Its like saying hmm i want to go take over that country. (starts a war) hmm we are losing i know lets nuke the fuck out of it so we cant do anything with it for the next 100 years.

<p>Nuclear war would accomplish nothing if it was to happen.</p>

There where 4 planes, 2 of them in the wtc, one of it in the pentagon and of it crashed close to Shanksvill. They where comercial planes. Some people called their familiy, while being in the plane. That’s why we know there are 4-5 hijackers each plane.<br>
Don’t you think it would be a bit strange if none of the airflight companys missed a plane?<br>
You also forgot that Bush had the power to attack Iran / Afghanistan, even without 9/11.</p>
<p>People like you just watch to much movies and never face reality.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes he does have the power to attack Iran / Afghanistan. But for no reason?<br>
Thats the problem, people get too powerful, we are our own destruction and no one realizes it. This is like a halocaust in the making but instead on one race, the entire world as we know it.<br>
I seriously wish places like Iraq, U.S.A., and north korea had sensible leaders. Although i hate her, Opera Winfry (SP) would seem like a great leader at the moment. It’s all about greed really, material possesions, looks and money mean a lot in this world today. So people raid poor countries for their oil and natural rescources. As for Bush causing 9/11, there is no proof but it isn’t impossible.</p>

No, im not refering to the “Christian” god, im muslim, i really only believe in one god, which in my mind can be anyones god, i don’t like to belive that the christian god, the muslim god are different. Im not scared of death, truely. If i get a disease that will kill me painlessly in a second, so be it. I believe in the afterlife and so I don’t think of dieing as rotting in the ground and “once existing”.<br>
I fear god not forgiving me for the stuff I do (yes, i am scared of spiders n shit, buts thats different) i fear going to hell, not dieing.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>So then why do you think God will kill the sinners?  He will just damn them to hell, not to death.[/quote]</p>
<p>I must be crazy, but i belive selfishness (if ur a christian which im not) is a sin. like you said, if i wasn’t selfish i would realize death isn’t bad (which i do).<br>
Anyways, i belive that the judgement begins once you die. Basically, if your good, and you die, you go to heaven.<br>
If you sin, and you die, you go to hell.<br>
Thats what i meant, they still do go to hell, i just didn’t mention that.</p>

I belive in god, i also believe that some day he might come and kill all the sinners.</p>
<p>But, i belive we as human being will beat him too it, with global warming, or we just kill each other, because we can’t get along and we insist on fighting.<br>

<p>If it is the Christian God you are referring to, you are pretty wrong.  If you stop being so selfish, you would realize that death isn’t the worst thing that could happen to you.  Eternal separation from God and a life in Hell is to be feared, not death.[/quote]</p>

<p>If it is the Christian God you are referring to, you are pretty wrong.  If you stop being so selfish, you would realize that death isn’t the worst thing that could happen to you.  Eternal separation from God and a life in Hell is to be feared, not death.</p>

Blah people irritate me. They make us ’ Conspiracy Believers ', ( I would rather not be labeled, or Classified.), look bad? They didn’t do their research.</p>
<p>One, They weren’t Government planes. Nor did they ‘Shoot at the towers’. It’s called Thermite.<br>

<p>Some people were right though. How could a tower withstand powers of earthquakes, high speed winds, and much more. But not withstand a plane?</p>
<p>‘Oh, but Divine! The news says Terrorist flew planes into the WTC’s, and the Pentagon!’<br>
K, You’re living with a blindfold on your eyes, for you are hidden from the truth.</p>
<p>Now, Back from the last part, Let’s see, The WTC’s , were hit, and only stood up, for, around 102 minutes[If I’m right].</p>
<p>Take a look back in time. Some buildings, were on fire, [Waayyy older then the WTC’s], and lasted 48 hours? But no, Some how, on 9/11 the towers couldn’t withstand open fires.</p>
<p>Also, For some of you out there. Still believing the Mass Media, [As always]. You should know how we had, Vital proof, that ‘Terrorist’, did the job, right?</p>
<p>A passport was found, after the first tower was hit. So, you’re telling me, that A passport flew out of the plane, threw all those flames, and wasn’t even burned? Wow, wtf, lots of laws of physics were defied on 9/11.</p>
<p>'Divine,Divine,Divine, you sad newb, Peoples calls there families on the planes, and were like ‘omgs! we’s r beings attackeds’</p>
<p>K, Let’s see, We have recordings of this, correct?<br>
In those recordings, They seem, to repeat them selves? And such?</p>
<p>I would like to say a lot more. Plus, I’m super tired, And don’t feel like going through this.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>No, there is no conspiracy.  You’re just a weak-minded individual who uses one biased source and claims it is research.[/quote]</p>
<p>And I’m going to be the one laughing at you, when, were carrying around RFID chips, and, when you still believe the government as your god.</p>

              <p>[quote=".Flair, post:1, topic:149173"]I really like science this year, our teacher seems very knowledgeable. I’d say he’s in his late fifties, early sixties, he used to live in Hawaii, and he’s Polish. Anyway on with the topic.</p>
<p>He talks about Pangaea II, the Earth’s inner core, and the Sun’s burnout.</p>
<p>In case you don’t know what Pangaea is, before all of the continents were separate, it’s believed that they were all connected in some kind of super continent * Dr. Evil Air Quotes “Pangaea”<br>
We’ve all broken apart and we’re moving towards  * Dr. Evil Air Quotes “Pangaea Two”<br>
Once the Earth’s inner core has cooled to much, the continental drift will stop.</p>
<p>At this point, Earth will rely on the external power source, * Dr. Evil Air Quotes “The Sun”<br>
Of course everyone here at MITB will be long gone, excluding me because of my * Dr. Evil Air Quotes “Time Machine”<br>
Anyhow, eventually the Sun will burn out, and the Earth will become part of the Sun’s surface. This is what I’d like to call</p>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Evil Air Quotes “Epically Fucked”</li>
</ul>
<p>This galaxy will become a quasar and thats it, the end of Earth.</p>
<p>So stop being a pussy and go live your life, we don’t have for ever (Just about five billion years)</p>
<p>Oh ya, he also talked about how the mass extinction of humans will come way before this, probably by a meteor.[/quote]</p>
<p>Didn’t bother to read if anyone had said this yet, but Pangaea wasn’t the first super-continent. The continents have been moving as long as Earth has been around. There have been a few super continents created, ripped apart, recreated before the Earth got to how it looks today. And a super continent formation is believed to be a reason for a part of the mass extinction of dinosaurs. The land mass was so big, that the inner most parts of the land were so far from sea, that the summers were VERY hot and dry, and the winters were extremely freezing. As the continents are constantly moving, and the super-continent formation, and destruction will happen a lot more times in the future, it is near impossible to say that humans will survive.</p>
<p>However, in my pov, I believe that humans would have been off Earth for millions of years. Seeing how technology has evolved over the past 200 years, you cannot deny that in the next 1000 or so years, presuming the Earth hasn’t exploded (by nuclear weapons, or 21/12/2012), technology will greatly advance, and the length of time there is a human presence on this Earth is numbered.</p>
<p>tl;dr:<br>
Humans will either be dead, or left this planet before all this happens.</p>
