        <p>[quote=".Flair, post:1, topic:149173"]I really like science this year, our teacher seems very knowledgeable. I’d say he’s in his late fifties, early sixties, he used to live in Hawaii, and he’s Polish. Anyway on with the topic.</p>
<p>He talks about Pangaea II, the Earth’s inner core, and the Sun’s burnout.</p>
<p>In case you don’t know what Pangaea is, before all of the continents were separate, it’s believed that they were all connected in some kind of super continent * Dr. Evil Air Quotes “Pangaea”<br>
We’ve all broken apart and we’re moving towards  * Dr. Evil Air Quotes “Pangaea Two”<br>
Once the Earth’s inner core has cooled to much, the continental drift will stop.</p>
<p>At this point, Earth will rely on the external power source, * Dr. Evil Air Quotes “The Sun”<br>
Of course everyone here at MITB will be long gone, excluding me because of my * Dr. Evil Air Quotes “Time Machine”<br>
Anyhow, eventually the Sun will burn out, and the Earth will become part of the Sun’s surface. This is what I’d like to call</p>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Evil Air Quotes “Epically Fucked”</li>
</ul>
<p>This galaxy will become a quasar and thats it, the end of Earth.</p>
<p>So stop being a pussy and go live your life, we don’t have for ever (Just about five billion years)</p>
<p>Oh ya, he also talked about how the mass extinction of humans will come way before this, probably by a meteor.[/quote]</p>
<p>Didn’t bother to read if anyone had said this yet, but Pangaea wasn’t the first super-continent. The continents have been moving as long as Earth has been around. There have been a few super continents created, ripped apart, recreated before the Earth got to how it looks today. And a super continent formation is believed to be a reason for a part of the mass extinction of dinosaurs. The land mass was so big, that the inner most parts of the land were so far from sea, that the summers were VERY hot and dry, and the winters were extremely freezing. As the continents are constantly moving, and the super-continent formation, and destruction will happen a lot more times in the future, it is near impossible to say that humans will survive.</p>
<p>However, in my pov, I believe that humans would have been off Earth for millions of years. Seeing how technology has evolved over the past 200 years, you cannot deny that in the next 1000 or so years, presuming the Earth hasn’t exploded (by nuclear weapons, or 21/12/2012), technology will greatly advance, and the length of time there is a human presence on this Earth is numbered.</p>
<p>tl;dr:<br>
Humans will either be dead, or left this planet before all this happens.</p>

<p>Oh, believe me, I don’t believe my government is my god.  Far from it.  Bush and Cheney should definitely be impeached.  But that doesn’t mean they caused 9-11.  It was a stroke of luck for Bush.  And if I was Bush, and I was planning on invading Iraq, I would have set something up that would have been actually traceable to Iraq.</p>

<p>No, im not refering to the “Christian” god, im muslim, i really only believe in one god, which in my mind can be anyones god, i don’t like to belive that the christian god, the muslim god are different. Im not scared of death, truely. If i get a disease that will kill me painlessly in a second, so be it. I believe in the afterlife and so I don’t think of dieing as rotting in the ground and “once existing”.<br>
I fear god not forgiving me for the stuff I do (yes, i am scared of spiders n shit, buts thats different) i fear going to hell, not dieing.</p>

<p>I must be crazy, but i belive selfishness (if ur a christian which im not) is a sin. like you said, if i wasn’t selfish i would realize death isn’t bad (which i do).<br>
Anyways, i belive that the judgement begins once you die. Basically, if your good, and you die, you go to heaven.<br>
If you sin, and you die, you go to hell.<br>
Thats what i meant, they still do go to hell, i just didn’t mention that.</p>

<p>You’re right… Our U.S. governement is gay and is eventually going to be getting us all killed. Mainly by nuclear war. If that doesen’t kill us, then the sun is, maybe global warming.------It’s a race, which world-wide problem will kill us first??-----</p>

        <p>[quote=“qauters, post:25, topic:149173”]Another conspiracy believer -.-, you guys don’t have any sense of reality. There where 4 planes, 2 of them in the wtc, one of it in the pentagon and of it crashed close to Shanksvill. They where comercial planes. Some people called their familiy, while being in the plane. That’s why we know there are 4-5 hijackers each plane.<br>
Don’t you think it would be a bit strange if none of the airflight companys missed a plane?<br>
You also forgot that Bush had the power to attack Iran / Afghanistan, even without 9/11.</p>
<p>People like you just watch to much movies and never face reality.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes he does have the power to attack Iran / Afghanistan. But for no reason?<br>
Thats the problem, people get too powerful, we are our own destruction and no one realizes it. This is like a halocaust in the making but instead on one race, the entire world as we know it.<br>
I seriously wish places like Iraq, U.S.A., and north korea had sensible leaders. Although i hate her, Opera Winfry (SP) would seem like a great leader at the moment. It’s all about greed really, material possesions, looks and money mean a lot in this world today. So people raid poor countries for their oil and natural rescources. As for Bush causing 9/11, there is no proof but it isn’t impossible.</p>

        <p>I honestly think that there is a good posibility for nuclear warfare. However i think the governments realize that if they do launch a nuclear missle and cause nuclear war there would be no point. If you destroy the world you will get absolutely nothing done. Its like saying hmm i want to go take over that country. (starts a war) hmm we are losing i know lets nuke the fuck out of it so we cant do anything with it for the next 100 years. (because of radiation)</p>
<p>Nuclear war would accomplish nothing if it was to happen.</p>
<p>I think there is a lesser possibility of a meteor hitting but it still might hit.</p>
