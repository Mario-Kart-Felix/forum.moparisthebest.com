    <title>[DODIAN]Mining as fast as woodcutting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dodian-mining-as-fast-as-woodcutting/236207</link>
    <description>Hey .. I was wondering if anyone can help me with this . .Im using Devo 7.0 .. And Woodcutting is more or less extremely fast and doesnt stop woodcutting everytime it says &#39; You get a log &#39;

Where-as Mining goes really slow and stops everytime it says &#39; You get an ore&#39;

Can anybody help me making mining as fast as woodcutting? Thanks :)</description>

</aside>
<p>That’s kind of how mining is supposed to be…</p>
<p>Anyways, like I said, take the woodcutting codes from that tutorial that I pointed you to, and convert the codes, so it works for mining instead, I’m pretty sure that tutorial has the repeating emote and you keep getting the logs, so it should work for mining too.</p>
