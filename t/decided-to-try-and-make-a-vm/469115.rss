    <title>Decided to try and make a VM</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/decided-to-try-and-make-a-vm/469115</link>
    <description>Really, realy, really basic stuff for the moment.
I&#39;m trying to learn about how a computer works internally so this is some preparation to the actual project.
The language will look alot like Assembly but it&#39;s really just a wannabe remake. It generally has the same flow and looks but
some small aspects will be different.

Inspired by the 0x10c project by Notch.

Specifications;
[code]Cin Virtual Machine
* 16 bit words
* Standard signedness will be used for signed types. (Most significant bit shall be used to indicate the state)
* 1 million words of RAM.
* Internal registers; R (Residu/Excess), O (Overflow), U (Underflow), PC (Program Counter), SP (Stack Pointer), E (Error)
* Public acces registers; X, Y, Z
* Hardware related registers will be added in a later version.
* Alot of the original Assembly registers are left out. Cin will try to function without them, thus allowing
	more flexible ways around common problems.

Instructions are defined by 1 single 16-bit word.
This word is split up in either 3 or 2 words depending on the opcode.
The opcode is the highest 5 bits of the word.
OOOOOOxxxxxxxxxx
The remaining x bits are either 1 word as a whole or split up in 2 words
OOOOOOaaaaabbbbb

INSTRUCTION SET FOR 3 WORDS; O, a and b
0	SET -&gt; set a to b
1	ADD -&gt; set a to a+b
2	SUB -&gt; set a to a-b
3	MUL -&gt; set a to a*b
4	DIV -&gt; set a to a/b, set R to the remainder of the division
LOGICAL OPERATIONS
5	IFE -&gt; run next operation only if a==b
6	IFN -&gt; run next operation only if a!=b
7	IFG -&gt; run next operation only if a&gt;b
8	IFL -&gt; run next operation only if a&lt;b
9	IGE -&gt; run next operation only if a&gt;=b
10	ILE -&gt; run next operation only if a&lt;=b
BITWISE OPERATIONS
11	AND -&gt; Bitwise &#39;and&#39;.
12	BOR -&gt; Bitwise &#39;or&#39;.
13	XOR -&gt; Bitwise inverted or.
14	BSR -&gt; Shift a to the right by b amount of bits. Any bits thrown off the word are stored in R.
15	BSL -&gt; Shift a to the left by b amount of bits. Any bits thrown off the word are stored in R.

INSTRUCTION SET FOR 2 WORDS; O and a
0	JMP -&gt; Jump to a, push PC to the stack
1	POP -&gt; Reads the value on top of the stack
2	PSH -&gt; Pushes a to the stack.
3	REM -&gt; Removes the value at [SP] on the stack. Usefull for removing data on the stack that relates 
			to a closed program.

SYNTAX
	SET [0] |1| -&gt; sets the memory cell 0 to the value 1.
	SET PC |1| -&gt; sets the PC register to 1.
	SET PC [1] -&gt; sets PC to the value stored in the memory cell 1.
	SET [PC] |1| -&gt; exactly the same thing, there&#39;s no need to define the value of a register.

	[i] -&gt; value at memory cell i;
	|i| -&gt; the literal value i;
	i -&gt; will thrown an error and halt the system.
	You can&#39;t define a value simply by it&#39;s identifier. This is only possible for registers.

	For now, only the SET instruction can asign a literal value to a memory cell.
	In order to use the other operations you asign 2 values to 2 different memory cells and then
	use those 2 memory cells in the operation you want.
	For example;
	SET [0] |1|
	SET [1] |3|
	ADD [1] [0]
	[1] is now 4.
	
FLOW CONTROL
	The generic labels are used throughout the programs.
	Use JMP &lt;target&gt; to jump to that context.
	Using JMP also pushes the current PC to the stack.
	This offers for an easy return to the original context;
	SET PC POP
	or
	JMP POP
	The thing with that last example is that it will push the PC to the stack once more.
	Hence why when returning from a label to the original context, we will use the first example.
	A label redirects to the following operation. This allows labels to be represented as numbers
	and as such, they can be added/removed from the stack.
	[/code]

Constructive criticism will be accepted, offences shall be ignored.</description>

<p>You usually have something indicating the starting address of the stack in your code, then the different between SP and that is the size of your stack.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly the cpu I’ve worked with in ASM allowed you to initialize the base address like so:</p>

<p>It surely would be but I really don’t know why I want 16-bit. I know it has nothing to do with the whole DCPU thing but I do feel like a 32 bit or 64 bit would be even easier to make than a 16 bit vm xD<br>
I really feel like I’ve abandoned this project… I’ve made plans for networking and hardware connections though xD Had an exam period last 2 weeks so I’m slowly getting back to this xD</p>

You should change the JMP op-code. Make it NOT push PC in the stack. Rather have an extra CALL OP-code for the purpose you are seeking.[/quote]</p>
<p>To jump to a target without pushing the PC to the stack you’d do:<br>
SET PC <br>
JMP pushes PC to the stack to allow a simple return feature;<br>

You should change the JMP op-code. Make it NOT push PC in the stack. Rather have an extra CALL OP-code for the purpose you are seeking.</p>

              <p>Sorry for the long halt but I just have to say that I seriously underestimated the amount of work that is put into the development of a VM. Firstly, I forgot to specify how many turns an instuction takes on the clock (cpu). Second, I can’t get a good instruction set in only 16 bits. I know I can just increase word size but I rather keep it compact.</p>
<p>Despite the practical failure, I learned alot more about things like signed data representation, the stack itself, control flow, etc…<br>
I know alot more now and I think I can finish the project but it’s going to be for another time xD</p>

So you can properly add/subtract/multiply any 16-bit number. You need however a subrutine and a system to support multiword numbers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cres: I think you have misunderstood the use of a stack.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I know what it is, I just can’t figure out a way to implement it.<br>
A stack is basically a heap of memory that consists of data that is being used by functions in active programs.<br>
When you ‘push’ a value onto the stack, the SP increases or decreases (depending on how you build your stack) by 1. The SP will constantly point to the latest value ‘pushed’ onto the stack.<br>
When you read from a stack or ‘pop’ a value from the stack, you retrieve the value the SP is pointing and then increase/decrease the SP by 1 (opposite of the previous).</p>
<p>I just can’t make up if the stack is an actual part of the memory or a seperate block of memory. I also don’t know if there’s just 1 stack or if there’s a stack for each individual program/function.<br>
If a stack is an actual part of the memory; does it start at the bottom or at the top?<br>
That’s my main concern but for the rest, I’m pretty sure of what I’m doing xD</p>
<p>Also, about the registers, I won’t follow Assembly standards. As I stated in the OP; the E register will handle any errors. Errors can be anything that could interrupt the whole system such as an overflow, underflow, unknown instruction, inavailable index, etc…<br>
The language’s behaviour is still open for debate; an instruction asigning a value to E internally could either be ignored or cause the whole program to halt and prompt out what went or could have went wrong.</p>
<p>In general lines, my wannabe language will try to copy Assembly’s behaviour allbeit in a slightly different way.</p>
<p>About registers and overflows and other types of errors;<br>
The instruction will be simulated aforehand and only in a number of situation will E be set to a value.</p>
<ul>
<li>Overflow - a bigger value thn what the system supports.</li>
<li>Underflow - Since I’ll be using unsigned values, any instruction that asign a value under 0 will set E to this errorcode.<br>
When the simulation is done; E will be set (or not set at all if the instruction is valid) to the proper errorcode.<br>
After the simulation, the instruction will be executed. If E is set to any value besides 0 (0 will stand for no errors at all) then the instruction will continue.<br>
If E is set to any other value, the instruction will either be ignored or the whole program will halt. (this depends on the nature of the instruction).</li>
</ul>
