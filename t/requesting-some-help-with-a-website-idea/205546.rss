    <description>Not sure if script requests are alloweds in this section, but anyways I am looking for someone to help me on my site.

I have absolutely no knowledge of PHP, and to be honest I have no intention to learn any. This is probably a lot to ask for, but it&#39;s still a reletively small project. All I need from this is a very basic working php script of this, and the rest I will take care of (implementing it into a web design, etc). Here is what I am working on:

I am essentially creating a http://www.pillreports.com/ clone, but for LSD rather than ecstasy. There is a lack of high quality LSD/acid these days, and you never know anything other than what the dealer tells you. Basically this website will allow users to register an account (use mysql please), and write reports about the acid they have done. When posting a report, there will be a form requesting information of several things.

First it will ask for the logo of the acid. Incase you don&#39;t understand what I mean, an acid hit is usually a SMALL piece of paper with a picture on it (see: http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/images/archive/lsd_collage2.jpg) So for instance, if your blotter had a picture of a lion, than you would enter &quot;lion&quot;. It will than ask for the location, so they might choose to enter a city, or a state/province. It will than ask for the quality of the acid, where they can choose from a few options such as &quot;Not active&quot; &quot;Poor&quot; &quot;Good&quot; etc. It will than ask for a picture of the acid and you can upload it to the site. The final thing it asks for is a general trip report, where they can describe how many hits they did, what the visuals were like, how high they got, how awesome it was, how shitty it was, etc. After they submit a report, it is posted instantly.

Now the other main thing that users need to be able to do is search for reports. No registration is required for this. Lets say there are magic school bus blotters in town, and before buying them I want to see how good they are and what people in my area had to say about them. Basically I need a search engine on the site with the following search fields(also they are optional to search for):
-The logo (So I would type in magic school bus)
-The location (so I might type in Ottawa)
And a check box for &quot;Only show reports with pictures&quot;
Also the search engine needs to be fairly forgiving. If someone posted a report of &quot;lions&quot; and i searched for &quot;lion,&quot; lions should still come up as a result. 

So I need all this^^.. I have a feeling it&#39;s too much to ask for, but I am not in a position to pay money right now and I really want to get this site going. I need it to be secure so that you cant just type in malicious stuff into the search box etc. Reply here, pm me, or find me on IRC if you&#39;d like to help.*cough sppt plz*. And like I said, I just need a basic functioning version of this. No web design is required or anything like that.</description>

<p>What you’re requesting doesn’t deal with a great deal of PHP experience. If I were you, I’d just learn how to do some basic MySQL connecting, learning how to use forms, and inserting database information. The search function is not hard either, but having a search function open to the public, depending on how many hits you get, can slow you up a bit.</p>

</aside>
<p>I am aware about the search issue. I will do something about it if it becomes a problem. For now I just want the site.</p>
<p>It seems like none of you guys are ever on aim? [quote=“ThatOneServer, post:6, topic:205546”][quote author=jme link=topic=271221.msg2229853#msg2229853 date=1211077208]<br>
I added both of you. ThatOneServer, I didn’t even know how to add an email though so I put it as both the screen name and email? I don’t know, no one uses aim here so I dont have a clue how it works lol. If RXVL is still willing to do this I’ll get him to help me just cuz I’ve known him for a long time etc.<br>

just put the screen name as the email.</p>

<p>I’d really rather just have a very basic plain version. All just plain text and whatnot. I can go from there I’m sure.</p>
