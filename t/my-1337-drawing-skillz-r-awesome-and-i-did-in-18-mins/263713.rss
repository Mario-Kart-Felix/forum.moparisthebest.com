I always challenge myself with drawings, the girl took about 5 mins while the background took about 10 mins since I detailed it a little with basic lines, no shading XD; all cross hatching.</description>

Is drawing a skill you could learn? Or is it like maths where people are naturally good at it?<br>
[/quote]<br>
You can learn to express yourself in many ways, I guess drawing is one of them. However I think some people are naturally better at drawing representations of stuff. Not all art is representational though.[/quote]<br>
Well, im not going to brag here, but i caught onto drawing very fast. My mom and teachers always said for my age i was very good. You can make things look nice, but classes teach you about proportional drawing and how to keep things balanced. And different techniques that you may like. But yes, drawing can be learned. I think some people are born to enjoy it, therefore they try harder with everything they make. To others its like doodling, which in their eyes is a waste of time.</p>
<p>I enjoy drawing, i hate painting, coloring, pastels and sculptures. So drawing is my main focus.</p>
