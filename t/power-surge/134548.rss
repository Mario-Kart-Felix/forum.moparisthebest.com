              <p>I enjoy the final one, the trimming is bad, try using the magic select tool (dunno what its called) next time, and perhaps feather it a bit. uhm, the right side needs to be a sinch brighter but i love your left side, its nice.</p>
<p>Overall its a 7/10 due to some flaws, keep trying =)</p>

              <p>[quote=“2142, post:6, topic:134548”]here comes my brutal and honest to god opinion of what i think,<br>
<br>
trim the render, that small white outline doesn’t do it any justice (i know you said you trimmed him bad, but try to do a better job next time). and what’s with the faded white bar at the top right above his head? Draws my attention to it and it kind of ruins the piece in my opinion. Also, your background and render don’t really blend as one. it seems the background was just placed on there, c4d overlay on top of it with lowered opacity. and your render slapped right on it. with WAY more brightness than the background . huge contrast between the render and your background. The guitar almost hurts my eyes looking at it due to its insane brightness and the contrast with the background just makes even more cumbersome to look at. Also, if you look closely at the c4d in the background you can see litle cuts into it (especially right where his text is). A bit annoying in my opinion. Was it intentional or accidental?<br>
And the shapes coming out from the guitar, well, they seem a bit strange. i don’t know how to describe them, but i don’t like them, just as a personal taste.<br>
</p>
<p>EDIT</p>
<p>i’d go with the second, but that still doesn’t much better in my opinion. that new line you added is distracting and deviates from the general flow.[/quote]<br>
question <span class="hashtag">#1</span> who the hell are you?<br>
and thanks for rating, i kind of realised that i messed up on the render <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> and i will improve this sig</p>

<p>2142: I agree in some area’s however i dont find it too overly bright, it does need to be toned down however, and the shapes that are coming out can be found on any ddr game lol (dance dance revolution)</p>
<p>To tell you the truth thats what this reminds me of, a dance dance revolution sig, or perhaps a mix of ddr and guitar hero lol</p>
