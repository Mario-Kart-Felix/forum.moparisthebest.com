              <p>Well, im not 100% sure lol but it looks as if you dont have java on your vps.</p>
<p>make sure you download and install these<br>
<a href="http://www.java.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.java.com</a> - java download<br>
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a> - jdk download links</p>
<p>if you have not done this already its probably your problem. if you have done these im not sure</p>
<p>also once you download jdk make sure if in your run.bat and core if it has anything like this in it, change it to your version of jdk<br>
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_26</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>change the 26 to yoru version</p>
