    <title>The State of the Official Server and Moving Forward</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-state-of-the-official-server-and-moving-forward/553212</link>
    <description>I&#39;m sorry to announce publicly that after today I will no longer be involved with the official server or any serious Runescape emulation projects. I say that with a heavy heart, and I&#39;m grateful to Tom and Davidi2 for the chance and time we spent together trying to create an emulator for the community. I&#39;ve been apart of many projects over the years and I&#39;ve met a lot of great people but I feel as if my time with Runescape emulation has grown beyond that of what can help me grow as a programmer and that I need to move on. Notably I had a great time working on the Moparscape server, both the original and my rendition, PRS06, my creations, and Silabgarza. I wouldn&#39;t be the programmer I am today without this community and I don&#39;t regret the hundreds of hours I spent trying to push the boundaries of emulators or research new topics.

I think this post, as dramatic as it may sound, is speaking to the community. Runescape is growing old, and the excitement that came with trying to discover how Jagex as a company operated at least for me died two years ago with the decline in the games popularity. My passion these past few years were driven by my taste to try and see a rise in the community, and have these adventures once more but I know now that isn&#39;t plausible. 

I was content on working on the server until recently I became involved with a project outside of Runescape emulation. This opportunity opened my eyes to the skills I could possess that are outside of emulation and the choice was simple. I have found that in the past year I have decided I want to get into game development so I can create a similar feeling to how I felt when I first loaded into Runescape about ten years ago with everyone.

I suggest to you that you try not to take this all as serious as some of you may, although taking this seriously is wise, I think everyone is really sensitive about how their image stands among people. I wish I spent more of my time instead of getting offended by how people saw me had more fun, and just enjoyed the ride. It went by fast, six years now I&#39;ve been developing servers since the age of 14 and now looking back I know at least I accomplished much. I had a lot of feuds, I made a lot of friends. Making emulators can lead to skills to land you a job but it&#39;s very limited because of the limitations of creativity you constrain yourself to. I found it hard to advance past the level I reached because I simply didnt understand all the nuances of the game client and the architecture of design.  People still are learning things today, and I think those skills are better applied to creating instead of emulating. There is a lot of talent here, it just needs better focus instead of wasting effort on something that is too niche.

With those remarks, thank you seriously to the following people. Silabsoft for providing a good bounty of information and security testing the server, Tom for helping me get the server to the point it was, Davidi2 for ideas and your dedication to trying to help me move my work forward, Taharok for giving me helpful advice on programming when I needed it, Lothy for bouncing ideas back and forth when we had nothing to do, Zuppers for testing and providing critical information for the server.

To clear up &quot;Well you quit and start something new&quot;, most of that time thats true because the extent of how far I got with any of my projects was at the level where I could have written Runescape in its near entirety. What is there to do beyond that when the market is so diluted? I get very bored when I dont have anything to do and finding a challenge in writing content, or any of the nuances was very short lived. The past few weeks I&#39;ve spent in botting I&#39;ve learned as much as I have over the summer minus the effort I spent working with Runescript (CS2). Which I did, I spent some time the past two weeks scraping data from OSRS. That was a blast. If you have never gotten into hacking on that level, I recommend it.

Anyway, I hope you forgive me if you&#39;re disappointed and what the staff here decide to do I will obviously not be involved in.

Thanks.</description>

<p>And also, as far as RuneScape goes, they should have open-sourced it and given away mod tools a long time ago, and they would have been able to have some measure of success moving into the future. Instead of having a Minecraft level fanbase, Jagex pretty much made the game into the ghetto of the internet, by trying to impose strict control measures on every level and adding mini-game “Welfare” and pay-to-play payments. It’s dead, and a good thing too. Time to move on.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>I’m sorry to announce publicly that after today I will no longer be involved with the official server or any serious Runescape emulation projects. I say that with a heavy heart, and I’m grateful to Tom and Davidi2 for the chance and time we spent together trying to create an emulator for the community. I’ve been apart of many projects over the years and I’ve met a lot of great people but I feel as if my time with Runescape emulation has grown beyond that of what can help me grow as a programmer and that I need to move on. Notably I had a great time working on the Moparscape server, both the original and my rendition, PRS06, my creations, and Silabgarza. I wouldn’t be the programmer I am today without this community and I don’t regret the hundreds of hours I spent trying to push the boundaries of emulators or research new topics.</p>
<p>I think this post, as dramatic as it may sound, is speaking to the community. Runescape is growing old, and the excitement that came with trying to discover how Jagex as a company operated at least for me died two years ago with the decline in the games popularity. My passion these past few years were driven by my taste to try and see a rise in the community, and have these adventures once more but I know now that isn’t plausible.</p>
<p>I was content on working on the server until recently I became involved with a project outside of Runescape emulation. This opportunity opened my eyes to the skills I could possess that are outside of emulation and the choice was simple. I have found that in the past year I have decided I want to get into game development so I can create a similar feeling to how I felt when I first loaded into Runescape about ten years ago with everyone.</p>
<p>I suggest to you that you try not to take this all as serious as some of you may, although taking this seriously is wise, I think everyone is really sensitive about how their image stands among people. I wish I spent more of my time instead of getting offended by how people saw me had more fun, and just enjoyed the ride. It went by fast, six years now I’ve been developing servers since the age of 14 and now looking back I know at least I accomplished much. I had a lot of feuds, I made a lot of friends. Making emulators can lead to skills to land you a job but it’s very limited because of the limitations of creativity you constrain yourself to. I found it hard to advance past the level I reached because I simply didnt understand all the nuances of the game client and the architecture of design.  People still are learning things today, and I think those skills are better applied to creating instead of emulating. There is a lot of talent here, it just needs better focus instead of wasting effort on something that is too niche.</p>
<p>With those remarks, thank you seriously to the following people. Silabsoft for providing a good bounty of information and security testing the server, Tom for helping me get the server to the point it was, Davidi2 for ideas and your dedication to trying to help me move my work forward, Taharok for giving me helpful advice on programming when I needed it, Lothy for bouncing ideas back and forth when we had nothing to do, Zuppers for testing and providing critical information for the server.</p>
<p>To clear up “Well you quit and start something new”, most of that time thats true because the extent of how far I got with any of my projects was at the level where I could have written Runescape in its near entirety. What is there to do beyond that when the market is so diluted? I get very bored when I dont have anything to do and finding a challenge in writing content, or any of the nuances was very short lived. The past few weeks I’ve spent in botting I’ve learned as much as I have over the summer minus the effort I spent working with Runescript (CS2). Which I did, I spent some time the past two weeks scraping data from OSRS. That was a blast. If you have never gotten into hacking on that level, I recommend it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope you forgive me if you’re disappointed and what the staff here decide to do I will obviously not be involved in.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
