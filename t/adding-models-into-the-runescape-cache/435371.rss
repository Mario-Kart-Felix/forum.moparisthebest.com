    <title>Adding models into the runescape cache?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-models-into-the-runescape-cache/435371</link>
    <description>This post is about the actual runescape and it&#39;s cache, i am sorry if this is in the wrong forum but it seemed to be the best suited to answer such a question.


I am interested in knowing if it is possible to take an old model from a previous version, and add that model into my existing runescape cache. I know it is possible to swap around item id&#39;s in the existing cache, but what about the actual models? I have no previous knowledge of how the runescape cache works in particular, or how often the cache will actually update.


If this is possible, would the game eventually try to kick out the model i put in, and put the current looking model in it&#39;s place? I am specifically interested in replacing the barrows armour, as well as pretty much everything that was updated today.


If there is something I am not being clear about please let me know and ill try my best to elaborate. Thanks!</description>
