    <title>Sick of getting spammed by email?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sick-of-getting-spammed-by-email/44387</link>
    <description>Ok, say you want to register for a site, but they need your email, but i dont want to give it, i dont want that dam spam, well you dont have to anymore!!

By clicking on the link below, you will be given a temporary e-mail address. Any e-mails sent to that address will show up automatically on the web page. You can read them, click on links, and even reply to them. The e-mail address will expire after 10 minutes. 

Why would you use this? Maybe you want to sign up for a site which requires that you provide an e-mail address to send a validation e-mail to. And maybe you don&#39;t want to give up your real e-mail address and end up on a bunch of spam lists. This is nice and disposable. And it&#39;s free. Enjoy
