    <title>Question about woodcutting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-about-woodcutting/259811</link>
    <description>I was parsing through my client and i found this.

		case 1309:
			// Yew Tree
			pEmote = 0x284;
			woodcutting[0] = 9;
			woodcutting[1] = 60;
			woodcutting[2] = 715;
			woodcutting[4] = 1515;
			woodcutting[5] = 3;
			break;


woodcutting[4] = 1515; is obviously telling what item to give player 
and
woodcutting[1] = 60; is the lvl requirments.
I&#39;m pretty shure woodcutting[2] = 715; is the xp from it.
but,
what does [0] and [5] do? plus wheres [3] and what would that do?

This is a delta source.</description>
