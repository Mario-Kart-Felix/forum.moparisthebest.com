    <title>[COD4] Can someone explain this?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cod4-can-someone-explain-this/294923</link>
    <description>So, my friend got a mic and we thought it&#39;d be a laugh to go on cod4 with mics. We only really did small games(tdm or hq), and I thought a ground war game would be nice. First game we went in we got slaughtered because of about 5 people on our team with a 1:10 kill:death ratio(not us  :P), so we leave and end up creating our game. He&#39;s on 2mbit, I&#39;m on 20mbit so obviously I&#39;m hosting it. About 5 minutes in, I start lagging, the game drops to 1fps for 4-5 seconds then back up to 5, before returning to normal, and it starts again. I leave and &quot;the host has ended the game&quot; pops up. 

If I was to host a 32, or 64 player game on my pc, I wouldn&#39;t lag, so why does COD4 lag when I&#39;m hosting an 18 player game?</description>

<p>hmm anyone else using your connection intensively? that can do it, also it might not be your end if they’re end is really bad it can affect yours<br>

<p>I was the only one using the line at the time, but it doesn’t explain why I can host 32 player games on KZ2 without lag.[/quote]<br>
because KZ2 handles connections 100x better than the call of duty games</p>
