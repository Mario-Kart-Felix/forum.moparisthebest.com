    <title>[317 - DELTA] Players nearby? [Rep++]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-delta-players-nearby-rep/431546</link>
    <description>Anyone know where and how to add the players nearby?

I know how to actually add it, but I&#39;m not sure what the code is for it.


I.E. Your at the home area with your clan of 4. 

So 5 people online.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Players Near: 4&lt;/blockquote&gt;


I&#39;ll rep++ for any help.
Thanks,
