    <title>Quest; Will update</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quest-will-update/189254</link>
    <description>What i will be doing:
Okay i have a concept of a quest i will be working on and i need some feedback.

okay the player talks to the npc and gets teleported to fight a monster and if u can beat him u get the quest.
Once you succed you are teleported back to the old man and he tells you the quest. You will next be teleported to a maze once you finish it you fight a monster the monster will teleport you to an area with a couple high level monsters teaming you. if u reach the other side and tag the post it will take you to a final boss and if you succed you get the reward of a barrows (grandexchange box) you use it on the alter and get the barrows.
feedback good or bad is accepted i will be working and looking for suggestion determining the turn out i will probably release as a tut of not  copy/paste :D actually teaching you,
Thanks!
