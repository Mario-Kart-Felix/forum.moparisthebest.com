    <title>Earn an A? Here’s $50</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/earn-an-a-here-s-50/277796</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Up to 5,000 freshmen at 20 Chicago public high schools will get cash for good—and even average—grades as part of a new, Harvard-designed test program that city education leaders are rolling out Thursday.

Students will be measured every five weeks in math, English, social sciences, science and physical education. An A nets $50, a B equals $35 and a C still brings in $20. Students will get half the money upfront, with the remainder paid upon graduation. A straight-A student could earn up to $4,000 by the end of his or her sophomore year.

Parents have been rewarding children for stellar report cards for decades. Chicago Public Schools officials are nodding to that tradition and saying the idea is to get students to stay in school and do well while they’re there.

“The majority of our students don’t come from families with a lot of economic wealth. I’m always trying to level the playing field,” said schools chief executive Arne Duncan. “This is the kind of incentive that middle-class families have had for decades.”

Chicago is following the lead of similar programs in their infancy in New York and Washington. The district’s plan, part of the “Green for Grade$” program, involves no taxpayer money—the $2 million over two years comes from private sources.

Critics suggest that what amounts to bribing students to get good grades isn’t the right lesson to teach.

“It’s a terrible idea, because you’re getting people to do things for the wrong reasons,” said Barry Schwartz, a Swarthmore College psychology professor who has written on the issue. “They’ll do well in school, maybe, but they won’t take any of it out with them. Instead of trying to cultivate an interest in learning, curiosity … you are just turning this into another job.”

The message is selling just fine, however, at Uplift Community High School in Uptown.

Jeremy Kellum, 14, a freshman, said that although he’s accustomed to getting C’s, especially in science and social studies, getting paid as much as $4,000 is all the incentive he needs to hit the books harder.

“I do love green money… . I’ll shoot for A’s instead of slacking off, getting by with a C now,” Kellum said. “My plan is to study more, to not play in class as much as I did last year, and basically pay attention to the teacher and take good notes and pass tests.”

Duncan said that’s the type of dedication he’s after from students.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

              <p>IMO it’s a bad idea. If student’s can’t be bothered to perform reasonable, they can piss off. In today’s society every adult has a responsibility.

Without education everyone won’t get higher then the intelligence level of a garbage collector.</p>
<p>So those who can’t be bothered performing in school because they think it’s cool should be beaten put on a school where hitting them with sticks is allowed. Just beat some sense into those assholes.</p>
