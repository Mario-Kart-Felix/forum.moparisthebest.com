    <description>I came across this game yesterday while i was looking at the improvements in NaCl. It was shown in a youtube video showing games created using NaCl. I found it pretty fun. idk if its really the game that i found fun or that it is utilising NaCl and its cross-platform and cross-device allowing a large audience to play together. having mac, linux, android, and windows users all playing together on the same server seeing the same UI.

Idk i thought it was pretty cool so i thought i would share. It runs really well on my laptop which gets like not much better than 30 fps on minecraft. if you can run minecraft you should be fine on this game. idk what the specs are but my phone runs it fine but then again my phone is one of the best available atm(samsung epic 4g touch). I tried playing it on my cr-48 but it is quite laggy to the point its almost unplayable but the specs on the cr-48 are probably netbook range or less.</description>
