    <description>can someone explain it for me? I&#39;m not sure I quite understand it.

              <p>[quote=“zyle1992, post:2, topic:470341”]You can take a look at my code <a href="http://pastie.org/5451040" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, you have three pillars in Object-oriented Programming; encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.</p>
<p>Encapsulation is basically hiding all data from other objects (an instance of a class). More specifically, if an object doesn’t need to know about a field of another object, it shouldn’t be able to access it. wL-based servers are notorious for violating every aspect of OOP, especially encapsulation (client.skillXP[skills.id], client.running, etc)</p>
<p>Inheritance is, as the name suggests, inheriting behaviors (methods) and traits (fields) from it’s parent (super) class. In the code example, <span class="bbcode-b">Cat</span> and <span class="bbcode-b">Dog</span> share the common parent Animal, and therefore inherit the <span class="bbcode-i">makeSound</span> method.</p>
<p>Polymorphism (which is what this thread is really about) is basically a result of inheritance. As you see in <span class="bbcode-i">Main.java</span>, an array of Animal objects is created. However, you can’t tell whether the <span class="bbcode-b">Animal</span> that’s making a sound is a <span class="bbcode-b">Cat</span>, or a <span class="bbcode-b">Dog</span>, and the program doesn’t need to know. It just knows that it is an <span class="bbcode-b">Animal</span>, and can make a noise.</p>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6308178/what-is-the-main-difference-between-inheritance-and-polymorphism" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Here</a> is probably a more accurate explanation if you’d like to take a look.[/quote]</p>
<p>Alright that makes a bit more sense, i’ll probably have another look when i get home from school</p>
