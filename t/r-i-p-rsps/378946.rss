    <description>Spring 2004 - February 1, 2011. 
Return of wilderness.
Return of free trade. 

We all saw a huge influx of players when Jagex Screwed up by removing the wildy and free trade. Now they are fixing their mistake...
Need I say more? R.I.P. RSPS

              <p>[quote=“casey., post:8, topic:378946”]No, things are different than when RSPS were first introduced.</p>
<p>You can die with 20m and have it back in a day. Players aren’t leaving real RS for a site like this.<br>
RS is so much easier than it was back in 06.[/quote]SO much agreement. I started playing back in '06, and shit was hard (maybe, not hard, but you had to actually work for things) – but fun – back then. You can’t even have fun without tons of gold anymore; the economy is screwed up the bumhole 5x over.</p>
<p>I personally came to RSPS simply because I wanted to make my own stuff; do it my own way. Not because of a lack of wildy or anything.</p>
<p>EDIT: Actually, now checking, I guess I started back in early '05. I forgot. I always use my rubber chicken as reference for when I started RuneScape for when I can’t remember. xD</p>

<p>I understand more players playing RS Could mean more players for RSPS. But we won’t know if thats a true reflection.</p>

<p>I don’t really see how it’s the staffs fault. They can’t control who joins and force people to contribute, they just maintain the community and keep things orderly. But I would agree that the decline is probably due to a combination of different factors.</p>

<p>That was in no way funny. Why would you use Korasi and DDS? Korasi’s spec would do much more damage, making it a one trick pony. It really is a welfare weapon. Hell, anything cheaper than a whip is welfare.</p>

<p>there are new prayers, weapons etc which people don’t not like which is why people will continue to play and stay. i think players will go back to runescape (like me) but i will never leave this site and stop playing a p server along with it, because it feels the same as 06.</p>

              <p>Why does everyone keep saying that the return of free trade and the wilderness will be the end of RSPS? Nothing is really going to happen.

<p>If anything there will be more people coming to private servers. With more interest in Runescape itself, there will be more people out there interested in emulation.</p>
<p>Everyone isn’t just going to leave, I’m pretty sure most of you still play Runescape now, be it botting or legitimately.<br>
The return of the wilderness and free trade really isn’t that much of a big deal. It’s just over hyped.</p>
