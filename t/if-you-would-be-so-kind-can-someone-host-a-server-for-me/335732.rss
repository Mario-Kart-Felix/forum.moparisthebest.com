    <description>Hi Everyone... My computer&#39;s IPconfig and stuff is all screwed up because of stupid Hamachi,  :mad: (Hoping to get a laptop soon...) I was wondering if someone would host a server for me. (I will supply source) I&#39;ll edit the map, and give you code that&#39;s already set, and all you have to do is install it in. I will be doing all the design work and you would be running the server. I would make you staff on the server. Also I am looking for someone to make a client with my background image, everytime I try to do it on my own It never works!  :mad: :mad: :mad: Thanks everyone!  :D
