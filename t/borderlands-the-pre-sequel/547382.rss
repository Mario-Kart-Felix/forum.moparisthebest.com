Finished the main story last night. It was pretty good! However, I’d value the game at $40 at the most, not $60. Time for TVHM. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

<p>Unkempt, Sandhawk, Interfacer + Magic Misslex4, or Slagged Rubi lead to a near instant kill a vast majority of the time on most major raid bosses. Yeah it had to be used in conjunction with another elemental type/non but it never was an inconvenience.</p>

              <p>Still need to finish BL 1 and 2 before I can be bothered to get the pre-sequel, but I’ve put several hours into both of those playing co-op not paying attention to the story, with one of my friends who is a BL fanatic, and ever since it came out it’s what he’s always on steam playing when he’s not at work. So I must only assume it’s just as good as the first two.</p>

              <p>I have a level 28 Nisha. Not going to lie, I’m really disappointed compared to BL1 and BL2. At the midnight release it didn’t even keep me interested past 3am. I don’t know if it’s because they took so little time to develop the game (less than 2 years as opposed to over 4 with BL2), the outsourced company working on the game, or what, but it’s very… glitched at some points (objectives, way points, character interaction, etc…) and the story doesn’t tie in well for a “pre-sequal” like I hoped it would, they’re some conflicting ideologies in the story line if you dissect it. Even IGN rated the game an 8.0, which isn’t bad, but compared to BL1 with an 8.8 and BL2 with a 9.0, that’s pretty disappointing. The mapping and color scheme is also something they’ve returned to their BL1 roots upon, they’re all desolate and bland. BL2 had the best maps out of the three games by far; and I understand that they have the moon to work with so there are limitations, but still… The ice weaponry is stupid, dumb element to add IMO. I like laser weaponry, the characters, player movement, and that’s about it so far. The story isn’t impressing me as a whole. It should’ve been condensed into a BL2 add-on DLC. Just my opinion, I’m passionate about this series since they’re my favorite so I tend to be very critical and bias.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/eddie">@Eddie</a>, BL2 is fantastic once you get into it.</p>

              <p>borderlands 2 was bought by baddy351 for me and I just don’t like the style of it. Looks too futuristic for my game desires. About the only thing I like about it is how all the art is personally drawn from what I was told.</p>

<p>I always go through the 1st playthrough on my own so I can get the whole story without distractions. After that, it’s always co-op!</p>
