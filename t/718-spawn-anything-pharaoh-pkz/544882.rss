    <title>[718] Spawn anything! Pharaoh Pkz</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-spawn-anything-pharaoh-pkz/544882</link>
    <description>Pharoah Pkz is a 718 Matrix sourced server where Item spawning is enabled! For every item! You may pk, go bossing, or just chill! I have enabled dicing for everyone! You may even gamble (Dicing), but without the risk of loosing your hard earned items! I will be giving out free donator ranks and staff positions! First player gets mod! Next 3 get Extreme Donator, 2 After that get normal donator! Donators can use Imbued rings, Torva and rares! 

I have enabled item spawning on this server because I don&#39;t see many servers where they let you spawn whatever you want, and just have fun. I thought it would be a good idea to let players just fool around with unlimited items, and just practice pking skills!

No website because it&#39;s not really needed for a spawn server.

Keep in mind this server was created for you to have fun! Not for money or kind of benefit at all!
