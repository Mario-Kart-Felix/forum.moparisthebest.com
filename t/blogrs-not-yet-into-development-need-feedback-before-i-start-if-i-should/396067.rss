    <title>blogRS - not yet into development, need feedback before I start. (If i should)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/blogrs-not-yet-into-development-need-feedback-before-i-start-if-i-should/396067</link>
    <description>I have this idea. Where, you sign up, like a RS account diary. Post achievements, goals, statistics, anything imaginable about your account.

I need feedback though, would you guys use it? It would have PHP dynamic signatures like draynor does where you can add it to your signature (goals and what not).

Just a summer project i might look further into, bored and free time only.

Whatdoyathink?

Need criticism please.

Oh, and if it&#39;s in the wrong section, please move. Sorry if it is.</description>

Yes, for both.  But, can you make the signatures now?  I have signatures, but I was too lazy to do the draynor way.  And make a tutorial for it?</p>
