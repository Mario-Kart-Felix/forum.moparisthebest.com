    <description>What are your favorite lyrics? To any song, post lyrics of songs not, every lyric to the song. 

Avenged Sevenfold - Fiction
&lt;blockquote&gt;Left this life to set me free
Took a piece of you inside of me.
Now this hurt can finally fade
Promise me you&#39;ll never be afraid.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That whole album is very meaningful, but i would have to say that fiction is one of my favorite songs on the album.</description>

              <p>Tupac - Me against the world</p>
<blockquote>With all this extra stressin
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finaly get to rest? Through this supression
they punish the people that's askin questions
And those that possess, steal from the ones without possesions
The message I stress: to make it stop study your lessons
Don't settle for less - even the genius asks-es questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin of riches, in a position of makin a difference
Politicians and hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nuttin like the game
It's just me against the world</blockquote>

I even done the legal stuff and was leaded astray
Now money is the root to the evilist ways
But have you ever been so hungry that it keeps you awake
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed
Great, it feels like a long time coming, fam
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream I tried to chase it
But I wasn’t going nowhere, running man!
I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Trying to turn a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyones a kid that no-one cares about
You just have to keep screaming until they hear you out</blockquote>
