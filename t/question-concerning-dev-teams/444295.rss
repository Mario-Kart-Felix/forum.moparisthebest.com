    <title>Question concerning dev teams</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-concerning-dev-teams/444295</link>
    <description>So I was wondering... 

Are current  servers actually able to make a &quot;dev team&quot; a  &quot;dev team&quot; I would had thought would be non  hosted  server. 

Several of the  teams ( this even goes for server dev threads )  a lot of the servers are already hosted.  

Development  of something in the  programming language is  referred to  something that is not  fully  constructed yet.</description>

              <p>Well, just report anyone that’s doing it wrong and a mod can handle it. If this is an issue after the server advertisements board is added, then post this topic here again. Thanks.</p>

              <p>But that’s about what happens lol ( sorry took so long to post been gone this weekend )</p>
<p>Name  three threads that have actual development updates. Name three threads that I can’t go to the section and then search the name of the server/poster  for the server on the serverstatus page. Even kroniz is pretty much advertising. HE made forums the very exact day the development was made. ( not meaning to target anybody but it was first one that  came to mind )</p>

<p>As far as the actual section goes, I almost think as though the development section should be rethought. It doesn’t achieve its original goals because it’s gone unhandled over the years.</p>

              <p>That’s the thing though. I am always having to post in server development and development teams. “What are your objectives” you can’t  start a  development with no goals. Let’s be honest about 80% of the time it’s really just advertisement.  There needs to be some sort of stipulation I would think.</p>

              <p>I don’t particularly get what you’re saying? If you’re implying that a server development team can’t actually be what it says on the tin as servers are already fully constructed, then I wouldn’t necessarily agree with you. Server development teams usually have a list of criteria that they look to complete such as creating a certain skill or fixing a certain bug, and that counts as development in my opinion. There are many many flaws with today’s servers that need fixing and further development, and I guess some teams aim to do those things.</p>
<p>I guess it depends on what you consider ‘development’. That’s just what I think anyway.</p>
