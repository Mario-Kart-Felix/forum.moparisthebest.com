It’s luck, but you can make extreme profit if you land one.</p>
<p>Right now I’ll tell you my method. I have a good friend who sells me gold for 50c/m and I sell it for 80/1.00M on sythe.<br>
It’s a constant stock as he runs vps Sorc Garden on a giant cycle of bots.</p>
<p>I also try to scout items which I can flip. For example, I used to buy Santa’s for 75$ and sell for 85M. Sell the gold and reinvest. It’s all about being smart. Anyone can do it.(Keep in mind I’ve been doing this for several years now)[/quote]<br>
If I were you I’d cash in on it before it becomes worthless.</p>

Using melee. Only zeal on mage.</p>
<p>Greeny, my days of playing RS for fun are far over. I haven’t played for fun since about 2006 to be honest with you.<br>
I honestly don’t know why I’m still doing this. I just find it funny seeing how (if I can) get in the top 100, than top 50, etc all by botting how much Jagex has failed. Remember, we (were) a RS cheating site and most of us on this site come from cheating backgrounds, so in the end I will always feel cheating wins.</p>
<p>Also, the script is a combination of mine and others. I had to make it suit me in the effort to maximize zeal and getting into games. It’s vital to get 9 zeal an hour in all honesty. Anything less and I view it as a failure.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/playing">@Playing</a> their game, I get pins for about $2.00. I can pick that up on the ground if I want. Or in about a day of adsesne. Or sell 2m. It’s not much.</p>
<p>As said, my goal will always be to do the opposite of what Jagex says. I’m making A LOT of money off RS right now, in a 100% legal manner(I suppose I’m obliged to say that or I will be banned), but my goal is always to somehow make a profit. I don’t do anything illegal; I don’t steal accounts, phish, or scam cash. I find initiative merchanting ways and use social engineering to profit.  You don’t hang around <span class="hashtag">#Runescape</span> much, but if you did you would know I have a large amount of rares(Being over 60,000) and have a few more coming soon(around 20 phats) from a person who promised me them but went MIA two years ago, but the guy is pretty much the reason this site exists so I have hope he’ll be back <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> If I were to sell everything now(Gold, Accounts, ETC I’d be well over the 100,000 mark.</p>
<p>In all honesty, it’s not about winning. It’s about fun. I’m happy and enjoying life so what does it matter?</p>
<p>Also, I have enough zeal for Top 500.</p>

<p>Wasn’t meaning to argue anyway, I just laughed at you referring to it as an “achievement” since any sense of  achievement is entirely down to the individual. On an individual scale, you might be the richest man on Earth and feel it a huge achievement, on a cosmic scale you’ve achieved a grand total of fuck all <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

Of course you can make 10^5 valid arguments against my stance, but you can’t deny that he has ‘beaten’ Jagex to a certain extent.</p>
