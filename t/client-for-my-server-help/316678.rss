    <title>Client for my server help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-for-my-server-help/316678</link>
    <description>OK, so I have a server and I also have a client. When someone downloads my client it has an error that says &quot;error reconnecting in 10...9...8 etc&quot; and it counts down and never connects, I think the problem is with the compiler [code]@echo off
:menu
title StabbingScape compiler
@echo Compiling.....
if exist &quot;%programfiles%\Java&quot; (call :compile &quot;%programfiles%\Java\&quot;) else (goto error)
:compile
for /D %%x in (&quot;%~1jdk*&quot;) do (set p=&quot;%%~x\bin\javac.exe&quot;) 
if defined p (%p% -cp . *.java)
if defined p (goto end)
:error
echo You do not have Java installed. Please download it at the site that is about to load.
&quot;%programfiles%\InternetExplorer\iexplore.exe&quot; http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
:end
echo Compiling Finished.
pause
exit [/code] I am not sure if its my compiler or not, but is there a way i can make my client so it doesn&#39;t need jdk to download?</description>
