    <title>The Lag Report (left out info)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-lag-report-left-out-info/138715</link>
    <description>As you know I awhile back wrote the lag report in which explained what the true cause of lag was. Lately I&#39;ve been getting alot of crap about lag on my server, so I will inform you all of somethings I may have left out in this report. I may be restating a few but all good information will be of use.

[list]Complaints Recieved:

[ul][li]Server Lags way too much[/li]
[li]I cant move!!![/li]
[li]server crashes to much[/li]
[li]too lagy!!![/li][/ul]
Ok if you get this alot then you should know that server lag if any only accounts for .01% of the lag. As stated in the report the server is not the major factor of lag nor should be even considered when elimenating lag.

[list]Common Causes of Lag:

[ul][li]Client&#39;s age[/li]
[li]The users ISP[/li]
[li]The users pc specifications[/li]
[li]YOUR ISP[/li]
[li]Xbox360&#39;s[/li]
[li]Networking[/li][/ul]
You may have noticed that some of the listed was not mentioned or not fully explained in the report. Now let&#39;s start with the Xbox360 lord knows we love em&#39; but the question is . . . have you played online? If you have then the odds are pretty high that you have seen a player in the lobby with a red marked connection. This means that that players connection is poor. Since all xbox360&#39;s in online play are &quot;linked&quot; if one persons xbox360 is slow then it will cause lag in the game itself, that is a proven fact. The reason I bring that up is because the same applies for this rsps (RuneScape Private Server). If someone has poor connection and connects to your server then it will slow you down. Now you cannot expect everyone to obtain top rank ISP speed. Now I do not feel like going over the same report so I will add information that was not previously put in the report.

  I had if you recall mentioned weather as being a factor in the lag. I do not recall fully explaining this. But ok if your weather situation is bad i.e there is a storm or a heat wave going on then your connections weather phone based or wireless are going to slow. As we know heat does effect preformance of computers if not kept cool well to hot means melt down . . . Example my computer was fully customized for pro-programming and pro-gamming so my pc is fast, again my pc I brought it up because the specifications on it mean that it uses alot of power. Heatwaves drainpower &quot;brownouts&quot;. *side note: when I turn my pc on all the lights in the house dim*.

Now this brings us to overclocking our computers yes this too causes great lag but it varies pending on your overclock use. If you are like me and design games then your pc memory gets used up fast and lower memory lower speed. BTW to free up space system mechanic works wonders. Free up memory keep your system cool and that will reduce lag.

I won&#39;t lie to you. You cannot fully remove lag. That is because lag is caused by users other then yourself. If their pc is slow *caugh*windows 95*caugh* then they will slow you down by causing lag.

Ok now as for server crashing . . . wait rather client crashes there are a few reasons which they may have crashed. My server uses graphix and items that other clients do not support that means if I use the anger sword on a client or near a user whoms client does not have the ability to view that item it will either cause lag and &quot;lag them out&quot; or crash their client due to unrecognized item. Example my server has an RPDT store . . . ya ya PUT them rpdt workers to use. I use them as a store in this store items which only newer clients can use because it crashes old clients. If this is your deal then give out your client so that others will have one compatible with the server. In doing that the lag will be reduced.


Networking. The special bond two computers or more will share with eachother. Well if your networked with another pc it could cause lag depending on the other computers actions at the time. My advice to you is if at all possible networking should be avoided if possible. No major deal unless your XP is linking with an older/newer pc again compatability.

Let&#39;s talk in game stuff shall we?

Ok first off have you ever noticed that when players log on their one of their first destinations are the dummy room aka the one across from the bank in varrock. They all seem to want to hang out in one spot, frankly IDK why because NPC&#39;s give exp as well if not faster. Well there is a problem with grouping multiple connections and speeds all in one location with variety of click speeds. My server has flagged over 14 speed clicks if you will, and some idiots do come on to servers and spam yup laggy. In this case your best goal is to even the field out slightly and by this I mean get users to falador, camalot, lumby, and other places i.e the wild. Spread them out alittle so that they are not cluttering one spot because if you have 10 people in one location odds are many of those people will be clicking the same dummy/npc some even spammin them with clicks. An object recieving mass clicks from many different people at once will cause lag.

Wow lot of writting but anyway moving on to our next point. NPC&#39;s love em&#39; but go easy. I refer to my server because I&#39;m on it the most so in my server alot of npc&#39;s hangin out. Now if you have 20 npc&#39;s in one location it is clutter spread them out or cut the numbers down. I had like 20 guards just east of varrocks east bank and like five steps from that I had 20 or more goblins to many to close and frankly were not even needed so I took them out as I said before space out your npc&#39;s and keep it low.

Talking npc&#39;s cause lag as well so a word of advice is not all of them need to be chattin&#39;.

Keep your servers clutter down with-in reason and lag will be lessened.

I hope this post was informative to you. Also Check my post history for the original lag report and download it if you desire. I plan on writting more reports on this subject as time goes on but due to the amount of complaints recieved it was apperent that information on lag was needed.</description>
