    <title>Fradverts.com - Free adverts!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fradverts-com-free-adverts/201696</link>
    <description>Hey guys! I don&#39;t really use these forums any more, but I&#39;m well aware there&#39;s a few of you on here who understand design and how it works.

I&#39;m just leaving a topic to tell you guys about my new project, Fradverts. Fradverts simply stands for free adverts. It provides free web traffic to your blog, site, or page. The main idea is that people post their banner free of charge, which gets displayed on the site, then when somebody else goes to post their banner, they&#39;re exposed to potentially hundreds of other adverts! And for people who are looking for something specific, you can use the &#39;fradegories&#39; page, where you&#39;ll find all of the frads, arranged into a collection of different categories.

You can take a look at the site by [url=http://www.fradverts.com]clicking here[/url]!

If you&#39;ve got a site, and you need free, fast traffic, submit a fradvertisement!

I want you guys to give me some CC, comment on the layout, the graphics, the layout, the CSS, the implementation, the concept. Just tell me anything you wanna comment about!

Thanks!

              <p>But the banners only seem to appear on the Fradverts page, which means the traffic you are targetting is “people looking for traffic to their own website”.</p>
<p>Which is handy if your website is a guide to traffic building, but not really otherwise.</p>
