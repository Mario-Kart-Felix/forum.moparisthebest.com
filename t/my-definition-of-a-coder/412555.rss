    <title>My Definition Of A Coder</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-definition-of-a-coder/412555</link>
    <description>I come across kids on my server who call themselves coders and when I ask them simple questions like, &quot;how do you declare a variable?&quot; they have no idea. And if you don&#39;t know what that is then you have a lot to learn.

My definition of a coder is someone who can create their own class, understand variables, casting, and types, and can create methods and functions with a keen understanding of parameters. Then they have to know how to use and implement their class in another class without needing help. If you can do those basic things, you can be called a coder.

You arent a coder if you download a source and move some npcs around and then upload it. Thats just looking up numbers and plugging them in. You aren&#39;t a coder if you can follow tutorials on how to add minigames and commands. That&#39;s just copy and paste and takes no effort. A kid came up to me today and said, &quot;I&#39;m making a nazi zombie mini game.&quot; and I said, &quot;Really? Is it all of your code?&quot; he said yup. I went onto google typed runescape private server natzi zombies and the first link was a tutorial on here on how to do just that. 

So that is my definition of a coder and please don&#39;t call yourself a coder if you dont know how to do the things said above.

To be called a coder you have to have original ideas, not just ones someone else came up with that you copied and pasted.

Now you're an idiot for making false assumptions. Fix dupes with 1 line, and I failed by making 10 more glitchs/bugs? Never happened to me before. When I found out of a dupe I usually fixed it right away. Unless I didn't know how the dupe worked or no one told me about it. Please explain, and show proof how I manage to create hundreds of bugs out of no where.

<p>It also not hard to tell who he is because every post he does makes him obvious. I called you out the first post I read because you write the same stupid shit.</p>

<p>so you follow him around trying to identify who he is, but you’re not mad or pissed off at him… then why do you do it?</p>

</aside>
<p>Sad thing is that you are still not admitting to being him. Not really hard to avoid you when there is three sections. I barely come on here and only came on to see this thread because misterhat told me to come lol, plus the fact if you look back I have not actually followed you anywhere. I feel pretty special that you must love me that much to get my attention. You even turn around conversation to convince your self that it is me following you around because I care about you. Sorry I do not feel that way bro, I am sure someone else might give a fuck though. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Why would I admit to being someone I’m not? You clearly have a fixation with the guy, you told me on two different occasions that you can tell who the guy is just by reading what he says. I can’t even do that, with anyone, so how is it that you can come to this conclusion? It’s paranoia and obsession dude… Which is why I keep asking you what he has done to you.</p>
<p>Yes I asked you a few simple questions because… It needed to be asked. Now that I’ve read that thread again, you still haven’t answered the questions… Also don’t say “conversations” because it wasn’t. It was a conversation. You turned that thread around to convince yourself that I’m this guy you’re completely nuts over.</p>

</aside>
<p>I just need to point out that, Kermit is a troll. He’s baiting you. If I were to say (for example) “Pompano is RSCShadow”, does that make it true? So why are you taking the word of a troll?</p>
<p>Paranoia and obsession.</p>
<p>Kbye</p>

</aside>
<p>Oh I see, you know Kermit as well now. Strange how you registered recently yet you know all these people. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Why would you call your good friend a troll, I thought you invested time and money into that RSC source you and him were doing. Strange why you would call a good friend of yours a troll.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Why exactly do you keep directing questions towards me when I’m trying to leave? Lol…</p>
<p>you already asked how I know who certain people are… and I already answered that question. it’s the exact same reason you know who certain people are. you interact with them. i’ve been on the same irc channels as Kermit… how exactly does that mean i’m his “good friend”?</p>
<p>hardly a friend, i’ve seen him troll and had a laugh with him once or twice. we never spoke of any type of rsc server, you’re pulling that one straight out of your ass.</p>
<p>you are obviously having a hard time letting what he did to you go. dude it’s pathetic man.</p>
<p>if you’re gunna direct anymore questions to me, do it in irc (any channel will do)… i’m not going to sit here anymore and convince some nut that i’m not who he thinks i am…[/quote]</p>
<p>Whatever you say bro,</p>
<p>It obviously bothers you that much that you feel the need to come back and defend your self to say you are not Jessekins.</p>
<p>btw</p>
<p>Jessekins is mad.</p>

<p>Why would I admit to being someone I’m not? You clearly have a fixation with the guy, you told me on two different occasions that you can tell who the guy is just by reading what he says. I can’t even do that, with anyone, so how is it that you can come to this conclusion? It’s paranoia and obsession dude… Which is why I keep asking you what he has done to you.</p>
<p>Yes I asked you a few simple questions because… It needed to be asked. Now that I’ve read that thread again, you still haven’t answered the questions… Also don’t say “conversations” because it wasn’t. It was a conversation. You turned that thread around to convince yourself that I’m this guy you’re completely nuts over.</p>
<p>bah you know what… i’m done with this lol. think what you want[/quote]</p>

</aside>
<p>Oh I am not pissed off, I just think he is pathetic. Just watching him talk to everyone and me.  He gives off an impression of a sad lonely guy who used to get beaten as a kid. I mean he has no social skills on an Internet community let alone IRL.</p>
<p>It also not hard to tell who he is because every post he does makes him obvious. I called you out the first post I read because you write the same stupid shit.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>so you follow him around trying to identify who he is, but you’re not mad or pissed off at him… then why do you do it?[/quote]</p>
<p>Sad thing is that you are still not admitting to being him. Not really hard to avoid you when there is three sections. I barely come on here and only came on to see this thread because misterhat told me to come lol, plus the fact if you look back I have not actually followed you anywhere. I feel pretty special that you must love me that much to get my attention. You even turn around conversation to convince your self that it is me following you around because I care about you. Sorry I do not feel that way bro, I am sure someone else might give a fuck though. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Oh and here is the proof that you start conversations with me so gtfo.</p>
