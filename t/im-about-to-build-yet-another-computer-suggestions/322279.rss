    <title>Im about to build yet another computer. Suggestions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-about-to-build-yet-another-computer-suggestions/322279</link>
    <description>Well I just built my grandparents a computer for christmas by sacraficing my christmas, they thought that was really nice so they wrote me out a check for $300 and gave me their old computer.

Pentium 4 2.8GHZ
80GB Maxtor Harddrive
DVD Drive

Upgrades I had done to it since they had it:

2GB of some GSKILL 533 I think (worthless)
430 Watt Harddrive&lt;&lt;&lt;LOLEDIT: I mean PSU with cable sleeves
8400GT Video Card PCI ( Shit )

So im going to use that money and build myself a new one.


Im planning on reusing the harddrive, the DVD drive, and the PSU.

Im thinking about going the AMD way because they have better motherboards with integrated graphics. So I dont want to use all that money on it but maybe I will. Im not going to put in a GPU this time around so give me suggestions on AMD CPU, AMD MOTHERBOARD, AND RAM (also IE 8 is acting the fuck up right now so I cant see what im typing)......</description>

<p>Currently I don’t have enough money to buy a graphics card and im going to mostly use it as a htcp so something like a integrated ATI Radeon HD 4200 is good enough.</p>
