    <description>Yeah, I used to know how to do this, but that was WELL over a year ago, and a LOT has changed here since then.   And so, I would like to find tutorials about EVERYTHING I need to learn to be a decent coder and host.  I know there are hosting tutorials and stuff, and I did look in the...(insert name of the section used for tutorials)... but didn&#39;t find any on the basics themselves.

Links to guides on these are what im looking for.  I don&#39;t mind a long read :D

Yes, I admit that I currently know about 2 things about coding in Java.

1. Coding is complicated
2. Its a lot of weird text</description>

              <p>Lol. I taught myself coding (Although I’m not that good) but I started off by just copying commands, and just editing them. For example, I started off with a simple command like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"> if (command.startsWith("notedbarrows") &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 1)
			{
				addItem(4717, 1000);
                                addItem(4719, 1000);
        			addItem(4721, 1000);
        			addItem(4723, 1000);
        			addItem(4709, 1000);
        			addItem(4711, 1000);
        			addItem(4713, 1000);
        			addItem(4715, 1000);
        			addItem(4754, 1000);
        			addItem(4756, 1000);
        			addItem(4758, 1000);
        			addItem(4760, 1000);
        			addItem(4746, 1000);
        			addItem(4748, 1000);
        			addItem(4750, 1000);
        			addItem(4752, 1000);
        			addItem(4733, 1000);
        			addItem(4735, 1000);
        			addItem(4737, 1000);
        			addItem(4739, 1000);
        			addItem(4727, 1000);
        			addItem(4729, 1000);
        			addItem(4731, 1000);
        			addItem(4725, 1000);
			}</code></pre>
<p>Then I changed the numbers, for example “addItem(4752, 1000);” to the ID I wanted to put, like in this case, the code will be 4752, and that would be a barrows item. Then if I wanted to change it to cash, I would change 4725 to 995, and then change 1000 to the amount of cash I want to have when I type that command.</p>
<p>And java isn’t alot of weird words, it’s really easy.</p>
