    <title>Is it even possible to graph these and find a function?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-it-even-possible-to-graph-these-and-find-a-function/551714</link>
    <description>So I recorded this data:


Ay    |     Vec
___  |    ____
0      |   (0, 0, -0.67923)
332  |   (0.31888, 0, -0.599732)
36    |   (-0.39925, 0, -0.5495156)
200  |   (0.23231329, 0, 0.63827552)


I went to put this into my calculator then it hit me... &quot;How the fudge am I going to put this into my calculator.


How can I find a function that given variable &quot;Ay&quot;, it returns the x and z values of the returning vector?


or is that not possible?


EDIT: Facepalm... I&#39;m a bloody idiot, I could just pair the &quot;Ay&quot; up with all of the X&#39;s in the vector and the &quot;Ay&quot; with all of the Z&#39;s...</description>
