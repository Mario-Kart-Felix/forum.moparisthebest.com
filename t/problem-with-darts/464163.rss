    <title>Problem with darts</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-darts/464163</link>
    <description>Im trying to make it so when you use a dart on my server, the dart will go away from the equip slot and disappear. 
Thanks if you can help! :p 

Edit:
basically when you use a steel dart, or bronze,etc. once the dart is used, it gets taken from the equip slot and dropped on the ground, I made a new dart for insta kill dart and i want it to be taken from equip slot and disappear instead of dropped on ground, and the dart in using is dragon dart and doesn&#39;t even get taken when used or dropped, basically acting as a infinite dart..</description>
