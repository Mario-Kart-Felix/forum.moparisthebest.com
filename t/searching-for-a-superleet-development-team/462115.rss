    <description>[center]Hello I would first like to welcome you to my Recruitment page, in here I will be describing for you what exactly I am looking for, and what I am trying to accomplish.[/center]
[hr]
[center]BASE: Advanced &#39;[size=18pt]Project Insanity[/size]&#39;. [PI]
What skills I am looking for;
an advanced GFX Designer.
an advanced Graphic Designer.
an Expert Java Programmer.

I probably sound crazy asking for these skills because there what everybody needs, but I am vouched on becoming the Best of the Best,. I have spent to much Time, Money, and Effort to just give up at any time. I keep on pushing until I achieve what I need or even want.

I Want to be the Best of the Best,
I Need to be the Best of the Best,
So I will be the BEST of the Best.

Why is that you may ask?
Because I take Pride in my work, and accomplishing things on my own,..... I Try.

<p>So… Is this why you’re getting developers for every area? To do the work for you? :|[/quote]No, I don’t need them, it would just make things go smoother. To help put together good ideas and make them happen. Like I have some crazy good ideas, i’m just not 100% on how to make it happen. And with the GFX Designer, well he/she’s on there own, I know nothing about that shiznits. And I would LIKE a good Graphic designer…<br>
<a class="mention" href="/u/scarecrows">@Scarecrows</a> - I am the Best already. My server will be posted on New Years, and everyone will see.</p>
