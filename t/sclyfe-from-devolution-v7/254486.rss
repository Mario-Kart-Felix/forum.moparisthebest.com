    <description>Sclyfe

Hello, for some time now I have been planning to make a website about programming and gaming. Then I had the idea to get back into rs private servers. I created a website a while back for my programming site and I will be buying a full domain and make it about the rs private server we will be creating. I will be in need of help with coding the server/client. In this coming week I will be buying the domain, and forums should be open. But the server may take some time... if u want to help out contact me by posting here, pming me, and reaching my msn: ashy1000000@hotmail.com.

Im using devolution 7.0 as base because of its stabablity.
