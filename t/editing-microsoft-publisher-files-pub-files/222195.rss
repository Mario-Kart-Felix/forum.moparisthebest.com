    <title>Editing Microsoft Publisher files(.pub) files?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/editing-microsoft-publisher-files-pub-files/222195</link>
    <description>[s]Hmm. I&#39;ve been googling for the past hour and can&#39;t find any working solutions. I can&#39;t open a video with the mp4 encoding. I tried with Kaffeine (the default video player for Kubuntu), and it opens, it will open and begin playing, not showing any picture with the speed +3, so instead of it playing a second of the video a time, it plays 3 seconds of the video in one second.

But I can&#39;t hear anything or see anything. o.0
It works with all other video types :/    [/s]

Okay, I need to finish this Microsoft Publisher file for school, and I don&#39;t have windows on this drive as I made a mistake upon reformation etc, and OpenOffice doesn&#39;t have a program capable. I&#39;ve googled and a lot of sources have said that it can&#39;t done..?</description>
