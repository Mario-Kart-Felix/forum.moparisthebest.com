    <title>A somewhat easy problem...For some of you</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-somewhat-easy-problem-for-some-of-you/324646</link>
    <description>Hey, here is what&#39;s happening...

Every server I run it works both for me and people out of my network..

I got this new client and server from my friend, however, the sever runs fine but, the client doesn&#39;t load anymore than the &quot;Connecting to update&quot; or something like that...I was thinking maybe the client is set to address to the wrong IP, but, I looked in the Loader.java and it&#39;s heading towards the correct address.

Is there another place to check also or is there something else wrong?</description>
