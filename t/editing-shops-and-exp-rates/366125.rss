    <title>Editing Shops and Exp Rates</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/editing-shops-and-exp-rates/366125</link>
    <description>I have a little problem. Most people playing my server think that the experience rates are very slow, so I decided to raise them but I am note sure what folder it is called. I have a 508 Ninescape-source private server. It has the old Bulby.
[b]Folders that are not correct *DON&#39;T RE-POST THEM*:[/b]
None

Also, I want to know where to edit my shop items and prices. I have checked my util folder in bin AND Bulby. Neither one has anything related to shops.
This means don&#39;t post &quot;shops.cgf&quot;. I do not have that config file because of my version of Bulby. 
I have even tried looking it up. People said to go to Players.java and edit something like [code]shopint[/code] or something but it wasn&#39;t in that file.

I also have a friend who is using the same source as me. He has looked and can also not find it.</description>
