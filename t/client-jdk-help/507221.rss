    <title>Client Jdk help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-jdk-help/507221</link>
    <description>Hey I havn&#39;t posted on this forum very much but I have been looking through it a lot for tips and tricks. I need some help. I have made my server and managed to get it online. the only problem is when I send ppl the client that have to edit the run batch file to their specific jdk type becaue when they try to run it it says &quot;system cannot find the path specified&quot;.

How I can make the client so that the run works will most peoples java instead of everyone having to edit the run. is there a way of doing this??? what if I make a .jar file for the client??

Long question short: can I make the client run on most peoples java.</description>
