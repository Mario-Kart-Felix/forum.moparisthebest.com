    <description>Ok i got a question please reply. well i just downloaded zdiddyreload source + client that has sounds. the problem is when i attack any npc with a whip right after i click attack the sound goes up and after 2 seconds i attack. Is there anyway to slow the sounds down so it can go on when players attack with whip. Like what i mean i want the sound to go off when the player attacks with whip not 2 seconds before.</description>
