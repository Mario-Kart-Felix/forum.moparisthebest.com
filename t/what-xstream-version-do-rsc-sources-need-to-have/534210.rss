    <title>What xstream version do RSC sources need to have?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-xstream-version-do-rsc-sources-need-to-have/534210</link>
    <description>hi, i recently learned that the reason why, when I try to run the server, the server gets an error where there is no constructor is because the xstream it is using is outdated. Now I&#39;m wondering which version works with RSC because I tried 1.4.1 &amp; 1.4.2 and they produce errors that clearly show that it is not meant for this old of a server.</description>

I know JSONs all the rage right now but when it comes to reading data on launch its personal preference alone.<br>

              <p>hi, i recently learned that the reason why, when I try to run the server, the server gets an error where there is no constructor is because the xstream it is using is outdated. Now I’m wondering which version works with RSC because I tried 1.4.1 &amp; 1.4.2 and they produce errors that clearly show that it is not meant for this old of a server.</p>
