    <title>Connecting to my server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connecting-to-my-server/221536</link>
    <description>Yesterday i moved my router to a different location  in my house and now i can&#39;t connect to my server. I have the same ip adress as before, i&#39;m not sure if it has something to do with my no-ip, or something to do with my router. I was able to get on before i moved it. I can&#39;t move it back so telling me to move it back won&#39;t be an option.
I would apreciate help/suggestions on what i should do
Thanks!</description>
