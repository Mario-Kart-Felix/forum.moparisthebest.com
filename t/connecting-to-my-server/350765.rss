    <description>Hello, I just bought a VPS from vpsland.com, I am currently running a remote connection with it, and I just got my source files along with Java, no-ip etc. But when i hit &quot;run.bat&quot; I cannot connect to the server from my PC, I&#39;ve tried entering the VPS&#39; IP, I&#39;ve tried entering the No-Ip. None of them have worked. I was just wondering if I needed to portforward or something, becuase I tried entering my IP onto the address bar. But it didn&#39;t work :S</description>

              <p>Thanks, I really wasn’t asking for a spoon feeding answer, I just wanted someone who has been in my shoes and has resolved the issue tell me what I’ve done wrong. Since there can be many possibilities on why this is happening, which is why i spent time on the search bar and only found guides on how to set the VPS up, which I’ve already done. Thanks.</p>

<p>It’s not allowed to post about vps. Theres lots of guides on setting/using a vps. Uhm… Why not use the search button?</p>

<blockquote>1. All topics in this section must be requests for help on a server. Any non-server related questions will be locked. Requesting a host, 'coder'/programmer, server or client, or asking about a VPS also falls under being non-server related. That means for other sections on this site too.</blockquote>
Rule 1 is about requesting. He is clearly NOT requesting.
