    <title>[PI]Adding a slayer point system?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-adding-a-slayer-point-system/392311</link>
    <description>Okay so I&#39;m using Lost Legacy as my base, and slayer was already coded, with tasks and all that. It DOES NOT have a slayer points system or a slayer points shop. Could someone please link me to a tutorial, or tell me how to add a slayer points system (be rewarded for complete a task) and creating a shop for slayer points.</description>
