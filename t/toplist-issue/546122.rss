    <title>Toplist Issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/toplist-issue/546122</link>
    <description>I have had this issue with the toplist for a longtime and this still hasn&#39;t been solved even though I posted on the thread and eventually pm&#39;d staff.
My IP has changed due to losing my Dedicated Server and I wanted to change it to no-ip (it was the dedi ip for a while because of no-ip being shut down). No one responded to my request to change the ip on the toplist for nearly a month and now it shows I have a lot of down time and it has said offline for ages.

I would like this: https://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php?server=23.235.230.154

changed to: elveron.no-ip.org

Thanks a ton!</description>

              <p>PM Moparisthebest, if you ask nice enough he might consider doing it. The topic you posted the request on was designed for when no-ip had some issues and people needed their address changing to avoid downtime that was beyond their control. We have no policy for changing your SSP information and a lot of the time it won’t happen. All I can say is next time use no-ip initially instead of the server IP.</p>
<p>EDIT - I’ve been told your IP was changed to the server IP when no-ip went down, while this may seem unreasonable I’m going to have to stand by the above. You can ask MITB but you should’ve had your no-ip changed to another dynamic host.</p>
