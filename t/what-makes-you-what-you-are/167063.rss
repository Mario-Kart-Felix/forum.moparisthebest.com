    <title>What makes you what you are?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-makes-you-what-you-are/167063</link>
    <description>[b][size=3pt]If your just going to be a faggit and depict something out of this. Just fuck off. Honestly, i don&#39;t even want to fucking hear it.[/size][/b]



[ul][li]If you agree/disagree to below tell about it.[/li][/ul]

Does the type of music you listen make who you are? Does the way you dress make you who you are? Does the way you act make you the way you are?  Like the way i am i dress in 60% Black and the rest is just other darker colors and i wear Etnies and a double row studded belt. I listen to  death/black/screamo/a lot of other stuff metals. I can be a huge prick and shit but i&#39;m not. This kid asked me if i was emo and goth and then i just said are you a faggot or do you just act like it. And it really really really makes me wanna fucking go insane when people make first impressions on me. Because i&#39;m not a prick or anything and i almost never get into trouble at school or home. 

Do other people think the same way i do about this?</description>

              <p>What you wear or what music you listen to does not and should place you under a false stereotype in the eyes of others. I wear brands like Famous, Element, various rap brands, football paraphonelia, and etc., but I don’t let anybody place a stereotype on me. Everybody assumes that you’re a rapper if you listen to rap, or that you’re emo if you listen to metal or stuff like screamo, but it really doesn’t matter. Everybody has their own way of expressing themselves. If you disagree with that statement, then you’re just like the people who place stereotypes themselves.</p>

              <p>I’d like to pay my tribute here<br>
To Nanny Lot - to me most dear:<br>
And of the dearest Nan of all<br>
Some memories let me recall.</p>
<p>She never ever looked a mess<br>
Her favourite store was M and S -<br>
Wherever now she sits in state<br>
I’m sure she looks immaculate.</p>
<p>To buy us clothes was her delight -<br>
She never got the sizes right.<br>
She knew the right size all along,<br>
So why were they so often wrong?</p>
<p>The shops were where she loved to be<br>
And Nanny Lot, deliberately,<br>
Bought things that were too big or small<br>
And clearly didn’t fit at all!</p>
<p>She did this - I must now explain -<br>
So she could take them back again!<br>
(This, gentle laughter would provoke:<br>
It soon became a private joke)</p>
<p>We’d all enjoy the luxuries<br>
Of Nanny Charlotte’s spending sprees<br>
We’d pay our visits up and down<br>
To markets all round London Town</p>
<p>She loved to cook and Conga Eel<br>
Became our favourite - special meal<br>
And after that what would be better<br>
Than cola jelly or Vienetta?</p>
<p>I went to Pontins with my nan<br>
Then Clacton in a caravan<br>
And there most holidays I went<br>
And many happy times I spent.</p>
<p>And so her praises must be sung<br>
Of how she was when I was young -<br>
So when her health was a concern<br>
Her kindness I could then return.</p>
<p>And every week I’d do her hair<br>
And odd jobs here and odd jobs there<br>
And helping her to read and write<br>
And Bingo on a Sunday night.<br>
It was the least that I could do<br>
A recompense long overdue.<br>
I say with all sincerity<br>
I’m glad that she was proud of me.</p>
<p>I must pay thanks to Julieanne<br>
Who gave some present to our nan<br>
And that’s two girls and last one boy<br>
3 great grandchildren to enjoy!</p>
<p>And so the last thing that I do<br>
Is read these lines out just for you:<br>
To each and every one of us<br>
You were so kind and generous</p>
<p>Though I don’t play the record now,<br>
And the clothes no longer fit somehow,<br>
Remember you - we always will-<br>
Our memories are precious still.</p>
<p>Though you are gone you’re not forgot<br>
Our dearest, dearest Nanny Lot;<br>
And we can all be very sure<br>
You’ll rest in peace for evermore.</p>
