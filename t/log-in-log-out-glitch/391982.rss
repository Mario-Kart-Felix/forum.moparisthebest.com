    <title>Log in/Log out glitch</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/log-in-log-out-glitch/391982</link>
    <description>Hello everytime I try to log out, it take a couple seconds to log out. Then when I try to log back in after that it either says &quot;Error Connecting to Server&quot; or &quot;Your account is already logged in. Try again in 60 seconds...&quot;. But if I reload the client it logs on again. Can someone please tell me how to fix this glitch? Team viewer would be awesome if you can.</description>
