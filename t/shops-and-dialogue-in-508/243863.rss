    <title>Shops and Dialogue in 508</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shops-and-dialogue-in-508/243863</link>
    <description>Sorry for posting this twice. My other thread was buried somewhere around page 5.

Anyway, it&#39;s been a while since I last worked with RS private servers, and it was some older sources.

Anyway, I&#39;m wondering what I need to do to get dialogue and shops working in 508. I know this was previously possible, (in 317 or something) but I don&#39;t see anything in Palidino76&#39;s source that might help with this.

I&#39;m also wondering how I might go about handling for events, such as clicking to attack an NPC.

Thanks!</description>

              <p>Theres a list on Moparscape or Rune-Server for a list of 508 Tutorials. I’ve seen a dialogue one there, I’m almost positive.</p>
