    <title>New RSPS Coder. What should i know?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-rsps-coder-what-should-i-know/537349</link>
    <description>Hello, as the title describes, i&#39;ve been thinking about starting up a RSPS to do something productive.
I&#39;m good at coding, i know how to make a function, a class, etc. 

This is the list of things i would like to know on how to program once i have a downloaded server.

Which files should i edit for the following things:
If for example, i needed to add a command, where should i put the code for it? 
Does all the programming go in just one file, or i can create a class for each object i need? 

Is there any API i should know about that comes with runescape?

Any tutorial with the basics of runescape coding you could provide? 

Thanks a lot!</description>

<p>It’s different for every server. You claim to have sufficient programming knowledge, so you’ll probably be able to figure it out.</p>

<p>No, all of the code is not dumped in one file (which is what most people using delta, pi, and any other winterlove based server seem to be doing). Java is an Object Oriented programming language and should be used as so.</p>

</aside>
<p>There are networking APIs like netty and utility APIs like gson and xml but these don’t have to be used. Java has io/nio for networking and raw text can be used for loading data instead of json/xml/tsm etc.</p>

<p>They all suck. And you don’t need them.</p>
<p>You have the basic java knowledge so go download a proper base, preferably Runesource because you’re newer and Runesource was designed to be simple, light, and fast. Experiment with it and get familiar with the rs2 protocol (how runescape 2 works).</p>
<p>java knowledge + rs2 protocol knowledge = good rsps programmer</p>
