    <title>Looking for developers and model artists - Ambokile</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-developers-and-model-artists-ambokile/551689</link>
    <description>Hello everyone.

I am looking for [b]one[/b] client developer and [b]one to three[/b] model artists for an upcoming project of mine. The project is going to be a very innovative one which will attract a lot of publicity, will be unique and will be something that you can place on your portfolio. You will be compensated financially should the project receive any money.

Requirements for [b]client developer[/b]:

[ul][li]You must have experience working with a team. This does not have to be a software development team, any examples of where you have successfully worked with a team will be considered.[/li]
[li]You must have a strong programming background with Java experience.[/li]
[li]You must have experience with version control systems, preferably Git.[/li]
[li]You must have an understanding of the RuneScape client from a front-end perspective at least. You do not need to fully understand the mechanics behind it but understanding the client will make it a lot easier for you to work on it.[/li]
[li]You must have an understanding of the code style in the [url=https://github.com/Jameskmonger/317refactor]317refactor project[/url]. This does not have to be an in-depth understanding however you must have read through the majority of the code.[/li]
[li]You must have a can-do attitude. This is going to be a tough project however the rewards will be great when we complete the project.[/li]
[li]Applicants with a portfolio of works will be strongly favoured. I will be particularly impressed if you can create something, however small, using the [url=https://github.com/Jameskmonger/317refactor]317refactor project[/url]. (Seriously, create something using the 317refactor project and you will be strongly considered against all other applicants.)[/li][/ul]


Requirements for [b]model artist[/b]:

[ul][li]You must have experience creating models in formats suitable for the 317 RuneScape client. This does not just include creating them in the correct file type but also being able to convert them into the correct type, animating the models and creating them with suitable polygon counts.[/li]
[li]You must have experience working with a team. This does not have to be a software development team, any examples of where you have successfully worked with a team will be considered.[/li]
[li]You must have a portfolio of models that you have created yourself.[/li]
[li]You must be willing to learn whilst working. You will be required to take on a large amount of tasks, including creating the models, rigging the models and creating animations for them. You do not need to be able to do all of these as long as you are willing to learn.[/li]
[li]You must be able to create models in a low-poly style similar to that of the 2005/2006 RuneScape style.[/li][/ul]


All applicants must be able to dedicate at least 4 hours a week to work on the project. As I have stated, this project will attract a lot of publicity and will therefore be one that you can place on your portfolios in future.

If you are interested in applying, please send me a forum PM explaining which position you are applying for and how you meet the criteria listed above.</description>

<p>Yes, that is what I am doing. I currently have a graphics artist working with me who can produce very, very high quality models. I am looking for other team members nonetheless.</p>

<p>As a whole the engine is going to stay the same and the mechanics are going to stay the same, but there are going to be a lot of cache and content changes. I don’t want to give too much away yet but when you’re in the game you’ll be able to tell that it was based on RuneScape. If you think it’d be better suited elsewhere, feel free to move it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Pure, what is the meaning of getMEBInt and getMESInt?</p>

No… this isn’t the runescape engine board, it’s the private server board. If you’re working on something different we have other boards for that.</p>
<p>Would you prefer me moving it to Game Development or Java Programming?</p>

I think before you continue using ‘your’ client you might want to figure out what you’re doing with your networking, I’m sure it’s a crucial part of your project.

Nevertheless good luck with your project, some more information about it would be nice if you are able to elaborate it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>I am looking for <span class="bbcode-b">one</span> client developer and <span class="bbcode-b">one to three</span> model artists for an upcoming project of mine. The project is going to be a very innovative one which will attract a lot of publicity, will be unique and will be something that you can place on your portfolio. You will be compensated financially should the project receive any money.</p>
<p>Requirements for <span class="bbcode-b">client developer</span>:</p>
<p>[ul][li]You must have experience working with a team. This does not have to be a software development team, any examples of where you have successfully worked with a team will be considered.[/li]<br>
[li]You must have a strong programming background with Java experience.[/li]<br>
[li]You must have experience with version control systems, preferably Git.[/li]<br>
[li]You must have an understanding of the RuneScape client from a front-end perspective at least. You do not need to fully understand the mechanics behind it but understanding the client will make it a lot easier for you to work on it.[/li]<br>
[li]You must have an understanding of the code style in the <a href="https://github.com/Jameskmonger/317refactor" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">317refactor project</a>. This does not have to be an in-depth understanding however you must have read through the majority of the code.[/li]<br>
[li]You must have a can-do attitude. This is going to be a tough project however the rewards will be great when we complete the project.[/li]<br>
[li]Applicants with a portfolio of works will be strongly favoured. I will be particularly impressed if you can create something, however small, using the <a href="https://github.com/Jameskmonger/317refactor" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">317refactor project</a>. (Seriously, create something using the 317refactor project and you will be strongly considered against all other applicants.)[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Requirements for <span class="bbcode-b">model artist</span>:</p>
<p>[ul][li]You must have experience creating models in formats suitable for the 317 RuneScape client. This does not just include creating them in the correct file type but also being able to convert them into the correct type, animating the models and creating them with suitable polygon counts.[/li]<br>
[li]You must have experience working with a team. This does not have to be a software development team, any examples of where you have successfully worked with a team will be considered.[/li]<br>
[li]You must have a portfolio of models that you have created yourself.[/li]<br>
[li]You must be willing to learn whilst working. You will be required to take on a large amount of tasks, including creating the models, rigging the models and creating animations for them. You do not need to be able to do all of these as long as you are willing to learn.[/li]<br>
[li]You must be able to create models in a low-poly style similar to that of the 2005/2006 RuneScape style.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>All applicants must be able to dedicate at least 4 hours a week to work on the project. As I have stated, this project will attract a lot of publicity and will therefore be one that you can place on your portfolios in future.</p>
<p>If you are interested in applying, please send me a forum PM explaining which position you are applying for and how you meet the criteria listed above.</p>
