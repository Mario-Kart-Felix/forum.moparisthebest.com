          <blockquote>
              <p>There are two different things for hosting a website.<br>
You need a domain, and you need a website host.</p>
<p>A domain converts the website host IP into an easy-to-remember domain such as <a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">google.com</a>, so people don’t have to type in an IP such as 222.333.444.555.<br>
The website host is what actually hosts the files, and holds databases and other things to make the website run properly.<br>
I would recommend checking out <a href="http://arvixe.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Arvixe Website Hosting</a> gives you an easy to manage website host, and comes with a domain already linked. Also gives a nice control panel. It’s $7.00 USD/Month to host the website and the domain name is free for life when you buy the web host.</p>
<p>I would also recommend these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filezilla, for uploading the files to the website host so that people can view them.</li>
<li>Notepad++, used for editing website files (for more advanced users).</li>
</ul>
<p>Goodluck, if you want some help setting it up, I wouldn’t mind. Just private message me on the forums and I’ll check it ASAP.</p>
