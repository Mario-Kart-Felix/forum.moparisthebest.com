    <title>Ram Upgrade</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ram-upgrade/554706</link>
    <description>So I bought 4GB DDR2 800Mhz Ram and the one I was using was a 1GB DDR2 PC26400 533-666 Or something They&#39;re the same ram just the Mhz is different does that matter when I install it in my PC, Because my CPU says its 800Mhz and it was perfectly fine in the Mobo It just beeped until I put my old Ram back, My Old Ram was Single Channel, The new stuff was Dual channel does that matter? And did I buy the wrong stick?</description>

<p>You need to check whether your mother board and cpu support the new ram. If you can find their specifications online that should help you. Probably beeping because it doesn’t like your new ram. If anything I would suggest you save your money and either buy a pre build pc or buy the components your self and build one. The latter of the two is going to be cheaper depending on any deals that are currently going on.</p>

<p>It’s My motherboard I had the wrong Model no. Because I forgot I have Switched Mobo’s Like 3 times all the same Computer Different Boards, The one Im using now Supports up to 2gb Per Slot. 2 Slots for a total of 4Gb I shoould’ve Checked that before I bought it, Once I start working I’m gonna build a better one Not this CrapTastic Machine, Don’t get me wrong it’s been Damn good Ever since I bought it and put money it, Its like 7-8 Years old… But it plays Some Good games, I’m not going to say its a monster does what I need tho.</p>

<p>you should also check the bios for ram settings sometimes they add weird things like manually setting the MHZ instead of having it on auto and turning off channels.[/quote]</p>

              <p>It’s DDR2, so that makes it shit no matter what in this day in age.  Mixing ram, even by brand but especially by speed/size, is something people don’t normally suggest.</p>
