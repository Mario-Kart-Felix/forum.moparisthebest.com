    <title>You Are Not Worthy Of This Car</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/you-are-not-worthy-of-this-car/269785</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;[img]http://blog.wired.com/cars/images/2009/03/25/vulca01.jpg[/img]
This is the Vulca S. You probably won&#39;t ever see one, let alone drive one, because it&#39;s more exclusive than a VIP room at the Pink Elephant and you need an AIG bonus to afford one.

The Vulca S is the first car entirely designed and built by Italian coachbuilders Faralli &amp; Mazzanti. Just ten - that&#39;s right, ten - will be built, every one of them by hand over the course of 11 months. During that time, customers will stay at the coachbuilder&#39;s private villa in Tuscany so as to oversee every aspect of construction.

You know a car that rare will have some impressive hardware, and the Vulca - named for the Etruscan sculptor - does not disappoint.

According to F&amp;M, the Vulca gets a 5.8-liter V10 producing 630 horsepower. F&amp;M doesn&#39;t say who&#39;s making the engine, but BMW and Lamborghini make a ten-cylinder, though both displace less than 5.8 liters and so would have to be modified. Dodge makes one for the Viper, but it&#39;s a massive 8.4 liters. Motor Authority says the Vulca also could come with a V12 producing between 445 and 630 horsepower, depending upon how big an engine the customer orders.

Acceleration will be blistering, with a zero to 60 time of 3.9 seconds. F&amp;M promises a top speed somewhere north of 200 mph.

F&amp;M doesn&#39;t say anything more about the drivetrain, but the car rides on OZ Racing wheels and the interior is covered by a few acres of diamond-tufted leather. Carbon fiber and Alcantara is an option if you want a racier look. We don&#39;t see any gauges behind the steering wheel, so all the vital data must be displayed on one of the two LCD screens in the center of the dashboard - unless that&#39;s a heads-up display just to the left of the gargantuan hump in the middle of the dash.

The Tuscan coachbuilder was founded by race car driver Antonio Faralli, who was later joined by Rosello Mazzanti. The two men have been joined by their sons, and the firm  handcrafts every car. And by that we mean they&#39;re using hammers, wrenches and scissors to build these aluminum cars. This is true old-world craftsmanship.

F&amp;M started taking orders Wednesday. No word on the price, but as the joke goes, if you have to ask, you can&#39;t afford it.

This is the Vulca S. You probably won't ever see one, let alone drive one, because it's more exclusive than a VIP room at the Pink Elephant and you need an AIG bonus to afford one.
<p>The Vulca S is the first car entirely designed and built by Italian coachbuilders Faralli &amp; Mazzanti. Just ten - that’s right, ten - will be built, every one of them by hand over the course of 11 months. During that time, customers will stay at the coachbuilder’s private villa in Tuscany so as to oversee every aspect of construction.</p>
<p>You know a car that rare will have some impressive hardware, and the Vulca - named for the Etruscan sculptor - does not disappoint.</p>
<p>According to F&amp;M, the Vulca gets a 5.8-liter V10 producing 630 horsepower. F&amp;M doesn’t say who’s making the engine, but BMW and Lamborghini make a ten-cylinder, though both displace less than 5.8 liters and so would have to be modified. Dodge makes one for the Viper, but it’s a massive 8.4 liters. Motor Authority says the Vulca also could come with a V12 producing between 445 and 630 horsepower, depending upon how big an engine the customer orders.</p>
<p>Acceleration will be blistering, with a zero to 60 time of 3.9 seconds. F&amp;M promises a top speed somewhere north of 200 mph.</p>
<p>F&amp;M doesn’t say anything more about the drivetrain, but the car rides on OZ Racing wheels and the interior is covered by a few acres of diamond-tufted leather. Carbon fiber and Alcantara is an option if you want a racier look. We don’t see any gauges behind the steering wheel, so all the vital data must be displayed on one of the two LCD screens in the center of the dashboard - unless that’s a heads-up display just to the left of the gargantuan hump in the middle of the dash.</p>
<p>The Tuscan coachbuilder was founded by race car driver Antonio Faralli, who was later joined by Rosello Mazzanti. The two men have been joined by their sons, and the firm  handcrafts every car. And by that we mean they’re using hammers, wrenches and scissors to build these aluminum cars. This is true old-world craftsmanship.</p>
<p>F&amp;M started taking orders Wednesday. No word on the price, but as the joke goes, if you have to ask, you can’t afford it.<br>
