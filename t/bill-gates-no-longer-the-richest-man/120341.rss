    <description>Bill Gates no longer the richest man!

Article: http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070704/ts_afp/lifestylemexico
&lt;blockquote&gt;MEXICO CITY (AFP) - Mexican telecom tycoon Carlos Slim Helu has overtaken Microsoft founder Bill Gates as the richest person on the planet, the Mexican financial website Sentido Comun reported. 
 
Sentido Comun said the Mexican billionaire&#39;s wealth had rocketed past Gates following the red-hot performance of his telecommunications firm, America Movil.

US-based Forbes magazine, renowned for its rankings of the world&#39;s wealthiest individuals, updated its listings in April to rank Slim as the second richest individual in the world, as he bested the legendary US investor Warren Buffett.

The Mexican financial website said Slim&#39;s lead over Gates amounted to billions of dollars.

&quot;Thanks to a 26.5-percent rise in the shares of America Movil during the second quarter, Slim, who controls a 33-percent interest in Latin America&#39;s largest mobile phone company, is substantially richer than Gates,&quot; Sentido Comun said.

&quot;The difference between their two fortunes is around nine billion dollars in favor of Slim,&quot; the financial website claimed.

It said it had based its calculations largely on the share price movements of companies controlled by Slim.

The website said soaring performances from Slim&#39;s other business interests had also helped propel him past Gates.

Aside from America Movil, Slim controls the INBURSA financial group and the Grupo Carso industrial firm with interests spanning retail stores, coffee shops and restaurants.

One reason for Slim&#39;s meteoric rise might be because he is also still working.

Gates stepped aside as Microsoft chief in 2000 to devote his energies to the philanthropic foundation he runs with his wife, Melinda.

Forbes in April had pegged Slim&#39;s wealth at a staggering 53.1 billion dollars, and said Gates was sitting on a 56-billion-dollar fortune.

Slim, the son of Lebanese immigrants, has had business in his blood from his early days when he helped out in his father&#39;s shop, &quot;The Star of the Orient.&quot;

The 67-year-old started out in real estate and was already affluent enough when he graduated from university with an engineering degree to buy stakes in a stock brokerage and a bottling firm.

During the crippling Latin American economic crisis of the early 1980s, Slim snapped up and reformed a number of distressed businesses, banking massive profits for Grupo Carso.

Carso gained its name from the first three letters of Slim&#39;s name and the first two of his late wife&#39;s, Soumaya Gemayel.

Analysts say one of Slim&#39;s smartest and most lucrative deals occurred when he took control of Telefonos de Mexico (Telemex) in 1990 as the then government moved to privatize the sprawling monopoly.

Slim oversaw a 1.8-billion-dollar investment to take over Telemex, but he then overhauled the company and expanded its service as the telecom firm became the star of the Mexican stock exchange and more than returned Slim&#39;s initial investment. 

The Mexican billionaire has also made some savvy stock picks. 

In 1997, he bought about three percent of Apple Computer at 17 dollars a share shortly before the company launched its hit iMac computer. Twelve months later, Apple&#39;s shares topped 100 dollars. 

Despite his vast riches, Slim reportedly shuns corporate jets and flashy offices and sported a plastic watch during the 1990s. 

Widowed in 1999, Slim has boosted his philanthropic presence and overseen his three sons&#39; careers within his business empire. 

Like Gates, he has developed a strong profile on the philanthropic front. 

Earlier this month he allied himself with the foundation of former US president Bill Clinton and with Canadian mining magnate Frank Giustra to launch an anti-poverty campaign in Latin America. 

Fifty-three percent of Mexico&#39;s population of 104 million live in poverty, which is defined as living on less than two dollars a day, World Bank data show.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes it is true to minimize competition, but anihilating all together? That goes against anti-trust laws. 92% of the market? C’mon, that is definitely a monopoly. Remember when AT&amp;T had a monopoly? They broke that company up into 4 or 5 companies. But with MS, they didn’t.[/quote]<br>
There are plenty of companies in the world that have put someone smaller out of business. It’s certainly not just a Bill Gates thing.<br>
The only thing that Gates is guilty of is being a savvy investor.<br>
He may be the proud producer of the shittest OS in the world (which is arguable and highly opinion based), but he’s a success nonetheless.</p>

I don’t actually know the statistic, and cba’d to google, but I think that about 50% of the country is in poverty. As I understand it, there is really no middle class, you are either dirt poor, or swimming in pools of money.</p>
<p>I don’t agree with illegal aliens either, but they come here to work (for the most part, although there are a percentage that come here for illegal purposes.), and since the United States “road to citizenship” is so terrible, they figure “Hey, I can either wait around for a few years or I can just jump this fence…”.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Everyone</span> hating on Bill Gates:<br>
I don’t hate him nor love him, because I don’t know him. I have never meant him in real life, nor read enough about him to form a meaningful opinion. Him and a few others formed an extremely successful company, good for him.</p>

Yes it is true to minimize competition, but anihilating all together? That goes against anti-trust laws. 92% of the market? C'mon, that is definitely a monopoly. Remember when AT&amp;T had a monopoly? They broke that company up into 4 or 5 companies. But with MS, they didn't.

If Linux is so super (I'm not bagging it, I use it sometimes too), then why would you need WINE? If you have WINE, why would you need to dual boot? And if Windows dies on me, I can just reinstall the entire OS. So what's your point?
[/quote]
I need WINE, because since Microsoft is a monopoly, 99% of software is made for MS. So... if I wanted to play games like Rollercoaster Tycoon that I paid for, I would need MS to use it. Therefore, I can use WINE to use it. If MS wasn't a monopoly, I wouldn't need WINE. If there wasn't any monopoly on the operating systems, say it was split up, there would be a lot more applications including popular proprietary software for all operating systems.

Why is everyone so anti-Gates? It’s one thing to dislike the company (and I know a lot of people here do that just to fit in with those that prefer Linux), but hating someone for being successful just makes you look pathetic.<br>
Kudos to both guys for doing so well in the financial realm.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>People don’t hate Bill Gates because he’s successful. People hate Bill Gates because he is a dick. He has run so many companies out of business. He ran Netscape into the ground by including IE. He ran RealPlayer almost straight into the ground by packaging Windows Media Player. He even tried to have a monopoly on the BIOS but the judge ruled against it.</p>
<p>And do you even know why he is so rich? He leased DOS to IBM and got the right to change and modify it when everyone used DOS. That’s how he got his monopoly and his billions. From there, he just played sick games to get ahead. Look at it now. The worst OS ever, and it has a 92% or so of the computers everywhere. Without him, spyware/hackers would probably never exist.[/quote]<br>
Uhh, that’s life/business. Netscape would have done the same to its opponents, had it been given the chance. It’s only natural to try and minimize competition.</p>
