    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-host-a-server-why/430594</link>
    <description>Okay. I have portforwarded and made the no-ip host and downloaded the DUC. Also I changed the ip in my server. I did search name like &quot;server =&quot; and &quot;serverIP&quot;. And i found and replaced the ips. But when i chenge the ip of client I can&#39;t log in. And when I change it back to &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; it works again. So where is the problem?

Please help me. I really want to host my the first RSPS!</description>

<p>You have to set it to the no-ip, then turn that into a .rar file, and upload it somewhere. That’s how other people play it, but if you want to play it change the one on your desktop back to the 127.0.0.1, and give other people the link where you uploaded it to, try mediafire.</p>

              <p>Try don’t using No-IP and using your real IP. Also do you run on a router or a LAN-cable? If you’re running on a LAN cable, you don’t have to portforward, however if you do run on a router you portforwarded wrong.</p>
