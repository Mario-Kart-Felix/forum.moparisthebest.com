Rune-World anti leech fixed

I&#39;m tired of seeing topics about this in the server help section so here .

The so called &#39;anti - leech&#39; could hardly be considered an anti leech as it was a missing bracket under a break statement on case 13405: and a packaging problem, I have no clue where he got the missing transient variable part from, but there was nothing missing. 


The server it&#39;s self has all of the original content nothing was touched, the only thing that was modified was the anti leech.


If you get a path not specified error, simply right click the run batch file and change this jdk1.6.0_## to whatever version of java you have. Also, if you&#39;re running a 64-bit pc you will need to make a modification to this /Program Files/ You just need to add a (x86) at the end. Enjoy

This doesn&#39;t have the client, just the server.

EDIT:
Okay, since I&#39;ve already got a million pms about the client I uploaded it.

http://uppit.com/qs11qndvwevt/Rune-World_Client.rar

To change the IP simply go into client class (client.java) and search for the string server = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;.</description>
