    <title>Pokemon MMO</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pokemon-mmo/437961</link>
    <description>So, I&#39;m planning on making a Pokemon MMO. What I&#39;m most curious of is whether or not the community would be interested in something like this, and if there could be any legal repercussions (using their sprites, &quot;Pokemon&quot;, etc).

I&#39;d be happy to share more details about the project if you&#39;d like.</description>

Just use the same system. I’ve made ROM Hacking tools that can edit Pokemon Red, Blue, Gold, and Silver if you want to look at how maps are made. <a href="http://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=238450" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">ClassicMap</a> <a href="http://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=232830" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">JohtoMap</a></p>
<p>Moderators: I don’t mean to advertise by any means. However, I’m not sure if he knows what ROM Hacking is or what I’m talking about, so I figured I’d link him to the original topics for each program which includes actual details about them. Don’t hurt me!</p>

              <p>That’s why there was a few changes to my design. Instead of it being a “Pokemon” game per se, a more appropriate description would be “Pokemon style” game. How I have it right now, is that the owners of the server can create their own maps, creatures and story-line. Similar mechanics as the Pokemon games. Of course, I would start off with the original pokemon (sprites, abilities, stories, etc) and if I get any notices or things like that, I would simply remove them. It wouldn’t be a big deal, because it would be community driven, and I know there are some very creative people out there (either storyline, map creation, or art).</p>
