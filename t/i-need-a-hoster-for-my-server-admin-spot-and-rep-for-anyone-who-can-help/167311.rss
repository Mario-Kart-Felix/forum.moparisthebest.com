    <title>I need a hoster for my server, admin spot and rep++ for anyone who can help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-a-hoster-for-my-server-admin-spot-and-rep-for-anyone-who-can-help/167311</link>
    <description>Well, I have been working on my server, The Twilight Zone, for a bit, and I can&#39;t get No-ip to work, and I don&#39;t want to use Hamachi.

I was hoping someone could host my sever for me, I just need you to have a relatively fast computer, and the ability to set up a no-ip. I will give you an admin spot on my server and Rep++ you if you can help.

Thanks,
~Teh_Hacker</description>

              <p>Thank you J-bird, I have pmed you the hamachi info for the server so you can check it out. Pm me back if you’re interested.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t have an MSN, so I will have to transfer files over Hamachi</p>
