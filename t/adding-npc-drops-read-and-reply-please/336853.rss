    <title>Adding npc drops - read and reply please!-</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-npc-drops-read-and-reply-please/336853</link>
    <description>I am trying to add npc drops, I have tried it in &quot;Npcdrops.cfg&quot; I did it all right, however it won&#39;t drop. I heard that most servers load up the npc drops in a different file. Which file is this? If you can please tell me how to make the drops. All I am really asking for is what file its located in.

If it is in a .class file, please tell me what program to open it with.
Thank you!</description>

              <p>Drops are loaded in NPCHandler.java<br>
To add a drop add a line like this, fill in the words with the correct numbers</p>
<p>npcdrop = NPCID        ITEMID        AMOUNT        FREQUENCY(%)</p>
<p>I highly suggest you commit that to memory and do not copy and paste into your cfg file as I used spaces not the tab bar.</p>
