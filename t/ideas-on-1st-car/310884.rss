    <title>Ideas on 1st car?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ideas-on-1st-car/310884</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve finally got round to starting to drive, and seeing as my parents both have big, automatic BMW&#39;s I don&#39;t have a car I can use outside of lessons. I&#39;m looking for a car thats going to cost less than £1000 second hand, is reliable, isn&#39;t going to cost a shit load to insure, and isn&#39;t stupidly slow. I&#39;m aiming to get a 1.4l engine, but 1.2&#39;s are fine. My initial idea was to get an old Ford Focus or Fiesta, but I really want something a little bit different.

Has anyone got any ideas for a good, reliable first car?</description>

after all this time, I ended up settling for a Vauxhall Corsa 1.2l. It’s 15 years old, with 100,000 miles on the clock, but it is in excellent condition with only 1 previous lady owner. Only £450 which was cheap and cheerful!<br>

<p>11000KM a year is not a seriously used car, more like 60000km a year. 30000 a year is average.</p>

<p>For you go with the Fiesta, although I have never seen/heard of one. But you gotta love the British  cars. Lol<br>
[/quote]Pontiac’s aren’t reliable.[/quote]</p>
<p>Don’t know where that came from, srt8’s 1996 Pontiac Grand Am gets 32mpg and has 135,000 miles on it with very few problems ever.  Also, though my S10 is a Chevy (Chevy and Pontiac are both GM), it had 314,000 miles on it before the original 4.3 V6 blew, I put another engine it it and still drive it to this day.</p>
<p>Bottom line, they are very reliable.</p>

<p>Oh ok. That’s only $100 more than I’m paying each year then. I’m a secondary driver (and I’ll probably keep it that way for a few more years), despite being the only person that drives the car. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>i think a 24pack of pint sized heinekens is around $40 or $50 here in canada… <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>about $300 a month insurance if you’ve just got your license[/quote]<br>
$300 a month is incredible. $3600 in a 12 month period covers what exactly? My car was $6500, and I couldn’t fathom paying half of its value for insurance in just 12 months when I’m a good driver.</p>
<p>Sounds like your alcohol/beer pricing is on par with Australia’s. I just wanted to know if our government was staying in line with the rest of the world or going way overboard with taxing us.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/r.i.p">@R.I.P</a>: I’d say they’re normal. Maybe a few dollars dearer than stuff like Carlton Draught and the like, but $10 cheaper than a case of coronas. Europe has really cheap grog. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
