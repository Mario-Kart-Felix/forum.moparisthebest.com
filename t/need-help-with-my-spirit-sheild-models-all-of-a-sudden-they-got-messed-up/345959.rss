    <description>Okay, so I was adding the Staff of Light to my server, and when I added the models and the Ints, it worked and stuff for the Staff but then I noticed all my spirit shields except the Elysian Shield got fucked up and the inv modes look like fucked up 99 str capes and range capes. So then I deleted all of the Staff of Light models and Invs tinking maybe they were clashing or something, but my shields are messed up except one, can anybody explain this please?</description>
