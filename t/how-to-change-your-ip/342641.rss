<p>i no that, im saying for people to connect to my server instead of connect to 70.53… ect they can connect to insanityscap.no-ip.bix because the 70.53… will change like every month</p>
<p>If you’re trying to connect to a server, running on your machine, and you’re trying to connect to it, on your machine, you MUST set the IP to 127.0.0.1. If the server is hosted elsewhere, you put the no-ip address.<br>

<p>No it wont. Not if you use the No-IP DUC on the machine that’s running the server…</p>
