    <title>LightRune V2_</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lightrune-v2-/448179</link>
    <description>Well, I went into the download section today, and saw a sexy, amazing base called LightRune, mixed in with all the 600+ bullshit. Anyway, I decided, &quot;Why not work on it a bit?&quot; So alas, LightRune V2_ was born! I plan on releasing little content packs. And in these packs, there will be big and little improvements. From stability enhancements to skills and mini games. But that is WAY far ahead. Now for the progress thread.

Update Log:

[code]
-Downloaded Source
-Started working on a base for NPC&#39;s and commands
[/code]

Pictures:

None yet.
