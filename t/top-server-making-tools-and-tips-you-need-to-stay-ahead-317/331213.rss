[size=12pt]Port forwarding with utorrent is another way to port forward but this tool can also be uses for other things like cheeking the speed of your computer and downloading other files online.

[/size]

[size=14pt] [Easy] Simple protection[/size]

[size=12pt]The most simple way to keep your files safe is to delete all the .java files and the compiler in your client before you send it out for others to use. This way you can keep the size of the client down so people have less time before they get it from a download and its harder for people to get and use the client for there sorce. Just make sure you keep a back up of the client just for you so you can still edit it.[/size]

[size=14pt] [Easy] .Bat to .Exe maker[/size]

[IMG]http://i45.tinypic.com/2ahtsu8.jpg[/img]

[size=12pt]This is mostly to make your server look more professional. This takes your weird looking .bat files like your run.bat file and turns it into a non editable simple version of it. This also keeps people from messing stuff up.

[size=14pt] [Easy] Hiding files[/size]

[size=12pt]Before you do this make sure that you made it so you can see hidden files by going into your client folders and clicking tools and opening up the folder options. From there go to view and select show hidden files.[/size]

[size=12pt]After doing that now you can hide all the files so it looks more clean and provides a basic defense agents client stealing. To do this select all the files in your client except the Run.exe or what ever you named it and then right click and go to properties and click to apply the files as hidden. Many people will say this is very simple and it is but it still needs to be done cause some defense is better then no defense. [/size]
