    <title>Please Explain How Injection/Reflection Bots work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/please-explain-how-injection-reflection-bots-work/533691</link>
    <description>Be as detailed but also as concise as you can, state it in a way anyone (noobs) could understand.

I&#39;m assuming all java bots use one of these two methods (PowreBot, EpicBot, TriBot, OSBot, etc.)

If any of them use some other method or some other special techniques that you know of please include that too.

Thanks!</description>

              <p>Injection bots, basically, create accessor methods for variables/methods that’d normally be private or inaccessible outside of the class in which those components are contained.  There’s more to it in regards to avoiding detection, etc. but that’s the jist.  I can’t be any more detailed for the same reason Rodger cannot.</p>

              <p>Injection bots inject into the RuneScape applet, reading the game’s code directly to determine what is what. Reflection bots create a mirror image of the RuneScape applet by accessing the loaded classes and then read the code of the “reflected” copy, without injecting any code.</p>
<p>There are plenty of examples around these parts which will introduce yourself to bcel. I have barely touched bcel or reflection so I have no business explaining but I do know the concept or each.</p>
