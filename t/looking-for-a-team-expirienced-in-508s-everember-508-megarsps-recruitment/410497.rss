    <description>I have a rsps that is a 508 and its been a success, yet, i need a team willing to work for no pay tempporaraly. So far every one who plays loves it but says there are issues. I need a team. I need a person who can java script, and someone who can make custom models and set them up. So far its been a 3 person team, me, the developer/scripter/modeler but i cant do everything alone, i need help! I have a hoster, but it has been lousy, we are gonna get donations so he will be co-owner but no longer hoster. We also have an admin who looks after the community and bans hackers! So if you can script and can assist me or know how to work with custom models. Go to [url=http://www.everember.webs.com/]Home -[/url] to see it and pm me if you want to join. If you are a scripter i will make you lead scripter if you pass a test and i will pay you when we get the server up and going. All i need is for some one to help me with 6 issues, thats it. 2 easy, 2medium issues, and 2 hard ones. I need the modeler to put in future items/models from versions like 614 into the game such as colored whips and some new armor and items. PLEASE REPLY AND HELP ME! ALSO IF THIS IS IN THE WRONG SECTION PlEASE TELL ME WHAT SECTION IT BELONGS IN!</description>
