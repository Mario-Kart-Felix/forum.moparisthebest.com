    <description>Eminem, Has Retired!


Eminem ... Slim has hung up his mic to concentrate on being a dad
 
EMINEM has bowed out of public life completely — after suddenly cancelling a string of UK dates.

He is giving up his solo career to concentrate on being a dad to daughter Hailie, eight.

The hip-hop star, 32, yesterday axed his European Anger Management Tour, claiming “exhaustion”.

Eminem — real name Marshal Mathers — was due to appear in Milton Keynes, Edinburgh and Manchester next month.

He was expected to perform to 330,000 people in Britain alone.

Eminem is estimated to be losing £10million in ticket receipts from UK fans and millions more in lost revenue from merchandise and album sales.

 He has no plans to reschedule the concerts because he has retired, confidantes say.

Eminem’s people insist he is not ill. They say after two months on the road in America he is so worn out he is unable to continue to Europe.

A source said: “He was already set to kill off the solo rap character he’d created. He’s wanted to bow out for some time.

“He hoped to retire after the tour. But his exhaustion has forced him to do it now.”</description>
