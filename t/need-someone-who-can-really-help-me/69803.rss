    <title>Need someone who can really help me</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-someone-who-can-really-help-me/69803</link>
    <description>OK i got Moparscape with Aryan and all that. I got Hamachi also. When I go to the advirtising board to try to find a good server and find one, I press file in moparscape 3.2 and press new server and enter that persons server ID. Once that is done, I always try to log in and it gives me a message saying that the server is in timed out or something like that. I&#39;ve tried this like 5 differant times now and it keeps happening. Am I doing something wrong? If I am, please take the time to explain to me how to do this. Thank you!</description>

              <p>Where do I switch the port?[br][size=1]Posted on: March 22, 2007, 02:50:05 PM[/size][hr]NVM I figured out how to do this. I got another question now. I found the server I want to go on. I switched the server ID to the server I want and the port to the port I want. Do I still log in with any usename and pass? If I do, I tried and it said that there was an error connection and the site must be down then it told me to create my own.</p>

              <p>Your probably putting too many spaces in the server IP. If you copied any pasted, and you selected too much when you pasted, there will be extra spaces in there. Also make sure you have the right port.</p>
