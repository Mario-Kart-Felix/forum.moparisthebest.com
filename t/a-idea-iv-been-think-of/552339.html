<p>When you train magic you get 99 most of the time just to have the cape or to use ice barrage.</p>
<p>Instead of every spell being unlocked what if you had to kill npcs until they dropped a scroll then you would have to talk to mages around the world and they would teach you that spell.</p>
<p>Example:<br>
Spell - Ice Barrage<br>
Npc - Frost Dragon<br>
How to receive drop - You would have to kill the Frost Dragon with Ice Arrows (Made from Unlocking Enchanting Spell)<br>
To learn Spell (Single) - Go to Ice mountain and talk to the Ice Mage at the top<br>
JUST ANOTHER IDEA BELOW<br>
To learn Spell (Multi) - Receive Multi Scroll from Frost dragon after using Ice Barrage on them and 500 Npc Kills (Cant be Used in PVP)</p>
<p>Would this make Rsps more intersting or would you hate this??</p>

<p>Tweaking the requirements a bit would probably help. You could make it a random drop from certain enemies; but it should be reasonable for the enemy to have that type of scroll. Doesn’t make sense for a firebat to have an ice barrage scroll.</p>
<p>With that in mind, you’ll have to change the protocol a bit (possibly). You’ll almost certainly need to add metadata handling for items (when you pick up a scroll, what type of spell does it teach?) and having a new item definition for each type of spell is a terrible idea.</p>

<p>That was just an Example If I was to add it, I would make most Frost Npcs have the chance of the drop just frost dragon would have biggest chance with it being the strongest Frost Npc. I would need help with this, Im working on a project to better my knowledge of java but Im still learning the basics, figured if I get a decent amount of knowledge and released a Rsps It would need some stuff that would make it stand out. Also the High Alch isnt used anymore that I have seen so I would add a Scroll for that and make alching a way of making money when your out grinding npcs or such for that one item you want. I was just seeing how people would like the idea to see if it would be worth my time to learn how to add it.</p>
<p>Also I wouldnt do every skill most would still be unlocked via Leveling but the high level damage spells and Enchanting Spells, Alch… ECT would require a scroll.</p>
