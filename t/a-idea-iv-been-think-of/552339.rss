    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-idea-iv-been-think-of/552339</link>
    <description>So I was thinking of a idea to make magic more interesting

When you train magic you get 99 most of the time just to have the cape or to use ice barrage.

Instead of every spell being unlocked what if you had to kill npcs until they dropped a scroll then you would have to talk to mages around the world and they would teach you that spell.

Example:
Spell - Ice Barrage
Npc - Frost Dragon
How to receive drop - You would have to kill the Frost Dragon with Ice Arrows (Made from Unlocking Enchanting Spell)
To learn Spell (Single) - Go to Ice mountain and talk to the Ice Mage at the top
JUST ANOTHER IDEA BELOW
To learn Spell (Multi) - Receive Multi Scroll from Frost dragon after using Ice Barrage on them and 500 Npc Kills (Cant be Used in PVP) 

Would this make Rsps more intersting or would you hate this??</description>

<p>That was just an Example If I was to add it, I would make most Frost Npcs have the chance of the drop just frost dragon would have biggest chance with it being the strongest Frost Npc. I would need help with this, Im working on a project to better my knowledge of java but Im still learning the basics, figured if I get a decent amount of knowledge and released a Rsps It would need some stuff that would make it stand out. Also the High Alch isnt used anymore that I have seen so I would add a Scroll for that and make alching a way of making money when your out grinding npcs or such for that one item you want. I was just seeing how people would like the idea to see if it would be worth my time to learn how to add it.</p>
<p>Also I wouldnt do every skill most would still be unlocked via Leveling but the high level damage spells and Enchanting Spells, Alch… ECT would require a scroll.</p>
