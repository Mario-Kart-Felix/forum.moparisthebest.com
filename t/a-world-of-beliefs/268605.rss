    <title>A World of Beliefs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-world-of-beliefs/268605</link>
    <description>I started this just today and I felt like sharing chapter 1 with you for some feedback. This book is entitled [i]A World of Beliefs[/i] and is created to formulate all my ideas regarding anything connected with beliefs in the common world. I don&#39;t know how long this book is going to be, but hopefully it will cover every angle that someone can view it from, as that&#39;s really what the book&#39;s all about.

So, if you are at all interested, please read and comment.
