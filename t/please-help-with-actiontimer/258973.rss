    <description>hello guys.
first of all, i got a old source, jordiescape.
on jordiescape you can mass attack and mass eat, well you can mass.
example? ok, the timer is not that useful, you can put a attack timer of 8 and your players will still can attack before it,
just by clicking again on the enemy...
SOOO...
i need a way to add food timer and attack timer or something, that can stop that mass.
please somebody help me, i&#39;ve been trying for a long time, but got no idea about what that code is named.
and about how to set it, how to make the timers really work, i mean... you click many times at enemy and it wont change your attack speed, you will still respecting the timer... same for food... please help... thanks.</description>

              <p>ok, let me ask again… does anyone here realy know how to help?i mean, how to set a true attack timer that doesnt allow you to mass at enemy.<br>
i think theres something wrong with the attack timer case and i have no idea if i can use action timer for that,as i did for food… in anyway i just need to set a timer that works, if anyone has a server with working timer i think post the code of it and a weapon as example will solve…thanks and sorry, i just hate people who tell to change source cause they aways do shit.</p>

<p>reaper, if u read i said i solve that… i just cant set attack timer… you can still click at your enemy before the timer ends, you can mass click at enemy and mass atk and also i think when people just have no idea about what to say or how to help, they should just keep quiet else of come here and flood, just that.</p>

<li>If the reason you think I’m mad is because I have that small green dot by my name then you’re an even bigger tard than I thought. I’m currently mad because of the way douche bags like you respond when people are trying to help you. If you don’t like the people in this community then you can click that arrow pointing to the left at the top of your screen a few times because there’s no room in this community for ass monkeys. And about me not having any respect, well boy I’ll trace your ip, sharpie on the back of my hand “respect”, then slap you in the face and make you cry son.</li>
<li>Nobody is forcing you to switch sources, he was simply suggesting it so you don’t need to tell him to shut up, you can simply ignore his comment and move on.</li>
<li>I haven’t tried to help you because, honestly, I don’t think you even deserve help.</li>
<li>Why don’t you attempt to fix your problem yourself before crawling to these forums looking like you don’t know a damn thing in the world about coding… And you probably even don’t.</li>
<li>Nice grammer, you’re a fail.</li>
<li>You know all of the above is true</li>
<li>Have a fan-damn-tastic day son.</li>

              <p>hello guys.<br>
first of all, i got a old source, jordiescape.<br>
on jordiescape you can mass attack and mass eat, well you can mass.<br>
example? ok, the timer is not that useful, you can put a attack timer of 8 and your players will still can attack before it,<br>
just by clicking again on the enemy…<br>
SOOO…<br>
i need a way to add food timer and attack timer or something, that can stop that mass.<br>
please somebody help me, i’ve been trying for a long time, but got no idea about what that code is named.<br>
and about how to set it, how to make the timers really work, i mean… you click many times at enemy and it wont change your attack speed, you will still respecting the timer… same for food… please help… thanks.</p>
