    <title>Banned From School Computers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/banned-from-school-computers/334782</link>
    <description>Last Friday I was looking threw my computers BIOS at school, when the teacher turned and saw what I was looking at - he asked what I was doing and I replayed &quot;just looking at the BIOS, i&#39;ve always wondered what was inside this&quot;, he then yelled &quot;I know what you are doing get out!&quot;. (note I have 2 computer class&#39;s) I came back Monday to find out I can no longer use school computers as my account is disabled. I&#39;ve tried talking with my Principal about this issue but he insists I was &quot;hacking&quot; and breaking the school&#39;s computer usage policy.

Now i&#39;ve looked over the policy yet I don&#39;t see what he is talking about. I am going to fail both of these class&#39;s and have to take makeup class&#39;s next year to graduate (I am a junior). 

Do you think I should have been banned from them?

tl;dr I got banned from my school computer for looking at the BIOS

Pic related - its the policy.

<p>To both, the BIOS is password no harm can be done without the password. I can see what is happening but I cannot change anything in it. The IT guy should be back in school today, so I will see what happens and i’ll be back at 2 o’clock EST with what he says.</p>
<p>He says he can’t do anything or even side with me though I could do NO harm to the computer as the BIOS has a password…</p>

<p>I’ve been banned from the computers before, I suggest you write a letter to the adult that punished you. Make sure you note that you understand you’ve done something wrong, you’ll never do it again, and how much your grade depends on computers in the two classes you mentioned.</p>
<p>Better yet, write a letter and talk to them in person  :rolleyes:</p>

              <p>Cumescape lol this is so stupid honestly. This is about as bad as me getting ISS (In School Suspension) for downloading games, when all did was play a game someone else installed.

<p>Fuck the superintendent go to the Board of Education. Also get your parents involved. When I was falsely accused of compute crimes at school I was living with my grand parents and they don’t even know how to turn on a computer.</p>
<p>Also in your argument with your monkey superiors bring up the fact that if anyone hits a certain key in bootup they will access the BIOS.</p>

<p>Well if you stretch it enough, the BIOS could be classified as “Configuration” because you can “configure” which drives boot first, and all the other shit you can do with it.</p>
