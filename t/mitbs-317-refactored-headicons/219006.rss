    <title>Mitb&#39;s 317 refactored - headIcons?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mitbs-317-refactored-headicons/219006</link>
    <description>I see his refactored has headIcons, but does it load them and show them correctly? Because server sided I am sending them correctly - but they are not showing ?
Also - 377 cache.

server side, obviously:
[code]
playerProps.writeByte(p.headIcon); // headicon.
[/code]

The client reads them fine and in order.. and checks if it isnt 0, and if it isnt 0 then it draws the headIcon.

headIcon is set to 1 when the player logs in (for testing), also updateRequired and appearanceUpdateRequired flags [i]are[/i] being called, yes.</description>
