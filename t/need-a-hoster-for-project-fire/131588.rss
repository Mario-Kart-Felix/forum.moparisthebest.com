    <title>Need a hoster for Project Fire</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-hoster-for-project-fire/131588</link>
    <description>Hello I need a host for my new server Project Fire.

The server is based around Relleka. There is full woodcutting/fishing/smithing/mining/fletching/herblore/thieving/range/mage.
I have added a dungeon that is highly edited. It has 4 bosses inside it that drop good items. None of the monsters will respawn until all of them will be killed, some of the monsters will require a team to kill. There is much more, if you are interested post here or add my MSN: i-noodle@hotmail.com.</description>
