    <title>How to embed client on web page?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-embed-client-on-web-page/236623</link>
    <description>I have made my server and its running fine, but is there a way to embed it onto the webpage (like moparscape have) and let my players play from there. Would i have to do it by using asp? Any help will be appreciated because i really dont have a clue how to do it. If i have posted this in the worng place dont have a go at me, im new to moparscape.

Thanks :)[br][br][size=1]Posted on: October 14, 2008, 09:25:17 am[/size][hr]Im going to post this in the Moparscape Client Questions topic i think thats the right place for it</description>
