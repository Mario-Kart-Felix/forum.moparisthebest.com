<p>The ags guy was cut by me, FUCKING ME! i got it from zybez community by looking through the character thread and picked that dude, then cutted him and used him as a sprite. And Tonic i can’t believe you did this, wow…</p>
<p>Isn’t leeching from r00n-serba enough?<br>
And now you claim something someone cut off as yours?</p>
<p>Proof if you guys don’t believe me, empirescape v2 has those dudes, also here’s the project file i still have:<br>

<p>Oh btw gtfo Ranger Squad plz go suck a dick[/quote]Well a good coder like Mitko would know that it takes alot of time to make that… Mayby not but it’s HIS creation and i think he doesn’t want kids to steal it for release so it isn’t special anymore? Right niQQa??? Well anyway i think you are the 95% wich can’t code <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

This is like saying credits for the client goes to blah blah blah, but actually 100% credits go to Jagex and not the dude that released the client with his source.<br>
In this case, i cut the characters, I was the first to release them on the client with a working interface. You can say that credtis go to Jagex for the character… but this is rsps so the <span class="bbcode-b">ORIGINAL</span> “creator” of these 2 sprites that cut them and used them on an interface is me.</p>
<p>I’m done with this shit, agree or don’t i’m not dealing with this anymore. I’m out of this thread.</p>
<p>EDIT: Ooh, what’s that i see?<br>
The blank button i used paint to put text “Click here to play” on it.</p>
