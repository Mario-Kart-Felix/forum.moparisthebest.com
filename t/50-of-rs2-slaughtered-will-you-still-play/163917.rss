    <title>50% of RS2 Slaughtered; Will you still play?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/50-of-rs2-slaughtered-will-you-still-play/163917</link>
    <description>Alright, so now Jagex has really done it. They have done what 80% of the RuneScape community was praying for not to happen.

Here&#39;s a list of what they have done and what a lot of people think was a big mistake:


[ul][li]Added Assist System
[/li][li]Nearly Removed All of Staking; Replaced With 3k Staking Cap
[list][li]Giving F2p what they want (Duel arena), while taking away what P2p loves (wildy, tele-block, etc.)
[/li][li]Added Grand Exchange (I love it, but a lot of other people don&#39;t)
[list][li]Removed 99.9% of the Wilderness, now leaving it as more of a &quot;Dark Forest full of Ghosts that Randomly Attack You&quot; aka: a Place for Noobs to Hang Out
[/li][li]Removed item dropping (killing both team looting in boss fights and mainly the beloved PKing)
[list][li]GOING to remove imbalanced trades (Say goodbye to loans from friends! Plus potion sharing, etc.)
[/list]

That&#39;s only some of it.

Now here&#39;s some things that will be replacing the classical features:

[list]
[li]LootShare (well, now that you can&#39;t split D-chain drops anymore, you&#39;ve just gotta pray that LootShare will get one for you)
[/li][li]The Grand Exchange (merchanting is going to be nearly completely dead after the new trade system is relesed)
[list][li]Bounty-Hunter (in replacement of PKing. Seems like a good idea, but think hard: Pures and lower level PKers wont stand much of a chance; IMO)
[/li][li]Gravestones (Hurry, Run, Run!! Quickly, before your items don&#39;t appear for noobs to grab, but are DESTROYED!!)
[list][li]Some Ghost Crap (Yay for, uhh, Drag dagger drops that are only worth 20k!! Or maybe a clue scroll... That&#39;s if you DON&#39;T get raped by them)
[/li][li]SUMMONING!! (YAY for Summoning!! -- It&#39;s all just to distract you from how good the game used to be...)
[/list]

Well, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for now.

So, what do you think of the game now? Will you still play it to kill time, be a hardcore fan, or just to become a bounty-hunter and own some noobs (and about that: prepare to see lots of pures named &quot;Dog the bounty hunter&quot; or some crap like that, lol), or just give up and move onto a real game like Counter-Strike.

I&#39;m still going to play because a game is a game and I love all games. It&#39;ll just take some time to adjust to this new enviorment, but I say it&#39;ll be worth it (to either see the rise of the game, or it&#39;s downfall).

Cheers,
 ~Dizzy  :cool:[/list][/list][/list][/list][/ul]</description>

<p>Those rumors are not true. Instead, they would probably fix Bounty Hunter to make sure groups/clans do not get an unfair advantage in the game. I say they need to make 2 seperate areas for every cave difficulty. One for 1 on 1 fighting and the other for multi-combat (either to be used by clans, or any other group PKing).[/quote]<br>
well anyway if they don’t thell lose ALL of their members and free players<br>
and why the hell did they add servers when loosing players</p>
