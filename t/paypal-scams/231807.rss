    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/paypal-scams/231807</link>
    <description>Ok, well i hear a lot about paypal favor the buyer always, and pretty much fuck over the sellers (in a virtual items case)

a game called Conquer online have an item shop (cash shop) and well im thinking of spending 200$ on shit, then making a dispute and say i never made that transaction (aparently they have to refund your money) then the game conpany will pretty much try track my accounts/items down and ban, but not if i play my cards right. i think i can benefit and evade the penalty. (for example, using an internet cafe when i order the shit, ordering it on newb characters, selling the items for money, dropping the money and picking it up on a diff char thats never touched the ip of the internet cafe one.

would this work or not?</description>

But doesn’t the fact that I did it in the US have anything to do with it? Or can I just scam all foreign countries for thousands of dollars with no consequences?<br>
[/quote]<br>
That will get consequences, scaming is not legal in US or most of the country in the world. (Maybe legal in Netherland, but I don’t know)[/quote]</p>
<p>Haha, how the hell would scamming be legal in the Netherlands?</p>

<p>No, it’s because if the company is based in a country where it isn’t illegal to do so, then American law has nothing to do with it(I thought that would be pretty obvious).</p>

You have forgotten the American law system, small things can cost you much money.<br>
Like when you download some songs it can fast be a couple of 10000$ you must pay (If RIAA finds out.).</p>

That rigth, and Conquer online will not be hurt in this case if xEnt says he never did the transaction, then there is Paypal or his bank that must pay back, if they belive him.</p>

              <p>[quote=“xEnt, post:1, topic:231807”]Ok, well i hear a lot about paypal favor the buyer always, and pretty much fuck over the sellers (in a virtual items case)</p>
<p>a game called Conquer online have an item shop (cash shop) and well im thinking of spending 200$ on shit, then making a dispute and say i never made that transaction (aparently they have to refund your money) then the game conpany will pretty much try track my accounts/items down and ban, but not if i play my cards right. i think i can benefit and evade the penalty. (for example, using an internet cafe when i order the shit, ordering it on newb characters, selling the items for money, dropping the money and picking it up on a diff char thats never touched the ip of the internet cafe one.</p>
<p>would this work or not?[/quote]</p>
<p>This idea is not new… its been used for ages in many many mmorpgs… it works and yes you could get away with it without even using internet cafes just use a proxy. Paypal also has a very bad system… as long as you got a credit card or bank account on paypal no matter if paypal has 0.00$ on your balance… it will just go negative and if you don’t own the paypal you shouldn’t care…</p>
<p>Now the trick with getting away with it… is not just transferring from newb chars over to main that got me banned… but I figured out a way to trick the system but it requires EXTREME amount of trust… in a game I played we had a guild/clan/squadron/team thing. We would just drop the item and pick it up on different accounts (trades were logged and are logged in many games…) but whats the chances of logging items that are dropped that would be a extremely huge log file. Anyways yah just kept dropping and picking up on different accounts the gamemasters of the game right away would just been like ah this refunder must of sold it already to some legit players… no point in taking it away from a legit player… he will complain he lost a item he payed game money for… so the whole thing is flawed like that…</p>
<p>I got banned cuz when I figured out the system works by just clicking checkout button… I did it over 100 times charging the company 5000$ or more… they obviously had to pay back some huge fees and they were really pissed off… I had a shit load of exp cards and the game had shared banks… so I shared with a few friends… I transfered over the shit to random banks… and still only i got banned cuz of my ip… didn’t know about ips back then.</p>
<p>Also one huge flaw… when you login your noob your ip will get logged and your main will instantly get banned later… to proxy exe games you gotta use a vps they could be remote assistance or vnc but you gotta download the game on them so make sure its a fast VPS.</p>
<p>You could proxy games without vps using freecaps… but it only works on some games not all… those that got hack protection game guards u cant use it on that… freecaps uses proxies u find on google http ones to change ur ip.</p>
<p>But well u could go to hell for doing this… lol thats about the only downside to this method.</p>
