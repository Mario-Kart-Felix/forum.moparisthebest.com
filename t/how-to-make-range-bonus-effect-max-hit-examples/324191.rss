difficulty: 0/10 (just learning)

[b]IM SORRY IF I DONT MAKE SENCE TO YOU.[/b]

well this is my first tut EVER and i thought i would share something that frustrauted me for the longest time and i figured it out finally. 
most people working on 317s that havent fixed ranged may need this. as for my source is pimpscape so i really needed this information when i started creating this server

Okay so while i was trying to figure out the whole ranging system out i stumbled onto 
[code]if(UseBow){[/code]
.
while on here i noticed the code looked like so:
[code]        if (UseBow) {
            inCombat();
            teleportToX = absX;   
            teleportToY = absY; 
            CheckArrows();
            CalculateRange();
hitDiff = 0 + misc.random(25);
} [/code]


now i was breaking it down and im probably guessing wrong but ill explain how i think this works.
this:

[code]if (UseBow) {[/code]

i think would be saying if the bow effect/item is needed it calls on the rest of these items listed.


 [code]inCombat();[/code]

well this would lead you into the void inCombat if you have it.

[code]            teleportToX = absX;   
            teleportToY = absY; [/code]

im guessing this means that it will hit from a distance

.
            [code]CheckArrows();[/code]

would lead you to the check arrows void making sure you have arrows in quiver to shoot.

[code]CalculateRange();[/code]

this has the MOST to do with range bonuses effecting how high you hit.(other then the hitdiff and random shown legend made this.)
[code]    public void CalculateRange() {
        double MaxHit = 0;
        int RangeBonus = playerBonus[4]; // Range Bonus
        int Range = playerLevel[4]; // Range
        {
            MaxHit += (double) (1.05
                    + (double) ((double) (RangeBonus * Range) * 2.00175));
        } 
MaxHit += (double)(Range * 0.4);
        playerMaxHit = (int) Math.floor(MaxHit);
    }[/code]

this code:
[code]2.00175[/code]

is the one i have found to be the one to control this bonus process. 
i screwed around with the numbers for awhile and learned nothing except this one work the best for me.


last but not least important:
[code]hitDiff = 0 + misc.random(25);[/code]

this code is NOT NEEDED. but the random will make a random hit (+the amount of range bonus you have set) + the 0 (the 0 is the lowest number you can hit.legend made this) 
so lets say i list 
[code]hitDiff = 25 + misc.random(50)[/code]

this says i can hit 25-50 no lower or higher unless range bonus and level comes into effect. 
but having this code makes it so 1-99 or whatever ending level range can hit the highest number listed.
i personally think this code ruins range so i would delete it.
it also is under npc and player. so if you want them to be different change both.( unless you only want to fix player on player. legend made this)</description>
