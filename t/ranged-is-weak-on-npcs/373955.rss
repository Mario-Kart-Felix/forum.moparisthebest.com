    <title>Ranged is weak on NPCs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ranged-is-weak-on-npcs/373955</link>
    <description>Hey guys, on my Delta based server ranged is really weak. I&#39;ve changed it to be much stronger than it was before, but this only affects other players. How do I make it so that ranged is also stronger on NPCs?
