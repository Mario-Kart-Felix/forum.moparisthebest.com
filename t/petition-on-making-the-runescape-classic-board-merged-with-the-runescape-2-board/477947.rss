    <title>Petition on making the RuneScape Classic board merged with the RuneScape 2 board</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/petition-on-making-the-runescape-classic-board-merged-with-the-runescape-2-board/477947</link>
    <description>I would like to to make a petition of merging the RuneScape Classic board with the RuneScape 2 board to make it a general RSPS board. With RuneScape Classic on the utmost bottom of the website, it denotes that Classic is not &#39;well-deserved&#39; to be in a higher level. In order to allow both sides to be promoted, an action must be taken place at a high priority. Think of it like this, if we switched both of the boards, I&#39;m pretty sure RuneScape Classic would get more views. This is also unfair to the other side. Solution? Merge both boards! Both boards are promoted this way. Best of both worlds. Happy ending.

If you support this, say something that denotes supportiveness such as, &quot;Support!&quot;

People who support this so far:

              <p>We saw no additional views or popularity change when we moved the RS2 boards above all of general, so we moved them back, why would this be any different?<br>
In my opinion, you’re either into the classic scene or you’re not, I tend to avoid those sections simply because I’m not interested in it, nothing to do with the arrangement of the boards whatsoever.</p>

              <p>No. Classic servers aren’t extremely popular compared to rs2 servers anyways, so of course it’s not going to be one of the top listed server sections, and merging them would only make the section fuller and more cluttered than it needs to be.</p>

              <p>I would like to to make a petition of merging the RuneScape Classic board with the RuneScape 2 board to make it a general RSPS board. With RuneScape Classic on the utmost bottom of the website, it denotes that Classic is not ‘well-deserved’ to be in a higher level. In order to allow both sides to be promoted, an action must be taken place at a high priority. Think of it like this, if we switched both of the boards, I’m pretty sure RuneScape Classic would get more views. This is also unfair to the other side. Solution? Merge both boards! Both boards are promoted this way. Best of both worlds. Happy ending.</p>
<p>If you support this, say something that denotes supportiveness such as, “Support!”</p>
<p>People who support this so far:<br>
