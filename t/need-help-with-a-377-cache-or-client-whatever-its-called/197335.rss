    <title>Need Help With A 377 cache or client... whatever its called</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-a-377-cache-or-client-whatever-its-called/197335</link>
    <description>Yeah, Okay, my client is a 377 cache or something.. I cant remember whats its called, sorry, lol

anyways, my server has all the 317  items, is there a way I can make the client 317 instead of 377? because changing every single item id on my server could take a while.. :S
anyways, if there is a way, please, tell me :) thanks ;)</description>
