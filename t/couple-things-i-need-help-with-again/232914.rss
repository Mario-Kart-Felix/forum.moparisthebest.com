              <p>[quote=“mylust4blood, post:2, topic:232914”]1. there is no real gs walk stance or att: in my oppinion use karils hold walk and run and use 2h crush</p>
<p>2: in tuts look up adding range if not ill look for a code: are you looking to add a bow or rune c’bow?</p>
<ol>
<li>To fix nulls you need to get models to fill them in</li>

<p>2: that means that the command is messed up use a tut and fix it</p>

<li>model maker go to client hacking section and look for it if not the silabsoft forums have one but make sure to come back here :P[/quote]</li>
</ol>
<p>Wow thanks alot i wasnt expecting all the things i need help with in one post =P</p>
<p>Ok no.1 Thanks alot havent been able to figure out GS</p>
<p>no.2 im not trying to add a bow… Im trying to make it so it shoots correctly… With what i got now it will go up to the enemy like it’s going to hit with sword but then it shoots. Im trying to get it so that my player stands away from enemy then shoots. (arrows also dont show on ground)</p>
<p>No.1 Ty for the null fixing but do you have a client that would be good for fixing this? Because theres so many items that have nulls</p>
<p>No.2 Hmm the yell command looks fine but its also different than others that i have seen. ( i have looked for a tut but can’t find one) Do you have a working yell?</p>
<p>No.3 hehe i didn’t think anyone would know how =P</p>
<p>No.4 Thanks! wouldn’t of guessed in the hack section</p>
<p>Tyvm if i could rep i would (when i get 15 rep i will try and find you again to rep)<br>
THANKS!</p>
