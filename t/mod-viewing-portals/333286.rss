    <title>Mod viewing portals</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mod-viewing-portals/333286</link>
    <description>I had a really good idea of adding mod viewing portals. The main purpose would be to let Mods of the game to view areas of the game without having to leave the mod room. It&#39;s basically like a security camera. It would take up the whole screen when you view them. You can have them in areas where lots of botting occurs *cough* lost city *cough* I think it would be pretty hard. Has any of you tried doing it? I keep searching the files and cant seem to find where the camera functions would be located. In camera.java but i can&#39;t figure out how to put it in a object.</description>

              <p>I think thats quite a useless idea, why over complicate things when invis + teleporting does the job just fine, the only thing I can think to be beneficial would be maybe a cam used through say a website admin panel, where people could do a quick check without even having to be ingame. But the way you are talking about doing it is a waste of time + effort.</p>

              <p>No one here has the skill to do anything like this. You’re wasting your time here. It would be a great addition to an administrative team, but like I said, this would take some skill wayyyyy beyond what moparscape has to offer.</p>
