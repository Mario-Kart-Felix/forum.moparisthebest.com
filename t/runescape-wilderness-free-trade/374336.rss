    <description>Listen FIRST. 

I understand a previous topic was made earlier, but I also had a entertaining question that I would like as along with it.

First off, please go vote. These are the days now when we don&#39;t have to play 317&#39;s because we miss the free trade, and the wilderness and the true beauty of runescape that comes along with it.

Go vote www.runescape.com/wilderness All you need to do is enter a valid username. Hell, make 5 accounts and vote on all of them.

My question to you, fellow Moparscapians, is even if it isn&#39;t a full conversion, which I don&#39;t think would ever be possible. What if they decide to put a number of limited worlds where it would be just the same as the old runescape. Do you think this would be a possibility, what would they have to change in order for this to happen. And how many worlds do you think would be sufficient.
