    <description>Hey,

So I am running a RSPS and some of my players can run the webclient from MY website, but some cannot!
Those which can&#39;t get the &quot;Java Plug-in 1.6.0_31Using JRE version 1.6.0_31-b05 Java HotSpot (TM)...&quot; error.. -_-

-Does that means the client is jarred with the &quot;1.6.0_31&quot; version?
-Or they are using a lower version of Java?

I guess they&#39;re using a lower version of Java because my JDK version is &quot;1.7.0_03&quot;..

[hr]

Also, I&#39;ve made a webclient on &quot;RSWebclients&quot; and these which can&#39;t run it from my website..
Well, they can run it from RSW!! The problem is that it&#39;s not my cache, so they can&#39;t see added models..

*Even if they download the client, it doesn&#39;t work.

Anyone can help??</description>

<p>Your friends are most likely using a lower version of java.  My friend has the same problem on his webclient and we tested it by downgrading and upgrading our java versions until we found the minimum version you need in order to run it.</p>

<p>Ok, but if i download a lower version of JDK like “1.6_XX” on my VPS and than re-compile &amp; re-jar it.<br>
Will people with higher version than 1.6_XX be able to run it?</p>
