    <title>A clarification on pornography and pornographic references</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-clarification-on-pornography-and-pornographic-references/465615</link>
    <description>I have updated rule 7 in the global rules list (stickied in this board). Please take a look at it so you are up-to-date with the current rules.

Due to a recent incident, there have been disagreements between the staff and the users about what is allowed for NSFW and what isn&#39;t allowed. I have clarified this point. As a general rule of thumb, pornography is not allowed at all. However, this does not mean that discussion of pornography is disallowed. I mention &#39;deep-root discussion of watching, sharing, creating, etc. pornography&#39; is disallowed. General discussion of it is not, for the same reasons we allow discussion of drugs, alcohol, and other mature topics.

All topics are grandfathered into this rule. If you feel a topic should be unlocked, please message me or another staff member and we&#39;ll get back to you on it (preferably another staff member right now).

And let me finish by saying to use your discretion. This rule is not giving you a leash or inviting you to start discussing porn. I expect a level of maturity and discretion in each and every member of this community. Understand how what you post affects other members of this community and how they view you. Please don&#39;t abuse this rule modification. If anything, it is more restrictive than before, not less.

Thanks,
Administration</description>

              <p>I’m going to add that unless you have a legitimate reason to argue with this clarification, stop playing devil’s advocate. We make the rules and we interpret them. Mopar doesn’t want porn here and neither do I. What more do you need to know? This needs no discussion because, in it’s root, it’s extremely simple. Something was posted that we do not want and this clarification has been made to justify that being locked.</p>
<p>I will also add that I specifically made this a broad rule to encapsulate other less-explicit discussions that do not directly involve pornography. These discussions have happened fine in the past and this clarification intends for them to be able to continue to happen. That has nothing to do with porn nor will it ever.</p>

              <p>That’s if you want to <span class="bbcode-i">allow</span>/put up NSFW content, not if you want to <span class="bbcode-i">disallow</span> it (that would be retarded). The OP says that this change actually makes the rule MORE strict, not LESS strict.</p>
<p>Anyways I’m going to lock this. Any wannabe lawyers that want to argue Moparisthebest is legally bound to allow you to post NSFW content for whatever reason can direct their concerns to <a href="http://www.massmailsoftware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/trash-can.jpg" data-bbcode="true">his official complaints repository</a>. And in regards to the rule in general, if you question whether or not your topic/thread would be allowed, feel free to PM any staff member and we’ll give you our best advice. Otherwise it’s best to just keep that type of stuff away from Moparscape.</p>

That would “legally” mean that this forum’s activity would drop 85%, since a majority of us (except for you, and some others), wouldn’t be allowed on here, since the age for viewing such things is 18 (IIRC).

Ah, you are right there. I know what you mean now. Why did this aspect of this get brought up though? I mean, if we <span class="bbcode-i">were</span> allowed to post pornographic material, we would have to include “NSFW” tags, which should also constitute that it’s not for childrens’ eyes.</p>

              <p>Actually David, I am glad you brought up the point about parents.</p>
<p>Anybody who are under a certain age is required to give parental consent on anything online to use. So, if the tos has a general one ( considering I doubt MITB has enough legal knowledge to write his own binding one ) and it most likely says in there that the forum is not responsible for what is posted blah blah. Meaning, general pornography can be discussed but not explicitly posted without prior warning/age warnings.</p>
<p>It’s sort of like Google really. Ever tried to go to a blog on Google and it will stop you first saying “hey, are you 18? the shit you about to browse is for those who are 18 plus” etc etc.</p>

<p>last I checked, this forum does ask for your birthday doesn’t it?</p>
<p>EDIT: as a matter considering you kiddies want to talk about legality purposes I believe you should read this and change part of your privacy policy.</p>

<p>EDIT <span class="hashtag">#2:</span> It seems you do not have a privacy policy able to view as a registered member which also goes against the law.</p>

Why do you feel the need to discuss brazzers girls in the first place?  I didn’t see the topic but I can’t imagine the real ‘discussion’ in it being too thrilling, almost seems as if some of you are running out of ideas for topics.  Just grow up.<br>

<p>A lot of the “used to be younger audience” are now older. You have to keep in mind that this forum was made back in 2005/06. That’s six years. SO theoretically a 12 year could be 18 now.[/quote]‘Theoretically’ there could also be 6 year olds browsing the forums. What’s your point?</p>
<p>[quote=“Fails, post:35, topic:465615”]New members join everyday, most of them averaging between the ages of 12-15, which in my eyes are old enough to learn about things such as this.[/quote]Doesn’t mean we should be the ones teaching them, lol. Completely up to their parents.</p>

New members join everyday, most of them averaging between the ages of 12-15, which in my eyes are old enough to learn about things such as this.<br>
[/quote]<br>
But not old enough to view any of it.[/quote]Again up to their parents. Of course this is completely besides the fact it’s illegal to view porn in the USA under the age of 18 and by listing your favorite pornstar you are basically admitting to breaking the law  :rolleyes:</p>
