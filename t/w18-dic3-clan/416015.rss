Hello and welcome to the official page of &quot;W18 Dic3&quot;.

W18 dic3 is a new friends chat which was released today  based on &quot;Legit&quot; Dicing. Nowadays there are many clans which claim to be legit dicers for the sake of earning money for them selves. With &quot;W18 dic3&quot; we are an open host clan chat which accepts all hosters under one condition.

The one condition/ requirement to being a hoster in &quot;W18 Dic3&quot; is to be legit. By the term &quot;Legit&quot; I mean you must pay out to players when you have lost and they have won.

If you are scammed by a &quot;Rank&quot; and have evidence which can be posted in our &quot;Photo Gallery&quot; We will gladly refund your money to make sure that you are satisfied with our services. Remember to trust ranks over other players as you are more assured of payment as &quot;Ranks&quot; have payed a high sum of money for there position and if found not to be legit they will be &quot;Banned&quot; from the clan meaning their money has gone to waste.

In &quot;W18 dic3&quot; we also complete a number of drop parties a week ranging from 20m up to 500m depending on the amount of players who are in clan chat, so if you invite your friends there is a higher chance of a big drop party. 

 So remember Trust Ranks and i hope you have fun dicing in our New friends chat! Remember be nice as this is also a social friends chat!

In &quot;W18 dic3&quot; there are two main numbers of dicing, these numbers vary from rank to non-rank.

Non- ranks

Non ranks are only allowed to do a maximum of 55x2 dicing the reason for this is to keep dicing fair amongst  normal players. Non-ranks are also allowed to do &quot;DD&quot; with any type of dice they please ( No mins or Max&#39;s)

Ranks

Ranks are allowed to do a maximum of 65x2 dicing. The only Ranks who are allowed to host 65x2 dice games are  &quot;Generals&quot;. The reason why Generals are allowed to do 65x2 is because General is a rank which can not be bought but earned therefore meaning they are 100 percent Legit and can be trusted.

 All other ranks are allowed to host a maximum of 60x2 as they have paid for their ranks therefore allowing them to have more benefits within the clan.

 

Costs of Rank 

Recruit: 5m

Corporal: 10m

Sergeant: 15m

Lieutenant: 20m

Captain: 40m

General: Is earned by legit dicing. ( Player must have rank to earn general)

<p>I got the criteria but what about people who are new players and don’t have any good ranking? So without ranking can take the benefit of this chat application?</p>
