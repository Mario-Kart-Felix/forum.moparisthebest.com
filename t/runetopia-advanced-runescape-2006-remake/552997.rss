have tryed out so many servers I can’t count them all, most of them have same group begging for same things, get them, max out fast and leave, server dies…<br>
then there’s a solid group of true oldschool players who like the grind, like a challange, not that one or the other is better, but there are 1,000 of yalls, and very few remakes worth a crap…so<br>
community is thriving, forums are active, and steady mid population, so<br>
give it a try, ya might remember why you started playing the game…and find some sharp players who will kick with ya, all are welcome…peace <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/cool.png?v=5" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"></p>

We don’t enforce specific servers rules on the forums, and there is nothing in the rules here that says people can’t abuse bugs on servers they find. Feel free to ban people on your own site/game that break your rules, but I suggest you just fix the problems rather than complaining here.<br>

</aside>
<p>RuneTopia banned an individual with a history of repeat bug abuse when they registered an account on his server under the name “bug abuse” who later admitted to intending bug abuse after they agreed to not perpetrate any bug abuse. Where is the discrepancy here? It was never stated that the individual in question ever had to actually carry out their plans to infringe upon the rules, and as it is his server, it is fully within RuneTopia’s jurisdiction to decide what justifies penalty.</p>

<p>I was referring to Miss Silabsoft’s offer to “find any potential dupe, dupe a bunch of items quietly and allow them to keep the account with the duped items” and her statement of “For your server I will make an exception and be one of those other bug abusers that do it to destroy economies/gain massive unfair advantages.”</p>

<p>Fair enough, however let’s look at this from different point of view. You could say Silabsoft is doing them a favor even if it’s out of spite; if they’re smart they could of easily spun the situation in their favor by correcting vulnerabilities that would cost them much more down the road, as it is still in a “beta” phase. It’s all strategic on how these types of situations are handled, they (the server owners) could have been the “bigger man” here and show that these types of attacks can be handled gracefully. What did they do instead? They decided it would be better to further aggravate the supposed “threat” to falsely show they are in control.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There should be no reason for a person to have to deal with an individual who holds the title of “ex-staff” as if they are acting out of spite. We should expect better from an average member of the community, and much more from those who should be role models. If Miss Silabsoft had in reality merely wanted to help the server, she would have contacted RuneTopia individually and proposed her idea, and if he accepted, proceeded to discretely find any issues and collaborate with RuneTopia to rectify them. She could have even published what had been done afterward without issue, provided that any problems reported on had been fixed. Instead, she accepted a contract requiring her to not perpetrate bug abuse with, as she has admitted, full intentions to violate the terms of her agreement. You cannot deny that Miss Silabsoft has acted completely unprofessionally here, and while some good might have come of it, that good was not in her primary intentions.</p>

Couple of things from an observer here…</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Not sure it was “professional” to ban someone based on their name alone, making the assumption that bug abuse was going to occur without any actual evidence or suggestion should make any player wonder why they’d bother joining…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resorting to ad hominem attacks because of your incompetence as a server owner is a big red flag to anyone wanting to play (server owner cannot handle criticisms and clearly does not address issues appropriately) for anyone wanting to play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I as well as others will likely be rooting for Silabsoft in this case, she did nothing wrong to deserve that ban. I’d have to say its quite naive to assume your players are going to follow rules without trying to break things, especially in this community. Naturally, once the bugs are abused and shown without any fixes it will only prove that you were never really fit to run a private server.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Oh well…<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>To be fair, both Miss Silabsoft as well as RuneTopia are acting rather childish. I would say Miss Silabsoft more so seeing as she is the one who instigated the entire thing by reacting to what I see as a legitimate ban, seeing as she just admitted to intending bug abuse, with threats of ruining the server and the enjoyment of potentially hundreds of people. Additionally, Miss Silabsoft’s attempt to put herself forward as being innocent immediately after making these threats only further makes her seem both shallow and immature.</p>

<p>Hmm, not sure I agree it was a legitimate ban… there is nothing otherwise suggesting that she did anything other than signing up. Let’s look at whats been presented:</p>
<p>Regarding Silabsoft’s malicious intentions</p>
<blockquote>considering the server isn't even open it was just the name of my character. Maybe I wanted to play legitimately with that name</blockquote>
<p>This gives us no indication on her original intent and whether or not it was malicious in nature, so anything suggesting it was more than that is merely speculation at best.</p>
<p>On the other hand RuneTopia seems to only post that Silabsoft had somehow already violated the rules without any actual evidence at to what bugs were exploited if any…:</p>
<blockquote>You are just showing the community how unprofesional you are, you accepted to the rules before joining, bug abusing isn't allowed. If you don't like the rules, please leave as stated</blockquote>
<p>Unless otherwise proven, I cannot see how the ban was justified. I want to also point out, it is the server operator’s responsibility to cover and prevent any types of attacks regardless of their intention, it is after all a cheating community so I don’t feel sorry for them as other servers have had to endure the same.</p>
<blockquote>I can't say that either party is fully within the right, but RuneTopia definitely stands on better ground here, as he simply made childish remarks, whereas Miss Silabsoft has made childish remarks, threats of malicious action, and has falsely claimed that this malicious action is actually in the spirit of benevolence.</blockquote>
<p>Fair enough, however let’s look at this from different point of view. You could say Silabsoft is doing them a favor even if it’s out of spite; if they’re smart they could of easily spun the situation in their favor by correcting vulnerabilities that would cost them much more down the road, as it is still in a “beta” phase.

<p>Anyway, I just want you to understand I’m on neither party’s side, I don’t agree with how either party approached this situation frankly, but in all reality Silabsoft will do what she wants, whether its right or not is not really our justification to make.</p>

The developers SHOULD try and fix these exploits with effort, but if they cannot and receive no help in doing so then they should not be PUNISHED.

<p>Resorting to ad hominem attacks because of your incompetence as a server owner is a big red flag to anyone wanting to play (server owner cannot handle criticisms and clearly does not address issues appropriately) for anyone wanting to play.</p>

<li>
<p>I as well as others will likely be rooting for Silabsoft in this case, she did nothing wrong to deserve that ban. I’d have to say its quite naive to assume your players are going to follow rules without trying to break things, especially in this community. Naturally, once the bugs are abused and shown without any fixes it will only prove that you were never really fit to run a private server.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Oh well…[/quote]</p>
<p>To be fair, both Miss Silabsoft as well as RuneTopia are acting rather childish. I would say Miss Silabsoft more so seeing as she is the one who instigated the entire thing by reacting to what I see as a legitimate ban, seeing as she just admitted to intending bug abuse, with threats of ruining the server and the enjoyment of potentially hundreds of people. Additionally, Miss Silabsoft’s attempt to put herself forward as being innocent immediately after making these threats only further makes her seem both shallow and immature.</p>
<p>I can’t say that either party is fully within the right, but RuneTopia definitely stands on better ground here, as he simply made childish remarks, whereas Miss Silabsoft has made childish remarks, threats of malicious action, and has falsely claimed that this malicious action is actually in the spirit of benevolence.</p>
