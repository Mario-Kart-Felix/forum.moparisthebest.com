    <description>I am kingdhum on rune-server, and i have not been into server for about 5-6 months and have decided to come back with one of my old servers.  I tried to start it up yesterday, i did everything, i port frowarded, i installed no-ip, i installed jdk, started the server, pinged it, everything, and i put it on server status list&#39;s and it says it is offline.  I have some pics showing how i have it setup.
