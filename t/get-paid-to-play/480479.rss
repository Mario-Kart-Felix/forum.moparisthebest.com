    <title>Get paid to play</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/get-paid-to-play/480479</link>
    <description>RSC isn&#39;t suppose to be a 12 year game, even Jagex admitted to it not even being a two year game. This relates to private servers because we all get the drift. A server starts up, people play, server shuts down, people look for another one. Its a cycle that has been going on for ages and the number of players we see in the community are determined by how good the server is. 

I have been developing a server privately for quite sometime now and I don&#39;t want the server to end up like the rest of them. I thought I could prolong or control the fate of the server by making level caps. When you pay the max stat is 60. Each week or every so often the cap would increase by 10 until we get to level 99. After that the game becomes boring again. 

There is only so much you can do with RSC, the way it was designed is limited. If you create a replica, it&#39;s too tough for a private server because we know that private server will be shutdown (unless it&#39;s ran by moparscape then we have a little faith). If you create a custom server, you only get so much interest until inflation takes over and the developer is too busy with irl to develop something new. 

I believe I found a way for my server to &#39;last&#39; longer than it should.. and the only way I could do this is by paying the players.. sounds ironic but hear me out.

The game will operate by &#39;seasons&#39;. A season will last x amount of days. During the x amount of days you simply play, gain levels, kill monsters, build your homeland (a concept of my server) kill players, etc etc. Basically you gain points by how much you contributed to the game. At the end of the season all of the players stats/items will be wiped and points will be handed out accordingly.

A high scores system will show who has the highest points and the top x amount of players could potentially get paid.
On top of getting paid, players will get some bonus for the next season. I see a lot of servers startup for the money or be head dk of the community.. and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what we are here to do, what about a server that gives back?

This system is beneficial because if a player knows they won&#39;t be playing for the next season they don&#39;t have to waste their time. A new season brings new hype for anyone to dominate the top points list. Every player can potentially be on the high scores (for different seasons) and have something to brag about.

What do you think?</description>

<p>I much prefer f2p style servers with max 99s and no customs. I’d like to see a server like this put up with a real economy where hats and rares, and rune/drag items are made to be appreciated and not overlooked.[/quote]The problem is, that from the beginning everyone knows you’ll become insanely rich if you get 99 smithing, so everyone gets it as fast as possible. You also have teams of people and botters, which get them there faster than on RSC. Once there are too many suppliers for the demand, the prices drop.</p>
<p>There isn’t really that much you can do to stall the process, that wouldn’t piss people off.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Rodgerwilco, post:1, topic:480479”]RSC isn’t suppose to be a 12 year game, even Jagex admitted to it not even being a two year game. This relates to private servers because we all get the drift. A server starts up, people play, server shuts down, people look for another one. Its a cycle that has been going on for ages and the number of players we see in the community are determined by how good the server is.</p>
<p>I have been developing a server privately for quite sometime now and I don’t want the server to end up like the rest of them. I thought I could prolong or control the fate of the server by making level caps. When you pay the max stat is 60. Each week or every so often the cap would increase by 10 until we get to level 99. After that the game becomes boring again.</p>
<p>There is only so much you can do with RSC, the way it was designed is limited. If you create a replica, it’s too tough for a private server because we know that private server will be shutdown (unless it’s ran by moparscape then we have a little faith). If you create a custom server, you only get so much interest until inflation takes over and the developer is too busy with irl to develop something new.</p>
<p>I believe I found a way for my server to ‘last’ longer than it should… and the only way I could do this is by paying the players… sounds ironic but hear me out.</p>
<p>The game will operate by ‘seasons’. A season will last x amount of days. During the x amount of days you simply play, gain levels, kill monsters, build your homeland (a concept of my server) kill players, etc etc. Basically you gain points by how much you contributed to the game. At the end of the season all of the players stats/items will be wiped and points will be handed out accordingly.</p>
<p>A high scores system will show who has the highest points and the top x amount of players could potentially get paid.<br>
On top of getting paid, players will get some bonus for the next season. I see a lot of servers startup for the money or be head dk of the community… and I don’t think that’s what we are here to do, what about a server that gives back?</p>
<p>This system is beneficial because if a player knows they won’t be playing for the next season they don’t have to waste their time. A new season brings new hype for anyone to dominate the top points list. Every player can potentially be on the high scores (for different seasons) and have something to brag about.</p>
<p>What do you think?[/quote]</p>
<p>Interesting, I like it, but it kind of opposed players who want to play because they want to bring back old memories</p>
