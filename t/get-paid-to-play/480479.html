        <p>RSC isn’t suppose to be a 12 year game, even Jagex admitted to it not even being a two year game. This relates to private servers because we all get the drift. A server starts up, people play, server shuts down, people look for another one. Its a cycle that has been going on for ages and the number of players we see in the community are determined by how good the server is.</p>
<p>I have been developing a server privately for quite sometime now and I don’t want the server to end up like the rest of them. I thought I could prolong or control the fate of the server by making level caps. When you pay the max stat is 60. Each week or every so often the cap would increase by 10 until we get to level 99. After that the game becomes boring again.</p>
<p>There is only so much you can do with RSC, the way it was designed is limited. If you create a replica, it’s too tough for a private server because we know that private server will be shutdown (unless it’s ran by moparscape then we have a little faith). If you create a custom server, you only get so much interest until inflation takes over and the developer is too busy with irl to develop something new.</p>
<p>I believe I found a way for my server to ‘last’ longer than it should… and the only way I could do this is by paying the players… sounds ironic but hear me out.</p>
<p>The game will operate by ‘seasons’. A season will last x amount of days. During the x amount of days you simply play, gain levels, kill monsters, build your homeland (a concept of my server) kill players, etc etc. Basically you gain points by how much you contributed to the game. At the end of the season all of the players stats/items will be wiped and points will be handed out accordingly.</p>
<p>A high scores system will show who has the highest points and the top x amount of players could potentially get paid.<br>
On top of getting paid, players will get some bonus for the next season. I see a lot of servers startup for the money or be head dk of the community… and I don’t think that’s what we are here to do, what about a server that gives back?</p>
<p>This system is beneficial because if a player knows they won’t be playing for the next season they don’t have to waste their time. A new season brings new hype for anyone to dominate the top points list. Every player can potentially be on the high scores (for different seasons) and have something to brag about.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>Interesting, I like it, but it kind of opposed players who want to play because they want to bring back old memories</p>

        <p>You can’t replicate memories… I think everyone should understand that. I often see when a server comes out people use the same price guides from 2002-03 era when R2h was 60k. Why are we stuck on these prices? I do not know.</p>

You also have teams of people and botters, which get them there faster than on RSC. Once there are too many suppliers for the demand, the prices drop.</p>
<p>There isn’t really that much you can do to stall the process, that wouldn’t piss people off.</p>

Remove mining and smithing of rune… have it so you can only mine and smith addy as the highest. Implement other ways of getting rune, i.e, Only from drops? Just stabbing in the dark here but theres always a solution to things.</p>
<p>Or bring out the banhammer!!! haha<br>
[/quote]Doing either of those would piss people off…[/quote]</p>
<p>Doing either of those things would not only piss people off but would extremely limit the market. The point of a private server is for people to obtain things they didnt have in the real game (full rune set, rares, large amounts of cash etc etc)</p>
<p>What irritates me and I will never figure it out is why people think they should be able to ::buy runes in large quantities… any magician knows that magic is a rich mans game. Yes it’s cute when you’re level 8 hitting 4’s but death and blood runes took some serious cash to buy. Even the big bois bought super sets for 100k a pop when it came to combat. It took so much work and that would turned into value.</p>
<p>I created a system awhile back and I don’t people would be into it… but it’s an irl money duel system. Since private servers lack effort/time why not we put our money where our mouth is and lay down some cash on a rsc duel? I wouldn’t trust any server doing this which is why I abandoned it.</p>
<p>As CFF stated, everyone knows the drift… work in teams to tackle a new server. You can get somebody to level 99 smithing within a week and in return you have 10 guys dominating the monsters drops and the wild.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/larsftw.html">@larsftw</a> yes, you’re on the right track with taking money out of the economy but why remove rune? Why not make it harder to collect fish and let the fishing market dominate the game?</p>
