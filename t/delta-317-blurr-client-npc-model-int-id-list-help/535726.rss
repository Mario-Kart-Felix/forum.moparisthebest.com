    <title>[DELTA-317/Blurr Client] NPC Model Int/ID List Help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-317-blurr-client-npc-model-int-id-list-help/535726</link>
    <description>I have been looking on the internet for a composed list of the NPC Models, yet to no avail. I was wondering if someone could link me to it or have one to post.

To explain what I am saying, I will compare it to the Item Int List. Basically, it tells you the IDs and Int&#39;s of the original items on runescape. Example: &quot;i == 1004 / model = 2775 / name string = null&quot; etc. I wish to have this for NPCs as well. The original &quot;built in&quot; NPCs from runescape, such as the Grim Reaper/Death, I want his model id at the current moment. So that would be something like:
[code]if(i == 2862) { 					
	aClass30_Sub2_Sub2_60.anInt1406 = anIntArray72[630];
	class5.method165(true, aClass30_Sub2_Sub2_60);
	class5.aStringArray66 = new String[5];
	class5.aStringArray66[1] = &quot;Attack&quot;;
	class5.aString65 = &quot;Death&quot;;
	class5.anInt61 = 9001;
	class5.aByteArray89 = &quot;The Grim Reaper himself!&quot;.getBytes();
	//class5.anIntArray94 = new int[1];
	//class5.anIntArray94[0] = 4095;
     }[/code]

With 4095 being his model number, his main model. However, this is not his model, this is just an example, that is the model id for the Spirit/CorpBeast. I wish for an original, non-custom file with each int explained, just as the item int list.txt is explained. Does this already exist? I feel like I have seen it before, however I cannot find it and I have been searching as thoroughly as I can.

Help?

<p>To explain what I am saying, I will compare it to the Item Int List. Basically, it tells you the IDs and Int’s of the original items on runescape. Example: “i == 1004 / model = 2775 / name string = null” etc. I wish to have this for NPCs as well. The original “built in” NPCs from runescape, such as the Grim Reaper/Death, I want his model id at the current moment. So that would be something like:</p>
<p><code>if(i == 2862) { 					
	aClass30_Sub2_Sub2_60.anInt1406 = anIntArray72[630];

	class5.aStringArray66[1] = "Attack";
	class5.aString65 = "Death";
	class5.anInt61 = 9001;
	class5.aByteArray89 = "The Grim Reaper himself!".getBytes();
	//class5.anIntArray94 = new int[1];
	//class5.anIntArray94[0] = 4095;
