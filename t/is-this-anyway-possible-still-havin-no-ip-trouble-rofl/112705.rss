    <title>Is this anyway possible? (Still havin No-Ip Trouble Rofl)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-this-anyway-possible-still-havin-no-ip-trouble-rofl/112705</link>
    <description>If you didn&#39;t have a server.java anywhere in your entire folder of source, Would it stop the no-ip connect somehow but still allow you, yourself to get on?

Also, What are some of the ways No-Ip isn&#39;t connecting besides Port Forwarding and how many think the problem is the port forwarding?</description>
