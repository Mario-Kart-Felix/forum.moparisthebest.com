    <title>Help playing on ANY server in Moparscape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-playing-on-any-server-in-moparscape/94258</link>
    <description>Hello everyone... I just heard of Moparscape last Saturday and have been captivated by what can be done here. I quit playing runescape in 2003, but now that I hear the game can be edited and personally changed I want to play on some Moparscape servers. The problem:

1. ANY server I try to log on to says &#39;Unable to connect, server must be down, please try another server&#39;.

2. I&#39;ve checked my java on several occasions to see if I have the most updated version and it turns out I do.. 

3. The path to my Java IS set and I have confirmed this by going to the Jagex&#39;s www.runescape.com site and playing on their servers which works perfectly fine. I just can&#39;t play on any of the Mopar servers...
I really want to play on the servers posted in this RS2 section so can anyone here please help me out?</description>
