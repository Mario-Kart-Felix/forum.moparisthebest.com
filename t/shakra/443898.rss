    <title>Shakra</title>

    <description>Recently I came across a band called Shakra, and in my opinion, they&#39;re the greatest band out there today and definitely in my top whatever of all time. They&#39;re not very popular, but not really underground either. They play metal music and keep their tuning in Drop C (from what I can tell anyway), but are criticized for their &quot;80s guitar riffs&quot; and poor lyrics (very... poor lyrics &gt;_&gt;) which are what I think make them great. They focus on their instrumental sound, awesome rhythm progressions, sweet buildups, and really nice harmonies in their guitar solos. They&#39;re not the best live band in terms of entertainment, but their sound is still awesome and just like the album versions. Here are some of my favorite songs by them:

-Dollar Too Much
-Fight The Fire
-Back On Track
-The Sun Will Shine
-Brand New Day
-Regressive Evolution
-Why Don&#39;t You Call Me
-Crazy

That&#39;s just a few of many. If you&#39;re going to listen to anything off their Back On Track album, just keep in mind there are two versions. One, the official one, has every song played with a much slower tempo. The faster ones are much better and can be found on YouTube. For the rest, I recommend using [url=http://grooveshark.com/#!/artist/Shakra/128583]Grooveshark[/url]. To get a quick taste of their sound, listen to [url=http://grooveshark.com/s/Done+Me+Wrong/3i0DQg?src=5]This Song[/url] at about 1:00 when the miniature guitar solo starts. It kicks all form of ass.

Anyway, just thought I&#39;d share them since they definitely deserve to be more well-known.
