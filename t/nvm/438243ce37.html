<p>Sure does help, though. There’s, what? 7 billion or so humans living now. It could arguably be the best adaptation for any situation, for you are able to problem solve. Most definitely the most adaptable for solving a multitude of problems.

<p>I had several(well, 2) paragraphs written out about Neanderthals which related to why not every species is “smart”, the simple fact is we don’t know why Neanderthals went extinct, we do know however that Neanderthals at the time required 100-350 more calories than equivalent modern humans, coupled with a lack of resources and competing with humans, it’s likely humans killed or bred out the Neanderthals[/quote]<br>
Interesting. Did I overlook your paragraphs or was it posted earlier? I also read an article that they found some shell necklaces that were believed to be create by Neanderthals, which makes scientists believe that they had some sort of culture. We also came from the same ancestor Neanderthals did (heildelbergensis), so perhaps that is when intelligence first started developing and we just built upon it more than the Neanderthals. iirc Neanderthals relied heavily on their brute strength to hunt. Believe it was their right arm that was larger? Don’t quote me on that, though. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>I had a post written out which went into depth about it but I hit refresh instead of preview and lost it all</p>
<p>I’ll be back in 10 mins and start rewriting it out again, but mostly because I want to show the miller-urey experiment wasn’t “proven wrong” heh</p>
<p>fun fact in the mean time: if proto-humans hadn’t changed their diet to include meat, we wouldn’t be here and our brains would be on par with other great apes at the time, again I’ll explain this in a few hours</p>

        <p>The only certainty life contains is death. You could take two views to this question, as it is rather broad. The one could be from the Darwinistic viewpoint in which we are to capitalize on the resources given to us and survive as a species, outlasting those who stand in our way and eventually evolving into a master species. The other would be the humanistic viewpoint in which we go beyond surviving and thrive on the things offered to us, using the emotions given to us to enjoy what is provided in this world to love, hate, or simply be along for the ride. While it may all end the same for people, I believe it is the path we take along the journey. Suffering is an important aspect, but that, in the long run, is always rewarded with a sense of self satisfaction, which is true feeling of success. When we feel successful, we do better things. When we do better things, we achieve more as a species. When we achieve more as a species, we dominate all and continue to thrive for thousands of years.</p>

        <p>[ul][quote=“The Wanderer, post:206, topic:438243”]Agreed, yet they aren’t having nuclear warfare either. And yes, natural selection means the strongest and better equipped creatures will survive. Why has no other species adapted a more intelligent brain (yes you said some animals are intelligent, like dolphins and chimpanzees. I guess they could just be behind and be catching up) yet? There’s millions of species of animals on the earth. I just feel that we shouldn’t and wouldn’t be the only ones to develop a more comprehensive intelligence. Also some scientists believe that chimpanzees aren’t really understanding language, but just performing tasks for rewards. Basically the same thing when we tell a dog to sit or roll over and then give them a treat.[/quote]</p>
<p>I just want to point out that natural selection has nothing to do with the “strongest or the fittest”, natural selection simply means that an animal that is best adapt to the environment and environmental changes, the more likely it is to survive. As tL pointed out, if a species over time evolves to be simpler and uses less resources, the environment can support more of that species meaning it is more likely to survive, additionally if a species evolves over time to require more resources, the environment cannot support that population and they are more likely to be affected by a change in environment such as receding forests. Think of it this way, you’re in the desert and only have so much water, if you ration your water out to last 3 weeks, you have a better chance of surviving for 3 weeks than if you drink all your water in 3-5 days. It’s a bad analogy but I hope you understand.</p>
<p>As for chimpanzees not understanding language, I suggest looking up the mirror test, basically, it’s a test to measure if an animal can observe itself in a mirror, showing signs of being self aware, a trait of intelligence</p>

how are we unique? no, I’m serious, please fill me in[/quote]<br>
Not sure if unique is the best word, as each species is unique in its own way, but we definitely are different. As I said earlier, scientists predict we have 18 unique genes inside of our genome. I believe they have found 4 definite ones iirc. Then again, I haven’t looked into how many other organisms have unique genes, so that argument may be flawed. One such famous gene is the FOXP2 gene. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP2" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">wikipedia</a>). iirc other organisms have that gene, although only one has it on the same degree of function as we do or something like that. Been a while since I read it, but I believe it was a bat and it still isn’t on the same degree of importance for speech as it is in us.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’d like to point out that Neanderthals had the same gene, with the same functionality as humans.</p>
<p>This gene doesn’t necessarily go against evolution, it’s expected that genes lose function. We for example have all the genes for a tail but they are inactive.</p>
<p>[quote=“The Wanderer, post:206, topic:438243”][quote author=Niall link=topic=540961.msg3986786#msg3986786 date=1335987660]<br>
earlier I mentioned “the big bang”, did you know that the name for the big bang theory was coined by a scientist who opposed the theory? you see, the big bang isn’t a bang or an explosion, it’s an expansion of space and time, and even today the big bang is still banging, that is, the universe is still expanding[/quote] Sorry to go off on a tangent, but recently scientists have discovered that we are currently expanding even faster rather than the opposed slowing down. I find this really interesting. I also wondered, before when they thought the expansion was slowing down, that if this wasn’t the first “world”. For example it would explode then go back to a point and then explode again and ect. And what if the same thing happened every single time. So like there was a Niall previous to this one that had this discussion before and there will be one again in the future having the same discussion. I guess this wouldn’t be the case with the new discoveries, but perhaps they are wrong again? :P[/quote]</p>
<p>The idea of multiple universes is quite mind boggling, isn’t it?</p>
<p>On the subject of why not every animal is smart, there are dozens of factors and reasons, here are two of them.</p>
<p>One, there is only so much genetic complexity that can be had before you can no longer add new genes to the existing ones, that is, if you want new genetic information you have to make older genetic information inactive. It’s quite a technical field and I don’t understand any of it. Heh. The human genome consists of something on the order of 3 million bases, but only around 2% of that codes into protein, the rest is mostly inactive and called junk dna.</p>
<p>Two, natural selection. As I mentioned earlier, a species that can best adapt to a new environment is most likely to survive. Proto-humans as a real world example at some point adapted their diet to include meat. At the time forests and such were receding, this gave proto-humans a huge advantage over other primates who were mostly on a strict vegetarian diet. Another interesting side effect of eating meat, was it provided all the required nutrients and proteins etc for the evolution of the human brain. This is almost undisputed. Had proto-humans not changed their diet to include meat, it’s almost certain we wouldn’t be here today in the same capacity that we currently are. You will also find for example, that if you change to a strict vegetarian or vegan diet, without proper dieting advice it is very easy to become seriously ill, as to get all the required nutrients, proteins etc from a vegan diet means you need a very varied diet, or you could simply abandon being a vegan or vegetarian and eat some meat every now and then and mostly not have to worry about diet for a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>Another interesting fact that I mentioned in an earlier post is that Neanderthals had a higher calorie requirement than humans, something on the order of 100-350 calories a day. Neanderthals had a bigger body mass than humans, this allowed them to stay warm in colder climates without much of a need for animal furs, but as a side effect the average Neanderthal community compared to a human one would have needed to hunt and eat more. Neanderthals most likely competed with humans and other animals for food, coupled with dwindling forests(Neanderthals preferred hunting ground) meant that it’s most likely that humans bred the Neanderthals out or simply killed them off.</p>
<p>So, one of the reasons why humans are where we are today is because of a change in diet to include meat, and while it’s possible we wouldn’t have needed to eat meat in order to get here it’s likely that it couldn’t have happened otherwise. But there you go. Give a load of primates a diet high in meat, nutrients and let them fuck all day long and in a few hundred thousand years they might become intelligent too.</p>

<p>[quote=“frozon566, post:207, topic:438243”]it’s to bad the miller-Urey expirement was proven wrong,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.truthinscience.org.uk/tis2/index.php/component/content/article/51.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.truthinscience.org.uk/tis2/index.php/component/content/article/51.html</a>[/quote]</p>
<p>The first argument that page makes was that the experiment was conducted under conditions that may not have represented the conditions of a primordial earth. You know, one of the real surprising things about the miller-urey experiment wasn’t the fact the atmosphere used created life, the real surprising thing was such a simple chemical process could create compounds essential to life. But anyway, onwards!</p>
<blockquote>Firstly, consider the gaseous mixture.  This was supposed to replicate the primeval atmosphere on the Earth.  You will notice that there is an absence of oxygen and nitrogen which are the main elemental constituents of our present environment.  The problem recognised by Miller and his colleagues was that oxygen would destroy any organic material in the experiment and certainly in the period of time they allocated to the early period on the planet.  For example, when we die, we decay.  A part of that process (in addition to bacterial action) is the oxidation of the organic materials in the body, generating carbon dioxide and water.
<p>Consequently, evolutionary scientists have proposed that the early Earth had no elemental oxygen. It would, in fact, be a “reducing atmosphere”, the opposite of the modern oxidising one.  (They go on to hypothesise that this would gradually change as primitive life produced oxygen through processes such as photosynthesis).  However, the evidence for this reducing atmosphere is very tenuous. Increasingly we are finding from geological and palaeontological research that an oxygen-based atmosphere must have existed from the earliest times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The premise here is that oxygen would have been present around the time of a primordial earth, and “from the earliest times” which is absolutely bullshit.</p>
<p>Banded iron formations, for instance, are commonly found unoxidised or only partially oxidized 2.5 bya(billion years ago) or later, however from 2.2ish bya to 1.9 bya, the rate of unoxidised banded iron formations decrease as the rate of oxidized banded iron formations increases, suggesting that the amount of oxygen increased during this era, and that before this era the amount of oxygen available wasn’t enough to oxidise the banded iron formations.</p>
<p>Additionally, redox-sensitive(redox being oxidization-reduction, that is, redox-sensitive being material that is sensitive to oxidization) heavy minerals have been found in the Archean period (2.5 bya) that have been weathered and show signs of erosion from several episodes, indicating that there was very little, if any oxygen or oxidizing elements available. source - <a href="http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/content/27/2/115.short" rel="nofollow noopener">http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/content/27/2/115.short</a></p>
<p>So, when that website says that evidence points to an oxygen-based atmosphere existing from “the earliest times”, they are either lying or have not take into account all the research available to them.</p>
<p>Fun fact, the term “evolutionary scientists” is nonsensical, there is no such thing as an “evolutionary scientist”, there are however “evolutionary biologists” but that refers to the field of evolutionary biology which studies the process of evolution, which is an observable fact, not to be confused with the theory of evolution.</p>
<blockquote>But, we can ask whether the atmosphere proposed by Miller was likely to be stable.  Abelson reports that the ammonia in the atmosphere would have decomposed within 30,000 years: it is inherently unstable, decomposing into nitrogen and hydrogen. Also, much of it would dissolve out of the atmosphere due to its great solubility in water. Methane would only have lasted for about 1% of the time required for the appearance of life by this process, according to Shimzu. Brinkman has shown that even the water vapour would have been broken down due to the sun’s radiation.  The trouble is that we think of these gases as stable – indeed they are relative to our lifetime, but not on the evolutionary timescales.</blockquote>
<p>That’s a fucking laugh. This statement is very misleading, you see, it states that ammonia and methane for example simply could not last, and while that is the case, they do not account for natural sources of ammonia and methane. (Jonathan Wells book only lists volcanoes as the only contributing factor to the atmosphere, I assume this website uses this assumption also) Of course one source for methane and ammonia is mid-ocean ridge vents. Another source is extraterrestrial such as meteors and meteorites. Many meteorites and comets are known to have organic compounds for crying out loud.</p>
<blockquote>[b]And hydrogen?  We know that hydrogen does not exist as an element on this planet: it escapes into space very rapidly due to its low density.[/b]</blockquote>
<p>This is just WRONG, they are LYING to you. Hydrogen can escape the CURRENT atmosphere(and the temperature of the atmosphere determines the rate of escape), but the fact that hydrogen does not exist on the earth IS WRONGGGGGG. 10% of you is the element hydrogen. Hell, Hydrogen makes up 10% of the worlds ocean by mass, or 2.2 milligrams per litre, it also makes up 2.5 milligrams per kg of the earths crust. But perhaps they meant hydrogen gas? Hydrogen gas is MUCH rarer (and keep in mind this is NOT what they said) but hydrogen gas can and does exist in the atmosphere, but because it can escape it is extremely trace. It is much more common in the atmosphere in the form of water vapor.</p>
<p>Geochemists speculate that the primordial earths atmosphere had between 0.1 and 0.01% hydrogen by mass, much more than what it is today, and even at this low percent ammino acids can still be formed in a significant amount although much lower.</p>
<blockquote>[b]Various other alternative atmospheres have been proposed, but these either don’t generate the materials required or are faced with similar problems to those mentioned for Miller’s work.[/b]</blockquote>
<p>Another example of this website LYING to you or them simply being WRONG. Without going into too much detail, several versions of the Miller experiment have been performed since 1953, the most recent 2008 one was done with trace amounts of oxygen for crying out loud and still produced amino acids! The idea that the experiment is invalidated unless the original atmospheric conditions were used is simply wrong.</p>
<p>The rest of the article is way more complicated than it needs to be, possibly to throw amateur sceptics such as my self off, I’m sure they know that most of their readers don’t have degrees in chemistry. I’d rather skip it, but I’ll do my best to debunk what I can.</p>
<blockquote>This, they claim, over extended periods of time could synthesise the required chemicals. But this overlooks something important.
<p>Basically, this argument is saying,</p>
<p>Raw materials  +  Energy  ⇒ Life molecules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, that is not what the argument says. This is a strawman.</p>
<blockquote>But this omits an important factor. In any process that leads to complexity there must be an information source. For example, in photosynthesis a complex system involving chlorophyll captures energy from the sun and uses it to build molecules from raw materials. Can you imagine shaking a flask containing the basic materials for the production of life (amino acids, sugars, nucleotides, fatty acids, etc.) and continuing to do so until life appeared?  That is essentially what we are requiring in an undirected synthesis of this type. “Shake it more vigorously and for longer” is not an encouraging command!</blockquote>
<p>The only people who say “any process leading to complexity must require an information source” are the people writing the article. The analogy of comparing photosynthesis to shaking a flask is a false one. The shaking the flash scenario is a strawman.</p>
<p>The yield issue. The article brings up problems with yield, but do not account for the other dozens of variations of the miller experiment under various differing conditions. I cannot do the math and I doubt 99% of their readers can either.</p>
<blockquote>Wrong forms of amino acid
<p>But there is a more fundamental problem with this scenario which can easily be overlooked. Amino acids, like all chemicals, are three-dimensional structures.  The arrangement of the central carbon atom is tetrahedral (figure 2).  In the diagram you will see two versions of this.  Unless you are used to studying these sorts of arrangements, you will think they are the same; it would seem that you could just rotate one to get the other.  This is not, in fact, the case.  We compare them to our hands: right-handed and left-handed. A left-handed glove will not fit on a right hand, for example.</p>
<p>Does this matter?  The answer is a very loud “Yes!”.  In nature, we only have left-handed (levo) amino acids.  (Glycine mentioned above is an exception; it does not have two forms – make a model and you will see why!).  Miller’s experiment gives a mixture of both forms but nature requires the levo form only. Again, does it matter?  Functional proteins cannot contain more than traces of right handed (dextro) amino acids. Right-handed forms (dextro) can have very different, even fatal, effects in some circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[list]<br>
[li]In nature, we only have left-handed (levo) amino acids.[/li][/list] - Just fucking WRONGGG<br>
[list][li]Miller’s experiment gives a mixture of both forms but nature requires the levo form only.[/li][/list] - Just fucking WRONGGGGG<br>
[list][li]Functional proteins cannot contain more than traces of right handed (dextro) amino acids.[/li][/list] - Totally correct. Nah, I’m just fucking with you. WRONGGGGGGGG[/ul]</p>
<p>May I present as evidence, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramicidin" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">the Gramicidin protein</a>! You will note that it uses 8 L-Amino acids and 6 D-Amino acids. So much for “proteins CANNOT contain more than trace right handed amino acids”.</p>
<blockquote>It is not a simple process to separate them and there is no natural system that can do so.  In fact, L-amino acids have a tendency with age to undergo a chemical inversion to the D-form. This is called racemization.</blockquote>
<p>This is VERY misleading, and WRONG. Yes, L-amino acids will change into the D- form, but the opposite is true, D-form amino acids will change into L-form amino acids. It is misleading as well because the rate at which they change depends on the circumstances. The fastest amino acids can change is if you place them in hot water. If however the conditions are cold or dry, and the amino acids are attached to each other, or even a mineral, then the change will be very, VERY slow.</p>
<p>Additionally the earliest life would have used both handed amino acids.</p>
<p>The article brings up RNA,</p>
<blockquote>There has been no experimental indication of the formation of either RNA or DNA in a Miller-type synthesis.</blockquote>
<p>The argument from ignorance fallacy right here.</p>
<p>There’s also a few arguments from authority at this point.</p>
<p>I would like to point out that, none of what they said in the article “proves” the Miller-Urey experiment wrong. As I said earlier, the Miller-Urey experiment wasn’t so much surprising because of the steps they did or the results they got, it was surprising because they showed that you can get some of the key building blocks for life from a relatively simple process, and over the years have shown time and time again that altering the atmosphere and testing conditions you can get similar results. Also note I don’t prove the article wrong. I simply state some errors they made, and I’ll list them below.</p>
<p>They state that the earth has had an oxygen atmosphere “since the earliest times”, this is wrong.<br>
They state that the atmosphere wouldn’t be stable, they were wrong.<br>
They, rather hilariously I might add, state that there is no hydrogen on earth AND ARE ABSOLUTELY WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG.<br>
They state that any change of the atmosphere in the Miller-Urey experiment and they wouldn’t get the same or similar results, they were wrong.<br>
They state that R-Amino Acids cannot be found or used in nature, they were wrong.<br>
They mislead people by stating that L-Amino Acids change into the R- type, but neglect to mention that the reverse is true, and that the speed of change is extremely dependant upon the conditions around the amino acids.</p>
<p>So, hopefully I’ve demonstrated that a lot of what that article states is bunk. If anyone out there manages to read this whole thing, pat yourself on the back, you deserve it!</p>

<p>I believe I have read about this before. I remember that they said that DNA has “switches” which you can turn on and off inside of a genome. These switches is what cause different traits that may make an animal better adapted to their environment. Then by reversing these “switches” they are able to reverse the progress of evolution. iirc they took a chicken which has 21 tail segments as an embryo, but when the chicken is born, it has 3. They were able to increase the 3 segments to 5 or something like that.<br>
