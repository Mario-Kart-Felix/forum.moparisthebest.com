        <p>Do you guys not realise the simple answer for this? We are here on earth to merely exist and evolve and populate. The same goes for any animal.<br>
I somewhat believe we came from a common ancestor, and it is one of my beliefs that we came around on an asteroid right about the time the dinosaurs went extinct. (It would make more sense then coming from some god). If I went and said there was a spaceship you go to if your good, made by an alien who is all powerful, and his son went to pay for our sins, would you believe me?</p>

        <p>[quote=“m1lkman, post:122, topic:438243”]I understand where you are coming from tL. I respect it, I really do. What you are saying is that there has to be other life out there besides our own because the Universe is so huge. It’s the same way I feel about God. I have witnessed and heard miracles happen. I look outside on a beautiful day and see all these wonderful things happening at once and I know in my mind that there is something controlling all of this. It’s difficult to describe.</p>
<p>Maybe my viewpoint will change when we find organisms on another planet and maybe your viewpoint will change when something miraculous happens and there is no other way to explain it.[/quote]<br>
If something is controlling the good parts then surely it controls the bad parts too? And if it does, then why would you follow it?</p>
<p>Also look I can do bible speak too! Lo and behold, for the sun doth come up from the east daily, but the earth darkens for evermore!</p>

Holy shit. I just read some more of the comments in this thread.</p>
<p>There is a vast misunderstanding of what evolution actually is. It’s astounding and explains why people refuse to believe it. Because they don’t understand it at all.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Please explain what evolution actually is. I don’t understand it at all. I need you to tell me.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’ll start with the two things you have said:</p>
<p>First, the crocodile thing. Evolution does not have a goal, it’s merely a process that favours those born with more favorable characteristics for their environment. Slight genetic mutations could mean a cat could run slightly faster than others of the same species, that is more likely to be able to catch prey faster than others, it would be able to outrun predators better and thus be able to survive for longer, and in turn more likely to reproduce to pass on that gene.</p>
<p>Similarly, a cat of that species is born with a characteristic that hinders it, it means it likely won’t survive as long and perhaps won’t reproduce to pass on that gene. Evolution isn’t about getting to an intelligence like us, a shark is just as evolved as us, and is perhaps far better suited to it’s environment to us, so in some respects evolution has favoured that.</p>
<p>Being like humans is not a goal of evolution. Intelligence suited our ancestors and thus it prevailed over other characteristics, and was continually passed down and improved upon because of how it made is successful in our environment. A crocodile is as much aspiring to be a human as we are aspiring to be a crocodile, in evolutionary terms. A crocodile is very well suited to it’s own environment and is a successful hunter.</p>
<p>However, that is not to say evolution is perfect. We carry vestiges, sometimes negative ones from our evolutionary past that the natural selection process has not got rid of, yet. Our wisdom teeth, for example. We don’t need them, sometimes, if they grow - they can become painful and ruin the straightness of our teeth and thus have a detrimental effect on the effectiveness of a bite. Wisdom teeth are like they are because our ancestors (over the past few million years) had smaller skulls but with larger jaws and used those teeth to break down plants, like we see gorillas do now, they’ll chew plants on those back teeth.</p>
<p>But as our jaws shrunk, as our diets changed, those teeth are no longer useful but haven’t disappeared completely. Not for all of us. However, they are slowly being removed from the gene pool, more and more people are being born without wisdom teeth every year, that is evolution. However small it may seem, that is what evolution is, loads of tiny little changes over millions of years. We don’t randomly give birth to a whole new species every now and again, like some people seem to believe. Thankfully, us, as humans, live in a society that is counter to natural selection. We look after those who are born with disabilities, we don’t dominate the weak as other animals do because of our intelligence and our understanding of each other.</p>
<p>On your other question, why are apes still around if we evolved from apes. That is a misunderstanding. We didn’t evolve from the apes that are around today, we evolved from a common ancestor.</p>
<p>So there was one species of animal millions upon millions of years ago that we all share ancestry with, but different environments, different conditions had us all split off into different species. We are still part of the ape family, and gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos, etc, they have evolved with us and they are dominant in their environment, but they are, like us, still evolving. Their evolution will be dictated more by natural selection than ours though.</p>
<p>Evolution is a fact, and is accepted as so among the scientific community. Including those who are religious, they perhaps reconcile evolution with their belief in that God started the process. I don’t believe in any God, so I don’t accept that, but I would much rather people accept science and continue their belief than assume science, despite it being humanities greatest tool, you use it’s results every single day, the paper your bible is written on was a result of science, is out to get them. Everything we know as true is through scientific process, even if it seems far away from the advance sciences today.</p>
<p>Look up the DNA evidence, look up the the vestiges we carry due to the evolutionary process, look at the vestiges other animals carry due to that process, look up the fossil record (but, really, the DNA evidence is strong enough that even if we didn’t have such a strong fossil record, it wouldn’t mater), look around you!</p>
<p>What do we do with dogs? We breed them in select conditions with select partners to get the best characteristics for a breed. <span class="bbcode-b">That is evolution</span>. It isn’t evolution through natural selection, but it demonstrates the process rather well.</p>

        <p>I was joking about the whole crocodile and ape thing in case you were wondering. But you guys will just call me a religious nutjob trying to cover his ass so I’m not going to try and argue the matter.</p>

<p>Could you link me to some statistics that state humans are being born more and more without wisdom teeth.</p>

<p>Evolution isn’t a fact. The only way it could be proven a fact or a law is if humans traveled back in time to observe the first living molecule. It’s a theory, no matter how much evidence is thrown on top, it’s still a theory. A theory is explaining <span class="bbcode-b">how</span> something occurred. A law is saying that something exists. Gravity, Motion, etc.</p>
<p>I believe in science. Science meaning chemistry, life science (reproduction), evolution (I believe in adaptations to the environment and that God built each creature to adapt. I don’t believe that everyone and everything evolved from a single molecule), and other sciences.</p>
<blockquote>Look up the DNA evidence, look up the the vestiges we carry due to the evolutionary process, look at the vestiges other animals carry due to that process, look up the fossil record (but, really, the DNA evidence is strong enough that even if we didn't have such a strong fossil record, it wouldn't mater), look around you!</blockquote>
<p>As for the similarities in DNA evidence. Look at an architect’s work. Every building that architect has designed has some similarities. The same applies with God. He created man, but he also created apes. Hence the similarities in DNA.</p>

        <p>So what you’re saying is, our DNA is going to be similar to that of a crocodile or a fish?</p>
<p>Even if you “went back to observe the first living molecule”, you most likely wouldn’t be able to actually observe evolution, since it isn’t exactly a process that happens in a short span.

</aside>
<p>I’m saying that it isn’t uncommon to see similarities in DNA because all things were created by one being. I’m not going to pretend I’m a DNA expert but I’m sure you will find some similarities between fish and crocodiles.</p>
<blockquote>Even if you "went back to observe the first living molecule", you most likely wouldn't be able to actually observe evolution, since it isn't exactly a process that happens in a short span.</blockquote>
Yes I know. I was just giving an example of why evolution isn't a fact. If you want me to be specific I will. Go back in time, see the first molecule, flash forward 1 million years and see what has grown, continue until you get to the present.

<p>Black people could have adapted to their environment while some moved to europe where they adapted.</p>
