        <p>m1lkman seems to be sooo deep in that shit. Answer this one question Mr.Religious, Where the fuck is God? Is it in the space monitoring us via surveillance cameras? I wonder why the bible focuses on earth only. Earth isn’t the only planet in this universum, and there is most likely life on other planets too.</p>
<p>I believe in a cup, I pray to a cup everyday, I prayed that I would get a friend, and one day a nice person comes to talk to me, Wow it worked! That’s exactly how it is with God too, and makes no sense.</p>
<p>I could go on, but I gotta take a shit and then probably go pray to a cup so I might get that car I want, then have a nice unprotected sex with my girlfriend.</p>

<p>Oh really? There is life on another planet? Link me to that please.</p>
<p>Christianity is a faith. You have to have accepted Christ as your personal savior to enjoy everlasting life in heaven. You cannot go to heaven through works. If you go to church, it’s a wonderful thing but you won’t be saved. You can end world hunger but that won’t mean anything unless you are saved.</p>

<p>Christianity is a faith. You have to have accepted Christ as your personal savior to enjoy everlasting life in heaven. You cannot go to heaven through works. If you go to church, it’s a wonderful thing but you won’t be saved. You can end world hunger but that won’t mean anything unless you are saved.</p>

<p>stupid thread.</p>

<p>It’s stupid thread if you are &lt; 14 and very ignorant or otherwise retarded child.</p>
<p>What I think the bible is for, is to answer the questions for questions like why are we here, or where do we go after death. It’s to stop us thinking of them, to keep us ignorant. Who knows, it might be a big ass conspiracy(not claiming that it is, I’m just keeping my mind open to all the possibilities).</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/nasa-finds-new-planet-kepler-22b-outside-solar-system-with-temperature-right-for-life/2011/12/07/gIQAPfzFdO_story.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/nasa-finds-new-planet-kepler-22b-outside-solar-system-with-temperature-right-for-life/2011/12/07/gIQAPfzFdO_story.html</a></p>
<p>There are more discoveries like that, I came back to link u that so you probably could get that head up from your ass.</p>

<p>It’s habitable. They say it can sustain life but NO WHERE in the article does it say that their is life on this planet. Once again, even though it sounds really great, you are believing in something that simply does not exist, life on another planet. You’re being incredibly hypocritical. You denounce my faith and replace it with your hope of life in another planet. I don’t care what a scientist “believes”.</p>

</aside>
<p>Hahaha. At least there’s logic behind my statements, there’s no logic at all in the bible or whatever you believe in. If you could open your mind for a second and do a little more research, maybe you could get that head up from your ass. Sorry if I keep saying that but it’s so true that I have to remind you about it.</p>

You’re calling me hypocrite yet you don’t see that you are a big one yourself, whenever I state something that could possibly prove bible wrong, you ignore it completely and tell me that I’m hypocrite. Those things that you said are just coincidence, I mean israel becoming a nation? SERIOUSLY? that’s the best evidence you can get?</p>
<p>There is a reason why I don’t wanna listen to your stories about how the Christianity is true, because it just sounds so damn stupid, there’s no logic behind it whatsoever. I haven’t made up any ‘facts’, you christian people are all the same, you can’t open your mind for some odd reason and act very hypocrite when ever someone tries to prove you wrong.</p>
<p>If you did not get what the logic behind my argument was then here it is:</p>
<blockquote>Do you really think that earth is the only planet with life in this universum, milkyway is 1 of many galaxies, and each galaxy probably has life on them. Don't be such a retard now.</blockquote> The space is really big place, there's more room for life than just on earth. Go read this and try to figure out how many planets there are. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy
<p>On a side note; I never thought someone could be so deep in that shit and manipulated/brainwashed so bad…<br>
Even my cup theory makes more sense</p>
