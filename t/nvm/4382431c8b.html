<p>Then again, we evolved into what we are today around 2 million years ago, so it may have been warmer/colder. Wasn’t my main point, I just found it odd. The main thing that I find odd is the coincidental  mathematical numbers in our DNA. Also the fact that our DNA implements a checksum into checking for corruption in DNA. afaik no other natural occurrence uses a checksum to catch errors. Yeah, it seems radical, but people thought the world being round was a radical thought. I mean, you would obviously fall off if you were on the bottom. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>We only know the function of 2% of our genome. (<a href="http://www.psrast.org/junkdna.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>first problem of that article,</p>
<blockquote>Presently, only the function of a few percent of the DNA is known, the rest has been believed to be useless garbage, commonly called "Junk DNA" by molecular biologists.</blockquote>
<p>yes, molecular biologists may call it “junk dna” but they do not believe that junk dna is “junk”, you see, names like “junk dna” and “the big bang” don’t describe the functions they name, they are often names coined to best describe a function to someone who does not have years of experience in that field of science so that they may, some what accurately, understand what the function is</p>
<p>allow me to explain,</p>
<blockquote>Increasing evidence is now indicating that this DNA is not "junk" at all.</blockquote>
<p>scientists never claimed junk dna was junk, you see, the actual name for junk dna is noncoding dna, dna which does not code into protein, and of which much of the functions of noncoding dna are UNKNOWN, so what you have here is an article attacking the assumption that junk dna is “junk” and “useless”, when actual scientists do not call junk dna junk or useless</p>
<p>quoting from wikipedia(don’t like it? go fuck a goat):</p>
<blockquote>Much of this DNA has no known biological function and is sometimes referred to as "junk DNA". [b]However, many types of noncoding DNA sequences do have known biological functions[/b], including the transcriptional and translational regulation of protein-coding sequences. [b]Other noncoding sequences have likely, but as-yet undetermined, functions[/b] (this is inferred from high levels of homology and conservation seen in sequences that do not encode proteins but, nonetheless, appear to be under heavy selective pressure). [b]While this indicates that noncoding DNA should not be indiscriminately referred to as junk DNA, the lack of sequence conservation in a majority of noncoding DNA with no known function indicates that much of it may indeed be without function.[/b]</blockquote>
<p>too long didn’t read: junk dna isn’t junk, it’s a term used to describe a function to an average person who may not care for, or understand the full mechanics of that function as described scientifically</p>
<p>earlier I mentioned “the big bang”, did you know that the name for the big bang theory was coined by a scientist who opposed the theory? you see, the big bang isn’t a bang or an explosion, it’s an expansion of space and time, and even today the big bang is still banging, that is, the universe is still expanding</p>
<p>but back to your original point, how is it “more probable” that aliens, or a god designed us? you guys like to call it “intelligent design”, but where exactly is the intelligence of wisdom teeth? they cause a lot of pain for many adults and offer no benefit, a natural explanation such as the theory of evolution can explain this because they DID serve a purpose for our ancestors, but if humans were designed by an entity then it’s quite clearly BAD DESIGN</p>

<p>What I meant by my post was, saying he is a history denialist isn’t a fair analogy since something like ww1 is documented with photos etc where as the “mechanics” are unclear on both sides, just how the universe came into existance, simply because science today says it was made this way and I deny it on the grounds that I think it is more likely that a God did it doesn’t mean I’m denying history, it means I’m not comfortable putting 100% faith in a field that once laughed at the thought of a round earth, and up until recently thought the universe was static.</p>

</aside>
<p>scientists (typically) weren’t the ones claiming the earth wasn’t flat, it was the church you fucking dope</p>
<p>just because you don’t know how science works, let me clue you in</p>
<p><img src="http://weirdsciencekids.com/images/Scientific_Method.gif" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>I’ll walk you through the steps,</p>
<p>Ask question: “why is that rabbit in my garden?”<br>
Do background research: “I’ve seen rabbits in my garden before, perhaps they want food”<br>
Construct hypothesis: “perhaps this rabbit is in my garden looking for food”<br>
Test with an experiment: “I will place food in my garden”<br>
Analyse results: “the rabbit did not eat the food”</p>
<p>Our hypothesis is false, therefore we will try again</p>
<p>Construct hypothesis: “around this time of year I’ve seen rabbits fuck like, well, rabbits, perhaps the rabbit is here to mate?”<br>
Test with an experiment: “I will place a female rabbit in heat in my garden”<br>
Analyse results: “the rabbits fucked like rabbits”<br>
Report results: “I saw a rabbit in my garden, I hypothesised that the rabbit was looking for food, after placing food and noticing the rabbit was not interested I hypothesised that the rabbit was looking for a mate, so I placed a female rabbit in heat in the garden and the rabbits fucked, therefore I present a theory that the rabbit in my garden was looking to fuck, based on the observation that rabbits usually fuck around this time of year and based on the experiment that after placing a female rabbit in my garden, they fucked”</p>
<p>so when scientists say that the earth is round, they do so based on observations backed up by experiments(observe: the shadow on the moon during a solar eclipse is round) (experiment: walk around the pissing earth), and historically it was the church that was against the round earth theory, the same way the church was against the earth orbiting the sun (and therefore not the centre of the universe)</p>
<p>and even today, some members of the church are opposing evolution and the theory of evolution, of course others members of the church(read: the smart and educated members of the church) aren’t as ignorant as other fucktard members of their faith, and actually accept the theory of evolution as a valid explanation for the diversity of life</p>
<p>ps, big hint, the big bang theory doesn’t state where the universe came from, the big bang theory states that the universe was once an extremely dense, extremely hot singularity that expanded, we currently observe that the universe is expanding and if we look with our telescopes(further you look, the further back in time you are looking at) we can observe that the younger the universe was the hotter and smaller it was, back to the point where the universe was 380,000 years old and was so hot that the universe was opaque to light (the absolute furthest we can look back), we know the universe was opaque to light because of the observation of the cosmological background radiation, no matter WHERE you look, there is ALWAYS a background radiation that is the same temperature with minor variations, this discovery was a big milestone for the big bang theory because the big bang theory predicted the very same thing</p>
<p>and here’s a picture of the background radiation - <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/WMAP_2010.png" rel="nofollow noopener">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/WMAP_2010.png</a></p>
<p>you know, that’s a pretty fucking important picture right there</p>

I don’t think I said they had, only that it could be proved.<br>
They have been able to produce rDNA from non-living materials from what I know. I will check it up later.</p>

<p>I’d like to see the source.[/quote]</p>
<p>but since you asked so nicely, yes you fucking fucktard, scientists HAVE created amino acids from compounds and they did so in 1953, it’s called the miller-urey experiment and <a href="http://www.chem.duke.edu/~jds/cruise_chem/Exobiology/miller.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here’s your fucking source, too bad you’re 59 years too late, you might have had a convincing argument 60 years ago</a></p>

<p>it doesn’t go against evolution, the theory of evolution or natural selection, further, who says the transition of less fur/hair means our lives is any “harder”? you’ll find many south american and african tribes wear little in the way of clothing, and usually it’s for a ceremonial reason and not to keep warm</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That post that I posted like two more says a town just north of cape cod has an average minimum temperature of -6.1ºC. Now obviously there are warmer temperatures, but I’m also sure those tribal members don’t go to sleep with no coverings. And I bet they cover with animal fur. Again, not my main argument. I just found it odd, and as you stated it may have been a bad adaptation, which I didn’t really think of. Guess women just found hairless guys more attractive.</p>
<p>[quote=“Niall, post:205, topic:438243”]it wasn’t “pure luck” that got us to where we are now, in fact, you quoted the process yourself, it’s called “natural selection”</p>
<p>and as it happens, humans aren’t the only “intelligent” animal, there are several species which show signs of intelligence[/quote] Agreed, yet they aren’t having nuclear warfare either. And yes, natural selection means the strongest and better equipped creatures will survive. Why has no other species adapted a more intelligent brain (yes you said some animals are intelligent, like dolphins and chimpanzees. I guess they could just be behind and be catching up) yet? There’s millions of species of animals on the earth. I just feel that we shouldn’t and wouldn’t be the only ones to develop a more comprehensive intelligence. Also some scientists believe that chimpanzees aren’t really understanding language, but just performing tasks for rewards. Basically the same thing when we tell a dog to sit or roll over and then give them a treat.<br>
<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-491089/Washoe-speaking-chimp-dies-aged-42.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">source</a></p>
<blockquote>But claims about Washoe's language skills were disputed by scientists who believed that language is unique to humans.
<p>Among those who doubted that chimps could use language were linguist Noam Chomsky and Harvard scientist Steven Pinker.</p>
<p>Chomsky contended that the neural requirements for language developed in humans after the evolutionary split between humans and other primates.</p>
<p>Pinker said primates simply learn to perform certain acts in order to receive rewards, and do not acquire true language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[quote=“Niall, post:205, topic:438243”]we didn’t lose “our fur” or hair for the purpose of us to go kill animals to wear their fur, we don’t even need to wear animal fur or even clothes to survive</p>
<p>if you want to view it as a retrogress, what part of you think that it goes against evolution, the theory or evolution or natural selection? changes bought forth by evolution do NOT have to be good, in fact most changes are neutral, and some can even be harmful(diseases, anyone?)[/quote] Where I live, I would die rather quickly without proper clothing in the winter. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I see what you mean, though. We could use our intelligence to create a fire or perhaps be limited on where to live. And, also I did not think about harmful adaptations, such as diseases.</p>

<p>how are we unique? no, I’m serious, please fill me in</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not sure if unique is the best word, as each species is unique in its own way, but we definitely are different. As I said earlier, scientists predict we have 18 unique genes inside of our genome. I believe they have found 4 definite ones iirc. Then again, I haven’t looked into how many other organisms have unique genes, so that argument may be flawed. One such famous gene is the FOXP2 gene. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP2" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">wikipedia</a>). iirc other organisms have that gene, although only one has it on the same degree of function as we do or something like that. Been a while since I read it, but I believe it was a bat and it still isn’t on the same degree of importance for speech as it is in us.</p>
<p>[quote=“Niall, post:205, topic:438243”]first problem of that article,</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>Presently, only the function of a few percent of the DNA is known, the rest has been believed to be useless garbage, commonly called “Junk DNA” by molecular biologists. </p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>yes, molecular biologists may call it “junk dna” but they do not believe that junk dna is “junk”, you see, names like “junk dna” and “the big bang” don’t describe the functions they name, they are often names coined to best describe a function to someone who does not have years of experience in that field of science so that they may, some what accurately, understand what the function is[/quote] Yes I know it isn’t junk and I never said it was actually junk. I said they do not know the purpose of them as they do not inscribe proteins. There was an article I read about a guy that proposed they do have a function and did quite a bit of research on it. A lot of scientists applauded his discoveries, but they still decided it was inconclusive.</p>

<p>[quote]Much of this DNA has no known biological function and is sometimes referred to as “junk DNA”. <span class="bbcode-b">However, many types of noncoding DNA sequences do have known biological functions</span>, including the transcriptional and translational regulation of protein-coding sequences. <span class="bbcode-b">Other noncoding sequences have likely, but as-yet undetermined, functions</span> (this is inferred from high levels of homology and conservation seen in sequences that do not encode proteins but, nonetheless, appear to be under heavy selective pressure). <span class="bbcode-b">While this indicates that noncoding DNA should not be indiscriminately referred to as junk DNA, the lack of sequence conservation in a majority of noncoding DNA with no known function indicates that much of it may indeed be without function.</span></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>too long didn’t read: junk dna isn’t junk, it’s a term used to describe a function to an average person who may not care for, or understand the full mechanics of that function as described scientifically[/quote] You basically quoted and bolded that they don’t understand what it exactly does, which is what I said.</p>
<p>[quote=“Niall, post:205, topic:438243”]earlier I mentioned “the big bang”, did you know that the name for the big bang theory was coined by a scientist who opposed the theory? you see, the big bang isn’t a bang or an explosion, it’s an expansion of space and time, and even today the big bang is still banging, that is, the universe is still expanding[/quote] Sorry to go off on a tangent, but recently scientists have discovered that we are currently expanding even faster rather than the opposed slowing down. I find this really interesting. I also wondered, before when they thought the expansion was slowing down, that if this wasn’t the first “world”. For example it would explode then go back to a point and then explode again and ect. And what if the same thing happened every single time. So like there was a Niall previous to this one that had this discussion before and there will be one again in the future having the same discussion. I guess this wouldn’t be the case with the new discoveries, but perhaps they are wrong again? <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>[quote=“Niall, post:205, topic:438243”]but back to your original point, how is it “more probable” that aliens, or a god designed us? you guys like to call it “intelligent design”, but where exactly is the intelligence of wisdom teeth? they cause a lot of pain for many adults and offer no benefit, a natural explanation such as the theory of evolution can explain this because they DID serve a purpose for our ancestors, but if humans were designed by an entity then it’s quite clearly BAD DESIGN[/quote] I guess if aliens designed us, nobody is perfect. Or perhaps we didn’t have wisdom teeth at first and it was a bad adaptation.</p>

<p>Thats not my point though, just that it never ends, and both sides for some reason dont seem to accept each others ideas (theres always that one person who jumps in and disagrees with an opinion) which usually doesnt just start an debate or something, goes and the people discussing move it on to other topics, then they start flaming, and yes it has happened quite a few times ive seen at least<br>

<p>Sure does help, though. There’s, what? 7 billion or so humans living now. It could arguably be the best adaptation for any situation, for you are able to problem solve. Most definitely the most adaptable for solving a multitude of problems. And there were other species of hominids at the time of the beginning of our evolution. iirc there was a time when 3 hominids would live in the same area (I believe I posted source earlier, if not I’ll find one or you can do your own research and see what you find). Why were we the only ones that survived and thrived?</p>

        <p>You are defining success based on our own advantages though. There are plenty of other species that breed more, breed faster and breed easier, and thus spread their genes and adapt to their individual environment faster.</p>

        <p>Most people say about 6 million years ago with the missing link when the hominid species developed.</p>
<p>“But even then, we’re giving nature goals. Nature does not have a goal, at least not one that is evident anywhere.”<br>
Which is why I find it odd that we were the only ones that developed this way. Nature doesn’t have a goal, so it, in a sense, is random on what adaptations you develop. Maybe not entirely random, but how you adapt to overcome the problem to survive, is. So why are we the only ones that went along the intelligence path? Like I said, there’s millions of species probably on this earth. I even tried thinking of maybe an organism that had a unique function. My first thought was a bull shark, as they are able to go into freshwater to lay their eggs to provide a safe place for their young to grow. Yet, there is another fish that has this same adaptation, called a sawfish. That is why I think it is just highly unlikely that we just happened to develop the way we have. Also the fact that they have proposed 18 unique genes (or however many it was, it was in the teens) is quite astounding. That may not seem like a large number, but if you take in the fact that there is millions of genes in a single genome, it becomes quite staggering.</p>

really “fucktard” twice? dang you must mean business, no wonder you are ex-staff,[/quote]</p>
<p>read this in the most snobby voice you can: for your information (ok, you can stop now), every member of staff that was kicked off was also banned for their actions, being stripped of title and rank at the same time(an example would be jdb, who exploited a function in smf and created several administrator accounts he gave to people)</p>
<p>I resigned willingly on the other hand, after being fed up of literally babysitting moparscapers</p>

<p>humm, trruthinscience, what could this be?</p>
<blockquote>Truth in Science is a United Kingdom-based creationist organization which promotes the Discovery Institute's "Teach the Controversy" campaign.</blockquote>
<p>oh, they’re the discovery institute branch for the uk, oh dear</p>
<p>still, I’m sure they’ll give honest information that isn’t biased, and is fair for both sides of the argument, right? guise?</p>

<p>seriously though, the page you quoted is one of several variants of an argument by jonathan wells (also a member of the discovery institute, see the problem here?) whom published in a book against evolution, the book is generally regarded as utter nonsense and what he says against the miller-urey experiment(and what is on the page you linked) is also complete and utter nonsense</p>
<p>I’ll make a proper post debunking that page later tonight, I spent the better part of 3 hours researching and providing links to post in this thread but after hitting refresh and not preview I lost all of it, all I will say now is the experiment wasn’t “proven wrong”</p>

Intelligence isn’t what evolution is about. Intelligence can come out of evolution, but it isn’t necessary for survival.<br>

Sure does help, though. There’s, what? 7 billion or so humans living now. It could arguably be the best adaptation for any situation, for you are able to problem solve. Most definitely the most adaptable for solving a multitude of problems. And there were other species of hominids at the time of the beginning of our evolution. iirc there was a time when 3 hominids would live in the same area (I believe I posted source earlier, if not I’ll find one or you can do your own research and see what you find). Why were we the only ones that survived and thrived?[/quote]</p>
<p>I had several(well, 2) paragraphs written out about Neanderthals which related to why not every species is “smart”, the simple fact is we don’t know why Neanderthals went extinct, we do know however that Neanderthals at the time required 100-350 more calories than equivalent modern humans, coupled with a lack of resources and competing with humans, it’s likely humans killed or bred out the Neanderthals</p>

<p>well, religion HAS been behind many of the worse atrocities committed in history, it’s not a matter of religion being a scapegoat if religion was the cause</p>
