        <p>Honestly I am no preacher or anything of the sort, I barely even listen in church I sleep more or less.</p>
<p>But he part that “he loves us” is indeed true, that’s why he would want us to follow the rules. And like in life if you don’t follow the rules problems happen, If you murder someone I believe hell is a nice place for them to go?</p>

<blockquote>Adam and Eve - they only had sons; they're going to repopulate with their mother? In fact - one was murdered by his brother.</blockquote>
There are others on the Earth at this time.
<p>Eve had another son, called Seth. Seth’s bloodline can be traced to Jesus.</p><blockquote>And there was also a son born to Seth, and he called his name Enos. Then men began to call upon the name of Jehovah.</blockquote> Genesis 4:26.
<blockquote>The "God created the universe in seven days" theory, research the big bang theory. Why? It makes a whole lot more sense and you'll learn something.</blockquote>
<p>The Big Bang Theory and evolution are both religions. You can argue that fact all you want but in the end it is still just as likely that God created the heavens and the earth.</p>
<blockquote>Also, show me proof that Jesus actually existed; so far [from what I've researched], there's no proof at all than what other the Bible states.</blockquote>
<p>If there was hard evidence that Jesus existed would you believe in him?</p>
<p>I’d like to point out that the Bible isn’t a bunch of hooey.</p>
<p>Jeremiah prophesied that the Mongols would come and attack Babylon,</p>
<blockquote>For, lo, I am stirring up and bringing up against Babylon a company of great nations from a northern land. And they shall array themselves against her. She shall be captured there. Their arrows shall be as those of a skillful, mighty man; none shall return in vain.</blockquote> Jeremiah 50:9.
<p>Isaiah predicted that Israel would once be recognized by other nations.</p>
<blockquote>Who has heard a thing like this? Who has seen things like these? Will the earth be brought forth in one day? Or will a nation be born at once? For Zion travailed and also brought forth her sons.</blockquote> Isaiah 66:8

Whether or not you follow the Bible, you should at least know;<br>
Evolution &gt; Creationism.<br>
Big band theory &gt; Seven days theory.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I LOVE it when people say this. Explain how evolution and the big bang theory were created.[/quote]<br>
Evolution; it started with an organism. Those organisms would multiply eventually multiplying one that would adapt to the surrounding environment. Then when that organism would multiply, it’s offspring would also attain that adaptation. Eventually, all the remaining organisms without the adaptation would die off having the species with the adaptation continue to carry on. The cycle repeats. We all started out microscopic at one point.</p>
<p>Big bang; there are many misconceptions surrounding the Big Bang theory. For example, we tend to imagine a giant explosion. Experts however say that there was no explosion; there was (and continues to be) an expansion. Rather than imagining a balloon popping and releasing its contents, imagine a balloon expanding: an infinitesimally small balloon expanding to the size of our current universe.</p>
<p>Another misconception is that we tend to image the singularity as a little fireball appearing somewhere in space. According to the many experts however, space didn’t exist prior to the Big Bang. Back in the late '60s and early '70s, when men first walked upon the moon, "three British astrophysicists, Steven Hawking, George Ellis, and Roger Penrose turned their attention to the Theory of Relativity and its implications regarding our notions of time. In 1968 and 1970, they published papers in which they extended Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity to include measurements of time and space.1, 2 According to their calculations, time and space had a finite beginning that corresponded to the origin of matter and energy."3 The singularity didn’t appear in space; rather, space began inside of the singularity. Prior to the singularity, nothing existed, not space, time, matter, or energy - nothing. So where and in what did the singularity appear if not in space? We don’t know. We don’t know where it came from, why it’s here, or even where it is. All we really know is that we are inside of it and at one time it didn’t exist and neither did we.</p>
