    <description>hello,

I have no idea how to add customs to client or server - heres the problem tho

I have two clients the first 1 is normal with cache in it and some customs already added.
The second client that i have is coded to auto download the cache but.. the problem i have is it does not have all the items added that client #1 has which makes those items invisable to people on the webclient or players wearing the items invisable to people on the webclient.

Could some1 help guide me throught the steps to add customs from #1 to #2 client please.
I have absolutly no experience in adding customs yet but would love to learn.

thanks,
dgk</description>

              <p>ok then, you could have just said so. The ints are easier, but only if you know how to use them. He switched from delta, and a lot more people know about using delta. I’m going to have to respectfully disagree with the " if someone doesn’t know that shouldn’t start" statement, as people aren’t born knowing it.</p>

              <p>Okay then all mighty I vain I. I sincerely apologize for attempting to “help”. Help means to assist by the way, I figured it isn’t in your vocabulary after looking at some of your posts. As a matter of fact, adding models to pi is different. One reason is that most bases have a class 8, Pi doesn’t. Also, the ints are different than, delta, for example. dgk went from delta to pi, so it is in fact different. Raw is the only option unless you want to go into dat packing, when most other servers have a convenient model folder, which throws a lot of people off. The fact that PI pre-loads is a different, as some server don’t. Maybe think about the little things that throw the less experienced players off before rubbing your esteem in their faces. Not all of us can be so lucky as you.</p>
<p>dgk, I think I might have found your problem, pm me.</p>

<p>Anyways, I saw that your source is, in fact PI. Yea, PI has way better combat, but adding models is a real pain. The major problem of course is the fact that the model input and ints. are way different. First of all, do you have all the correct ints.?</p>
