    <title>Error: could not find or load main class server.server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-could-not-find-or-load-main-class-server-server/548568</link>
    <description>ive been working on this a bit now. i was trying to make my deathly pkz pi client work so i could use it with my different source and so i changed the server ip in my client.java to local host 127.0.0.1 and saved it. the client still didnt work so i figured i&#39;d try to get the compiler working. After following the guide to setting my EV this is the error i get when trying to compile.
[code]Error: Could not find or load main class server.Server
Press any key to continue . . .
[/code]

This is the code for my compiler and i got it from following the guide to setting Environmental variables .
[code]@echo off
title Server
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_25\bin/java.exe&quot; -Xmx800m -cp bin;deps/poi.jar;deps/mysql.jar;deps/mina.jar;deps/slf4j.jar;deps/slf4j-nop.jar;deps/jython.jar;log4j-1.2.15.jar; server.Server
pause[/code]

This is the client&#39;s run-bat:
[code]@echo off
java -cp bin -Xms512m -Xmx624m client 10 0 highmem members 32
pause
[/code]

The client will currently load when i run it but it says error connecting to server, please try again in 1minute. when i try to login.
i Figured it is because i changed the clients ip to local host but have not got the compiler to work yet/
any help is appreciated 

Edited: in case it is needed when setting EV this is what i did
CLASSPATH = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_25\bin;%CLASSPATH%;
PATH = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_25\bin;;%systemroot%\system32</description>
