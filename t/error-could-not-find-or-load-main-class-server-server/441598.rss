    <title>Error: Could not find or load main class server.Server</title>

    <description>Hello

I&#39;ve been trying to get this to work for a few days but i haven&#39;t been able to succeed. At the moment i&#39;m really stuck on this, and i&#39;m about to delete everything. I have done everything that i could think of. I run it from a[b] linux VPs (centOS)[/b] and its a PI source.

[code][root@core-server RSPS]# sh run.sh
[b]Error: Could not find or load main class server.Server[/b][/code]


This is my run.sh ( i have no idea if it has something to do with this, but i&#39;better post to much information than less  ;D)
[code]java -Xmx512m Server[/code]


Friendly greetings

Darry !</description>
