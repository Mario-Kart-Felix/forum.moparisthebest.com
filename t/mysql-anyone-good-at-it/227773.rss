    <title>Mysql: Anyone good at it?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mysql-anyone-good-at-it/227773</link>
    <description>Hey, and this is one of my only times asking for help.

Anyone good at mySQL?
And, if your here just to say &quot;omFG, I&#39;m not&quot;, don&#39;t bother posting please.

If you are any good at mySQL, I might have a job for you. (It could pay in the long run)

I don&#39;t need someone who is the best at mySQL, just someone who can do things such as highscores, databases etc.
Although, if you are really, really good at it, then I guess you can post ;)</description>
