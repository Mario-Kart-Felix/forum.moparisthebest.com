    <title>[508] Changing a client into a .jar file [508]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-changing-a-client-into-a-jar-file-508/356589</link>
    <description>So yeah, I have a 508 client that I have customized to my liking.  I tried doing all of it and I am having to much trouble.  So I was wondering if any1 on these forums would like to do it for me.  I will give you rep+ and put your username/whatever nickname you would like, on the client.  The client has a really cool design, so it is worth while to have your name on it.  Sorry if this is the wrong section for this and thanks.  :)  AND IT IS AN IP CHANGER AND I NOT SURE HOW T MAKE IT NORMAL IP

(And remember people who want to give me nasty comments, I have already tried many times to make the jar, so this is why I want someone to do it for me.)</description>
