              <p>When I look at the page, I get confused as to what I’m actually supposed to be looking at. Your panes for ‘Play Now,’ ‘Download,’ and ‘News’ are all the same size. My eyes don’t really know where to go or what to focus on. What’s more important? Sharing news? Playing the game? Downloading it? Now pick one, and have the other two as equal, but lesser importance. Design your layouts around importance and emphasis.</p>
<p>I would question what’s going in the img scrollbox area. Assuming it’s some sort of news scroller, I would recommend you either have a main news pain or the scroller, not both. If it’s anything else, it’s running into that size issue like the other panes. Consider making it smaller.</p>
<p>That’s all I have for now, other than what’s been said.</p>
