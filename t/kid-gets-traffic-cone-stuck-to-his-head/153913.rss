    <title>Kid gets.. traffic cone stuck to his head?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/kid-gets-traffic-cone-stuck-to-his-head/153913</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;To Charlie Thomas, it must have seemed like a wizard idea.

Spotting a discarded traffic cone, the imaginative three-year-old immediately saw its potential as an impromptu Harry Potter outfit.

But after placing it carefully on his head to show his family, the magic soon disappeared.

The plastic cone became firmly stuck and despite the best efforts of the toddler&#39;s parents, it refused to budge.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
