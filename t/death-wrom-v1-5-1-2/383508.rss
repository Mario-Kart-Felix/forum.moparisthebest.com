    <description>Death Worm is a creature just trying to be heard by its own kind, in order to do that you must eat as much as you can to grow in size and allowing the others to hear your desperate calls for help.

Troubleshooting

This software has been tested extensively to ensure it will operate correctly on all systems that meet the minimum system requirements. If you experience any problems such as system crashes or error messages, try one of the following:

1) Update your computer&#39;s sound card and video card drivers. This can be done by identifying the type of sound card and video card your computer is using and finding the manufacturer&#39;s web site where new drivers may be made available.

2) Upgrade DirectX. This is a Microsoft component and can improve the graphics, security, and performance of your Windows operating system. Nearly all problems encountered with T&amp;S games can be solved by updating DirectX.

<p>Thanks man. I liked this community so I decided to give you guys the first look. This is the free version but soon there will be a ton of updates such as 3D graphics and a great storyline. We are currently trying to work a deal with sony, so we will see how it works out</p>

<p>I was once part of the GM community and Death Worm was the first thing I saw when I went to that page over 2 years ago, and I am sure you did not make it. I’ve also seen a flash version of Death Worm done before. But who knows… maybe you did make it.</p>
