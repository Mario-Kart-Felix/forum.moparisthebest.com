    <description>Ok, at school yesterday me and my friend were just playing about insulting each other he said my dad was a lesbian so i said &#39;at least I have a dad!&#39;  And which at this point i didn&#39;t know that my friend&#39;s dad wasn&#39;t acctually alive... I get to school today and it turns out I&#39;ve been suspended for it, WTF ?! Does anyone else here think that this has been an incorrect punishment? :D</description>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I really don’t understand why you bothered to post.</p>
<p>Anyways, what I would do is probably go to the guidance counselor or whoever deals with things such as suspensions. Your main goal here is to explain to he/she what really happened, and try to get her to understand your side of the story. If this person is really going to be so offended by this when you had no idea, then going to the school about it wasn’t very mature either. If he really was your friend, he would’ve talked to you about, and you would probably apologize.</p>
<p>Like Daviddude said, how can they suspend you without discussing things like this with you? If they think they can, that’s a lot of bullshit. A school should not be able to punish someone until both sides of the story has been heard. This is true in some schools, <span class="bbcode-i">sometimes</span> mine, but not all.</p>

              <p>If you were bullying him because he didn’t have a dad, then it would of been right for you to get suspended, but if he’s you’re friend, why would he tell a teacher ? Tbh, chill for a a few days, and just have a quiet word and say you’re sorry, and you didn’t realize, and i’m sure he won’t be that bothered.</p>

              <p>He probably got to school today was called down and was told. It depends if he was really your friend and if you were really just messing around. I know a kid who was suspended for 9 days because he was joking around and said  “Don’t blame me if the school blows up.” So be careful what you say before you say it. Also I would recommend going and talking to them.</p>

<p>You have to be careful with whom you are saying that sort of stuff to, even if you think you are just messing around. I don’t have a dad and I wouldn’t care at all if someone decided to joke around with that.</p>
