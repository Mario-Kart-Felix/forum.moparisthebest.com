    <description>Move if wrong section. 

Here is a copy of the quick play around I had with Pokemon as I was coming up with design ideas and techniques for my 2D game creator.

Download link: [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?quz0btfvlocxocj]Pokemon.rar[/url]

Includes:

[ul]Netty Networking - Single Player (Must implement a channel handler for multiple clients)[/ul]


[ul]Clipped Palette Town (Hard coded positions)[/ul]


[ul]Changing between regions (Route 1 - Palette)[/ul]


[ul]Biking (Press B in game)[/ul]


[ul]Sprites updating movement[/ul]


[ul]Start to Pokemon Battle[/ul]


Things to note:

[ul]For some reason the Jpanel for the battles does not request focus. Would appreciate if someone told me what I happened to do wrong there. To get it to work, simply minimize the application and open it.[/ul]


[ul]The map loads as a whole and is the center of positioning. The map does not move with the player. For best results play in full screen.[/ul]


[ul]Walking system is a complete joke. Rewrite that is a must[/ul]


[ul]Performance wasn&#39;t a giant thought during the start with movement and images, that system should be revamped if you wish to future develop this[/ul]


[ul]Code isn&#39;t A+++++++++++++++ * 100000000000 quality. Didn&#39;t write it intending so. Was just playing with it, first time with 2D graphics for a solid mini project[/ul]


This has the do whatever the hell you want license. Hope it helps people that wanted to do a Pokemon 2D game or whatever.

Clipped Palette Town.

Area directly below this is the only active wild area. Also note that route 1 is not clipped.

Minimize this screen and reopen it when it pops up to make it focus-able. You can move between Fight - Bag - Pokemon - Run with the arrow keys. Pressing enter on Run will run from the battle. Other options were not completed. 

Press B in game for biking.
