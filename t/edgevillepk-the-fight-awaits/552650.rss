[b][size=16pt]Server Goals:[/size][/b]

We plan to provide an interactive PvPing experience for players of all sorts. As a PvP dominant server we plan to have content based around PvPing. EdgevillePK intends to be a spawn server but with restrictions. We will have donator ranks for those who choose to have access to many features, but we will not become a P2W (pay to win) game where the donators get lifted restrictions on combat effecting spawnable items. 

To start with, we will provide a PK skill that will unlock access to certain items within shops that are not spawnable. Such items in this store can be accessible of two ways being: 1, either the player can get the proper PK skill and the right amount of PK points to purchase the item from the shop, or 2, the player can achieve the proper prestige to unlock the items to spawn. Every kill in PvP will give a calculated amount of XP towards the PK skill and a calculated amount of PK points. Such calculation will depend on a number of variables, but once that algorithm is written I will explain it in more detail. 

The server will also feature a Burncard system. Now for those of you who never played Titanfall, burncards are PvP modifiers that change the way PvP is handled whether it be &quot;amped&quot; weapons or spawning next to the enemy who just killed you. Of course these are just examples of existing modifiers in Titanfall and will most likely not be added exactly to the word in our system.

To add onto the Prestige system, every time a player hits level 99 in the PK skill, the player will have the option to level up their Prestige. Each prestige will unlock a variety of items that will aid in the success of ones&#39; PvP experience. These items may range from cosmetic to actual combat effecting items. Each prestige, they will also get a free Burncard pack which will have chances of dropping certain &quot;rares&quot; or whatever we want to call it. There will also be different burncard packs which will be offered as donation rewards. Each increased prestige level will increase the percentage of XP you get in the PK skill.

Loadouts are another favorite of most PvP styled games. We will provide 6 default loadouts that players will be able to select before engaging in PvP activities, but also with the leveling up of the PK skill and Prestige levels, players will gain access to custom loadouts where they will be able to drag and drop items they wish to become their custom setup of gear in PvP.

More information will be provided upon completion of all of these systems with their designated interfaces.

[b][size=16pt]Notable Features:[/size][/b]
Prestige System
Burncard System
Custom PK Skill
Loadout System
OnDemand Services

As soon as I have more information for you guys, I will supply it for you, but in the meantime please be patient. We plan to release in 9 days (August 3rd, 2015. I will have media up within the next few days. Thanks for your patience.

I’m sure some will ask about Skarred-Lands. First and foremost, it’s not being released. Worse comes to worse it’ll be placed in backlog while I’m here (But not forgotten).</p>

              <p>For anyone that doesn’t know me, I’m known as Ruby around the RSPS scene but I’ve not been involved for a while. Used to own a few 400-600+ servers back around 2011-2012 time. I started out in the scene as a website designer, moved into development and programming web sided. I’m just getting my first web solutions company off the ground and about to open up my own marketing company. When it comes to professionalism and business sense you won’t find many more like me so I was speaking with Stuart and I’m gonna make some time for the project as a website developer on the back-end stuff and a kind of business co-ordinator. Making sure targets/deadlines etc are hit.</p>
<p>I currently work 90 hours a week all-in between the companies so it’ll be a squeeze, but I’m sure I’ll manage. Stoked to be back into it and especially in a team that’s as dedicated to professionalism, can’t wait to see where we go with this. Keep your eyes peeled ladies and gents!</p>

              <p>So I recently took full control of EdgevillePK and some people have come and go. Rash isn’t 100% on whether or not he’ll be able to commit to what he once was before, but we’ll cross that road when we get there. Looking to find some interested developers who want to learn along side with me and who are interested in getting a unique and content packed PK server out there! Let me know if you’re interested.</p>

A lot is coming along. I have ran into a few bugs regarding our killfeed system. It seems somewhere in our client, there is a mask being applied to some inventory items that causes a blue color to show up in the bottom right half of the image. When the killfeed system draws the image of the item that was used to kill a player, it shows the image but also the blue.</p>
<p>For now I’ve to just not draw the image for now until we find a proper fix for the problem.</p>
<p>Also all we really have left is to fully implement all of our burncard ideas into the client and server, including combat modifiers. I am finishing up adding item restrictions to the server as well when it comes to spawning certain items within each unlocked prestige.</p>
<p>ALSO!!, have to thank a friend from rune-server who is working on a unity3D version of the client, he happily provided us with a screenshot we plan to use on our website and the client loginscreen.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">[size=16pt]Server Goals:[/size]</span></p>
<p>We plan to provide an interactive PvPing experience for players of all sorts. As a PvP dominant server we plan to have content based around PvPing. EdgevillePK intends to be a spawn server but with restrictions. We will have donator ranks for those who choose to have access to many features, but we will not become a P2W (pay to win) game where the donators get lifted restrictions on combat effecting spawnable items.</p>
<p>To start with, we will provide a PK skill that will unlock access to certain items within shops that are not spawnable. Such items in this store can be accessible of two ways being: 1, either the player can get the proper PK skill and the right amount of PK points to purchase the item from the shop, or 2, the player can achieve the proper prestige to unlock the items to spawn. Every kill in PvP will give a calculated amount of XP towards the PK skill and a calculated amount of PK points. Such calculation will depend on a number of variables, but once that algorithm is written I will explain it in more detail.</p>
<p>The server will also feature a Burncard system. Now for those of you who never played Titanfall, burncards are PvP modifiers that change the way PvP is handled whether it be “amped” weapons or spawning next to the enemy who just killed you. Of course these are just examples of existing modifiers in Titanfall and will most likely not be added exactly to the word in our system.</p>
<p>To add onto the Prestige system, every time a player hits level 99 in the PK skill, the player will have the option to level up their Prestige. Each prestige will unlock a variety of items that will aid in the success of ones’ PvP experience. These items may range from cosmetic to actual combat effecting items. Each prestige, they will also get a free Burncard pack which will have chances of dropping certain “rares” or whatever we want to call it. There will also be different burncard packs which will be offered as donation rewards. Each increased prestige level will increase the percentage of XP you get in the PK skill.</p>
<p>Loadouts are another favorite of most PvP styled games. We will provide 6 default loadouts that players will be able to select before engaging in PvP activities, but also with the leveling up of the PK skill and Prestige levels, players will gain access to custom loadouts where they will be able to drag and drop items they wish to become their custom setup of gear in PvP.</p>
<p>More information will be provided upon completion of all of these systems with their designated interfaces.</p>
