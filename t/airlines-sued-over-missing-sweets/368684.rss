    <title>Airlines sued over missing sweets</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/airlines-sued-over-missing-sweets/368684</link>
    <description>I read this on my local newspaper today.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Senior lawyer and former Nominated Member of Parliament Shriniwas Rai, 65, took Air India to court on Nov 1… because he felt ‘frustrated’ and was very upset at the turn of events on March 21 when he and his wife, after landing at Changi Airport, realised they had left a bag containing three boxes of sweets on the aircraft.

The sweets, bought in New Delhi, were gifts for relatives here, he said…(He) was advised (by Sats) to go to Air India’s office at the terminal.

There, he was told by an Air India officer that no bag, as described by Mr Rai, was found on the plane. But when he was about to leave the office, he spotted a box of the sweets with its contents half-empty, according to court papers filed.

An airline official whom he then spoken to apologised and said that the sweets had been consumed and the remaining two boxes had been given to the crew.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

              <p>Thread is now about people making mountains out of molehills. Post away!</p>
<blockquote>In Cleveland a law student from Case Western Reserve University filed a lawsuit against Reserve Square Apartments after claiming that his apartment there was infested with bed bugs.
<p>The student, Joshua Bobrowsky, 26, is looking for $142,000 to cover the damages. He said that everything he owns is infested and three different apartments have left him with painful welts from being bitten. On top of that he has had months of emotional and psychological distress because of the infestation. Bobrowsky has said he is unable to sleep because of the bed bugs and that life is no longer enjoyable.</p>
<p>A lawyer representing Reserve Square Apartments is investigating Bobrowsky’s claims. No other tenants have complained of bed bugs.</p>

They really are. Tons of lawsuits are filed, barely any get passed. A while ago there was a clothes iron someone burned themselves with because they tried to iron the clothes while they were wearing them, they sued the company also.</p>
<p>People try to make easy money here by taking advantage of the system, sadly that doesnt work past unemployment and welfare.</p>
