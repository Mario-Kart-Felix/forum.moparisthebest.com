              <p>yo dong, go to your client folder, look for sign, then go to signlink.java, then look for “File_store” no “”. then if it is that, then just do this “goodvbad_file_store_32” without the “”. then you will need to chat the file_store_32 in your cache file to goodvbad_file_store_32 as well. but now if you want other people to be able to download your cache when they run the webclient. do this… go back to singlink.java and change your “goodvbad_file_store_32” to “C:/goodvbad_file_store_32” without the “”. and then all you will need to do is put your cache which is goodvbad_file_store_32 in your c:/ drive and there u go! Hope this helped. =p</p>
