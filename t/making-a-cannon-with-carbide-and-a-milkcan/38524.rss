    <description>Ok, first of all I would like to say that this tut is made by me  :cool: :rolleyes:. Second, if you do this make sure you dont stick your head in front of it or you could get a severe headache. Now lets start!

Requirements:
Carbide
Milkcan (look below if you dont know what it is)
chain or rope or whatever that is at least 5 meters long (the longer the safer, if you use a small chain/rope be sure that you are not close to the milkcan).
water
torch

Milkcan:

Step 1.
Get your milkcan, and drill a hole in it. Not too big, just about 0.5 - 1cm.

Step 2.
Get the lid of your milkcan, and put a chain/rope on it and make sure its a knot that wont come loose quickly.

Step 3.
Go to a garden, piece of land or whatever where you have enough space.

Step 4.
Put a piece of carbide in the milkcan.

Step 5.
Add some water to it, but really not much. If its right it goes fizzy a bit. Also, there is coming gas from the carbide now.

Step 6.
Quickly put the lid on, and put the milkcan on the ground.

Step 7.
Make sure nobody is infront of the milkcan. If there is nobody, hold the torch at the hole you drilled in the milkcan at step 1 and watch/hear the bang.  :P

Note: The picture below shows what happens if you put too much water in, still nice though.
