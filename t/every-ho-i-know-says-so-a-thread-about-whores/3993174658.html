        <p>Well I know this just from sort of general knowledge around London. I’ve also watched a lot of UK/US police shows and theres a pretty big correlation between drugs, need for money, and prostitution. A few minutes of searching and I discovered these stats. Also, I’m aware that the way prostitutes operate from country to country is always going to differ according to laws laid down.</p>

 The Journal of Sex Research by John Potterat:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>we interviewed 237 prostitutes in the community and 407 comparison women at an STD clinic. Drug use was more commonly reported by prostitutes than comparisons (86% vs. 23%), as was non-consensual prepubertal sex (32% vs. 13%). Sexual- and drug-related milestones occurred in the same order in both groups, with drug use preceding sexual activity and injecting drug use preceding prostitution. Ninety-four percent of prostitutes who injected drugs reported noninjectable drug use before prostitution, and 75% of prostitutes who injected drugs reported doing so before beginning prostitution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This survey was taken in the US.</p>

 The syphilis epidemic in Connecticut: relationship to drug use and prostitution:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>As syphilis rates rose, there were large increases in the percentage of women with syphilis who reported prostitution or illicit drug use. In 1988, 41% of women with syphilis reported cocaine use, and 19% reported prostitution; 21% of male heterosexuals with syphilis reported cocaine use, and 31% reported sexual contact with prostitutes. Among incarcerated women, syphilis infection was frequent: of 113 women incarcerated for possession of illicit drugs in 1987-88, 7% were found to be infected with Treponema pallidum, and of 187 women incarcerated for prostitution in these years, 14% were infected.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>From what I can read specific to Sweden and other Scandinavian countries is that you have some of the toughest drug laws in the EU, perhaps that is why there is not such a clear link, but there is a big link between prostitution and human traffiking there. I read that there is a big prostitution/drug link in Malmo, but no evidence to support it. The internet is crammed with data on this relationship, hundreds and hundreds of journals on it.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s different where you are, but afaik, in most countries the link between drug abuse and prostitution is very clear…</p>
<p>EDIT - I quickly found this document which has some stats on prostitution in the UK <a href="http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=808" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=808</a></p>
<p>Some interesting links also between domestic abuse and prostitution.</p>

<p>From what I can read specific to Sweden and other Scandinavian countries is that you have some of the toughest drug laws in the EU, perhaps that is why there is not such a clear link, but there is a big link between prostitution and human traffiking there. I read that there is a big prostitution/drug link in Malmo, but no evidence to support it. The internet is crammed with data on this relationship, hundreds and hundreds of journals on it.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s different where you are, but afaik, in most countries the link between drug abuse and prostitution is very clear…</p>
<p>EDIT - I quickly found this document which has some stats on prostitution in the UK <a href="http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=808" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=808</a></p>
<p>Some interesting links also between domestic abuse and prostitution.[/quote]Now, if you go down to the roots of this issue, what would your conclusion be? Mine would be that by putting a stigma on being a prostitute and segregating them from society is causing crime and other issues to rise.</p>
<p>If it was strictly controlled just like any other business there would be no problem. That will most likely not happen though, thanks to deeply rooted christian values. Contrary to popular belief and propaganda, not everyone is forced into prostitution. There’s plenty of people who enjoy their job and make a fuckload of cash doing it! (too many puns to count in that sentence).</p>

        <p>I personally see drugs as the root. If there was no addiction to drugs like heroin, then there would not be a need to sell your body for sex. Same for other people who rob to feed their drug habit. Take that addiction away, and perhaps robbery cases drop? idk. I think the reason why a lot of young women become prostitutes is to feed their habit of drug taking. Maybe the stigma that comes with being a prostitute is down to the blatent relationship of drugs and recieving money for services, which is very widespread across the world.</p>
<p>I’m not saying all prozzies are drug addicts, as it’s clearly not the case, but I do believe that the vast majority of prostitutes do sell their bodies for reasons they feel they are forced to.</p>
<p>Yes, maybe some women love sex so much that they are happy to sleep with these sleezy men who crawl roadsides or pick up call girls, but I believe that most woman are forced in to it by their situation.

<p>I do agree that controlling prostitution would bring lots of benefits to society, and I also agree with you on the whole christian and religious values preventing this from actually happening on a global scale. iirc, prostitution in Italy has been a recognised part of society for a few hundred years, mainly because it is seen as a shady business, rather than drug fiends dieing for their next hit.</p>

        <p>I’m not saying having sex for money is bad at all…I feel sorry for these woman that have to sell their bodies in order to fulfill their needs, whether it be feeding a drug habit, or feeding their children. What I do find bad is that the use of harmful and dangerous drugs forces a lot of women in to selling their bodies, when, in another situation, they probably wouldn’t.</p>
<p>I can’t speak for prostitutes here, but it is my opinion that when addiction feeds the ‘sex workers’ profession, then clearly there is not a place for that in society…</p>
<p>Mopman, I agree there will always be a demand for sex. Whether a woman wants to sell herself to this demand is up to her, not society.</p>
<p>I’m not attacking the sex workers here, I think my point is being missed slightly. There’s no problem, imo, with the act of selling yourself for money. I do have a problem with drugs and other criminal activities largely fueling this ‘industry’. I’m not sure who’s to blame, whether it is the women putting theirselves in this position, or whether it is the demand for them. I sway towards the demand for them, but 6 of one, half a dozen of the other in some cases…</p>

        <p>Sex for money is fine… yet you feel sorry for them because they do it?</p>
<p>Would you feel equally sorry for someone who is forced to do non-sex work? If so, do you realise that practically everybody in our society is forced to work because otherwise they would not be able to buy food.</p>
<p>Yes we agree being addicted to drugs is bad, but that has nothing to do with sex workers so stop confusing them.</p>

<p>Some of them are, which is why having proper legislation and unionizing them is a good thing. Once criminals don’t have anything to say anymore in the prostitution, normal business men (they are slightly perverted I guess, but still) can take over and make sure these women are safe and make a decent living.</p>
<p>Prostitutes save us from a lot of bad things, I guess. Some men have a lot of tension, and need to get rid of it. I’d never visit one, but I guess some men need it.<br>

<p>I feel sorry for the women who are forced in to prostitution due to their circumstances, not women who choose to sell theirselves for sex. But again, me feeling sorry for someone isn’t my point…</p>
<p>And yeh, people are forced to work for food. My mum and dad are forced to work for food and shelter for the family. My mum, afaik, isn’t forced to sell her body for sex in order to feed her heroin addiction.</p>
<p>I think you’re wrong when you say drug abuse has no link to prostitution. This is my whole argument and you seem to brush it off with one sentence…Never have I said being a drug addict makes you a prostitute but there is a clear link, as shown in stats above, that a lot of prostitutes sell theirselves specifically to feed addiction. That is all I’m saying…</p>

<p>They’re pretty good at controlling people who are in a position which can cause them to endanger the health of others, though.<br>
After all, I assume you’re happy with the fact your doctor has to be licensed in order to practice?</p>
<p>I don’t think the state should control prostitution in the sense that they should set prices or anything that invasive, but an enforced licensed set of standards would be good for everybody. Regular STD checks and such.</p>

<p>Im with chris on this one, although I don’t really care. I don’t associate myself with them or deal with them so it shouldn’t matter to me. Live and let live.</p>

        <p>Prostitution is a service, just like window cleaning is. Both branches can be criminalized. And just like any other service branche, you need an organisation that makes sure that both consumers and the providers of the service are protected.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Mr</span>. Chris: If women are forced into prostitution because they can’t fulfill their needs, it’s the fault of another system, not the fault of prostitution. I don’t have any numbers to back this up, but I have a strong feeling the prostitutes in the Netherlands are either forced to do it by traffickers or they do it because they enjoy it (or the money). We have proper health care, the poor get help, so there’s no need for a Dutch woman to sell her body in order to feed her children or pay bills. So in order to get rid of the women that are prostitutes because they are forced by traffickers, you need an organisation that comes up with rules, and enforces them.</p>
