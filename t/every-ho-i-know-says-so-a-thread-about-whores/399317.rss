    <description>I move in some far-left circles and one of the up-and-coming movements is an effort to unite and unionise sex workers and have them strive for more acceptance in society.
Was wondering what you all think of this video.

I have to say I was surprised at how different some of them looked from what I imagined typical hookers looked like.</description>

              <p>Prostitution is a service, just like window cleaning is. Both branches can be criminalized. And just like any other service branche, you need an organisation that makes sure that both consumers and the providers of the service are protected.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Mr</span>. Chris: If women are forced into prostitution because they can’t fulfill their needs, it’s the fault of another system, not the fault of prostitution. I don’t have any numbers to back this up, but I have a strong feeling the prostitutes in the Netherlands are either forced to do it by traffickers or they do it because they enjoy it (or the money). We have proper health care, the poor get help, so there’s no need for a Dutch woman to sell her body in order to feed her children or pay bills. So in order to get rid of the women that are prostitutes because they are forced by traffickers, you need an organisation that comes up with rules, and enforces them.</p>

<p>And yeh, people are forced to work for food. My mum and dad are forced to work for food and shelter for the family. My mum, afaik, isn’t forced to sell her body for sex in order to feed her heroin addiction.</p>
<p>I think you’re wrong when you say drug abuse has no link to prostitution. This is my whole argument and you seem to brush it off with one sentence…Never have I said being a drug addict makes you a prostitute but there is a clear link, as shown in stats above, that a lot of prostitutes sell theirselves specifically to feed addiction. That is all I’m saying…</p>

<p>Some of them are, which is why having proper legislation and unionizing them is a good thing. Once criminals don’t have anything to say anymore in the prostitution, normal business men (they are slightly perverted I guess, but still) can take over and make sure these women are safe and make a decent living.</p>
<p>Prostitutes save us from a lot of bad things, I guess. Some men have a lot of tension, and need to get rid of it. I’d never visit one, but I guess some men need it.<br>

What I do find bad is that the use of harmful and dangerous drugs forces a lot of women in to selling their bodies, when, in another situation, they probably wouldn’t.</p>
<p>I can’t speak for prostitutes here, but it is my opinion that when addiction feeds the ‘sex workers’ profession, then clearly there is not a place for that in society…</p>
<p>Mopman, I agree there will always be a demand for sex. Whether a woman wants to sell herself to this demand is up to her, not society.</p>
<p>I’m not attacking the sex workers here, I think my point is being missed slightly. There’s no problem, imo, with the act of selling yourself for money. I do have a problem with drugs and other criminal activities largely fueling this ‘industry’. I’m not sure who’s to blame, whether it is the women putting theirselves in this position, or whether it is the demand for them. I sway towards the demand for them, but 6 of one, half a dozen of the other in some cases…</p>

<p>we interviewed 237 prostitutes in the community and 407 comparison women at an STD clinic. Drug use was more commonly reported by prostitutes than comparisons (86% vs. 23%), as was non-consensual prepubertal sex (32% vs. 13%). Sexual- and drug-related milestones occurred in the same order in both groups, with drug use preceding sexual activity and injecting drug use preceding prostitution. Ninety-four percent of prostitutes who injected drugs reported noninjectable drug use before prostitution, and 75% of prostitutes who injected drugs reported doing so before beginning prostitution.</p>

<p>This survey was taken in the US.</p>

<p>As syphilis rates rose, there were large increases in the percentage of women with syphilis who reported prostitution or illicit drug use. In 1988, 41% of women with syphilis reported cocaine use, and 19% reported prostitution; 21% of male heterosexuals with syphilis reported cocaine use, and 31% reported sexual contact with prostitutes. Among incarcerated women, syphilis infection was frequent: of 113 women incarcerated for possession of illicit drugs in 1987-88, 7% were found to be infected with Treponema pallidum, and of 187 women incarcerated for prostitution in these years, 14% were infected.</p>

<p>From what I can read specific to Sweden and other Scandinavian countries is that you have some of the toughest drug laws in the EU, perhaps that is why there is not such a clear link, but there is a big link between prostitution and human traffiking there. I read that there is a big prostitution/drug link in Malmo, but no evidence to support it. The internet is crammed with data on this relationship, hundreds and hundreds of journals on it.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s different where you are, but afaik, in most countries the link between drug abuse and prostitution is very clear…</p>
<p>EDIT - I quickly found this document which has some stats on prostitution in the UK <a href="http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=808" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=808</a></p>
<p>Some interesting links also between domestic abuse and prostitution.[/quote]Now, if you go down to the roots of this issue, what would your conclusion be? Mine would be that by putting a stigma on being a prostitute and segregating them from society is causing crime and other issues to rise.</p>
<p>If it was strictly controlled just like any other business there would be no problem. That will most likely not happen though, thanks to deeply rooted christian values. Contrary to popular belief and propaganda, not everyone is forced into prostitution. There’s plenty of people who enjoy their job and make a fuckload of cash doing it! (too many puns to count in that sentence).</p>

<p>Either way, sex workers should always be on the darker side of society, even today. It’s not a job, but encourages other illegal activities, such as rape. As well as rises in STI’s and accident babies like cumescape.</p>

              <p>[quote=“yakman, post:13, topic:399317”]Even if your religion says that you shouldn’t be a prostitute, I still don’t understand how you can tell other people you don’t even know what they shouldn’t be doing if its nothing to do with you.[/quote]I thought that would be obvious, all religions try to force their views on others</p>
