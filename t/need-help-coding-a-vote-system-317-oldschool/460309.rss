<p>With callback:<br>
1, player votes. If the player doesn’t vote, the vote can’t process. 2, vote is processed and it tells your site the player has voted while storing it to a database. 3, player logs in or types a command and receives the reward they voted for which accesses the database stored on your webhost. 4, the database entry is removed because the player has received their reward (not entirely sure on this, maybe it deletes in 24 hours, maybe it doesn’t delete at all… I have no idea).</p>
<p>Without callback:<br>
1, player doesn’t vote. 2, player logs in and receives the reward even though they haven’t voted.</p>
<p>That’s the explanation of the code. Now you have to implement it to work (what the tutorials give you - convert it to whatever base you’re using).</p>
