    <title>Need help with Wearing an item</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-wearing-an-item/524006</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;m trying to make it so when I wear this specific item on my server it increases hp, prayer and special attack, haven&#39;t done anything like this before so I need a bit of help.

This is what I put in WearItem.java, it didn&#39;t do anything though, just gave me a bunch of compiler errors. Not even sure if its possible it was just an idea, would be useful though.

[code]        if(wearId == 773) {
	c.getItems().updateSpecialBar();
	c.gfx0(2015);
	c.specAmount = 100000000;
	c.getPA().requestUpdates();
	c.playerLevel[3] = 99999999;
	c.getPA().refreshSkill(3);
	c.playerLevel[5] = 99999999;
	c.getPA().refreshSkill(5);
        c.sendMessage(&quot;&lt;col=1532693&gt;You feel the power flow through your body!&lt;/col&gt;&quot;);
