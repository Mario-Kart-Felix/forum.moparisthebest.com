    <title>Theres just that one case</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/theres-just-that-one-case/249146</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

I&#39;m looking for one packet in particular..
I really don&#39;t have a clue what it does, im guessing it is something to do with &quot;Clicking&quot;.

I remember a while back i found this packet; and i put inside it a teleportation method, then whenever you clicked anywhere it would just teleport you somewhere else.

Some people, i think, use this for freezing people if they having done something. I&#39;m not sure. But asd explained above, i think it is a packet which ahppens when you click to move.

Does anyone have an idea which ID this packet is?
Thanks! 

EDIT:

Think i found it myself, packets; 164 and 98.</description>
