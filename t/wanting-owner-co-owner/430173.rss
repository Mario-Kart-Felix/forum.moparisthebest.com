    <title>Wanting owner/co-owner</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wanting-owner-co-owner/430173</link>
    <description>Hey. I&#39;ve been playing runescape for 5 years, and RSPS for over 3. I&#39;m looking to be a owner, or co-owner with someone else. In exchange for this, I will host your RSPS 24/7 for free. Just need the information. I will most likely join any server, as long as it has a decent number of players. I will also play VERY often. I will be hosting with a intel i5 processor and 4gb of ram. Please reply! Thanks!!!  I HATEE PVP SERVERS...HATE!!!  ;)

thanks! -tooter365</description>
