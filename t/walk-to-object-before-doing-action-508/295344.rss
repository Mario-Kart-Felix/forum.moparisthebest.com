    <title>Walk to object before doing action [508]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/walk-to-object-before-doing-action-508/295344</link>
    <description>I would like to make a charatcer walk to an object after clicking it and do the action after walking.

I am trying to make the smithing interface popup when you click the furnace and after it walks to it.

Click on it, walk to it, open interface.

I know how to open the interface.

I working on a 508 btw. SkilledScape 508 base.
Thanks.</description>
