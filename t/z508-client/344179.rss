    <title>Z508 Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/z508-client/344179</link>
    <description>I was using a custom z508 client. I wanted to add godwars to server, i used ::tele to the coordinates, when i got their, bandos started attacking me and my client just closed so fast that i didnt even see it close. It also happen when i was in the wilderness when reverant dragon attacked me, it closed. i thought it was the mapdata. I got an error in the run client.bat. but i cant copy or take screeny cz it closes fast.
Anyway to fix it?</description>
