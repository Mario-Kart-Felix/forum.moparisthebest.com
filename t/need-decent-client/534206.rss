    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-decent-client/534206</link>
    <description>Hey, Im looking for a decent client, Or a quick way of fixing some issues with mine. A lot of stuff is messed up with GodWars in my client.
This is the client I am working with: http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-client/downloads/474034-updated-317-client-loading-474-data.html

Here are some photo&#39;s:

If anyone could link me to a decent client that had correct godwars and what not. That would be excellent.
Or if someone is able to assist me in fixing all of these issues, That too would be amazing!</description>
