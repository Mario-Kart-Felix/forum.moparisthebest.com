    <title>XBOX 360 Elite?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/xbox-360-elite/94924</link>
    <description>Is The Xbox 360 Elite Gonna Be Worth It I Dont Think Its Worth It because These Are the Things They have Added:
1.Its Black -.- (You can Just Mod Your Old One)
2.120GB HDD (You Can Add To Your Xbox 360 Anyway)
3.It Has A HDMI Port (Uhmmsame as Above and who cares)

Things Which Should of Been Added (More Important)
1.Wi-Fi Dear GOD!
2.HD-DVD
3.Can&#39;t Support 1080p STILL!
4.Better Stats (ITS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE XBOX 360 (Normal))
5.It Will Cost $480 And The Sony Say There PS3 Is Going Down By $100 Soon So I Dont See A Point In Buying The console.

Personaly I Think This Console Is A Waste Of Time And Money And
 if You Already Have One Just Get The Upgrade&#39;s)

Tell me If You Think Im Wrong

<p>Hmm lets see, i have Oblivion on PS3 and Xbox 360, you can see immediatly from the start that when you walk into the chains on the xbox 360, they dont move very smoothly, whereas on the PS3 they move realistically.</p>
<p>Also PS3 does have more features than the Xbox 360. I still love my Xbox 360 though <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
[/quote]<br>
That isn’t physics. It’s just animation.<br>
Physics would be like…a falling castle? (I don’t know a good example)<br>
Motorstorm has decent physics I admit, but a lackluster game overall. Hopefully they can polish up Motorstorm 2 to be a winnar.[/quote]<br>
Physics Is Like If I Throw A Grenade Next To You You Get Blown Away More Realisticly And If You Hit A Rock While Doing That You Go Off that Alot More Realisticly.</p>

<p>Also PS3 does have more features than the Xbox 360. I still love my Xbox 360 though :P[/quote]<br>
That isn’t physics. It’s just animation.<br>
Physics would be like…a falling castle? (I don’t know a good example)<br>
Motorstorm has decent physics I admit, but a lackluster game overall. Hopefully they can polish up Motorstorm 2 to be a winnar.</p>

Fair Enough...but then your just paying for it to be black.

This Was For Those People (Likely) Who Are Going To Buy An Elite Because They Think Its The Only One Which Can Have A 120GB HDD And Its Annoying.

I Connect To The Internet Through My Router Which Is WIRELESS ONLY NO WIRES! So I Dont Have A Choice Now Do I To Buy An Add On Which Connects By USB.

So I Have To Fork Out An Extra £130 For It Now Do I? And I Thought This Was The 'Elite' Console For The 'Hardcore Gamers'
<blockquote>[quote]3.Can't Support 1080p STILL![/quote]
Uh, yes it does. HDMI was added for trueHD (1080p)</blockquote>
Is This In Games Or In Movies As I Heard Different Dont Quote Me On This Though

It has the 120gb for basically $100 off. premium + 120gb drive = $580</blockquote>
Well Any New Thing Which The Normal Xbox 360 Cant Have Like You Can Install Linux On The PS3
<blockquote>[quote]5.It Will Cost $480 And The Sony Say There PS3 Is Going Down By $100 Soon So I Dont See A Point In Buying The console.[/quote]
SCE said the opposite. They said no pricedrops are foreseeable until mid-2009.</blockquote>
Ive Heard Different From Videos And Reports Etc.

So The Xbox 360 Had How Much Games At Launch And How Much Games Other Than Gears Of War Which Has Come Out A Year Or Two After Launch Which Where REAL Dineamite.

Well There Are Games Coming Out And It's Only Within The Last Year Any Truely 'good' (GOW) Games Have Come Out For The Xbox 360 Which Are JUST For The Xbox 360 As Many Of The Games Which Came Out First For The XBOX 360 Are Out For PS3 And You Have To Wait A Little Bit Before Going Off About It And Search For PS3's Version Of Second Life 'Home' Which Is Second Life Squashed Into Xbox Live

<p>The PS3 is literally a supercomputer. Check out the stats on Folding@Home, the PS3’s about 10-12 times more powerful than the average PC. There’s a problem with both the Xbox 360 and the PS3 though - the games (and software) cost money. Until they find a way to somehow channel software through some cracked-app server to the consoles, or something else, I’m not getting them <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Xbox 360 games are supprisingly more expensive than PS3 games which are just a little bit more than PS2 games from £35-50 whereas Xbox 360 games are like £40-50</p>

              <p>The PS3 is literally a supercomputer. Check out the stats on Folding@Home, the PS3’s about 10-12 times more powerful than the average PC. There’s a problem with both the Xbox 360 and the PS3 though - the games (and software) cost money. Until they find a way to somehow channel software through some cracked-app server to the consoles, or something else, I’m not getting them <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>Who needs other crappy consoles when you have a computer? PS3 is here atm like 600 euros, what a waste don’t you think? My computer has 300GB hard drive and bought 400GB more, computer+400GB more = 955 euros. Don’t buy new stuff, you’re dumb.</p>
