    <description>Hey all,

So I am going to be starting a unique RSPS. I will be providing a Dedi for testing, providing all the financial backing and also being the primary server developer. 

This is NOT your run-of-the-mill server where we use Project Insanity and rip scripts. This requires talent to join and we will be using a Hyperion base with a 474 client. This will require hard and talented work but it will payoff! Each position will get $100-$500 after we finish most of the developing and decide to host. From there on I will receive 60% of the profits (My share is also going to server and ad costs) and the rest will be split between you guys! 

We will be hosting with CyberBunker and using as much privacy at all costs. Advertising budget will be upwards of $3k. I plan on getting this ready for end of March if not earlier.

I have been programming for 5 years now with many different projects. 
Some examples here: https://github.com/mitchzinck

To join the team you must have something to show of your coding ability and you must be talented and hard working.

Requirements:

Forum/Site Guru (10% share - $100-300 payout) - You will be the manager of the forums. You will modify the forum software to our liking while also helping integrate the forum and the server. You must have good knowledge with PHP, MySQL and also HTML, CSS and designing. I can help with this too as I am also a web developer. You will also be making the homepage and custom pages for donating, voting etc.

Bitcoin Manager (10% share - $100 payout) - You will manage the bitcoin backend. You will write an api to withdraw and deposit bitcoins and also integrate it with user accounts. You must know your stuff about bitcoin security and also on how to securely withdraw and deposit bitcoins while keeping them safe.

Client Developer (20% share - $500 payout) - You will be providing custom tabs and custom client work (Objects, interfaces etc). Pretty simple and easy money if you are good at it.

You also will all be required to moderate the server and forums and also to help test the server.

If you think you are fit for the job please add me on skype:mitchell.zinck

It can be weekly if you want IDC. [size=36pt]Total pay before hosting will be what I mentioned in my post. If you want it in increments thats fine with me. If you want it all at once then I will pay you after we finish initial developing.[/size][/quote]</description>
