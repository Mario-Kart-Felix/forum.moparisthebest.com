    <title>Burthrope Games Room</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/burthrope-games-room/525020</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve never seen Burthrope Games Room in a Private Server. Do you think anyone would play it if it was 100% and you could stake people coins on any game type. In my opinion, it would add another aspect into the economy; players that are good at boards games would get rich from it. It would also compete with staking as a way to get fast money, but in a different way.

What do you think?</description>
