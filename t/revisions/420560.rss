    <description>this isnt really about my server or anything but dont flip your shit cause of this i just dont know where else to put it..

so i have always wondered, like why the numbers of a revision are what they are. like why does a 317, consist of the numbers 3,1 and 7. is it just a random guess for the number? or does it stand for something?</description>
