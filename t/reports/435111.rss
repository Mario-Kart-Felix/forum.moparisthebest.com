    <description>There seems to be a continual build up in the reports section, and general problems on the server. Now I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on for each person but I&#39;d like to request a few things. 

Firstly, can everybody please make a contribution to server reports and issues. If there is an issue you feel is being looked over don&#39;t hesitate to say something. 

Secondly, this adds onto the reports build up and general issues with keeping up with the server which is triggering myself and probably Zuppers a lot of hassle ingame, do we need anymore moderators for the server? I&#39;ve just had to do 6 reports by myself so if I&#39;m starting to think the answer is yes though I could be wrong.

Thirdly, why don&#39;t we have the teleport command for reports, I&#39;m not being funny but I got up at 8AM dealt with some issues on the forum, then had to do 6 reports which involved me walking the entire map multiple times. I can&#39;t even play the game anymore with all this walking and I&#39;m sure others feel the same.</description>

              <p>But it isn’t proven to be linked to the removal of the cacti fee is it? Honestly, I think it’s more because we updated to 1.1 over the fee being removed. The fee doesn’t do much if you’re correct anyway, it concentrates the damage on one world which could ultimately have a bigger effect (see: old world 1).</p>
<p>On an update note though, anyone want to bet on when we update next? I’ll put 1 diamond into the winnings ;D</p>

<p>But I also hate to be an “I told you so” but this is the exact subject I was talking about in the Cati thread. Secluding these newish players to W1 was an excellent filter system. Made the average noob grief ALOT harder. Less work for people if it was reinstated.</p>
<p>Also Is it possible to get the IP address posted as well. I see a lot of one time names I would like to “check” on but have no ip to check against.</p>

              <p>Little yet widely spread damage, as I’ve said most new comers don’t understand the concept of “I own this property” and just move into the nearest available house. I must admit I take great joy out of standing on my 3rd floor and shooting them as they come over the hill <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Once they’re in, they infest themselves into your property, like woodlice. Though a simple warning stating a few ground rules is more than sufficient for them never to do it again so a complete rollback of what they did within a specific time is complete over kill and usually results in them quitting the server.</p>
<p>A griefer is someone with intent to do damage, not these people. So in a lot of reports a radius rollback is better. If I did a any other rollback it would destroy their house they’ve spent the day making.</p>
<p>On another note, someones griefed Fuscates mob spawner and I restored it, the issue being it no longer works <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Allow me to assist you there, Zuppers.</p>

              <p>Most of the time I have to be in the area of the report to roll it back, annoying but what can you do? The problem is imo most of the report are not really decent reports. You get false,garbage,poor screenshot, reports all the time. Anyway as I’ve already said most of these reports seem be to floating around those 3 Turkish guys.</p>

              <p>It depends on the severity of what they’ve done, sometimes newcomers turn up and do things by accident so a radius rollback is required above anything. Sometimes anything other than a radius rollback can make the map look messy as well.</p>
