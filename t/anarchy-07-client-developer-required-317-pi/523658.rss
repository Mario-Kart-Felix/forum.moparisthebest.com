    <title>[Anarchy 07] Client Developer Required - 317 [PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anarchy-07-client-developer-required-317-pi/523658</link>
    <description>[u][b]The Project[/b][/u]
The project, Anarchy07, is an Old-school themed private server. It will revolve around the &#39;07 era but will not be a remake. We are, however, trying to influence a lot of &quot;remake traits&quot; such as quests and a strong economy. Not too much will be revealed on this thread because only the developers will have all the insight until release.

[u][b]What we need[/b][/u]
I need a client developer for my project that&#39;s going to be hosted on a VPS within 2 days. The team currently consists of myself as the server-side developer and another member who controls the website, community and finances. We require a developer who is capable of working with clients including: Jaring, Signing, Cache Downloading, Webclients and various other skills.

[u][b]Other information[/b][/u]
You must have Skype.
The current desired client is renamed/refactored
As being part of the staff team, you will be staff within the release of the server. You must be able to coexist with other members of the community as a role model and a leader. You must be polite and experienced in this field. A sense of humour would help too :)
We have a desired client that we want to be developed, unless you can state why using a different client would be better with valid proof.

If you wish to partake in this role, please first make sure that you meet all the requirements. Then post your Skype below, I&#39;ll add you and we can discuss whether you&#39;re right for the team.

Any other information will be posted upon request or discussed on Skype.

Good luck, can&#39;t wait to start working with one of you! :)</description>
