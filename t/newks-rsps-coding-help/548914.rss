    <description>I need help coding my Rsps private server. if you can help me code you will automatically be given owner and everything. if you are interested add skype name amandasmith14 and CALL ME. i will not have a coder who does not have a mic and cannot talk. thank you


Also the main trouble i have is when i add something into the files. like i tried to add a new donator command it says that there are errors that are completely unrelated to where i added in something new.</description>

              <p>First, programmer could easily <span class="bbcode-i">take</span> owner permissions, regardless of what you said. Why? They have literal control over the server. The only thing stopping them from having the Admin/Owner crown is self control.</p>
<p>Second, you also aren’t showing that you have any promising… anything for this server of yours.<br>
What makes me want to spend any longer than I already have (writing this reply) on your server?<br>
What makes it worth it to take hours upon hours of my life to write code for some random person I’ve never met?</p>
<p>Third, Not to mention, you’re probably paying the programmer part of the donations, if you’re even paying them.<br>
RSPS is <span class="bbcode-b">not supposed to be about money</span>, but if you want a full time developer, you’re gonna have to pay them. That’s just how business works. Or, you can be your own developer so you don’t have to pay a third party.</p>
<p>Finally, this isn’t the correct section for getting a programmer.</p>
