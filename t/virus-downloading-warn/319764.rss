    <title>Virus Downloading Warn</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/virus-downloading-warn/319764</link>
    <description>Hello people,

I&#39;m going to show you how to download Virus Scanner and what to get thinking about on Server Files you are downloading from people, so yes.. I&#39;m really caring for you&#39;s and I&#39;m the one who is looking out for you not to download a Virus, I&#39;ve had a talk / discussion about topics having complaints and Viruses on. I&#39;m really, really getting Viruses nearly every day, after I&#39;ve downloaded the Virus Scanner, I&#39;ve never had a Virus from the Virus Scanner, it really works and protects you from getting Trojans, Viruses, Worms.

All you who are reading this, you are supposed to be paying attention, I am not letting this happen, Trojans, Viruses, Worms are very dangerous and could destroy your computer settings and files.

We are getting complaints on server files, downloaded from this Download Section. Please, when you downloaded a Source / Client, always edit &quot;RUN&quot; and make sure it has this or somthing simular in:-

[code]
@echo off
title (Your Choice)
cls
cd ../build
color c
echo Server is online :)
java -Xmx512m net/com/espeon/Server 43594
pause
[/code]

You will always have to check the RUN.bat first, otherwise you could be getting a shock. Batch Files are dangerous, they are trickful and Illegal, running a batch file could lead to a dangerous ending for your computer or hardware. You will NOT like to buy another computer...

Thank-you for reading, please remember this section and I will add more.</description>

              <p>Sorry but I see this as more of a tutorial than a download. People firstly don’t need a guide on how to download something, and secondly most computers already come with a Virus scanner.</p>
