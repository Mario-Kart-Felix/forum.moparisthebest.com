    <title>Quiz + rules</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quiz-rules/170778</link>
    <description>Okay, I&#39;ve been noticing a LOT of MoparScape spam lately. I prepose that the quiz says somthing to the effect of 
&quot;What is word 5 of rule 5?&quot; and a couple others. Then after the quiz is taken, the rules come up and you have to type &quot;I agree to the rules of moparisthebest.com&quot; to complete the quiz. This way we would stop the MoparScapers from saying &quot;plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz helllllllllllpppppppppppppp meh cod a surrver!!!!&quot; in the &quot;questions&quot; section and other sections that get spammed a lot. What do you think?</description>

              <p>[quote=“ThugLife, post:42, topic:170778”]Lets just accept the community the way it is, it is obviously staying a runescape cheating community so therefore it is going to still attract the wrong sort of people. If there was ever an essay put in place (which obviously won’t be, just saying) i know for a fact you would not have probably more than 2 - 3 essays a day because this community, honestly has nothing more to offer than other communitys do. Why would someone waste their time writing an essay when they can go join another community that offers pretty much the same without a fuss.</p>
<p>Yes, this community was unique a while ago but as time as gone on more people have made communitys and runescape cheating is pretty much dead.[/quote]</p>
<p>There is no ‘wrong type of people’ thuglife. There are those who are young and who have been brought up since a very young child to be dependent completely on others. That is all we are seeing here. These are people (referring mostly to moparscape) who do not wish to help themselves but expect everyone around them to spoonfeed them. This is why they are lazy and incompetent people who will flame you just because you say you do not want to help them.</p>
<p>And yes, Jagex killed runescape cheating on January 2nd, we need not a community anymore yet we still have rsps (/317) and a discussion forum. Wow, how the tables have turned…</p>

              <p>Lets just accept the community the way it is, it is obviously staying a runescape cheating community so therefore it is going to still attract the wrong sort of people. If there was ever an essay put in place (which obviously won’t be, just saying) i know for a fact you would not have probably more than 2 - 3 essays a day because this community, honestly has nothing more to offer than other communitys do. Why would someone waste their time writing an essay when they can go join another community that offers pretty much the same without a fuss.</p>
<p>Yes, this community was unique a while ago but as time as gone on more people have made communitys and runescape cheating is pretty much dead.</p>

              <p>Meh, just a thought. I know it’s a totally different site. But What is this site about now? Just a general overview. I can see Scar, some coding, and an Other section, but other than that it’s just a discussion forum. Which is great, because I’ve never seen a community last so long on just discussion.</p>
<p>You may be right about open registrations, but what if you didn’t make registrations done only by refferal, but did incorporate an Essay system. Then introduce some more modding/hacking/coding forums, and kind of pull a one eighty for the direction of the forum.</p>
<p>A darker theme is a plus for me. I’ve used the default one since I registered, which I don’t have really any problem with. But I was saying that to become some sort of Game Appreciation, or Modding site, a darker theme would be more appropriate.</p>
<p>Money, who cares. I assume it does help you pay for some of the upgrades you do on your truck though right? Lol. But what about in-text ads on MoparScape, I think that would be an awesome source of revenue for you. You could use that to maybe pay for a website template, forum template, etc. And have sort of a theme throughout the site. So it flows.</p>
<p>Back to talking about registrations. I can’t say they are useless, you’re right. But having an Essay would filter out the bad. And attract some of the new. It still has that exclusivity factor. Not to mention we get some good members.</p>
<p>I know most of what I suggested really shouldn’t be important to me. But most everyone else is not necessarily worried, but curious about the future of the community.</p>

<p>I think the essay idea is great. But I think for that to be incorporated into the register system, there should also be a referral system, where you must be referred here from a member of the site to be able to join.

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So where are you going to find the people who are willing to read 300+ essays every single day?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I was thinking something like an automated grader. But having a Refferal System in place, people would have to know each other, or be able to contact a member of the site to join. So it slows down the flow of Registrants to a smaller amount. Rather than 1,000 a day, it might be like 50 or 60 a day. Leaving people who might want to read Essays would. And by incorporating the Essays, less people would want to register, so further lowering the registrations per day to maybe 10 or 11.</p>
<p>Now in saying that, I know Mopar will refuse, he has like 1,000,000 members already, he’s on his way to the top. But the useless registrations get annoying. I think that by either making registration more complicated, or having more requirements to join might reduce the amount of registrations, and really only allow the intelligent ones here. Which also introduces a new factor, Exclusivity.</p>
<p>Excluding the general populous from joining, makes the want to join even higher. So I’m thinking, make the community private, remove most of the useless members, Drop MoparScape, or make it unaffiliated with Moparisthebest altogether. And  introduce Warez back into the forums, and make the site into a Gaming Appreciation Site. Add a premium member or some sort of Special Rank that you have to pay for. And that’ll be more cash for Mopar. Change the Forum skin to something dark and black, and make this place real popular amongst the rest of the hacking/cheating/modding world.</p>
<p>In doing so you’re exposing the site to a whole new world of information. Having groups of people from every kind of background imaginable. Not to mention Mopar could quit college and live on the money he’d be getting from the site.</p>
<p>Now I’m beginning to get off subject, so I’m done discussing this. If anyone agrees with me, or thinks it’s a good idea. Message me.[/quote]</p>
<p>What you are talking about is an entirely new site.  This site has always had open registrations and I plan to keep it that way.  Why should you have to know someone to register? That is how communities die, with no new members comes stagnation and then the community simply withers away.  ‘Useless registrations’ as you call them don’t really affect you, they hurt no one and every now and then we get another valuable additon to the community.</p>
<p>If you want a darker theme, well I could easily do that, suggest it with a poll and see how many people respond.</p>
<p>As far as the money goes, I have never been in this for the money.  If I were, I would already have ‘donator’ awards like every other RS-cheating site (and most forums) I have ever been on.  Donations just breed corruption and that becomes the communities downfall.</p>
