    <title>Players cant log back in? help please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/players-cant-log-back-in-help-please/107681</link>
    <description>Everytime a character logs out in my server, its filled with null, and it shows that that is a player, even though it isnt. Could anyone help me with that glitch? Also, sometimes they cant log back in, which is a major problem.

Also, if you want to check it out on my server to see it,

ip: pksc4p3.no-ip.org
ip2: firesc4p3.no-ip.biz
port: 5555

so go to file, new port, enter 5555 and hit ok for the noobies.</description>
