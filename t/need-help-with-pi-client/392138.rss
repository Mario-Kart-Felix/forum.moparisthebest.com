    <description>hey i just need help with setting up a pi server and client i already downloaded a source and client but when i ran server its good but client when i run it turns black with the red loader saying error connecting to server report problem and i though maybe it was that client so i downloaded another client and samething so im guessing to make pi clients work i gotta do something special? if someone could please help me i would greatly appreciate it 

notes to consider.
i didint set up a no - ip yet or portforwarded or anything this is new computer i just got jdk and stuff but i should still be able to connect to server on port 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1 
also i tried to do what most people would say move the cache to c drive done that and stuff but i still cant get it to work. I think i am doing that part wrong though :/
