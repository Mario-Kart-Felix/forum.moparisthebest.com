    <title>I am looking for 508 command that shows the bank of another player</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-am-looking-for-508-command-that-shows-the-bank-of-another-player/349702</link>
    <description>i am currently looking for a command such as ::showbank (username), or ::viewbank (username)

this is a simple and efficient fix to stop dupers and people who have staff items or donator items.

so far i have this as my command


if(command.startsWith(&quot;showbank&quot;) &amp;&amp; command.length() &gt;  9 &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt; 1) {
        String otherP = command.substring(0, 7);
        Client c = null;
        for(Player p : Server.PlayerManager.players) {
                if(((Client) p).playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(otherP))
                        c = (Client) p;
        }
        if(c == null)
                return;
        for(int i = 0; i &lt; playerBankSize; i++) {
                tempBank[i] = bankItems[i];
                tempBankN[i] = bankItemsN[i];
        }
        for(int i = 0; i &lt; playerBankSize; i++) {
                bankItems[i] = c.bankItems[i];
                bankItemsN[i] = c.bankItemsN[i];
        }
        openUpBank();
}</description>

Its a bit more complex since your looking at it through code format, but still. Also you can log on to their account u kno?
