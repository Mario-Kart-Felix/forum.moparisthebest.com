    <title>Looking to gather staff for project RS sever</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-to-gather-staff-for-project-rs-sever/543104</link>
    <description>Okay, I have a goal to launch a successful Runescape private server. I have launched a few in the past years on my own, however, I just never had the time for them. I&#39;m currently finished with school and between classes and work I actually have a lot of free time on my hands, so I want to try this one last time. This time I want to do it right though.

 I want to put together a devoted team to help each play a vital role in creating a popular server. I want a committed team.
  So for the people who interested, here&#39;s what I&#39;m looking for: I need a few coders, graphic designers (Website, Video making, and art), moderators, and administrators. Looking for people with some experience and commitment. I don&#39;t know what type of server to make nor a version, so that&#39;s something I would like to discuss after I gather people.
  Any questions, feel free to ask.
