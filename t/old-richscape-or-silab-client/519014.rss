    <title>Old RichScape or Silab Client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/old-richscape-or-silab-client/519014</link>
    <description>Hiya everyone.
I&#39;m in need of the client for RichScape.
It&#39;s a fairly old rsps. If you don&#39;t have the v4 client, but could link me to any version of the client, I&#39;d VERY highly appreciate it.

Also, as far as I know SilabSoft has shut down.

Are there any SilabSoft clients that aren&#39;t just a .jar and actually work? I&#39;ve been looking everywhere for a silabsoft source and a compatible client.

Thanks a bunch!</description>
