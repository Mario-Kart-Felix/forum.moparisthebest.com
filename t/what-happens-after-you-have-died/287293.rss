    <title>What happens after you have died</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-happens-after-you-have-died/287293</link>
    <description>What do you guys think happens after you&#39;re dead? Do you reborn into a different creature, like a fly or something else :)
Do you become a ghost and can float everywhere around without people seeing you. 
Do you go to a place like heaven/hell?
And etc..
Btw, I&#39;m not talking about what happens to your body, i&#39;m talking about what happens to your soul, so no &quot;You get burried and burned&quot;.
Also, please don&#39;t spam the thread with useless comments like: &quot;You respawn a lumbridge&quot; blah blah blah. People who post such stuff think they&#39;re funny but they aren&#39;t.
Discuss. :)</description>

Well I guess your mind process doesn’t start until you are concieved. You don’t think as there was nothing for you to think with. Thus proving that before life may in fact be similar to death without a mindstate. But then I had the though of death being a non-existent high…<br>
Anyways… I still believe in heaven/hell. My mom went to a psychic or whatever those people who contact the dead are called. They nailed every trait of my grandma, even down to the smoking in the bowling alley.</p>
