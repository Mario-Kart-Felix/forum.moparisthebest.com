    <title>Almost done, I need your help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/almost-done-i-need-your-help/104181</link>
    <description>Okay, I found my default gateway and my Ip address, I followed a tutorial at Portforward.com. Now, I got to this point in the tutorial but I did not understand one bit what it was talking about, it just had 1 sentence and it practically said fill it in. 

I don&#39;t know what to put in the boxes. I have a linksys router if that&#39;s helpful in any way.
