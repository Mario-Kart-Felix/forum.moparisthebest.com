              <p>umm shophandler for the shops and the item ids are in there lol idk</p>
<p>for making objects</p>
<p>Purpose: Making Global Objects</p>
<p>Difficulty: 3</p>
<p>Assumed Knowledge: you should know how to add voids</p>
<p>Server Base: cheeazscape 78</p>
<p>Classes Modified: client.java</p>
<p>UPDATED : after reports of the objects being glitchy i have removed the first void and replaced with 1 that should stop the glitching i suggest you add this instead</p>
<p>ok so i made this tut for a freind who passed it on to someone else and he believes people would want this tut so here it is :-</p>
<p>due to alot of people askign for it, i have decided to re-release</p>
<p>all 90% by me<br>
creds to lawl for the void</p>
<p>procedure<br>
step 1</p>
<p>ok first of look for this in your client.java (PS YOU DONT NEED TO LOOK FOR THIS JUST ADD THE NEXT BIT WITH YOUR OTHER VOIDS -.- )</p>
<p>Code:<br>
/* OBJECTS MAIN */<br>
if you dont have it add this<br>
//lawls void</p>
<p>Code:<br>
public void makeGlobalObject(int x, int y, int typeID, int orientation, int tileObjectType){ //Makes Global objects<br>
for (Player p : server.playerHandler.players){<br>
if(p != null){<br>
client person = (client)p;<br>
if((person.playerName != null || person.playerName != “null”)){<br>
if(person.distanceToPoint(x, y) &lt;= 60){<br>
person.createNewTileObject(x, y, typeID, orientation, tileObjectType);<br>
}<br>
}<br>
}<br>
}<br>
}<br>
or this one</p>
<p>Code:<br>
public void AddGlobalObject(int x, int y, int typeID, int orientation, int tileObjectType)<br>
{<br>
outStream.createFrame(85);<br>
outStream.writeByteC(y - (mapRegionY * 8));<br>
outStream.writeByteC(x - (mapRegionX * 8));</p>
<p>outStream.createFrame(151);<br>
<a href="//outStream.writeByteA" rel="nofollow noopener">//outStream.writeByteA</a>(((x&amp;7) &lt;&lt; 4) + (y&amp;7));<br>
outStream.writeByteA(0);<br>
outStream.writeWordBigEndian(typeID);<br>
outStream.writeByteS((tileObjectType&lt;&lt;2) +(orientation&amp;3));<br>
}</p>
<p>Code:<br>
public void ReplaceObject2(int objectX, int objectY, int NewObjectID, int Face, int ObjectType) {<br>
outStream.createFrame(85);<br>
outStream.writeByteC(objectY - (mapRegionY * 8));<br>
outStream.writeByteC(objectX - (mapRegionX * 8));</p>
<pre><code>	outStream.createFrame(101);
	outStream.writeByteC((ObjectType&lt;&lt;2) + (Face&amp;3));
	outStream.writeByte(0);

	if (NewObjectID != -1) {
		outStream.createFrame(151);
		outStream.writeByteS(0);
		outStream.writeWordBigEndian(NewObjectID);
		outStream.writeByteS((ObjectType&lt;&lt;2) + (Face&amp;3));
		//FACE: 0= WEST | -1 = NORTH | -2 = EAST | -3 = SOUTH
		//ObjectType: 0-3 wall objects, 4-8 wall decoration, 9: diag. walls, 10-11 world objects, 12-21: roofs, 22: floor decoration
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>step 2<br>
now add this void under the code you just added</p>
<p>Code:<br>
public void NewObjects() {<br>
makeGlobalObject(3004, 3383, 2469, 0, 10);//portal<br>
}<br>
this is an example of a portal in falador park</p>
<p>step 3<br>
next search for case 121: and inside that case add this…</p>
<p>Code:<br>
NewObjects();<br>
(note adding it here will reduce lag signifigantly…)</p>
<p>now to get this to work add more<br>
Code:<br>
AddGlobalObject(3004, 3383, 2469, 0, 10);//portalto the<br>
Code:<br>
public void NewObjects() {<br>
now<br>
Code:<br>
makeGlobalObject(3004, 3383, 2469, 0, 10);//portal<br>
ok the<br>
Code:<br>
makeGlobalObjecttells the server you wish to make an object<br>
this part<br>
Code:<br>
(3004, 3383, 2469, 0, 10);is the most important</p>
<p>ok the first 2 numbers “3004, 3383” are the x and y coords of the place you want the object<br>
then the “2469” is the object ID in this case a portal<br>
the “0” is the objects facing direction<br>
and then the “10” is for a ground object keep this the same !!</p>
<p>for object facing you can change the number so that it face’s a different way and these are the numbers below:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
0= WEST | -1 = NORTH | -2 = EAST | -3 = SOUTH<br>
step 4<br>
you may also need to add this if you get errors saying you dont have</p>
<p>Code:<br>
public void ReplaceObject2(int objectX, int objectY, int NewObjectID, int Face, int ObjectType) {<br>
outStream.createFrame(85);<br>
outStream.writeByteC(objectY - (mapRegionY * 8));<br>
outStream.writeByteC(objectX - (mapRegionX * 8));</p>
<pre><code>	outStream.createFrame(101);
	outStream.writeByteC((ObjectType&lt;&lt;2) + (Face&amp;3));
	outStream.writeByte(0);

	if (NewObjectID != -1) {
		outStream.createFrame(151);
		outStream.writeByteS(0);
		outStream.writeWordBigEndian(NewObjectID);
		outStream.writeByteS((ObjectType&lt;&lt;2) + (Face&amp;3));
		//FACE: 0= WEST | -1 = NORTH | -2 = EAST | -3 = SOUTH
		//ObjectType: 0-3 wall objects, 4-8 wall decoration, 9: diag. walls, 10-11 world objects, 12-21: roofs, 22: floor decoration
	}
}

              <p>to make npcs drop stuff go to the drops.cfg and use that syntax to make the npc drops, make npcs have health by changing the 0, in npc.cfg to the amount of health you want. to make the person start out in a certain area or respawn, change the respawns in client.java and change the starting coords in player.java</p>
<p>making construction work takes hours upon hours to fix</p>
<p>to make objects give xp go to the object case, and then add the void to add xp there</p>
<p>max level for skills would be found in player.java/playerhandler.java/client.java, i forgot <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
you get ancients with the pimpscape source<br>
you spawn objects with -fedexer-'s tut on global objects which has been removed due to gay vets and admins<br>
you make the portals work by adding a freakin case for them<br>
if you dont know how to make shops, you shouldnt code, it has about 5 steps or so that are fairly easy<br>
get a good id number for your last question</p>
<p>EDIT: to make shops you need to add the 2 wanne shops in client.java, add the autospawn of the npc, add the shop in  shop.cfg, add the items in the shop, also in shop.cfg, enjoy</p>
