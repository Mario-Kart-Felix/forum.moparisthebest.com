    <title>Basic Winsock Send and Receive Data(CHAT) in Visual Basic</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/basic-winsock-send-and-receive-data-chat-in-visual-basic/1776</link>
    <description>Ok I think I will start as a moparisthebest member by Writing a tutorial for a Simple VB chat in MSWINSOCK.

Ok Simple winsock programming is easy it can be used for a wide range of Stuff such as file transfer, Sending and receiving text, IRC functions and Much more But today lets only Talk abot Send and Receiving Chat.

Ok Lets just Start with the Main Form. VB coders know what to do But for all the ewbs here you go. Start up VB and Select Standard EXE. 

Click Project&gt;&gt;Components&gt;&gt;Microsoft Winsock Control 6.0(SP5) So that the checkbox is checked. Now click Apply then Close.

You Sould see a Small Control on the tool Pane looking liks

Figure 1.0

Drag it onto the Form and name with wsckChat.

Now you need some Other Components here they are in a List


[ul][li]1x Listbox Called lstRcvd[/li]
[li]3x Text boxes called txtIP, txtPort, txtMsg[/li]
[li]3x Command Buttons called cmdConnect, cmdListen, cmdSend[/li][/ul]


Now you can work on a GUI see Mine Below.

[img]http://sxcdesigns.com/tutimg/chtGUI.JPG[/img]

Now that the GUI is complete I will Give you some Code so Double click cmdConnect and Add the Following Code.

[code]Private Sub cmdConnect_Click()
wsckChat.Connect txtIP.Text, txtPort.Text
End Sub[/code]

This tells the Winsock Control to Connect to An IP then the Port The port Must be between 1024 and 9000

Now if You want to act a s a server Remember only Fill out txtPort. Now to add code to cmdListen Double click it and add the Following.

[code]Private Sub cmdListen_Click()
wsckChat.LocalPort = txtPort.Text
wsckChat.Listen
End Sub[/code]

wsckChat.LocalPort will tell the winsock Control that its to use the port in the Textbox wsckChat.listen will tell it to listen on the Lcal Port.

Now if we wanna know that it conected ok then we Add the following Cde. Double Click the winsock Control and add the following.

[code]Private Sub wsckChat_Connect()
MsgBox &quot;Connected Successfuly you may begin Chatting Now!&quot;, vbInformation, &quot;Pyrox Winsock Chat Tutorial&quot;
End Sub

Private Sub wsckChat_Error(ByVal Number As Integer, Description As String, ByVal Scode As Long, ByVal Source As String, ByVal HelpFile As String, ByVal HelpContext As Long, CancelDisplay As Boolean)
MsgBox &quot;Error &quot; &amp; Number &amp; &quot; &quot; &amp; Description, vbCritical, &quot;Pyrox Winsock Chat Tutorial&quot;
End Sub[/code]

The error will display if it could not connect. The Connect will display the Connected Successfully Message.

Now we have that Ne need to add another Peice of Code This will tell the Winsock Control to Parse the Code and Do the Right Thing.

[code]Private Sub wsckChat_ConnectionRequest(ByVal requestID As Long)
wsckChat.Close
wsckChat.Accept requestID
End Sub


Private Sub wsckChat_DataArrival(ByVal bytesTotal As Long)
Dim data As String
wsckChat.GetData data
lstRcvd.AddItem wsckChat.RemoteHostIP &amp; &quot; : &quot; &amp; data
End Sub[/code]

The connectionRequest is for the server only If you are the server you will need to accept a connection to do this winsock muct close then accept the Request ID.

The second part is Data arival. It will store the data in a string and add it to the List Box.

To complete this Application we need something to send dont we. So double Cick cmdSend and add the following.

[code]Private Sub cmdSend_Click()
Dim send As String
send = txtMsg.Text
wsckChat.SendData send
lstRcvd.AddItem txtMsg.text
End Sub[/code]

This will store the Message in a string and send that String to the Remote Connection.

Here is an example of it working
