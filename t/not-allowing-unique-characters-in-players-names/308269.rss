    <title>Not allowing unique characters in players names</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/not-allowing-unique-characters-in-players-names/308269</link>
    <description>Ok, so I am able to add it so when a player tries to create a username with a unique symbol (such as ~ ) it disconnects them and does not save their character file.

I added
&lt;blockquote&gt;if ( players[i].playerName.contains(&quot;~&quot;) ) { //Test Foo
			players[i].disconnected = true;
			players[i].savefile = false;
		}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 to PlayerHandler.java under the public void process {} part.

It works fine, but the only problem is when they get disconnected, they try to reconnect right away.  Which in turn gets them disconnected again.  In other words they are stuck in the &quot;Lost connection.  Attempting to Reestablish&quot; screen.

How do I stop them from automatically reconnecting?  I have been messing around with it for a while now and can&#39;t figure it out...</description>

              <p>Instead of doing that, how about you add a piece of code in the run() method so that their name is checked while login is occurring?</p>
<p>In your client.java, find your run() method and go to the point where it checks to see if the username is banned.<br>
Add the following code (modified if necessary) beneath it:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (!playerName.matches("[a-zA-Z0-9_ ]+")) {
    disconnected = true;
    returnCode = 4; //it will tell the user that they have been banned; change this if required
}</code></pre>
<p>This code will block any names that contain characters that are not alphanumeric in nature. In other words, it will only allow names that contain the letters A-Z and a-z, the numbers 0-9, whitespaces and underscores.</p>

              <p>A good possible idea might be an ipfilter. I know alot of servers do it. But for you server it might not be a bad idea. Another idea. Something i used to do. If their named contained foul language or a character i would have the server show them an interface not supported by their client. They either from or disconnected. Skipped right past the loading screen. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
