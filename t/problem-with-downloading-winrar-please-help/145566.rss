    <title>Problem with downloading WinRar, please help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-downloading-winrar-please-help/145566</link>
    <description>I have had winrar for a while now, and i stopped using it for about 1 month or 2, and now that silabsoft&#39;s new client is out, i really want to play on it.  but whenever i download it, my WinRar tells me that after 40 days of using winrar, i have to buy the winrar license???  So i cant play on the new client and i cannot buy winrar because i dont have a credit card, or i dont want to spend 40 frikken bucks.  PLEASE someone help me, i really want to play on silabsoft&#39;s sick new client like everyone else.


thanks a bunch</description>
