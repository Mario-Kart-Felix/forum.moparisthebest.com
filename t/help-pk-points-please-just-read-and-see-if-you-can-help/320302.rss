    <title>Help, PK POINTS! Please just read and see if you can help!</title>

    <description>Hello everybody, thanks for taking the time to read this.
Now my problem is with PkPoints (as the topic says). I would like to know how to add them?
People are requesting I add them. I&#39;m on a PwnScape base (Delta) and I really need some help.

And also if anyone could help me with making a shop for PKpoints (i&#39;d put statius, vesta and etc.) that&#39;d be cool.

Thanks, Fox0wnage.</description>

              <p>first add this<br>
public int PkPoints;</p>
<p>anywhere in client.java, the do control+f and search killerz</p>
<p>then add this after the last killerz.something</p>
<p>killerz.PkPoints += 2; 2 is how many pk points are added.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE:<br>
if (!IsInFightCave() &amp;&amp; !isInPitGame() &amp;&amp; !isInPitRoom() &amp;&amp; playerRights != 2 &amp;&amp; playerRights != 3 &amp;&amp; playerRights != 4 &amp;&amp; action != 1 &amp;&amp; deathStage == 2 &amp;&amp;  System.currentTimeMillis() - deathTimer &gt;= 1500) {<br>
client killerz = (client) server.playerHandler.players[KillerId];<br>
youdied();<br>
killerz.sM(“You have defeated “+playerName+”.”);<br>
killerz.pkPoints += 2;<br>
updateRequired = true;<br>
followingh = false;<br>
appearanceUpdateRequired = true;<br>
}</p>
<p>i’m still working on pkpoints shop…its pissing me off…im still a newbie coder</p>
