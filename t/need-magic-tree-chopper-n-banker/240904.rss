    <title>Need magic tree chopper n banker</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-magic-tree-chopper-n-banker/240904</link>
    <description>Hi I have noticed that most of the good tree choppers are outdated these days. Apparently scar scripters are waiting for some sort of SMART update or something. When this happens, I would really appreciate some one developing a good woodcutter macro that actually cuts magic trees and banks them. If yews are easier, one that banks them in Edgville would also be nice. Thx</description>
