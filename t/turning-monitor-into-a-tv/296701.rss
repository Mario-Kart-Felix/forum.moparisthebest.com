    <title>Turning monitor into a tv</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/turning-monitor-into-a-tv/296701</link>
    <description>[s]Im going to buy a new monitor soon from dell and I wanted to know something I see alot of monitors with 5ms response times and this one has a 2ms response time. I want to know if I will noticed any difference. I am using this for my bedroom computer so I wont be doing any gaming mostly internet. I am going to buy a cable box so I can use the HDMI input to watch TV but I want to know. Is 2ms response time bad or good?[/s]

Well this is the monitor I went with this one

http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&amp;cs=6008&amp;l=en&amp;s=eep&amp;sku=320-7976&amp;~tab=SpecsTab

Now that ive got it ive been thinking of ways to turn it into a tv. I have a 20 inch dell monitor that has a yellow input (forgot what it is called) I use to hook up a vcr to watch tv and it supports PIP which is awesome I mean a monitor with PIP I havent seen those in forever. But now I got this one and it has a HDMI input. I was thinking I should just get a cable box from charter (my cable provider they suck) but I dont want to spend that kind of money so ive been exploring alternatives. I came upon this article
http://www.cnet.com/computer-monitor-to-tv/
But I would really like to use the HDMI capabilities instead of VGA even though it has a vga pass through and the box is pretty impressive PIP tv ghosting in background etc but I really want to use it for HD so if anybody knows of any kind of box that would add these kind of capabilities that would be great.</description>

              <p>New question</p>
<p>BTW anybody suggestion tv tuner…first it is a laptop second I have a HDTV stick which I dont want to use… so all options will have to be uncomputer related</p>
<p>Also all lcd monitors I can find are tft really and my 3 current wons are the same even dells high models use tft so I dont see the problem. also it came with a 3 year warranty and the dells ive previoulsy had before I started building my own computers have always been good on their warrantys after a couple years one of my samsung 250gb harddrives went out and they replaced it no questions asked with a 320gb WD + they had someone come out and put it in lol which wasnt really necessary but they wanted to pickup the old one so whatever.</p>
