    <description>i decided to start anew on shops in my server so i deleted all of the shops in shops.cfg and i got rid of all the wanneshop things i then added in  a shop to shops.cfg and i put this in for wanneshop

} else if (NPCID == 2790) {
                PutNPCCoords = true;
                WanneShop = 1;

this, according to every tut ive read about making shops should make a shop but instead. when i click talk to npc it gives me a fish!!!!</description>
