    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-davidscape-portals-in-spawn-and-motd/551151</link>
    <description>Hey! On my server I have som portals in my spawn, which I don&#39;t want. And I have some messages (appears in a box similar to a quest/skillguide box) on my screen when I log in. I also need to need to make my motd different. Can anyone help me with these things? I have watched and read tutorials but haven&#39;t found anything that works with my server (my server files is different from theirs). I have skype if anyone wants to help me there</description>

<p>Why not just use grep, or findstr?</p>

<p>Are you using Windows 7? Windows 7 can search java files with no problems. I can search for “1234” and it’d pull up files that had the string “1234567890”.<br>
Another way to do the search is to get the Z-FileSearcher.jar. It does basically the same thing, though I’m not a fan of the UI.<br>
A third option is to load up the project in an IDE and use the IDE’s file search. This is something I would highly recommend.</p>

              <p>Have you tried using windows file search to just search the plain text and then editing/removing it?</p>
<p>As for the portals: get their object ids. Then search them using the file search. Delete the code that looks like it’s related to spawning them.</p>
<p>Note: I don’t use a 508 source nor DavidScape.</p>
