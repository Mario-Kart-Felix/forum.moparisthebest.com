    <title>Dupe method in all source&#39;s how to fix</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dupe-method-in-all-sources-how-to-fix/256432</link>
    <description>Ok so iv fixed over 8 different dupe method&#39;s up to now in deltascape source, but I just been made aware of enougher one, where by when you trade and go to 2nd trade screen, the player disconnect&#39;s his internet leaving the 2nd trade screen up, then the other player accepts.

I was thinking something to check if the player is still connected or not, but as its a xlogg kind of idea Im pretty sure the server will still think there online till it times out.

Any methods of fixing this glitch would be great.</description>
