[10:56:57 PM] Yambar: Guru (Devanagari गुरु) is a Sanskrit term for &quot;teacher&quot; or &quot;master&quot;, especially in Indian religions. The Hindu guru-shishya tradition is the oral tradition or religious doctrine transmitted from teacher to student. In the United States, the meaning of &quot;guru&quot; has been used to cover anyone who acquires followers, especially by exploiting their naiveté, due to the inflationary use of the term in new religious movements.[1]
