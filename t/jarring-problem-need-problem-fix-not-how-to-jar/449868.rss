    <title>Jarring Problem (Need Problem Fix, Not How To Jar.)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jarring-problem-need-problem-fix-not-how-to-jar/449868</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to make a webclient for my rsps, so I&#39;m attempting to JAR the webclient ready file that came with the source. (Hybrid PVP V3 Webclient Ready File)
So far, I&#39;ve managed to do everything right but it&#39;s making a .bat file and a basic file, not a single .jar when I make it. How do I get the JARMaker to make me a.jar rather than generating the .bat and the other file? HELP ME ASAP!



Sorry, I&#39;m retarded I had .bat checked. Permission to bitch slap me granted.</description>
