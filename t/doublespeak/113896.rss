    <description>Fans of Orwell rejoice! 


-- &quot;Acts of war are heralded as &#39;humanitarian interventions&#39; (to restore) democracy.

-- Military occupation and (killing civilians are called) &#39;peacekeeping operations.&#39;

-- The derogation of civilities (through totalitarian &#39;anti-terror&#39; legislation) is called providing &#39;domestic security&#39; and upholding civil liberties.

-- ....expenditures on health and education (and most other essential social services) are curtailed to finance the military-industrial complex and police state.&quot;

-- &quot;US protectorates are installed with the blessing of the &#39;international community.&#39;

And who can forget [b]Operation Iraqi Freedom?[/b], which is/was a great euphemism for Operation Kill Iraqi&#39;s? Liberate=Conquer...etc. 1984 just twenty years too soon.

Oh, I also thought this was interesting:

Permanent Bases in Iraq
In May 2005, the Pentagon announced that the current 106 US bases in Iraq will be consolidated into 4 huge bases: &quot;The new, sturdier buildings will give the bases a more permanent character, the officers acknowledged. But they said the consolidation plan was not meant to establish a permanent U.S. military presence in Iraq.... Each base is being designed to hold a brigade-size combat team plus aviation units and other support personnel. Initially referred to in planning documents as &quot;enduring bases,&quot; the term was changed in February to &quot;contingency operating bases.&quot;
