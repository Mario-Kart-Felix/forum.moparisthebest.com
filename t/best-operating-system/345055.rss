<p>Windows 7. it is very fast for the amount of features &amp; complexity it has, it also has the highest compatibility out of any operating system.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Linux, at least with KDE, has far more features that Windows 7, it also had that much advertised ‘snap’ feature before Windows 7 came out.  Also, what do you mean by ‘compatibility’?  Windows 7 obviously has more compatibility with windows programs, but Linux has more compatibility with Linux programs etc etc.  So even with software compatibility, windows has no way to run linux programs, but on linux you can use WINE to run some windows programs.</p>
<p>If you are talking about hardware compatibility, then you are just plain wrong.  Windows only runs on x86 or amd64 architectures, Linux runs on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_supported_architectures" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">vast majority of architectures</a> and devices that range from personal computers, netbooks, smart phones and ‘dumb’ phones, servers, super computers, cars, toasters, microwaves, satellite boxes, cable boxes, and VOIP phones like skype.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>different type of compatibility.</p>
<p>lets say 100,000 programs are out there.</p>
<p>i would say 99.9% of them were made for windows, and even then that 0.1 can still run on windows. Sure linux can run some of them with 3rd party programs and even then with glitches etc, it’s just not the same.</p>
<p>I have tried Linux and i know MITB your a big Linux fanboy, but really how can you say windows is not the best OS overall. a computer is nothing without a wide range of things to do. Windows achieves that simply because it has the market share, and since developers like to get their apps sold, almost everything is made for windows.</p>
<p>Same goes with hardware really, in Windows you can plug and play non legacy hardware and there’s a good chance it would run straight off the bat. If it does not, you can get drivers from the manufacturer to do that. Theres a very small chance these driver packages will be set up for anything other than windows.</p>
<p>With linux you need to spend hours tracking down the right drivers to get all your gear working, and even then your bound to come across problems. With windows it is much simpler, that’s just how it is.</p>
<p>we can put on a huge windows vs linux debate if you wanna go that far, im sure linux suits your needs and all, i know it sucks that windows cost money and M$ are cunts, but windows simply is the best OS.<br>
[/quote]Really, you just need to give other operating systems a chance, I used to be a Windows fanboy but then I switched to Linux. At first I was like “Umm, this is bullshit.” then I messed around with the settings, installed some programs that increased compatibility, and I fucking loved it. And I’ve gotta say that the fact that it rarely crashed was a huge plus up. Later on I got a Mac and it’s just about the same except with better graphical interfaces.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>if i was just a programmer sure id use linux, but i’m a heavy gamer. that cuts my choices down to windows. plus i’m quite a master in windows after all these years, i like being able to  find my way around in seconds, and not have to use effort figuring out how to do stuff in linux.</p>
<p>i’m a man who likes tasks completed in as little time, and as easy as possible, which is why i’m Windows only.<br>
[/quote]Yea, but when you get a virus, or your programs crash you have to start over and/or lose time.<br>
Both ways you’ll lose time in the long run.[/quote]</p>
<p>nah, IMO advanced windows user will always have the fastest route.</p>

<p>lets say 100,000 programs are out there.</p>
<p>i would say 99.9% of them were made for windows, and even then that 0.1 can still run on windows. Sure linux can run some of them with 3rd party programs and even then with glitches etc, it’s just not the same.</p>
<p>I have tried Linux and i know MITB your a big Linux fanboy, but really how can you say windows is not the best OS overall. a computer is nothing without a wide range of things to do.

<p>Same goes with hardware really, in Windows you can plug and play non legacy hardware and there’s a good chance it would run straight off the bat. If it does not, you can get drivers from the manufacturer to do that. Theres a very small chance these driver packages will be set up for anything other than windows.</p>
<p>With linux you need to spend hours tracking down the right drivers to get all your gear working, and even then your bound to come across problems. With windows it is much simpler, that’s just how it is.</p>
<p>we can put on a huge windows vs linux debate if you wanna go that far, im sure linux suits your needs and all, i know it sucks that windows cost money and M$ are cunts, but windows simply is the best OS.<br>

At first I was like “Umm, this is bullshit.” then I messed around with the settings, installed some programs that increased compatibility, and I fucking loved it.

<p>if i was just a programmer sure id use linux, but i’m a heavy gamer. that cuts my choices down to windows. plus i’m quite a master in windows after all these years, i like being able to  find my way around in seconds, and not have to use effort figuring out how to do stuff in linux.</p>
<p>i’m a man who likes tasks completed in as little time, and as easy as possible, which is why i’m Windows only.[/quote]Yea, but when you get a virus, or your programs crash you have to start over and/or lose time.<br>
Both ways you’ll lose time in the long run.</p>

<p>Linux - Stable, open source, big community that helps, easy to learn and use, etc.<br>
Windows - so what stable, very compatible, easy to learn, etc.<br>
MAC - stable?, compatible, very good graphical stuff and other nice entertainment stuff, etc.</p>
<p>We should be choosing the best out of each OP, because it would be impossible to pick the best because you have to also add in how much it is used, cost, what other features are added in like service packets (Updates), etc.</p>
