    <title>Black ops Unlock all glitch</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/black-ops-unlock-all-glitch/378812</link>
    <description>Theres a glitch where you can have any gun/camo/(pro)perks at any level.
I dont know if it will be around for much longer but its pretty useful if you just prestige and want 74u or commando or something.

*This is kind of poorly written but oh well, and if you need help with anything just post or pm.

Anyways, heres what you do:

- You need 2 people, the person that wants the gold guns and stuff has to get an invite from their friend, TO A THEATER LOBBY.
- Your friend then switches very fast between theater and player lobbies
- You should get a black loading screen after a while, when you do, tell your friend
- Your friend has to quickly switch back or stop at theater lobby
- You should then get an error message of some sort, press (A) and then (B)
- You should be at the main menu, go to local, system link, create a class, go to the first class and go to camo&#39;s and hover over gold 
  camo (but dont click on it)
- Once you are at gold camo, tell your friend to back out of his theater lobby
- You should then get another error message, press (A) and you should be at a player match
- SWITCH LOBBIES to a private match and you can now create classes with ANY camo, perk, gun.
- once your done just switch lobbies to a player match again or back out, it doesnt really matter.

THINGS TO TAKE NOTE OF:
- Make sure you create the classes you need in the private match, because once you back out you will not have all the camo&#39;s and things unlocked, only what you had before
- You get the pro perks by going to the perk you want and pressing (X) to enable pro perks.</description>
