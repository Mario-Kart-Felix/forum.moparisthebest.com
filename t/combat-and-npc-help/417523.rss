    <description>I posted a previous topic about NPC chat and I figured that out, but now im having more problems with my NPCs.

First of all Whenever I attack an NPC I dont hit anything. I am always hitting zero&#39;s.
Second of all my NPCs dont move. Even when I put coordinates in they dont move to them.

If any one can help that would be awesome. I can upload pics, my server anything you need to help me.

P.S. I have searched for this on google and using the search bar and havent found anything on this problem.</description>
