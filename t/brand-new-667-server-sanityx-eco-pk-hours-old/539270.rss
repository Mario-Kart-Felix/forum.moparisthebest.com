    <description>Hey guys, im currently playing on this great 667 server called Sanity-X. The owner is really nice and cares about the community and growth of the server. We are currently only 1 day old and are looking for dedicated players. I have a link to the youtube video that was put up, but it doesn&#39;t show much. So please come log on and see for yourself.

STAFF IS NEEDED BADLY!
