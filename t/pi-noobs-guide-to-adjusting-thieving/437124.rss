Hey guys, It&#39;s Alister. This is my first post to this forum and I&#39;m new soo.. yeah (:
So we&#39;re going to be fixing the Ardougne thieving stalls today, and I&#39;m going to be teaching you how to do it. So you can start by opening up your Source file and searching &quot;actionhandler.java&quot; After you open it, then you search (CTRL + F) &quot;thieving&quot; and something like this should pop up:
[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/Alister777/actionh.png[/img]

So now I&#39;m going to explain what this stuff means:
[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/Alister777/explaining.png[/img]

Case 4874: &quot;4874&quot; is the Stall ID which the person will be stealing from. Feel free to modify to your likings.
1897: &quot;1897&quot; is the Item ID which the person will be stealing. Feel free to modify
10: &quot;10&quot; Is the amount of EXP the person will gain from stealing from the stall. Feel free to modify
1: &quot;1&quot; is the level required to actually steal from the stall. Feel free to modify
 So we&#39;re going to be fixing/making these stalls (in order):
Gem stall
Fur stall (You have to stand behind it to thieve from it)
Spice stall (You have to stand behind it it thieve from it)
Silk stall
Baker&#39;s stall (You have to stand behind it to thieve from it)
Silver stall

Now click below one of the top ones, and paste these codes into there :)

[code]			case 2562:
				c.getThieving().stealFromStall(1611, 120, 80);
			break;
			case 2563:
				c.getThieving().stealFromStall(948, 100, 75);
			break;
			case 2564:
				c.getThieving().stealFromStall(2169, 90, 70);
			break;
			case 2560:
				c.getThieving().stealFromStall(950, 90, 70);
			break;
			case 2561:
				c.getThieving().stealFromStall(7542, 145, 85);
			break;
			case 2565:
				c.getThieving().stealFromStall(1806, 185, 99);
			break;[/code]
If it looks a little out of place, adjust it by using TAB and Enter keys.

So now it should look a little like this:
[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/Alister777/final.png[/img]

So that&#39;s about it! Like I said, some of them, you have to either stand directly in front or back. [size=24pt]NOTICE: I found this on my computer from a while back on another forum. I guess I meant to post it but forgot. Anyway, If I f*cked something up, lemme know please x)[/size]</description>

You should rewrite it to improve.</p>
