    <description>For now, I don&#39;t have the resources to give to a forum.  Especially one that didn&#39;t have any real purpose, or members that were interested in it&#39;s wanted purpose.

I&#39;m sorry guys, but when I get time, I&#39;ll work on it again; but as of right now, Mopar is my home again.</description>

Fuck that shit, lmao.  I don't ever recall conversing with Xerxes for anything other than SCAR, and that was ages before Aryan was out.  Also, you can't prove that either, I was not the one to post them.  Also, I don't even know where I'd get the scripts.  I don't fucking care about Aryan.

Fuck that shit too.  I was well on my way to creating a working script.  And, I didn't make shit using SBoT.

<p>Xerxes, do you recall leaking Aryan scripts with me?</p>

              <p>[quote=“Pwnd, post:15, topic:5911”][quote=ruler]<br>
You on the other hand have done X100 more:<br>
distrubting leaking my sbot3 scripts.<br>
then helping admin a site that sold my scripts at a reduced cost (<a href="http://tonsofscripts.com" rel="nofollow noopener">tonsofscripts.com</a>)<br>
Then finally you see the light and actually purschase the scripts then you tried to charge back.<br>
leaking aryan scripts<br>
sending them in pms<br>
then you create <a href="http://pwndproductions.com" rel="nofollow noopener">pwndproductions.com</a> and bam their is my bot (UBI), never removed…[/quote]<br>
Distributing of SBoT pay scripts was deamed illegal by RichyT before your ass showed up.  He said that you were the only person, excluding Edward, that was capable of providing decent scripts for the new SBoT.  This was true, but since SBoT had the same script engine as Aryan, they were merely shitty ports.</p>
<p>I never administrated <a href="http://TonsOfScripts.com" rel="nofollow noopener">TonsOfScripts.com</a>.  I only knew it existed when the owner asked me for scripts.  I kindly gave them to him because of the demoralization of our community you caused.</p>
<p>I purchased them to find out they were shit.  I’m not even fucking kidding you, and you know that I didn’t get anything from them.  My php signature would tell you that.  So, anxiously, I tried getting my money back by filing a dispute.  You obviously didn’t take kindly to this and didn’t understand how truely shitty your scripts were.</p>
<p>I never leaked your Aryan scripts.  Why would I?  I never even used Aryan.  So, what would be the purpose of me getting scripts?</p>
<p>I never removed UBI from my site because I didn’t care.  I used it as an advertising scheme.  43 or so members joined that day.  I was happy.  And you know that I wouldn’t remove it?  I have a grudge against you.  Deal with it.[/quote]</p>
<p>demoralization of the sbot3 community?, LOL, i was begged to script for the bot buy 5 users in fact they helped pay for my auth.</p>
<p>You purchsed them a month after you leaked them.  You purchased them to get updated versions, you knew what you were getting.<br>
They were the only scripts that last more than 30minutes.  They lasted longer than other script because i wrote my own walking methods, i didn’t use richyt’s.</p>
<p>You charged me back after sbot3 died, not after gettings the scripts.</p>
<p>As for sbot3 scripts being similar to aryan, you obviously never scripted for both.  If it was so easy then why didn’t ANYONE convert any aryan script to sbot3.   A sbot3 script were on average twice as long as a aryan because it had to have tons of checks e.g. which tab is selected, IS THE OBJECT ON SCREEN.  This made scripting very difficult when compared to aryan.  Aryan let us interact with things that were not visable, thus script was easy as cake.<br>
SBOT3 had a mouse manager that prevented actions like this.</p>
<p>You did work hand in hand with Xerxes on kaitkieks to leak aryan scripts.</p>
<p>I have never done anything to hurt you.  Without me sbot3 would have never have been proftable.</p>

Distributing of SBoT pay scripts was deamed illegal by RichyT before your ass showed up.  He said that you were the only person, excluding Edward, that was capable of providing decent scripts for the new SBoT.  This was true, but since SBoT had the same script engine as Aryan, they were merely shitty ports.
<p>I never administrated <a href="http://TonsOfScripts.com" rel="nofollow noopener">TonsOfScripts.com</a>.  I only knew it existed when the owner asked me for scripts.  I kindly gave them to him because of the demoralization of our community you caused.</p>
<p>I purchased them to find out they were shit.  I’m not even fucking kidding you, and you know that I didn’t get anything from them.  My php signature would tell you that.  So, anxiously, I tried getting my money back by filing a dispute.  You obviously didn’t take kindly to this and didn’t understand how truely shitty your scripts were.</p>
<p>I never leaked your Aryan scripts.  Why would I?  I never even used Aryan.  So, what would be the purpose of me getting scripts?</p>
<p>I never removed UBI from my site because I didn’t care.  I used it as an advertising scheme.  43 or so members joined that day.  I was happy.  And you know that I wouldn’t remove it?  I have a grudge against you.  Deal with it.</p>

actually 2 staff members,  srl stuff was removed by starblaster.  Aryan stuff wasn’t removed and I approved to be released, i wanted to see the code.  Nerice wasn’t going to let me see it privatly, to him it was public or no one.  Nothing ever came of both leaks.  The offical aryan devs realsed the refactor, which is the only valuble part publicy pre-emently.  The aryan dev stuff was released due to a verbal fight between regex and nerice nothing else.</p>

<p>I don’t know what mopar said about me, but it would not surpise me.  For one he never removed my aryan scripts.  Star was not allowed do it bc mopar requested him not to.  Mopar dosn’t respect me.  He didn’t remove my bot till he was forced by a ddos from nerice.  Not to mention the ddos that i recieved from newbiehacker which hit first. Also mopar promised me that he would ban the cracker but didn’t bc the cracker was on his staff.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>your not going to drag this old garbage up again are you? :rolleyes:</p>
<p>I never said anything about you or genodemon except that I didnt really agree with you selling aryan, and that I thought you guys were stupid for all that ddosing bullsh*t you started/kept going.</p>
<p>I removed all your leaked items that were posted here in the beginning, that is until impsoft started leaking other people’s work (the aryan dev team’s new private bot) and then I said what comes around goes around, and stopped removing your stuff (btw, I never asked starblaster not to remove anything, in fact it was never discussed bewtween us)</p>
<p>I didnt remove any bots after nerice ddosed me, your timeline is screwed up <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>And most importantly, you and genodemon are still not banned from this community, your both even community members, even though I caught you once ddosing me, and another time redirecting via .htaccess ddos attacks aimed at your site to here, when I have done nothing but help you, you should be thankful you werent banned a long time ago…[/quote]<br>
I guess star mis-understood.  He dosn’t have a history of directly lieing to me.</p>
<p>Their were script posting dating back to Feburary which is way before any leak or even a bot from me and they existed till it closed.  Not to mention every pack.</p>
<p>Newbie hacker and mixx silbasoft both cracked the bot and posted it on your forums, i informed you. You quickly removed it and fell asleep.  Once you fell asleep they re-posted.  That is when newbiehacker started ddosing me and I redirected and nerice ddosed you also. Your host quit after 3min. It 2-day suspended your site.  They made programs and distributed them on this forum and in irc.  I made the mistake of selling a bot with the source included, i tried to honor regex’s opensource but afterward turned to obfusication like dcthugs.</p>
<p>That time when i was about to reidrect the ddos here was a ddos from <a href="http://Sythe.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Sythe.org</a> and cheeters site.  The ddos stopped when my reflect overloaded his own sql.  I was angry at the time because your forums member were calling me a ripper, nerice a ripper and you didn’t enforce your rules.  Nerice started calling them rippers and you delted his posts.  double standard.  which is fine, you make the rules.  But i didn’t do it.  still my bad thou.</p>
<p>Their was the time when your forum acct got hacked on ym forum and only my forum and started posting things…<br>
Their was also the time all my posts on here got pruned which happned the day before the event above.</p>
<p>What happened, happened nothing can change that.</p>
