    <title>Need Help with an RSC Client!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-an-rsc-client/279108</link>
    <description>For those who didn&#39;t know RSC is runscape classic :P

Ok, i have just downloaded MoonSpell_Server, i downloaded it, it has a client of its own inside of the source :P . So now i need how to change the ip address from moonspell client to connect to my server.
Any help?  :confused:

Inside the server files there are folders like 508 servers, :P. here are the folder names, bin, doc, ext, lib, res, and src, no this is not similar to 508 servers but there is IO in src lol, but there is some file, not in src (mabye) called mudclient.java. saw everything in it, nothing :P

HERES SOME IMAGES OF THE SERVER (my future server :P)
