    <title>Flawless Scape 498 PK &amp; Economy</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/flawless-scape-498-pk-economy/553235</link>
    <description>FlawlessScape is a 498 server based on Arios, as the developer of Arios did a really good job with the server. After spending 3 months coding Runesource from scratch, I found the Arios release. There are just really small changes as I will be updating the server when its running. We currently use the PK world of Arios. If we gain enough players for full economy world, we have enough space to host both servers. All non-combat skills are set to 1 and if you want you can skill like in an economy server. Later we will add some areas and items that require high non-combat skills. There are also reward shops for PVP, and bosses at which you can obtain similar items.


Goals:
We want to create a full 498 emulation but with custom content such as instant PK, custom minigames, and more. We also want to add Ironman mode; Ironman mode will have some features disabled such as item spawning, and manual skill level adjusting. Also we want to entice players to enter the wilderness as much as possible, so things like bosses and whatnot are being added to the wilderness/wilderness areas. A website will be up soon where players can suggest new content, and it will be held to a community vote.

For the website we are using our own CMS that is developed for RSPS. In our website there is an integrated phpbb forum with login and registration system. We also implemented full Client(server) registration. We limited account creation to 3 so you can only have 3 accounts with your UUID. UUID is generated for your PC automatically. You can easily manage all your accounts through the website itself. Also forum and shoutbox have synchronized ranks from in-game and we want to create a really advanced website. We are also working on our own Webshop system where you can buy perks and credits.
