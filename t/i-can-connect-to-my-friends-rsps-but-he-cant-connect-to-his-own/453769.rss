    <title>I can connect to my friends RSPS, but he can&#39;t connect to his own?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-can-connect-to-my-friends-rsps-but-he-cant-connect-to-his-own/453769</link>
    <description>Okay, so I searched around the internet for about a hour trying to help him fix it but we can&#39;t find anything.

I&#39;m able to connect to his RSPS, which means he&#39;s portforwarded correctly. This is a PI 317. 

He just can&#39;t connect to his own one? Any ideas?</description>

              <p>hmm… if there is somewhere to change the ip on rswebclients have him try connecting to 127.0.0.1 since he is hosting it or if he is using utorrent it maybe be a problem by blocking him from connecting</p>

It’s a webclient. We don’t use the client files…<br>

are you both joining a public, or is it one that one of you host to play with each other?[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m the main owner. I just gave him the files so that he could host it when I’m offline. I’ve gone through all of the ways to get it online so it works fine. Just not for him.</p>
<p>I think it’s public. We have about 5 players online on a average.</p>

<p>I’m able to connect to his RSPS, which means he’s portforwarded correctly. This is a PI 317.</p>
<p>He just can’t connect to his own one? Any ideas?</p>
