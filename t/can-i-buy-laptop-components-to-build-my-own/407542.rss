    <title>Can I buy laptop components to build my own?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-i-buy-laptop-components-to-build-my-own/407542</link>
    <description>I&#39;m making a wifi/internet controlled robot for fun and as I have no experience with low level electronics, it would be a lot easier if I could just run linux on a laptop and control shit via the parallel port. I could also easily attach a USB webcam, a microphone and a speaker.

If I could buy laptop components individually this would allow me more size flexibility and not require the pointless screen. I could also have just one battery for everything, rather than an additional battery for the other shit the robot does.

Anywhere I can buy them from that deliver to the UK? Alternative suggestions to achieve what I&#39;m doing?</description>

              <p>Have you ever thought about an older cheap android phone?  It already has USB, wifi, a camera, speakers, and a microphone, and you can write programs for it.  You wouldn’t need it to be activated, so you could probably pick up a Droid 1 or similar with a bad ESN (can’t be activated) for $20 or less on ebay or craigslist.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Mopman, post:2, topic:407542”]It would probably be easier and potentially more fun to use either a PIC or one of those new fangled system on a chips like the *duinos. It’s not really that much more low level than what you’re already describing, it’s just not x86.</p>
<p>If you insist on x86 though, why laptop components and not something like PicoITX?[/quote]Wouldn’t it be difficult to set up wifi and webcam on a PIC?</p>
<p>The PicoITX does look appropriate, but I don’t really understand how I’m supposed to use it. Is it just like a standard motherboard (but tiny and stripped down) that I can just add a wifi card and hd to? Also, they seem to be around £200 but I could just get a netbook with wifi etc for less. That was just from a quick google search though.</p>
