<p>If you want a good community, actual competent programmers to make content for you to play, and overall a great server check these guys out. For those of you who know me I tend to report stuff in a large bulk. Within a week these guys had most of my bugs repaired.</p>

<p>Wrong, what I was saying was that this is 2015. And unless you’re making a nostalgic based server then features you are flaunting are worthless. Your server is a very high revision server so it shouldn’t even be considered a feature. I am aware bank pins and dicing are somewhat relevant, but they are NOT features. Not in a server like yours. Again it’s 2015, your server is a modern server.</p>
<p>And promo codes + referral systems are not hard to implement. Infact I had it on my server… And it was a Czar…</p>

<p>Please let me know if you can’t see the layout as there is some media in the layout.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>by layout are you talking about those bullet holes on your first picture? If so I can hardly see the actual image as it is behind a text. There needs to be ALOT more media.[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s your opinion.<br>
Personally I feel too much media just makes a thread look ugly. You should provide a minimal amount so that people come online to see the rest.</p>
<p>I will however add a few more pictures.</p>

              <p>Poorly made thread. There needs to be more media than just some pictures regarding your exclusive code (which is also wrong as in your pictures the code is runeserver yet it is actually moparscape).</p>
<p>read your thread before posting it.</p>
