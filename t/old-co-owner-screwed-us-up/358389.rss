    <title>Old Co-Owner screwed us up</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/old-co-owner-screwed-us-up/358389</link>
    <description>We recently cut a co-owner out of our server, and he somehow ruined our webclient so that no one can connect to it.

we cut him out while he was asleep; changed every password, and had the VPS restarted.

i dont know what happened, and i think we have tried just about everything.

he says that he &quot;buttf**ked&quot; our webclient, but the download client doesnt work either.

if anyone can help me out, that would be great.

<p>Just tell everyone to delete the cache from where its loaded from on their computer than have the webclient redownload the cache and see if that works</p>
