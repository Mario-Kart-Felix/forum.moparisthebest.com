    <title>Red Faction Guerilla</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/red-faction-guerilla/275323</link>
    <description>Ok downloaded the demo today and this is basically how it pans out:
Grumbles and Gripes:
its not first person, this sucks mainly because its not as good as the originals in this aspect, however the view is nice and the controls are just right i feel.
No endless mining, now anyone who played Red Faction will know that the destructible environments were positively epic, my favourite map was the one where there were two facing bunkers, you could sit there with a rocket launcher and mine an endless tunnel into the rock face for as long as you wanted it was amazing and endless fun for multiplayer. This isn&#39;t here in this one, the rock is solid however the objects within the environment blow up nicely with scrap and shrapnel everywhere very nice.
This timed bullshit, im hoping this is just because its a demo but if its not i will be most displeased at this, what kinda wigga shit is this? its awful and should be scrapped.
Positives:
Controls for a TPS are nicy and easy to get to grips with, the game is beautiful everything explodes brilliantly and you can see every detail of it. Driving is brilliant the interactivity with the buildings is great if not a little over the top, for example i ploughed straight on through a metal wall which was fun but unrealistic. The physics are superb everything flows nicely and bits and bobs flying all over the gaff is great. The combat is nice, the weapons are pretty good and the bots are fairly intelligent for bots its quite nice to play through the first mission on hard because the bots act realisticly its very cool.
Bottom line:
i loved every minute of it, i loved placing charges along the bridge and then blowing the oncoming AI into a valley, i loved throwing explosives every which way and blowing the whole lot up in rapid succession. However this all being said it is not as good as the orginal red faction which was positivily superb, its multiplayer maps with hidden weapons that you had to get to by building your own staircase out of wall by blowing holes in it and the endless glee of destroying the entire map just to find you missed a bit and more destruction was needed, hopefully the multiplayer in this will step up to the plate and deliver an excellent online experience. I am definatly buying this game for my PS3</description>
