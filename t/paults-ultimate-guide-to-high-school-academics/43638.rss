<p>I’m Australian. It’s a shame that the UK and America can’t just be cool like Australia. -.- You should all have pre-school, followed by kindergarten (which takes place in/at a primary schoo), then years 1 - 6 at primary school, and then 7 - 12 at high school. After that you can either do TAFE or Uni. The world would be a better place if everyone did it like that I think. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>

              <p>For the most part, I enjoy school. Some things really suck, but that isn’t unlike other things in life anyway. It’s not like everybody is going to have a 100% happy run through life - There will always be those few things you dislike in anything you do for one reason or another.<br>
In Australia, it’s quite different - If you drop out of school before doing the HSC these days, you’re likely to struggle a bit… People drop out after Year 10 in favour of doing an apprenticeship instead of years 11 and 12. Of course, they have to compete with students who have completed 11 and 12 (Their HSC) when going for the apprenticeship - Who do you think wins? Just like Ron said, some things are always favored over others, and at the end of the day it’s the paper that counts.</p>

lol try getting into a good college with a “<span class="bbcode-b">G</span>ood <span class="bbcode-b">E</span>nough <span class="bbcode-b">D</span>egree”. Unless you are extremely intelligent, you have a very very very low possibility of going to Harvard, Duke, Brown, Yale, or any of the other Ivy league colleges.</p>
<p>You can get into a cozy community college though, and hopefully you can find a job after that… hopefully. Otherwise you’re fucked.</p>
<p>So sorry man, but it’s not the same. If like most, you don’t plan to go to college, then ya go for the GED, but also remember the GED isn’t exactly… easy test to pass. In fact, by many, it’s considered hard. Here is some information on it. <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?What-to-Expect-on-the-GED-Test---Improving-Your-Score&amp;id=134731" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Link</a></p>

Going to an Ivy league college only looks good on paper, nothing really different.<br>
Believe me, my brother has graduated from Harvard, and his girlfriend is at another Ivy league college(can’t remember the name) studying law, and they say that it makes no difference in the quality of what they teach you, but it just looks better on paper when you apply to a job.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah I know. And that’s the only thing that counts when you get out of college. What you have on file and on record of what college you went to. If you went to some out of the blue college that no one ever heard of and you were up against 2 people who graduated from Yale, then you’re probably not going to get the job.</p>
<p>And I’m sure there is a difference in education, teachers, etc. If you didn’t know, Ivy League schools are really hard to get employment with as a professor. Compare trying to get a job there versus some joe blow college, it’s much easier, and therefor the teachers could also very easily suck in those schools, making it hard to get your degree and education.</p>
<p>More classier and smarter teachers and also normally more diversified (unlike Duke) in those great colleges.</p>
