              <p>I’m postive that when you open your shop.cfg in your source folder there should be your shop id, and a bunch of numbers after that.  The first two numbers should either be a one or a two, unless it is 995 which is the currency the shop runs on.  Back to the number 1 and 2, ‘one’ means the shop only sells what it has in stock and you can only sell what’s on stock.  And ‘two’ means you can sell whatever.</p>
<p>I remember reading this a while ago, but not sure if I got the wording right.</p>
<p>Oh and by the way to make it unsellable after changing the variable to “1” just remove the item from the shop by searching the item id and removing it and the price.  Make sure you are in the same row as the shop id.</p>
