I am very noobish with this stuff, I played mopar for years on the web client and just played on servers but now everything needs clients. So heres my problem when ever i try to log into a server like Stabbing scape or chris-scape, It always says error connecting to server, I know the servers arn&#39;t down because this has been going on for a couple of days and people say in there posts that there playing it.
