<p>Obviously your family doesn’t know how to take care of cars.  My 1989 S10 blew it’s motor in 2007 with 312,000 miles on it, I put a new motor in it and it’s still driving strong.  My other American vehicles have 132,000 156,000 123,000 etc etc with no problems in sight.  Take care of your American car and it will take care of you, routine maintenance is all you need to do.</p>

<p>Ha don’t even talk to me like you know shit about my family. My father took the vehicles in for maintenance AT THE FUCKING BUICK DEALER every time they put the sticker on the window and said come in for oil change at this mileage, AND he took it in for all of the maintenance for every mileage milestone in the manual, and the vehicle still shit out on us even after paying half the cars value in repairs. If that isn’t a fucking testament to how shitty American cars are then nothing is. I don’t even have to argue it because its been a proven fact by so many private research companies. My 2005 Acura MDX has 180,000 miles on it and the only thing that has ever been done on it was regular oil change, transmission fluid change, and the other milestone maintenance, and a VSA sensor that went out. ALL OF THAT doesn’t even total $5000 and thats pretty fucking unbeatable for taking it to the Honda dealer for all maintenance. Bottom line is a majority of american cars are shit, and a majority of japs/german imports are reliable. I guess thats why GM dropped the shittest of them all Pontiac and Saturn. Thank God they are more American car brands being dropped, now I don’t have to stare at as much new ugly pieces of shit on the way to school each day.<br>

<p>This is why I perform all maintenance on my cars myself, sure you took it in and paid them, but you don’t know if they did it at all or did it right.  They also could have used a cheap filter that failed.  I have one mechanic I trust that I drive 35 miles one way all the way to Indiana to when I can’t/don’t want to do a repair.  Before I met him I did it all myself.[/quote]</p>
<p>My father is really anal about this kind of stuff. He makes sure they only put new oem filters and parts into the vehicle, and we buy our own syntetic oil and transmission fluid and he usually makes the manager let him set in the shop while they are performing mainteance. Anything they replace he asks for the old parts to make sure they aren’t fucking with him. You may ask why he goes through all this trouble when he could do it himself for free? Honda guarentees all their work and if something fucks up and it has to do something with what they were working on they will replace it for free, and they also inspect other aspects of the vehicle to make sure a part isn’t going bad for free. If that isn’t a plus then I don’t know what is.</p>

<p>You guys still fail to tell me WHY a specific car is shit.</p>
<p>My 2007 mazda6 runs on a mercury motor, and a fusion chassis. It doesn’t matter what percentage of shares they owned. You can’t get away from the fact they still use Ford parts. The Mazda2 and Fiesta are on the same platform, also for the Focus and Mazda3. So what where you saying about new Mazda?</p>

<p>Shows how much you guys know about cars. Same thing goes for Mazda, they run on a lot of Ford parts. Aren’t they on top of that most reliable list? You can’t bag on American cars, chances are you’re driving one. Koenigsegg used a Ford block to power it’s super cars. They say it’s their own block now, but it’s a bunch of bullshit. I still see Ford parts all over that engine. Ferrari bought the magnetic ride control off GM, which is currently being used in the 599 GTB, and the ZR1.</p>

If it wasn’t for that bump I would never have seen that picture.  I believe that’s a Ford Pinto, horrible car, and definitely not a mopar.</p>
<p>Mopar is Dodge, Plymouth, Chrysler, and Jeep.<br>

<p>I think I typed “Shitty American Car” into google or something and that was the first result. I know which brands fall under mopar.[/quote]</p>
