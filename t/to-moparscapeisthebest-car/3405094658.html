<p>I’m an American dipshit. My family has owned many American cars including Buick, Cadillac, and Ford. They were all shit and they all had huge problems such as transmission problems, ac unit going out, etc, and all this was before even 100,000 miles.<br>

<p>Obviously your family doesn’t know how to take care of cars.  My 1989 S10 blew it’s motor in 2007 with 312,000 miles on it, I put a new motor in it and it’s still driving strong.  My other American vehicles have 132,000 156,000 123,000 etc etc with no problems in sight.  Take care of your American car and it will take care of you, routine maintenance is all you need to do.[/quote]</p>

<p>Ha don’t even talk to me like you know shit about my family. My father took the vehicles in for maintenance AT THE FUCKING BUICK DEALER every time they put the sticker on the window and said come in for oil change at this mileage, AND he took it in for all of the maintenance for every mileage milestone in the manual, and the vehicle still shit out on us even after paying half the cars value in repairs. If that isn’t a fucking testament to how shitty American cars are then nothing is. I don’t even have to argue it because its been a proven fact by so many private research companies. My 2005 Acura MDX has 180,000 miles on it and the only thing that has ever been done on it was regular oil change, transmission fluid change, and the other milestone maintenance, and a VSA sensor that went out. ALL OF THAT doesn’t even total $5000 and thats pretty fucking unbeatable for taking it to the Honda dealer for all maintenance. Bottom line is a majority of american cars are shit, and a majority of japs/german imports are reliable. I guess thats why GM dropped the shittest of them all Pontiac and Saturn. Thank God they are more American car brands being dropped, now I don’t have to stare at as much new ugly pieces of shit on the way to school each day.</p>

<p>Ha don’t even talk to me like you know shit about my family. My father took the vehicles in for maintenance AT THE FUCKING BUICK DEALER every time they put the sticker on the window and said come in for oil change at this mileage, AND he took it in for all of the maintenance for every mileage milestone in the manual, and the vehicle still shit out on us even after paying half the cars value in repairs. If that isn’t a fucking testament to how shitty American cars are then nothing is. I don’t even have to argue it because its been a proven fact by so many private research companies. My 2005 Acura MDX has 180,000 miles on it and the only thing that has ever been done on it was regular oil change, transmission fluid change, and the other milestone maintenance, and a VSA sensor that went out. ALL OF THAT doesn’t even total $5000 and thats pretty fucking unbeatable for taking it to the Honda dealer for all maintenance. Bottom line is a majority of american cars are shit, and a majority of japs/german imports are reliable. I guess thats why GM dropped the shittest of them all Pontiac and Saturn. Thank God they are more American car brands being dropped, now I don’t have to stare at as much new ugly pieces of shit on the way to school each day.[/quote]</p>
<p>This is why I perform all maintenance on my cars myself, sure you took it in and paid them, but you don’t know if they did it at all or did it right.  They also could have used a cheap filter that failed.  I have one mechanic I trust that I drive 35 miles one way all the way to Indiana to when I can’t/don’t want to do a repair.  Before I met him I did it all myself.</p>

<p>Because Ford still has low reliability ratings, and Mazda’s reliability ratings are getting closer to the top up with honda and toyota. There is much more to a car than just an engine and a chasis. Engines are probably the easiest thing to take care of, given the proper care they are bound to last you the long time.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You make me laugh. Some of Mazda’s cars are built in Ford factories. Like mine for example, it’s built in the same factory as the RWD mustang. Why do you think a Ford diagnostic tool is compatible with Mazdas? Have you even driven an American car for a long period of time? I had an 01 Impala with 120,000 miles on it, and had an engine bay fire. Guess what, that little V6 kept on going without a problem. You need to learn more about a car then just what Jeremy tells you off TopGear. All I see is a poser right now, come back later when you learn something.</p>

<p>I’m an American dipshit. My family has owned many American cars including Buick, Cadillac, and Ford. They were all shit and they all had huge problems such as transmission problems, ac unit going out, etc, and all this was before even 100,000 miles.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Obviously your family doesn’t know how to take care of cars.  My 1989 S10 blew it’s motor in 2007 with 312,000 miles on it, I put a new motor in it and it’s still driving strong.  My other American vehicles have 132,000 156,000 123,000 etc etc with no problems in sight.  Take care of your American car and it will take care of you, routine maintenance is all you need to do.</p>

<p>My father is really anal about this kind of stuff. He makes sure they only put new oem filters and parts into the vehicle, and we buy our own syntetic oil and transmission fluid and he usually makes the manager let him set in the shop while they are performing mainteance. Anything they replace he asks for the old parts to make sure they aren’t fucking with him. You may ask why he goes through all this trouble when he could do it himself for free? Honda guarentees all their work and if something fucks up and it has to do something with what they were working on they will replace it for free, and they also inspect other aspects of the vehicle to make sure a part isn’t going bad for free. If that isn’t a plus then I don’t know what is.</p>
