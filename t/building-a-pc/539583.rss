    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/building-a-pc/539583</link>
    <description>Hello!
I&#39;m in need of a new pc , my current one is becoming too old to use and , so what i need is just an average computer not too strong or weak. My savings are exactly 340$ , can&#39;t afford more. So what build would you guys suggest for an average pc. 

Thanks!</description>

              <p>The 6300 is comparable to the power of an i5, so why the hell would you buy an i3. Even at the $200 price mark you could get an i5 or you could get an 8350. Depending on what you’re doing, either is a good option. 8350 for rendering any day</p>

What? I don’t really see what you’re saying. If he chooses AMD for a tiny discount then he needs a different mobo, locking him in to AMD. If he decides later on he wants to upgrade to a better Intel CPU he’d have to buy a new mobo… Unless you have good reason to believe the AMD CPU is <span class="bbcode-b">better</span> than the Intel CPU and OP is not likely to want to upgrade to Intel in the future, then you shouldn’t be choosing AMD. Not for the sake of a few $$.</p>

No he can get a decent i5 within budget and still be able to get the things he needs.

              <p>Hello!<br>
I’m in need of a new pc , my current one is becoming too old to use and , so what i need is just an average computer not too strong or weak. My savings are exactly 340$ , can’t afford more. So what build would you guys suggest for an average pc.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
