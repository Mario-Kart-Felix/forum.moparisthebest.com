    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;DESPITE the serious nature of their offences, psychopathic criminals get let out of prison sooner than others - in Canada, at least.

Psychopaths tend to be unusually adept at manipulating others, and even the legal system, to their advantage. &quot;In prison, they push administrators to gain better food, resources, or to work outside on road crews,&quot; says Kent Kiehl of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.

To find out how effective psychopaths are at duping parole boards, Steve Porter of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, studied records of 310 male inmates from a Canadian prison. He found that those termed psychopaths, based on a standard psychological test, were up to 2.5 times as likely as other prisoners to get out of jail early. They were also &quot;much more likely to then violate their parole than non-psychopaths&quot;, he says.

Bob Hare of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, who created the psychological tests, says parole boards may need help to tackle the problem. &quot;Many prison officials have told me that they need better training about what a psychopath is,&quot; he says.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>I generally don’t think of it in manipulative terms, but I do something very similar when I meet people. My bigger thing is though, when I’m daydreaming I constantly have “conversations” in my head with people I know. It’s a bit fucked up, but it passes the time and really does help you get inside peoples heads.</p>
<p>I have social phobia and depression (Everyone else said their disorders, I figured I have to throw mine in to be a part of the topic.</p>

<p>And of course there were the countless nights I’ve spent on harder drugs, insane in the brain. Especially alone. Some pretty scary experiences that only make you stronger, but also weaker in a way.</p>
<p>Going offtopic I guess.</p>
<p>Another good way murderers and rapists get released early is when they arrest non-violent drug offenders. Especially in the states where its very over crowded and they need to make more room for pot smokers.</p>

Do you know the difference between disability and disorder? This is classified in the DSM, its a mental disorder, this doesn’t make them retarded they just think differently.</p>
<p>People with serve mental disorders (such as myself) have been put into placements in hospitals. We don’t think like we should, this doesn’t make us any less smart than anyone else. You’re calling anyone depressed a retard, which no is not politically correct. Psychopathic people have no remorse for many things they do (along with alot of other things) This doesn’t make them stupid or a retard it makes them prone to do more harmful things which is why they are locked up in places<br>

 A mental disorder, also called a mental illness or psychiatric disorder, is a behavioral or mental pattern that causes significant distress or impairment of personal functioning. Such features may be persistent, relapsing and remitting, or occur as a single episode. Many disorders have been described, with signs and symptoms that vary widely between specific disorders. Such disorders may be diagnosed by a mental health professional.
 The causes of mental disorders are often unclear. Theories ...</p>
