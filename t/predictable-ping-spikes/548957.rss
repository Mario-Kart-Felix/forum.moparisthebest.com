    <description>I&#39;ve been having absurdly predictable ping spikes and I can&#39;t figure out why

I have some ping tests showing how it seems to be &#39;scheduled&#39;.
On the left is the NA league server, on the right is google.com. Blank lines are dropped packets.

If you want to see a longer log I&#39;d be happy to make one.

Anyway, it seems to happen every 8 or so pings (8 seconds). Without fail. I have absolutely no idea why, there was nothing else on the network and I had no other programs running on my computer (other than what was used to record, but this happens when I&#39;m not recording).

I thought the internet was bad because of the weather (we have like a foot of snow), but it seems far too predictable to be any sort of coincidence. 

Do you guys have any tips? Need any more information? (Router/modem is docsis 3.0, have comcast... also their customer service line is down right now which is A++++)</description>

              <p>Only time weather really should be a factor is if you are using satellite internet. Try rebooting both Modem and Router. Leave them off for 30+ seconds and then turn them back on and see if the problem continues. If it is, call your ISP and find out what is going on.</p>
