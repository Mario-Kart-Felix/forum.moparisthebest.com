    <title>Good Bye, Good Luck and Take Care</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/good-bye-good-luck-and-take-care/4948</link>
    <description>I will leave the scene within a couple of hours. The bloodhounds have been sniffing @ my doors eversince I announced the end, so please keep an eye on things while I am gone, will you.
I felt it necessary to bitch once more @ impsoft since they already &quot;decided&quot; to release all our scripts from our inside srl... forum. grrr.

You where my most talented and most trusted members. Together we archieved what nobody thought possible. Against all odds, we conquered Runescape! I think it is a true wonder that 30 People of all ages and all continents cooperated for such a long period of time, creating such a technical structure, without even knowing each other, and all through ASCII text and a bunch of smilies! And we never even got really mad at each other (even though I lost most of my elites through stupid repos-updates...)

I have made a [b]hotcopy[/b] of the COMPLETE repository (!) for you as a new starting point... (Will pass it to you someway...)  I will keep the SRL-Forums SQL-Database to myself for the time being. It just wont be the same after I am gone. Nobody can replace WT-Fakawi and thats a fact!  
Choose yourselfs a new Leader fast. Mopar would do fine I guess (if he has the time to manage all)...though Dankness and Flyboy are mature enough to handle affairs properly too....

I trust SRL will be a valuable piece of content for your forums. Use it wisely! I will still be popping in once and a while to browse and maybe even react. And keep an eye on villavu.com too. It wont be offline long.....


P.S.: I would really like to keep [b]archeorcheox[/b]. You may rape the other 11 Players....

<p>Fakawi, Thanks for being you!!!  When we first talked about getting SRL going, I had no idea you would take to banner and run with it as far and as fast as you did.  You are a true inspiration to me, an inspiration which I have taken into my professional life.  Through SRL we have managed to do the impossible, and have done it with style!  I hope you stay in touch reguardless of where life takes you.</p>
<p>My hat comes off in respect as I salute you for the effort you have done.  Thanks and may God bless you and your family in all you do.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Flyboy</p>
