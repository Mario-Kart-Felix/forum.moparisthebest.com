    <title>[req] im looking for a base</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-im-looking-for-a-base/302681</link>
    <description>hey so im looking for a base and i would love to use rs2d or hyperion but i cannot seem to really get those to work for me yet i want a server that is basically a framework that is stable. so i looked around and i decided that emulous 1.5 would be the perfect base but then when  i looked into it it was messy and redundant and from the looks delta. [i]so i was wondering if anyone could give me a name or point me in the direction of a base or framework that is an equivalent of emulous 1.5 just less messy and redundant[/i]. now it doesnt have to have all the features or even half of them but i was using it to give you guys a general idea of what im looking for.

              <p>Umm why dont you just use it and edit it like everyone else. Dont think its anymore bases like that one in perticular other then that.</p>
<p>Besides make it look cleaner and decent its already a stable source, it just needs you to fix it up. And it gives you a reason to code so you wont be a nooby leecher. So just use that base or use the search box to find one if it doesnt show up then its not on here lol.</p>
