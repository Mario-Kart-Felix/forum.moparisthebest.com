        <p>Seeking team to RuneScape 2007 - 2008</p>
<p>Good evening, I’m thirty years, I am the developer over twenty years, and have some money to maintain a dedicated VPN server runescape, the 2007 and 2008, I am looking for developers who can and want to collaborate on this project, all the cost of the server will be paid by me, to keep the game online without lag issues and all the worlds that exist in the world from 1 to runescape world 178, is kept on a server of the highest quality.</p>
<p>But employees need to develop, need to find a pre-ready project that is working, not all interactions need is the game running, but some key aspects of the game, if someone has post the link to download the project, or leave the email or facebook link so I can get in touch.</p>
<p>Already expensive for developers who want to help, leave your email or facebook link, we will get in touch.</p>
<p>objective:<br>
Our goal is to be practically the old runescape, which we all loved, from the minimal details, the login screen, choose the world and even the graphics and interactions of the season.<br>
But like everything and for everything, we have to make some modifications simple and efficient, which will make a difference to the game, and the game has all missions functioning and interactions the game, but we also add to the game time and form of public reaction new monsters and bosses and even new missions that earn new items, but it will be over time and depending on the will of the public, but the only sure I can give is that the boss of godwars will be added along with your items.<br>
On the market overall, we see no need to add, leave for a while the players make their negotiations, but over time depending on the request of the players and if they want to be really a need we could add Greand Exencheg, but some things will be indeed updated with the time and the way we saw the players and their reactions.</p>
<p>Already the life of the game and your items will be deacordo with time and events, we will do the same system that the current company Jagex made​​, we will apply the same events and Christmas etc. … the company, and these events give items that are valuable, and many of these items can not be obtained after these dates, in the example cited phat santa hat and other …<br>
The items enventos after phats and santas hats, eg yo-yo, puppet, etc. … 'll leave exchangeable, but can only be obtained in that particular date, and can never be obtained in addition to buying one of the other.</p>
<p>If we see the need by having really miss certain item, we will add a recompença system based on these items, but it will also be evaluated with the public.</p>
<p>About signing and so Free</p>
<p>in the early years of the game will leave them open to the public without payment for all tuition, but after the growth of the game on the community we will charge a fee for symbolic play to continue working, something within $ 2.00 anything above this value.</p>
<p>About developers and change the game:</p>
<p>Yes we will add a team dedicated to development, we believe that the current very firm Jagex is doing, we believe that some items like claws Dragonplate rapier and chaotic, there are items that a lot of potential, but we do them in ways that they are balanced in the game. The chaotic rapier is an item of recompença to players who kill over 1k wilds of players on the field and who complete at least more than 50 games in all mini games, after performing this task once the players can choose one item chaotic, where yes it may be exchangeable among you, and still continued degradable, but will increase the degradation time for 72 hours, and if the player wants to arrange the item after the 72 hours he could do this in bob with 90 smithing paying a representative value concert at 5 million.</p>
<p>All the stats of the items will also be equivalent to the game of the season.</p>
<p>About the new monsters like the new queens, the nex and others, and their items, they may be added in the game over time.</p>
<p>But leave it very clear that the game never adopt the criterion of EOC, much less any criteria to be repulsive by the players, all our updates are deacordo with every suggestion of the players.</p>
<p>On the extreme potions and overloads, but they will be an option in the game.</p>
<p>About pvp worlds, all worlds have the pvp aspect, the wilds, but some may be cited worlds entirely pvp because there is a number of players who love and adopt the criterion of pvp.</p>
<p>About concentações of clans and clan portals, they will be an option to battle the world and will be added at the same location that worked years ago, but warning that the clans could do well in their struggles wilds, but may choose the option to enter the portal and make a controlled fight.</p>
<p>The portals can fight more than one clan if the clan wants to do a battle of more than 6 clans, they can, each with their respective order of players, and can draw a kind of battle, it is all against one, or each man for himself.</p>
<p>Well, I really hope that all fans are eager and able to help in this fight.</p>
<p>The game will be playable by the website, and he will have the support that the company offers Jagex, you own a domain and will work the same way as the current game works with the same technology.</p>
<p>Have a forum, a chat, have the clan chat, have all the tools that are offered by the company.<br>
Besides all have a way to send and receive email to us, the developers, informing technical problems, suggestions and even direct payments and donations doubts, sedo all emails answered within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Each world has a support of 1,500 to 3,000 players players playing simultaneously without crashing with a ping of 100 maximum per player.</p>
<p>The game will release their languages ​​that exist in the world, but the main and initial will be English.</p>
<p>Failure to meet the development team, we will have to hire staff, and the game will not be Free, bond nor a price different from the current runescape, then ask for help for all who have any source of runescape 2006/2007/2008 or 2009 that has mission, and appropriate modifications without robust.<br>
I really hope many people sign up for this project, because we need a lot of help, and our team of 9 people not realizing the project.</p>

        <p>You are planning to have 178 servers? And an exact remake of runescape? Boy, have you ever heard of 2006Scape? That didn’t turned out well.</p>
<p>I’m sure there are people who would love to help, but you really shouldn’t expect people from Moparscape to know how to maintain a database, have a complete understanding of Java and C#, and also know XNA modeling (especially XNA).</p>
<p>I would love to follow the project though (if you even get started).</p>

Your expectations are too high, and it seems that you don’t even have a base to use yet.<br>
Good luck getting players to join a <span class="bbcode-i">private server</span> that you need to pay to play, as there are hundreds more, regardless of how crappy, that are absolutely free.<br>
It also seems that you want to have the developers do all the work while you simply pay for the hosting.<br>
