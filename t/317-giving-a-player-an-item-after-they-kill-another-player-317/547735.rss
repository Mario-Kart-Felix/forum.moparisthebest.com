    <description>Title pretty much says it,

How can I have a certain amount of items given to a player if they kill someone in PvP?</description>

              <p>Uh, where ever you handle the applyDead and giveLife (so where the player dies and then respawns) there will be something that checks if someone killed the player, or if they died via npc or similar…<br>
If they died by another player, it typically makes a new client object for them…<br>
Under where the client object is made, you could add similar to:</p>
<p><code>killer.getItems().addItem(item, amount);
killer.sendMessage("You killed " + c.getPlayerName() + " and got " + ItemAssistant.getForName(item) + ".");</code></p>
<p>Obviously there are things you want to be careful of and probably need to change in that code for it to actually work.</p>
