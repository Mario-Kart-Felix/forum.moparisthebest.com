    <description>Hello, my name is JP, one of the owners of the new RSPS GodsPK. Me and my brother host the server on my brothers computer. I play the server on my computer which is in the othere room. The other night our internet shut down for a strange reason and after a couple of mins it was back up. Before this happened me and my brother could play on our server at the same time with no problems. After the internet shut down the IP had changed and we thus needed to change the Port forwarded IP to get it back up. After we did that our coder changed some IP&#39;s in the files and now the server is back up and running but the only problem is now i can not play our server. My brother has the only computer in my house that can successfully connect to the server, where as before the coding and IP change all of the would work. NEED HELP SOON!!  :mad:</description>
