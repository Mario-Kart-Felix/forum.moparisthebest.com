    <title>2 Click Crash Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2-click-crash-problem/438228</link>
    <description>Well on my oldschool release I just opened I made a fully downloadedable cache and jarred my client (it all came out perfectly) so the client.jar works for everyone but when some people come online they click twice and they crash. This is commonly found in 64-bit and 32-bit processor errors, like when a 64-bit user runs a 32-bit file, but it cant be that becuase it even does it to some of my 32-bit users, but not everyone... I have no fix for this as I have no clue whats going on and i&#39;m losing so many players. Help  :confused:</description>
