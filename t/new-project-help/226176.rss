    <title>New Project Help</title>

    <description>Hi there,
I&#39;m starting a new project called Zodiac, which is in the process of hiring a couple of pro coders.
Your probably thinking, what is Zodiac? Well Zodiac is going to be an empire which has both a Server and Forum, (Forum is for server use only).
Zodiac will contain a team of professional coders, HTML designers and Forum Designers.
If you are interested and would like to have an interview, contact me at hani-rules-07@hotmail.com
Soon i will get our own email system going but until then this is my current email and msn.</description>
