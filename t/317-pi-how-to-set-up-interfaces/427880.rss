    <description>yea i need a little help maybe a tut.
lets say i click a book and i want sumtin simple like a page to come up and it be scrollable. ik u can do it in deltas. ik its in the client.java file too.

my real purpose would be to use it for quests. u go to the quest tab and click the quest name then u open up the interface (all ik how to do except open up interface). then u write ur progress of quest and what u have completed is crossed out. ik how to make it so aas you progress it shows that would be like
if (q1progress &gt;= 1)
{show whatever}
i can figure that out.</description>
