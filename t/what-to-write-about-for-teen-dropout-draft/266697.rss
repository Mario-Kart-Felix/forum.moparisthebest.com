    <title>What to write about for teen dropout draft?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-to-write-about-for-teen-dropout-draft/266697</link>
    <description>Well I need to have this draft done by tomorrow, I didn&#39;t have much time for anything until now which leaves me with.... 7 hours until school. Yeah I know im late, but I really need this grade to pass :|.

I need at least 3 paragraphs
[*] The overall introduction
[+]Teen
[*] The detailed body of the introduction
[*] And the conclusion

What I got so far:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[center][b]
[size=14pt]TEEN DROPOUT[/size]
[size=10pt]by Jarod Billingslea[/size]
[/b][/center]

It cannot always be ascertained that a student has dropped out, as he or she may stop attending their school without terminating enrollment. Reasons are varied and may include: to find work, avoid bullying, family emergency, poor grades, unexpected pregnancy, bad environment, lack of freedom, and boredom from lack of lessons relevant to the world of work.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
