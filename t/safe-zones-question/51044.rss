    <title>Safe Zones Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/safe-zones-question/51044</link>
    <description>K.. i have a pimpscape source and everyone knows it lets you pk in the varrock streets right? anyway.. I added a safezone around horvik&#39;s smithing shop in varrock because i just added the bars to that store.. and the whole varrock zone is now a safe zone? can anyone help? i got my coords right and everything from the southwest part of the shop to the northeast part of the shop. You can only pk if you go above that coord or if you go west of the southwest one. Not east of the one coord or south of the coord. I have over 30 players that want to pk there in varrock but there are some that want to smith their own stuff and pkers attack the smithers so i need help</description>
