              <p>The colours are changed every time you refresh the runescape page (e.g. to stop autoers) thats why you have to reset them.</p>
<p>Or i believe you can still use scarscape which is a runescape client which doesnt change the colours… have a search for it.</p>
<p>And i dont know why you have to enter your password? maybe is because it has “auto login” and it needs to use ure password to do that…</p>
