    <title>I need help [667]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-667/539877</link>
    <description>Hello guys, sorry for the broad title. This is for a 667:

I want to make like a minigame (using one place) for all my players, but so when they tele there they can&#39;t see each other, or each other&#39;s npcs, or each other&#39;s objects, so it&#39;s like they&#39;re in their own world.

What I need to know is how do I make the players not see each other (when in this place), how to make it so they aren&#39;t killing the same npcs, and how to make it so they can&#39;t see the same objects (so it can be randomized)...
Thanks guys.</description>

Any other alternatives?<br>
I am currently trying to do this (though i dont know how):<br>
Make the objects and npcs viewable by one person (so it only spawns for that person) and then make them like the ::hide command… Any tuts or suggestions on this would be appreciated.</p>

</aside>
<p>Would this work for a place that is already made?<br>
Like, for example:<br>
I want to use varrock, would this work?</p>
<p>-----Edit-----<br>
Also, i can only go to height level 3 <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
