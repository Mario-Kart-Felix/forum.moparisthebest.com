<p>You have very low information.</p>
<p>1: Did you portforward right?<br>
2: Did you enable the port on your firewall?<br>
3: Dd you get no-ip duc?<br>
4: did you check if you had putted in the right ip in the ipv4 when you type cmd?<br>
5: did you compile?<br>
6: Is some of the client file missing?</p>
<p>i believe i protforwarded right, i enabled the port, yup i got that its running still, i typed that ip into my client.java, and server.java yes, i did compile, and no</p>
<p>As you can see i asked alot of basic Questions there because you didn’t put enought information.[/quote]</p>
