    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-we-get-people-banned-just-for-being-complete-retards/402964</link>
    <description>I was on server today and my game got completely ruined by these guys. Must admit the convo on this image is meh but the rest of it made me  :eek:
Was wondering if there was anything we could do to stop this crap? Also if there&#39;s any rules about language and slang on the server.

<p>Is it possible to ban their IP addresses? Also muting is a good idea I reckon.</p>
