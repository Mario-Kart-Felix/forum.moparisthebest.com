    <title>NPC Spawning Error?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-spawning-error/438790</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to spawn some NPC&#39;s with a PI base and this is what happens.

[code]Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError
Caused by: java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: &quot;945 3095    3108
   0   2&quot;
        at java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(Unknown Source)
        at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Unknown Source)
        at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Unknown Source)

        at server.model.npcs.NPCHandler.&lt;init&gt;(NPCHandler.java:39)
        at server.Server.&lt;clinit&gt;(Server.java:63)
Could not find the main class: server.Server.  Program will exit.[/code]

This is the NPC I am trying to spawn:
[code]// npc                 spawnX    spawnY   height      walk/face
spawn = 945 3095    3108    0   2[/code]

This is a NPC that already works being spawned:
[code]spawn = 81	2924	3281	0	1[/code]

Any help would be much appreciated.

-I was looking in the npcsounds.cfg file and noticed there were sounds for the NPC&#39;s that I could spawn and nothing for NPC&#39;s that can&#39;t be spawned right now.


[b]Just realized just by posting here. Viewed NPCHandler and realized that the spaces between the id&#39;s were tabs. 

No Help needed anymore.[/b]</description>
