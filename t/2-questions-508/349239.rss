    <title>2 questions - [508]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2-questions-508/349239</link>
    <description>Ok well hopefully these will be my last 2 questions cuz ive made like 2-3 others i believe today, but anyways, 
1st question.

In my server when a player dies they lose nothing unless a player kills them. 
I want to make it where they keep the 3 most valuable items they have(it would judge from items.cfg i guess.

How could I do this?

And another question.
I like to keep alot of items, about 110, in my bank and have 2147m(2b147m) of each item. However in this source I&#39;m using only about 20 of the items show up, like i&#39;ll add all 100 log out, edit it in the source file thingy where there will be max of each, but theres only 20/100 items in the bank, the rest just magically disappear. How can I make it where this won&#39;t happen, if theres a way. PS i think its only if u have large amounts of each item idk=\</description>
