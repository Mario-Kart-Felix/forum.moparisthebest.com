    <title>[317] How do I rename Objects?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-how-do-i-rename-objects/389299</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, I wanted to make a City Teleport room, so you dont have to walk everywhere etc, and commands are annoying for when Pking etc ppl just tele away.. But yeh lets get to the point, I have got a portal named Trollheim Teleport, but I want to rename it to Rellekka Teleport, because you need to get there for quests and stuff, and Trollheim is pointless..
I once did this with NPCs and Items, so it must be possible with objects too I think? Any one knows what class it is in? I tried searching for ObjectID, objectID, etc but I couldnt find any..
(I have got Bluurrs client, Delta base I know thats server side but idk just sayin)
Please post any!</description>
