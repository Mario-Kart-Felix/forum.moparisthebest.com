    <description>Ok well I recently added Ganodermic to my PI server and it works fine up until the point that when I wear the visor and poncho you can see through them so I looked up how to fix that and I fixed the poncho but when I try to fix the visor you can still see through the visor, can someone help me with this please?
To fix the poncho I went in to 
1.Item.Java
2public static boolean playerBody(int itemId) {
3. , &quot;Poncho&quot;,
4.private static String[] fullbody = {
5. , &quot;Poncho&quot;
6.Compile, log in and boom it was fixed!!!

But now when I do that with my visor it does not work and I have no idea why, here is what I tried.

1.Item.Java
2.public static boolean playerHats(int itemId) {
3. , &quot;Visor&quot;,
4.private static String[] fullmask = {
5. , &quot;Visor&quot;
6.Compile, log in and it does not work :(

Fixed!!!!

What I did was add stats to the visor and it should work.</description>
