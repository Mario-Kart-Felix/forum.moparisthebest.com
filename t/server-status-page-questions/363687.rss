    <description>Can everybody stop posting questions about the server status page (legit question :))? FAQs are there for a reason.

[quote=&quot;Moparisthebest, post:1, topic:275446&quot;]F.A.Q:

Q: When will my server be removed from the status page?

           A: [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,363862.msg2967383.html#msg2967383]Your server will be deleted from status page after it&#39;s uptime drops below 40 percent.[/url]

Q: My server fell below 100% uptime, can someone remove it from the list for me?

           A: [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,363862.msg2938139.html#msg2938139]Moparisthebest is the only one that can, no other staff has access to it, but he will not remove your server from the status page.  Don&#39;t PM him about it.  No exceptions.[/url]

Q: My server fell below 100% uptime, can it ever go back up to 100%?

           A: Yes, it [i]can[/i], but only because it rounds the percentage off.  So once your server gets above 99.5% it will round it up and appear as 100%.

Q: Will a &quot;remove server&quot; button be added to the status page?
 
           A: [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,363862.msg2780861.html#msg2780861]No, this will never happen.[/url]

Q: How often is my server checked?

           A: [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,363862.msg2958908.html#msg2958908]About every 30 minutes.[/url]

Q: Your page shows my server as offline, when it is actually online because me and my friends are on it.

           A: Just because your server is online for you or your friends, doesn&#39;t mean it is online for my server or others.  There could be network congestion between our two servers, or even a break in the internet that hasn&#39;t been routed around yet.  Also my script must check sometimes 1000+ servers every 30 minutes, so it can&#39;t spend valuable time waiting for a response from you, if you don&#39;t respond in the given time it marks you as offline.[/quote]</description>
