    <description>Hello, I&#39;m in need of a coder for a RS Private server.

I need someone who can do a wide variety of things, and doesn&#39;t have too much trouble with it, I am yet to get a source and set it all up, but if you&#39;re willing to help, let me know.  I&#39;m willing to give you definite Admin/Mod.

I am also willing to actually pay you in CAD currency via paypal, the payment will be sent once a month.
Please let me know how much you want to get paid, and I&#39;ll think about it and get back to you.

I don&#39;t want someone who&#39;s still new at it, no offence, I need someone who knows what their doing, and will add new things to a source, once I get one, and I also need someone to help me set one up.

I will also get a dedicated host if the server is good after the coding is done.

My MSN Messanger address is - leroux_b@hotmail.com

P.S - I&#39;m looking for a server that had most or all of the skills working , a prayer altar (more than just burrying exp), mage, range, attack, strength, hp, defence all trained on monsters, not bookcases or any nonsense like that, normal wilderness without mass-clicking, and some other stuff, please add me on MSN or drop me a PM if you&#39;re interested.</description>
