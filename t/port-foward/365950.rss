    <description>Hello, Can anyone help me to open ports on my router?
Iv&#39;e open and some friends tried but it still won&#39;t work so other can connect.

Iv&#39;e looked on tutorials and on portfowarding.com
I got teamwiever and msn so you can remote acsess it.

Would be very kind if someone can help me figure out this problem.
It&#39;s an thomsson router, (had another before so this one is shit)

*EDIT* CLOSE TOPIC.

Removed the uPnP and now worked</description>

              <p>You need to open, Run &gt; Cmd &gt; type ‘’ ipconfig ‘’ and type your default gateway into web browser &gt; Game &amp; Sharing Application &gt; Create new game application (Select manual entry of ports and rename this whatever your like where it asks, Id suggest the port number your forwarding so you know. &gt; Next &gt; Now keep ‘’ protocol as ‘’ any ‘’ port range add the port you want forwarding ie. 80 to 80. Translate to keep this blank, Trigger protocol blank, Trigger port blank, And click add. Now go back to the Game and sharing application page, Click Assign game or application to local network device and then on the drop down arrow menu, Search for the entry you just created, Whatever you named it as. And select it, And select the device. Click add. And you should be set.</p>
<p>To test its forwarded go to <a href="http://www.canyouseeme.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.canyouseeme.org/</a> and check the ports you’ve forwarded. It will tell you if there open.</p>
