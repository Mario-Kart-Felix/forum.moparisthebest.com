    <title>Problem with port forwarding?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-port-forwarding/349200</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know why but nothing I do works.
I could probably get it to work except my router is broken or something.
I can&#39;t get onto its setup page! Does it have to be plugged into my modem?
Cause I&#39;m using wireless internet.
Its like verizons usb modem except a different network and there&#39;s no ethernet ports on it.
I try 192.168.1.1 and all the other numbers people have told me.
But everytime it says internet explorer cannot display the webpage.
I tried to factory reset my router but nothing happened.
Is it not installed on my computer properly?
I never used the setup cd but it seems fine because it picks up my internet so I can play xbox live. And if I don&#39;t do it through my router, I tried to use torrents too.
I read the guides and followed them perfectly.
I set up a no-ip.
The torrent and the no-ip DUC are running.
I opened client.java for my source and my client and set them both to my no-ip as the default address. Compiled it all with no errors.
But then my friend downloaded the client and it wouldn&#39;t work.
My source is running.
I was connected to it.
My environment variables are set.
People can connect through hamachi fine.
But no one does that anymore.
So what is wrong?
Oh and I posted this from my phone so I can&#39;t go on team viewer or anything right now.
I just wanted to know if this error is fixable.
Need more info?
Ill check my post every 5 mins.</description>
