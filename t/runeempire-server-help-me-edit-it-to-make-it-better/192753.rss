    <description>Im trying to make a server just like Runescape!
Its name is RuneEmpire!
So far it&#39;s completely blank! There are No NPC&#39;s... there&#39;s just the land, building&#39;s, tree&#39;s ect.
It&#39;s like a blank Runescape!
So it brings me to ask some requests:
1: can somebody fix the tele spells so that when you tele you dont get stuck and have to restart your client.
2: can somebody fix all the spells so they only work with the correct runes and Lvls.
3: can somebody add the ability to costumize your character when they first make their account and log in.
4: can somebody add working duel arena with staking in al-kharid and get rid of those custom shops there.
5: can somebody fix running to work properly with 100% energy that drains when you run.
6: can somebody change the ability to PK anywhere you want, and make it so you can only pk in the wilderness.
7: and can somebody add wilderness Lvls!!!

Ofcourse if you fix these problems I will give you credit!
I think I can make the shops and NPC&#39;s and quests and the rest of the stuff(but if you would like to help me out there too that would be GREAT!!! :D).

the source for RuneEmpire Server is Attached!!!
P.S. If you &quot;CAN NOT&quot; fix it for me please tell me how or send me a link!</description>

              <p>Umm…mabey you shouldn’t let others download the server or they will be able to use it, and you should only get a few people to do these things by making a “development team”, I’m sure you know what that is.</p>
