    <title>Iraqi: I&#39;m proud my WMD lies led to war in Iraq</title>

    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;LONDON – An Iraqi man whose testimony the United States used as a key evidence to build a case for war in Iraq says he is proud that he [b]lied about his country developing mobile biological warfare lab[/b]s.

The Guardian newspaper published an interview Wednesday with Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi, who has been identified as the informer called &quot;Curveball,&quot;[b] whose claims about weapon labs formed part of then-U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell&#39;s speech to the U.N. Security Council in 2003, shortly before the war began.[/b]

The Guardian quoted al-Janabi as saying:[size=12pt][b] &quot;I had the chance to fabricate something to topple the regime. I and my sons are proud of that.&quot;[/b][/size]

Although some intelligence agents were skeptical of Curveball&#39;s story, the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee reported in 2004 that the Central Intelligence Agency &quot;withheld important information about Curveball&#39;s reliability&quot; from analysts dealing with the case.

The Guardian interviewed al-Janabi in Karlsruhe, Germany in a mixture of Arabic and German. The U.S. Senate panel&#39;s report said Curveball spoke in English and Arabic when he was interrogated by intelligence officers.

[b]Asked about his feeling&#39;s about the deaths and destruction during the war and in the years following, The Guardian said al-Janabi said there was no other way.[/b]

[b]&quot;I tell you something when I hear anybody not just in Iraq but in any war (is) killed, I am very sad. But give me another solution. Can you give me another solution?&quot; the newspaper quoted him as saying.[/b]

[b]&quot;Saddam did not (allow) freedom in our land,&quot; the Iraqi said. &quot;There are no other political parties. You have to believe what Saddam says, and do what Saddam wants. And I don&#39;t accept that. I have to do something for my country. So I did this and I am satisfied, because there is no dictator in Iraq any more.&quot;[/b]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Very interesting, all bias aside.</description>

              <p>Wow I cant believe the story has been spun this way. I read the interview in the Guardian and their interpretation seems much better.<br>
The many western democratic governments lied to their people because they wanted to go to war. That’s really bad. If you look at the next electon in the UK, well, see wikipedia.</p>
<blockquote>Blair's decline in popularity was largely attributed to the decision to send British troops to invade Iraq in 2003. The 2005 election also saw Britain gain more independent and small party members of parliament than it had done for 60 years.</blockquote>
<p>Okay so an Iraqi man wanted coalition forces to invade but theres many countries run by bad people who we don’t invade. I’m sure plenty of Zimbabweans, Egyptians, Rwandans, Burmese and Sri Lankans want their dictator removed but thats not a good enough reason for the west to invade them.</p>

<p>So what does this mean? Now knowing that key evidence that led to the war was falsified, is America going to pull out?</p>

</aside>
<p>This was know before the war, why does countries use spies when they don’t listen to them. It would be a simple case to confirm WMD in Iraq if they know about them. But since they never checked and intelligence agency told them there was little reason for WMD, it shows that USA never cared for evidence.</p>
