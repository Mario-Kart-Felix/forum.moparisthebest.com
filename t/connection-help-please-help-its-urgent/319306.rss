    <description>After like 3 monthes of failed tries , finally my dad agreed to help me.

My dad works with computers all the time and he knows about computers , anyway , he helped me to open the 43594 port correctly and setted up the dyndns ( its like no-ip ) but now I have an error he doesn&#39;t know how to fix.

The server window shows the he gets connections but it rejects them everytime I connect , here is a picture :

As you see , there are 6 connections , I tried to connect 3 times from each client , I thought the problem is in my client but I tried 2 clients that 100% work and still the same error!

PLEASE HELP ME , IF YOU KNOW HOW TO FIX IT AND WHAT IS CAUSING THIS ERROR , PLEASE COMMENT!!!</description>
