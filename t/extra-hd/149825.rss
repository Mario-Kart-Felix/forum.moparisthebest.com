    <title>Extra HD</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/extra-hd/149825</link>
    <description>I&#39;m running out of disk space, and I don&#39;t want to delete anything. I still have this second computer, but I dont want to get rid of it completely. So I have a third computer, that has a 4gb HD. My plan is to put the 4gb HD into my second computer, and put the HD from the second computer into my first computer. But I have some questions:

The 4gb HD has windows 95 on it, and I want xp on it. How do I format it and get xp on it? Just with the winxp cd?

Can I just put in the HD from the second computer into the first one, without reformatting it? Because it still has winxp on it, and will that cause any problems? I think it wont.

I think my answers are right, but just to be sure I post my questions here. I don&#39;t want to end up destroying 3 HD&#39;s.

Thanks in advance.</description>
