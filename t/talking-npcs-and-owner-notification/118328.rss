<p>Open your NPCHandler.java and search for:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">thug life</code></pre>
<p>It should look something like, not exactly like:</p>
<p><code>if (npcs[i].npcType == 2168) {
						if (misc.random2(30) == 1) {
							npcs[i].updateRequired = true;
							npcs[i].textUpdateRequired = true;
							npcs[i].textUpdate = "Bla bla bla";
						}
					}</code></p>
<p>Where it says npcs[i].textUpdate = “…”; change the thug life to whatever you want that NPC to say.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">also how do i make the writing at the top change from Owner = fr33sc4p3 to<br>
Owner = Owner Blain</span></p>
<p>Open your client.java and search for:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">fr33sc4p3</code></pre>
<p>Then replace that with Owner Blain.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">and i know aout how to make myself admin, i just cant remember which file its on</span></p>
<p>In your folder where you see your client.java etc, there’s a folder called Characters. Your name should be in there.</p>
