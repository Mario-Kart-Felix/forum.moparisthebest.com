    <title>Naive Game Engine</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/naive-game-engine/414324</link>
    <description>Well, this past summer I spent some of my time developing a Game Engine. It&#39;s a simple 2d Game Engine that I&#39;m going to develop basic games in. As for the basic game engine, I haven&#39;t developed much at all. Basic rendering and such. Working on the architecture of engine mainly so far. Anyways, I&#39;ve developed several tools which are near completion, just I need to do a bit of rework on it. I also got to finiliaze my cache format. 

I don&#39;t have any pictures of the engine considering it&#39;s still very basic, but I will upload pictures soon. I&#39;m currently using LWJGL library for all of my rendering. 

Anyways, here&#39;s a picture of the tile creator. Tiles are create and stored in .json files. As for whether or not the tile is walk-able, I&#39;m going to handle that using the map editor, not the tile creator. A little change I need to make.

Map Editor, going to start developing layers next for this. This already does have a file format.

edit: I&#39;m very new to the game development world, so any suggestions would be great.</description>

              <p>Ultimately the tile visual representation will end up in texture memory on the GPU, so how you organize it on the engine does not matter. What matters is how it’s laid out on the GPU. It’s much better to have 1 big texture containing N tiles, than N textures, containing 1 tile each.</p>
<p>How you do that depends. If your maps are streamed, you might as well duplicate the tile in different textures, because it will be faster. You can also do it at runtime, by packing tiles dynamically. That’s how most GUI systems work.</p>

If you’re reusing tiles in different maps, doesn’t a global tile id system work better?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Maybe, what is a ‘gobal tile id system’?[/quote]</p>
<p>for example lets say you are using the same sand tile in 20 different maps hes suggesting each tile have an id maybe a shortvalue so for the sake of the example the sand tile’s id is 433 that means the game should access the cache and look for tile id 433 and load what is required</p>

I would compress the pixels into some kind of dataformat and have the engine define all the metadata that’s in, say PNG. That way you can minimize the size significiantly.<br>

Wouldn’t PNG be more suitable for this considering the file size would be significantly smaller and basically has the same quality as JPEG (the tile is on a small scale as it is)?</p>

Does seem like a good idea to develop a game off of someone else’s 2d game engine to learn game mechanics I suppose.</p>
<p>As for the tile editor, tiles are loaded off a sprite sheet that is also loaded with a json configuration file (the Tile Editor creates this). From there, the sprite sheet is divided into individual sprites based up on the configuration that was loaded from the json file.</p>
<p>edit: The “Select Color” and “Opacity” is for the little selection box, (selection box)which corresponds with the combo boxes.</p>
