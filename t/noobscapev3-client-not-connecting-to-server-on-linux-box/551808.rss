    <title>NOOBscapev3 Client not connecting to server on Linux box</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/noobscapev3-client-not-connecting-to-server-on-linux-box/551808</link>
    <description>Hello!

I&#39;m not super knowledgable in any of this but I&#39;m having fun with it and ran into a roadblock that I&#39;m hoping for help with!

I have a linux server running ubuntu 14.04 x64 that I got working with the noobscape server and client while running on the server. (server is not in my house its hosted).

When I run a client on my server using VNC using &quot;localhost&quot; it works fine.. When I use the IP or NO-IP I created it does not connect whether I&#39;m running client off my server or off my home computer.

I feel like I have tried everything though I&#39;m sure I haven&#39;t :)..

I would really appreciate if anyone knows a fix for this issue no matter how silly it probably ends up being!

Thank you in advance.

Matt

Edit: Fixed. I discovered the game was listening for the port only on &quot;localhost&quot;. I had to edit server.java I think it was with my IP.</description>
