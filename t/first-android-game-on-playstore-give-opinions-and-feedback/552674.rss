    <title>First Android Game - On PlayStore - Give Opinions and Feedback</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/first-android-game-on-playstore-give-opinions-and-feedback/552674</link>
    <description>Well, was messing around with the Unity Engine. Made my first game.
Would appreciate anyone to test it/rate it.

Leave your honest opinions and suggestions. I&#39;d love to make it something that people actually enjoy.

The theme for the game was, &quot;Annoyingly hard&quot; - the same pretences as the infamous &quot;Flappy Bird&quot;.

Here&#39;s the Link to the game on the Android App Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.MichboardINC.GreenLight

I will be posting my Progress / Adding of content

=Features=
-Google Play integration
--Sign in with your google account
--Achievements for score 
--Highscore list for your score

=Updates=
Version 1.1
-Changed Main Menu to fit screen Properly
-Added Google Play Integration
--Achievements,Highscore Leadboards
-Fixed Game Crash error when turning screen into portrait mode
-Fixed spacing and boxes for Text to display properly.
-Added Buttons on main menu to show achievements and leaderboards
-Added Jumping Sound
-Added 8-Bit Type Music

Version 1.15
-Added animated background for main menu, and game screen
-Changed Fonts to a more Game style
-Changed player sprite to single unit
-Added a make-shift jump animation(nothing fancy, I suck at art....)
-Made new PlayerPreferences(Death Count Total, Successful Jump Total)
-Added new Death Achievements
-Re-allocated achievement points to allow for future achievement realeases.
-Added &quot;Game Over&quot; screen, allowing user to see played score, and their current Highscore.

Version 1.16(Currently being pushed on Google Play Store - Takes 1-4 hours for Formal Publication)
-Fixed Game Over Screen Size(My silly self forgot to portion the UI based on Screen Size.... DERP!!)
Version 1.161
-Fixed Game Over Text being off screen(Novice issues, bare with me... Lol)

==Working On==
-Options Menu(Toggle Sounds, Music)

==Hopes for Future Updates==
-Character Selection(Male, Female, Different Figures(Both natural and funny))
---Hold Back on Charcter Selection(Must create Jump Animations for each Character that is choosable. Again, I&#39;m terrible with ART)
-Better music on game
-Better looking Game Icon
-Better looking App Store images.(Looks very basic, but the game is quite basic)
-Better looking GUI
-Better All-Around Sprites(I would like some type of unity. Charcters design needs to match backgrounds design)
-More Achievements
-More Leaderboards(Possibly death leaderboard?)
-More Secure(Game is currently saving variables in a playerPrefs file on the device. Easily editable;therefor, causing leaderboards to be potentially &quot;Not-Fair&quot;</description>

Mine never had this occur, but you just never know what’s gonna work out. The mobile market it much more suited to just making games for the hell of it and seeing if anyone plays it. Never do anything crazy like quit your job or anything because that market doesn’t work like that.</p>

<p>The mobile platform isn’t what everyone who’s never been part of it says it’s like. Don’t expect any exposure, or any hits or anything like that. Just make simple little games for the hell of it. I remember my first game, we got like 100 downloads, made like $0.03 on ads (which I never saw). Good job, use this as a step to keep on going.</p>
