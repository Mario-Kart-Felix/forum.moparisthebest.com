<p>I wouldn’t define “great” as someone paying a bunch of inexperienced developers to all program a single server that fails all of the stability tests, and has also had its Alpha delayed again and again and again.</p>
<p>All they did was copy the look of Jagex’s old website, which we have also done. It promptly resulted in a nice DMCA notice from Jagex, so we scrapped that. This is not a hobby project; we just don’t give any random person access to the code. 06Scape’s source has been leaked many times, it isn’t good.</p>
<p>He also gets all his money by making his users “donate” for access to the Alpha that has still not been released. We believe that the server should be free. If people want to throw a ton of money at us and deal with the legal problems of copying Jagex’s old layout, then we’ll go that route.</p>

</aside>
<p>Explain to me how it is the ‘greatest rsps project’ I believe Frugooscape was the best success known to RSPS. And to say that money will win is exactly why they shouldn’t be around. They charge people membership, expect people to donate to them, they pay people to code for them, they run around shoving their server down people’s throat and for what? A server that is going to be a buggy, laggy, and crappy version of RuneScape ran by a 15 year old who can’t keep his emails/domain name secure? How many times has he been hacked? How many times has their domains been taken over? All their project is going to be is a major let down. What people see is what they call a “success”. What I see is a corrupt version of Jagex that is just leading people to believe they can do this. When in their video’s you see they can’t.</p>
<p>We sit here showing you guys all this work we’re doing and to have other people from their server who are brainwashed to believe what they tell you come here and blast our thread telling us to give up. We are not going to give up. We are not going to give up. We are not in here for the money like they are. If RuneRebels doesn’t make a dime, it will still go on. If RuneRebels loses money it will still go on. I have paid a few hundred dollars into RuneRebels to insure this project continues.</p>
<p>I find it funny that you continue to come here and try to say how all these other servers are better then us. How about you try to work on something of your own that isn’t a failure. Maybe something that is actually playable. I am talking about “Frontier 443”<br>
I know I have no room to talk since I have never done anything related to that, but you are insulting ry60003333 who created the server single handed. He also made the first server to load multiple versions. Nobody to this day has done this. Want to know the great thing? We don’t have to stop with a “2006 remake” I mean hell, we can go back and do a 05, or even 04 remake.</p>

I wouldn’t define “great” as someone paying a bunch of inexperienced developers to all program a single server that fails all of the stability tests, and has also had its Alpha delayed again and again and again.</p>
<p>All they did was copy the look of Jagex’s old website, which we have also done. It promptly resulted in a nice DMCA notice from Jagex, so we scrapped that. This is not a hobby project; we just don’t give any random person access to the code. 06Scape’s source has been leaked many times, it isn’t good.</p>
<p>He also gets all his money by making his users “donate” for access to the Alpha that has still not been released. We believe that the server should be free. If people want to throw a ton of money at us and deal with the legal problems of copying Jagex’s old layout, then we’ll go that route.[/quote]</p>

<p>This coming from the person who lied about their update times? Get real. Blakeman is a professional programmer who runs successful projects outside of google; as the creator of Runesource he has a privatized version that is substantially better than his original public release. The base is considered one of the most well designed and stable, their only issue is that their SQL database is onshore but their website and servers are not so there is a huge latency leading to ‘stability issues’.</p>

<p>More butthurt, and ignorance. Also, guess what, I can take an Apollo and do the same thing you guys can do. Shocking. Also instead of focusing on your features and ‘engine’ updates work on building notoriety. It’s where I failed in my projects and I’m inclined to share that nugget of wisdom.</p>
<p>If you both thought that you actually stood a chance you would have ignored me (yeah man we totally beat 06scape we have character and we care for our players, even though that doesn’t really measure up in a larger user base huehuehue) but now I pointed out a pink elephant.

You can say you are morally more sound than they are but I instead think you should idealistically look towards using them as a model for success, seeing as how they are successful.</p>

<p>I did not lie about my update times? If you read the entire topic, you would have seen my post that explained how the server ticks faster then 600 MS; it actually ticks at 100 MS to run events that are not timed within game time. We have updated our command to show the last seven ticks; the tick that does the player updating took ~100-200 MS during the bot testing.</p>
<p>And thats great for him, if he wants to use that to make a server more power to him.</p>

If you want us to build notoriety, why not try and help us do that? We know that we need that, we just need some help getting it. I have been looking for soft of a “PR” team to build hype about the server; why not have the best of both worlds, a strong engine, great features, and great publicity?</p>

<p>You are obviously not going to listen to anyone. We are just going to settle with the fact that we know what we have done, and what we are capable of doing. You say this is a ‘hobby’. Consider this, that we have been running the server “WorldScape” for 5, going on 6 years. With very minor downtime. If it was just a ‘hobby’ we would have stopped years ago. If it was just a ‘hobby’ we wouldn’t have made a topic.</p>
<p>Have a great day, because I know you will.<br>
I know I surely am going to have a fantastic day, we are sitting here all chatting with each-other as we speak, working on RuneRebels gettin’ shit done.</p>

        <p>Even though you guys are competition to my server, props on also being free to play. That’s the main thing that annoys me about the big project, that people need to donate to play an alpha that isn’t even out yet. I understand that the owner is a 13 year old that cant fund it otherwise, but meh. sinisoul is right about one thing, Blakeman is a good programmer. Definitely not the rest, but assuming Blakeman is doing quality control (I really hope he is), then it shouldn’t be bad quality code. They definitely can’t stick to release dates though, and player base size has nothing to do with quality. Frankly, it exploded by word of mouth because people just wanted SOMETHING from 2006 to play, and at first glance it looked the part, making it seem like the only available remake to people that had never been a part of the scene before.</p>
<p>Anyways… some website CC:<br>
Black font on red background is hard to read<br>
The hiscores page has way too much whitespace and I think the table rows need some sort of distinction (even just a border or slightly alternating background colors)<br>
The logo just looks like generated cooltext</p>

        <p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:412, topic:440454”]Even though you guys are competition to my server, props on also being free to play. That’s the main thing that annoys me about the big project, that people need to donate to play an alpha that isn’t even out yet. I understand that the owner is a 13 year old that cant fund it otherwise, but meh. sinisoul is right about one thing, Blakeman is a good programmer. Definitely not the rest, but assuming Blakeman is doing quality control (I really hope he is), then it shouldn’t be bad quality code. They definitely can’t stick to release dates though, and player base size has nothing to do with quality. Frankly, it exploded by word of mouth because people just wanted SOMETHING from 2006 to play, and at first glance it looked the part, making it seem like the only available remake to people that had never been a part of the scene before.</p>
<p>Anyways… some website CC:<br>
Black font on red background is hard to read<br>
The hiscores page has way too much whitespace and I think the table rows need some sort of distinction (even just a border or slightly alternating background colors)<br>
The logo just looks like generated cooltext[/quote]<br>
Free to play is good! <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/coolae52.png?v=5" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"> And competition is good too, it just sucks with the greedy terrible competition is winning. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
But yeah I wouldn’t argue that Blakeman isn’t a good programmer, from what I’ve seen he is a very good programmer!<br>
But it does suck how they gain popularity like that.</p>
<p>Also thanks for the suggestions! We do need a new SMF theme for the forum, a new highscore layout (I’m not experienced with HTML/CSS), and I suck at artwork as you can tell. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
