10/10 did not read your wall of text because it is a wall of text. Also, the frequency of getting on the computer has nothing to do with one‚Äôs ability to write without run-on paragraphs. Most countries attempt to teach students how to correctly write in their language of choosing, so even if English is not your first language you <span class="bbcode-b">should</span> know how to properly construct sentences and paragraphs in order to keep whatever you are writing coherent. It may look bigger, but it is easier to take on multiple paragraphs and allow us to read it in chunks than for anyone to try such a mind-numbing task such as reading what you put. The odds of anyone reading that are slim, and there is even less of a chance of retaining all of it when it looks like that.</p>
<p>If you can‚Äôt understand how this matters, you will when you attempt to submit papers necessary for you to pass something in your life (Exams, state/country tests, career related papers, etc.). I would suggest learning proper grammar, spelling, sentence structure, and everything else you‚Äôre missing.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm going to go ahead and squash this right here and now. (James from AllGoFree/RuneRebels/WorldScape).</p>
<p>First off, your ‚Äústory‚Äù is irrelevant, chat logs speak for themselves which have been seen by all of the staff and owners. Second off, I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúrollback‚Äù the forums (completely retarded for you to say that, there‚Äôs really no way to ‚Äúrollback‚Äù the forums, we don‚Äôt back them up every 10 minutes or something ridiculous like that,) the topic was deleted BY RYAN for Spamming/Flaming, which is against the rules. What rule? Read this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spamming<br>
Please do not make any type of spam posts, or make topics out of their section on the forums. Spam posts include: Goodbye threads, threads about server status, flame threads, and anything else that doesn‚Äôt have a place on our forums.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thirdly, you also broke other rules (one that I disagree with, but it is a rule nonetheless) by threatening, attempting to manipulate, and attempting to intimidate a staff member. Here‚Äôs the rules for your consideration:</p>
<p>Forum Rule:<br>
4. Mistreating Staff.<br>
Please do not abuse or mistreat staff. Treat them as if they are ‚Äòpolice officers‚Äô of the RuneRebels world.</p>
<p>In-game rule:<br>
11. Disrespecting staff<br>
Please do not disrespect any member of the staff. The staff have a mute and ban option, and they will use it!</p>
<p>When did you break this rule? Well, I‚Äôd love to post the forum topic. But, since it has been deleted, I‚Äôll go ahead and post this little tid-bit:</p>

<p>And in regards to being called ‚Äútyrannical‚Äù I‚Äôm lol‚Äôing. I‚Äôve been apart of AllGoFree for almost eight years now, and I can count on my hands how many people I‚Äôve taken any account action on, and I‚Äôm extremely happy to add you to the list.</p>
<p>Now, go ahead and move on. You‚Äôre not getting unbanned, WE DON‚ÄôT WANT YOU BACK. No offense to David, but he‚Äôs extremely wrong. What you are doing to our topic is neither wanted, nor warranted, and I‚Äôll continue to report your posts on here until they‚Äôre removed, based on this rule right here:</p>
<p>Rule 12:<br>
We respect each other and other communities. We do not flame. There is to be no fighting on the forums.</p>
<p>John was doing his ‚Äújob‚Äù (I hate calling it that, since it‚Äôs not like he gets paid) properly. Ryan would remove the posts himself, but he‚Äôs a shy guy and doesn‚Äôt want to be criticized for cleaning up his own topic. We don‚Äôt ‚Äúwant‚Äù this discussion to be continued. We want to be the adults here and walk away, unlike one individual.</p>
<p><em>EDIT</em></p>
<p>Also, you were not banned from Worldscape. Your account was flagged by our spam email detector, which we got off another RSPS. Apparently, this isn‚Äôt the first time you‚Äôve gotten in trouble on an RSPS. Maybe you should move on from the community in general?</p>
<p><em>DOUBLEEDIT</em></p>
<p>And our other RSPS has nothing to do with wanting to get RuneRebels ‚Äúshut down.‚Äù Yes, we‚Äôve discussed shutting RR down over the past few weeks, but it definitely isn‚Äôt because of Worldscape. Why would we shut down a server with ~5 players on at a time to focus our staff on a really old server that only hardcore veterans of the server play? It makes no sense. Plus, I‚Äôm the lone developer of Worldscape for now, it doesn‚Äôt NEED staff, it‚Äôs dead too. ANNNND, you fail to mention that it was more than just YOU banned. Elevate and Recoil were also banned for flaming, and we‚Äôre going to have a no tolerance policy for it going forward.</p>
<p>In server news, Ryan and I have just completed the Halloween Event! It‚Äôs fun, everyone should try it out!</p>

10/10 did not read your wall of text because it is a wall of text. Also, the frequency of getting on the computer has nothing to do with one‚Äôs ability to write without run-on paragraphs.

It may look bigger, but it is easier to take on multiple paragraphs and allow us to read it in chunks than for anyone to try such a mind-numbing task such as reading what you put. The odds of anyone reading that are slim, and there is even less of a chance of retaining all of it when it looks like that.</p>
<p>If you can‚Äôt understand how this matters, you will when you attempt to submit papers necessary for you to pass something in your life (Exams, state/country tests, career related papers, etc.).

<p>Elevate played. Recoil played. I actually cannot edit the blocked email list, it‚Äôs something only Ryan can mess with. Ryan gets on during class, it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs in middle school or hischool. Don‚Äôt know why your email is on the blocked list, but it is. I didn‚Äôt make the police officer analogy, the rules were actually made by JT (former administrator) and approved by us. I‚Äôm not comparing myself to a police officer, or anything of that matter. I‚Äôm stating the rules. Also, we could ban you for whatever we wanted, even if it‚Äôs not justified.</p>
<p>You didn‚Äôt put any money in my pocket, you put money in Ryan‚Äôs pocket which in turn pays for the server. I‚Äôve donated over $1000 to keep both RR and WS up (have the receipts to back that up) so the amount of money you donated does not help ME in the slightest, it helps the server. And trust me, I would post what you said on the forums, but I can‚Äôt, and you know that. Negative things were said by multiple people on that topic, which was why it was deleted.</p>
<p>And if you‚Äôre over it, go ahead and move on. We‚Äôll do the same. There‚Äôs no need for you to post on our topics anymore.</p>

        <p>Alright I think it‚Äôs time for me to input on this.</p>
<p>Tennessee, I don‚Äôt know why you keep insisting that I didn‚Äôt play the game. I played the game quite frequently. You‚Äôre also acting as if I, and others, had no right to be within the community. Even if Recoil, James and I didn‚Äôt play the game often we‚Äôre still entitled to posting on the Runerebels forums, It‚Äôs a public website. Meaning ANYONE can post on there. I‚Äôm going to go ahead and put this out there; James has done NOTHING wrong in the slightest. In fact he‚Äôs done exactly what should‚Äôve been done a long time ago and I respect him for him regardless of him banning me. You deserved the ban just as much and Recoil and I, you caused much more fights than us. You always brought your negative attitude and beliefs to the table and you didn‚Äôt know when you stop, now you‚Äôre banned and it‚Äôs too late you‚Äôre complaining about not having access to the server. Recoil and I aren‚Äôt complaining, why do you have to? You brought this upon yourself, own up to your mistakes. Just because you‚Äôve donated doesn‚Äôt mean you deserve and special treatments please stop bring that up it makes you look even more immature. If you‚Äôre stupid enough to donate earned money to a Runescape Private Server, which mind you are illegal and could shut down or ban you at anytime, then you‚Äôre an idiot period.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm going to go ahead and apologise to the Moparscape community for the shitstorm that‚Äôs been drifted over here by Tennessee. I know he won‚Äôt swallow his pride and apologise so i‚Äôll apologise on the behalf of the victims in this instance.</p>
<p>Tennessee, just move on and let it go. Learn from this and don‚Äôt make the same mistakes if you can‚Äôt accept the consequences.</p>
