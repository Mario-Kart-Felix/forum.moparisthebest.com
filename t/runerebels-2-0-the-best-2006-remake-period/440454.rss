Welcome to RuneRebels!
RuneRebels is a very well-known private server whose sole purpose by its staff and development team is to replicate RuneScape exactly the way it was in the year 2006. We&#39;ve succeeded thus far with lots of help from previous staff and developers, as well as a handful of new developers we were lucky enough to stumble upon, and even a vast amount of the [u][b]MoparScape staff team[/b][/u]!

We have [b]three[/b] VPS&#39; running [b]three[/b] separate worlds: two [b]member[/b] worlds and one [b]non-member[/b] world. Our VPS&#39; all have [b][u]anti-DDoS protection[/u][/b] on them.
[b]Please also note that any members content is absolutely free and requires no payment for any of our members within our community.[/b]

[b][size=15pt]Members&#39; content has finally been released![/size][/b]

Thank you for the support! The game is actually still receiving updates to the engine and plugin architecture as I work on <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,673134.0.html" data-bbcode="true">Adventure Guild</a>, so we may see some new things on the developers side of things very soon! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>I’d also like to comment that if you want to start playing the game, the server is still online and will continue to be online, so don’t worry about losing your stats or items!</p>

              <p>Alright I think it’s time for me to input on this.</p>
<p>Tennessee, I don’t know why you keep insisting that I didn’t play the game. I played the game quite frequently. You’re also acting as if I, and others, had no right to be within the community. Even if Recoil, James and I didn’t play the game often we’re still entitled to posting on the Runerebels forums, It’s a public website. Meaning ANYONE can post on there. I’m going to go ahead and put this out there; James has done NOTHING wrong in the slightest. In fact he’s done exactly what should’ve been done a long time ago and I respect him for him regardless of him banning me. You deserved the ban just as much and Recoil and I, you caused much more fights than us. You always brought your negative attitude and beliefs to the table and you didn’t know when you stop, now you’re banned and it’s too late you’re complaining about not having access to the server. Recoil and I aren’t complaining, why do you have to? You brought this upon yourself, own up to your mistakes. Just because you’ve donated doesn’t mean you deserve and special treatments please stop bring that up it makes you look even more immature. If you’re stupid enough to donate earned money to a Runescape Private Server, which mind you are illegal and could shut down or ban you at anytime, then you’re an idiot period.</p>
<p>I’m going to go ahead and apologise to the Moparscape community for the shitstorm that’s been drifted over here by Tennessee. I know he won’t swallow his pride and apologise so i’ll apologise on the behalf of the victims in this instance.</p>
<p>Tennessee, just move on and let it go. Learn from this and don’t make the same mistakes if you can’t accept the consequences.</p>

<p>10/10 did not read your wall of text because it is a wall of text. Also, the frequency of getting on the computer has nothing to do with one’s ability to write without run-on paragraphs.

It may look bigger, but it is easier to take on multiple paragraphs and allow us to read it in chunks than for anyone to try such a mind-numbing task such as reading what you put.

<p>If you can’t understand how this matters, you will when you attempt to submit papers necessary for you to pass something in your life (Exams, state/country tests, career related papers, etc.).

<p>and all I have to say to you James is I was told by someone else you rolled the forums back and/or deleted my posts… I obviously can’t see the forums so there’s that. Secondly, posts WERE deleted by you because Ryan wasn’t even back from school and my posts were magically disappearing on the forums as witnessed by multiple players. I didn’t abuse or mistreat any staff. I’m sure you wont post what I said on the forums because it will show the exact post I made and disprove everything you’re saying. There’s a massive difference between mistreating/abusing and disagreeing… and that’s exactly what I did… I disagreed with you and you got pissed… bottom line.</p>
<p>If by treating you like a "police officer of the rune rebels world is the analogy you want to use, that’s fine, but police officers aren’t above the law… they are servants of the community… paid and in existence by the ones they police… Soo… that analogy sucks… because I donated and put money into your pocket but I’m told I can’t disagree with you… sounds about right…</p>
<p>and yea… sure ya banned elevate and recoil… your two buddies… you knew they weren’t playing RR so you said screw it and banned them from RR… big woop… they weren’t playing anyways… they hated it but came back 24/7 to stir up trouble… and yea I’m sure it was my email that was blocked considering I only played projectrs06 and signed up for 2006scape but never played… that makes total sense… I’m sure you didn’t have anything to do with that.</p>
<p>I don’t care I’m over it… it’s not like I’d play anymore anyways… I don’t want to support you or anybody else that’s ok with this decision…[/quote]</p>
<p>Elevate played. Recoil played. I actually cannot edit the blocked email list, it’s something only Ryan can mess with. Ryan gets on during class, it’s not like he’s in middle school or hischool. Don’t know why your email is on the blocked list, but it is. I didn’t make the police officer analogy, the rules were actually made by JT (former administrator) and approved by us. I’m not comparing myself to a police officer, or anything of that matter. I’m stating the rules. Also, we could ban you for whatever we wanted, even if it’s not justified.</p>
<p>You didn’t put any money in my pocket, you put money in Ryan’s pocket which in turn pays for the server. I’ve donated over $1000 to keep both RR and WS up (have the receipts to back that up) so the amount of money you donated does not help ME in the slightest, it helps the server. And trust me, I would post what you said on the forums, but I can’t, and you know that. Negative things were said by multiple people on that topic, which was why it was deleted.</p>
<p>And if you’re over it, go ahead and move on. We’ll do the same. There’s no need for you to post on our topics anymore.</p>

I disagree with that total purge. If someone is banned on the forums they obviously can’t “discuss it” there, and it’s not our job to censor any type of dissent with a server. I think the resulting flame fest should have been removed but discussing the way a server is run and saying the owners are making mistakes is not something we should remove. Not going to reverse John’s actions because the post was poorly written and was just going to cause a shitstorm, but if the parties involved want to continue the discussion properly it wont be removed.<br>

<p>Thank you very much. I’m completely IP banned from RR and worldscape so there isn’t anyway I can even talk to any of the other owners… James made it that way for a reason… He wanted to tell them “his side of the story” and not let me get mine out to anyone… and since he rolled the forums back on top of that there is absolutely no way for me to be heard. All I know is I’m extremely upset due to putting tons of time… effort… and money… into this game… I praised every single update that came out and VERY rarely said anything negative when there was a major lull and no content was being put out for months (which I feel like I’m entitled to anyways seeing that I was a donator)… I’ve never been apart of any “community” because I’m not that big of a gamer nor do I stay on the computer all the time… But I really enjoyed all the people in the community and we had a great one except for those 3 bad eggs that didn’t even play the game… they just came to ruin everyone’s fun so RR would be shut down and all the owners/devs focus would be on the game that they wanted… and it’s sad to say it was an owner… ex-dev… and a long time veteran… and for some reason that gives them special “privileges” to be jerks to everyone all the time… It wasn’t fair… and it still isn’t fair. If I could take this up with someone on RuneRebels like Ryan or Kevin specifically trust me I would… but this is my only outlet that I can be heard. It’s not right what was done and multiple people have stated that. I still don’t know if Ryan is aware of the situation or not… or Kevin either… but if they are then this is absolutely ridiculous that they can let 1 out of the 3 owners be this tyrannical and not have any checks and balances… this shows that 1 guy can just run away and do whatever he wants because somebody has a conflicting opinion and nobody will correct him in any way when the community is calling for it. Not to mention he has access to a lot of information and if he is willing to do something this childish and have this big of a power complex who’s to say he won’t run off with emails and passwords or something else crazy. If they want a legitimate server you can’t have a person like this as an owner and just give them the keys to do whatever they want… this is what happens… but I’m sure his goal was achieved seeing that multiple people have told me they are done with RuneRebels after this ordeal… He wanted to cause this drama and tear the server down not caring about the people who have donated and spent so much time getting high 80’s and 99’s on a 2x xp server and building friendships… it’s absolutely infuriating…[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m going to go ahead and squash this right here and now. (James from AllGoFree/RuneRebels/WorldScape).</p>
<p>First off, your “story” is irrelevant, chat logs speak for themselves which have been seen by all of the staff and owners. Second off, I didn’t “rollback” the forums (completely retarded for you to say that, there’s really no way to “rollback” the forums, we don’t back them up every 10 minutes or something ridiculous like that,) the topic was deleted BY RYAN for Spamming/Flaming, which is against the rules. What rule? Read this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spamming<br>
Please do not make any type of spam posts, or make topics out of their section on the forums. Spam posts include: Goodbye threads, threads about server status, flame threads, and anything else that doesn’t have a place on our forums.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thirdly, you also broke other rules (one that I disagree with, but it is a rule nonetheless) by threatening, attempting to manipulate, and attempting to intimidate a staff member. Here’s the rules for your consideration:</p>
<p>Forum Rule:<br>
4. Mistreating Staff.<br>
Please do not abuse or mistreat staff. Treat them as if they are ‘police officers’ of the RuneRebels world.</p>
<p>In-game rule:<br>
11. Disrespecting staff<br>
Please do not disrespect any member of the staff. The staff have a mute and ban option, and they will use it!</p>
<p>When did you break this rule? Well, I’d love to post the forum topic. But, since it has been deleted, I’ll go ahead and post this little tid-bit:</p>

<p>And in regards to being called “tyrannical” I’m lol’ing. I’ve been apart of AllGoFree for almost eight years now, and I can count on my hands how many people I’ve taken any account action on, and I’m extremely happy to add you to the list.</p>
<p>Now, go ahead and move on. You’re not getting unbanned, WE DON’T WANT YOU BACK. No offense to David, but he’s extremely wrong. What you are doing to our topic is neither wanted, nor warranted, and I’ll continue to report your posts on here until they’re removed, based on this rule right here:</p>
<p>Rule 12:<br>
We respect each other and other communities. We do not flame. There is to be no fighting on the forums.</p>
<p>John was doing his “job” (I hate calling it that, since it’s not like he gets paid) properly. Ryan would remove the posts himself, but he’s a shy guy and doesn’t want to be criticized for cleaning up his own topic. We don’t “want” this discussion to be continued. We want to be the adults here and walk away, unlike one individual.</p>
<p><em>EDIT</em></p>
<p>Also, you were not banned from Worldscape. Your account was flagged by our spam email detector, which we got off another RSPS. Apparently, this isn’t the first time you’ve gotten in trouble on an RSPS. Maybe you should move on from the community in general?</p>
<p><em>DOUBLEEDIT</em></p>
<p>And our other RSPS has nothing to do with wanting to get RuneRebels “shut down.” Yes, we’ve discussed shutting RR down over the past few weeks, but it definitely isn’t because of Worldscape. Why would we shut down a server with ~5 players on at a time to focus our staff on a really old server that only hardcore veterans of the server play? It makes no sense. Plus, I’m the lone developer of Worldscape for now, it doesn’t NEED staff, it’s dead too. ANNNND, you fail to mention that it was more than just YOU banned. Elevate and Recoil were also banned for flaming, and we’re going to have a no tolerance policy for it going forward.</p>
<p>In server news, Ryan and I have just completed the Halloween Event! It’s fun, everyone should try it out!</p>

Make it readable so people don’t just ignore it? Most people cant be assed to read a wall of text like that. At least learn how to use paragraphs.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I’ve never not read something due to a wall of text vs a paragraph. I’ve never understood how that mattered… if anything paragraph spacing makes it look longer than what it is… but again I’m not a forum guy and I don’t get on the computer much. I don’t know all the etiquette… sorry.[/quote]<br>
10/10 did not read your wall of text because it is a wall of text. Also, the frequency of getting on the computer has nothing to do with one’s ability to write without run-on paragraphs. Most countries attempt to teach students how to correctly write in their language of choosing, so even if English is not your first language you <span class="bbcode-b">should</span> know how to properly construct sentences and paragraphs in order to keep whatever you are writing coherent. It may look bigger, but it is easier to take on multiple paragraphs and allow us to read it in chunks than for anyone to try such a mind-numbing task such as reading what you put. The odds of anyone reading that are slim, and there is even less of a chance of retaining all of it when it looks like that.</p>
<p>If you can’t understand how this matters, you will when you attempt to submit papers necessary for you to pass something in your life (Exams, state/country tests, career related papers, etc.). I would suggest learning proper grammar, spelling, sentence structure, and everything else you’re missing.</p>
