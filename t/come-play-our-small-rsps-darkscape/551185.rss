What router do you have? The most I could give you is generalized instructions.</p>
<p>There are tools out there too… I used to use this one: <a href="http://simpleportforwarding.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://simpleportforwarding.com</a> back when I couldn’t portforward.<br>
What was strange was on my router, I’d do all the steps that tool did, and I still couldn’t connect. But when the tool did it, it allowed me to. I dunno. But my new router doesn’t have that issue.</p>
<p>Also <a href="http://portforward.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://portforward.com/</a> has guides for like every router in existence.</p>

I’ve had very few issues with it, actually. I’ve played Terraria multiplayer on it for 8-10 hours straight without many latency issues.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to use it then, it’s best just to get a small VPS, that way you yourself don’t have to host it and all you need to do is turn it on, get some form of auto restarter going, and then mostly forget about it.</p>

              <p>Essentially this system works best for OP just wanting to play with a few ‘friend’s’ to just mess around and have fun. I’ve done it before with friends of mine. Just gave everyone staff privileges and just pvp each other and pvm and what not out of bordem. However Hamachi is not a good idea here, just portforward it’ll make everyone’s lives easier. If you cannot open ports because your ISP or school or something is blocking them, well, you’re just outta luck. Have a friend host it or invest in a cheap vps for other uses than just this, they can be helpful in may ways, for many different kind of projects.</p>

<p>Sorry dude, you haven’t changed the client title. Your crowns are atrocious, the grammar is terrible, You have dark dagger as a godsword (Cammy PK Style), and nobody is gonna want to do hamachi.

<p>All good, i can see what you mean, Im not looking for serious players to come play on this, just anyone who would want to do some skilling or pking with my cousin and i for fun.</p>
<p>Also i haven’t changed it cause i couldn’t actually figure out how too x) and the dark dagger as the godsword is pretty funny, You can blame the original maker for that, and it doesnt seem like it, but im very confused, i tried running it instead with no - ip but the instructions i followed werent very specific and i couldnt get it to connect to my other computer, a matter of fact when i changed he network props to try and make a static IP (apparently i need one to use as the server ip i guess) and when i did that, it fucked up my internet connection LOL So hamachi is a no no for me now, the only reason why i used it was cause it was my only option that actually worked for me</p>
<p>i used utorrent to port forward before with the hamachi server but i also got told i cant do it with that so idk what to do haha.</p>
<p>if you would be willing to help in anyway id appreciate it, and yeah i get that, but i wasnt exactly targeting this towards anyone to make it popular or nothing, id just like to get maybe less than 5 people playing with us, however if i can learn to get the server running some other way and i learn how to improve on the client id maybe than id try to get alot of players.</p>
