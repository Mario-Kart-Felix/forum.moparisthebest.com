        <p>Season 7 was the seventh and final season of Medium. CBS renewed the show in May 2010, but they put the show in the 8:00pm Friday Night slot replacing Ghost Whisperer. The ratings began to fall so by mid-autumn, CBS had cut the episodes from a full 22 down to a mere 13 unfortunately. Ariel goes off to Dartmouth College this season and we see little of her, but more of Bridgette and Marie. Bridgette has more bigger roles this season, as compared to the last six seasons. Allison and Joe’s relationship begins to dwindle a bit this season as we learn the two aren’t seeing eye to eye on everything from work to the girls, to waking up to a “different” Allison every day. In Season Four’s Burn Baby Burn Parts 1 and 2 Allison tells Marjorie (Joe’s mother) that she will be fine, but the little white lie proved not true. Marjorie passes away from a brain tumor/cancer in Blood on the Tracks and she warns Allison about the darkness ahead of them. Lee Scanlon deals with his deceased brother for a few episodes and admits to Allison that he has let the woman kill him a few seasons back. Devalos decides to run for the Mayor and Allison and Joe both plan to enroll in school which has caused tension between them. Laura San Giacomo who played in the show Just Shoot Me guest stars as a murderer in the episode The People in Your Neighborhood. Allison’s half brother Michael comes back after a 3 season hiatus, this time played by Patricia’s real life brother David Arquette. The series ends on a bittersweet note. Joe gets killed in a plane crash on his way back from Hawaii, and we see how 7 years later, Allison has become the assistant DA, Devalos has become the Mayor, Marie as a 14-year-old teenager, while Bridgette is in college and not present in the episode. We also see a pregnant and married Ariel. While Allison is working on a trial, she seems to have visions of Joe actually surviving the crash but with amnesia. Allison makes a decision to find out where Joe is which sacrifices her own career and their lives in US. However, she ends up finding a startling truth! The series ends in 2060, which would be 41 years later as Allison is listening to her great grand child on a recording and she meets Joe as they both look like in the present. They share a passionate kiss which shows their love lasts<br>

Import from the Netherlands, which plays in English. Complete collection of the Gilmore Girls seasons 1-7 incl all extras. Set in a storybook Connecticut town populated with an eclectic mix of everyday folks and lovable lunatics, Gilmore Girls is a humorous multigenerational series about friendship, family and the ties that bind. Thirtysomething Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) has made her share of mistakes in life, but she has been doing her best to see that her college-bound daughter - and best friend in the world - Rory (Alexis Bledel), doesn’t follow in her footsteps. That may be easier said than done, considering that the two share the same interests, the same intellect, the same coffee addiction and the same eyes. Rory is more serious than Lorelai, but there are tendencies, especially in the love department, that clearly indicate she is her mother’s daughter. From the beginning, this unique mother-daughter team has been growing up together. Lorelai was just Rory’s age when she became pregnant and made the tough decision to raise her baby alone.</p>
