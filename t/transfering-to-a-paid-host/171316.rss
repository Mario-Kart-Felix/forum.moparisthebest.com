    <title>Transfering to a paid host</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/transfering-to-a-paid-host/171316</link>
    <description>I bought paid hosting today, and i changed the nameservers on my domain panel to it. Now i no it takes up to 72 hours. Heres my problem. On the paid host, i made my site the main one, and so i go to my old host, and i cannot delete the account. So will the site get redirected there after the name servers are propagated even though the other host still says they have me? wen i type in the site, i also get a basic page for hte host as i deletged everything from the ftp in a attempt  to rid of the account.</description>

if the nameserver is changed, it won’t.<br>

I changed the name servers to the new host. So will it ever get redirected to that account(work on that account) even though i am not able to delete my account from the old free host? or has i screwd this whole thing over?[/quote]</p>
<p>If the only thing the account on the old host was for was web hosting and not the domain, and the domain servers point to the new host, you should be fine.</p>
<p>If the domain still points to the old host, you’d have to change it, but other than that, it should be fine.</p>
