He kissed her, and outside the night birds sang as if everything were normal, quiet, and in its place.SIX «Halt here,» Captain Falcus shouted.Then realizing she’d spoken out of turn, she looked to Brennus.He was a scholar, not a warrior or battlemage, although his skills had saved her a few times in the past weeks.But he didn’t have the constitution or the training for this sort of forced march, and it was starting to show.<br>

There were about seven people in the square when they entered it, but within moments more began appearing from the houses.They didn’t look threatening; none of them even seemed to be armed.We mean you no harm.Then she whistled — one short, one long, two short.A few moments later Captain Falcus and the rest came down.</p>
