[center][size=12pt][u][b]Tutorial: How to Adapt to a 508 Server[/b][/u]
By: Davidi2[/size]
Added this here because it isn&#39;t exactly a tutorial, as Newty PM&#39;ed me about.[/center]

Many people now are switching from 317 servers to 508 and beyond. This switch is very large, and can take a long time to get used to. In a 317, almost everything you need to edit is in client.java, the main file for the server. When you first download a 508, you notice there is no client.java, or any main file at all. 508 servers use many different files all linked together in some way to run the server. This image should help you understand:[img]http://davidscape.com/508Chart.gif[/img]



As you can see, this is much more complicate then a 317. Now Ill walk you through some of the major things you might want to know about 508s:

[b]1. The Server and Engine[/b]
So what happens when you click run.bat? Its pretty amazing. A ripple effect of methods and classes all work in unison to create what we know as a private server, with the ability to accept connections and then display a character on the screen. But what players dont usually see is whats behind the scenes; whats running everything? The answer: [b]Server.java[/b]. This small java file puts everything together. It starts the engine, the socket listener(or connection manager) and many other individual files. It is also where banned users are usually found. Once it starts everything, the Server then hands the work over to the Engine. The Engine takes EVERY file in your server and puts them together, like putting different cogs into a machine. It starts the packet manager, file manager (for logging in ect), NPC, Players. Combat, everything. It also holds server-wide variables. Such as minigame timers and some shop data. The Engine relates to its Mopar counterpart, and runs everything.

[b]2. Packets: Commands, Clicking, and WHAT?![/b]
If you want to change something related to the client, such as clicking on things, or typing, you go to the packets folder. The packets folder is inside the io folder. In there are a bunch of files with pretty obvious names. 

[ul][li]ActionButtons - For clicking buttons on interfaces[/li]
[li]Commands - For typing commands and what they do[/li]
[li]ItemOperate - When you operate certain items[/li]
[li]PublicChat - What happens when someone talks[/li]
[li]Walking - What happens when someone walks[/li][/ul]

There are plenty of them, and they all relate to a packet sent to/from the client through the Stream (see below) in varying packet sizes. When the server picks up a packet, it sends it to the PacketManager, where it is identified and executed. For example, in PacketManager:
[code]case 222:  
[/code] 
Would indicate that the client send a packet of size 222, and to execute whatever packet 222 does. In this case, 222 is Public chatting. 
[code]case 222:

            /*
             * Public chatting.
             */
            publicChat.handlePacket(p, packetId, packetSize);
            break;[/code]
So the packet manager &quot;handles&quot; the 222 packet by executing the public chat method &quot;handlePacket.&quot;  The method handlePacket is in all of the different packet files, because it makes it easier to identify which packet is which. Here is the default layout of a packet:[code]

package SOURCENAME.io.packets;

import SOURCENAME.players.Player;

public class PACKETNAME implements Packet {

    /**
     * Default setup for all packets.
     * @param p The Player which the frame should be handled for.
     * @param packetId The packet id this belongs to.
     * @param packetSize The amount of bytes being recieved for this packet.
     */
    void handlePacket(Player p, int packetId, int packetSize);
//This is what the server should do when the packet is received. It could be to move, or to teleport, or almost anything.
}
[/code]

[b]3. World[/b]
Depending on your source, this folder may contain, but is not limited to: minigames, mapdata, items, grandexchangedata, and npcmovement. I will cover the ones that the typical Palidino base has, which are mapdata, items, and minigames.

[b]Mapdata[/b]
In a 317 server, the mapdata is stored in the cache and client, not in separate files. However, a typical MapData java file looks something like this: [code]package SOURCENAME.world.mapdata;


import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.File;
import SOURCENAME.util.Misc;


public class MapData {

    /**
     * Each list contains the region and 4 pieces of data.
     */
    public MapList[] mapLists = new MapList[2000];

    /**
     * Constructs a new MapData class.
     */
    public MapData() {
        loadMapAreaData();
    }

    /**
     * Load the map data into memory for faster load time.
     */
    public void loadMapAreaData() {
        int curId = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 16000; i++) {
if ((i != 12351) &amp;&amp; (i != 12352)){
            try {
                File file = new File(&quot;./data/mapdata/&quot; + i + &quot;.txt&quot;);

                if (file.exists()) {
                    MapList list = mapLists[curId++] = new MapList();
                    BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(
                            new FileReader(&quot;./data/mapdata/&quot; + i + &quot;.txt&quot;));
                    String str;
                    int regionId = 0;

                    list.region = i;
                    while ((str = in.readLine()) != null) {
                        if (!str.equals(&quot;&quot;)) {
                            list.data[regionId++] = Integer.parseInt(str.trim());
                        }
                    }
                    in.close();
                    in = null;
                }
                file = null;
            } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

    /**
     * Returns the four pieces of map data from a region.
     * @param myRegion The region to get data from.
     * @return Returns the four mapdata.
     */
    public int[] getData(int myRegion) {
        for (MapList list : mapLists) {
            if (list == null) {
                continue;
            }
            if (list.region == myRegion) {
                return list.data;
            }
        }
        Misc.println(&quot;Missing map data: &quot; + myRegion);
        return new int[4];
    }
}
[/code]
As you can see, this loads each map region separately, and stores it into an array. This provides limitations to 508 servers, as there are certain places that cannot be visited without the correct mapdata. If you are playing your server and your screen goes white, chances are you are missing mapdata.

[b]Items[/b]
The items folder [i]usually[/i] contains the following java files: GroundItem, ItemList, and Items. The ground item file handles, you guessed it, ground items. These are items that are dropped, by NPCs, Players, or just created, such as a party room putting items on the floor.  The code for a ground item is: [code]public GroundItem(int _index, int id, int amt, int x, int y, int h, String owner) {
        index = _index;
        itemId = id;
        itemAmt = amt;
        itemX = x;
        itemY = y;
        itemHeight = h;
        itemDroppedBy = owner;
    }[/code]
Each variable is fairly obvious, but Ill explain a few of them. Index is which ground item we are talking about. Such as in an array, if we want to talk about the second value of the array we say: [code]System.out.println(&quot;&quot; + ourArray[1]);[/code] 
The item dropped by variable stores who can see the drop. For example, you could say David and only the user David could see the drop. Setting the value to &quot;&quot; makes it so everyone can see it.

The item list file stores each item in its own array, one of the few things a 317 and 508 have in common. Its fairly simple and doesn&#39;t need much explaining.

The main item file is the main file for handling all items in the game. It stores all of the item methods, such as: [code]getDiscription(int itemId)[/code]
and puts the other item files together.

[b]Minigame[/b]
This is one of the least important of all your folders. In it are the files for your minigames, depending on your source. The normal and most common is bountyHunter. It is for leaving and entering the craters, and setting skulls ect. Not much to do here but make and edit minigames.

<p>Many people now are switching from 317 servers to 508 and beyond. This switch is very large, and can take a long time to get used to. In a 317, almost everything you need to edit is in client.java, the main file for the server. When you first download a 508, you notice there is no client.java, or any main file at all. 508 servers use many different files all linked together in some way to run the server. This image should help you understand:<img src="http://davidscape.com/508Chart.gif" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>As you can see, this is much more complicate then a 317. Now Ill walk you through some of the major things you might want to know about 508s:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">1. The Server and Engine</span><br>
So what happens when you click run.bat? Its pretty amazing. A ripple effect of methods and classes all work in unison to create what we know as a private server, with the ability to accept connections and then display a character on the screen. But what players dont usually see is whats behind the scenes; whats running everything? The answer: <span class="bbcode-b">Server.java</span>. This small java file puts everything together. It starts the engine, the socket listener(or connection manager) and many other individual files. It is also where banned users are usually found. Once it starts everything, the Server then hands the work over to the Engine. The Engine takes EVERY file in your server and puts them together, like putting different cogs into a machine. It starts the packet manager, file manager (for logging in ect), NPC, Players. Combat, everything. It also holds server-wide variables. Such as minigame timers and some shop data. The Engine relates to its Mopar counterpart, and runs everything.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">2. Packets: Commands, Clicking, and WHAT?!</span><br>
If you want to change something related to the client, such as clicking on things, or typing, you go to the packets folder. The packets folder is inside the io folder. In there are a bunch of files with pretty obvious names.</p>
<p>[ul][li]ActionButtons - For clicking buttons on interfaces[/li]<br>
[li]Commands - For typing commands and what they do[/li]<br>
[li]ItemOperate - When you operate certain items[/li]<br>
[li]PublicChat - What happens when someone talks[/li]<br>
[li]Walking - What happens when someone walks[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>There are plenty of them, and they all relate to a packet sent to/from the client through the Stream (see below) in varying packet sizes. When the server picks up a packet, it sends it to the PacketManager, where it is identified and executed. For example, in PacketManager:</p>
<p><code>case 222:  
</code><br>
Would indicate that the client send a packet of size 222, and to execute whatever packet 222 does. In this case, 222 is Public chatting.</p>
<p>[code]case 222:</p>
<pre><code>        /*
         * Public chatting.
         */
        publicChat.handlePacket(p, packetId, packetSize);
        break;[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>So the packet manager “handles” the 222 packet by executing the public chat method “handlePacket.”  The method handlePacket is in all of the different packet files, because it makes it easier to identify which packet is which. Here is the default layout of a packet:[code]</p>
<p>package SOURCENAME.io.packets;</p>
<p>import SOURCENAME.players.Player;</p>
<p>public class PACKETNAME implements Packet {</p>
<pre><code>/**
 * Default setup for all packets.
 * @param p The Player which the frame should be handled for.
 * @param packetId The packet id this belongs to.
 * @param packetSize The amount of bytes being recieved for this packet.
 */
void handlePacket(Player p, int packetId, int packetSize);
</code></pre>
<p>//This is what the server should do when the packet is received. It could be to move, or to teleport, or almost anything.<br>
}<br>
[/code]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">3. World</span><br>
Depending on your source, this folder may contain, but is not limited to: minigames, mapdata, items, grandexchangedata, and npcmovement. I will cover the ones that the typical Palidino base has, which are mapdata, items, and minigames.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Mapdata</span><br>
In a 317 server, the mapdata is stored in the cache and client, not in separate files. However, a typical MapData java file looks something like this: [code]package SOURCENAME.world.mapdata;</p>
<p>import java.io.BufferedReader;<br>
import java.io.FileReader;<br>
import java.io.File;<br>
import SOURCENAME.util.Misc;</p>
<p>public class MapData {</p>
<pre><code>/**
 * Each list contains the region and 4 pieces of data.
 */
public MapList[] mapLists = new MapList[2000];

/**
 * Constructs a new MapData class.
 */
public MapData() {
    loadMapAreaData();
}

/**
 * Load the map data into memory for faster load time.
 */
public void loadMapAreaData() {
    int curId = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 16000; i++) {
</code></pre>
<p>if ((i != 12351) &amp;&amp; (i != 12352)){<br>
try {<br>
File file = new File("./data/mapdata/" + i + “.txt”);</p>
<pre><code>            if (file.exists()) {
                MapList list = mapLists[curId++] = new MapList();
                BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(
                        new FileReader("./data/mapdata/" + i + ".txt"));
                String str;
                int regionId = 0;

                list.region = i;
                while ((str = in.readLine()) != null) {
                    if (!str.equals("")) {
                        list.data[regionId++] = Integer.parseInt(str.trim());
                    }
                }
                in.close();
                in = null;
            }
            file = null;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<pre><code>/**
 * Returns the four pieces of map data from a region.
 * @param myRegion The region to get data from.
 * @return Returns the four mapdata.
 */
public int[] getData(int myRegion) {
    for (MapList list : mapLists) {
        if (list == null) {
            continue;
        }
        if (list.region == myRegion) {
            return list.data;
        }
    }
    Misc.println("Missing map data: " + myRegion);
    return new int[4];
}
</code></pre>
<p>}<br>
[/code]<br>
As you can see, this loads each map region separately, and stores it into an array. This provides limitations to 508 servers, as there are certain places that cannot be visited without the correct mapdata. If you are playing your server and your screen goes white, chances are you are missing mapdata.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Items</span><br>
The items folder <span class="bbcode-i">usually</span> contains the following java files: GroundItem, ItemList, and Items. The ground item file handles, you guessed it, ground items. These are items that are dropped, by NPCs, Players, or just created, such as a party room putting items on the floor.  The code for a ground item is: <code>public GroundItem(int _index, int id, int amt, int x, int y, int h, String owner) {
        index = _index;
        itemId = id;
        itemAmt = amt;
        itemX = x;
        itemY = y;
        itemHeight = h;
        itemDroppedBy = owner;
    }</code><br>
Each variable is fairly obvious, but Ill explain a few of them. Index is which ground item we are talking about. Such as in an array, if we want to talk about the second value of the array we say: <code>System.out.println("" + ourArray[1]);</code><br>
The item dropped by variable stores who can see the drop. For example, you could say David and only the user David could see the drop. Setting the value to “” makes it so everyone can see it.</p>
<p>The item list file stores each item in its own array, one of the few things a 317 and 508 have in common. Its fairly simple and doesn’t need much explaining.</p>
<p>The main item file is the main file for handling all items in the game. It stores all of the item methods, such as: <code>getDiscription(int itemId)</code><br>
and puts the other item files together.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Minigame</span><br>
This is one of the least important of all your folders. In it are the files for your minigames, depending on your source. The normal and most common is bountyHunter. It is for leaving and entering the craters, and setting skulls ect. Not much to do here but make and edit minigames.</p>
