    <description>[B][U]== What does it do? ==[/U][/B]
The Runescape update server is a quick and effective way of transferring updated files to the runescape cache. It works by checking the crc, and version numbers in each of the client&#39;s cache files against that of the server. Any files that don&#39;t match are then sent to the client to be packed into the cache.

[U][B]== How does it work? ==[/B][/U]
An update session is first initialized by the client. The client creates a connection to the server on port 43594 (The same location and port as the Game Server). The client will then begin checking the checksum of its own files against that of the server. This is done by using the pre-sent &#39;versionlist.jag&#39; file, which is sent before any updating is performed, Via a different protocol. This protocol is commonly referred to as JAGGRAB. See my JAGGRAB protocol docs here: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,385793.0.html

Any file checksums that don&#39;t match then must be requested from the server in the form of a 4 byte message, containing the cache, file id, and priority of the request (See Request Priority below). The server will then respond to the request with numerous &#39;chunk&#39; messages, containing a 6 byte header, and up to 500 bytes of the file requested. Once a sucessful transfer has occurred, the client must then reassemble the different chunks, and pack the file into its cache.

[U][B]== Request Priority ==[/B][/U]
Each request comes with a 1 of 3 different priority levels, these values define the urgency of the request.
The different priorities are as follows:
URGENT - This priority occurs when the client is in game, and requires a new model that it has not yet recieved.
LOADUP - This priority is only used when the client is loading
PASSIVE - This priority is used when a file is not needed urgently, but will probably be needed in the future.
Requests should be processed according to their priority, LOADUP being the highest, PASSIVE being the lowest.

[U][B]== File request format ==[/B][/U]
File requests from the client come in the form of a short, 4 byte message. The format is as follows:
[code]
·cache_id:byte    The id of the cache the file is found in
.file_id:short        The id of the file inside the cache to update
.priority:byte       The priority of the request (See Request Priorities above)
[/code]

[U][B]== File response format ==[/B][/U]
Responses to a File Request message broken up in to a number of chunks. The amount of chunks the server will respond with depends on the size of the file. The file is broken up into 500 byte chunks, which are each prefixed by a 6 byte header. A chunk can also contain less than 500 bytes, if needed (ie. the end of the file). The header contains information about the file the chunk pertains to, and the chunks location in the file.
The format for an entire chunk is as follows:
[code]
.cache_id:byte     The id of the cache the file is found in
.file_id:short        The id of the file inside the cache to update
.file_size:short     The entire file size of the file we&#39;re updating
.chunk_id:byte     The id of this chunk. Chunk ids increment with each new chunk of a file sent.
.data:max. 500 bytes    The data
[/code]

[U][B]== Example Request and Response ==[/B][/U]
The following is an example of a request for a new file, and the server&#39;s response

[code]
Client Write: 
[Request] Cache id 1; File id 1; Priority 2

Server Write:
[Chunk] Cache id 1; File id 1; File size 1128; Chunk id 0; [500 bytes of data]
[Chunk] Cache id 1; File id 1; File size 1128; Chunk id 1; [500 bytes of data]
[Chunk] Cache id 1; File id 1; File size 1128; Chunk id 2; [128 bytes of data]
[/code]

Anyways, I read this part much too quickly and only saw the words "runescape", "quick and effective", "transferring", and "files" and got the idea that you could transfer RSPS items to real RS. :O
<p>Gl on this though, sounds really cool!</p>
