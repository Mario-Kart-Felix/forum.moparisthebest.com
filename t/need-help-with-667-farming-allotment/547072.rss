    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-667-farming-allotment/547072</link>
    <description>I want to be able to farm allotment to get farming xp. Just allotment that you get xp from after raking, it never goes away. that stuff. I need to know how to add this, whenever i try to rake it, it says &quot;nothing interesting happens&quot;. I also tried using the rake on the allotment but to no avail. the model of the allotment i wanna rake is object 8553. If you have played oldscape 742 you know what im talking about. And BTW ik its in the objecthandler.java i think at least. i just dont know what to add. thank you!!

Thank youuuu</description>

              <p>I don’t play that new rs garbage so I have no idea what an allotment is, but seeing that you have gotten no help here(since mopar is dead) I will try to assist you. Assuming allotment is an object you can look for a file that handles itemonobject and set the rake id to be used with the allotment and give you xp just like any other skill would give you. If you do not know how to make it give you xp then look at a file where it gives the player xp for doing something.</p>
