About Macs 

The Macintosh Operating System 
is the most user-friendly software commercially available. 
How can I make this claim? Personal experience. The Windows OS may 
seem easy to use at first, BUT as you use it more and more you’ll 
find it&#39;s a whole lot more complicated than it appears! Windows gets 
bugs. Patches are constantly being released and are often large files 
you need to download. Windows gets viruses. You need to buy expensive 
programs to protect your computer, as well as run frequent scans that 
take up a great deal of memory. 



Frequent Problems and how to fix them 

This is a RuneScape forum so people will be reading 
this for help with their RuneScape-related problems on a Mac. 
Here are some of the very, VERY few issues that may be encountered. 

1. When loading a page on the RuneScape website, you may encounter a 
totally white screen. Click anywhere on this white space and the page 
will appear. Fairly straightforward. 
2. When loading the RuneScape game, you may get a white box with a 
little red X on a document symbol in the top left of the box. This is 
a failed classloader (if you care enough you can find out the exact 
string in the Java console) and can be fixed by closing Safari and 
reopening it with the default settings. Again, very simple. 
3. While playing the game, you may suddenly notice that your character 
and everything else simply stops moving and you can’t click anything. 
EDIT: Jordanweb has a great solution to this problem on page 3 

4. When playing with music on (the RS music) you may notice it 
suddenly just holds a random note, which can get very annoying. 
Follow the instructions given by Jordanweb on page 3  


The Macintosh OS doesn’t have bugs. And if a small issue with the 
software is ever reported, Apple will release a patch (this is rare). 
Also, Macs don’t get fragmented and are immune to approximately 
100,000 identified viruses. Macintosh laptops pick up a wireless 
internet signal anywhere there is one, right out of the box. Plus 
there is no setup of hardware to use a Mac . Any questions about the 
information above can be asked later.

Other Information 

Playing RuneScape on a Mac is very straightforward, and quite easy. 
However, do not go PKing with a one-button mouse. That’s the one and 
only drawback, sorry. Oh, wait. I forgot-Macs can support a two-button 
USB mouse! Touché, PC . Also, remember that if your in-game settings 
(the wrench icon) are set to a two button mouse when you really only 
have one button, all your clicks will be the equivalent of a left 
click. When set to one button, you will click something once and it 
will be like right clicking with a PC. 

EDIT--Helpful tip from Lumberslashe--Pressing the Apple(Command) 
key and clicking is like right clicking. Thanks a lot, I didn&#39;t know 
that  

If I find something else to add, I&#39;ll add it later.


Frequently asked questions 

Q-What browser should I use to play on my Mac? 
A-Safari is a fine browser. It even supports tabbed browsing, 
a helpful feature. 

Q-How do I remove cookies in Safari? 
A-Go to the Safari menu, click Prederences, and then click the 
Security tab. Click Show Cookies and then click Remove all. 

Q-Is there an Official Mac client I can get from the RuneScape 
website? 
A-No, not at the moment. Safari is fine. 

Q-Can I download stuff while playing RuneScape on my Mac, or will it 
make me lag? 
A-Yes you can. Download music, movies, whatever, and you will 
experience no lag. 
Disclaimer-Always download stuff LEGALLY. If it’s free, don’t trust 
it. 

Q-Don’t I have to download Java? 
A-Nope. Macs come with Java preinstalled. No need to download 
anything in order to run RuneScape. 

Q-The RuneScape music doesn’t work on my PC. Will I have to configure 
anything to make it work on my Mac? 
A-No again . The music and sound effects should work with no problems. 

Q-Can my Mac get keylogged? 
A-Technically yes, it is possible. But as Macs will automatically 
detect any file that even had the remote possibility of being 
dangerous, you’re chances of getting a keylogger or a virus on a 
Mac is extremely slim. 

Q-What about Spyware? 
A-See previous answer!  

Q-Yay, I just got a fire cape! How do I take a screenshot of it? 
A-Make sure you can see the fire cape, and then press Command-Shift-4.
 This will make your cursor turn into a crosshairs. Highlight the area 
you want to take a picture of and release the mouse button. The picture
 will automatically pop up on your desktop as a PNG image. 

EDIT--please be aware that if you want your question answered, 
make a new thread as help threads aren&#39;t allowed on the forums. 

If you have a solution to a problem you&#39;d like me to include, please 
post that!
