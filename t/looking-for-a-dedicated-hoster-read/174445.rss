    <description>Hey, A few days ago me and a few other friends were on my server, one of them was Jonny J from WildyScape.  Jonny has gotten tired of WildyScape, Myself, Sean ( Mod H4x ), Jonny J, Elite have decided to make a massive server bigger than google, WildyScape and other huge servers.  For this reason we are seeking a Dedicated Server hoster  Please add me on Msn da_dragon101@hotmail.com.
We have not thought of a name yet so please, people brainstorm ideas 
Thank-you Ipknoobsi

<li>GET A JOB</li>

<p>earn your own cash and buying a VPS yourself -.-</p>
