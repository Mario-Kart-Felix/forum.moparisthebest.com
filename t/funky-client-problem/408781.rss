    <title>Funky Client Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/funky-client-problem/408781</link>
    <description>Ok, iv narrowed my problem down to this. I extracted a fresh copy of &quot;web client ready.rar&quot; from the source HybridPvP V3. And I extracted it and all I did was creat a jar of it. I dident edit anything, or compie anything. Now I took that jar and tried it on 3 different computers. Mine and it worked, another with windows xp and it worked, and finally 1 with windows 7 and it worked. Then since all 3 tests worked I DID NOT EDIT ANYTING, I just opened the source of the client and compiled. I got no errors what soever, and remember I DID NOT EDIT ANYTHING i just compiled for the hell of it. evything worked. Then when I went to test on all 3 computers again. It worked on mine, but on the other 2 I got this error while running the client.jar. &quot;Could not find the main class: client&quot; Program will now close. What the hell is going on.</description>
