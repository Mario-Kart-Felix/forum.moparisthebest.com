    <description>What is the required/minimum amount of...

Bandwith
Diskspace
Ram
Virtual Processors
IP

To run a server on a VPS, because I don&#39;t want to host one with shitty features, and barely hold anyone on it. I just want something descent, and I&#39;d like the much more experienced to reply. The reason I&#39;m asking is only because I&#39;ve hosted servers on my computer, but I stopped due to paying for bandwith anyways to my ISP. I&#39;d rather get a VPS just for my RSPS, and just leave it for that purpose only. 

I&#39;d also like to know what VPS&#39;s that you use for the time being, or you&#39;d use in the future. Most reliable, trustworthy, and efficient. 

A little help please?</description>
