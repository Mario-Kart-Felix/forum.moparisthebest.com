<p>Why would a tuition fee rise mean that it costs more for general living?</p>
<p>I don’t really mind these rise in tuition fees, UK citizens already have quite good tuition fees, and the only thing that’ll happen is you’ll come out with more debt. But it isn’t a bad debt, it isn’t hard to pay off, you only start paying it off (in small monthly payments) once you start earning £21k or more, and it is written off after 25 years if it hasn’t been paid off.</p>
<p>University should be seen as an investment in your career, one that will help you earn more money. If you’re smart about the choices you make at University, then that debt is worth it. If you’re not, then you only have yourself to blame.<br>
[/quote]I see it differently. The least the government can do is pay for all your education, since you’ll make them a shitload of money in tax for the rest of your life.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Who pays for the professors?<br>
[/quote]Everyone does, it’s called tax.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ah, so now universities will become as shitty as public schools. Makes sense.<br>
[/quote]Except not. I guess you can ask zstars about it for an objective view, since he went to some swedish uni last summer (2 months or something).[/quote]<br>
Pretty sure tuition pays the professors and the university all together.  I doubt it could afford that and start running government ran universities which will turn into public school like.</p>

<p>I don’t agree with this. I wouldn’t say I’m from a poor background, but more I don’t ask for financial support from my parents. I’m given a £400 allowance each term from my dad, which usually goes toward drink/food.</p>
<p>I’m paying £3,290 a year for my tuition fee, and then £3500 a year for my student accomodation. This is all paid for through the student finance system, and by the end of my 3 year degree, I should be £23,000 in debt. Now, assuming that tuition fees do rise to £6,000 a year tuition, absolutely anyone, poor or rich, will be able to finance this through a student loan which, under the new government guidelines, will be provided extremely generously. Not only this, but depending on which course you apply for, student can recieve grants, which don’t have to be paid back. For example, this year alone, my Computer Science course will have given me £1200 and the government will have given me £2906 in grants.</p>
<p>I think the way we pay for higher education here is very good, and I’m not against the rise in tuition fees at all. A rise should surely mean a higher quality of education, a more generous way to pay for the debt associated with higher education, and surely more would be attracted to higher education because of the generousity of the loan.</p>
<p>Debt is something that most people will have to take in order to reiece degrees, masters and PhDs here, and I think the debt is totally worth it. I completely agree with Thug Life’s post about being provided with an opportunity to further your career as a result of uni.</p>

<p>Why would a tuition fee rise mean that it costs more for general living?</p>
<p>I don’t really mind these rise in tuition fees, UK citizens already have quite good tuition fees, and the only thing that’ll happen is you’ll come out with more debt.

Students make bad consumers because there is an information asymmetry. The educators are always more intelligent and more knowledgeable than the educated. You can see students moaning about low contact hours and they completely miss the point.</p>
<p>Education is not about filling the bucket, but lighting the fire. Turning students into consumers royally fucks this up.</p>

<p>No, we have the shitty comprehensives where nobody learns anything :P[/quote]</p>
<p>Actually you have some good comprehensive schools, its just the house prices in their catchment area are driven up by middle-class people buying them. So these kids go to that school, their parents have loads of time to help them, the school gets even better and houses prices rise even more. Positive feedback cycle. Of course all the poor people whose parents work long hours all day have to go to the school in the poor area and that school becomes shit.</p>
<p>Long story short. Roll back Thatcher’s league tables, its a classic example of the free market fucking things up for most people.</p>
<p>I know what’s going to happen now. Someone is going to claim that actually rich people work longer hours than poor people. It makes intuitive sense because longer hours generally means more salary. Except this view isn’t backed up by the evidence. Intuition doesn’t have to be correct.</p>
