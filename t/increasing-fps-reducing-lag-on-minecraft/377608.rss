    <title>Increasing FPS, reducing lag on Minecraft</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/increasing-fps-reducing-lag-on-minecraft/377608</link>
    <description>Considering it&#39;s not my tutorial, but I think it&#39;ll help some people if they take a look at this topic in its entirety.
http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=26219

Or people who don&#39;t wanna find the link, look below.

&lt;blockquote&gt;[size=100][b]I am working on an update to this guide, including, but not limited to: New links to other helpful/useful programs, links to possibly helpful mods for Beta, a compete rewording of the guide in an attempt to shrink the overall size of the guide, and much more! However, it may take awhile due to me returning to college in a few days. Be patient!

Please note, if you have read this guide and any of the pages of the thread, and you feel the need to post some rude comment such as &quot;I think this guide should be de-stickied because it&#39;s useless&quot;, I will report your post.[/b][/size]

[b]Alright, I&#39;ve been watching from the sidelines, and I&#39;ve seen many many people having trouble with Alpha, and how they aren&#39;t getting a whole lot of FPS while playing, which in turn means very choppy gameplay. So I decided to join up and write this guide.[/b]

[i]If you&#39;re wondering why I put each step description in quotes, I personally find that it makes this guide alot easier to read, and it also makes this guide not look like a giant wall of text.[/i]

[b][u]Programs you will need[/u][/b]
1. [b][url=http://www.iobit.com/gamebooster.html]Game Booster[/url][/b] from IOBit
2. [b][url=http://www.iobit.com/advancedwindowscareper.html]Advanced SystemCare[/url][/b] from IOBit [i](If I remember correctly, I believe Game Booster asks you if you want to download this)[/i]

[b]Step 1: The Setup[/b]
[quote]Alright, let&#39;s begin by downloading Game Booster and Advanced SystemCare. Once these are downloaded and installed, you&#39;re gonna want to run Disk Defragmenter, which can be accessed by clicking &quot;Start&quot; [i](or the Windows logo on your taskbar)[/i] then navigating to All Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; System Tools -&gt; Disk Defragmenter. This is just preparation for Advanced SystemCare. Let Disk Defrag do it&#39;s job, which can take from several minutes to several hours. However, it is necessary if you want to get better performance from your computer.

Once Disk Defrag has finished, run Advanced SystemCare. You&#39;ll notice it tells you about upgrading to the Professional Edition [i](by buying a license)[/i] which in turn makes this program delve deeper into your registry and what-not, to fix alot more errors then it would if you didn&#39;t upgrade. I do not advocate piracy in any way, but obviously, if you search enough, you can find a license key if you&#39;re really that desperate to get the full version.

Once you&#39;ve gotten that set up, look at the top right corner of the program. See the word &quot;Restore&quot;? Click that, and on the popup that appears, click &quot;Create a restore point&quot;. This is just incase something goes wrong, and I assure you, nothing will go wrong.

Once that&#39;s done, click the big &quot;Care!&quot; button. If a popup appears, just close it, and click the Care button again. Advanced SystemCare will begin scanning your computer, and doing the following:

- [b]Spyware Removal[/b] [i](Scan and remove spyware, adware)[/i]
- [b]Registry Fix[/b] [i](Cleanup registry to improve performance)[/i]
- [b]Privacy Sweep[/b] [i](Erase your activity history and surfing traces. This basically clears your History on IE, FireFox, etc)[/i]
- [b]Junk Files Clean[/b] [i](Clean up junk files and recover disk space)[/i]

Once Advanced SystemCare is done doing it&#39;s thing, you can close it.[/quote]

[b]Step 2: Power Options [i](Laptop only, I believe)[/i][/b]
[quote]Power Options is where many peoples choppiness in Minecraft comes from while playing on a laptop. Navigate to your taskbar, and to the left of your Volume icon, you should see what looks like the white outline of a battery [i](and when your laptop is plugged in, it&#39;ll have a plug beside the battery icon)[/i]. Right-click that icon and click &quot;Power Options&quot;.

On the screen that pops up, you should see 3 selectable options; &quot;Balanced&quot;, &quot;Power Saver&quot; and &quot;High Performance&quot;. Select High Performance. High Performance mode drains the laptops battery faster than Balanced and Power Saver, but it increases the performance of your computer, and of course, your games. Obviously, the faster drain in battery power doesn&#39;t matter if your laptop is always plugged in. I found Minecraft to be very choppy when I had my power option set to &quot;Power Saver&quot;.[/quote]
 
[b]Step 3: Game Booster[/b]
[quote]Game Booster is freeware, luckily, and essentially what it does is shuts down various processes running in the background to improve your computers performance and help your games run faster. Shutting down various processes in the background is not something that you should attempt manually via hitting CTRL+ALT+DEL, because you could potentially mess something up.

Run Game Booster, and click &quot;Switch to Gaming Mode&quot;. The program will then stop all unnecessary background processes that tend to eat up RAM. Upon switching to Gaming Mode, I gained about 149MB of RAM. Not too shabby :)

As well, switching to Gaming Mode disables the fancy Aero theme and switches to a plain, non-fancy, no visual styles, non-transparent basic Vista theme. Don&#39;t worry. To switch back to normal mode, click the icon on your taskbar that looks like the Game Booster logo and click Switch to Normal Mode.[/quote]

[b]Step 4: Other Things[/b]
[quote]Now that you&#39;ve successfully ran Disk Defragmenter, Advanced SystemCare, switched to High Performance [i](laptops only I believe)[/i], and switched to Gaming Mode with Game Booster, if you want to further increase performance, close any programs you have running such as Windows Live Messenger/MSN/Yahoo Messenger/AIM/etc, any P2P programs like uTorrent/Limewire/Kazaa/etc, iTunes, and whatever else might be eating up RAM. Updating your video card drivers often helps with performance as well.

If you&#39;re really desperate for FPS, while playing Minecraft, go to the Options and set View Distance to Tiny, and switch graphics from &quot;Fancy&quot; to &quot;Fast&quot;.[/quote]

[b]The Results![/b]
[quote]Now, assuming you&#39;ve followed my entire guide from start to finish, you should notice a huge increase in FPS. I ran my own tests, and here&#39;s what I got for FPS.

I&#39;m running on an HP G60 Notebook PC, nVidia GeForce 8200M G video card, 3GB of RAM, AMD Athlon Dual-Core QL-60 [i](1.90GHz)[/i] processor, on Windows Vista Home Premium (32-bit), and a Windows Experience Index rating of 3.5.

Running Minecraft Alpha [i](single player)[/i] in Gaming Mode [i](from Game Booster)[/i], with MSN shut down, here&#39;s my FPS:

[b]Far view distance/Fast graphics:[/b] 25 to 30 FPS
[b]Normal view distance/Fast graphics:[/b] 45 to 52 FPS
[b]Short view distance/Fast graphics:[/b] 60 to 73 FPS
[b]Tiny view distance/Fast graphics:[/b] 79 to 91 FPS [i](Update on this result, I just recently played Alpha again and managed to hit 101 FPS under Tiny view distance and fast graphics)[/i]

To do the tests, I turned off fog, stood still in one area and waited until the chunk updates stopped, then watched my FPS. I recorded the lowest FPS I got, and then recorded the FPS as it changed, until I got the highest amount of FPS. I did the same thing for all 4 view distance settings. I didn&#39;t test my FPS with Fancy Graphics though, as it was late, and I was tired.[/quote]

[b]I hope this guide helps you get better performance from your PC! If you have any questions, don&#39;t be afraid to ask. I&#39;m not exactly a genius at this stuff, but a friend of mine recommended Game Booster and Advanced SystemCare and basically told me how to get my PC running to the best of its ability.[/b]&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

I have way too much shit. It takes like 3 minutes to load where I can use google chrome. But when I boot into xubuntu on the laptop I hardly have any fps lag.</p>

<blockquote>[size=100][b]I am working on an update to this guide, including, but not limited to: New links to other helpful/useful programs, links to possibly helpful mods for Beta, a compete rewording of the guide in an attempt to shrink the overall size of the guide, and much more! However, it may take awhile due to me returning to college in a few days. Be patient!
<p>Please note, if you have read this guide and any of the pages of the thread, and you feel the need to post some rude comment such as “I think this guide should be de-stickied because it’s useless”, I will report your post.[/b][/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Alright, I’ve been watching from the sidelines, and I’ve seen many many people having trouble with Alpha, and how they aren’t getting a whole lot of FPS while playing, which in turn means very choppy gameplay. So I decided to join up and write this guide.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">If you’re wondering why I put each step description in quotes, I personally find that it makes this guide alot easier to read, and it also makes this guide not look like a giant wall of text.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Programs you will need</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="http://www.iobit.com/gamebooster.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Game Booster</a></span> from IOBit</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="http://www.iobit.com/advancedwindowscareper.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Advanced SystemCare</a></span> from IOBit <span class="bbcode-i">(If I remember correctly, I believe Game Booster asks you if you want to download this)</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 1: The Setup</span></p>
<p>[quote]Alright, let’s begin by downloading Game Booster and Advanced SystemCare. Once these are downloaded and installed, you’re gonna want to run Disk Defragmenter, which can be accessed by clicking “Start” <span class="bbcode-i">(or the Windows logo on your taskbar)</span> then navigating to All Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; System Tools -&gt; Disk Defragmenter. This is just preparation for Advanced SystemCare. Let Disk Defrag do it’s job, which can take from several minutes to several hours. However, it is necessary if you want to get better performance from your computer.</p>
<p>Once Disk Defrag has finished, run Advanced SystemCare. You’ll notice it tells you about upgrading to the Professional Edition <span class="bbcode-i">(by buying a license)</span> which in turn makes this program delve deeper into your registry and what-not, to fix alot more errors then it would if you didn’t upgrade. I do not advocate piracy in any way, but obviously, if you search enough, you can find a license key if you’re really that desperate to get the full version.</p>
<p>Once you’ve gotten that set up, look at the top right corner of the program. See the word “Restore”? Click that, and on the popup that appears, click “Create a restore point”. This is just incase something goes wrong, and I assure you, nothing will go wrong.</p>
<p>Once that’s done, click the big “Care!” button. If a popup appears, just close it, and click the Care button again. Advanced SystemCare will begin scanning your computer, and doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Spyware Removal</span> <span class="bbcode-i">(Scan and remove spyware, adware)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Registry Fix</span> <span class="bbcode-i">(Cleanup registry to improve performance)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Privacy Sweep</span> <span class="bbcode-i">(Erase your activity history and surfing traces. This basically clears your History on IE, FireFox, etc)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Junk Files Clean</span> <span class="bbcode-i">(Clean up junk files and recover disk space)</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once Advanced SystemCare is done doing it’s thing, you can close it.[/quote]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 2: Power Options <span class="bbcode-i">(Laptop only, I believe)</span></span></p>
<p>[quote]Power Options is where many peoples choppiness in Minecraft comes from while playing on a laptop. Navigate to your taskbar, and to the left of your Volume icon, you should see what looks like the white outline of a battery <span class="bbcode-i">(and when your laptop is plugged in, it’ll have a plug beside the battery icon)</span>. Right-click that icon and click “Power Options”.</p>
<p>On the screen that pops up, you should see 3 selectable options; “Balanced”, “Power Saver” and “High Performance”. Select High Performance. High Performance mode drains the laptops battery faster than Balanced and Power Saver, but it increases the performance of your computer, and of course, your games. Obviously, the faster drain in battery power doesn’t matter if your laptop is always plugged in. I found Minecraft to be very choppy when I had my power option set to “Power Saver”.[/quote]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 3: Game Booster</span></p>
<p>[quote]Game Booster is freeware, luckily, and essentially what it does is shuts down various processes running in the background to improve your computers performance and help your games run faster. Shutting down various processes in the background is not something that you should attempt manually via hitting CTRL+ALT+DEL, because you could potentially mess something up.</p>
<p>Run Game Booster, and click “Switch to Gaming Mode”. The program will then stop all unnecessary background processes that tend to eat up RAM. Upon switching to Gaming Mode, I gained about 149MB of RAM. Not too shabby <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>As well, switching to Gaming Mode disables the fancy Aero theme and switches to a plain, non-fancy, no visual styles, non-transparent basic Vista theme. Don’t worry. To switch back to normal mode, click the icon on your taskbar that looks like the Game Booster logo and click Switch to Normal Mode.[/quote]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 4: Other Things</span></p>
<p>[quote]Now that you’ve successfully ran Disk Defragmenter, Advanced SystemCare, switched to High Performance <span class="bbcode-i">(laptops only I believe)</span>, and switched to Gaming Mode with Game Booster, if you want to further increase performance, close any programs you have running such as Windows Live Messenger/MSN/Yahoo Messenger/AIM/etc, any P2P programs like uTorrent/Limewire/Kazaa/etc, iTunes, and whatever else might be eating up RAM. Updating your video card drivers often helps with performance as well.</p>
<p>If you’re really desperate for FPS, while playing Minecraft, go to the Options and set View Distance to Tiny, and switch graphics from “Fancy” to “Fast”.[/quote]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The Results!</span></p>
<p>[quote]Now, assuming you’ve followed my entire guide from start to finish, you should notice a huge increase in FPS. I ran my own tests, and here’s what I got for FPS.</p>
<p>I’m running on an HP G60 Notebook PC, nVidia GeForce 8200M G video card, 3GB of RAM, AMD Athlon Dual-Core QL-60 <a>i</a>[/i] processor, on Windows Vista Home Premium (32-bit), and a Windows Experience Index rating of 3.5.</p>
<p>Running Minecraft Alpha <span class="bbcode-i">(single player)</span> in Gaming Mode <span class="bbcode-i">(from Game Booster)</span>, with MSN shut down, here’s my FPS:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Far view distance/Fast graphics:</span> 25 to 30 FPS<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Normal view distance/Fast graphics:</span> 45 to 52 FPS<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Short view distance/Fast graphics:</span> 60 to 73 FPS<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Tiny view distance/Fast graphics:</span> 79 to 91 FPS <span class="bbcode-i">(Update on this result, I just recently played Alpha again and managed to hit 101 FPS under Tiny view distance and fast graphics)</span></p>
<p>To do the tests, I turned off fog, stood still in one area and waited until the chunk updates stopped, then watched my FPS. I recorded the lowest FPS I got, and then recorded the FPS as it changed, until I got the highest amount of FPS. I did the same thing for all 4 view distance settings. I didn’t test my FPS with Fancy Graphics though, as it was late, and I was tired.[/quote]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">I hope this guide helps you get better performance from your PC! If you have any questions, don’t be afraid to ask. I’m not exactly a genius at this stuff, but a friend of mine recommended Game Booster and Advanced SystemCare and basically told me how to get my PC running to the best of its ability.</span></p>
