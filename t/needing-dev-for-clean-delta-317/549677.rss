    <title>Needing Dev for clean delta 317</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/needing-dev-for-clean-delta-317/549677</link>
    <description>Looking to build a clean delta 317 ground up with 1 Programmer. Needs to be well rounded with 317 source+clients. Needs to have knowledge with cache&#39;s. 
Needs some type of references or past projects. (prefer proof but not required.) This project is already started i code a bit here and there as i work full time. this is no immediate 1 month thing. This project will take time and patience. I want this project to be and excedingly well one. I want this rsps to be the best delta ever seen. (Easier said than done i know this.). Im willing to put the work, effort, and time into it. Are you?

Reasons I believe you should join my team:
1) Im not asking you to code the whole thing by no means. I am coding aswell im not the best at all. But i am pretty well rounded with basic programming.
2) This will not take toll at all on any of your finances. All i ask for is a bit of your time and effort into helping.
3) I dont require a time frame for you to be coding. You code when you can i ask you not take any time out of your personal life to participate in this project.
4) When project is complete you will still be with the server when it goes online if you wish. I will not take anything from you. 
5) When project is completed it will be a mutual agreement between me and you if it will be a release if so you will get your fair share of the creds deserved. (50/50)

now that i have placed my reasons please respond with this format.

              <p>Just curious, why Delta? What are your goals? Best delta ever seen not specific enough. I love delta big fan of the server back in the day. But explain more if what you can offer and what your goals are. Good luck with this.</p>
