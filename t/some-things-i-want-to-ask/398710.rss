    <title>Some things I want to ask</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-things-i-want-to-ask/398710</link>
    <description>I haven&#39;t been connected with the RSC scene much in the past year (give or take a few months, I can&#39;t remember). How are things going as far as development? Any new dupes found? Fill me in.

I also wanted to ask if DDoS is still a problem for server owners. If so is it as bad as it was like a year+ ago (bigger attacks)?</description>

The biggest mistake ever done in RSC scene. If he wouldn’t have done that, people would’ve realised that demonik is shit and somebody would have coded a better base, he would have hosted it for a while, but ended up trusting somebody he shouldn’t and the guy who he trusted would’ve gave it to us, ta-da we would be much further than we are now. Seriously, somebody should make a better base, and maybe I would be more interested to work on something RSC related.</p>
<p>Before you say “Make one yourself”, I simply don’t understand networking yet. I would make worse base than RSCD is.</p>

You people totally ignore one thing. DDoS has happened for years, and keep in mind that ANYBODY can go to hacking forum, set up a botnet and buy 10+k bots and take a server down, in less than a hour.</p>

Okay, my point is, everyone knows that ur server is crap compared to other servers that were up at the time you started.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Maybe in your opinion but that means very little. If it’s ‘crap compared to other servers that were up’ then it wouldn’t have grown. We started with a blank database and went from there.[/quote]And as I stated earlier, you had people ddos other servers.<br>
I don’t need to prove anything to you, because that is what I believe to be true.</p>

<p>Prove it… and even if that was true, I bet my right arm that the attacks were no where near as big and constant as the attacks we receive so it’s not really a viable excuse since I have to deal with it every single day…</p>
<p><img src="http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/3835/graphattackphp.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>It’s very rare that a day goes by without seeing at least a 1gB/s attack. There was a <span class="bbcode-b">constant</span> 5-18gB/s attack for several days according to Staminus. This costs thousands per month to protect against and is only possible through players subscribing. It’s a community effort to stay online. For anyone that doesn’t understand the chart, KO9 told me that the largest attack they ever saw was 6gB/s back when Tewl and Hixk was attacking them constantly. Now when I see it’s only 6gB/s I get relieved…</p>
<p>RSCEmulation started by GaWdZ hosting Project P2P’s source on his own personal PC with zero funding. It took us 2 months before we could afford a dedicated server through players donating. We worked our way up from there. You cannot even begin to try and blame me for other servers failing. It’s the servers owners responsibility to make it a success, it’s all to easy to blame your failure on someone else. I could have given up at one of the thousand hurdles I’ve had to go over and blame someone else but that’s not what makes a successful server that thousands of players play week in, week out.[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s because most skids just buy access to a ‘booter’ now, rather than actually making themselves a botnet (which they’d suck at).  I’d think that a ‘booter’ would need to push at least 1 gbps if it was going to be useful, seeing people are now using VPNs with 1 gbps of DDoS protection.  If a ‘booter’ is being used, just see if there is an interval that the attacks are happening (it should be around 2 minutes or so) where it lets up, then comes back.</p>
<p>Anyway, Staminus must be loving the attacks, seeing they’re low packet count, with pretty large packets (about 10 Kb / 1.25 KB for the massive peaks, and like 5-6 Kb / 0.6 - 0.75 KB for the rest of the decent sized attacks) and a low number of them.  I would imagine that they stand out from the rest of the traffic.  Though, it’s kind of hard to tell from the graph, especially because it seems like multiple attacks are going on in the same graph (for example, May 2, 11:32 2011 looks like it’s a different attack, because the packets are about 2 times bigger than attacks that have a massive peek).</p>
<p>Also, the attacks from April 6th to around April 8th seem to be slightly different than the attacks from April 8th, to April 10th.  It’s really hard to tell though, seeing the graph’s scale is so large, and just the lack of data.</p>
<p>There is an interesting point on the graph (Jan 29, 00:17 2011) where the pps is much higher than the actual amount of data being sent (in kbps), I’m kind of curious as to what was going on.</p>
<p>It’s kind of funny that they’re wasting that much bandwidth to attack, when they could use a small fraction to attack at the application-layer and actually take it down.  If they were to use those resources to just have accounts log in and walk around (while constantly wearing/removing items), I don’t see the software being able to handle that (especially how RSCD is).  They could also simulate browsing the forums at a relatively high rate (for an actual person) and potentially make the web server have a rough time trying to handle all the requests.</p>
<p>Anyway, I should probably stop explaining how to take down servers, and get back to how to prevent/recognize an attack, as well as how they’re being executed.</p>

</aside>
<p>Do you even have a clue what a mid-high range attack is?</p>
<p>Some DDoS attacks are hundreds of Gigabits per second…  There is no way you can possibly claim you’ll be able to handle a large DDoS attack with 4 gbps protection, and a 1 gbps line.</p>
<p>You’d be lucky to handle a mid range attack, seeing you can cover the very low end of a mid-range attack.  Furthermore, a 500 mbps attack could easily take your sever down, if it was done intelligently.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I understand you’re to defend your friend but I would love to see proof of an attack in the RSC scene that has reached anywhere near what you claim.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m not defending anyone, I’m pointing out how ridiculous your claims are.</p>
<p>Also, I never claimed there have been attacks of several hundred gbps in the RSC scene, please learn how to read…</p>
<p>Anyway, finding someone with that can create a 10+ gbps isn’t that hard…  All you need to do is go to pretty much any hacking forum…</p>
<p>Furthermore, a single computer can take down your game/site with an application-layer attack.  Apache’s web server is easy to take down when the sysadmin doesn’t know how to configure it to handle attacks (which is pretty much everyone).  RSCD is easy to take down as well…  Anyone with a decent connection can take both down…</p>

<p>Do you even have a clue what a mid-high range attack is?</p>
<p>Some DDoS attacks are hundreds of Gigabits per second…  There is no way you can possibly claim you’ll be able to handle a large DDoS attack with 4 gbps protection, and a 1 gbps line.</p>
<p>You’d be lucky to handle a mid range attack, seeing you can cover the very low end of a mid-range attack.  Furthermore, a 500 mbps attack could easily take your sever down, if it was done intelligently.[/quote]</p>
<p>I understand you’re to defend your friend but I would love to see proof of an attack in the RSC scene that has reached anywhere near what you claim.</p>
