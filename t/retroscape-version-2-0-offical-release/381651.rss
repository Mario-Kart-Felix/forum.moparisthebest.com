<p>No, it’s more like giving someone a $50 bill (I’d give it more value than 5) and finding out it’s fake after you try to spend it.</p>

Sorry to say but V1 was horrible… I used it, it had like soooo fucking much Anti-Leech, and all it was, was a copy of Impact 2.0… I saw no major difference, and most pictures on V1 were fake…</p>
<p>I fixed about 10 bugs, yet there were soooo many others that I just had to switch sources. The combat is horrible (Yes I fixed the anti leech with the defence/attack formulas…), e.g. you attack a monster and you have to click it like 3 times.</p>
<p>I honestly would not recommend anyone to use this, just because of the major anti leech put on it…<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>/facepalm, you are the shittest troll i’ve ever seen, “oh hey my name is James_Akins, I just troll saying pictures are fake” there are no “Major” bugs, combat is perfected better then shitty PI, all versions released arn’t leeched and you sir couldn’t even change a Server name.[/quote]<br>
Yeah, because the 1 thing I released I was planning on making a server out of, but I gave up, and decided to release what I had done for noobs who wanted a PvP server. I totally can’t change a server name, when I’ve owned 2 servers that have reached 200 and 300 players. I’m so bad. I leech all day bro.</p>
<p>Good combat, you say? I’m pretty sure I looked at the combat formulas and they happened to be making your defence be reduced to 0, and your attack to some number way over what it should be, thus the reason you are hitting constantly.</p>
<p>No fake pictures, huh? Then how come when I went to Pest control on your last released source, the interface wasn’t working in the boat (You had a screenshot of it) and the interface wouldn’t open when you talked to the NPC’s there (You had a screenshot of it).</p>
<p>Yeah I’m such a troll, because I can point out your horrible flaws and false statements, that you can’t back up.</p>
