    <description>This review just frustrated me because I didn&#39;t actually have a chance to review the bloody thing. 
Just a tip: Be careful who you make staff.

<p><span class="bbcode-b">P.S. I don’t recommend your channel to anyone, 1 subscriber, under 100 views. Also you got jailed for spamming the call help button and then you were silent the whole time… before you showed it in the video of course ! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> why would you show that?. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></span></p>
<p>Last thing. you said “This review just frustrated me because <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-b">I didn’t actually have a chance to review the bloody thing.</span></span><br>
Just a tip: Be careful who you make staff.”</p>
<p>I am sorry for your experience on it but your account has 20 minutes of playtime on it and I don’t think it’s really fair to review my server like this when you have barely played it.[/quote]</p>
<ol>
<li>You should have ended that reply where the bold text starts. I reviewed another server last week and the review was mostly negative. However, the owner of the server hopped on to the thread and completely accepted the criticism and even listed out all the future changes he was making. He made is clear it was a work in progress.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your attitude is the complete opposite. Even with the staff abuse taken out, there were so many flaws.</p>
<ul>
<li>The prayer icons didn’t display. I wasn’t aware that this was so difficult.</li>
<li>The chat was constantly spammed with custom text that shouldn’t have been there.</li>
<li>When using the bank, IDs started popping up within chat.</li>
<li>When using various UI elements, IDs started popping up as well.</li>
<li>The screenshot functionality does not work all the time, if at all.</li>
<li>Majority of the menu items do not work.</li>
<li>The login section has a terrible appearance. Buttons aren’t aligned.</li>
<li>Text isn’t aligned within the login section.</li>
<li>Your custom ‘PK Area’ is merely the edgeville yew section.</li>
<li>The PKing UI outide city bounds tells me barely anything.</li>
<li>You list donator shops as a feature. These aren’t a positive feature.</li>
<li>Half of your custom settings aren’t functoional.</li>
<li>Changing appearance from the custom menu doesn’t work.</li>
<li>There’s a delay using the standard settings tab in the UI. Some do nothing.</li>
<li>Donator items seem to unbalance the economy.</li>
<li>Quest text isn’t set up properly.</li>
<li>There’s no inbuilt menu for skill information.</li>
<li>I may be wrong but the creation of new accounts isn’t checked so large amounts of money can be generated by exploiting the system.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was all within the first five minutes.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>You don’t recommend my video to anyone? That’s completely fine. I only produce them for a little bit of fun and so I can still contribute to this community in a small way. If I wanted more views, then I would be spamming my link on every forum I could and paying for ads. That’s not why I messed around with it. Hell, I wouldn’t even be making Runescape-based content. It would be much better for me to be covering other games.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorrect. There was no button ‘spam’. It would have been twice max. I test the UI and then leave to go test whatever else. My video is a first impression-type series. If it was a new user, they wouldn’t have any idea what was going on. Especially if they play without chat. I was then kept in your ‘jail’ for a fair length. 20 minutes was long enough to figure out that I was having a terrible experience playing on your server.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Plus, you explicitly tell your staff members not to do this:<br>
<a href="http://eternalflame.smfforfree.com/index.php/topic,21.msg24.html#msg24" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://eternalflame.smfforfree.com/index.php/topic,21.msg24.html#msg24</a></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>If you want a positive review, then produce quality content. Then again,  I haven’t got much hope if you’re being honest when you say that you’ve been developing this for two months.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you believe I’ve missed the mark, then feel free to private message me.<br>
I’ll happily record a video with us on Skype.</p>
<p>@ silab: Hahaha brilliant. I need to start messing about like that in the videos. I saw your post in the other thread and had a big chuckle when I saw the name you were using.</p>
