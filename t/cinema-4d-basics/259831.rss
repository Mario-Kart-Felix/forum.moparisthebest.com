    <title>Cinema 4D Basics</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cinema-4d-basics/259831</link>
    <description>Okay, I have seen quite a few people post a topic of a couple of their first c4d models but then they never post again. I don&#39;t know exactly why, but I think it is because they don&#39;t have a basic understanding of the program. So I will just focus on the basics of Cinema 4D. I will be using R10 of c4d, and I think thats what most people use.

First thing I want to point out is a few &quot;must use&quot; tools.

The tools I use for every project I do is, point tool, edge tool, and polygon tool. The are on the left side tool bar.

You want to use these tools for object modeling, basically that means instead of making a ton of primitives and putting them on top of each other for a shape, you take one primitive and use those three tools I mentioned above to extrude for the shape you want. Make sure you make your object editable by hitting C or clicking the &quot;Make Object Editable&quot; button.

Next, what good is knowing what to do with the polygon, point,and edge tool if you don&#39;t know how to select them?

For anything you should need to select, use the Live selection tool.
[img]http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n94/archerer98/LS.jpg[/img]
Depending on what your selecting, either check or un check &quot; Only select visible elements&quot;. Doing so is useful for selecting points or polygons without accidentally selecting polygons you can&#39;t see. You can adjust your radius for bigger or smaller selection range.

Third, you should be familiar with the Move, Scale, and Rotate tool.
[img]http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n94/archerer98/msr.jpg[/img]
When using one of these tools, make sure you have the object tool selected if you want to effect the whole object and not just the selected polygons. The object tool looks like this.

I wont really go into NURBS other then that you should use hyperNURBS to smooth out your models.

For object modeling you should use really only have to use the Bevel and the Extrude tool.
[img]http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n94/archerer98/be.jpg[/img]
Use the Extrude tool to extrude polygons or edges outward or inward, and the Bevel tool to smooth out edges.

For rendering, a basic scene is a must. You can use STH&#39;s Studio setup tutorial if you want through this link.
http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,319151.0.html
I do not use Studio setups much because I have my own little way of making a scene which I like. I create a floor first.
[img]http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n94/archerer98/floor.jpg[/img]
Next I create a light.
[img]http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n94/archerer98/light.jpg[/img]
Go into the shadow tab on the light and turn Shadow Maps (Soft) on and if you want change density.
Then I go to my front view and zoom out so your model is small and move it to the bottom right corner, and drag your light to the top left or around there.
[img]http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n94/archerer98/fv.jpg[/img]
Now right click your light and go to Cinema 4D tags and choose a target tag.
Drag your model into the Target Object field and the light will point to your object.
[img]http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n94/archerer98/fv2.jpg[/img]
Now, you just have to go back into perspective view and move your light around a bit more till you get it where you like.
I saw that setup in a tutorial and edited it a bit for my taste.

I will not go into materials because STH made a tutorial for it already.

Since this tutorial is for complete beginners really, I will not go any further. If there is something anyone would like me to cover that I didn&#39;t, just ask in the thread. Hopefully people wont give up so fast now.</description>
