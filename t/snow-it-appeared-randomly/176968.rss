    <title>Snow, it appeared randomly</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/snow-it-appeared-randomly/176968</link>
    <description>Hi guys, after I got rid of SYIPKPKER from my server, I logged on to find there was snow everywhere. How can I get rid of it. I don&#39;t think the two things are connected, but I still want to get rid of the snow. It looks gayified.

Many Thanks

              <p>Thanks, I don’t really want to do that, because it may leave bugs. Plus, if I release the source, I want future user to be able to use it. But it’s fixed now anyway.</p>
