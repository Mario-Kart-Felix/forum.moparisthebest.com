    <description>[Delta] Any server with 90-100% Skills 

Hello, I know it is so late to request that, but do anyone have the links for any server (source+client) that is Delta based and has a 90-100% Skills and minigames, etc .. main stuff. 

I would prefer if it has 400+ sprites like hp, prayer, running interfaces in the top right new the map and updated frame of the client etc ...(if that what they call them.) But still, a normal 317 delta wouldn&#39;t be rejected x.x Thanks.</description>
