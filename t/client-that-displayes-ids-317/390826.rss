    <title>Client that displayes IDs [317]?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-that-displayes-ids-317/390826</link>
    <description>I have a client that used to show the IDs of everything you right-clicked (so if you right clicked money it would should ID 995 along with the other options). Also when I right-clicked an object  it showed the ID (bank booth would show 2213).
It makes it so much easier when I can see the ID&#39;s of everything (instead of having to go through lots of ID lists). So I was wondering if any of you knew how to add this to this other client I&#39;m using? I would REALLY appreciate if you helped me! Thanks. 

Btw I searched for a tut to do this but I couldn&#39;t find any. 

PLEASE HELP!</description>
