    <description>What I was thinking was I wanted to do something special like when you create a new character you start at tutorial island and you have to click which Side you wanna choose and after you picked you go to the Castle, Place what ever I picked and you get special boots and gloves that only your Side can wear so when you try to wear it, it say&#39;s this belongs too Lumby warriors or something and you get a special cape each side and I was thinking of posting guards outside castles and what not making teleporting spots like make my troops auto attack and stuff I know this would take alot of coding but I want this to work out xD because it would be awesum and it would be a PK server except for when you try to attack your own side it wouldn&#39;t work out because it would say they&#39;re safe or something and another thing... How to add more shops and make them openable this is all I need help with ty kkthxbi. ;D</description>
