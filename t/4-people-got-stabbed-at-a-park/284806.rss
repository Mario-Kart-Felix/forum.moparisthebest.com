    <title>4 People got stabbed at a park</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/4-people-got-stabbed-at-a-park/284806</link>
    <description>I was on the bus route to my friends house and saw that the police blocked off a few blocks, there was blood everywhere..

Apparently 4 people got stabbed, and one of the guys got stabbed 4 times.. one in the head, chest, and other parts of his body.

It was absolutely disgusting. If there&#39;s news about it tomorrow I&#39;ll post it in the news section but I&#39;m just disgusted.. On top of that, some idiot in a van hit a car with a bunch of children inside, drove down the alley behind his house and made a run for it while the police were chasing him. This area is fucked up =|</description>

              <p>We were coming home from the store and there were 4 police cars that went by a Wendy’s. We were nosy and followed it, and there were 4 more police cars when we got there. It was blinding from 8 lights, but we could see a dog catch a guy hiding in the weeds and another guy being arrested. Pretty weird, does it really take 8 cops for only a drug bust?</p>

<p>Apparently 4 people got stabbed, and one of the guys got stabbed 4 times… one in the head, chest, and other parts of his body.</p>
<p>It was absolutely disgusting. If there’s news about it tomorrow I’ll post it in the news section but I’m just disgusted… On top of that, some idiot in a van hit a car with a bunch of children inside, drove down the alley behind his house and made a run for it while the police were chasing him. This area is fucked up =|[/quote]<br>
Don’t fucking narc me out on this one or you’ll be next.</p>
