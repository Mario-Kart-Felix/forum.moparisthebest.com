Quite interesting, and would like to see everyones choices and their reasons for leaving them in or cutting them. You don&#39;t have to be from the US, I just thought it would be interesting to see what people would do in that position.</description>

<p>Actually no, at first i was for the carbon tax for that reason until i found out more about the consequences. It will just stifle business activity and would lead to carbon tax trade. Would change very little actually other than <span class="bbcode-i">initially</span> bringing in more money to the government, which would affect overall production. It would help the environment a bit, but its not worth the economical impact. Look at California, it has the most strict environmental regulations in the country and businesses are leaving state in droves. The state is the most bankrupt of all of our states and its surviving off of government subsidies, and its supposed to have the 6th largest economy in the world.</p>
<p>And to the bank tax. Banks are the ones handing out loans, and theyll just pass that extra tax off to consumers. Its a lose lose for everyone. Theyre going to lose more tax revenue in the long run over that policy.</p>
<p>You’re going to have to remember (not just you) that the American economy works almost in the exact opposite way of European countries.</p>

Whats it like being homeless in the netherlands? Im talking about complete homeless people that walk around with shopping carts full of trash. Im pretty sure here they can go to a local shelter and vote, if any of them care.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Doesn’t everyone in the USA have a SSN?[/quote]<br>
Pretty sure thats what shelters use to keep track. If they remember it and arent drunk.</p>
<p>This may not be completely relevant, but im sure the argument about entitlement programs and government handouts will come out again. Not many people believe me when i try and explain some peoples attitude towards Obama like hes god.

<p>The major ones are the VAT and the closing of tax loopholes. IMO tax loopholes need to be closed, but VAT wouldn’t really be that great. Carbon tax would encourage a shift to more efficient + healthier energy sources. I also have mixed feelings about the bank tax.</p>
<p>Here is a more tax-moderate proposal:</p>

<p>Theres some that can have residence at shelters and be able to vote. But the others are practically impossible to keep track of. And when people like Obama go around outskirts of cities and walk around ditches full of homeless people with a clipboard, you cant prevent fraud.</p>

<p>you can’t slash foreign and domestic aid like that without an uproar.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Its been needed to be done for years and its only getting worse and worse. As to the foreign aid, we give out billions to other countries every year and no one seems to care, so maybe if we stop itll ring a bell. Besides, we have enough private organizations donating money to countries in need.</p>
<p>I dont want to get rid off all domestic aid, just makes sure people who need it are getting it.</p>

</aside>
<p>The problem was slow and drawn out for years, since right before WW2. You cant just raise taxes for everyone as a quick solution and expect them to keep working. Right now our economy has $3T estimated that its holding back on. People just aren’t spending, they’re waiting to see what happens. Cutting taxes encourages spending and makes it easier for companies to wiggle back out</p>

<p>I thought the point of this thread was to debate about each others choices on the puzzle? I just wanted you to bring up a few and i would explain why i did them. Oh yea, just because we don’t agree doesn’t mean its “Bullshit”. But to someone like you it may be.</p>

<p>You completely underestimate public response to such cuts, you can’t slash foreign and domestic aid like that without an uproar. With something like this its just as much about public opinion as it is the debt. Bare in mind whatever changes you make you probably want to serve another term in goverment if possible. So the solution will be slow and drawn out over years.</p>

<p>Not all the available options are there, did what i could with what we have. If im reading the results right, I think its funny that i managed to pick up more money than anyone else in this thread by doing the complete opposite. Some of your options were ridiculous and a very quick solution that will hurt more than it helps.</p>

</aside>
<p>P. sure again that the best way to help the poor, rather than giving them money directly, is to help them through programs to help them get a job and shelters and shit. (Forgive me I am very ignorant on such subjects but im sure u know this by now…)</p>
<p>Why so defensive though?  :o I’m not American, I have no secret agenda, I was just pointing out that you spend proportionally more than every country in the world on your military for largely unnecessary reasons. Any money saved could you know, pay back some of the debt just having a large military causes, even if it’s relatively small by American standards.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s a nice incentive sure but then would you stand for a big faceless corporation demanding their workers only be paid $1 or 2 an hour(or even less) not being allowed breaks? Ok I’m exaggerating slightly but still, they can get away with this type of shit in “lesser” countries, what reason would there be to stay in America? Fair conditions for the workers or cheap labour, capitalism is always the latter yeeah baby!</p>

<p>We use it to bail out liberal states and pay for all of these unconstitutional entitlement programs.</p>

</aside>
<p>and again, why so defensive? I’m sure there’s better things to spend the money on/fix first than spend it on those lazy liberals waiting for a government handout and I’m sure you know this too, what’s concerning though is the fact you speak of these programs as if it’s the ONLY thing wrong with America.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most retarded comment ever. We don’t borrow money to fund our military. We borrow money from China to pay for social security, welfare, unemployment, medicare, medicaid, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I know this and you know this, as you quite clearly said in the full quote I chopped up. Nothing was said or implied about it being used for the military, sorry if it was. How about I reiterate it though? Rather than cutting things back(such as military) to help pay for other programs([1]) you borrow money, all I know is this doesn’t work on the small scale. (Because you don’t cut things back or because you spend too much on other things, the cause is largely irrelevant until it is close to a fixable state)</p>
<p>[1]: The whole world isn’t going to attack you if you cut military spending back as you seem to imply.</p>

<p>What’s to break? A proper military isn’t going to declare war on America and you know, your homeland is pretty safe as it is. Nothing ventured nothing gained, or as the case as you insist is, everything ventured nothing gained.</p>
