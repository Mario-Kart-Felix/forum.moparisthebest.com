    <description>to every action there is a consequence.

now that we have that covered, from the beginning of time, there was 1 action--arguably GOD, and everything else that is happening is a consequence to that one action, therefore everything that you think, do, or say is merely just a consequence to that initial action, and there is nothing you can do about it.  this might be the theory of predestination but i dont think it explains it quite like this. thoughts? (even though nothing matters and we are all just consequences facing the unknown--the future of our consequence)</description>

<p>you guys completely misinterpreted my theory which is understandable because i didn’t exactly make an entire wiki on it. i meant that the beginning of time set of by one action just multiplied into literally A QUADRILLION BILLION BILLION…and so on…consequences, and that everything you know, have ever known, ever seen, any events (implying ANY type of life event expl: you dropping your cars keys on accident) you have ever experienced, anything ever heard, and touched are just a consequence to that one action. its all explained in my mind that’s probably why i only understand it!</p>
<p>if you went back in time and changed ANYTHING the consequences would probably be drastic. which is something of the point of i was trying to make i guess.</p>

Saying ‘God’ and God is different firstly. Secondly, whats funny about saying God? I don’t find it funny personally.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/team_rocket">@team_rocket</a><br>
I know in which context they’re meant to be used, I just choose not to use them correctly. With things like that I have to stop what I’m doing and think about it, it doesn’t come naturally to me so when I type informally I neglect it.<br>
I.e. when I’m saying telling someone directions etc I say North right and so on because I have to think about what direction it is in my head first. Its just convenient for me to say it the easy way basically; as long as people get the point.</p>

On Topic: Time Travel cannot be made possible, and is not possible. It violates the laws of this Earth as we know them and goes against everything we know to be true. If Time Travel can be made possible, then Mankind must admit that we truly know nothing in terms of the Universe and our own existence.</p>
<p>[/quote]<br>
It is very possible</p>
<p>just not practical[/quote]</p>
<p>Well, that’s true if you believe that <span class="bbcode-i">“anything is possible”</span>. I <span class="bbcode-u">highly</span> doubt it will be made possible in our lifetimes. If It’s discovered, it will probably be kept a secret for a very long time. I mean… how in the world could such a thing be regulated and controlled? Not to mention that nobody knows of the possible consequences or blowback from such a thing. We got a glimpse of an example of this though in the Movie (lol): “Back to the Future”, in which the main character “Marty McFly” (that’s seriously the character’s Name), goes back to the 1950’s, and almost goofs by nearly nailing his own Mother.</p>
<p>However, and I’m just dragging on at this point, but I believe that if at some point in the future Time Travel is discovered, that this will prove we cannot possibly be alone in this Universe.</p>

<p>I’m tired of seeing this incorrect usage. Here’s this:</p>
<blockquote>Use [b]there[/b] when referring to a place, whether concrete ("over [b]there[/b] by the building") or more abstract ("it must be difficult to live [b]there[/b]").
<p>Also use <span class="bbcode-b">there</span> with the verb BE (is, am, are, was, were) to indicate the existence of something, or to mention something for the first time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Use [b]their[/b] to indicate possession. It is a possessive adjective and indicates that a particular noun belongs to them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Remember that [b]they're[/b] is a contraction of the words they and are. It can never be used as a modifier, only as a subject (who or what does the action) and verb (the action itself).</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think that -.-. Just because I said something created our universe it doesn’t mean its god. i.e. energy can make certain elements can merge together to form a compound. You don’t say the energy is god do you? If you read previous posts I didn’t say it had to be living, I made sure specifically to say it can be none lifeless.<br>
Simply, read my initial post <span class="bbcode-b">very</span> carefully and you’ll understand my conclusion to why I came to the conclusion my theory is viable. If something doesn’t make sense then ask me but so far everything you have asked me about it has been previously explained.</p>

<p>You don’t know how much I’ve learned and you also don’t know which areas I studied.<br>
I have not given any hints to give you an idea of how much I’ve learned. The only assumption you can make is how educated I am by the way I type to you and even that would give you a most likely incorrect answer. I’m not saying I know more, equal or less than you in that regard; I’m saying you need to stop assuming things when you talk/type (w.e. you want to call it) to me.<br>
Making assumptions based on judgements is the way forward but you base judgements based on your opinion which is the way backwards considering your high % of incorrect assumptions.</p>
<p>[/quote]<br>
You said you knew something about time, then it was safe to assume that you had learned something about general and special relativity. I based this upon this comment: “I did do physics for two years.”  I also assumed that people have some knowledge about the stuff they post.</p>
<p>I might have done some wrong assumption about you, but what about science did I get wrong?[/quote]<br>
No its not, I never said where I got that knowledge from. I stated I did physics in response to knowing its impossible to reach the speed of light.<br>
I never stated it was anything to do with science that you got wrong.<br>
Their you go again assuming something incorrect.<br>
Your like females you used to see in high school. They’d be really good at whatever subjects they were in but outside of class they were dumb as fuck. AKA - You lack wisdom/common sense, whatever you want to call it.</p>
