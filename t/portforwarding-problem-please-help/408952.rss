    <title>Portforwarding Problem, please help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/portforwarding-problem-please-help/408952</link>
    <description>Hey guys.

I had a server some months ago, running really good, using utorrent though. When i switched router it went off, i tried to portforward agian, but it didn&#39;t work, i think i am doing something wrong.  :confused:
Now i have changed the router agian, and im trying to portforward both with router and utorrent, but it never works. Also when i try on other computers it wont work there either, im doing something wrong, im pretty sure about it.
Can any of you guys help me or teamview me or anything? 
If any of you guys can help me and fix it, i will gladly give them co, admin or mod :)
Here&#39;s a pic of the portforwarding i tried:
