    <title>Project 5 Development</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-5-development/199700</link>
    <description>I have been working on Project 5, a server source to be released soon, and decided to give tech specs and sneak peaks. I have made this from semi-scratch and give full credit to all server developers out there. I hope you like it, it has taken me a while, please comment!
