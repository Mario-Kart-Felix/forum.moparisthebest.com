    <title>REP ++ Moparscape Vet</title>

    <description>This topic summarizes two main ideas. Before you automatically read the topic and go bananas, people care about reputation. You can post the fact that no one cares, and it&#39;s just a pointless number (which it is), but people do care about it. If we have the system already integrated with these forums, shouldn&#39;t we use this feature to the fullest abilities? Now my suggestion to the community is, let&#39;s try one last rep reset this time, I feel like most elitists are gone from this community, and if we enforced more rules about reputation it would be more regulated and worth while; give a small amount of reputation to all Moparscape Vets or the Staff and it shouldn&#39;t be abused. 


If the reputation system gets cleaned, then shouldn&#39;t we bring back (fully) the Moparscape Vet awards and start actively handing them out again? Without a decent reputation system it&#39;s harder to decide whose worthy of this award which also makes sense to be another reason as why the award isn&#39;t given out anymore.
