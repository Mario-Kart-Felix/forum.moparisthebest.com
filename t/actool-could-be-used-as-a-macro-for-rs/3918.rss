    <title>ACTool could be used as A macro for RS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/actool-could-be-used-as-a-macro-for-rs/3918</link>
    <description>Ill try to do this without posting a link to ACTools since i kno runescape is watching :| well, this tool was made in the good old days of Asherons call but i think that this must be a client sided game. However, Runescape offers a web client on their website and maybe you could use something like that or swiftswitch as a client and use this tool/bot. This is my first post so excuse if someone else has said this before. The tool has many useful things on it might be just as useful as aryan was a while ago.

Thanks</description>

              <p>Lol. Not gonna happen. To implement a bot into the runescape client, it would require downloading the client source (with it obbed 'n all + in .class files). Then creating a code for the bot to do certain tasks, like click on an object or item. This has already been done and has been owned. With Jagex’s new game engine, it’s been a pain in the butt figuring out a new way to bypass their anti-macro system (traps) and de-obsuficate the client.</p>
<p>Hope you learned something about that.</p>
<p>P.S. SwiftSwitch connects to the same URL as the client from <a href="http://runescape.com" rel="nofollow noopener">runescape.com</a> does. So think of SwiftSwitch as internet explorer that’s just going directly to the client URL without having to type and click your way to play the game. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
