              <p>Very good news. Tobi without the mask is playable and possibly the ten tails as an awakening. We also have a new cover, check out the people on it… BIJUU MINATO!?!<br>

<p>There is also gameplay of all Edo Kage:<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jg6vHaxM4Tw" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Third Raikage</a><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpq9XUQmzLQ" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Forth Kazekage</a><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDGzsCsedaM" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Second Tsuchikage</a><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6CYz6AA7kg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Second Mizukage</a><br>
To be honest these characters don’t look that impressive. Not as hyped as I was when I heard they were supposed to be in Storm 3.</p>
<p>They say there’s going to be over 100 characters but I’m wondering how many of them are just costume changes. There were rediculous duplicates in Storm 3 like Killer Bee having two slots with the same moves with the addition of Kisames shark sword. I’m also skeptical if this is even going to follow Canon, Generations didn’t go forward through the manga and this probably wont as well. But lets hope it does.</p>
<p>A really bad trailer was also released. He’s really overdue but Orochimaru in Akatuski gear is finally playable.<br>

              <p>I want a more… diversion of combat. The first few Ninja Storms started to become stale (even with slight changes to substitution and awakening modes). While I enjoy the flat stages, I can only imagine what they could do if they took a page from Dragonball Z’s Budokai Tenkaichi/Raging Blast maps.</p>
<p>Some things that would go well:<br>
Required lock-on (stuns/disables/beat down combos which remove lock-on)<br>
Chakra sensing based on current chakra level (no chakra makes it harder) - This could remove the opponents HP and Chakra bar completely and you’d have to focus completely on trying to stay alive as techniques create a huge impact on whether you win or lose and being able to see your opponents health allows you to capitalize on your obvious lead. But if you can’t see it and you land a big hit, you’ll obviously be moralized to continue, but your opponent can capitalize on any hidden traps set beforehand (another thing I’d like to see, since Ninja Storm uses items already) to turn the tide around into their favor.<br>
Techniques to disguise chakra (shadow clone is a dispersion of chakra, but eye techniques (which should consume chakra and not be an “awakening”) can reveal the real one)<br>
Combo variation affected by multiple inputs and not just directional attack inputs and cancelling.<br>
Awakening modes to feel more a part of the characters kit and not just an OP last effort high damage comeback.<br>
Anime/manga based cinematics QTE affected by stages and moves (i.e Sasuke and Naruto battle with Chidori + Rasengan)<br>
More emphasis on genjutsu techniques and not just triangle/Y + circle/B to dish out a characters move set. Make it feel more like you’re playing a different opponent each time because their kit can be different each time.</p>
<p>These are just things that I think about. Something to make it feel more like Naruto and not just another button smasher.</p>
