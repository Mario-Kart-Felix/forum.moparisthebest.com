    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/people-cant-log-on-to-my-server-now/295466</link>
    <description>Everyone could log onto my server yesterday and today but now they can&#39;t for some reason now. They get error connecting to server. I didn&#39;t touch port forward thing. But I don&#39;t have static IP becuse my ISP won&#39;t let me. Could that be why? if it is how do i fix?

EDIT: do you think someone might have crashed server?</description>

<p>Static IP simply means your IP changes everyday. It may be the problem, if someone crashed your server then it would be on 3-5min maybe less.</p>

<p>Actually… DYNAMIC IP changes every time.<br>
Static is permanent.</p>
