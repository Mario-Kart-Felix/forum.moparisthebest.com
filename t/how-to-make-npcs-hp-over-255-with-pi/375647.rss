    <title>How to make NPC&#39;s HP over 255 with PI</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-npcs-hp-over-255-with-pi/375647</link>
    <description>I want to make TD&#39;s have 300+ hp like real rs, but if I set it at 376 or whatever, when you fight the monster it has an HP bar and when it hits 0 theres ANOTHER hp bar because the max it can have is 255, SOOO I wanted to know how I can raise that to over 255 so I can have 376 HP on 1 health bar.

Thanks to anyone who can help!</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>I googled this when I realized that making a Corp Beast with the correct amount of HP would piss a lot of players off since it would refill the HP bar like 20 times, but the only relevant result was this topic.</p>
<p>I gotta admit, I was disappointed when the only thing I found was a help topic, but what meiscooldude posted helped me a LOT.<br>
It wasn’t completely accurate, but it was on the right track, and helped me come up with the solution.</p>
<p>This took me an hour to figure out because I kept declaring the double variable wrong, but I finally got it to work perfectly.</p>
<p>Open up npc.java   (server.model.npcs)</p>
<p>Search…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public void appendHitUpdate(Stream str) {</code></pre>
<p>The last two lines in that method, excluding the closing bracket, should be these…</p>
<p><code>str.writeByteS(HP); 
str.writeByteC(MaxHP); </code></p>
<p>Like meis said, bytes have a maximum value of 255, so when it tried to write MaxHP when it was over that value, it fucked up.</p>
<p>Replace the two lines mentioned with the following…</p>
<p><code>double HP2 = ((((double)(HP)) / ((double)(MaxHP)))*255);
int WriteHP = ((int)(HP2));
str.writeByteS(WriteHP); 
str.writeByteC(255);</code></p>
<p>Go down a few lines and you should see…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public void appendHitUpdate2(Stream str) {</code></pre>
<p>…which is used for double hitting attacks (i.e. Dragon Dagger Special Attack).</p>
<p>The last two lines at the end of the void are similar, but the naming is off.</p>
<p><code>str.writeByteA(HP); 
str.writeByte(MaxHP); </code></p>
<p>Even though the method naming is different, their arguments are the same as before, so we can handle them the same way.<br>
Replace those two lines with the following…</p>
<p><code>double HP2 = ((((double)(HP)) / ((double)(MaxHP)))*255);
int WriteHP = ((int)(HP2));		
str.writeByteA(WriteHP); 
str.writeByte(255); </code></p>
<p>I tested this on my PI server with max hp values of 50, 300, and 1000, all of which worked perfectly.<br>
Hope this help you fpkers, and thanks a bunch meiscooldude. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Ideally I believe you would do this server side. And it really shouldn’t be too hard. But of course that is given how I <em>believe</em> it may work, not how it works.</p>

              <p>Yes, that makes sense, though I have no idea how I would do that. I guess it’s not as simple as I thought it would be…<br>
I was expecting to be able to do it server-sided</p>

              <p>Ahh, excellent question!</p>
<p>If I am understanding you correctly I may have a solution (more of a workaround) for you.</p>
<p>My guess is the HP Bar Fill is set using a ‘Byte’. A byte value range of 0-255. No higher, no lower. Which is highly likely why you can’t go over 255. So lets find a way to work around that.</p>
<p>My guess is that if you set his HP Bar Fill to something like, ~128 it would be about half full. 255, completely full, and 0, empty.</p>
<p>So, if we want to represent 0-376 on a 0-255 scale we might do something like this:</p>
<p>//psedocode</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">int monsterMaxHp = 376; //Maximum monster HP
int monsterCurrentHp = 281; //Current monster HP
byte monsterBarFill; //Amount to fill up the health bar

monsterBarFill = (monsterCurrentHp / monsterMaxHp) * 255; //sets monsterBarFill to ~191</code></pre>
<p>Make sense?</p>
