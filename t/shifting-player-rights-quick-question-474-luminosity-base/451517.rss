    <title>Shifting Player Rights (Quick Question) - 474/Luminosity Base</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shifting-player-rights-quick-question-474-luminosity-base/451517</link>
    <description>  Hey guys, quick question. I&#39;m looking to shift all of the player rights up one. For example, Owner = 4, Moderator = 3, Another Rank = 2, Donator = 1, Regular = 0. However, I would like to shift the icons on the left of the player (crowns, etc.) along with the rights. I do not understand where these can be edited because I can not locate these anywhere client-sided. I don&#39;t even have the basic sprite files anywhere (.png or whatever) so that makes me even more clueless on where to edit this even though they [b]DO[/b] work in the game.</description>
