    <title>Happy Wars</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/happy-wars/464304</link>
    <description>Just wondering if anyone else plays this game. For those of you who don&#39;t know about it, its a free (yes, FREE) XBox Live Arcade game that is multiplayer with up to 30 people and is actually pretty fun. I&#39;ve managed to go ~6 hours straight with a few friends playing this. Definitely try it out, theres more info at http://playxbla.com/ee/happy-wars</description>
