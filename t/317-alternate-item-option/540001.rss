    <title>[317] Alternate item option</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-alternate-item-option/540001</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve got a packet number ... 75, which is a third-click item option. Used to control your Amulet of Glory/Ring of Dueling &#39;Rub&#39; options. My problem is, I can&#39;t get any item id&#39;s I add in there to work and complete an action. Here&#39;s what I have....

[code]		case 75: //A third click item option
			int item_id2 = inStream.readSignedWordA();
			if (item_id2 == 1712) {
				sM(&quot;testttt....&quot;);
			}
			break;[/code]

One more quick thing before I conclude this post. I have a packet list for 317 servers, it tells me what the packets do. It says that packet 16 is also a alternate item option. So, here&#39;s my code for that.

[code]		case 16: // Alternative Item Option 2
			int item_id = inStream.readSignedWordA();
			(item_id = 1712) {
				sM(&quot;testttt....&quot;);
			}
			break;
[/code]

and Sure enough, no cigar. Please help? I remember I had problems with these packets before and was able to actually fix them.. But I&#39;ve so recently just got back into my private server coding groove and have been having trouble with this one. If anyone could take 5 minutes out of their day to help, it would be highly appreciated and you&#39;ll be a hero.</description>

It would mess up the combat aspect of it.

Don't delete working stuff, just try to figure out what went wrong.
<p>Good luck!</p>

              <p>Alright, well I must say that was helpful. As for the ‘if’ statement, yeah. I didn’t take that directly from my source, just quickly put the code down that I had from my source. Didn’t c+p, I know an if statement is supposed to be there. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> Thanks for looking out though bro. You’re right too, the case ‘alternate item 3 click’ was dealing with an attack on player first. I deleted the case and re-did it to my standards. Doing so, would that mess up my third-click? My ess pouches work, I even tried doing the same coding that was used for the ess pouches, but it still isn’t working. If I deleted those third-click attack player statements in that case, would it affect the outcome of the glory? I tried adding this…</p>
<p><code>	public void checkGlory() {//charged glory check
		switch (id) {
		case 1712://4 charges
			sM("hi");
		break;
		case 1710://3 charges
			sM("hi");
		break;
		case 1708://2 charges
			sM("hi");
		break;
		case 1706://1 charges
			sM("hi");
		break;
		case 1704:
			sM("Your glory has ran out of charges.");
		break;
		}
	}</code></p>
<p>Then of course in the ‘alternate item click’ packet…</p>
<p><code>if (item_id == 1712 || item_id == 1710 || item_id == 1708 || item_id == 1706 || item_id == 1704) {
checkGlory();
}</code></p>
<p>I know I declared my method in the right spot, this shouldn’t be a problem anymore. But is. What’s going on?</p>
<p>As far as errors, there isn’t compiling errors. Which is strange, it just doesn’t work. I’m not an idiot. I mostly know what I’m doing. I have a mediocre understanding of java and how it works. But for some reason I just can’t get past this problem. Been at it for a good hour now. :S Thank you for your help though pure_, you’ve got me farther than I was. Care to say anything else about this? :\</p>
<p>Edit: Here is a ess pouch filling method that is in the source… [NOT MINE, I AM NOT TAKING CREDS…]</p>
<p><code>	public void fillGiantPouch() {
		int essence = amountOfItem(1436);
		if (!playerHasItem(1436)) {
			sM("You do not have any rune essence to fill.");
			return;
		}
		if (essence &lt; 12) {
			sM("You do not have 12 rune essence to put in this pouch.");
			return;
		}
		if (essence &gt;= 12 &amp;&amp; (giantPouch == 0)) {
			deleteItem(1436, 1);
			deleteItem(1436, 1);
			deleteItem(1436, 1);
			deleteItem(1436, 1);
			deleteItem(1436, 1);
			deleteItem(1436, 1);
			deleteItem(1436, 1);
			deleteItem(1436, 1);
			deleteItem(1436, 1);
			deleteItem(1436, 1);
			deleteItem(1436, 1);
			deleteItem(1436, 1);
			giantPouch += 12;
			return;
		}
		if (giantPouch == 12) {
			sM("Your pouch is full.");
			return;
		}
	}</code></p>
<p>Later… We bring in case 16, and it works? Wtf? Here’s what we’ve got in case 16, as far as an ess pouch…</p>
<p>[code]		case 16: // Alternative Item Option 2</p>
<pre><code>		int item_id = inStream.readSignedWordA();
		if (item_id == 5509) {
			if (smallPouch == 0)
				sM("You do not have any essence in your pouch.");
			if (smallPouch &gt;= 1)
				sM("You have " + smallPouch + " essence in your pouch.");
		}[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>So when you right-click on the small pouch, and click the option ‘check’, (which is the third option down, you know it goes… Fill, empty, check) if your smallPouch value is 0, it says you do not have any ess in the pouch, and it works. I click the ess pouch without a right-click to ‘fill’ it and it says I don’t have ess to fill it. When I try to empty it (second right-click option), it says I have none in the pouch. Seems to work flawlessly the way he coded it…</p>
<p>Another thing I was thinking about, could it be that there is only one option for the glory, other than wear and examine? (Of course) The one option being, ‘rub’. Would I maybe need to just declare that in the alternate item click packet? Which is 16. I’m 99.99% sure I’m not retarded. :’)</p>

              <p>I have not heard of an item action 3 packet, it’s certainly not documented and a server I used as reference had it doing something to do with combat. As for the second you are missing the if statement. You might want to try printing what you’re getting if anything to make sure the values match, you could be getting incorrect values if you’re reading the data-type incorrectly.</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Here is packet 75 being sent. You are clearly not reading the last two values meaning you might be missing the actual information you want. Also you’re reading the values in the wrong format.</p>
<p><code>		if(l == 493)
		{
			stream.createFrame(75);
			stream.method433(k); // short, big endian, special a
			stream.method431(j); // short, big endian
			stream.method432(i1); // short, special a
			atInventoryLoopCycle = 0;
			atInventoryInterface = k;
			atInventoryIndex = j;
			atInventoryInterfaceType = 2;
			if(RSInterface.interfaceCache[k].parentID == openInterfaceID)
				atInventoryInterfaceType = 1;
			if(RSInterface.interfaceCache[k].parentID == backDialogID)
				atInventoryInterfaceType = 3;
		}</code></p>
<p>Here is packet 16, same thing here.</p>
<p><code>		if(l == 539)
		{
			stream.createFrame(16);
