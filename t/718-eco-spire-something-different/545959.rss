[center][size=12pt]You&#39;re here because you&#39;ve been looking for a good Eco server.
[b]You may be a Skiller, a PKer, a PvMer or even a well traveled completionist looking for his/her next challenge.[/b][/size]
If you&#39;re looking for an easy server with ludicrous XP rates, constant rare drops and little in depth content, this is NOT the server for you.

If you&#39;re looking for something challenging, something genuine...  If you&#39;re looking for a good community...  If you&#39;re looking for custom content, something new...
[b][size=12pt]
Spire is for you.[/size][/b]

You have already seen other servers advertise things like &quot;Working curses/goliaths/nex sets&quot;.  
All of the trivial stuff is functional, so we won&#39;t bother listing it.  Instead, here&#39;s the new things Spire may bring to the table.


- Many [b]custom bosses[/b] which will challenge even the strongest players.
- [b]Skilling that is useful[/b], and not just there for a 99 cape.
- A [b]well rounded[/b] economy. 
- [b]Custom weapons[/b], which include custom made special attacks, passive effects etc.
- [b]Carefully constructed drop rates[/b].
- Balanced, [b]less Pay to Win[/b] economy
- [b]NPC Factioning[/b].  
- [b]Daily events[/b].
- [b]Very frequent updates[/b] bringing loads of new content to the table
- [b]The BRUTALITY Waves[/b].

Spire is different.  You will know this the second you log in and try the starter weapons. 
We focus on bringing innovation and new ideas to the table, while keeping things balanced and vanilla.
None of our content is &quot;half-assed&quot;, and as the main coder I enjoy what I do.  
Oh yeah, and all the weapons that didn&#39;t work in other RSPS&#39; such as the Royal Crossbow&#39;s bleed effect?  Yeah we have those too.
We&#39;re hosted on a virtual Cloud, meaning 24/7 uptime with no lag.

We consider all player ideas, and welcome player creativity to help us create more, and better content.  
Players may not donate for overpowered things such as Torva sets, cash, xp, or death-touched darts.  This keeps the Eco balanced, and PvM/Skilling worth it.[/center]
[center]
For the PvM Enthusiasts
[spoiler]Every custom boss brings something new to the table.  I invest lots of time into creating powerful and balanced bosses that are as fun as they are challenging.
Drops are very well balanced, keeping items valuable and making all bosses worth killing.  High level custom bosses are fair, but punishing, and players are left with a sense
of pride when they overcome them.  [/spoiler]

For the Skillers 
[spoiler]Skills are useful, profitable, and provide many benefits in and out of combat.  Upgrading armour with scrap metal from the chaotic rapier that you earned provides an interesting
customizable mechanic to the game and encourages players to do more than just smack General Graardor in the face.  Cosmetics line shops for you to make your skilling pure as kaiwaii as can be.[/spoiler]

For the PKers
[spoiler]You bathe in the virtual blood of your foes.  You bring down opponents by making use of axe, dagger, bow and spell.  You are a battle-hardened veteran who&#39;s collected the loot of countless foes.  You have lots of skill and lots to teach.  This is a feeling I myself know all too well, and because of that I strive to make Spire&#39;s PvP as enjoyable, balanced and hardcore as possible.[/spoiler]

For the Completionist
[spoiler]You&#39;ve traveled server to server.  You&#39;re a hardened RSPS veteran who&#39;s accomplished so much in so little time, the person that that players look up to for guidance and inspiration.  You&#39;ve hunted players, monsters, and the poor unsuspecting iron ore.  You&#39;ve quested, killed, skilled and probably even found a way to gain XP while showering.  Spire is yet another challenge, and one that you&#39;re more than confident you can overcome.  Whether this is the server that you chose to settle in, or just one of many conquests, we know for sure you&#39;ll enjoy your time here.[/spoiler][/center]

[center]We have a TeamSpeak 3 Server which can be accessed by any by connecting to the address below.
neptunium.typefrag.com:8310[/center]


[center]A currently small but social community made up of all walks of RSPS veterancy currently resides in spire.  We welcome you to join us and look forward to seeing you ingame.
You can join us by downloading Spire RSPS below.

<p>you have done everything in ur power to balance the economy and keep it pay to win? so u removed the mystery boxes? thats well within ur power assuming u r the owner of the server. i dont think i ever come across a server that outright sold gold, but i can say i have come across many servers that have sold items for real money. the reason ur players dont feel its pay to win is probaly because the ones that do feel lied to and quit, probaly the moment they saw what was inside the donar store. just take down the “not pay to win” thing at the top so you dont piss off more people.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Servers such as Soul-split and a lot of the ‘big’ ones sell GP, xp and high level items.  Spire does not.<br>
Lots of players who haven’t donated have made positive comments regarding the donator store, and the accessibility of donor currency ingame.</p>
<p>If you try my server and still firmly believe it’s pay to win, then I will remove ‘Not Pay to Win’ from the title.  Mystery boxes were supposed to be a fun method of getting some neat items ingame, hence why the majority of them that come in are as loot from drops, rewards from chests and events.</p>
<p>I do what I can to keep it all balanced, while still being able to pay for Cloud hosting.</p>
<p>If I was to take the title out completely, it would make my efforts of keeping it balanced unrecognizable to someone who only looked at the server advertisement.  It also makes it clear to potential players that you cannot simply join and buy nex sets on your first day.</p>

              <p>In regards to the pay to win comments, I’ve done everything in my power to keep the economy balanced and prevent the game from being ‘Pay to Win’.  As far as I’m concerned, most other servers just outright sell GP and items, and therefore I feel that I’ve set Spire in the right direction.  None of my players or beta testers consider the server to be Pay to Win, and thus I’ve advertised it as so.</p>

<p>Items gained from a mystery box as well as elite mystery boxes are not cosmetic. Just because the currency for your donator shop can be obtained through gameplay does not mean said server is not a pay to win server. Its like selling gp in the server with irl money and stating because gp can be earned in the game means it is not a pay to win server; in fact it is the very definition of pay to win.<br>

<p>Those of us who are looking for a server with features fitting what we are looking for. Its the whole purpose of server advertisements other than gaining players.</p>

[center][size=12pt]You’re here because you’ve been looking for a good Eco server.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">You may be a Skiller, a PKer, a PvMer or even a well traveled completionist looking for his/her next challenge.</span>[/size]<br>
If you’re looking for an easy server with ludicrous XP rates, constant rare drops and little in depth content, this is NOT the server for you.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for something challenging, something genuine…  If you’re looking for a good community…  If you’re looking for custom content, something new…<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">[size=12pt]<br>
Spire is for you.[/size]</span></p>
<p>You have already seen other servers advertise things like “Working curses/goliaths/nex sets”.<br>
All of the trivial stuff is functional, so we won’t bother listing it.  Instead, here’s the new things Spire may bring to the table.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many <span class="bbcode-b">custom bosses</span> which will challenge even the strongest players.</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Skilling that is useful</span>, and not just there for a 99 cape.</li>
<li>A <span class="bbcode-b">well rounded</span> economy.</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Custom weapons</span>, which include custom made special attacks, passive effects etc.</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Carefully constructed drop rates</span>.</li>
<li>Balanced, <span class="bbcode-b">less Pay to Win</span> economy</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">NPC Factioning</span>.</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Daily events</span>.</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Very frequent updates</span> bringing loads of new content to the table</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">The BRUTALITY Waves</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Spire is different.  You will know this the second you log in and try the starter weapons.<br>
We focus on bringing innovation and new ideas to the table, while keeping things balanced and vanilla.<br>
None of our content is “half-assed”, and as the main coder I enjoy what I do.<br>
Oh yeah, and all the weapons that didn’t work in other RSPS’ such as the Royal Crossbow’s bleed effect?  Yeah we have those too.<br>
We’re hosted on a virtual Cloud, meaning 24/7 uptime with no lag.</p>
<p>We consider all player ideas, and welcome player creativity to help us create more, and better content.<br>
Players may not donate for overpowered things such as Torva sets, cash, xp, or death-touched darts.  This keeps the Eco balanced, and PvM/Skilling worth it.[/center]<br>
[center]<br>
For the PvM Enthusiasts<br>
[spoiler]Every custom boss brings something new to the table.  I invest lots of time into creating powerful and balanced bosses that are as fun as they are challenging.<br>
Drops are very well balanced, keeping items valuable and making all bosses worth killing.  High level custom bosses are fair, but punishing, and players are left with a sense<br>
of pride when they overcome them.  [/spoiler]</p>
<p>For the Skillers<br>
[spoiler]Skills are useful, profitable, and provide many benefits in and out of combat.  Upgrading armour with scrap metal from the chaotic rapier that you earned provides an interesting<br>
customizable mechanic to the game and encourages players to do more than just smack General Graardor in the face.  Cosmetics line shops for you to make your skilling pure as kaiwaii as can be.[/spoiler]</p>
<p>For the PKers<br>
[spoiler]You bathe in the virtual blood of your foes.  You bring down opponents by making use of axe, dagger, bow and spell.  You are a battle-hardened veteran who’s collected the loot of countless foes.  You have lots of skill and lots to teach.  This is a feeling I myself know all too well, and because of that I strive to make Spire’s PvP as enjoyable, balanced and hardcore as possible.[/spoiler]</p>
<p>For the Completionist<br>
[spoiler]You’ve traveled server to server.  You’re a hardened RSPS veteran who’s accomplished so much in so little time, the person that that players look up to for guidance and inspiration.  You’ve hunted players, monsters, and the poor unsuspecting iron ore.  You’ve quested, killed, skilled and probably even found a way to gain XP while showering.  Spire is yet another challenge, and one that you’re more than confident you can overcome.  Whether this is the server that you chose to settle in, or just one of many conquests, we know for sure you’ll enjoy your time here.[/spoiler][/center]</p>
