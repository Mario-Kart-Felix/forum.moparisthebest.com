    <title>Unidentified Network</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unidentified-network/426240</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I`m currently on my mobile phone so I`m gonna try and keep this thread short and to the point.

I`m staying at a Hotel in North Carolina at the moment and when I attempt to connect to there unsecured internet wifi a box pops up saying the connection was unsuccessful &quot;this computer currently has limited connectivity to *hotelsinternet*.&quot;

Then, when I hover over the wifi connection bar at the bottom right, it has a caution triangle over it and its showing all 4 bars but it says &quot;unidentified network&quot; &quot;no internet access&quot;.
Not only that but it shows that its recieving packets but were not sending any? 

im not a tech wiz at all when it comes to this so any detailed explanation would be very nice and appreciated. 
I would go to google for this but as I said im on my mobile which makes it very difficult.</description>

<p>Like open the browser &gt; Get redirected to their sign in page &gt; Log in &gt; Can use internet for period of time.</p>
