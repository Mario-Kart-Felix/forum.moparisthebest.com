    <title>[PI] - Run.Bat Problems For Win7 Users? (Please Help)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-run-bat-problems-for-win7-users-please-help/390947</link>
    <description>Hi , Iv&#39;e made a post about this earlier but no one even gave me a reasonable reply.



So I&#39;m re-making this.
Basicly, what my problem is, I have my server up and running, 2 of my friends log in, using WINDOWS 7 With no problem at ALL! In the client they used the Win7 Run.Bat, everything went smooth. Off to the real problem.

Now, I have 2 other friends that use Windows 7  as WELL!
Friend #1: His PC can&#39;t start the Run.bat up.(I have tried to give him numerous Run.bats!)

Friend #2: His PC loads the client, but when he tries to logon, it says, &quot;Error Connecting To Server&quot;.

WHAT THE HELL?

Now, I don&#39;t know much about this 32-Bit and 64-Bit shit, But I do remember that some Windows 7 PC&#39;s use either one, depending if they have a Home Premium, or Ultimate.

I am guessing my other 2 friends use 64-Bit Windows 7 PC&#39;s

The friends that are having problems are using 32-Bit Windows 7 PC&#39;s

I will paste the Windows 7 Run.bats My 2 friends that had gotten onto the client and logged in with the 2 friends that used them, and came up with problems!

NOTE: This is A PI SERVER!
BELOW!:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Windows 7 Run.Bat (Remember, 2 friends used this with no prob, 2 used this with a problem!


[code=javascript]@echo off
title Client
&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre6\bin\java.exe&quot; -Xmx500m Gui 30 0 lowmem members 32
pause

[/code]

PLEASE Help Me out AND my 2 friends, they really want to play, and if someone solved this, I think it would be A help to ANYONE that has this problem!

Again... Thank you!

P.S: Please don&#39;t give me any crap about, &quot;Oh did you change the IP in the client?&quot;
Ofcourse I did if 2 friends had already gotten on...

P.S#2: If you want to see pictures, I will gladly post them in time, just depends when I get back in contact with my friends.

P.S#3: EVERYTHING is fine except this Windows 7 problem, and since the damn majority of the U.S uses crappy ass Vista PC&#39;s and Windows 7, I am basicly screwed to having a nice RSPS community on my Server.

Thanks :P
