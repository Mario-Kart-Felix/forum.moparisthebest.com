    <description>Given time, no political ideology, whether singular or mixed in with others, can work for the human society. Throughout the course of human history, we have learned through some long, painful paths taken, that no matter what approach we have for a government, that there is not one that has worked effectively. Even today, with the democratic approach, we are running into complications with overpopulation and whatnot.</description>

              <p>USSR did nothing wrong by not dissolving it selves, you have to protect the ideology and only move forward to communism when it make sense.</p>
<p>By no time during it existence would it make sense in my eyes to move towards the goal (Communism), because of internal problems, WWII and the cold war. And I don’t think there is many that think that communism survived Stalin’s death, and other would say that Stalin killed it. So past 1953 Marxist-leninism was degrading in Russia.</p>
<p>And please prove to me that the human nature could not change.</p>
<p>There is five reasons why I would get rid of capitalism.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It isn’t sustainable, if everyone where to consume as much as us, we would need a couple of new planets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equality, capitalism helps to make the different bigger, and make it accumulate from generation to generation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficiency, we could avoid any waste, as it isn’t necessary to take the simplest solution when there is no competition, but rather take the environment and people into account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Democracy, by taking control over companies and nature resources, the democracy would have full power and not have to abide by the commands of big companies. So lobbying would no longer be such a problems. There would also be fewer interests, so everyone is working towards the same goal, and not benefits to a small segment of the population. (Tax-breaks).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It could limit wars and crimes. By having a non-greed based society, this could also influence the foreign policies. And since everyone would have their needs fulfilled, you could get rid of a big chunk of crime.</p>
</li>

<p>Look at the so called communist countries, and you will see the big flaw in the story. And I’m sure you have heard of corruption. If there was hunger, but much food, those who were hungry could get themselves food in an easy way. And It seems that the law about giving food to the community wasn’t forcefully enforced, since then they would enforce the production of food.</p>
<p>Ask Mao what he will say about your story, and I bet he would tell you that the settlers had the wrong mindset.</p>
<p>I do not however support the idea of communism today, because it lack the amount of control that I think is necessary. But it all really depends on where you define the transition between socialism and communism.</p>
<p>Anyway, US doesn’t work, because of all the people that died in the colonization of the continent.</p>

<p>Although I must admit I didn’t do a thourough search, I can’t seem to find any source that supports the story in that article.</p>
<p>I did find another reason the settlers died, although its source is Wikipedia, the story itself sounds quite plausible:</p>
<blockquote>It soon became apparent why the Virginia Indians did not occupy the site, and the inhospitable conditions severely challenged the settlers. Jamestown Island is a swampy area, and furthermore, it was isolated from most potential hunting game such as deer and bears which like to forage over much larger areas. The settlers quickly hunted and killed off all the large and smaller game that was to be found on the tiny peninsula. The low, marshy area was infested with mosquitoes (which carried malaria which killed over 135 settlers) and other airborne pests, and the brackish water of the tidal James River was not a good source of water. Many settlers died from drinking untreated water.
The settlers who came over on the initial three ships were not well-equipped for the life they found in Jamestown. In addition to the "gentlemen", who were not accustomed to manual or skilled labor, they consisted mainly of English laborers.[5] Many suffered from saltwater poisoning which led to infection, fevers and dysentery. As a result of these conditions, most of the early settlers died of disease and starvation.</blockquote>
<p>So the main cause of their demise wasn’t ‘Communism’, but a lack of game, malaria and other diseases, and drinking salt water.</p>
<p>I’m not an advocate of Communism, because I too believe it doesn’t work. But the constant ungrounded bashing of anything close to Socialism/Communism with an air of superiority (while your nation is close to it’s own downfall because of its political/economical system) is plain stupid.</p>

If United States didn’t attack the ideology for decades, we could actually have a decent form of it today. Communism isn’t USSR and it isn’t China or North Korea. So please explain to me what in the theory of communism, of the Marxism based theories,  that has proven to be shit, and hasn’t been corrected in the further development of the theory.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>So you are saying that the United States being anti-communism had a direct effect on how communist countries, like the USSR, worked internally?  That’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve heard in quite a long time.  Communist countries have failed, and will always fail, due to the nature of mankind.[/quote]<br>
No, but the propaganda that US stands for all good, and socialism and communism is all bad, might trick away people from the theory and prevent it for developing. I don’t say the perfect formula is found yet, but the most  ridiculous thing to say is that is it will always fail due to nature of mankind.</p>
<p>Btw, I like your checks and balance, between corrupt politicians and companies. I do however agree with you, checks and balance is important so why don’t implement it?</p>
<p>Lenin, Stalin and Mao did at least try to make things better. The politicians in US try to deny the population health care and are attacking the middle class just so the rich can get richer.</p>

<p>So you are saying that the United States being anti-communism had a direct effect on how communist countries, like the USSR, worked internally?  That’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve heard in quite a long time.  Communist countries have failed, and will always fail, due to the nature of mankind.  If you put someone in absolute power over other people, without any checks or balances, they will take advantage for themselves to the detriment of the public.</p>

The point I wanted to make with that quote is that many people are looking at the best of capitalism, and comparing it with the worst of socialism.</p>
<p>And btw, how are living standards in China and India now? Growth alone isn’t a measure of success.</p>
<p>Funny that you only mention big countries, let us see if it works with other countries than the big ones, and the west’s beloved ones.</p>
