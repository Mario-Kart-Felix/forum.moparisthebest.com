Without Desires and Greed, an Economy would fail to exist. So they kind of have to be part of every society.</p>

<p>Although I must admit I didn’t do a thourough search, I can’t seem to find any source that supports the story in that article.</p>
<p>I did find another reason the settlers died, although its source is Wikipedia, the story itself sounds quite plausible:</p>
<blockquote>It soon became apparent why the Virginia Indians did not occupy the site, and the inhospitable conditions severely challenged the settlers. Jamestown Island is a swampy area, and furthermore, it was isolated from most potential hunting game such as deer and bears which like to forage over much larger areas. The settlers quickly hunted and killed off all the large and smaller game that was to be found on the tiny peninsula. The low, marshy area was infested with mosquitoes (which carried malaria which killed over 135 settlers) and other airborne pests, and the brackish water of the tidal James River was not a good source of water. Many settlers died from drinking untreated water.
The settlers who came over on the initial three ships were not well-equipped for the life they found in Jamestown. In addition to the "gentlemen", who were not accustomed to manual or skilled labor, they consisted mainly of English laborers.[5] Many suffered from saltwater poisoning which led to infection, fevers and dysentery. As a result of these conditions, most of the early settlers died of disease and starvation.</blockquote>
<p>So the main cause of their demise wasn’t ‘Communism’, but a lack of game, malaria and other diseases, and drinking salt water.</p>
<p>I’m not an advocate of Communism, because I too believe it doesn’t work. But the constant ungrounded bashing of anything close to Socialism/Communism with an air of superiority (while your nation is close to it’s own downfall because of its political/economical system) is plain stupid.</p>

        <p>m1lkman: The people in power doesn’t like communism, because it does not benefit them or the people who have bought them. So it isn’t weird that they would blame this on communism.</p>
<p>Look at the so called communist countries, and you will see the big flaw in the story. And I’m sure you have heard of corruption. If there was hunger, but much food, those who were hungry could get themselves food in an easy way. And It seems that the law about giving food to the community wasn’t forcefully enforced, since then they would enforce the production of food.</p>
<p>Ask Mao what he will say about your story, and I bet he would tell you that the settlers had the wrong mindset.</p>
<p>I do not however support the idea of communism today, because it lack the amount of control that I think is necessary. But it all really depends on where you define the transition between socialism and communism.</p>
<p>Anyway, US doesn’t work, because of all the people that died in the colonization of the continent.</p>

        <p>It’s human nature to think about me me me me. It may work in a small little community with 20+ people but when thousands upon thousands become involved it won’t work. You will always have those bad apples that corrupt the other bad apples. It’s kind of the same way with bots in runescape. People want to get ahead of others by cheating and not doing the work. When I see others are cheating to get ahead of me, I want to cheat to keep up. Same applies with communism.</p>
<p>Wasn’t Russia supposed to be a marxist country? The government was supposed to dissolve once everyone was happy but human nature won’t allow it. It’s idealistic, not realistic.</p>

        <p>USSR did nothing wrong by not dissolving it selves, you have to protect the ideology and only move forward to communism when it make sense.</p>
<p>By no time during it existence would it make sense in my eyes to move towards the goal (Communism), because of internal problems, WWII and the cold war. And I don’t think there is many that think that communism survived Stalin’s death, and other would say that Stalin killed it. So past 1953 Marxist-leninism was degrading in Russia.</p>
<p>And please prove to me that the human nature could not change.</p>
<p>There is five reasons why I would get rid of capitalism.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It isn’t sustainable, if everyone where to consume as much as us, we would need a couple of new planets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equality, capitalism helps to make the different bigger, and make it accumulate from generation to generation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficiency, we could avoid any waste, as it isn’t necessary to take the simplest solution when there is no competition, but rather take the environment and people into account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Democracy, by taking control over companies and nature resources, the democracy would have full power and not have to abide by the commands of big companies. So lobbying would no longer be such a problems. There would also be fewer interests, so everyone is working towards the same goal, and not benefits to a small segment of the population. (Tax-breaks).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It could limit wars and crimes. By having a non-greed based society, this could also influence the foreign policies. And since everyone would have their needs fulfilled, you could get rid of a big chunk of crime.</p>
</li>
