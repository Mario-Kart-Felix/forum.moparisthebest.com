              <p>what source Build and client Build are you using ?<br>
317<br>
508<br>
614<br>
etc…<br>
also im not good with networks and all that crap but it might be connection problem…<br>
use the ip 127.0.0.1 on the client on the machine you are running the server on at the same time if you can connect you probly need to portforward assuming you are using a diffrent machine then the one the server is running on (i think it might not matter being on diffrent one or not i dont know using your ip may make it leave the network and need a portforward anyways your gonna wanna portforward no matter what if you havent yet) (portforward and use rune locus to check the status of your server) these are problems it could be (not all of them) based on what you have given me (not much) sorry if i didnt help but atleast i bumped your post</p>
