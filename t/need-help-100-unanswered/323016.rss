    <description>Ok so i am using the zombie-scape source. If you try and wear items (even if u have stat requirements) it wont let you. It&#39;s not that you dont have requirements met but its just weird that u cant wear. The coder of the server did say in his post in download section he broke the cache and u have to code in the items urself but how do you do that? please help</description>

<p>Ummmm yeah. I forgot to mention that. I ah broke the cache by accident and Runescape items dont work unless u manually code them in the server. There is an example of how at the top of potions.java case 1265.</p>

</aside>
<p>that is what the person who posted in the download section said so if u can tell me what he means and how to do</p>

              <p>It might be in item.java.</p>
<p>Thats probably what he meant by ‘code’ them all by yourself.<br>
But, that also has nothing to do with the cache. You might need to just get a new client and transfer the models and Class8.java and class46.java</p>
<p>Other than that, i’m not sure. I don’t think there is a cache in the server side files. But i’m not 100% sure.</p>
