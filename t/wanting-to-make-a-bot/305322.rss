<p>Why would anybody make you a step by step guide? They might as well make their own bot and rake in the ad money.</p>
<p>Start learning java via <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/</a> and go from there.</p>

<p>seems like you have no moparisthebest experience whatsoever. There isn’t a step-by-step manual that holds your hands and guides you through the process - you shouldn’t start with such a project if you have zero experience.[/quote]<br>
Did you even read what he said?</p>
<p>assuming you didn’t, how do you get experience without starting a project involving the subject you require experience in?</p>
