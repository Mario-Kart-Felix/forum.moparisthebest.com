    <title>Need help on propper ip bans!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-on-propper-ip-bans/54075</link>
    <description>You see i&#39;ve been trying to get ip banns now for 3 weeks!... this is wat i&#39;ve been told....

#1. Go to characters, click their name, copy their last connection:... and paste it into BannedIps.
That doesn&#39;t work, because people can get on different accounts, E.G
I ip ban someone thats advertising. they just come on a different account and keep on spamming.

#2. I&#39;ve also been told to, type ::checkip, or ::ipcheck, or somet like that, and that didn&#39;t work because it&#39;s exactly the same as last connection.

So that didn&#39;t work -.-!

#3. i have read the tut, followed that.... GUESS WOT! it didn&#39;t work...

SO PLEASE... SOMEONE TELL ME HOW TO IP BAN PROPERLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :mad: :mad: :mad:</description>
