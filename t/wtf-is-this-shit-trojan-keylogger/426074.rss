    <title>Wtf is this shit? [Trojan, Keylogger?]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wtf-is-this-shit-trojan-keylogger/426074</link>
    <description>Hey all I was playing on a rsps server I like, Then random a screen pops up with a guy named anonymous asking me something about a blue screen (That was a prank code witch I was busy with). Then I said (It was a interface chatbox witch I couldnt move or click away) Wtf, Who ru. And he said that he is a hacker but he didnt want to harm me, He just maded a mistake in Ip&#39;s. Then I asked him how he did it and what program is infected on my computer and he said that he cant tell how he did it but he said &quot;I didnt infect u with a virus or shit, I send your IP packets with a program called &quot;blackshades RAT&quot; and that he will leave me alone now and he will remove me from his IP list. The chat closed and I was like.. WTF. 

He was very nice to.. He even said sorry :/ He also said he was from &quot;anonymous&quot;. (Not that I belive it..)

Scanned my computer and nothing came up
Any idea how this could have happen?  :confused:</description>

Anonymous is a set of ideas, you can believe in it and take action on it’s grounds, but you can’t be a member of it. That would like being a member of “happy”. It’s impossible.</p>

<p>Anonymous is a group of people (Me included) that believe that the internet should be a ‘free’ place, and piracy should not be illegal. you never know who they are (damn, half this site could be), you cant stop them, thus the name anonymous. Sadly some people hack to show this (Hacktivists) and some protest (all that <span class="hashtag">#occupy-wallstreet</span> shit)</p>
<p>//EDIT: ANON dosnt have a building (LMFAO) but thay do have a site:<br>

LOL java “viruses” are usually located randomly at different areas in the file package. Plus it’s not only RSPS, you can get infected from any kind of JAR, batch, cmd, or document that is associated with java. So you either need to be an expert at java, or download ONLY trusted servers. Your friends (if they don’t make their own source) could download a server base and infect you anyways with someone else’s virus. I’d suggest to the OP to not touch your computer anymore and send it in to a company that specializes in fixing computers and securing them.</p>

This is so simple, obviously the kid downloaded a RAT or a Trojan off the Internet and didn’t have a firewall. Therefore the attacker can do whatever they want to the computer even if you think you’ve removed the “virus”. No hacker makes mistakes in IP’s, they all hack to harm people just cause. Your info and has probably been stolen, i’d take a look at your bank/site accounts if i were you. To remove this i just recommend re-installing your operating system. I guarantee the virus has been embedded into your system already.<br>

<p>your right, in ‘Hacking’, there is no way in hell that you can mistake ip’s…he said he was playing a rsps…maby that rsps packed a virus into their cache, then when it extracted the cache, it extracted the virus too…[/quote]</p>
<p>He can have a virus execute when a method is used in the java code, then he can jar it as his webclient then people run it and get infected if its fully undetectable.</p>
