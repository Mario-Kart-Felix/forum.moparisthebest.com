              <p>They are hard to stop as the bot itslef uses other peoples IP’s as its own so that can be stoped unless you do 1 ip per login, But then it can use proxys, and as for name they don’t just have to use the name SYIPKER they can use anything they like, the last one that spammed my server was called adobe1, adobe2 ect…</p>

Urm… but yer to help gainstt mass flooding just do what he said above.<br>
But if someone was to ddos you it wouldn’t be just 1 IP it would be several IP’s if not hundreds all attacking you at once.</p>

<p>He is talking about SYI attacks. The one connection per IP would work for some SYI’s but some other versions of SYI can read IP’s already connected to the server and mask itself with those IP’s making the IP ban useless and maybe pissing off innocent people.</p>
