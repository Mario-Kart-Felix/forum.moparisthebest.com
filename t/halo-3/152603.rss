    <title>Halo 3</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/halo-3/152603</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve seen a couple of topics with odds and ends in them about Halo 3, but no real discussion.

I don&#39;t think this goes in discussions because its more than that, but if a mod sees fit you can move it.

I personally do not have an XBox360, but on my break of life, I hopped on a bus and went to my friends house with a different friend of mine. I played Halo 3 for about an hour on some shit called Forge. We faught, and even though I&#39;ve never had any type of XBox, I did pretty good. I was winning until he decided the little flying ball thingy and flinging cars with telekinesis was a fun idea..

Anyhow the weapons are fun, I like the vehicles, and the overall game play was awesome. I&#39;ll be saving up for a 360 and all the Halo Games for a big&#39;ol week of fun :)</description>

<p>Campaign was beautifully made, though the characters really looked like crap.  Possibly no better than in Halo 2.  But the way they set it up, with the skulls… that was a stroke of genius.  And I’m loving my full Hayabusa.</p>
<p>The Spartan laser is a blast to use, especially because no one picks it up because they suck with it.  I got this awesome shot off with the laser that I gotta show you guys… I was definitely host that game lol.</p>
<p>They put a lot of effort into balancing the game.  Especially the small things.  Plasma pistol disables vehicles temporarily… that’s simply genius.  Though I’m disappointed at the sword shit.  In swords, I could be lunging at this person several times, but we cancel each other out, leaving our shields at zero, only for someone to clean both of us up with a frag.  It’s pathetic and definitely needs to be removed.</p>

              <p>Forge is a real let down considering they were going “Now you can design your own whole maps and share with other people!” Well tbh all you can do is drop random items, vehicles and weapons everywhere. You can’t build walls or delete original parts of the map.</p>
