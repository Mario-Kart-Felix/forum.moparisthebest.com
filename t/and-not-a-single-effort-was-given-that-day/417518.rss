Yeah I know I&#39;m back againone might say, pulling an &quot;h1&quot;.
But I have reason. Apparently, I&#39;m suffering from some sort of depression that makes me feel useless and unneeded, on and off. This has caused me to do a lot of things I probably didn&#39;t want, but I&#39;ll try and talk myself out of quitting anything from now on.

On with the model, the poly count is just so ungodly overkilled that if I showed you, you would quite possibly develop testicular cancer, regardless of gender.
After 5 useful suggestions on improvement I&#39;ll post a new picture (rather than every single suggestion.)

Oh, and I didn&#39;t use nurbs.
