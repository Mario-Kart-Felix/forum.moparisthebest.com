    <title>[PI/DSPK] Memory Issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-dspk-memory-issue/411169</link>
    <description>I keep having the same issue when host this server for some friends, when a large number of players are on there&#39;s a chance that everyone will DC, but some their characters will remain logged in and they can&#39;t relog until a restart.  Basically, when a large amount of people are on, the character files start to fuck themselves.
