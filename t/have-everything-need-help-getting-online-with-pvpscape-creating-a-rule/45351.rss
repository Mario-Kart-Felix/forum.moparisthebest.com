    <title>Have Everything, Need Help Getting Online With PVPscape - creating a rule</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/have-everything-need-help-getting-online-with-pvpscape-creating-a-rule/45351</link>
    <description>I have the PVPscape source, everything with the server itself is a-ok. I just need assistance creating a rule into my router, i use sbcglobal wireless internet, please don&#39;t just tell me to go to the ultimate server guide, i&#39;ve read it, not helping. All that does is tell me to type in my ip-adress. 1st off - where am i supposed to type it?...the url i know, anyone can draw this from common sense. So i go into my iternet setting and find my ip-adress, type it into the url, and what do i get? A page cannot be found message, you know one of those really annoying white screens with a bunch of white text? If anyone can go into greater detail and help me get my server online, there is an admin position on my &quot;hopefully soon to be up&quot; server. 

Thanks</description>
