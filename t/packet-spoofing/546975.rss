    <title>Packet Spoofing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/packet-spoofing/546975</link>
    <description>Does anybody know about spoofing packets? For example, using python to write a script that sends out packets with a fake origin IP address?

Just wondering if anybody has any experience with implementing such things. Just looking for the Mopar-perspective.</description>

              <p>The only way i know of that you could “spoof” an IP address is to use a Proxy server. (A server that will resend the data you send to it to its “real” destination. Therefore marking the proxy as the origin. Then any response sent back to the proxy could be ignored, or forwarded to you (meaning a log would still reveal your location). If you purchased and set up the proxy yourself, then you could be found through the domain owner of the Proxy’s IP.<br>
So if you plan on doing anything illegal through these means, I suggest you rethink it.</p>

Also layer 2 is the hardware layer, but the IP layer is layer 3. Layer 2 spoofing is always a possibility yes, but your location is determined by your IP. The communication is established at layer 2, (all that is needed for a single network’s connection) but if you want it to extend into the “internet” you will have to modify layer 3.</p>

<p>I think the IP that their isp would send to the server is the IP your ISP know’s you as, as is from the “inside” of your network (lan) you have no way of knowing what your IP is (ISP -name for-&gt; YOU).<br>
Because At your local networks level, You don’t know what your IP is, unless you use something like <a href="http://whatismyip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">whatismyip.com</a> You know your local IP is (192.168.<em>.</em>) and know your router’s IP is 192.168.1.1(typically), well if you know the basic network system, you know ARP, DNS, RARP and how they are used in the routing of data. Well the Network above your local network has the same protocol as far as finding a target as your network does.</p>
<p>The only way to do it would be to tell your ISP “call me this IP” so it would be able to lie about it on the forward packet, unless you modified their system :\ For practical purposes i would say this is out of the question. But would still be possible if you had the knowhow.</p>

<p>Just wondering if anybody has any experience with implementing such things. Just looking for the Mopar-perspective.<br>
[/quote]I don’t believe it’s possible to do practically. There’s a handshake process that needs to communicate between both parties (your IP and the server’s). If you’re spoofing your IP, it’s not going to be able to perform a handshake (with TCP anyway).</p>
<p>May I ask what you’re doing this for? There might be another solution.[/quote]<br>
If you were to send a packet with a fake location it would be impossible to get a response.</p>
<p>The address the host attempts to validate will be from the direction of your in town’s network switch to your home.<br>
The transaction would be you telling your router to send a packet to DEST.<br>
Your router would read the header of your packet. Then depending on the IP of the packet, it runs an algorithm that tells it the direction to the DEST.<br>
First modifying the hardware level addresses, to the next destinations MAC, and the from’s MAC to its MAC address.<br>
MAC_FROM = MAC_MINE<br>
MAC_DEST = MAC_NEXT<br>
Your router realises the IP is not on your network, and sends it to your ISP. (Your router’s default gateway)<br>
The ISP router reads the incoming frame.<br>
The ISP router then reads the header, then determines if it knows where the DEST IP is.<br>
IF it does know it sends the frame in that direction.<br>
IF it does not know, it sends out an ARP request to determine if any sibling node knows where the DEST IP is, then repeat the same process your ISP’s router did.</p>

<p>I may not know a lick about python or really what you’re doing. But I think it’d be really neat to see regardless.

<pre><code class="lang-auto">NAME
       tcpflow - TCP flow recorder

SYNOPSIS
       tcpflow [-aBcCDhpsvVZ] [-b max_bytes] [-d debug_level] [-[eE] scanner] [-f max_fds] [-F[ctTXMkmg]] [-i iface] [-L semlock]
       [-m min_bytes] [-o outdir] [-r file1.pcap] [-R file0.pcap] [-Sname=value] [-T[filename template]] [-wfile] [-x scanner]
       [-X file.xml] [expression]

DESCRIPTION
       tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is
       convenient for protocol analysis or debugging.  Rather than showing packet-by-packet information, tcpflow reconstructs the
       actual data streams and stores each flow in a separate file for later analysis.  tcpflow understands TCP sequence numbers and
       will correctly reconstruct data streams regardless of retransmissions or out-of-order delivery. tcpflow provides control over
       filenames for automatic binning of connections by protocol, IP adress or connection number, and has a sophisticated plug-in
       system for decompressing compressed HTTP connections, undoing MIME encoding, or calling user-provided programs for post-pro‐
       cessing.

       By default tcpflow stores all captured data in files that have names of the form:

            192.168.101.102.02345-010.011.012.013.45103

       ...where the contents of the above file would be data transmitted from host 192.168.101.102 port 2345, to host 10.11.12.13
       port 45103.</code></pre>

<p>Just wondering if anybody has any experience with implementing such things. Just looking for the Mopar-perspective.[/quote]I don’t believe it’s possible to do practically. There’s a handshake process that needs to communicate between both parties (your IP and the server’s). If you’re spoofing your IP, it’s not going to be able to perform a handshake (with TCP anyway).</p>
<p>May I ask what you’re doing this for? There might be another solution.</p>

              <p>I don’t think you can fake the origin IP address, can you? Not without a proxy at least. Doesn’t that just come through the network trace?</p>
