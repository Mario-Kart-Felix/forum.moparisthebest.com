    <title>How can I make potions work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-can-i-make-potions-work/183001</link>
    <description>Yeah how? No, not herblore. I want to when you drink a potion, you will get some stats up. And they would go lower after some time. Help?

I got another question too, how can I make people can&#39;t log out during combat? Because like in wilderness, they&#39;re teleblocked and unable to move, they just log out. How can I change it?</description>

              <p>Ok basically first off you would need to create a timer. And you would also want to make a boolean to say if your using  str pot or not</p>
<p><code>public int strTimer = 0;
public boolean usingStrPot = false;</code></p>
<p>paste that into where your booleans are</p>
<p>k now you need to create the actual code to make the strength go down after some time</p>
<p>[code]if (usingStrPot == true &amp;&amp; strTimer = 0) {<br>
if (playerLevel[2] &gt; getLevelForXP(playerXP[2]) {<br>
playerLevel[2] = (playerLevel[2] - 1);<br>
strTimer = 70;<br>
} else {<br>
usingStrPot == false;<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p>[/code]</p>
<p>Ok, that basically means “if the players using a strength pot and his strength is over the level he should have for the amount of exp he has then the players new strength level is his current strength level - 1(decreasing strength level slowly).” It then sets the timer back to 70 so it has to count down again and do the same code when timer = 0</p>
<p>Now, we need to make the str pot actually initialize that code when its drunk.</p>
<p><code>case 113:
usingStrPot = true;
strTimer = 70;
abc = getLevelForXP(playerXP[2]);
cba = abc / 10;
aaa = cba / 2;
abc2 = aaa + cba;
if (abc2 &lt;= 1) {
abc2 = 2;
}
playerLevel[2] = getLevelForXP(playerXP[2]);
playerLevel[2] += abc2;
sendFrame126(""+playerLevel[2]+"", 4006);
deleteItem(113, GetItemSlot(113), 1);
addItem(115, 1);
updateRequired = true;
appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
GoOn = false;
break;</code></p>
<p>That initializes the code and starts the timer and increases your strength.<br>
Paste that below any of the cases in your client.java<br>
Hope it helps.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">WARNING: </span> i havent tested this code. I just wrote this code for you. Please backup your client.java before using this code becausei will not accept responsibilty for any errors that may occur.</p>
