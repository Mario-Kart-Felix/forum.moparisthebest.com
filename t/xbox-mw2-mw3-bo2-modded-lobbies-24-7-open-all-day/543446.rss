<p>My day was back in about 2009-2010, not sure about any advances in the field since then.</p>

</aside>
<p>There are now Bypass for it, also you still need a Kv but with a Bypass you can stay online for like 2-7days.<br>
And Kvs are cheap now, In 2010-2012 its was like $40+ for a Kv.<br>
Only its sucks that you need to pay Everyday $20 if you wanna host online. but i have Lifetime, Only what i need to buy everytime is a Kv.</p>

</aside>
<p>Ahh I see, about time they got one out lol. I’m surprised they haven’t cracked down on KV’s though, I thought they’d be blacklisted sooner rather than later. If you got one for $40 it was probably already highlighted for takedown, we used to spend between $70 and $100 just to stay online for at most an hour or so. We made triple, sometimes quadruple that back in money though. I’m not sure if you can still 10th prestige with all weapon/award/badge unlocks but that’s what we used to offer. 10$ to get your shit and go, $20 if you wanna stick around for 10 minutes and $50 if you wanted the whole lobby with 5 invites to your friends. We used to make honestly about 350-400$ per lobby on a decent day.</p>
<p>Is it still good money?</p>
<p>Also are they still the same motherboards in use? Xenon, Falcon, Zephyr, Jasper and I think the other one was Opus. Or have there been more modified?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yea we still can do  UnlockAll and stuff Like that, its still the same price. ( Also Invissable Classes/GodMode ) That will stuck on your accound.<br>
I make In 2days like $50+ But sometimes i just host for free because im bored, Im trying to Learn C# to make My own Tools and stuff Peoples Making Mod Menu and Sell them for $30. And I have a RGH Corona That is the new one. But most of peoples have Trinity or Jasper because its Cheaper i think lol.<br>
If you want to join a Free Lobby just message me on Skype: Msql Hoster<br>
Also if you know Something from C# maybe you can help me with it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/blush.png?v=5" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"><br>
[/quote]<br>
Ahh I see. 50$ every couple days isn’t bad if your KV is lasting you a week I suppose. I’ve still got my old Xenon around here somewhere, I’ll maybe look it out one day and host just for the luls. Jasper used to be like second most expensive next to Zephyr. I dunno if I even have any of these new games lying around for xbox lol, I play PC games mainly now. If I find one of them and get my xbox up and running I’ll shoot you a message for old times sake <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I don’t know any C#, sorry. It won’t be too hard to pick up the basics though, the syntax is pretty much identical to Java so if you’ve messed around with RSPS you’ll have seen something a bit similar if nothing else.[/quote]<br>
Its okay. also i quited with RsPs, because ididnt like it anymore. I like Programing, but rsps is not my thing anymore.</p>

<p>There are now Bypass for it, also you still need a Kv but with a Bypass you can stay online for like 2-7days.<br>
And Kvs are cheap now, In 2010-2012 its was like $40+ for a Kv.<br>
Only its sucks that you need to pay Everyday $20 if you wanna host online. but i have Lifetime, Only what i need to buy everytime is a Kv.</p>

              <p>Do they still rush-ban KV’s? I remember back in my day I was lucky to last 45 minutes. Are KV’s even needed anymore or is there a bypass for them? You might have heard of my guys if you’re an old-timer - WaS x Patron, WaS x TDub, WaS x Snowcones etc, TL;DR a bunch of yanks with a lot of money + me. If I remember correctly, Patron was into GB etc, not sure if he’s still around.</p>

Doesn’t look like any of them do modding and hacking anymore, Patron’s pretty fucking high ranked, too. 170k profile views seems like a lot plus 30th MLG rank doesn’t seem bad lol.</p>
