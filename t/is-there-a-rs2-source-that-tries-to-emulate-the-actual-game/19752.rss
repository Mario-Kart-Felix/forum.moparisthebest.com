    <title>Is there a RS2 Source that tries to emulate the actual game?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-there-a-rs2-source-that-tries-to-emulate-the-actual-game/19752</link>
    <description>Most people seem to be going for a Runescape remix.. I just want an emulated RS2 or RSC (preferably RSC but meh.. its in production) 

Yeah, I wanna make it my own server, because people love to steal all your &amp;$@*&amp; items on the real Jagex version of RS2. Java is easy to hack as it is...

So, I just want to know if there is a server source that acts like RS2.. without all the annoying added in &quot;fresh ideas&quot; that crash everything.. (example=Project 16&#39;s &quot;put everything for lv 100 and up in every city everywhere! muahaha!&quot;)

Though I doubt I get any answers, one would be appreciated.</description>

              <p>I didn’t really mean exactly… I can’t find a source that has the crafts coded and stuff like that, and testscape… errgh…</p>
<p>Sad thins is I’d feel more “at home” working on a RSC server… I never played RS2, so actually having a RS2 server is an entirely new feel, as well as I was never a member on RS… was allways free… I’ll keep searching…</p>
<p>Thus far the only one thats came remotely close to working and not crashing is Project 16V3.1… which is sad since V6 sucks … and uhh… theres all the stuff thrown in … everywhere…</p>

              <p>Well the only one that I know of is mine, but it is not nearly perfect, and there are a few codes, etc. Nothing big though. Mostly just stuff to teleport you places.</p>
<p>I suggest you start out with TestScape and work your way from there. That is what I did.</p>
