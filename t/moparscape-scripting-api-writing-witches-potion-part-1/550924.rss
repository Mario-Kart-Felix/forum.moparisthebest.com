Notes:

I have to review on how I want the conventions of quests to be done and I need to finish a lot of other helper methods involved with quests. This however is writing ALL of the dialogue involved with the quest and updating the quest stage after dialogue is finished. Most of the video will be fluff of me coding and talking about future prospects. Tomorrows video will be fleshing out the quest helper methods (removing the items from the inventory, checking if they are there, etc) along with proper naming of all the module methods. Background artist is Banks. 

Hope you enjoy! This took me 30 minutes which means on average we could finish a SIMPLE quest everyday if we put our minds to the effort and once its done once its done on all platforms using the same API.

Result script:

[code=lua]
local module = {}

module.one = function(plr)
    plr:dialogueplr(&quot;&lt;p,calm&gt;I am in search of a quest.&quot;)

Here are my notes used in the video:

[code]
Witches potion

&quot;I can start this quest by talking to &lt;red&gt;Hetty&lt;/red&gt; in her house in &lt;red&gt;Rimmington&lt;/red&gt;, West of &lt;red&gt;Port Sarim&lt;/red&gt;&quot;

- Talk to Hetty

&quot;&lt;p,quiz&gt;What could you want with an old woman like me?&quot;

Option -&gt;
&quot;I am in search of a quest.&quot; (0)
&quot;I&#39;ve heard that you are a witch.&quot; (1)

(0)
&quot;I am in search of a quest.&quot;
&quot;Hmmm... Maybe I can think of something for you.&quot;
&quot;Would you like to become proficient in the dark arts&quot;

Option -&gt;
&quot;Yes help me become one with my dark side.&quot; (2)
&quot;No I have my principle and honour.&quot; (3)
&quot;What, you mean improve my magic?&quot; (4)

(1)
&quot;I&#39;ve heard that you are a witch.&quot;
&quot;Yer it does seem to be getting fairly common knowledge.&quot;
&quot;I fear I may get a visit from the witch hunters of Falador before long.&quot;

(2)
&quot;Yes help me become one with my dark side.&quot;
(sub2)
&quot;Ok I&#39;m going to make a potion to help bring out your darker self.&quot;
&quot;You will need certain ingredients.&quot;
&quot;What do I need?&quot;
&quot;You need an eye of newt, a rat&#39;s tail, an onion... Oh and a piece of burnt meat.&quot;
&quot;Great I&#39;ll go get them.&quot;

(3)
&quot;No I have my principle and honour.&quot;
&quot;Suit yourself, but you&#39;re missing out.&quot;

(4)
&quot;What, you mean improve my magic?&quot;
&quot;The witch sighs.&quot;						Note: Standalone dialogue
&quot;Yes improve your magic...&quot;
&quot;Do you have no sense of drama?&quot;

Option -&gt;
&quot;Yes I&#39;d like to improve my magic.&quot; (5)
&quot;No I&#39;m not interested.&quot; (6)
&quot;Show me the mysteries of the dark arts...&quot; (7)

(5)
&quot;The witch signs.&quot;															Note: Standalone dialogue

&quot;Many aren&#39;t to start off with.&quot;
&quot;The witch smiles mysteriously.&quot; 	Note: Standalone dialogue
&quot;But I think you&#39;ll be drawn back to this place.&quot;

(7)
&quot;The witch smiles mysteriously.&quot;	Note: Standalone dialogue
goto sub2


&lt;blue&gt;Hetty needs me to bring the following:&lt;/blue&gt;&lt;p,red&gt;An onion&lt;p&gt;A rat&#39;s tail&lt;p&gt;A burnt piece of meat&lt;p&gt;An eye of newt&lt;/red&gt;

I have eye of newt in my inventory:

&lt;st&gt;I have an eye of newty&lt;/st&gt;

When I have all the items just strikes through each of them with the same message

After first stage:

&quot;I spoke to Hetty at her house at Rimmington. Hetty told me she could increase my magic powerif I can bring her certain ingredients for a potion.&quot;

&quot;So have you found the things for the potion?&quot;
&quot;I found some of the things you asked for:&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t have rats tail.&quot; http://prntscr.com/6q5s1o
&quot;Great, but I&#39;ll need the other ingredients as well.&quot;

&quot;So have you found the things for the potion?&quot;
&quot;Yes I have everything!&quot;
&quot;Excellent, can I have them?&quot;
http://prntscr.com/6q5scx
&quot;Well, is it ready?&quot;
&quot;Ok,now drink from the cauldron.&quot;

&quot;I should drink from the &lt;red&gt;cauldron&lt;/red&gt; and improve my magic!&quot;

<p>Notes:</p>
<p>I have to review on how I want the conventions of quests to be done and I need to finish a lot of other helper methods involved with quests. This however is writing ALL of the dialogue involved with the quest and updating the quest stage after dialogue is finished. Most of the video will be fluff of me coding and talking about future prospects. Tomorrows video will be fleshing out the quest helper methods (removing the items from the inventory, checking if they are there, etc) along with proper naming of all the module methods. Background artist is Banks.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy! This took me 30 minutes which means on average we could finish a SIMPLE quest everyday if we put our minds to the effort and once its done once its done on all platforms using the same API.</p>
<p>Result script:</p>

<p>Here are my notes used in the video:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Witches potion

"I can start this quest by talking to &lt;red&gt;Hetty&lt;/red&gt; in her house in &lt;red&gt;Rimmington&lt;/red&gt;, West of &lt;red&gt;Port Sarim&lt;/red&gt;"

- Talk to Hetty

"Yer it does seem to be getting fairly common knowledge."
"I fear I may get a visit from the witch hunters of Falador before long."

(2)
"Yes help me become one with my dark side."
(sub2)
"Ok I'm going to make a potion to help bring out your darker self."

&lt;blue&gt;Hetty needs me to bring the following:&lt;/blue&gt;&lt;p,red&gt;An onion&lt;p&gt;A rat's tail&lt;p&gt;A burnt piece of meat&lt;p&gt;An eye of newt&lt;/red&gt;

I have eye of newt in my inventory:

&lt;st&gt;I have an eye of newty&lt;/st&gt;

When I have all the items just strikes through each of them with the same message

After first stage:

"I spoke to Hetty at her house at Rimmington. Hetty told me she could increase my magic powerif I can bring her certain ingredients for a potion."

"So have you found the things for the potion?"
"I found some of the things you asked for:"
"I don't have rats tail." http://prntscr.com/6q5s1o
"Great, but I'll need the other ingredients as well."

"So have you found the things for the potion?"
"Yes I have everything!"
"Excellent, can I have them?"
http://prntscr.com/6q5scx
"Well, is it ready?"
"Ok,now drink from the cauldron."

"I should drink from the &lt;red&gt;cauldron&lt;/red&gt; and improve my magic!"
