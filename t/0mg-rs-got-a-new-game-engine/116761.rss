    <title>0MG! RS got a new game engine</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/0mg-rs-got-a-new-game-engine/116761</link>
    <description>This week we&#39;ve made another internal upgrade to the RuneScape game engine, which makes it possible for us to do more complex/varied updates in the future.

This time around the interface system has had another overhaul, with a large chunk of the system completely replaced with a more powerful version. We&#39;ve then had to adjust and retest all the old interfaces to make sure they still work under the new system (a big job!).

The sorts of changes that have been made aren&#39;t generally things that you&#39;ll notice immediately, but there&#39;s a surprisingly large amount of work involved in any engine upgrade. Admittedly, it&#39;s not the most exciting update in the short term, but it&#39;s definitely worth it in the long run!

All this frantic behind the scenes activity finally means we can now get started on some (much requested) updates to some of our main interfaces - updates which weren&#39;t previously possible, but now are! In the meantime, though, [b]we&#39;ve taken the opportunity to fix a few more bugs... [/b]

jagex blames their players for the bug misuse when they suck at coding..:P so they blame us lol</description>
