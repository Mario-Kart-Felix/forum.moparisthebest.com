    <description>When people lag out sometimes it lags the whole server until the server re-start happends or i force re-start it. I cant figure out what wrong. I am new to coding and this is one of the few things i yet cannot do. I have a diferent server i use for a backup running right now. I want to get the old one back running but it sometimes will cause people to lag out repeatedly without being able to stop. Sometimes nulling the server. Please if there is ANY advice u can give please.. share...</description>
