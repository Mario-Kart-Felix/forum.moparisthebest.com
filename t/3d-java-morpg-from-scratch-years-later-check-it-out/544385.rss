    <title>3D Java MORPG From Scratch.. Years Later *check it out*</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/3d-java-morpg-from-scratch-years-later-check-it-out/544385</link>
    <description>Welcome to the [b]Aeonlite 3D MORPG development thread[/b]. I plan on publishing here often, with updates, and in the future with website / client download links.

[b]Current Features:[/b]
[*]OpenGL rendering with stable ~60fps, even on my garbage laptop
[*]Performance mode option which effects most graphic settings (for people with garbage laptops)
[*]Auto walk to destination (click terrain with left mouse button)
[*]Distance based content processing/rendering
[*]Primitive mobile entity &quot;logic / ai&quot;
[*]Developer tools (cache packer, unpacker, etc)
[*]Left click interaction with the digital world (click to walk, click to interact with mob, click to pickup item, click to use prop)
[*]Mob texture recoloring on the fly..... (still needs a lot of revision to do what I need it to do, but it will happen, eventually..)
[*]Interface open / close via UI button clicking .. (but dialogue is the only functional interface at the moment)
[*]Multi player RENDERING - you can see other players and interact with them like a real game, but coordinates are client-sided, and could be exploited, but due to limited time I am keeping the design &quot;fun&quot; and do not care
[*]&quot;AI Player Bot&quot; which is basically a fake login that sends random packets such as walking around the map.. (to test multiplayer rendering)
[*]Static and dynamic game props are loaded from configuration files @ server startup, and the data is then sent to each client upon after logging in, and gets cached.... (I decided to store it server-sided so that I can use them for collision authentication in the future)

Old old photo of development, but it shows some custom made NPC models.. (fully animated)
[spoiler][img]http://i.imgur.com/7lciido.png[/img][/spoiler]

This project took 2-3 years of off and on programming here and there, with many large gaps in between out bursts due to encountering countless &quot;impossible&quot; complications during the initial development phase.. It is something that has been &quot;rebuilt 100 times already&quot; so be aware this thread will not be dramatically re-done anytime soon.. I waited to get to this point in development before I shared it on programming forums :cool:

[u]Some things I think should be mentioned before they are asked:[/u]

* Why come to moparscape with this?
I&#39;ve been active in the RSPS community since November 2006, however, in the past few years not so much.. as I started with 2D game development, and worked my way into 3D very slowly. I am back to share my &quot;masterpiece&quot; and most long term &quot;project&quot;, in the first forum that got me started with my programming journey.

* What game engine are you using?
None! I am using the jPCT 3D library for rendering, but it only goes as far as actually rendering models.. All game-related code, including the main loop, are all hand made by myself over the past couple of years.

* Why not use a game engine?
Where&#39;s the fun in that? I spent so much time (years) learning 3D mathematics and game design so that I could create a &quot;legal rsps&quot; style project for myself. Something long term I could devote my energy into and not worry about having any negative legal precautions.

* How do you fund the project?
Over the years I have had a handful of different &quot;investors&quot; over the years but eventually each one of them bailed on me, I assume because they didn&#39;t truly understand how much asset creation would cost, or how long it would take to build a project of this scale solo..
That said, welcome to my project. I started here, and I find myself coming back to share my most valued creation. Anyways, currently I have no funding but I have 100s of prop models, and between 10-15 animated mobs - just enough for the basics  ;)

I hope to get a lot of followers here on moparscape, and looking forward to seeing some of you even play in the future! Thanks for reading :)</description>

however, the server CAN force a direction on the fly, for something such as a combat event ;)

              <p>Since that last screen shot I’ve gutted the excess code, added more comments, documented animation / entity id lists, implemented a simple user banning system… and uh… a lot of other little things that were a must before ever selling or publishing this thing.<br>
I actually started a character design feature and male / female selection, but with this update I had to remove the old player movement code - as soon as movement is re implemented I am going to either sell this (if anybody buys by then) or take time off of work each month and look for an investor or make a Kick Starter campaign and show off the polished build…<br>
I can’t just let the source be forgotten and unused, not after all of the effort and stress I’ve invested. I’m not saying it will be a content packed game, but it will be a fully functional digital world with seriously developed entity interaction, and could be taken to the next level with some creativity (which I’ve always lacked)</p>
<p>The code is so lightweight and clean currently that I believe any experienced RSPS developer who thoroughly understands an “morpg protocol” would be able to take this to the next level with enough patience and funds. I’ve spent a lot of time strategically designing the code to be a potential product in the RSPS scene - or at least something that could be advertised here.</p>

              <p>I’ve created a digital world with server controlled object coordinates, animations, and a working user interface. It was a huge waste of time, energy, and cash, but I’ve created something I originally thought was impossible.<br>
Things were getting tedius, like fine tuning the terrain textures, spawn positions, which props should be where, etc… I think my only passion was learning and creating the game itself, and honestly, I don’t think I ever had intentions to implement full blown content.</p>
<p>It’s time to lay this project to rest for myself, but I am willing to sell open source copies of the entire project with life time support via email. Send me a private message if interested.</p>
<p>Here’s one final screen shot, with full server / client communication, movement, and npc / prop spawning. It’s basically a bare bones MORPG written in Java… in the infant stages of a potential beta for somebody with enough knowledge and drive. Methods exist for everything from npc spawns, to player teleporting, to prop spawning and removal… This is legit, and to top it off, most of the source code is commented and documented so that new developers can pick up fast.<br>

Alright listen. Right now, I’m learning how a 3D game engine is made because writing content is very easy for me. It’s always been the skeleton of the game that has confused me and I’m tackling that issue right now.</p>

<p>Lol’d srsly</p>
<p>Once you don’t have to waste years reinventing what’s been done a million times you can actually focus on the game itself. No one outside of the programming community cares that you made 3d objects show up on a screen in the long run, and you don’t get money based on that.</p>
<p>It’s good for practice, but expecting to actually compete you better have a solid idea and years worth of free time. Blackwake is a small scale game and I’m using a prebuilt engine and it’s still taken me a year, if I had to actually write the engine I wouldn’t have even started on content yet.</p>

<p>I like the way you do things honestly. Also, I really want to keep computer programming and game creation something that isn’t able to be done easily. If people make things that make games very easy to make, none of us will make money in the future (that is if we all head into game development as a career). What you need to do is build from scratch a game, and write your code so well that things become easy to add because game engines are really demolishing the talent of a real game developer.</p>

<p>I used to play this when it was 2d and had very little amounts of content. Atm it looks good but the terrain has too much dof/blending/blurr w.e you want to call it. It’s really hard to see the textures. Also the fog could use some work, also the models specular doesn’t fit with the terrain, probably use a flat diffusion on them to match terrain detail for now. If you could get anti-aliasing, that would make my eyes burn a little less. Though I have no expertise on doing what I have mentioned, I do know what I am talking about as I see this detail all over runescape…</p>

<p>Awesome to hear you played the old 2D version! And yes, currently I am focusing on making the terrain look better. I haven’t had feedback since I started really, so it’s great to get some from this community - and it’s been pointed out that it looks like shit (as well as the UI) lol.</p>
<p>Based on local machine settings the client will choose between standard gl rendering OR gl anti aliasing x4 - but based on my craptop, the client is always configured to use the lowest possible graphic settings :o<br>
People who can afford nice hardware will have a much more aesthetic game in front of them, with features including but not limited to: a moving sky dome, sun model, sun light source, and overall better looks with the 3D world <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I’ll have to let somebody with a solid machine logic and take a few pics, or maybe a video… a video would be great tbh. Any volunteers?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Update:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Deleted old terrain / region system and created a standalone loader that loads heightmap images from the cache</li>
<li>Server now manages a “3D background world” for game logic such as real-time gravity and collision validation… ( strong gravity is no longer stressful on the client <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> )</li>
<li>New server protocol layout (still basic, following KISS principle for now, don’t harass me about it)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&gt; new protocol structure:
--&gt; server (realm) logic updated every 600ms (gravity, stat regeneration, etc - all working in multi player)
--&gt; server (protocol) dispatch every 250ms (4x per second)
--&gt; client reads incoming packets non-stop (running on separate thread with a 10ms sleep)
note: client rendering and updating is still executed on a set value of 30x or 60x per second based on Settings..</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Multi-player chatbox with world chat packets / console command parsing</li>
<li>All local client content deleted, so now what you see is what the server feeds you… This build is much healthier, but now there are only the basics: prop rendering, player rendering, movement, and the User Interface…</li>
<li>Server controlled teleporting or forced movement updates</li>
<li>Death event handled server side (tested via command “/die” at the moment - restores all stats and respawns player at center of world map)</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">TODO</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Polish up current features and slowly re-build the content foundation (almost done with this one already tbh)</li>
<li>Convert client-side “primitive mob following” methods to work server-sided instead…</li>
<li>Unarmed combat (kick attack) based on stamina (available in case you have 0 mana or arrows)</li>
<li>Projectile system with server-side collision validation (for arrows and spells used in PvP)</li>
<li>Left click PvP combat system… (polled attacks, with hot keys for potion consumption)</li>
<li>Npc rendering and updating</li>
<li>Mob vs Mob combat update (PvP + PvN + NvN support)</li>
<li>Familiar that follows you around… (probably going to require funds for new model creation unless I can get creative… it costs me $65 USD for a new custom made fully animated model)</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve got a lot more to do but I had some free time today and managed to knock out a huge set of much needed tasks.</p>
