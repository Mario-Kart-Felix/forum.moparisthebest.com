    <title>[PI]Making my own spellbook</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-making-my-own-spellbook/422456</link>
    <description>So what I&#39;m trying to do is create my own spellbook with customs sprites and stuff. The only problem is that I am completely unaware of where i would make the sprite a button. So far I have created the actual interface and i stole the ancient home tele and shoved it into it. All i need to do is make a clickable sprite in the interface. Then i could probably do the rest. So yea...any suggestions, tips would be great. 

The only reason i was able to do this is because the home tele already has an id

<p>Well pretty much what you would do is add the sprites\interfaces\Lunar and Magic</p>
<p>Then you would have to make a actionButtonID for this (i have no idea where as i have never done it) Then a case number in ClickingButtons.java so when they click it, it actually teles them. Anyways good luck to u.</p>
