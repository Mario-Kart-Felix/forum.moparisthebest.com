    <title>See through platebody, glitched shield, boots, and gloves.. HELP!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/see-through-platebody-glitched-shield-boots-and-gloves-help/431616</link>
    <description>Okay, so I&#39;m not stupid, I&#39;m just new to RSPS Development. I am using a PI source and client. And I just finished adding vesta&#39;s, statius, primal, and promethium.. Everything works great for the most part.. promethium and primal sheilds dont move when you run. the boots seem to just stretch instead of moving with your feet, and equipping gloves makes the characters arms disappear.. also the vesta&#39;s, statius, prom, and primal platebody&#39;s have graphics issues. they look decent if you&#39;re standing still but u can still see the characters sleeves.. and it gets way worse when you run.. it looks like the sleeves of the armor dont move but the arms of the character move? how would i go about fixing that? is it a source or client issue? is it animation issue? please help me! I have msn and teamviewer!</description>

<pre><code>    if(i == 13993)

<p>you didnt add it to the right spot in the items file. you gotta add plate bodys in the plate body section, gloves in the glove section…ect. if nothing is defined for that item, the spot is the right hand wep.</p>
