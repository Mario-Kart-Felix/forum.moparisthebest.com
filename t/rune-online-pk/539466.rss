This is a PK server where item and level caps are increased to allow very high hits, usually resulting in a one-hit kill. The map is limited to a small section of Varrock and most of it is a multi-combat PK zone with no level restrictions, this keeps everyone near the action at all times.

Level caps are increased to 135 and all combat stats can be maxed in a few minutes by clicking dummies, excluding prayer. Prayer is trained via lamps found randomly and is trained mostly to increase your combat level.

The combat system is pretty standard, except you can spam click (mass) the attack option to increase your attack speed. This is where combat levels become useful because you have to right click higher levels, making it harder to mass. Weapon speeds and attack styles (accurate, defensive, etc.) also make a difference even when massing. Some of the best gears are black, white and initiate, with bonuses in the hundreds, and two-handed weapons can wear shields for even more bonuses.

All items are lost on death unless you use protect item and loots only last 30 seconds before they vanish completely (15 to appear to everyone). The goal is to make deaths an event for everyone, giving little time for the killer to loot everything and having people swarm over the loot and hopefully causing even more deaths. Since there&#39;s such little time to loot everything this also removes items from the game so they still hold value over time.
