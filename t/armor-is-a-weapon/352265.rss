              <p>If you are using Delta, go into the item class(item.java) and look for public int platebody or body(if you want it to be weared as platebody). Or you can just look for a platebody or body id, and look for it into the item class, and there add the ID of the item you want to be weared as body or plateâ€¦</p>
