    <title>Need some major 317 help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-some-major-317-help/417986</link>
    <description>Right, thing is, i&#39;m shit at scripting.

The only thing i can do is see patterns, and learn off things already used in the source. For example, i can create cmds, just by looking at how the one above works. (I know that&#39;s easy).

But, i just need some help with the following problems;

Customs
Minigames
Shops (Moving them around, changing items, names, prices, NPC speaking, and moving/or not)
Moving mobs, their drops, drop rates, and movement.
EXP Rates for all skills.
My default chat style/colour on my client seems to be some effect. I basically want that back to normal.
How to disable/enable admins from trading/dropping etc.
Tabs
Quests
How to make items drop/spawn on the ground in certain locations
How to make staff-only objects.
How to change the default port and server-ip, so you don&#39;t have to manually change it to XXX everytime...
How to change the default username and password, so you don&#39;t have to enter it. (owner only)
How to change what you get, when you steal from NPC&#39;s or stalls.
How to remove all &#39;nulls&#39; from the game.
How to make safe and unsafe pking zones.
How to make global objects.

If you can help me with any of these, it would be greatly appreciated !</description>
