Are you thick? Because that is the silliest and stupidest post i have seen for a while.<br>
Do you not think i know that. Let me explain for you people with a very small mind.</p>
<p>Some people who own sites will just ring their host up and sort it out on the phone… Or threaten to go to another company. Mopar drove all the way down to his datacenter to try and sort it out…</p>
<p>It shows he has alot of time for this place.</p>
<p>Now dont post anymore stupid comments like that again.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>You obviously don’t associate with many website owners then. Maybe you just know the moparscape type who can’t drive anyway, so only have one option - to call the host.</p>
<p>And anyway, think of all the adsense mopar would lose out on if he didn’t go sort his host out asap :P[/quote]</p>
<p>I dont associate myself with “Moparscapers” Like yourself.</p>
