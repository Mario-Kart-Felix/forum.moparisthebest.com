<p>Lol sorry bro, but this stuff is REALLY basic, its as simple as going into the search bar in the folder, and type in the line of text you want to change, find it, and change it to what you want it to be.  I wouldnt consider hosting this unless 1. Your a fast learner and learn java really quick, or 2. Hire a coder…</p>

</aside>
<p>OR 3. start from the basics just like YOU did at one point. Noone is born with java knowledge just because it is easy for you and me don’t mean its easy for someone who never looked at java before</p>
<p>and about above ^ dont use TV try it for yourself it is EASY just search in Client.java the names you want to change using ctrl+f open client.java in notepad</p>
