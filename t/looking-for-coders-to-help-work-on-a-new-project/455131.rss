    <title>Looking for coders to help work on a new project</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-coders-to-help-work-on-a-new-project/455131</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking for one or two programmers/coders to help me work on a server/client. I plan to have a website, webclient, forum, advertisting. I&#39;m looking for two people who can patch, add customs, donator system, vote system, etc. I can&#39;t pay you right now, but once the server is up (the sooner the better) i can start to pay you.

fill this out if interested:

What type of server are you most comfortable with?(317 etc):
How much experience do you have in coding rsps?:
Willing to split payments for VPS, ect?(It&#39;s perfectly okay if you aren&#39;t):
Age:
What else can you code apart from rsps?:
Hours available per day:
Would you prefer coding the server by yourself or with another coder?:
Got skype, windows live messenger, AIM?
Add anything notable here:

Comment on here and I will PM you to get in closer contact.

I plan to run this project for a while and i&#39;m willing to pay the fees until the server picks up.

Thanks</description>
