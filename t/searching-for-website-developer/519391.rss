<p>Experience with cPanel: cPanel = Control Panel, which is different for each web hosting company, for the most part. I’ve worked with tons of different cPanel’s, they’re all fairly similar and easy for me to navigate.</p>
<p>What is your purpose of pursuing a position in our development team:<br>
I took a break from RSPS and website development for a while, and I’m trying to get back into it. And this seems like a nice server.</p>
<p>How many hours can you perform your responsibilities per day/week:<br>
At least three hours a day.</p>
<p>Have you held any position with another RSPS:<br>
Yes</p>
<p>What are the past RSPS Servers you have worked with if yes:<br>
Several different servers…</p>
<p>[ul][li]HaloScape[/li]<br>
[li]Runeiverse[/li]<br>
[li]Tantalizing-317[/li]<br>
[li]EclipseRuins[/li]<br>
[li]OldSchoolScape[/li]<br>
[li]317 Fury[/li]<br>
[li]Blitz-PK[/li]<br>
[li]More that I’m having troubles remembering.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Would you be willing to attend your interview over Skype via Voice Chat?:<br>
Of course, my Skype username is aj.cordio, feel free to add me if you think I’ll be a good addition to the development team.</p>

I'm not so comfortable about this statement, but I suppose it is allowed if you aren't organizing it through these forums.

<p>A lot of starting out servers pursue that route to make them look more professional, it sometimes works and sometimes doesn’t. There’s quite a few of the bigger servers over the years who have actually registered themselves as companies and use hidden structures like this and the usual administrator ranks on the surface for players to see. Definitely not a first, though :P.</p>
