    <description>Hey guys! 
Whats up?

My router is &quot;Airlink Jensen Skandinavia&quot;, default gateway is 192.168.0.1

Well, my problem is, i cant make that port forwarding, i&#39;ve tried several times, but it never works. Some people who actually got servers have tried to teamview me, but it NEVER works...
can any of u help me with this problem?

If u know this uTorrent portforwarding thats as good, but i&#39;ve tried that too.
I had a server with uTorrent portforwarding, but i changed router, and when i try to do the same now, it dont go 

Pleeeeaaase guys! Help mee
