    <description>Anyone read this book? I decided that I needed a book to read while on holiday so I got my friend from philosophy class to find me something good to do with philosophy (As I never read so I have no idea what book would be good). He gave me sophie&#39;s world. 

Was a pretty epic book, explained the entire history of philosophy, a long with a very strange and gripping story line. 

Anyone else read this? 

I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in philosophy.</description>
