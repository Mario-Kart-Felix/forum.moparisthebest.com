    <title>Design in Progress. Ideas? Comments?</title>

    <description>Ok I am a huge Gears of War/Gears of War 2 fan. And I have decided to make my first model. And they are going to be Gears of War/Gears of War 2 items. So far I have the ideas of making the COG tags (necklace/ammy space) and the Torque Bow (bow space.) Here are some pictures I found on Google that I will be using along the way.

              <p>COG tags will be easy to make, but the bow thing, you should make it a little simpler and on use-mode… not when it is folded up…</p>
<p>i suggest starting out with a cross-bow and making it more like a regularbow, so it has the gun-type look with some bow in it…</p>
