    <description>Im trying to make a webclient and my client.jar wont load it says this - same as webclient

i jsut found something out!t! this is before i jarred it - in my client there is a file called &quot;raw&quot; with it the client works and without it says the same error as the webclient...do i have to add this to the cache folder? i dont know at all what to do

Im trying to make a webclient and it looks like everything is loading perfect then while its loading it says

&quot;Sorry, an error has occurred whilst loading cursedpkz.
To fix this try the following(in order)
1.Close all browser windows and reloading  -  check, still not working
2.Try clearing cache  -  done, still not working
3.Try using different game world  -  I don&#39;t know if this even applies...
4.Try rebooting your computer  -  done, still broken
5.Try selecting a different version of Java from the play game menu&quot;

use this url to see what i mean - http://cursedpkz.webs.com/webclient.htm

umm i have no idea how to fix this can some please help me  !!!!!!!!!
i will pay some1 if they can give me a working solution for this error or who can fix it for me with teamviewer
