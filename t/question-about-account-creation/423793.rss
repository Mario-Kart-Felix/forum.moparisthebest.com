    <title>Question about Account Creation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-about-account-creation/423793</link>
    <description>Before you post any account creation tutorials in an attempt to up your rep, No, I do not need help coding it, it&#39;s actually ready to be implemented should I decide to go with it. I want to hear your opinions about adding it however. Many people go to private servers to get away from a lot of shit from real RS. I&#39;ve already asked on my own community and they mostly wanted it, however these opinions came from account holders. I want to hear from people who are not a part of my community. Imagine yourself about to join a new private server. Would you care that you have to actually create an account, rather than simply logging into one? Or would you think it&#39;s a good thing, that there is some sort of professionalism, along with the immediate account security added by creating your account (we have email recoveries should you be unable to access your account) seeing as I&#39;d have you link your account with an email from the get-go. So what do you guys think, should I do it? Should I leave it as-is? Post your opinions as well, they will be appreciated.</description>

<p>Rep doesn’t really matter here <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>But overall, I voted yes, makes it look professional, and in the long run will probably get players who would stay :o</p>

I am not sure I follow either. You are stating you make the account on a site but the forum account is different? It seems a little redundant to be honest. It would just be faster to do it on the client.</p>

<p>To answer your question, no…I would prefer to be able to make my own named account.  Logging on to a random named account would be awkward.</p>

              <p>I like the idea to be honest of already logging into a played account somewhat. In all truthfulness, unless you own a server with 500 players experience is going to be lowered to gain more players in most cases. Because of this, it would be logical to go ahead and give them SOME stats I suppose.</p>
<p>Another idea I had a long time ago was making it so anybody who logs in would be an “auto mod” you would start off with the crown etc. However, the command powers were determined by how long you have played. Was just a random thought I had a while back but never went for it.</p>
