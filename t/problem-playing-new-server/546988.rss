    <description>Hey, I just downloaded a rsps source and I have decided to create my own rsps based off this, when I go to play the rsps, it is completely fun until I log in then this message is spammed from what I believe every file in the client folder, I may be wrong.

              <p>I am almost certain now that it is a problem connecting to the cache, as these files that it is having trouble opening look like they’re in the cache. It seems to be not connecting I believe but I cannot work out for the life of me why, I searched for every connection to the cache and made sure it was to the right file but it still seems not to work.</p>

If you’re playing the server, and randomly files are trying to be opened like that… Well I can think of only 2 things: somewhere in the code, it’s executing a command to open a file. Or, you have a file selected and as you play you tried opening it (not likely, but yea…).</p>
<p>To find the code executing it, if there is some… That may or may not be easy.<br>
You’re going to have to dig in like all the files and look for it, and you’d also have to know what to look for…</p>
<p>You could try getting a new source and server, see if that one works without your issue. if so, then the other one might of had some code as a form of leech protection or something…</p>

I’m still not understanding your issue, exactly…<br>
It’s creating files? Or what?<br>
The pic you just showed, is fine.<br>
I see literally nothing wrong with the files…<br>
.class files are compiled Java files.<br>
.java files are java source files.</p>

              <p>I have no idea what you’re talking about. How is a message spammed from a file?<br>
If you could give better pictures of your issue (instead of pictures of you trying to open a file with a file format that your computer doesn’t know) it might help more… And maybe better details on the issue…</p>
