              <p>I think it depends what kind of game you like playing. Some gamers prefer to play more realistic games. They enjoy them a lot more because maybe they understand what is happening and it can relate to something they know in real life. For example, in BattleField 2, you could easily relate this to a war between two sides. (And it is quite a realistic war if you take away respawns.)</p>
<p>Then, on the other hand, you have CoD. Don’t get me wrong I like a game of CoD but for completely different reasons. This game is not realistic and you cannot relate it to anything that really happens in real life. Snipers don’t go around quick scoping. People don’t do 360’s in Iraq. That would be stupid (maybe someone has done it, I don’t know.).</p>
<p>So these games, in theory, could be placed on entirely different platforms. As other people have said; Battlefield is a strategic game that often requires teamwork and this resembles what it would be like in a real war. Modern Warfare is much more of a fast paced FPS, where you are a computer character with a gun, not a marine fighting a war.</p>

              <p>Battlefield is a more slow-paced strategy game. How often do you see real teamwork in CoD? Bad Company 2 is built around the kit system, and everyone has a role to help their team in any kit. It’s slow-paced because the maps are so large. Perhaps Battlefield 3 will add a few maps that are smaller for faster action. Don’t get me wrong, Battlefield games are still full of action anyway, you just need to know where to go.</p>
<p>Campers are easy to destroy in Bad Company 2 just as easy as they are in CoD. As said above, you have access to so many weapons and tools to destroy campers. Also,  unless you’re playing hardcore, the game will also show you where the person was/is going while you respawn.</p>
<p>One thing I am hoping for in BF3 is that they will have more unlocks. I can’t remember what the level is (22 or 23), but after that in BC2 you didn’t unlock anything else. I’m also hoping for more game types.</p>
<p>As I said before, you are comparing two completely different games. In my opinion, MW2 is a broken game that is no longer fun to me except for quickscoping matches. Otherwise CoD 4, Battlefield games, or RDR for me.</p>

              <p>While I voted BF, how can you compare different games? The only similar thing is the fact that it’s a first person shooter. Each game was designed entirely different. Call of Duty is based around a quick game, along with an easy to play shooter, while in Battlefield, the games take more time, and it’s not as easy to get a crazy game with like 85 kills, because there is always more to worry about (choppers, snipers, manned turrets, mortar, etc.).<br>
I just don’t think they are comparable, as they are each good and bad in there own reasons. If the poll was you have 2 disks in front of you and you can put one into play, I’d place battlefield in, but I play COD a lot too.</p>

<p>Bigger maps = More campers in my opinion. COD keeps it’s maps to more of a medium size and the only real big map there is in MW2 is Wasteland or whatever and there are no buildings so <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> COD ftw :p[/quote]<br>
There isn’t as many campers as there are in cod. In bfbc2, there are so many things to destroy a camper, its pointless. It is also very hard because of the follow cam after your dead.</p>

<p>Generally, campers are smarter and tend to rack up a better KDR overall.</p>

<p>Bigger maps = More campers in my opinion.
