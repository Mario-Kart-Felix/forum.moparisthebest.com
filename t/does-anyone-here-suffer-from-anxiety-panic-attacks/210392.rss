    <title>Does anyone here suffer from anxiety/panic attacks?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-anyone-here-suffer-from-anxiety-panic-attacks/210392</link>
    <description>Hello I have been suffering from anxiety and panic attacks for close to 5 years now and its getting pretty bad now I was just wondering if anyone else here has the same thing and what you do to help yourself? I know they had medications to get the physical symptoms away but I have heard bad things about these and my parents don&#39;t want me taking it. If anyone here knows anything that will help I would appreciate it very much and if you want to share your story about your anxiety/panic attacks ill be happy to read them. 

Thank-you for your time.</description>
