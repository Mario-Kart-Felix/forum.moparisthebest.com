    <title>Index Cards by Ron</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/index-cards-by-ron/296769</link>
    <description>Here&#39;s a useful script for studying. It&#39;s unfinished and all my ideas were left in the script. Hope you like it.

Script is attached with the study text file I used to generate the flash cards. If you want to make your own, all you do is setup a text file with the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;## this is the 1st flash card
Q=What&#39;s Ron&#39;s sign?
A=Scorpio
## 2nd flash card
Q=How tall is Ron?
A=5&#39;11&quot;
## 3rd flash card
Q=What&#39;s a weenus?
A=The skin on your elbow&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>That was when i was in high school enjoying scripting with a very active scar community. Most of the community has dispersed and left for other macroing programs. I still program every now and then when i get a chance. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
