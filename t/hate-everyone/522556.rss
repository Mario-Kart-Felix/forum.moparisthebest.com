    <title>Hate everyone?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hate-everyone/522556</link>
    <description>Am I the only one who just hates everyone I meet except for a few exceptions that are usually people online? My family are just incredibly bland whom I can hardly relate to and who I would never associate with unless I were born into it. Back at the school year I just fucking hated every second of school, even though I like learning, I just find people annoying all the damn time. At my part time job they&#39;re mostly just cackling cunts who just drive me INSANE and the only way to cope without yelling at them to shut the hell up is to come online and bitch about it like I am now. Others are just sooooooooooo bland and lifeless and may as well be a different species that I am. Anyone else here feel like no one thinks remotely like I do on anything? I&#39;ve given up on the political atmosphere, at least for my country, because both political parties are just so far off from my political vantage point they may as well be the exact same thing. Everyone&#39;s religious here in America and I&#39;m anti-religious, even my mom still bugs me to go to church every sunday. I&#39;ve met people with the same sentiment on this as me, people who claim they hate everyone. But I just don&#39;t buy it, because my ex said she hated most people too but she never showed it, and I felt like she just said it at the time to agree with me.

Does anyone TRULY feel like they could go for a full year without speaking to one single human being as long as they&#39;ve got their computer and good food? That&#39;s how I&#39;m feeling everyday. I know I&#39;m sounding like a depressed little teenager but that&#39;s not the case. I&#39;m very content with who I am, in fact I&#39;m very egotistical, which is part of the reason I hate so many people. Does anyone else actually hate people? Don&#39;t just say it like in a joking sense, I mean are you literally frustrated everyday by how freaking stupid and boring everyone else is? Or am I being ridiculous?</description>

              <p>I’m a very hateful person what can I say? I think we all hate certain things, we even hate family at times…especially when we are younger. As you get older though you will realize that we let our emotions get to us and that at the end of the day we will probably apologize to each other and go to sleep peacefully.</p>

Hey, that’s not fair. I don’t hate everybody. It is just that I don’t get along with people very well, as I’m not a very likeable person.[/quote]<br>

              <p>Sounds like you don’t find anyone socially stimulating; nothing wrong with this I guess unless you’re just looking for something to moan about. If you’re bored of people go out and find some people that have similar interests and intelligence to you, you might think other people are stupid and insignificant and can’t relate to you, and a lot of people probably don’t relate to you, you just need to meet the right sort of people. Man is a social animal, we should befriend those of whom are of similar interests and status, if you don’t want to pretend to like people then don’t, show them some common courtesy (because being an ass is just not nice, everyone is just trying to live their lives) and get on with your life.</p>

              <p>[quote=“jme, post:30, topic:522556”]Definitely a depressed teenager emotionally detached, angsty. puberty like eXemplar said… On top of that not really the social type by school-kid standards. It’s all just a bad mix.</p>
<p>Try not to discredit people too quick, they are real people with their own life experiences. Unless they are harming you than you should be respectful. You are also training yourself to think negatively about everything and should try to stop that.</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>I get on with both sexes pretty equally, although I don’t really have any best friends. I mean, if I’m out with the guys we’re usually going to the football or drinking. If I’m out with people from work we usually go to the strippers. If I’m out with family (excluding my big brother/dad who I sometimes drink with) we’re usually at a family party or something like that. If I’m out with a girl I’m usually trying to wire my way in for a ride. Close friends are overrated. Just hover between groups but make sure you’re heard in the group and that if you weren’t there you’d be missed.</p>
<p>Wanna hear a wise mans decision on how to sort it? Drink.</p>

</aside>
<p>Why are close friends over rated Ruby? Becoming close just happens by circumstance with the right people.[/quote]<br>
Well that’s just how I see it really. I mean, me and my big brother are pretty close but other than that everyone else is just friends. I mean, if a close friend stabs you in the back it hurts but if someone who you just hang around with and are friends with does it really doesn’t hurt the same you just laugh it off and tell him to go fuck himself. I have a tonne of friends but I just couldn’t imagine being “close” to any of them, it’s quite hard to explain. I used to have a good few close friends at the start of highschool which was like 7 years ago now but we just drifted and just hung around from time to time for a drink and stuff, I just prefer it this way.</p>

I can pretty much relate. But not on the ALL Hate.</p>
<p>This community already knows my age. My feeling to everyone my age is that they are not mature at all and just like to go crazy every second. Either that or they think they can get fame without them doing anything. They’ll walk up to me and think so much of themselves. The truth is, I feel as if I am maybe 10x smarter than those idiots. That’s sorts the reason why I’ge been hanging out at mopar for 3 years by now. The people here (well, most) are atleast of the mentallity I like. Plus they enjoy my habit (programming :D).</p>
<p>My suggestion? Hang out in mopar and try to get some friends here. There are people here who range from complete idiot and perfect personallity.</p>
<p>Meh, even we can talk maybe sometime soon. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

Unless your profile lies about your age, it is surprising how composed your rhetoric is. But when I was 12 I didn’t experience the thoughts I do now. I found it got much worse as I grew up.[/quote]<br>
No, its not a lie.</p>

<p>Yes, it would be ridiculous to actually hate every person, I did make somewhat of an overstatement, but it wasn’t far off.</p>
<p>I work with about 7 people, 2 of which I don’t mind, one of those is my brother. The rest are VERY annoying, they’re very pretentious and it bugs me. I also don’t enjoy talking to my boss, but I can’t really do anything about that because she gives me my paycheck every week. I don’t really deal with customers, but I usually don’t mind adults right at first, because they’re just polite and not annoying.</p>

<p>Don’t know what kind of social experiment would warrant me going on a forum and saying that I hate most people. Sounds like a pathetic one.</p>
<p>[quote=“Ruby, post:25, topic:522556”]I get on with both sexes pretty equally, although I don’t really have any best friends. I mean, if I’m out with the guys we’re usually going to the football or drinking. If I’m out with people from work we usually go to the strippers. If I’m out with family (excluding my big brother/dad who I sometimes drink with) we’re usually at a family party or something like that. If I’m out with a girl I’m usually trying to wire my way in for a ride. Close friends are overrated.

Well to be my friend is a minority, and they are close to me. I’m the opposite of you, I have maybe 1 or 2 friends that I really enjoy being around and we’re really close. I don’t like people enough to be a social bee to every clique around.</p>
<p>[quote=“arham 4, post:26, topic:522556”]I can pretty much relate. But not on the ALL Hate.</p>
<p>This community already knows my age. My feeling to everyone my age is that they are not mature at all and just like to go crazy every second. Either that or they think they can get fame without them doing anything. They’ll walk up to me and think so much of themselves. The truth is, I feel as if I am maybe 10x smarter than those idiots. That’s sorts the reason why I’ge been hanging out at mopar for 3 years by now. The people here (well, most) are atleast of the mentallity I like. Plus they enjoy my habit (programming :D).</p>
<p>My suggestion? Hang out in mopar and try to get some friends here. There are people here who range from complete idiot and perfect personallity.</p>
<p>Meh, even we can talk maybe sometime soon. :)[/quote]<br>
Unless your profile lies about your age, it is surprising how composed your rhetoric is. But when I was 12 I didn’t experience the thoughts I do now. I found it got much worse as I grew up.</p>

One problem here, I never said I hate myself or my life. In fact if you would’ve read my posts I actually called myself egotistical.</p>

<p>This argument is ridiculous that I hear all the time. “Those are other human beings!” Right, because people are different than human beings. “Human beings” are just more nice, moral, intelligent beings, and PEOPLE are well, people. I don’t admire them anymore just because they have life experiences; that doesn’t deserve merit. Everyone will have experiences no matter what. I don’t think of it as “training” myself, I think of it more as a reaction.</p>

<p>I know you get along with everyone, I have always enjoyed your company, but how in the world can someone blatantly just hate everyone and assume he hates people before he even meets them? That’s not normal lol.</p>

<p>Why are close friends over rated Ruby? Becoming close just happens by circumstance with the right people.</p>

<p>I used to be like you and think everyone at my school was a loveing idiot and their lives were insignificant and worthless. Then I realized people aren’t as stupid as you think and everyone is just trying to make the best of their lives. If you ever sit and talk one-on-one with most people in your school, I’m sure you’ll see how cool they can be - especially the popular kids I’m sure you hate the most. Eventually you’ll grow to not care about what anyone else thinks if you’re true to what you’re saying - only caring about intelligence and learning - which I can plainly see is currently bullshit since you focus so much on hating everyone else. At the point in my life I’m at, I don’t have any enemies and every single person I know is kind to me. Even if they weren’t and hated me, I could care less. Don’t spend so much time hating everyone else because you think they’re dumb and annoying, because life will kick them in the ass and you won’t even be there to see it.</p>

<p>Well I don’t sit in my house watching TV hating people, it only really consumes my time when I’m forced to interact with them. Unfortunately, there’s just no possible way to live in this world without talking to a lot of people on a day-to-day basis. Of course you can bullshit for awhile, after some time you get tired of faking nice for those who don’t deserve it.</p>

              <p>I lived a very different life to everyone I went to high school with basically, so I never related to any of them. I was also barely ever at school given I travelled so damn much and would probably average 2 days a week I attended. Given that I travelled so much all my friends growing up were a fair bit older than me (I was like 14/15 and my best friend was like 19) so I was a lot more mature than 90% males in my year</p>
