    <description>I just lay there, motionless, breathing as quietly as I could out of my nose. I couldn’t be seen or heard. If I got caught, I would surely not live to see her again. After all, this was all for her. If I hadn’t of been in the wrong place at the wrong time, none of this would of happened. It was all my fault. All my fault her life was in danger, and there was little I could do. She was calling my name. I knew she was. She was thousands of miles away, but I could hear her. I missed her. The way she smiled, the way she laughed at my jokes, which, most of the time, weren’t funny. 

I slowly lifted my hands up from the leafy forest floor and made a slow move for my pocket. I’m sure I had my pocket knife with me. I must of. I needed it. I needed it to stay alive. To keep her alive. It was there. I felt the plastic, smoothed handle, and stroked it. As I slowly pulled it out of my pocket, I heard something. A scream. I jolted and ripped my jeans as I opened the knife half way out of my pocket. I jumped up and held the knife out in front of me, ready for an attack. It was round here, and it was after me. 

I looked around, sweat dripping in to my eye. My heart was beating uncontrollably. I could see my chest thumping with the beat. I looked around one more time and ran. I ran faster than I had ever ran before. It was after me and it could hear me. The brown Autumn leaves were crunching under my feet. I had to run, and I had to get out of here. The knife was slipping out of my grip, and I was unable to hold on to it any longer. It fell on to the hard, crispy leaves below me. My only way of survival had gone. She was going to die. 

‘God, help me.’ I thought as I carried on running through the forest. I was still being chased. It knew me, it knew her. It was the thing that was going to kill her. She was thousands of miles away, and I would never get to see her again. I never got to say goodbye to her. The last time we spoke, felt like an age away. She never used to say she loved me. I never used to say it to her either, but we both knew we felt it. We both knew that me and her did love each other. I felt a tear, go past all the sweat, and fall of the end of my nose. I needed her. I carried on running, trying to keep myself alive for along as I could, knowing I was going to die. There was no point denying it. My body was shaking and my head was spinning. 

Slight slithers of light were beaming down through the tops on the trees. It was such a tranquil area, with such an evil presence. The smell was beautiful. The smell of wood and fresh air was so clean. Birds whistled and animals wandered. It was such a  beautiful day, I found it hard to believe that this was the last day of my life. Everything was moving so slowly, and I was taken away by the beauty of the area I was in. I was still running, but I couldn’t believe it. It felt like a dream. All my worries and feelings left me and I just stopped, dead silent, not breathing, staring. It was amazing. My gaze moved from the forest in front of me, to the canopy of the forest above. The light was in my eyes, but I could still see and paid no attention to the blinding light. I heard my own breathing and slowly came back in to reality. My heart was still pounding and I could hear everything but the birds and all the natural sounds of the yonder around me.

I ran again. I heard her voice and turned round. She was there, screaming at me. The fear in her eyes was sickening. As I blinked, she disappeared, but I could still hear the screaming around the forest. She was in trouble and there was nothing I could do. My body suddenly felt like lead, and I was pulled down to the floor. I pushed and pushed, but was unable to get myself back up. I lay there, motionless, and closed my eyes. The screaming was ringing in my ears, but I wasn’t in reality. 





More to come......perhaps.</description>

              <p>Nice work Mr.Chris. Here is my critique if you care. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<blockquote>the way she laughed at my jokes, which, most of the time, weren’t funny.</blockquote>
lol funny.
<blockquote>We both knew that me and her did love each other.</blockquote>
Should be... "We both knew that her and I did love each other." because you wouldn't say "We both knew that me did love each other. That wouldn't make sense. Sometimes you can use "me and blah" but most of the time it's "I and blah".
<blockquote>I ran again. I heard her voice and turned round. She was there, screaming at me. The fear in her eyes was sickening. As I blinked, she disappeared, but I could still hear the screaming around the forest. She was in trouble and there was nothing I could do.</blockquote>
When you say... "She was there, screaming at me" do you mean that she was angry at the guy or she was screaming in pain because of whatever was chasing the guy?  If it's th elatter, then how can she be screaming at the guy being chased lol. She would just be screaming period, right? 
<p>Other than that, great job Mr.Chris! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
