    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/suggestion-taking-away-20-second-wait-per-post-pm/424181</link>
    <description>Well, tbh, its getting REALLY annoying, don&#39;t know why it was added, maybe to stop bots/people advertising with posts or PMs, but it gets annoying and sometimes it glitches up a bit too, but thats not the point, after a certain point, could the 20 second per ip post/pm be removed for lets say everyone who is 1k+ (Moparian) or lets say Senior Member?</description>

<p>If you can type two messages in less than 20 seconds, they aren’t worth posting. I’d say make it HIGHER for Moparians, since they are the ones that are probably spamming more. Though it’s probably fine the way it is.</p>

<p>Actually, around 3-5pm, the forum is much more active than now, and at this very moment, I think I have 4 pages of newly replied to topics… it gets really irritating and hard to talk to so many people/discuss at once, why should it be higher? Moparians should have less if any, maybe 10 seconds or 5 to wait, since they have been longer and most would probs be more trusted than a FTP…</p>
