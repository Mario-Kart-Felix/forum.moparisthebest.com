    <title>*NEW GAME* Rewriting the RSC client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-game-rewriting-the-rsc-client/230125</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been talking to alot of people in this RSC community and most of them are saying that the only way to acctually get a legit RSC server is to rewrite the RSC client, get new sprites, new map etc. 

I started a research and found a company that is willing to rewrite the client for only $5000.
So I said to myself, alright since I got the money why not invest it in something that I think could work.

But I&#39;m still not 100% sure that this gives me the right to go offical with a game like this. If you sit on any information that could help me please post here.

If I got the right to do this, I would need a develop team.
More info coming soon..</description>

<p>His words are correct :D. And you cant copyright a protocol for the dickwad who is arguing, if you are rewriting the client, i am guessing he is doing something similar to what darkquest is doing?(|But of course more extreme) You would also have to edit alot of things that actually make the game work also, and it will probably take months, maybe years to make a bugless, safe server like rsc used to be like. Look at the dq crew, when did they start this new client they have been making and look how far they are, face it gower didnt make the rsc client in 1 year lmao.</p>

<p>yea, but they keep records of i.p.s and would actually go the distance just to prove your lying under oath and track your i.p. down to your location when signed up, thus putting you behind bars even if the court ruling was innocent.</p>

              <p>I am not so sure about the so called “protocol”; whether it can be copyrighted, or not. I think I have even heard somewhere that this “protocol” is something used by alot of different programs just for the sake of efficiency (the algorithm used). I might be wrong, however. Anyhow, I believe the biggest problem would be that these server-sources have in one or another way been involved with reverse-engineering of the client, that is, in fact Jagex’s.</p>
<p>There are one way, though, with which you can get around copyright infringement. But this involves two different teams. The first team must examine the system, and create a specification covering all to be added. When this is done, the specification must be granted by a lawyer, who checks whether it is legitimate, or not (does not use copyrighted material). If granted, the other team (who must not have any connection with the first team) will implement the system according to the specification provided. This method is called “The Clean Room Design”.</p>
<p>Just a side-note:<br>
I don’t really think a totally new game trying to “mirror” RSC would be a great idea, unless it would actually <em>mirror</em> it. By this, I mean, re-making <em>everything</em> would make this a totally new game. When it comes to new games, I think, for it to be successful (as RSC was), you have to come up with something new and original. Today, the most games uses alot better graphics, and this is almost essential. RSC uses such “bad”, but yet nice graphics (nice and/or fun graphics according to my own opinion) because this was a problem back then (when it was created). Not alot of people had high internet-connection speed back then, and this would drastically decrease the servers capabilities of holding “high” amounts of players (if the graphics was better). Also, the server was most likely written in Java, which was not <em>that</em> good and/or fast back then…</p>
<p>I also guess the graphics was that “bad” compared to others, because Andrew was “somewhat” new to 3D-programming… I might be wrong. But that is what I think. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>So you think that editing every single last object. sprite and landscape in rs u edit that and u want get sued its quite funny mate because rs can sue you for still using all there shit if u researched a bit on the 317 servers and ppl got done for it because of the protocols i.e <a href="http://www.frugooscape.net" rel="nofollow noopener">www.frugooscape.net</a>[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m not going to argue with you, your posts aren’t even coherent.</p>
<p>OP - If you re-write the client and it doesn’t bare resemblence to the current one - different interface, vhange all the images and sounds and possibly some NPC names and how everything in the world is layed out then you should be fine.</p>

              <p>I’ve been talking to alot of people in this RSC community and most of them are saying that the only way to acctually get a legit RSC server is to rewrite the RSC client, get new sprites, new map etc.</p>
<p>I started a research and found a company that is willing to rewrite the client for only $5000.<br>
So I said to myself, alright since I got the money why not invest it in something that I think could work.</p>
<p>But I’m still not 100% sure that this gives me the right to go offical with a game like this. If you sit on any information that could help me please post here.</p>
<p>If I got the right to do this, I would need a develop team.<br>
More info coming soon…</p>
