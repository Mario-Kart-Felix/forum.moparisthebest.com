    <title>Suggestion For Forums. NEED ALL STAFF TO SEE IT P.L.E.A.S.E!</title>

    <description>Im sorry im not doing this in the right section BUT THERE IS NO SECTION!

There should be an &quot;SUGGESTION&quot; forum that people can post an for the following reasons:

1. To let players know what tuts they want.
2. To let the MoparScape Staff know any things that would improve the server.

NOW i know this will probly not happen but this thread will be really helpful! LOTs of people would be going to it to let people know what they want and what would be good for the server.

I just want to give MoparScape Staff an idea and why it will help.

Thanks,
