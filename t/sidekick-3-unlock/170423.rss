<p>That really doesn’t deserve an answer. You don’t unlock a Cell Phone to get into the secure directories, you use it to use a Verizon phone with the at&amp;t network and vise versa . And as far as I know you can use mp3’s for ringtones. You just have to have a program to convert it or transfer it to the phone.</p>

Errm, not quite. Verizon and CDMA and Cingular (AT&amp;T) is GSM. You’d unlock a Verizon phone so it could use Nextel or Sprint, and you’d unlock a T-Mobile/Alltel/Rogers/AT&amp;T phone to use another carrier on the same channel-space.</p>
<p>Unlocking the phone just means that you are removing the SIM card block that T-Mobile placed on your phone, so that you’ll be able to use other GSM carriers (The Sidekick is a phone that operates on the GSM protocol on GSM frequencies)<br>
I don’t recommend that you do it, though, as your phone will lose the ability yo do a lot of things, such as email, etc. Those are stored on Danger’s servers (Danger Inc. made the Sidekick), and, if I recall correctly, you’d need a SIM card from T-Mobile for your phone to access the servers. Just get an unlocked Motorola phone, or buy one and unlock it yourself (it’s really easy)</p>
<p>Hopefully that helps. :D[/quote]</p>
<p>Meh, I was just using Verizon and at&amp;t as an example.</p>

<p>Or you can just jailbreak your iPhone then install SendSong, choose a song, and press “Use as ringtone”. Bam, you have it as your ringtone…</p>
