    <title>Help with setting up CashU</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-setting-up-cashu/536273</link>
    <description>[url=https://www.cashu.com/site/en/consumers]CashU[/url] was mentioned by a friend on mine so I though I would use it for the sake of having another payment method available. 

I was wondering if anybody know how actually use this because I don&#39;t. I want whatever is in the users shopping cart to update with this. 

[size=8pt][php]&lt;form action=&quot;https://sandbox.cashu.com/cgi-bin/pcashu.cgi&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
        &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;merchant_id&quot; value=&quot;my-swagger&quot;&gt; //required
        &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;token&quot; value=&quot;c0859b781cffb4b5472ab44c0b86eeb1&quot;&gt; //required
	&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;display_text&quot; value=&quot;Xite&quot;&gt;
	&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;currency&quot; value=&quot;GBP&quot;&gt;
	&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;amount&quot; value=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt; //required
	&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;language&quot; value=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
	&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;session_id&quot; value=&quot;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;txt1&quot; value=&quot;No text needed here&quot;&gt;
	&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;servicesName&quot; value=&quot;Xite&quot;&gt; //required
&lt;/form&gt;[/php][/size]

That&#39;s what the code looks like for a normal buy now button. The token is generated from CashU&#39;s website (the code is generated on their website, a bit like PayPal). The service name was already created on their website.

When I change the price I get error. (value)
The token is what is verifying? the checkout option? 

Any ideas?</description>
