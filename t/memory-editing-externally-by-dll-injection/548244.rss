    <title>Memory editing externally / by dll injection?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/memory-editing-externally-by-dll-injection/548244</link>
    <description>A few years ago I used to play a FPS called Warrock.

After playing it for a few months, I entered the hacking scene.
Since I had zero programming experience, I just download hacks or copy&amp;pasted existing sources.
The &#39;hacking&#39; was actually just editing the values at certain memory addresses, which was usually done using some API&#39;s in Visual Basic or C# (e.g. WriteProcessMemory).

Then this update happened to the game which made us unable to edit the memory anymore in VB or C#.
That&#39;s when the majority of the community switched to c++ to create dll&#39;s which they would inject into the game.

Now, thinking back about it, I&#39;m wondering why this couldn&#39;t be done in VB or C# anymore.
I recently read that modern OS&#39; prevent us from changing the memory of an external process. Could this have anything to do with it?
This would explain why hacking by injecting a memory-changing-dll into the game works since the game itself would execute it.

Please understand that I&#39;m not asking this with a malicious purpose. I&#39;m just curious and would like to know more about this!</description>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/u/mopman">@Mopman</a>: Most anti-cheats I’ve worked with actually do hook WriteProcessMemory/ReadProcessMemory, but most of them do it with a signed driver hooking the respective Zw functions, usually using a rudimentary method of editing the SSDT. A lot of anti-cheats also ensure that read-execute is set on all of the code pages and when you change the page flags to write they close the game down. Most games that people do DLL injection on, they actually do the injection before the anti-cheat module starts, that way all hooks and preventative measures are avoided. There are anti-cheats nowadays that scan the actual process memory and look for suspicious modules or loaded modules that aren’t in the module list but have a full module header in memory. (ex Nexon’s BlackCipher)</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, Warrock uses HackShield, which has a signed driver and does protect the Warrock process from (most) forms of cross-process memory editing (ex. ZwReadProcessMemory, ZwWriteProcessMemory, ZwOpenProcess) and prevent all calls that don’t originate from the game-process, hence why manipulation from inside the game process via an injected DLL works.</p>

              <p>I don’t know anything about Warrock, but based on ‘some update happened to the game that made us not be able to edit memory anymore’ it could be for a number of reasons, the most likely being:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They updated some form of cheat detection/prevention to stop these simpler cheats. They might be, for example, injecting into processes with open handles to their game and hooking Read/WriteProcessMemory (very unlikely), or they might just look at the memory addresses you were writing to/the write permissions on that area of memory, to see if they change when they shouldn’t have (very likely).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it’s not detection related, perhaps they simply changed whatever you are trying to do in their game, such that simply writing to a memory address isn’t good enough to achieve it anymore, and the easiest way is to call some engine code that does it for you. (Which requires being in process).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It has nothing to do with the OS protecting memory cross process, though. If that were the case, injecting code wouldn’t work either, as this also requires access to the processes memory.</p>
<p>What are you trying to do?</p>

              <p>Well injecting a DLL into a process has some benefits such as being able to execute code directly within the process and having full access to its address space. It’s basically being able to execute your own code within another process.</p>
<p>Also, WriteProcessMemory() is a Windows API function which means it doesn’t matter which language you use (C#, VB, C++, etc.). This means the switch to another language was probably for another reason.</p>
