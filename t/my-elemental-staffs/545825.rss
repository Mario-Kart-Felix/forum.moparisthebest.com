<p>The rings give it that feel of a magic item because they’re floating or being held up by magic, so there isn’t an issue there. An animation added so the rings move would be great for the item too, but that would probably be a lot more difficult.</p>
<p>The thickness and length of the staff also concerns me a bit, when putting it next to the char model try make the staff their length or a bit shorter then them. After doing that size the ball down to match the staff, kinda looks like a giant lollipop at the moment.</p>
<p>Last but not least, colouring. You really should add some shades to the colours even if it is just a few, it’ll really change how you see something.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks amy, ill have a mess about and see what happens haha</p>

<p>I don’t know if I would consider them an upgrade from the default staves. You made them look like they are made out of plastic instead of wood, because the shaft is just a cylinder. If you fix that and make the orb look a bit better (what is the purple stuff supposed to be?) then it might be nice.</p>
