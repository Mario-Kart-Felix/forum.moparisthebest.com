    <title>GuildWars Autofighter</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/guildwars-autofighter/100149</link>
    <description>I do not play RS much nor visit these sites much, but I do still use SCAR. I made an autofighter using SCAR for GuildWars and am posting it here for others to use. there is also a video of it that I made of it in use (at the bottom). I mainly use this to watch T.V. and play GuildWars at the same time. It has complete random wait times, random skill castings, random double skill casting, random movements (left, right, spin around, look back), random targeting of foes, basically everything is random. There may be some stuff that I missed in this paragraph but you can look through the script if you like, enjoy :) .
