    <title>Suspiria (1977)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/suspiria-1977/538442</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t think any of you know this, but I am a huge movie nerd!

and I just wanna talk about one of my favorite movies of all time: Suspiria.


The movie is basically about a young girl who enrolls in a ballet school and witnesses several murders, and she finds out that the school is a front for something far more sinister.

[b]If you are looking for an action packed modern hollywood thriller/horror this is probably not for you.[/b]

[b]If you can&#39;t appreciate scenery and you hate plots that take time to develop, this is probably not for you.[/b]


The movie was directed and written by one of my favorite directors: Dario Argento. I love all of his 70s/80s work. If you&#39;re a fan of Suspiria, you will love his other movies (especially Phenomena and Deep Red!).

I love this movie so much that I&#39;ve taken the liberty of finding it for you guys :) I&#39;d love to hear what you think, and if you like it as much as I do.

The plot doesn&#39;t really start to kick in until about the last 45 minutes, but the first half of the movie is [b]crucial[/b] if you want to understand what&#39;s going on.

AND THE SOUNDTRACK IS FUC[b][/b]KING KICK ASS THE MUSIC GOES PERFECT WITH EVERYTHING IT MAKES MY DI[b][/b]CK SO HARD

I&#39;m going to be honest, I didn&#39;t appreciate as much as I do now until I watched it for the second time for some reason. It&#39;s just one of those movies.

Enough from me:

Like it? Hate it? Meh? Why? :)</description>
