    <description>We&#39;ll I&#39;ve been looking through the source code for about 2 days now. (I am new to the whole RS-PS/Java Script.) And I don&#39;t quiet understand where the &quot;icons&quot; or however you all call them, work. (No offense) I&#39;ve been trying to figure out how to add them in. I&#39;ve been looking at codes for item(s). I&#39;m getting the whole how to set there stats, name them and set a Item ID. Just don&#39;t know how the animation part of it works quiet yet, that&#39;s why I decided to post for help.

I&#39;m sorry if my post doesn&#39;t belong under this topic. I&#39;m trying to learn and be successful in Moparscape.opg, being apart of this huge community. Plus being a successful programmer/Owner.

<p>I’ve been wanting to add in new, “models”, for awhile now and I never thought about posting on here for awhile. (Lol)</p>
<p>By the way, I’ve never been really good with pixels. Even back at Dream Maker. (Where I first started programming/doing everything.) I’ve always had a good imagination but never could get them out. (Lol)</p>
<p>P.S. Thanks for all the help. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>There are several types of models.</p>
<p>Ground models are the items you see placed on the ground.<br>
Equipped models are the items you see when you’re in your equipment screen.<br>
Inventory models are the items you see when you access your inventory.</p>
<p>All in all, they’re categorized into one general term: “models.”</p>
<hr>
<p>You can obtain these animations from Animation list dumps. The models can be obtained from the models section of the community forums.</p>
<p>P.S. If you have a lot of talent you can create your own models. Look into metasequoia.</p>

              <p>So, for the weapon models that would be, for example, the item that pop’s up in the inventory? And for the weapon animation, that would be the actual weapon that your character would be, “wearing”?</p>
<p>How exactly would I be able to obtain these animations and models too?</p>

<p>I couldn’t really understand what you were asking. Don’t worry about trying to word your posts into these emaculate, touched-by-Midas, gifts from God. We’re are learning, it doesn’t have to be perfect :).</p>
<p>Anyways, if you’re talking about the item models. Those would be added client-sided. Weapon animations can be defined server-sided, that depends on your source though.</p>
