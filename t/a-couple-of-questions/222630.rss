    <title>A couple of questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-couple-of-questions/222630</link>
    <description>I am kind of new to coding and am making a server. I know how to do pretty much everything else except add commands. I downloaded a DefaultServer so everything is blank pretty much. If someone could tell me where to put the code for the commands that would be great. I can make commands but I don&#39;t know where to put them.

I was also wondering how I can fix the hair through helmet bug. I found a topic telling how to do that but it seemed poorly written and wasn&#39;t the least bit of help. So if someone could direct me to a topic on how to do this or tell me that would be great.

Thanks.</description>
