    <title>A couple of questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-couple-of-questions/163395</link>
    <description>Hey...I am wondering:
-Does anyone have a link to a good &#39;mod island&#39; tutorial...There was some when I had my old server and I am loooking for it...(I have searched these forums, google and some other forums...but no luck)
-Does anyone know if there is hosting that can host this game?...Like if I were to rent a dedicated server could I run my game server on it?

Thanks - Colin Smiley</description>
