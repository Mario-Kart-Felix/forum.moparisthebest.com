    <title>Help with password unencryption</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-password-unencryption/229479</link>
    <description>Hey guys! First of all, I have a server that has been, overall, pretty successful. In not much time, I reached 4,800 accounts. I&#39;m switching to a source that has encrypted passwords, and I would like to know the easiest way to do this (it wouldn&#39;t be very fun to log in individually to every account on the new server and transfer stats and items).

One more thing: I didn&#39;t want to double post with this or go off topic in my thread, but if anybody knows a free website that I can make to put my .jar webclient on it, it would be great.

Thanks for the help and your time,
PROUD owner of Legendz PK,
