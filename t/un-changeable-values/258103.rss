    <title>Un-changeable values?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/un-changeable-values/258103</link>
    <description>Well for some reason there are some values that no matter what i change them too, they effect in the game is the exact same.

For example, I&#39;ve gone into player.java to change the login position for new members. I changed the values to the coordinates i wanted, compiled, ran the server and STILL when i log in as a new member its the old coordinates not the new. I&#39;ve searched but can&#39;t find what i did wrong or what else i needed to change but nothing came up.

Also, It wont let me change one of the emote teleports

I&#39;ve gone to the right case, and edited the coordinates but it still teleports me to the old coordinates, no matter what i change.

Any help here would be awesome</description>
