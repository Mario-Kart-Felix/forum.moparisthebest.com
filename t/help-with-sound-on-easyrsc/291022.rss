    <title>Help with sound on EasyRSC</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-sound-on-easyrsc/291022</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve resolved most of my issues with easyrsc (or given up on some) but I still can&#39;t get sound working.  I literally downloaded it, opened the server, opened the client, and started playing and there was no sound so I didn&#39;t screw it up some how.  Is there something I need to do to activate the sound?

Thanks for the help!

EDIT: By the way, I made sure the sound was up.  (I played some songs)  I tried several things ingame to test the sound too.  Didn&#39;t work =/  -  And yes I have the sound effects option on :P</description>
