Okay i decided to move on to a DELTA. The base i used was Miir-scape.
It was a good base (since i only coding for 4 weeks now).
But it wasn&#39;t the one i wanted, so i started to edit it and add stuff, add more stuff,... And now its becoming a much better source, less bugs, better economy, cooler to play (we allways have fun on it) verry good economy, much people that want to donate...
So yhea i think this is a perfect way to learn coding. I hope when this project is done it will be an awesome to play source.
Even i ask much help on MOPARSCAPE SERVER HELP topic. Its a way to learn ! 



Things i added: 
[code]-A new Combat game
-much used commands that are used on other servers
-fixed some shops (like cooking,there isnt a shop to buy it, well now it haves)
-Staff shop added more items
-fixed yell tags + added a donator tag
-fixed some bonuses of items
-Making a huge donator town
-added some shops @home
-new places
-...[/code]




I will be adding pictures later !</description>
