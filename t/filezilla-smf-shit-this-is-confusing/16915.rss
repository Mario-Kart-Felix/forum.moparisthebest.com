    <description>Hi again. I am pretty much ok with this all now. But but but, I have made my host with awardspace. I have made a login and i got my password from the conformation e-mail.
I have filezilla, i have the smf folders. 
What the hell do i do next. 
Please would someone be kind enough as to tell me everything. Even using filezilla, i have never used these programs or even attempted anything like this before. Please do help me.
Or if you would find it easier Msn would be better. Please contact me on msn. But don&#39;t add me for silly reasons please.
