    <title>How would I change my client&#39;s Icon?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-would-i-change-my-clients-icon/536982</link>
    <description>[center]Hello Moparscape, I&#39;m wondering how I can change my client&#39;s Icon on my R.S.P.S ( Runescape private server ) The revision is a 317 Project insanity base if that matters any? I already have the icon to change it, But I don&#39;t know how to change it? Can someone make a tutorial or something on helping me change the picture of the client&#39;s icon, I bet a lot of people been asking the same question so it will help a lot of people! Thanks[/center]</description>
