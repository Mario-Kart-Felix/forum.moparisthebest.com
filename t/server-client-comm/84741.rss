    <description>Ok, I think this goes here because its a question, but i want to use it to stop noobs who use the cheat clients out there. It would be easy for a half decent coder t oget around but for my server i think it will work fine. So here is my question, how can i A. set a var in a file in my game client, and B. make my client file for the server check if its var is equal to whatever, and if it isnt then it disconnects the user, if it is then it lets them play, that way only people who use my client can play on my server.</description>
