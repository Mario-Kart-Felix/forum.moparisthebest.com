    <title>Recovery questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/recovery-questions/406365</link>
    <description>Hi,

I&#39;ve been looking to sell my main for some time, but the problem is that it has both recovery questions and an email registered to it. I think Jagex has changed the recovery system and made it so that you can&#39;t remove your current recoveries for some reason. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve tried so far:

1) Account management -&gt; Recover stolen/lost password -&gt; Entered email, and I was sent a link to reset my password = recoveries remain
2) -||- -&gt; Didn&#39;t enter email, filled recoveries correctly, I was later sent an email to set a new password for the account = recoveries remain
3) I attempted to set new recoveries and then cancelling them afterwards = original recoveries remain

What can I do?</description>
