    <title>I have RuneScape client... but what do I do to it?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-have-runescape-client-but-what-do-i-do-to-it/203380</link>
    <description>[size=15pt][b]I AM NOT SURE IF IT IS REALLY IT, BUT IT HAS THE SAME FILES AS CLIENT AND IT IS CALLED &quot;loader583462365&quot;[/b][/size]

I have the RuneScape client on my desktop now... I&#39;m not sure how to run it. (I&#39;m sure not being able to run it has to do with unpack.class)

I successfully got all the files for the client... I hope... the JAR file&#39;s name is &quot;loader583462365&quot;.

Now... I have the following .class files...
[b]a b c cf hf la loader ri unpack[/b]


In the META-INF folder, I have 

[b]Manifest.MF
zigbert.RSA
zigbert.SF[/b]

[hr]

Now, I&#39;m pretty unknowledged in this... but how would I possibly run it?? I am fine if I have to give it to someone.</description>
