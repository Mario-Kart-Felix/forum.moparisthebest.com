    <description>Good evening! This is the Newgrounds Audio Portal app!

[b]What is this?[/b]
This app is the Newgrounds Audio Portal app. It allows you to browse the audio portal and play the songs. You can browse every category, browse *EVERY* page in every category, etc. You can search for songs (which gives 100 results, which should be plenty), and you can add songs to a list of favorites! In the future, after release, there will be the ability to DOWNLOAD songs directly to your phone!

[b]But what is the Newgrounds Audio Portal?[/b]
The Newgrounds Audio Portal is a place where indie musicians may upload their music for community review. 

[b]I have an iPhone, what about me?[/b]
Well, I don&#39;t do iPhone development, but there is an app for the iPhone as well. I hear it&#39;s not so great, however; it costs $1 and it only has the top 5 songs of the week. Or so I hear.

[b]How much does this app cost?[/b]
It&#39;s free! There will be no ads, no cost, NOTHING. This is entirely, 100%, without a doubt, free.

[b]Where do I download it?[/b]
Search for &quot;Newgrounds&quot; on the Marketplace OR click [url=https://market.android.com/details?id=com.newgrounds.audio]Here![/url]</description>
