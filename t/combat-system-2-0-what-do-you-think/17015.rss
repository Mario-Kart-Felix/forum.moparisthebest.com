    <title>Combat system 2.0 what do you think?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/combat-system-2-0-what-do-you-think/17015</link>
    <description>Combat Version 2.0

Will replace these skills: Mining, Smithing, Fishing, Cooking, WoodCutting, FireMaking, Fishing, Agility,Crafting, and Fletching.

Will add these skills: (TrainBronze, TrainIron, TrainSteel, TrainBlack, TrainMith, TrainAddy, TrainRune, TrainDragon, TrainBarrows, and TrainExotic

a somewhat short explanation of the new skills.

If you weild a Bronze LongSword, and wear Rune PlateLegs, you will get TrainBronze xp, and TrainRunexp, it will be like sub-attack skills. The main attack and defence will be disabled. You first must wear bronze armor/weapons you need a lv of 3 TrainBronze to wear iron. 

You must then wear Wear Iron armor / weapons to get TrainIron xp. You need 5 TrainIron to wear steel.

If you understand that, cool :)

Now then, the way the new combat system works is that you could pwn with any set of armor/weapons .. depending on the level of that specific character. here is my best example.

 Username - 1337n00b
 TrainIron Level - 85
 TrainRune Level - 16

           k :)

 With an Iron Scimitar he would hit maybe .. i dunno 21-27 depending on Str level (str level only gives 50% of your maxhit, the rest comes form your Train* level) and then with a Rune Scimitar he&#39;d hit .. 4-7 .. I hope this explains this good enough.

 I have this about 55% finished .. if anyone would like to get in on it, PM me, everyone who helps will get full credits. 

There is much much more to this, i&#39;m just to &#39;lazy&#39; to type that much more right now LOL

so lemme know what you think about this, if it&#39;s wanted i&#39;ll release publicly, if not i&#39;ll just use it on another server



P.S. this means the gameplay for this variant will focus more on melee combat, i havent thought of anything for mage / range along with htis yet</description>

<p>it’s complicated … i cba to explain anymore tho … ummm …</p>
<p>basically it expands the melee system so that each armor has it’s different governing skills, so that each armor type has gives dif effects… as stated above</p>
