Serious individuals who make advances in the sciences with no purpose to them could be given the Ig Nobel Prize. Indeed, the name is intriguing. It is a clever pun. The word &quot;ignoble&quot; is defined as &quot;not noble,&quot; and also the name Nobel can be effortlessly pronounced wrong. There are nine categories of Ig Nobel Prize, which could be awarded for ludicrous discoveries.

 Ig Nobel award champions for this year



The Ig Nobel Prizes this year were well deserved. Anybody who found something ridiculous got an award from the Guardian. This is the list of winners:






* Medicine: The University of Amsterdam had Simon Rietveld and Ilja van Beest who made a discovery. Apparently asthma symptoms are often helped with roller coasters.



* Under physics: Lianne Parkin, from the University of Otago, New Zealand, found that individuals slip less on ice if they wear socks over their shoes.



* Next is biology: Gareth Jones, from Bristol University, found that fruit bats enjoy sex for purposes other than procreation.



* Peace category: Richard Stevens, of Keele University, found that pain is alleviated when individuals curse.



* Category for engineering: Karina Acevedo-Whitehouse, along with collaborators from the Institute of Zoology in London, discovered how to collect whale mucus using remote control helicopters.



* Next is transportation: Mark Fricker and Dan Bebber, along with help from other scientists, discovered how to model train systems using oatmeal and slime mold.



* Next is management: Random staff promotions help companies work more efficiently, according to Alessandro Pluchino from the University of Catania.



* Public health category: The Maryland Industrial Health and Safety Office had Manuel Barbeito discover something. Evidently microbes are collected in beards often.



* Chemistry category: Oil and water do mix, says Eric Adams from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology working with Bp.



* Economics category: Inventive investing gave a joint award to Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Magnetar, AIG and Bear Stearns executive.&lt;/p&gt;



What is next?



The website has a list of the Ig Nobel prize champions. Anybody that showed up to get their prize was on the list. There were some winners that did not want their prize. Some of these were the Ig Nobel 2010 winners. The ones that didn&#39;t show up were expected. These were the economics winners.
