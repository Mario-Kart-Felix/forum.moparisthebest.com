    <description>I decompiled a 498 client just to see what&#39;s going on in there, and I found these:

client.java 
Line 1581 :     static dc ob = r.a((byte)86, &quot;(U0a )2 non)2existant gosub script)2num: &quot;);
hd.java
Line 274 :     static dc Z = r.a((byte)86, &quot;Clientscript error in: &quot;);
ri.java
Line 583 :     static dc S = r.a((byte)86, &quot;Clientscript error )2 check log for details&quot;);

Client side scripting?!</description>

<p>This is from 474 … I haven’t touched it in quite a while so it may be a little outdated.<br>
Cache 12 has all of the “clientscripts” and what not…<br>
I had made a very, very primitive “conversion” class that did something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">[ 0]: PUSH 5 TO INTSTACK
3305 0
4106 0
[ 3]: PUSH " / " TO STRINGSTACK
[ 0]: PUSH 5 TO INTSTACK
3306 0
4106 0
[37]: APPEND LAST 3 STRINGS, PUSH TO STRINGSTACK ["#1"]
[33]: PUSH intParams[0] TO INTSTACK
2112 0
[21]: RETURN

-----------
getComponent(v0).setText(intToString(currentSkillLevel[5]) +  " / "  + intToString(maxSkillLevel[5]))
return {}</code></pre>

The warden itself can be swapped out many times during a client’s connection. Every 15 seconds the server initiates one of the dozen or so scans available to the warden. The warden handles it and responds typically with a  yes/no type response. Very rarely is the response anything more. The connection I was making between the two is that using their cache, jagex can implement something very similar. The codebase wouldn’t have to change, the cache could change and even more they could have it change while the character is playing. This change could implement a new script; runnable in their vm. I didn’t mean to imply that the warden is necessarily scriptable. What I meant to imply that the same cloaking/detection could be implemented using this vm. The strength of the warden is that for a short time upon warden update, the cheater is prone/vulnerable to the scans until the scan becomes cracked/broken and the cheater is protected again. Jagex could do the same thing. For the short time/or long time that they introduce a new script the cheater could be vulnerable. It all depends on how far they want to take this.[/quote]<br>

<p>I don’t share your vision about their future anti-cheat methods.</p>
<p>Jagex usually stacks a bunch of anti-cheat stuff and releases them all at once, yearly, bi-yearly.  They dont invent new ones every week.  I believe the human cost prohibits jagex from going to the length blizzard has.</p>

              <p>Fair enough - I remembered Warden vaguely as some kind of modular execution framework, but, to be honest, have never looked into it or even played a game that uses it. I last heard of it during what must have been the initial fear reaction to a new anti-cheat move by Blizzard. In retrospect, I suppose it would have been bigger news if Warden had been as bad as all that for cheating.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/semaphore">@semaphore</a>: I remember you mentioned quite a while ago that you thought they were building a custom VM, based on their reimplementation of Java system classes. I’ll admit frankly that I don’t know what a VM looks like - would you perhaps enlighten me as to what the markers are? I wouldn’t even know where to begin unraveling this.</p>

</aside>
<p>Warden dosen’t allow “modular and fairly opaque execution of arbitrary code”, or at least, not anymoreso than running a client you don’t have any knowledge of does (I mean the average user here)</p>
<p>Truth be told, I’m not sure where sema’s comparison of the RS client-side script VM (which I know next to nothing about, I might add) and warden are coming from. Wardens modularity/“scripting”/dynamicness is practically non existant, it’s pretty much a standard anticheat system that happens to apply a little polymorphic uh… theory to itself.</p>
<p>Words are basically failing me atm <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=6" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> Sema, would it be possible for you to explain yourself at least one more level deep, even if you don’t want to give out tons of info? &lt;3</p>

              <p>[quote=“semaphore, post:6, topic:206697”]The <span class="bbcode-i">scripting</span> has been going on for quite some time. Searching for “slow” would bring you to the VM method that handles their custom scripting code. They have a fairly robust VM available to them. When I say VM I mean a customized virtual machine. I do not mean the java vm. I mean they have simulated a vm inside the game. This VM handles many tasks within the game. If you remember back around the time when the large array holding the interface cache was changed into a multidimensional array instead of one large single dimensional array, that is around when their custom VM was first implemented. (Don’t quote me on that… I’m saying it is <span class="bbcode-i">around</span> the time. I am not saying it is the exact build number…) It was also one of the ways they vastly improved performance/memory footprint of the game.</p>
<p>Whether this has to do with the messages you are seeing, I don’t know. I would imagine it does.</p>
<p>As a simple point of fact, they are stored somewhere Unhandled. They are stored in the cache. They store the scripts in <span class="bbcode-i">bytecode</span> format. Of course the bytecode is their own VM bytecode. I have to say I was impressed with their VM. They <span class="bbcode-b">can</span> do just about anything with that VM. And once they decide to make the opcodes dynamic, it becomes many factors of 10 more difficult to unravel it from build to build.</p>
