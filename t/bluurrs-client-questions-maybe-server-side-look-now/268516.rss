    <title>Bluurrs client questions? Maybe server SIDE Look NOW?!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bluurrs-client-questions-maybe-server-side-look-now/268516</link>
    <description>Hello...

Im currently usin bluurrs client for my server..

And i was wondering how do i make it so every1 can see sprites..
Also on my server only people with the player rights of 3 can only see there  OWN custom sprites because i changed something in client.java in my server fiels

This is the code i changed in my server files so people can see there own sprites


[code]
				// mod/admin level crown fix -bakatool
				if(playerRights == 3)
					out.write(5);
				else
					out.write(playerRights);[/code]


As you can see if you change the number 5 to a differnt number for e.g 7 people with the player rights of 3 can see there own sprites.. and it would be the donator sign.
But other players cant see the donator sign it would just be a normal admin sign to other players.
Can you please tell me how can i make it so everyone can see the custom sprites and not only the person who has the player rights of 3

Note:I changed the sprites before people downloaded
Note: Im usin deltascape source

Help is much appreciated

I hope you understand...

Thanks
