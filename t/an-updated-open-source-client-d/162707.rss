    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/an-updated-open-source-client-d/162707</link>
    <description>Hey guys! :) Just a quick question.. If anyone knows where i could download the &#39;Hellz End&#39; Client? I heard its really good. If not, could someone please post a link to an open source client that has the updated Skill-Icons, and the Inventory Look with the two pillars on each side? PLEASE..? I&#39;ve been looking for hours just for a nice Client. So if anyone could post a link to a nice client, that&#39;d be GREATLY Appreciated, thanks! :D[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 05, 2007, 01:46:19 AM[/size][hr]BUMP</description>
