    <title>A few Questions for a 508</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-questions-for-a-508/348450</link>
    <description>Hello.
I have a few questions that relate to my 508 private server.
1. How can i change the co-ords upon death? I&#39;ve seen that it takes you to Edge ville in the source I&#39;m using, so i would like to change it.
2. Rather than going into the NPC files and putting the Ids for GWD and then finding the coords, since its empty, is there anybody who could post the NPC code so that GWD will have the bosses, monsters, etc.
3. Somebody please tell me or link me to a guide for 508 Global Objects, (Placing/deleting/etc.)
Thank you.</description>
