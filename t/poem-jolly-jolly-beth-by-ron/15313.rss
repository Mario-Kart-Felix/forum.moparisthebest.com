    <description>[Poem] Jolly Jolly Beth by Ron

This is Gothic Poetry that I was FORCED to write for literature, but I always had a nack for writing poetry so here is my goofy but serious poem. Hope you like it. It&#39;s titled, Jolly Jolly Beth.

Jolly Jolly Beth,
Was close to her last Breath.
She wondered why, started to cry,
then called out for her husband, MacBeth. 
Soon she ran out of Meth,
and finally experienced death.
Jolly Jolly Beth.

Weird huh? lol. Sounds so corny, oh well, I hope I get a good grade. :)</description>

              <p>[quote=“Weibs, post:2, topic:15313”]Scary, yet true, and then a little weird…but well written. I’d give it a good grade, its got a good lesson ;).</p>
<p>Never knew MacBeth was a man’s name, lol.[/quote]<br>
Well MacBeth is the name of a man who tried to become king by murdering the king in the Story of MacBeth by Shakespeare if you read it.</p>
<p>My poem was trying to signify some kindof evil and then beautify it which is basically Gothic Poetry which was the assignment lol. So… Jolly Jolly Beth was what I named MacBeth’s wife, though in the Shakespeare play, they never gave MacBeth’s wife a name. And in that story MacBeth’s wife was a total bitch because she manipulated her husband, MacBeth, into killing the King.</p>
<p>Eventually MacBeth’s wife went crazy with guilt and soon killed herself. I’m showing she killed herself with Meth. And when she was calling out for Macbeth in my poem, in the story of MacBeth, MacBeth was out trying to protect his kingdom which he only had about 5 men left.</p>
<p>My poem suprisingly hits on somevery deep lvls by just using the name MacBeth. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>You are right though therealjdb, it’s a weird poem. Hence… Gothic Style Poetry. :rolleyes: Okay time for bed. Ttyl.</p>
