    <description>Ok, i tryed googling, asking my friends for help and tryed asking people from MoparScape that says they help with ALL problems with PI..but they have fail&#39;d to respond..(Go Figure they just want the stupid rep)...
So heres my problem, im trying to change the DropRate for PI, because it takes about an hour for a player to get a decent drop, can someone please tell me how to change it! or Message me on my MsN Rebornprodigy@hotmail.com
I looked in both the NpcDrop.tsm and cfg it dont say nothing about drop rates so if someone can please tell me how to change it...and no one flame or say spoon feed shit like that, its annoyin as hell readin other peopls topic who needs help..i know some of coding as i fixed alot on my server with PI i just cant seem to find this one damn problem...
and one final request...if someone has a working Jail Command and givedonor may you please give it to me? my givedonor dont work and my jail dont work, it jails them but they can teleport out of there, and the givedonor it dont do nothing at all, because i was going to try getting givedonor to work, than tweak it a little for givemod and giveadmin (or if someone can give me the command much appreciated)
Thank you all!</description>
