              <p>/fail. K, not to be mean… but if you don’t know how to take a screenshot then you obviously can’t code too well. Explain your client… all you said was that it’s finally here and what do you mean finally? was every1 waiting for this “exciting release”? And also if you are writing a thread, use proper language and not fonts as big as hell… IMO, this sucks. Sorry, but you need to do more things. I’m not even convinced you have done anything. But GL next time :P, hope you understand.</p>
