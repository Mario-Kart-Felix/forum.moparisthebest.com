<p>Who the hell cares? I am a person. You are a person. Zezima is a person. WHO CARES! We are people, we shouldn’t waste our time idolizing other people just because they can that which we cannot. We should, instead, spend our time working toward a single goal by which we do not think ourselves likely to achieve.<br>

Dude, use your eyes. I am not idolising him. I am saying that he obviously wears glasses because he’s a nerd &gt;.&lt;[/quote]</p>
<p>How many ‘nerds’ do you know? I hope quite a lot to compare him to them. In actuality, you are putting him down for wearing glasses. ‘Nerd’ can be a derogatory term for anyone who is smarter than you or spends more time on the computer. Say, for instance, you play to many sports. Do you want <span class="bbcode-i">me</span> to be stereotypical and call you a jock because you wear tennis shoes? This is the same instance! You are being stereotypical that all ‘nerds’ (connotation-based) wear glasses. Honestly, open <span class="bbcode-i">your</span> eyes and grow up. I really do not understand how people can just sit their and insult other people. To be fully honest, it is fucking disgusting is what it is.</p>
