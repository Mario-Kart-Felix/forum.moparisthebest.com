    <title>Just installed Xubuntu</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/just-installed-xubuntu/337423</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been using Windows XP for 99999999999. As a lot of people know, as the age of an XP installation approaches infinite, performance approaches zero.
So after getting to the stage that I was about to start smacking my computer to make it go faster (Jethro Gibbs from NCIS reference!), I decided to give linux another try. In the past, I&#39;ve used SabayonLinux and Kubuntu, and potentially something else (the name eludes me).
All of them used the KDE desktop environment, but it never grew on me -- I absolutely loathed it.

So this time I decided to give Xubuntu a shot, because it uses Xfce (which I&#39;ve heard great things about from numerous people). So far I love it. I don&#39;t know whether it has something KDE doesn&#39;t, or the other way around. In fact, I probably like it because it lacks the 9999 customisable features that the KDE environment has. Mind you, this is coming from someone who has had the default windows xp desktop since the last time he did a reinstall. I hate feeling like I have to fiddle with things (and, in my opinion, KDE makes its users fiddle with things).

So yeah, hopefully all goes well. There&#39;s a bit of software I have to get, but that shouldn&#39;t take long given that I don&#39;t do much on the computer anyway (uni work, youtube, irc, general browsing, programming here and there).</description>

<p>If you don’t quite fancy Arch’s customisation, you could also try Fedora, which is also now 686 targeted and so pretty speedy, though there’s a lot more cruft running than in an Arch install ofc.</p>

</aside>
<p>i consider gnome to be in the middle of xfce and kde, in that it still has decent looks and does not require much configuration (if any, depending on how basic you really consider yourself). like, i just changed a few things using gconf and some font settings, all trivial of course. other than those, i did not touch it at all. on the ubuntu topic, you really should just spend a day of free time trying out different distributions. you might find you like others more than ubuntu. although ubuntu could be considered the mainstream linux distribution, distros like fedora or arch linux (if you don’t like configging, do NOT use this since you have to conf the window system using guides pretty much) are cool as well. its like woman, some like them fat or skinny. just like how moparisthebest likes them around 250 pounds and i like them petite and small. (i think it would be safe to say in this instance, moparisthebest likes ubuntu since it resembles the 250 pound woman). <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>yeah, xfce is pretty nice. it does not use a lot of resources and still has that crisp basic ui look to it. i know what you mean with KDE, it is horrible imo. aside from the configuration required, it crashes all of the time on my laptop (yes, i am a cheap bastard and use a like 7 year old laptop :(), so i could never stand it. my two choices are always xfce or GNOME, personally. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> or… just the command line with nano and some app that lets me browse the web in text if i am feeling really 1980’s, haha</p>

              <p>I’ve been using Windows XP for 99999999999. As a lot of people know, as the age of an XP installation approaches infinite, performance approaches zero.<br>
So after getting to the stage that I was about to start smacking my computer to make it go faster (Jethro Gibbs from NCIS reference!), I decided to give linux another try. In the past, I’ve used SabayonLinux and Kubuntu, and potentially something else (the name eludes me).<br>
All of them used the KDE desktop environment, but it never grew on me – I absolutely loathed it.</p>
<p>So this time I decided to give Xubuntu a shot, because it uses Xfce (which I’ve heard great things about from numerous people). So far I love it. I don’t know whether it has something KDE doesn’t, or the other way around. In fact, I probably like it because it lacks the 9999 customisable features that the KDE environment has. Mind you, this is coming from someone who has had the default windows xp desktop since the last time he did a reinstall. I hate feeling like I have to fiddle with things (and, in my opinion, KDE makes its users fiddle with things).</p>
<p>So yeah, hopefully all goes well. There’s a bit of software I have to get, but that shouldn’t take long given that I don’t do much on the computer anyway (uni work, youtube, irc, general browsing, programming here and there).</p>
