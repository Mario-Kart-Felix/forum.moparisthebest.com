    <description>I face a challange.
Firstly a quote from Ali G in da house Da moive
&quot;Heads up to my main man tyler who has been clean of the crack now for 8 years&quot;
I&#39;ve been of the crack &quot;Runescape&quot; for a whole year. Of course i&#39;ve thought about playing it.I woke up this morning thinking about it.
Gah does it befile me.
Ok the Desicion (Sp?) i face is this:
To play Runescape without anybody finding out and act like i don&#39;t and bag out people who do(Not on this forums)
Or Not Play Runescape and bag out people who do(not on this forums).
I&#39;ve sworn i&#39;d never play Runescape again.But it&#39;s got to me.I have to will power to stop play Runescape.
It&#39;s like a herion adiction.You thinkyou need some but you don&#39;t.
That&#39;s what i told my self.But my subconsconius (Sp) has failed me.
Please give me guidance on this matter.</description>
