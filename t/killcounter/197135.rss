    <description>hi

btw sorry that i repost
i was on school when i posted the other one and i did not had the time to exactly explain what i need in the killcounter
sorry

can anyone pls make me a sort of killcounter
its for the following idea
i want it that it count the number of npc&#39;s i killed
and when i have ,lets say 10000 kills i must have a way
to open a command like this
&lt;blockquote&gt;if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;godsword&quot;))
{
if (i dont know what to type here but lets say : playerkills == 10000
{      addItem(godswordid,1)
} else {
sendMessage(&quot;sorry you have not enough kills for this command&quot;)
}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and the killcounter must be in the upper left side of the screen

can somebody pls make one for me or send me a tutorial
i am looking for it for a long time now and i can&#39;t find it

btw sorry for my bad english :)

thanks in advance
