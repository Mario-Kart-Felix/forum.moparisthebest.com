    <title>Seriously? I can&#39;t believe it! Wildy is Back!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/seriously-i-cant-believe-it-wildy-is-back/378791</link>
    <description>Not one person has posted about the wilderness finally coming back!! I swear I have waited for this day, well since they have taken it away from us. There were many doubts as to if this could be done due to all the PVP updates, and if Jagex was just trying to get a vote count. 

Let&#39;s make this a OFFICIAL Moment of Silence, for the greatest thing to ever come to RuneScape!

Thanks for you voting guys!

              <p>Nobody has posted about it in this section because we have a runescape section. Multiple people have posted about it there.</p>
<p>But yeah it’s pretty awesome.</p>
