    <title>Pausing events</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pausing-events/419885</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I was just wondering how to pause or delay certain events. I know there are methods within the Java library that do this, but this will pause the whole server for x amount of seconds. 

It doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be a certain amount of seconds, I just need a delay.

For example if I had:

public void sendMessages() {
    sendMessage(&quot;All&quot;);
    sendMessage(&quot;Help&quot;);
    sendMessage(&quot;Is&quot;);
    sendMessage(&quot;Appreciated&quot;);
}


Between each message I would want a delay, rather than it all at once. 

All help is appreciated, thank you. :)</description>
