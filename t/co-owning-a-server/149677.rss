    <title>Co-Owning a server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/co-owning-a-server/149677</link>
    <description>Hey, I had a question about co-owning a server.  If the owner send me the source, do I have to change anything in no-ip or on my router website or in java or anything like that to run the server? or will it already be configured and will already work?</description>
