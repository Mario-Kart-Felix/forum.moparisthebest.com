    <title>Deleted Minecraft House</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/deleted-minecraft-house/416140</link>
    <description>Well, I just upgraded my Minecraft. To do so, I needed to delete the Minecraft folder. I did so and emptied my trash; then I downloaded Minecraft again. Minecraft 1.8.1 looks great!

Then...I realized I had deleted my single player maps! I had a program try to recover that deleted file, but it was of no avail. I lost my home world that I spent hours on :/

So if you were in a situation like this, what would you recommend to build in your next home/home world?</description>
