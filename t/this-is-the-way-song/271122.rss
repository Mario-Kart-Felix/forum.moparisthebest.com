    <title>This is the way (Song)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/this-is-the-way-song/271122</link>
    <description>A little song, made by me.
I need a first verse, and I have got a bit of the Chorus.

&lt;blockquote&gt;*snip*
This is the way we fall,
From the highest skies,
Into eternity,
Falling forever,
You and me.

This is the way we cry,
Without dry eyes, 
we wait for help,
as we lie on the plains,
Saying our last words, &#39;gain and again.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
