    <title>Log out, then log in for black screen? 562</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/log-out-then-log-in-for-black-screen-562/338463</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using a source that&#39;s base i&#39;m guessing is like Pkevolutionscape or something like that. It&#39;s really good though. However, whenever I log in, then log out, then log back in, it&#39;s a black screen. I&#39;ve tried several different clients, all the same thing happens. Please help. Ps. if you need any code from a file or anything, tell me.</description>
