    <title>Uptime going down even when the server is up?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/uptime-going-down-even-when-the-server-is-up/540000</link>
    <description>I put a server up for a month with 100% the whole time, then it went down for 1 day due to billing issues. I put it back up, and it&#39;s stayed up since. Uptime dropped to 97%, and stayed like that for about a week. Yesterday it went up to 98%, but today it dropped back down to 97%.

I&#39;ve been checking very often, and the server has been up the entire time other than that one day. Why is it dropping?</description>
