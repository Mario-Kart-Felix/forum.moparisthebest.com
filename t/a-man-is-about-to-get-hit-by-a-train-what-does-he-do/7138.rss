              <p>He turns on his battery operated laptop with wireless internet. Luckily the train has a high speed WiFi zone inside so he manages to get the internet working and he logs onto <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com/smf</a> and posts a farewell message because it seems to be the latest trend.</p>
<p>Alternatively, He makes it so his foot gets chopped off by the train and then he sues city hall.</p>
