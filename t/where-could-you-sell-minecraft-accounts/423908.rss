    <title>Where could you sell Minecraft accounts?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-could-you-sell-minecraft-accounts/423908</link>
    <description>Well I have two Minecraft accounts and that&#39;s obviously 1 to many so I&#39;d like to get rid of it and possibly make a little money why I&#39;m at it. Here&#39;s a short explanation of why I have two in the first place, the first being mine that I purchased and the second one is one I gained from a friend who wanted to focus on grades and such so he gave me his account to do with whatever I wanted along with a few things in Runescape aswell..
Basically what exactly I&#39;m asking here, where can I sell my spare account for a decent price of around 5$ or RSGP without needing requirements such as post count or reputation as I&#39;m not active on many other forums and the forum&#39;s I am active on don&#39;t permit selling of anything due to possible scamming.
Any suggestions? 

-Note, I would post this in the Mopar Minecraft website but they aren&#39;t as active as you are on here and technically this would fit under general questions anyways.</description>

              <p>Sure, the account name is “Ignorant_Sheep” RSGP wise just around 5-8M or so not much.<br>
Sheep was my old account but I like the other account’s name better.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
