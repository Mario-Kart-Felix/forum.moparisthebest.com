    <title>Major Security flaw found in Java 7</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/major-security-flaw-found-in-java-7/478216</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Apparently the US Homeland of Security has warned all businesses and people to stop using any kind of Java immediately and disable it


Hackers have discovered a weakness in Java 7 security that could allow the installation of malicious software and malware on machines that could increase the chance of identity theft, or the unauthorized participation in a botnet that could bring down networks or be used to carry out denial-of-service attacks against Web sites.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>I guess they are worried that a group of determined hackers could potentially hack into the company’s websites and modify an existing java applet to attack potentially thousands more systems then would otherwise have been possible.</p>
<p>Its kind if a flawed reaction though because if somebody is willing to hack into a website the chances are they could just insert a modified java applet anyway to achieve the same affect.</p>
