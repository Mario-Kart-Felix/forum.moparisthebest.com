    <title>Monitor not working after</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/monitor-not-working-after/22524</link>
    <description>Hi, I was setting up one of my other computers yesterday and it worked fine about a week and a half ago but was very slow because it only had 128MB of RAM so I threw the other Stick of PC133 128MB I have in there before I set it up. I then turned it only and the monitor didn&#39;t work. So I hooked up two other monitors and they didn&#39;t work on it either. I was wondering if the problem could be one of the sticks of ram. They&#39;re both PC133 and both 128MB sticks of RAM. Any input would be appreciated. Thanks.</description>

              <p>If you have an IGP (onboard gfx), then you might have RAM sharing enabled (sharing RAM with video RAM).<br>
Maybe the BIOS got confused or something from the new RAM. Maybe the second one you put in is really old? Try switching the RAMs (slot 1 to 2, and 2 to 1). If that doesn’t work try to disable RAM sharing.</p>
<p>(This is all based on the assumption that you have sharing enabled :P)</p>

              <p>nah its just a crappy old HP w/o a video card and the monitor doesn’t show up at all so I can’t check the drivers yet. I’ll just have to remove the ram in a few minutes and see if that helps.</p>
