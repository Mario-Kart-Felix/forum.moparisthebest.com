    <title>Simple (?) Logo Request</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/simple-logo-request/144476</link>
    <description>Hey, just thought I&#39;d request a logo for my new site in case anyone was kind enough to help out :)

The website is www.notfrank.com, and the graphic needed is the logo in the top left (currently my themes logo &quot;SoftMC Blue&quot;). The graphic must remain the same height, however can go as wide as needed, really.

There are two choices as to how I would like it to look. Ideally, it would incorporate some feature of the www.talktofrank.com logo, not just a copy and paste, but something that people can look at and think &quot;that looks like that other sites logo, sorta&quot; - this would work, because we are the anti-talktofrank. :)

However, I realise that this is probably difficult to pull off, and therefore will be happy with any kind of logo that fits with the colour scheme.

Anyone willing to help?</description>
