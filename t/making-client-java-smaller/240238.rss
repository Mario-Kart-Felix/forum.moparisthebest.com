    <title>Making client.java smaller</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-client-java-smaller/240238</link>
    <description>So if you read my topic about making java files you already know
but for others I&#39;m splitting up my client.java file because it&#39;s unorganized, and it doesn&#39;t follow java conventions.
(each file is supposed to only be 2000 lines long, my client.java was 25000)
I&#39;m trying to get it as small as possible, it doesn&#39;t have to be exactly 2000. I&#39;m just trying to organize everything so it&#39;s easier to find shit
So my question is, what else should I put into a .java file?
What I&#39;ve got:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Smithing.java
Quests.java
Menus.java
Magic.java
Admins.java
Commands.java
Objects.java
Objects2.java&lt;/blockquote&gt;
What I&#39;m looking for is things that are huge (500 lines+)
Btw I&#39;m using a PimpScape source
(Fucking hate how the idiot that made it coded. He put Z&#39;s at the end of shit &#39;cause he thought it was cool, dumbshit)</description>

              <p>I know it may be harder, but those should be what you should focus on. Those are the most used and called up, and thats one of the reason’s wLs lag, client gets clogged. Separating all the more minor things will help, but the basic structuring needs more attention then anything else.</p>
<p>Oh, I’d add a char creator file as well</p>

              <p>if you mean make those files, ehh, maybe when I’m a more proficient coder<br>
Rights now I’m just taking long lines of code and sticking them in .java file that named to fit the code</p>
