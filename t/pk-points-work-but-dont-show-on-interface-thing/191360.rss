    <title>Pk points..work but dont show on interface thing?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pk-points-work-but-dont-show-on-interface-thing/191360</link>
    <description>ok, so when ppl pk..they kill ppl. it tells them theyre pk points.

like...


[code]
sendMessage(&quot;You killed someone&quot;+otherkillc+&quot;those are your points now&quot;);
[/code]

but when i go to where it says combat lvl and total lvl and where it usually says qp if i put..


[code]
sendQuest(&quot;@whi@Pkp:&quot;+otherkillc+&quot;&quot;, 3985);
	}
[/code]

This doesn&#39;t quite work, it always says they have 0 &quot;otherkillc&quot; points. and it shouldnt, i had 11 and it kept saying 0, i got 12 and it still said 0;

so it always says:

[code]
pkp:0
[/code]


ANY HELP??

              <p>Is otherkillc actually being changed? It may be being set back to 0 somewhere. The code for sending it seems to be ok.</p>
<p>Are you sending it in process() btw? Or somewhere else?</p>

<p>This doesn’t quite work, it always says they have 0 “otherkillc” points. and it shouldnt, i had 11 and it kept saying 0, i got 12 and it still said 0;</p>
