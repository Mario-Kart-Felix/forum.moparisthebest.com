    <title>[Unable To Spawn/Add NPC&#39;s in game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unable-to-spawn-add-npcs-in-game/555015</link>
    <description>Hey guys! Been a while since I&#39;ve posted in &#39;help&#39; section. I have recently started working on this PI server and it&#39;s an old one.
I&#39;m having trouble trying to spawn npc&#39;s that are already added in DB in game. I cannot even spawn a man. Yes, i&#39;m 99% sure I&#39;m doing correctly, in config folder (Server Sided) (autospawn.cfg) You can use the command (::NPC 1) Spawns a man in game, but when you try to spawn it permanently from files it does not seem to work. Could be that my compiler could also be bad, but don&#39;t think so.
I have 3 different compiler and i&#39;m sure they work fine. They compile successfully, correct path too.
Must mention this was a Blank source + Client that I started with. Now having a hard time with &#39;spawning NPCs&#39;

Any and every bit of help is greatly appreciated.
Thank you for your time in advance!</description>

<p>autospawn.cfg. Put the npc data in there.</p>
<p>If it’s not spawning still you A) didn’t put the data in right or B) the parsing code isn’t working, and you need to post it.</p>
<p>As for “permanently” spawning them… You’d have to show us the command. as the command isn’t made to write into the .cfg by default.</p>

<p>No. I have nothing spawned as of yet, I am not able to spawn anything. Blank source here plus ran into some issues which led me here for help.<br>
Here’s what I am seeing on my end:</p>
<p><code>
	NPCHandler() {
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; maxNPCSpawns; i++) {
			npcs[i] = null;
		}
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; maxListedNPCs; i++) {
			NpcList[i] = null;
		}
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; maxNPCDrops; i++) {
			NpcDrops[i] = null;
		}
		loadNPCList("npc.cfg");
		loadNPCDrops("npcdrops.cfg");
		loadAutoSpawn("autospawn.cfg");
	}
</code></p>

              <p>Go to NpcHandler.java and scroll down a bit until you find this:<br>

That should tell you where your npcspawn is located. Let me know if it is the same.<br>
If it is the same, do you have npc spawns ingame currently?</p>
