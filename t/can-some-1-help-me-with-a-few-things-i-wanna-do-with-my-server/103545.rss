              <p>ok i know all these rofl…</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>to changed prices, you gotta go into items.cfg and search for the item you want to change and the first three numbers to the right of that number you change to your price… pretty easy…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to be able to set tele commands you first gotta know where all of your test frame commands are (after them are the beginning of commands) (or you could just find a tele command and after the end of the last } add your command) If you need help on making the command, PM me and i’ll help you out <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>3.To delete doors, you gotta do fedexers “delete object” tut and you can simply do that but changing the delete object to delete door or w e… you may need some coding experience to do the tutorial since like all of fedexer’s tuts are adding voids and you may not know how to add them <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>This is a hard tutorial to make a message come up when you click “talk to” difficulty is like 8/10 because for 1 NPC it probally takes forever to develope!!!</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope ive sort of helped you out for 1. and 2. not so much on 3. and 4. because you gotta add some stuff in order to  use…</p>
