    <description>I need some help with my webclient which is only working for java 7 now and I want  to have it working with java 6 too! also the trade of my server is a little bit bugged like if u do add X it won&#39;t work and remove an item from the trading screen won&#39;t work to, Also if someone else decline&#39;s the other guy still see&#39;s the trading screen. If someone will help me with one of this things or both they can host on my VPS or get admin on my server, to show you my website and server doesnt suck il post a link if this gets seen as advertising then a MODERATOR please remove it : www.artisticy.com ,
