    <title>[HELP] Adding your own Foods, Lag and Not Updating?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-adding-your-own-foods-lag-and-not-updating/328846</link>
    <description>HELP!
Okay I&#39;m experience a Few problems..
I&#39;ve updated a few things such as changing source name, Etc.
I&#39;ve compiled many of times and of course yes, restarted my server.
BUT, It doesn&#39;t seem to Update anything? :| Except making myself an Administrator.
(I Also have a bin folder which looks like a scaled down version of my server all over again And I&#39;ve even changed everything in there too but still no changes?)

Here is what my Run.bat looks like:
[Quote]
@echo off
title The Greaterscape
cd Bin
java -Xmx512m -cp .;./jython.jar;./MySql/mysql-connector-java-3.0.08-ga-bin.jar server
[/Quote]
I was wondering if that could be any of the problem?
(As it looks like it&#39;s grabbing the info from a SQL Server) - SORRY IF IM WRONG. Not too good with this sort of serversided things.


Next, I was wondering how to add your own Food, my food is strored in my potions.java and looks like this:
[QUOTE]
			case 385:
				if (System.currentTimeMillis() - c.foodDelay &lt; 2000)
				return;
				c.foodDelay = System.currentTimeMillis();
				c.setAnimation(0x33D);
				//c.playSound(317, 000, 020);
				c.sM(&quot;You eat the shark.&quot;);
				if(c.currentHealth &lt; c.playerLevel[c.playerHitpoints]){
				c.sM(&quot;It heals some health.&quot;);
				}
				c.deleteItem(385, slot, 1);
				c.currentHealth += 20;
				if (c.currentHealth &gt; c.playerLevel[c.playerHitpoints])
					c.currentHealth = c.playerLevel[c.playerHitpoints];
				c.sendQuest(&quot;&quot; + c.currentHealth + &quot;&quot;, 4016);
				break;
[/QUOTE]

I was thinking &quot;Do I add a new case?&quot; or &quot;Just add it underneath in the same case&quot; And
It was kind of obvious to me that I needed to create a new case, but I was wondering what number the case would be if I were to do make it? (Im fine after I get the case sorted out) So could someone please let me know what case number I am supposed to use (Im trying to add Tuna potato if that helps)?

Finally, I&#39;m not sure if this is because my Internet speed is slow as OTE. Or because Im running a few things at once but it appears to be a very odd lag, it&#39;s not like it freezes or anything it just &quot;Jumps&quot; every second or half-second or so.. 
Not quite sure what is going on there?

All help is much appreciated. Thankyou.</description>

              <p>The code you posted is not the source of the problem, it’s also like that on my server.<br>
It could be that because of your compiling problem, the process.java code wasn’t processed right. Delete your process.class, make sure the correct code is in process.java and recompile.</p>
<p>As far as I know it’s the only working fix, it was released by the person who cleaned up allot of the crap out of Delta, and it has been used by default ever since.<br>
No other problem that I know of causes the same symptoms as you are having.</p>

Not sure if all is correct though:<br>
</p><blockquote>outStream = new stream(new byte[bufferSize]);<br>
outStream.currentOffset = 0;<br>
inStream = new stream(new byte[bufferSize]);<br>
inStream.currentOffset = 0;

<p>I was told that is a source of lag. But not sure.</p>
<p>EDIT: I realise its not just with my character. It’s with Every moving object.<br>
Even when there are no NPCS around.</p>

              <p>Hmm. I can’t stand why the lag problem won’t go away for you <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
I believe its the lag problem where the server first runs fine, but after a few minutes the looks like it just sleeps for a sec, works again, sleeps for a sec etc right?<br>
Hmm. It should be fixed with the code I posted, atleast it worked for me.</p>
<p>Glad to hear the other problems are fixed though <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
If I were you I would keep using my compiler. It maybe be a little messy (but that aint a problem if you are using the program Eclipse for editing your files, cause you won’t be opening the source folder no more), but it does the trick.</p>
<p>Thanks for the compliment by the way <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
I’m just doing the best I can, I enjoy helping others more then actual coding ^^ And I know how much it sucks when noone wants/can help you, got quite a few threads myself which had no responses, still haven’t fixed those errors ^^</p>
<p>Anyway, good luck with your server! If you run into anymore problems, you know where to find us.</p>

Should I continue to use this compiler from now on then?</p>
<p>Also, the only problem I have left now is the “Lag” problem.</p>
<p>May I add, you are BY FAR the most helpful person on these forums and I hope some day I will hold the same knowledge as you :).</p>

              <p>It is correct that the run file is relating back to the bin folder.<br>
The bin folder stores the class files, and these files are the files that make up the actual server.</p>
<p>I don’t get why it isn’t working though, but I think it’s a compiler problem…<br>
Could you try this compiler for me? It will create the .class files in the same folder as where your java folders now are, so it will be a bit of a mess, but let’s just say its for a good cause.</p>
<p>[code]<a class="mention" href="/u/echo">@echo</a> off<br>
<a class="mention" href="/u/title">@TITLE</a> Nightfall Compiler<br>
if exist “%programfiles%\Java” (call :compile “%programfiles%\Java”)<br>
:compile<br>
for /D %%x in ("%~1jdk*") do (set p="%%~x\bin\javac.exe")<br>
if defined p (%p% -cp . *.java)</p>
<p>pause<br>
exit[/code]</p>
<p>After you compiled with this compiler, remove the cd Bin part from your run.bat, and try running the server.<br>
If that doesn’t work either, add the cd Bin back, remove the new .class files my compiler made, and start using your old compiler, cause if it doesn’t work I have no more ideas why it doesn’t work <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>The run.bat is fine, so I can’t see why it wouldn’t update :S</p>
<p>As for the walking lag fix, im currently searching for the tutorial I used, but I can’t find it anymore &gt;.&lt;<br>
This site had the tutorial, but it has been deleted… I’ll continue searching though, and i’ll edit this post when I fnd it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Also, you can’t Rep yet, you need 15 rep for that I believe.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">EDIT:</span><br>
Found it.</p>
<p>Open up your Process.java, and replace EVERYTHING in there with this:</p>
<p>[code]public class Process extends Thread {<br>
public static int cycleTime = 500;</p>
<pre><code>@Override
public void run() {
	int waitFails = 0;
	long lastTicks = System.currentTimeMillis();
	long totalTimeSpentProcessing = 0;
	int cycle = 0;
	while (!Server.shutdownServer) {
		try {
			if (Server.updateServer)
				Server.calcTime();
			Server.playerHandler.process();
			Server.npcHandler.process();
			Server.itemHandler.process();
			Server.shopHandler.process();
			long timeSpent = System.currentTimeMillis() - lastTicks;
			totalTimeSpentProcessing += timeSpent;
			if (timeSpent &gt;= cycleTime) {
				timeSpent = cycleTime;
			}
			try {
				Thread.sleep(cycleTime - timeSpent);
			} catch (java.lang.Exception _ex) {
			}
			lastTicks = System.currentTimeMillis();
			cycle++;
			if (cycle % 100 == 0) {
			float time = ((float) totalTimeSpentProcessing) / cycle;
			}
			if (Server.ShutDown == true) {
				if (Server.ShutDownCounter &gt;= 100) {
					Server.shutdownServer = true;
				}
				Server.ShutDownCounter++;
			}
		} catch (Exception e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}

	// shut down the server
	EventManager.getSingleton().shutdown();
	Server.playerHandler.destruct();
	Server.clientHandler.killServer();
	Server.clientHandler = null;
}
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>Save, compile and test it out.</p>

<p>Thank you so much, Yeah it happens when I walk and I am using a delta based server.<br>
I have changed every server file I own (all Java files) (Obviously not the class ones as they update when you compile if I’m not mistaken). Saying that, I will check if it is a compiler-related problem.<br>
As for the food thing, Thank you very much <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I thought it was something along those lines.<br>
I tried to Rep you, but not sure If I can/How to do it yet? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>EDIT: I realise it is not a Compiler related problem.<br>
I’ve now added Tuna Potato eating but not tested it yet, Thank you <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>All of my Class files are updated so I really cannot see the problem?<br>
Should my run.bat not be something along the lines of pointing the server to my Local files rather than a SQL (Host) file? I’m not too sure.</p>
<p>And as for the ‘Walking’ Lag fix, Do you have a Tutorial you could reccomend ?</p>

              <p>HELP!<br>
Okay I’m experience a Few problems…<br>
I’ve updated a few things such as changing source name, Etc.<br>
I’ve compiled many of times and of course yes, restarted my server.<br>
BUT, It doesn’t seem to Update anything? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"> Except making myself an Administrator.<br>
(I Also have a bin folder which looks like a scaled down version of my server all over again And I’ve even changed everything in there too but still no changes?)</p>
<p>Here is what my Run.bat looks like:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/echo">@echo</a> off<br>
title The Greaterscape<br>
cd Bin<br>
java -Xmx512m -cp .;./jython.jar;./MySql/mysql-connector-java-3.0.08-ga-bin.jar server</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I was wondering if that could be any of the problem?<br>
(As it looks like it’s grabbing the info from a SQL Server) - SORRY IF IM WRONG. Not too good with this sort of serversided things.</p>
<p>Next, I was wondering how to add your own Food, my food is strored in my potions.java and looks like this:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<pre><code>		case 385:
			if (System.currentTimeMillis() - c.foodDelay &lt; 2000)
			return;
			c.foodDelay = System.currentTimeMillis();
			c.setAnimation(0x33D);
			//c.playSound(317, 000, 020);
			c.sM("You eat the shark.");
			if(c.currentHealth &lt; c.playerLevel[c.playerHitpoints]){
			c.sM("It heals some health.");
			}
			c.deleteItem(385, slot, 1);
			c.currentHealth += 20;
			if (c.currentHealth &gt; c.playerLevel[c.playerHitpoints])
				c.currentHealth = c.playerLevel[c.playerHitpoints];
			c.sendQuest("" + c.currentHealth + "", 4016);
			break;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I was thinking “Do I add a new case?” or “Just add it underneath in the same case” And<br>
It was kind of obvious to me that I needed to create a new case, but I was wondering what number the case would be if I were to do make it? (Im fine after I get the case sorted out) So could someone please let me know what case number I am supposed to use (Im trying to add Tuna potato if that helps)?</p>
<p>Finally, I’m not sure if this is because my Internet speed is slow as OTE. Or because Im running a few things at once but it appears to be a very odd lag, it’s not like it freezes or anything it just “Jumps” every second or half-second or so…<br>
Not quite sure what is going on there?</p>
<p>All help is much appreciated. Thankyou.</p>
