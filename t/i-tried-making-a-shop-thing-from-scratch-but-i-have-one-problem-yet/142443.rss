    <description>I tried making a shop thing from scratch but I have one problem yet. I got the shop to work when you use the npc, and I got the inventory to show up in the shop. But I cant get it to let you sell items to it, or buy items from it. Does anyone have an idea on how to do this?</description>

              <p>You have to edit the Shops.Cfg file. That is were you place the “shop items”</p>
