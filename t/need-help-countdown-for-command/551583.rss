    <title>[Need help] Countdown for command!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-countdown-for-command/551583</link>
    <description>To be honest, I am nog really seeking for help, 
I am hoping someone has the knowledge of how to do it.
So here it comes:

I am making a command (owner+ only) ::event, spawning several NPC&#39;s at the home teleport.
Now, I was wondering if anyone knows how to put a countdown on this command (showing up in screen just like ::update 10 p.e.), to give players the
oppertunity to teleport to home because when the NPC&#39;s spawn (after using the command) and you [u]teleport[/u] to that location they are not shown in-game anymore.</description>

<p>So is what you’re saying that when you execute the command, it spawns the Npcs for the person executing the command, but when anyone else teleports there, they don’t show up?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes, exactly. Now, what I want is: to make the NPC’s show up when I enter the command AND also when people teleport to the location.[/quote]</p>
<p>Sounds like there’s a problem with your npc updating. Can you post your command?</p>
