    <title>The Bailout</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-bailout/259260</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;If politicians dither over bank rescues, if countries that can stimulate safely do not do enough, and if fearful investors shy away from emerging markets, the odds of a lasting recovery of the global economy seem slim. And that, in turn, will mean far bigger rises in public debt. A multi-year downturn could easily send government-debt ratios up by 30% of GDP or more.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The real question is what the Wall Street elite will do with the money. From Chuck Schumer and Barney Frank through Larry Summers, the Obama administration hopes that the banks will lend it out to Americans. Borrowers are to take on yet more debt – enough to start re-inflating house prices and making homes yet more unaffordable, requiring buyers to take on yet larger mortgages. Larger mortgages at rising prices are supposed to help the banks rebuild their balance sheets – to earn enough to compensate for their gambling losses.

But this neglects the fact that today’s looming depression is caused by debt deflation. Families, businesses and government having to spend more wage income, profits and tax revenues on debt service instead of buying goods and services. So why is the solution to this debt overhead held to be yet MORE debt? Is there not something crazy here?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

              <p>You can’t let more banks go down. Of course, it’s risky to give them money because you don’t know what they’ll do with it. But you can be sure they’ll fall and take others with them if you don’t give money. Thing is, the U.S already has a mega debt and it’ll grow even bigger. But they’ll fix it with lending money from foreign countries and then letting the dollar fall.</p>

<p>Public debt soars as governments battle financial crisis and recession. Will fiscal firepower work?</p>
