    <title>My new cell phone</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-new-cell-phone/286752</link>
    <description>Alright, I bought a cell-phone from Telus a few weeks ago.
My plan is free weekend and early evening calling and unlimited messaging. I have pay as you go so I get my features online. I recently bought web browsing. I know it costs alot, But I bought it just to get ring tones. (It was 7.50 to access the internet, So I was like what the hell? I have 250 $ on my account anyway) After I bought the feature, They told me to wait 15 minutes for the feature apply. It&#39;s been 2 hours and it doesn&#39;t work.
When I go to my browser, It displays &quot;403: Forbidden&quot; like I had before I bought my phone (Without the browsing feature). Does anyone have any idea what could be wrong? I don&#39;t want to contact costumer service because It&#39;s the third time I did today about other issues. Anyway, Any page I load gives me the 403 error. Does anyone have any idea what&#39;s wrong?

Thanks in advance. 

p.s 
My phone is a Samsung SPH-M540 &quot;Slyde&quot;.</description>

              <p>You might need to connect to a different server to receive your “new” mobile internet. Try and find the menu with your networks services (On my samsung its under applications; yours is probably different) and look for something like “get settings” and you will recieve a couple of texts about your settings. Then when you open them theres an option about saving the settings. Then once you’ve saved all the settings from all the texts you should be able to browse teh internets.</p>

              <p>Customer support gets paid to talk to you, and get paid extra in commissions for what they sell.

<p>For the web thing, are you sure it’s the right site? If you’re on pay as you go, there should be a web browsing fee if you don’t have a plan anyway (on Rogers I know it’s 5 cents per page I think, but I also have unlimited web browsing for $7 a month)…</p>
<p>Try going to Google, just to make sure it’s not whatever the site it’s trying to load.</p>
