&lt;blockquote&gt;Qld Police are to be given the power to issue on the spot public nuisance fines to drunken louts.

Queensland police are to be given the power to issue on-the-spot public nuisance fines, including fines for swearing in public, to drunken louts across the state.

Swearing in public could cost a person $100 and there are fears it would become a major money-spinner for the state.
Experts fear abuse of the power by frustrated officers eager to enforce power on their rowdy beats.

Queensland Council of Civil Liberties president Michael Cope said the new powers were a concern and public nuisance offence rates soar.

&quot;This will become the thing police just slap on someone whenever they aren&#39;t happy,&quot; says Mr Cope. &quot;No one will fight them and ultimately people who are homeless or young will bear the brunt of this.&quot;

Premier Anna Bligh made the announcement following a successful 12-month trial of issuing infringement notices for public nuisance, public urination and associated offences in South Brisbane and Townsville police districts during 2009.

Legislation to allow the statewide rollout of public nuisance ticketing ranging between $100 and $300, will be introduced into state parliament later this year.

The introduction of the ticketing system was recommended in a 2008 CMC report on Queensland&#39;s public nuisance offences.

The CMC found that 60 per cent of summary offences dealt with in the Magistrates Court were offences of public nuisance and that 97 per cent of defendants either pleaded guilty or were found guilty after they failed to appear in court.

Public urination and disorderly offences accounted for the majority of tickets, together accounting for two-thirds of all those issued.

A report by Griffith University, which evaluated the trial, concluded that tickets were a cost-effective means of dealing with public nuisance offences.

Ms Bligh said 46 per cent of all persons ticketed had no previous criminal history and only one per cent contested them before the courts.

&quot;On the spot ticketing for public nuisance offences is a very cost effective way of dealing with low level offending,&quot; she said.
&quot;At the same time it frees up police and the courts to get on with much more serious crimes.&quot;

Police Minister Neil Roberts said public nuisance ticketing allowed police to spend more time on the beat responding to the needs of the community, instead of doing paperwork.

&quot;Inappropriate behaviour in public places is simply not acceptable and police officers are encouraged to take a zero tolerance approach to public misbehaviour,&quot; Mr Roberts said.
&quot;The rollout of public nuisance ticketing statewide will mean that no matter where you are in Queensland, if you&#39;re caught doing the wrong thing you can receive an on-the-spot fine.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

tldl: qld police will hand out swearing fines to whoever they want, no proof needed.

Our government is scaring the hell out of me.. We really need a bill of rights.</description>

<p>Thing is, when you get hurt in an accident, society has to pay too. Think about it: you can’t work, you won’t pay taxes, you’ll receive money because you are crippled, etc. Just because you don’t care about getting crippled, doesn’t mean that society doesn’t. Speeding in the night is just as dangerous as speeding in daylight. You can hit animals, it’s dark so you might miss a corner.</p>
<p>I know I’m sounding like grandpa.</p>
<p>From what I understand from the article, public urination and other nuisances are now illegal. It’s bad that these measures are necessary, but they are. It’s disgusting when a bum is pissing in the middle of a city.</p>

Police have a level of discretion when it comes to issuing speeding fines and demerits, unless the recipient is a red or green P plater.<br>
If that’s the case then technically the penalties are mandatory (which is discrimination, but never mind that).</p>

<p>What are you talking about? They already hide in the bushes to enforce speed limits on highways, and when they catch someone speeding they pursue them, fine them, and take their demerit points. I make a point of high beaming at least one oncoming vehicle after I pass a hidden highway patrol cop, just to undermine their efforts (high beaming someone is the way we warn other road users of coppers in Australia).</p>

<p>What I meant was, nobody is objecting to people being fined for being a public nuisance, drunk and disorderly etc. It’s on the spot fines for simply swearing in public that I have a problem with. The law literally says you can’t use obscene language in public, or within earshot of a public space.</p>
<p>‘Obscene language’ does not automatically mean you’re being a fucking tard and making a scene.</p>

<p>in the states/canada we can literally walk up to a cop and give them the finger and there’s no legal thing they can do about it, or tell them to fuck off–either or. i’m not saying that in a rude aspect it’s just we have the right to say what we want</p>
