    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-help-really-needed-3-things-562/356500</link>
    <description>Just letting everyone know before you flame, i looked in tutorials section, and i have also used the search bar.

1) Okay, this is verrryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy important, the most important subject at this moment. When any of my players die, they KEEP all of there items. I need to make it so they only keep 3, and in pvp they keep none.

2) Another important thing, what file do i go to, to change the stats that some items give? because dragon claws fail massively.

3) I have checked in my npcdrops.java and my god wars bosses and most other npc&#39;s aren&#39;t in there, and i really need to change drop rate for them, where would they be?? in addition to that, is there any way i can change the drop rate lower that 1? because dragon claws and stuff drop wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy to often.

It would be very nice if anyone could help. I have been trying to get this for quite a long time now, and i can&#39;t find the information i need. Thanks! :P</description>
