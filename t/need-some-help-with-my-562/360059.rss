    <title>Need some help with my 562</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-some-help-with-my-562/360059</link>
    <description>well, ive recently gottn a 562 client/source. its pretty good. but when i attack a npc/player, it takes awhile to attack and requires multiple clicks of the mouse. and not just with combat but to open shops etc.

can anyone tell me why this is happening and how to change it please?

the source is RuneSlay

              <p>This happens with mainly, all 562’s so don’t worry.<br>
But you can edit the time. But the mouseclicks i’m unsure</p>
<p>I think this is how to do it:<br>
Open ItemHandler.<br>
And search for any weapon. and where it says attack speed (or w.e) Change it from 5. To like 2 or 1</p>
