-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Hamachi

first were going to need hamachi most people dont like to use hamachi but i think it is easy
efficent and a good way for people to connect to you. Why do you need hamachi well you need
it so other people can connect to your server without it people wouldn&#39;t be able to connect.
 There is another way instead of hamachi, its a router but some people get confused so we will use hamachi.


to download it go to www.hamachi.cc

when you open the page there will be the download part off to the right side of the homepage.
follow the instructions on downloading and place it in any folder. I recommend you make a 
new folder in say my documents and call it (YOURSERVERNAMEHERE).

hamachi is done for NOW!but you will need to use it later

2.Mopar

Well mopar is the way your going to run your server off of thanks to all the great people from there
they created a webclient which is that exact same thing as downloading it but its just online. If you
haven&#39;t already checked it out at www.moparisthebest.com go and check it out.

mopar is done for NOW!but we will also need it later.

3.Source

What&#39;s a source?well its what has all of the server files in it so that making,and tweaking your
server is possible. I personally like to use pimpscape but if there is any other you will like
to use go ahead. I DON&#39;T RECCOMEND STARTING YOUR SERVER FROM SCRATCH IT WILL TAKE ALONG TIME
AND YOU HAVE TO BE A SKILLED CODER!

so lets download pimpscape go to this link http://www.megaupload.com/?d=16KZIJK5
(credits for the link go to lost world)now that you have your source doanloaded
we need to unzip it so either click it or right click it and click extract files here
or to the folder which you want them to be make sure all files are kept together.
you should see alot of files in there unless you know what to do dont touch any except for
compile.bat and runserver.bat.

4.Mod Taharok&#39;s &#39;Perfect compiler

(!!!ALL CREDIT IS TO MOD TAHAROK!!!)

thanks to mod taharok we have a good compiler that works very good. the compiler is what
compiles everything in your server files after you have made changes. To do this you need to
go into the folder with all of your server files that you downloaded in step 3 and right click compile.bat
erase everything in the text document and replace it with this.

that should make it so that your compiler is uptodate and works good.
now that the compiler part is done getting your server started.

5.Getting Your Server Started.

Now this is were hamachi mopar and your source comes in

to start open hamachi and it should be a little box on your screen.
in the bottom right corner of the hamachi program you should see something that looks
like a gear and something that looks like a triangle.CLICK THE TRIANGLE!!dont click the other thing.
once you clicked on it you should see a couple of options and you need to click create a new network.
it asks for servername:YOURSERVERNAMEHERE and server pass:CREATEASERVERPASS   this is going to be what other people
type in when they open up there hamachi so they can connect to your server.
Now mopar comes in either go to www.moparisthebest.com or open up the downloaded moparscape 3.2 with arayn from
moparisthebest.com or moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php     now just leave that running for now.go into the folder that
has all your files you downloaded from step 3 and click-  runserver.bat a black box should appear on your screen
and should say starting pimpscape server on 0.0.0.0 5555-the 0.0.0.0 isent really nonthing but the 5555 means alot
that is the port that yourself or other players trying to connect to your server will have to type in.open up the moparscape
downloaded file or the moparisthebest.com and you should see something similar to runescape with the existing user etc.
go to the top left corner and click file there should be a couple of options click new server.a box should appear.
now open up the hamachi window and you should see at the top an ip address that is the ip that yourself and other
people will use to connect to your server.type in the ip from hamachi into the box that appeared when you clicked 
new server.now click new port and all you have to do is put in 5555.this part is done.click on enter and it should come up
where you have username-password-and serverip  leave the server ip if it dosent have the same ip from your hamachi program then
you yped in the wrong one then you can fix it by repeating the new server step above.type in any username and password and click
log in,if it dosent open something similar to runescape and it says error connecting to server then you either put
the ip or the port wrong so fix them.now you should be done!you can now play by yourself.


6.allowing other people to play.

want other people to play on your server?well follow these steps and they will be able to.

if you dont want to create a forum or a website that will make your server that much better then just read on.
i like to have a forum for a server it makes it look better but you can also have just a website.
if you want a forum i advise you to pick an easy online forum creator i like to use myfastforum.org
so we will use that one for now.-go to www.myfastforum.org and click create forum follow the steps and
create your forum if you would like to see an example of a private server forum visit this link.
drewscape.smfforfree3.com for a website just use an easy website builder by going to
www.piczo.com and signing up and making one.

i told you that becuase that is how your going to advertise your server or you can post at the moparscape
forums and advertise there. Ok back on topic want other people to connect to your server its easy.
All you have to do is make sure they have hamachi and give them the server name and pass that you 
created in step 1. now give them your ip on the top of your hamachi program and tell them to do the same you
did to connect to your server.tell them to use the port 5555.if there is problems with people trying to 
connect to your server pm me and i will help.</description>

<p>mopar is done for NOW!but we will also need it later.</p>
<p>3.Source</p>
<p>What’s a source?well its what has all of the server files in it so that making,and tweaking your<br>
server is possible. I personally like to use pimpscape but if there is any other you will like<br>
to use go ahead. I DON’T RECCOMEND STARTING YOUR SERVER FROM SCRATCH IT WILL TAKE ALONG TIME<br>
AND YOU HAVE TO BE A SKILLED CODER!</p>
<p>so lets download pimpscape go to this link <a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=16KZIJK5" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.megaupload.com/?d=16KZIJK5</a><br>
(credits for the link go to lost world)now that you have your source doanloaded<br>
we need to unzip it so either click it or right click it and click extract files here<br>
or to the folder which you want them to be make sure all files are kept together.<br>
you should see alot of files in there unless you know what to do dont touch any except for<br>
compile.bat and runserver.bat.</p>
<p>4.Mod Taharok’s 'Perfect compiler</p>
<p>(!!!ALL CREDIT IS TO MOD TAHAROK!!!)</p>
<p>thanks to mod taharok we have a good compiler that works very good. the compiler is what<br>
compiles everything in your server files after you have made changes. To do this you need to<br>
go into the folder with all of your server files that you downloaded in step 3 and right click compile.bat<br>
erase everything in the text document and replace it with this.</p>

<p>that should make it so that your compiler is uptodate and works good.<br>
now that the compiler part is done getting your server started.</p>
<p>5.Getting Your Server Started.</p>
<p>Now this is were hamachi mopar and your source comes in</p>
<p>to start open hamachi and it should be a little box on your screen.<br>
in the bottom right corner of the hamachi program you should see something that looks<br>
like a gear and something that looks like a triangle.CLICK THE TRIANGLE!!dont click the other thing.<br>
once you clicked on it you should see a couple of options and you need to click create a new network.<br>
it asks for servername:YOURSERVERNAMEHERE and server pass:CREATEASERVERPASS   this is going to be what other people<br>
type in when they open up there hamachi so they can connect to your server.<br>
Now mopar comes in either go to <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a> or open up the downloaded moparscape 3.2 with arayn from<br>
<a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> or <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php</a>     now just leave that running for now.go into the folder that<br>
has all your files you downloaded from step 3 and click-  runserver.bat a black box should appear on your screen<br>
and should say starting pimpscape server on 0.0.0.0 5555-the 0.0.0.0 isent really nonthing but the 5555 means alot<br>
that is the port that yourself or other players trying to connect to your server will have to type in.open up the moparscape<br>
downloaded file or the <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> and you should see something similar to runescape with the existing user etc.<br>
go to the top left corner and click file there should be a couple of options click new server.a box should appear.<br>
now open up the hamachi window and you should see at the top an ip address that is the ip that yourself and other<br>
people will use to connect to your server.type in the ip from hamachi into the box that appeared when you clicked<br>
new server.now click new port and all you have to do is put in 5555.this part is done.click on enter and it should come up<br>
where you have username-password-and serverip  leave the server ip if it dosent have the same ip from your hamachi program then<br>
you yped in the wrong one then you can fix it by repeating the new server step above.type in any username and password and click<br>
log in,if it dosent open something similar to runescape and it says error connecting to server then you either put<br>
the ip or the port wrong so fix them.now you should be done!you can now play by yourself.</p>
<p>6.allowing other people to play.</p>
<p>want other people to play on your server?well follow these steps and they will be able to.</p>
<p>if you dont want to create a forum or a website that will make your server that much better then just read on.<br>
i like to have a forum for a server it makes it look better but you can also have just a website.<br>
if you want a forum i advise you to pick an easy online forum creator i like to use <a href="http://myfastforum.org" rel="nofollow noopener">myfastforum.org</a><br>
so we will use that one for now.-go to <a href="http://www.myfastforum.org" rel="nofollow noopener">www.myfastforum.org</a> and click create forum follow the steps and<br>
create your forum if you would like to see an example of a private server forum visit this link.<br>
<a href="http://drewscape.smfforfree3.com" rel="nofollow noopener">drewscape.smfforfree3.com</a> for a website just use an easy website builder by going to<br>
<a href="http://www.piczo.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.piczo.com</a> and signing up and making one.</p>
<p>i told you that becuase that is how your going to advertise your server or you can post at the moparscape<br>
forums and advertise there. Ok back on topic want other people to connect to your server its easy.<br>
All you have to do is make sure they have hamachi and give them the server name and pass that you<br>
created in step 1. now give them your ip on the top of your hamachi program and tell them to do the same you<br>
did to connect to your server.tell them to use the port 5555.if there is problems with people trying to<br>
connect to your server pm me and i will help.</p>
