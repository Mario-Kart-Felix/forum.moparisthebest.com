    <title>Secure OpenVPN increases speed</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/secure-openvpn-increases-speed/409414</link>
    <description>I&#39;m at a hotel with awful free, non-secure wifi in Gatlinburg, TN, and needing to purchase tickets online, and with things like FireSheep on the loose I don&#39;t trust this connection, so I connected to an OpenVPN I had setup at home that I never got the opportunity to use before, and I was surprised when it seemed like pages loaded faster!

No VPN, Atlanta GA server (nearest):

VPN, Cincinnati OH server (nearest):

VPN, Atlanta GA server:
[img]http://www.speedtest.net/result/1427306559.png[/img]

So I was even more surprised when it was confirmed, and the VPN is configured with security in mind, not even speed.  I&#39;m using bridging (as opposed to routing), [url=http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto.html#security]tls-auth[/url], and 2048-bit keys, all of which should slow things down.  The thing that must make the difference is lzo compression is enabled on the line.

Also it was easy to setup, on the server, the laptop under Linux and Windows 7, and on both my and my wife&#39;s Android phones (running Cyanogenmod 7).

So, I&#39;m impressed, awesome!</description>

<p>SOCKS is not secure, so if you are on un-secured network X connected to a SOCKS proxy running on anything but localhost, anyone on network X can still see exactly what you are doing, and the administrator of X can even hi-jack anything on the connection and do whatever he wants with it.[/quote]<br>
But SSH -D 808, for example, will create the tunnel listener on localhost…? Or am I missing something?</p>

I’ve only used hotel internet once, and boy it usually sucks monkey cock. I usually just tunnel to my shell when on public networks.<br>

<p>I always used to just do something like this:<br>

<p>But of course that only works with things that can communicate over a SOCKS proxy (doesn’t send DNS requests through the proxy either, generally), not on windows at all (unless I have an ssh client there set up with my private key), and not on anything else like Android phones etc.  OpenVPN really seems like the way to go, because I’ve got it configured to send EVERYTHING through there, and it is supported on the operating system level, so applications don’t care![/quote]<br>

<p>I always used to just do something like this:<br>
<a href="http://wiki.freaks-unidos.net/weblogs/azul/firefox-ssh-tunnel" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://wiki.freaks-unidos.net/weblogs/azul/firefox-ssh-tunnel</a></p>
<p>But of course that only works with things that can communicate over a SOCKS proxy (doesn’t send DNS requests through the proxy either, generally), not on windows at all (unless I have an ssh client there set up with my private key), and not on anything else like Android phones etc.  OpenVPN really seems like the way to go, because I’ve got it configured to send EVERYTHING through there, and it is supported on the operating system level, so applications don’t care!</p>

              <p>I’m at a hotel with awful free, non-secure wifi in Gatlinburg, TN, and needing to purchase tickets online, and with things like FireSheep on the loose I don’t trust this connection, so I connected to an OpenVPN I had setup at home that I never got the opportunity to use before, and I was surprised when it seemed like pages loaded faster!</p>
<p>No VPN, Atlanta GA server (nearest):<br>

<p>So I was even more surprised when it was confirmed, and the VPN is configured with security in mind, not even speed.  I’m using bridging (as opposed to routing), <a href="http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto.html#security" data-bbcode="true">tls-auth</a>, and 2048-bit keys, all of which should slow things down.  The thing that must make the difference is lzo compression is enabled on the line.</p>
<p>Also it was easy to setup, on the server, the laptop under Linux and Windows 7, and on both my and my wife’s Android phones (running Cyanogenmod 7).</p>
<p>So, I’m impressed, awesome!</p>
