    <title>Looking to hold a private server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-to-hold-a-private-server/186469</link>
    <description>I would like to hold a server. My computer is already on alot, almost 24/7. I could probably leave it on 24/7. I would be willing to hold a server. I am not good at scripting, so I would give the person who scripted all the credit for the game.</description>
