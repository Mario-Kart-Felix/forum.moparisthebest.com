    <description>This chapter in my Chemistry class has been very confusing to me, mainly because I never did quite understand the first concept of the chapter. Now, the problems are using multiple conversions in order to answer a question. I was wondering if someone could help me out with this question below:

Determine the limiting reactant and the mass of zinc hydroxide produced when 25.0 g Zn and 30.0 g MnO2 are used.

Zn + 2MnO2 + H2O --&gt; Zn(OH)2 + Mn2O3    (The subscripts are after the element/compound)

I know how to find the limiting reactant, only by looking at a problem and applying that math to the other. If someone can help me out and explain how I can start off the problem, and why do I have to do that.</description>

<p>Thanks for the help. I finally figured out the overall concept of Stoichiometry today.</p>
