    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/extracting-cache-on-a-mac/398507</link>
    <description>I have my client setup for a webclient, im currently trying to get it to extract and locate the ache on a mac, so far ive got it to extract and locate it, but the only problem is, it doent create a new folder and put it in there it just extracts it to the download folder, which is also not the folder i specified, if anyone can help me get this thing to create a new folder and extract the cache into that on a mac then i would be much appreciated.
