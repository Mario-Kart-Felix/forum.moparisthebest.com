    <title>Working Smither(s) and Smelter(s)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/working-smither-s-and-smelter-s/2610</link>
    <description>I posted this on another forum about 2 days ago... But so far no solution to my question. 

Is there a working smelter?

All the fally smelters (That I have, like walktest, supersmelter, etc...) have errors whenever I run them; and I&#39;m not the only one getting them. Perhaps jagex had an update and thus the smelters are outdated, point being, I need a working smelter (in the f2p area  :D)

Also, is there perhaps some smithers? I don&#39;t believe I have any, and I haven&#39;t stumble upon any. If not, could I request one to be made, if it isn&#39;t too much trouble? (Again, f2p one(s) please!)

Thanks.  :P</description>

              <p>it doesn’t do anything… Wait, brb, I’ll edit in my post from the other forum… (I tried it at both banks and the furnace, it doesn’t do anything, just gibberish messages keep poping up (Three of them for the supersmelter), then the screen just freezes, and while I was on two accounts at the same time, the account which was attempting to use the smelter had logged out, but it’s screen was just blank.
