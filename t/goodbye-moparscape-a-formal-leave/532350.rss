    <title>Goodbye Moparscape, a Formal Leave</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/goodbye-moparscape-a-formal-leave/532350</link>
    <description>About time I say goodbye to these forums, I&#39;ve been considering it for a while. No point in participating in a community where your sole purpose is to contribute to it, but the other members don&#39;t recognize that. Too much flaming, spam, Moparscape is out-dated. Rarely do I see people positively supporting members and their projects, unless however, they&#39;re a member that has been here for some period of time. Moparscape is predominantly ran by older members, who shut down the new members, who try to benefit the community. Most of you (I cannot speak for all, there are some good members in the Moparscape community), see someone trying to contribute to the community, if it&#39;s a bad idea, or you don&#39;t like it, or that person, you strive to find something negative to say. Instead of trying to be positive, and wishing the person good luck anyways. Everyone starts at different skill levels, when it comes to website development, server development, networking, graphics, whatever it may be, whether you are a professional, or not. We [i]all [/i]started at the stage of, &quot;not knowing [i]anything[/i].&quot; And to constantly see people shutting others down, especially the new members of the community, really is disappointing. It&#39;s funny, as I&#39;m composing this, and as some people are reading the title, they&#39;ll see the subject, &quot;Goodbye Moparscape, a Formal Leave.&quot; And they&#39;ll take note of the author, &quot;The Web Guy&quot; do they like me? Yes? No? I&#39;m already expecting comments like, &quot;just leave already&quot; or, &quot;no one cares&quot; or even, &quot;you didn&#39;t contribute to the community anyways.&quot; That&#39;s fine, I don&#39;t take it offensively, especially because most of them didn&#39;t even read this whole paragraph. I had an alright time with the community, tried to contribute what I could, but continuously got shut down by older members. Therefore, goodbye Moparscape, and the few good community members on these boards. What once started as (from my knowledge) a JAVA-based community, opened gates to graphics, website development, etc. Then led the way and opened doors for Runescape Private Servers. It was once this great leader and resource, where people can find help, and get the answers they need, from a friendly community. It has now, very sadly, turned into what it is now. And for fun, and making a point, let me show you the types of things that demotivate those trying to learn and excel. 
[b]** These are quotes from recent posts, names have been removed.[/b]

Scenario: A user trying to create a Wiki for RSPS.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Kinda useless.. but you never know.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scenario: A user trying to get suggestions on a RSPS template. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;l2searchbar&lt;/blockquote&gt; (Though it&#39;s a simple question, people feel the need to troll, and make others feel un-welcomed.

Scenario: A user trying to create a top-list site, to benefit the RSPS community.
&lt;blockquote&gt;-says he is going to make a toplist
-can&#39;t add proper links...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I could quote hundreds and hundreds of scenarios where people are being shut down and denied. If you want some real examples of how bad Moparscape can get, checkout the Debates board, or Intellectual Debates.

On a very final note,

Those of you striving to keep the community together, good job.
Those of you new members being shut down, try to ignore what others say.
Those old members out there, who think they run everything, don&#39;t get so big-headed, there&#39;s honestly no benefit from it.

I can only note a short list of members that are higher up in the community, that still maintain a level of kindness to newer members. I sincerely thank those on this list (this isn&#39;t all, I&#39;m sure that I&#39;m leaving a few out.)
* Don&#39;t think I&#39;m favoring anyone, some of these people on the list are friends, some I&#39;ve never talked to.

Also, a quick little list of people who really need to stop trying to troll.

And one more list, power-happy moderators. (inb4 I get banned for this list, because mods get all in their feelings.)
Deathschaos9 

-- That&#39;s about it. I&#39;ll come out and say this, Deathschaos9 banned an old Moparscape account of mine, purely for the reasoning being that I wouldn&#39;t develop for his server.

Take care Moparscape community, though the community and it&#39;s members, will die down at an exponential rate.

<p>Well that’s rather hilarious; ‘Power-happy’. Me? You’ve either taken a large object to the side of your head or you’ve seriously got your moderators mixed up.<br>
Not to mention you reasoning behind me banning an old account of yours is absolutely ridiculous. I’ve almost always been a solo developer and I’ve rarely asked anyone to develop for me and I certainly haven’t banned anyone for refusing to help me. Anyone whose talked to me for more than five minutes will tell you I’m easygoing and laid back, but whatever you want to believe I guess.</p>
<p>This topic is just…  :palm:</p>

<p>:palm: Development isn’t instantaneous, this is a recent development that I started. Sure, supporters can grow as fast as possible. It’s not going to be usable by the public in a matter of days. After a few years, development should be done, and open for public usage, and hopefully, just hopefully, it’ll be known.</p>
