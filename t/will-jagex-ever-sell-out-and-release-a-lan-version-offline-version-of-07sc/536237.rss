<p>All of my software projects are fully open source… the only time I’d close source something would be if it contained functionality that would destroy my entire business model. Anyway, you’re missing the point. Firstly, I wasn’t saying they should open source it - I was saying that public knowledge of their backend code wouldn’t lose them all of their players. If I made a perfect and complete RS clone I still wouldn’t be able to take any significant amount of their playerbase. If I did become a threat to them I’d just get shutdown… so it’s not that big of a deal.</p>
<p>If they made an offline version it would certainly be much more difficult to get the sourcecode than it is from the deobs… For that to happen they wouldn’t do it on Java.[/quote]<br>
Thanks for the facepalm buddy, I’m glad you think I’m an idiot. I don’t think the decompilability of their code really matters. There’s always going to be some way of extracting any secret code/information, whether people decompile the Java classes, read memory or even instrument the assembly. If they don’t want people simply decompiling and hitting run then a deob is fine, but there’s just no point in trying to obfusticate code further by choosing different languages. If they truly have any serious information to hide then they shouldn’t release anything. But my original post was raising the question about what sort of information this could be… to which I’ve had no responses from either of you. (lol models, they’re client-side mate)</p>
