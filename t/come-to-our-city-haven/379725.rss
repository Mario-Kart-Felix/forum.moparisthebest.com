    <description>Hey, 

If you play minecraft then you may be interested in visiting our city, called Haven. The owners are JameskMonger and Aaron_kw_yeung. The population is currently 5. This city is new but is growing at a rapid rate. We have already run out of room foor permanent houses but do not fret we have a 5 star hotel waiting for you. You can just rent a normal suite with a nice view and all your needs or you can splash out on the Luxury Suites which are super spacious and have lovely panoramic views of our growing city. All holiday makers are allowed to use the hotel pool and facilities. Prices are very reasonable!

If you plan to become a permanent resident of Haven we welcome you. As Haven is a growing city we would like your support and you can help us build the city into a thriving community. Although all people must be given permission to build by either aaron_kw_yeung or jameskmonger. 

The server is: minecraft.moparisthebest.com
We hope you visit soon!  :D</description>
