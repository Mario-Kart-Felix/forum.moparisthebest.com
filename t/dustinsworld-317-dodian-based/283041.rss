    <title>Dustinsworld [317] Dodian Based</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dustinsworld-317-dodian-based/283041</link>
    <description>Alright so I wanted to make a source that was worth playing, not 5 minutes and your maxed out.
This is my server, all coded by me. Dodian source.
Im trying to keep the server original, which means no custom items like &quot;Lava Armour&quot;. Because that&#39;s just gay :).
I want my server to be one of its own, not a copy of a devo source.

I got this as a response to my server. I think Im doing pretty good. This is my first source that i&#39;ve coded. Im just learning as I go.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Yousir, are a beast! this server is the best ive seen in a while, its non leeched etc.

I should Rep+ u just for that.
I can see your quite new
so enjoy your stay here on ******
and nice server
good day sir.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[b]I coded this my self, this was a devolution 7 source.[/b]

I give Credit to Dodian/Winten for using his source, I just changed alot.

Some Things I did
-All working skills
-All npcs have drops/spawn times
-Godswords/Bandos
-Working abby rift.
-Gem Crafting
-Working Slayer (Still need to add tasks)
-Server is stable
-Gave items a requirements
-Magic works properly ( You could attack a slayer monster without having the slayer level.)
-Npcs will attack back
-Falador is the Home Area.
-Fully working Karamja
-Working Fishing Guild
-Custom Barrows


Things I still need to fix
-Mining you have to keep clicking to mine.
-Adding Slayer tasks
-Agility bugs/Dcing
-Redo Farming
-Redo Herblore
-Add a mini game? Maybe Pest control or something.


Basicly the server is ready to go, I just need to make some skills more realistic.
