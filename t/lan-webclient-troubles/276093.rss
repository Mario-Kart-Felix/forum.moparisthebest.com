    <title>LAN WebClient Troubles</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lan-webclient-troubles/276093</link>
    <description>I seem to be some problems with a webclient which I am hopefull that someone can help me here.

The basics are.....

My elder children have been playing RuneScape for a very long time now, and now my younger children wish to be playing it also. The only trouble with that is that they are too young to be playing online. And the Windows based client isnt quite user friendly for their ages.

Anyways, I have a rather large LAN network, which is setup in such a way for ease for all my family. They access everything they need via a LAN website.

Then I found out about MoparScape and thought, Superb. I could set up a webclient for my LAN website, where all my family can just click on a link in the LAN Website and Voila. (I am running the server on my LAN aswell).

Well, for the last 2 days I have been trying to get the WebClient to work but to no avail. The basic Client works great, just cant get WebClient to work.

I have followed various tutorials, and still seem to fail.

The Java Error is as follows...

load: class AppletBot not found.
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: AppletBot
	at sun.plugin2.applet.Applet2ClassLoader.findClass(Unknown Source)
	at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source)

	... 7 more
Exception: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: AppletBot[br][br][size=1]Posted on: April 28, 2009, 01:13:41 am[/size][hr] :D I always end up typing too much  ;D

Anyways, any help would be very much appreciated.

Thank You</description>
