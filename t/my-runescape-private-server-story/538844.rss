    <title>My Runescape Private Server Story</title>

    <description>I was really inspired by the other thread, so I thought I&#39;d do my own.

[hr]

Don&#39;t let my registration date fool you, I&#39;ve been interested in the rsps scene since I was about 10 years old (2008) and this is my story.

In early 2008 I owned a server with a friend called pkzevolutionscape and it ended very badly because of a power struggle between me and the other dude. As you can see I basically did all of the &quot;coding&quot; and he did all of the marketing.

I figured that I didn&#39;t need him, so in mid 2008 I went on my own and formed my own server: future-pkz. Don&#39;t laugh. The name sounded brilliant to me at the time. This server made me so happy because knowing that I could get 9 or so players to play on something I thought I worked so hard on was awesome. As you can see, this is a step up from my other server.

In early 2009 I remember playing on and enjoying the fuck out of a server called rangex gaming. Now that I think about it, rangex was just a rip off of another popular server at the time roguex, but I loved rangex because of the relatively small (10-30 players) community and all the nice people. Here is the only video I could find:

I played this server for about an entire year before it got shut down :(

By then it was late 2009 and I was looking for something to do with rsps. After trying to host failed garbage servers and playing on servers that were getting shut down every two weeks I figured that if I wanted to learn more and become a better programmer I should talk to other people who are looking to do the same.

and so I joined moparscape in mid 2010

probably the best decision I made in my rsps career, I&#39;ve learned so much since then and here I am now :) 

[hr]

There are probably HUGE chunks of info missing from this but I honestly can&#39;t recall how many servers I was a part of... too many to name.

One thing I can say is: I miss those days, I really miss the innocence of everything. Yes they were shit, but everyone was having fun. We turned RSPS into a business :(. I really feel sorry for people that didn&#39;t get to experience RSPS at its most innocent time (2007-2011 ish).

Hope you enjoyed this thread.</description>

<p>people were very unwelcoming to me when I first joined (I made nooby tutorials and didn’t take constructive criticism well) so that kind of rubbed off on me and when I got a little better I did the same thing to other people</p>
