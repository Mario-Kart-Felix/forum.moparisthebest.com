    <title>What base?</title>

    <description>Hey,

Erm im not sure if this is the correct section, i hope it is.

Well i was wondering because i wanted to move onto a new server base, and i would just like to know what you guy would suggest,seeing as there are a few bases out. I was thinking project insanity, which i have already done a little work on.

Thanks for reading

So what base would you say ?</description>
