    <title>Server disconects when you log</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-disconects-when-you-log/259865</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve had this particular server going perfectly for a few weeks, and all of a sudden as soon as you log in it disconnects you. It does this for every player and It&#39;s not making much sense to me. 

There are no errors when i compile (although I didn&#39;t think that was the problem)

Does anyone know how you fix that? I&#39;m unsure where i went wrong</description>

              <p>I guess yeah that’s possible it just doesn’t make sense to me because it doesn’t say error connecting to server or anything. It logs me in everytime it just disconnects you immediately.</p>

              <p>It could be your memory running out or I could be totally wrong. After I ran my server for a while it got to the point where it was harder to get in and it would say “error connecting to server” because I was running out of memory. But my server’s been off lately.</p>
