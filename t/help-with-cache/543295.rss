    <title>Help with Cache</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-cache/543295</link>
    <description>Hello, for months i am trying to find out about cache, how to place it in the right place so others can actually play it.

What I have done:

Edited server a bit
Port forwarded (port checker says its online and I can login into the client)
Made a jar client and a webclient (but have no idea how to make webclient work on website)
Client is working for me, but when i tried on other pc it didn&#39;t. In the case when it stops on loading screen its an obvious cache problem which i need help with.

Client+ source is Aggroth

The help would make me very happy, please help if you can:
