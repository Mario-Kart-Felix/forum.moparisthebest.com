    <title>Black Ops map pack First Thoughts</title>

    <description>Well to start with, the new Zombies map is great in my opinion. I love the new Gersch device, and the Stamina perk is cool when you have a pack-a-punched RPK.

PhD flopper is quite confusing, I read somewhere that you make an explosion when you dolphin dive. Sounds quite cool, I guess. The Lunar landers are a great form of escape, similar to the teleporters but a little slower and costing more (only 250). Getting all of the landers to access the pack-a-punch was not a challenge with four players.

The monkeys were kind of retarded IMO. The fact that you cannot keep your perks for more than a few rounds seems pretty stupid. I think it would have been better if it would have taken just one perk.

As for the multiplayer maps, I&#39;m disappointed with Kowloon and Stadium. There&#39;s not enough balance of open spaces and close range engagements, but I can&#39;t really judge as I have only played them on combat training.

              <p>Saw the youtube trailer for it. Can’t wait for some extra cash to buy it. It looks sick IMO. I like how they support snipers as I will be working on some sniper videos soon. Also would like to see a casino map in the near future.</p>
