    <description>What would I need to type into a shortcut to get it to shutdown the computer. I have tried &quot;shutdown /i&quot; at school. It opened up a cmd prompt and then immediatly closed it. Is there another command that would get the computer to shutdown or is there an alternative batch file that would get the computer to shut down.</description>

              <p>thx for the file. the problem is that the school computers don’t allow access to the C drive. But that isn’t a problem because the icon on the desktop is deletable. So it makes everything easier. I still have doubts that the shutdown command will work because of access restrictions. The earlist chance I have to test this would be on friday. I’ll post an update on how it goes. maybe is screenshots.</p>

              <p>Delete it and then replace it with the shortcut. I tried, on my computer at school, creating a shortcut with the location as “shutdown -s -t 10 -c haha” but all that came up was a Cmd window then it closed just after it appeared. I’m gunna try to get a screenshot of what it says before it dissapears. Probably don’t have access or something. I’ll try to create a batch file on the network in some random folder and then also have the shortcuts in that folder. Then I’ll get someone to distract the victim and then replace his icons with the shortcuts. But I have doubts the shutdown batch file will work. I created another batch file to test it and that file was as follows.</p>
<p><code>color 1a
start system.bat
start system.bat
start system.bat
</code><br>
System.bat was the name of the batch file. But the problem was that the CMD window didn’t change color and there seemed to be a message there. I could turn off echo which might help to find out what the message is.</p>

              <p>I had a better idea. I was going to create shortcuts on the desktop to either shutdown the computer or link to a batch file that shutsdown the computer. After reading some guide about how to hide folders by changing the icon, I decided I could do that to the short cut I’m making. But I would make the picture of the shortcut like the My Computer picture and name it “My Computer” and would do that with the other files on the destop. Which brings me to another question: can I delete the My Computer icon?</p>

<p>Right click the desktop and make a new text document. Rename it to “file.bat” Then copy and paste that code into the file and save it. Now run that file and it will instantly shut down your computer.</p>

Is there an advantage in giving a delay?  If you’re going to enter the command to shut down, you should (hopefully) be ready for it.  Unless you have a chance to stop the shutdown in that 1-2 seconds, I don’t see a need to include a delay.</p>
