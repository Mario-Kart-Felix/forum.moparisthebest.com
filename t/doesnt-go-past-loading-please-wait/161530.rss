    <title>Doesn&#39;t go past &quot;loading please wait...&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/doesnt-go-past-loading-please-wait/161530</link>
    <description>Hey, my server now has some issues and it&#39;s not letting players log on... Like it won&#39;t go past the &quot;Loading please wait...&quot; part... And 1 of the players that mentioned that said that it might be because of the ::starter pack I recently added... But then it might be the silabs too since of all the new items...

Okay Edit: I tried it on my downloaded client and it works... it seems that it&#39;s just the webclient?</description>
