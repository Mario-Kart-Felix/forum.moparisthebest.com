    <title>[RESOLVED - DENIED] New Board: Programmer Autobiographies</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/resolved-denied-new-board-programmer-autobiographies/538933</link>
    <description>This seems all too common...why not? 

I&#39;m willing to bet there&#39;s plenty of people who are interested in the lives of 9-14 year olds. There&#39;s clearly much to be known behind the hard-working individuals in the RuneScape 2 Development section. 

Anyone agree?</description>

<p>Why? I don’t even read 95% of the bullshit that’s on my facebook feed, so why would I waste my time reading your blog? I don’t care about your <span class="bbcode-i">struggles</span> that made you become the developer you are today. I don’t care what you had to do to gain access to a computer and the internet.

I’ve seen more ‘dramatic’ stories about peoples backgrounds with technology than basically anything someone from mopar could produce without exaggeration or lies.<br>
How about that kid in Africa that used junk to create a radio transmitter? His ‘background’ is surely more worse than the background of kids here on mopar.</p>

[/quote]If you actually read my blog you would find that I was abandoned at birth in the African outback, and I had to earn a living by selling my body to tourists and the white men that came over for the mining industry. Once I earned my first $150 (probably worth around $180USD now) I bought my first computer… an Acorn 803-80. I used this to develop an enterprise-scale CMS which was eventually bought by Adobe for $2m USD. I now write multi-billion dollar software for BAE Systems and IBM, and act as a role model for the children growing up in my home town.[/quote]<br>
