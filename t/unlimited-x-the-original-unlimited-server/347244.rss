[b]Unlimited X
The Original Unlimited Server[/b]

This project has been in development for quite some time now, around 10 months to a year. I&#39;ve been developing it with numerous programmers for a while, but we have all dropped out at certain points. I&#39;m currently the only one on the team developing the Server/Client, with forum-side development by Trevor

This project won&#39;t be like the others, (Quit after a week, couldn&#39;t fix a stability bug, never gets released, and so forth). Although I can&#39;t gaurentee I will be updating constantly/managing the thread all the time. I can assure you that development will not stop until it&#39;s finished.

[CENTER]Aims &amp; Goals[/CENTER]

[*]A fun, economic, enjoyable skilling &amp; playerkilling server
[*]Realistic gameplay
[*]Minimum to no glitches or bugs that will ruin the fun of the server
[*]No half-assed work such as skills or playerkilling features
[*]Proper formulas and calculations
[*]Good stability and uptime
[*]A hard working staff team, that actually helps players in need and can manage to keep the server and forums under control
[*]A nice, and enjoyable community
[*]Just something different in all hopes

NPC Clipping
[URL=http://&quot;http://tinypic.com/player.php?v=s5z3aq&amp;s=5&quot;]NPC Clipping[/URL]

The clipping isn&#39;t that new tiles.put shit, it&#39;s my own method. Here&#39;s a example of how it&#39;s done:
[CODE] (This has been modified so it will not work for you,
 if you can figure out how to get it working you can use it, 
but you&#39;ll need the other methods and the data)

    public boolean Unwalkable(int x, int y, int x2, int y2)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; LOADED_OBJECTS; i++)
        {
            if (x == ObjectX[i] &amp;&amp; y == ObjectY[i])
            {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
(This is not the full code, or how its correctly setup)

it just makes it so the objects and walls and such loaded 
are unwalkable, although object sizes are not yet implemented.
[/CODE]

Realistic Combat
(Getting as close as my abilities will allow me to perfect combat).
Magic+Melee (Rushing):
