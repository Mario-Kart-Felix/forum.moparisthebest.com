I am look for a specific rsps.. I have looked for days on the server downloads page but I just cant find them... LOL i have looked through soo much but I haven&#39;t looked through all of them because there is sooo much so i need your help!!

I am trying to look for a rsps that is 508 with the home, EDGEVILLE
SHOPS IN EDGEVILLE
PK POINT SHOPS IN EDGEVILLE
But it has all like KBD, Jad, etc....
Umm, it has good working ::commands, Not many updates needed, Not many glitches in the game...
AND the teleport tab has all like, CITY TELEPORT, etc..

If you can find anything like that that would BE SOOOOO AWESOME!!!! :) I would love you for ever &lt;3 no homo if your a boy...

<p>Thats why I am asking here… <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> lol[/quote]You could at least have posted in General Questions…lol. What you want in your server is what noobs change to call “their” server. Look for a good, solid source that you can modify to your wants. Use the Server Tutorials section to change or add what you want.</p>
