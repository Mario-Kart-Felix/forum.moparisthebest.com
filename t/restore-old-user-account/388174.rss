    <title>Restore old user account?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/restore-old-user-account/388174</link>
    <description>I was trying to do something on a friends computer and screwed it up.
A new user was created with the same name, however it is located at JohnDoe.Aspire3690, instead of JohnDoe. I tried to copy over the files frm JohnDoe to the new folder however this leads me to get errors when trying to run explorer.exe from within this account. It works from within safe mode, but without it I don&#39;t really know what to do. The OS is windows 7 and I ran a program that was meant to change the SID, but it stalled part way through. Is there anything I can do to restore the old user? Sorry this is a bit jumbled in a hurry
edit: maybe in safemode its the original account? the pinned taskbar icons are the same</description>

EDIT: That didn’t work. Something else of note is that when I try to log in through regular windows, as soon as I hit enter after the password it tells me it’s logging off. However in safe mode it loads and works just fine.</p>

              <p>Thanks Newty, but that’s not so much it… the files still exist, it’s just I don’t have access to the account for some reason. C:\Users\JohnDoe (location of original account) is still accessible, just when windows is booted into normally i can’t log in to that account. However in safe mode, it is what I am logged into (I tested this by deleting JohnDoe.Asire3690, and found that I still have access to the previously made documents.)</p>

<p>Notably:</p>
<blockquote>You can get programs which will attempt to recover your deleted files.
<p>Here is a link to one:<br>
<a href="http://www.piriform.com/recuva" data-bbcode="true">Recuva - Undelete, Unerase, File and Disk Recovery - Free Download</a><br>
This is made by the guys who make CCleaner.</p>
<p>I haven’t tried Recuva, I use a program called Pandora Recovery.<br>
If you haven’t added too many files or defragged your HDD, you might be able to get most of your files back. Good Luck!</p>
