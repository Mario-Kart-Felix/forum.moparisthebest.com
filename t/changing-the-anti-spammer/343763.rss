    <title>Changing the Anti Spammer?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-the-anti-spammer/343763</link>
    <description>Ok so me and my 2 friends run this server but were all room mates and when the server is on only 2 of us can log in at a time because of the anti spammer thing. Any help?

And on the client we can&#39;t remove the flames because the method58(whatever) doesn&#39;t even exist in there

Let me know if you can help</description>
