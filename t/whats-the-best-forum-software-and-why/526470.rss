    <title>What&#39;s the best forum software and why?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whats-the-best-forum-software-and-why/526470</link>
    <description>Yes, this is debatable. I&#39;ve always thought that smf and vBulletin were the better of the options out there. But I know not everyone agrees with me :P


So have at it. I want to see actual reasoning behind everyone&#39;s idea on what they think is the best.

Here&#39;s mine:
SMF: Open source. Easy to use. Customization. Community based modifications, customization&#39;s, and themes. Typically not bad on the eyes. And it&#39;s pretty secure for free software.

vBulletin: (Can be) clean. Sleek (depending on who&#39;s in control, some just throw everything everywhere). Powerful (in terms of options). Unique (I&#39;ve seen a lot on vB that hasn&#39;t been done on others). And it&#39;s very restrictive (Meaning the forum admin can add lots of controls and edits for the forum to not allow people to do things).

Here&#39;s some of the thousands of forum software out there:

phpBB, vBulletin, SMF, IP.Board, XenForo, MyBB, ASPPlayground.Net, Vanilla Forum, YaBB, Tal.Ki</description>

              <p>At one point I was really into SMF, to the point of nearly getting on the team. I still use it to this day for my own forum, so that’s my choice. <em>kind of</em></p>
<p>As people have mentioned, SMF is lite, powerful, and easily customizable. Installing mods is a breeze and most things just work without much effort. Some will say that SMF is “lacking” in the theme department, but that’s not really a big deal. If you’re going to spend hundreds of dollars on a vbulletin license, and end up with a pile of absolute crap on your server, then just do yourself a favor, install SMF, and use that SAME money you were about to buy some complete rubbish with on a custom theme! You can just hire someone to make a theme EXACTLY as you want it for you and you alone! You can then even remove all the copyrights on the footer of your forum. As of SMF 2.0 Gold and on wards, it is perfectly legal to remove the copyright from the forum. The only consequence is you won’t be offered support on their forum, but you could just turn the copyright back on if you ever needed support.</p>
<p>So there’s literally no reason not to use SMF instead of vBulletin, or even IP.B (though if you have to, please please please just use IPB…)</p>
<p>Now, the main problem with SMF as of right now is they no longer have a team with any real coders…As a matter of fact, I’d go so far as to call one of their current “devs” nothing more than a script kiddie. But the worst part is he swears he’s the best thing that ever happened to web development. <em>sigh</em> For that reason, I do not plan to ever upgrade SMF past 2.0 (no 2.1 for me, sorry) However, I would advise people to have a look at this SMF fork:</p>
<p><a href="http://wedge.org/pub/faq" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://wedge.org/pub/faq</a></p>
<p>I know the people behind it (Arantor and Nao) and can say they’ll release a quality product when it’s ready.</p>
<p>Bottom line, for now, SMF is king in my book, but once 2.1 comes out, I’m done with it.</p>

<p>80% I’m pulling it from the fact that I’ve never really experienced any other paid forum software, hahaha. And yeah, the code for vBulletin is horrible, and not structured very well (or at least to my liking). I think it has a pretty nice front-end design though, and easy for people who don’t want to go deep into thousands of lines of code to change minor things on the forums.</p>
<p>** EDIT: If I was using SMF and someone offered me a free vBulletin license, I would stick with SMF.<br>

The frontend of something will rarely matter if it’s been defaced because of someone cracking an insecure hashing algorithm ;). From what I can remember (this is going back a bit) IPB is decent enough code-wise, but requires a high performance server to run it to full capacity and is often slow on load depending on PC. XenForo was pretty good all-round and probably the best choice to take, or at least of the 3 most popular forums.[/quote]<br>
Yeah, IPB sucks, have you ever been on rsbot’s site? It’s filled with .gif siggy’s and shit, plus the animated theme kills overall load. Most of the time their software bugs out. Honestly nasty, horrid and not well ran.<br>
This RSPS I played, used a cracked copy of ipb, and it had loads of errors (I assume from bad cracks…), like the page wouldn’t correctly auto refresh, the shoutbox was broke, and so many things.<br>
I know powerbot’s site is paid for, but it is made to look pretty, not run pretty.</p>

<p>I’ve been helping out a friend with his server; previously we were running vB 4.2 and oh my god it was so horrible. It is probably the most overrated piece of software in existence, it has a horrible password hashing algorithm, slow (at least on 4x), clunky, god awful ACP that packs 90% of the settings into a single unorganized drop down menu and is riddled with exploits.</p>
<p>imo about the only thing going for vB is the community, however quite a few of the other softwares rival it.</p>

And yeah, the code for vBulletin is horrible, and not structured very well (or at least to my liking). I think it has a pretty nice front-end design though, and easy for people who don’t want to go deep into thousands of lines of code to change minor things on the forums.</p>
<p>** EDIT: If I was using SMF and someone offered me a free vBulletin license, I would stick with SMF.</p>

<p>Everyone has their own opinions, it really just depends on what they’re best at working with. Me, personally, am best with SMF. I find it simple and easy to work with and implement with other parts of a website. MyBB allows you to easily customize the forum’s design with a nice and easy GUI.</p>

              <p>I just made the change over to MyBB to give it a try and I like it; it’s customizable (so if SMF) and there is a decent selection of themes and plugins that are free.  Sure, it’s a bit annoying to manually have to upload the plugin through a FTP or something like it and not a build in plugin manager, but that’s not a huge deal.</p>
<p>Overall, I like both MyBB and SMF.</p>

<p>My last two forums I used MyBB, before that I was using SMF.</p>
<p>The main thing I loved about MyBB was how easy it was to make modifications for it (and as others pointed out it has a lot of really nice themes) and modify the styles/templates. SMF just isn’t as good in that way. But SMF is definitely lite and the SSI can be really helpful, but with MyBB templates you can create something similar pretty easily.</p>
