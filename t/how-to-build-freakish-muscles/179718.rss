    <description>[b][size=14pt]Build Freakish Muscles:[/size][/b]

Irrespective of gender, every physique has the capacity to build big muscle, provided it is trained and given rest at proper periods. There are countless build-rock-hard-muscle formulas on the Internet, promising guaranteed satisfaction or your money back, accompanied by pictures of guys who have added thirty pounds of muscle in just twelve weeks. Ignore them. Here are some genuine muscle-building tips to help you get awesome and ripped.


[ul][li][b]Allow your body adequate time to recuperate between training sessions. One of the pitfalls of &quot;hard gainers&quot; (those who build muscle slowly) is overtaining. Go to the gym for an hour, three to four times a week. Never go two days in a row. This allows your body time to rest, keeps you from getting bored, and enables you to be more focused when you are working out.[/b][/li]

[li][b]Perform low reps with high weights, but remember that good form is more important than the amount of weight you are lifting. You can only target muscle if you can control the weight. if your dumbbell curls look like jerks, you&#39;ve got bad style. Lowe the weight and stop trying to impress other gym users cause then you will just look like a jackass.[/b][/li]

[li][b]Use free weights instead of machine and cable exercises.[/b][/li]

[li][b]Surprise your muscles and keep your training fresh by varying the exercises, the number of reps, the tempo of the reps; and by gradually increasing the weight every couple of weeks. You&#39;ve got to mix things up to make maximum gains. Train to total muscle failure on at least a few sets every workout.[/b][/li]
[li][b]Don&#39;t waste time training your abs to get a six pack. Fat is burned all over the body when you train, not just in certain areas. Lose weight and your six pack will appear.[/b][/li]

[li][b]Eat at least two grams of protein per pound of body weight. If you weigh 150 pounds, you need to eat at least 300 grams of protein. Eat a small meal every two to three hours.[/b][/li]

[li][b]Drink at least eight glasses of water a day and get at least eight hours of sleep each night.[/b][/li]

[li][b]Inject yourself daily with HGH (Human Growth Hormone), a 191-amino acid, single chain polypeptide that occurs naturally in the human body and is produced by the pituitary gland. What&#39;s the worst that can happen? Your bones growing out of shape and heart disease? A small price to pay for freakish muscle growth.[/b][/li][/ul]</description>

              <p><span class="bbcode-b">[size=14pt]Build Freakish Muscles:[/size]</span></p>
<p>Irrespective of gender, every physique has the capacity to build big muscle, provided it is trained and given rest at proper periods. There are countless build-rock-hard-muscle formulas on the Internet, promising guaranteed satisfaction or your money back, accompanied by pictures of guys who have added thirty pounds of muscle in just twelve weeks. Ignore them. Here are some genuine muscle-building tips to help you get awesome and ripped.</p>
<p>[ul][li]<span class="bbcode-b">Allow your body adequate time to recuperate between training sessions. One of the pitfalls of “hard gainers” (those who build muscle slowly) is overtaining. Go to the gym for an hour, three to four times a week. Never go two days in a row. This allows your body time to rest, keeps you from getting bored, and enables you to be more focused when you are working out.</span>[/li]</p>
<p>[li]<span class="bbcode-b">Perform low reps with high weights, but remember that good form is more important than the amount of weight you are lifting. You can only target muscle if you can control the weight. if your dumbbell curls look like jerks, you’ve got bad style. Lowe the weight and stop trying to impress other gym users cause then you will just look like a jackass.</span>[/li]</p>
<p>[li]<span class="bbcode-b">Use free weights instead of machine and cable exercises.</span>[/li]</p>
<p>[li]<span class="bbcode-b">Surprise your muscles and keep your training fresh by varying the exercises, the number of reps, the tempo of the reps; and by gradually increasing the weight every couple of weeks. You’ve got to mix things up to make maximum gains. Train to total muscle failure on at least a few sets every workout.</span>[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-b">Don’t waste time training your abs to get a six pack. Fat is burned all over the body when you train, not just in certain areas. Lose weight and your six pack will appear.</span>[/li]</p>
<p>[li]<span class="bbcode-b">Eat at least two grams of protein per pound of body weight. If you weigh 150 pounds, you need to eat at least 300 grams of protein. Eat a small meal every two to three hours.</span>[/li]</p>
<p>[li]<span class="bbcode-b">Drink at least eight glasses of water a day and get at least eight hours of sleep each night.</span>[/li]</p>
<p>[li]<span class="bbcode-b">Inject yourself daily with HGH (Human Growth Hormone), a 191-amino acid, single chain polypeptide that occurs naturally in the human body and is produced by the pituitary gland. What’s the worst that can happen? Your bones growing out of shape and heart disease? A small price to pay for freakish muscle growth.</span>[/li][/ul]</p>
