    <title>508 HD client doesen&#39;t work on HD source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-hd-client-doesent-work-on-hd-source/297742</link>
    <description>Alright i got the Davidscape 508 source, it says its HD on the post, and there is an HD and LD client download on the post to, but whenever i run the server, and try to log on using the HD client the server says:
Connection received from: 127.0.0.1
But i don&#39;t Actually go past the:&quot;Connection to update server&quot; loading...
also with another HD client witch is full screen, it completes the loading but hen i change the server to my server and try to log in it says error connecting to server...
Yes i have titana cache, and i&#39;ve put the cache085 file in the titana cache folder on:C:\Windows\.titana_cache
Yes I&#39;ve tried another source, witch is ONLY HD (i think, since i couldn&#39;t connect using LD)

Sure the server works in LD, but if i wanted it to be LD then i would make a 317 server, please help.</description>
