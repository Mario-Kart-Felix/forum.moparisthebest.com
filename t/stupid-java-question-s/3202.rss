    <title>Stupid Java Question(s)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stupid-java-question-s/3202</link>
    <description>Well, here&#39;s my stupid Java question (actually it&#39;s a bunch of stupid Java questions) and a little bit of the story behind it:

My friend and I were in our programming class and I was trying to help him debug his program.  One thing I came across in his code was that he calls for random numbers in a completely different way than I do.

When he wanted to set an int to a random value he would do:
[code]
int randomNumber = (int) (Math.random() * #)
[/code]

However, when I want to make a random number, I create a Random object from the java.util package:
[code]
import java.util.Random;
Random gen = new Random();
int randomNumber = gen.nextInt(#);
[/code]

I know that both methods create a random number, I just prefer to do mine in the latter form; that&#39;s just my coding &quot;style&quot; as my teacher calls it.

As for my stupid questions here goes:

-What Java&#39;s method for determining &quot;random&quot; number?  
I&#39;ve been looking all over the place and I can&#39;t find out how the numbers are determined.  I know that this question isn&#39;t all the important, I was just kind of wondering.

-Are the same methods for determining random numbers used in both instances or are two different processes used?

-Is there any advantage of using one method of generating a random number over the other?


Like I said before, these questions are not vitally important or anything.  I&#39;m just wondering if anyone could explain this to me or point me in the right direction as to where to look for the answers.  Right now I just have a little too much time on my hands.

Thanks for your help.

<p>The only difference, therefore, between your two codes are that Math.random() calles Random.nextDouble() while you specify to call nextInt()…there’s no definate advantage of using one method over the other but for personal preference (unless you want to get a random value for a different primitive type or want to manually want to set the seed, in which case you’d create your own java.util.Random object.</p>

              <p>Java uses the current time to determine random numbers. They get the time, along with an int that increments everytime the method is called, and pass them through a meathod or two. It then returns the numbers. I dont know how they are different, but I do know more about the Random class than the Math.random() method.</p>
<p>The Random class uses the System.currenttimeNanos(), or however it is, and its big incrementign number, in its method. The method itself isnt that important as most people could find out how to have a random method with those two items.</p>
<p>There is a difference from java 1.5 to java 1.4 though. Java 1.4 uses the System.currentTimeMillis(), so it was suggested to only use 1 Random object at a time to share in all of your classes, it was supposed to be static. This wasnt the best design, and some people complained about Random objects returning the same number ( 1 millisecond is a long time for computers :p), so they changed the System.currentTimeMillis() to System.currentTimeNanos() (which suprised me that it worked because not all operating systems’ clocks are that accurate, windows actually used to increment its time every 8 milliseconds or so).</p>
<p>Im not sure I explained it very well, but both work… a difference in random objects is like a difference in different shoes, they both work, they just look different. In my oppinion though, Random.nextInt() is alot easier than using Math.random(). Math.random() might be a little faster, ill test it out in a minute and repost here…</p>
<p>EDIT: that big number i was talking about is called the seed… still didnt run the program though</p>
<p>EDIT2: Math.random is actually slower:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">import java.util.*;

public class Tester
{
    private Random rand;
    public Tester()
    {
        rand = new Random();
        int[] intz0r = new int[10];
        long time = System.currentTimeMillis();
        testRandom(intz0r, time);
        intz0r = new int[10];
        time = System.currentTimeMillis();
        testMath(intz0r, time);
        
    }
    public void testRandom(int[] intz0r, long time)
    {
        for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10000000; i++)
        {
            intz0r[rand.nextInt(10)]++;
        }
        System.out.println(System.currentTimeMillis() - time);
        print(intz0r);
    }
    public void testMath(int[] intz0r, long time)
    {
        for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10000000; i++)
        {
            intz0r[(int)(Math.random() * 10)]++;
        }
        System.out.println(System.currentTimeMillis() - time);
        print(intz0r);
    }
    public void print(int[] x)
    {
        System.out.print("[");
        for(int a : x)
        {
            System.out.print(a + ", ");
        }
        System.out.println("]");
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>printed these results:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">1642
[1001035, 1000037, 999685, 1000116, 999273, 999536, 1000421, 999994, 999544, 1000359, ]
3935
[1000385, 1000968, 999732, 1001392, 999678, 1000450, 1000096, 999653, 998931, 998715, ]
</code></pre>
<p>that shows both do about the same thing, but the Random class is faster when working with ints</p>
