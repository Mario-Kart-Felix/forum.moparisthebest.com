    <description>So i erased my no-ip address and nulls keep logging on from this ip: 74.115.3.62
WTF IS GOING ON?! Every time i start it they just crash it
I have tried like 14 different sources and NOTHING
Im like so confused
the thing is that ip is kind of close to my ip (except the second digit)
and i have an internet tv and im wondering if something is interfering? i dunno:( please help
im using an allstar base but its a clean base without the glitches
the source has anti null and stuff i really dont get what is going on i really need help:(&#39;
i ALSO ip banned it from the server. did nothing

the person who is nulling the server either has an ip changer program, so it wouldn’t matter if you put him in ip ban or ban text files which means they could be DDosing which is illegal or it could not be someone spamming it could have been from non-properly coded anti-null &amp; is causing this to happen.<br>

Most RSPS block the local IP address, which can be changed.</p>
<p>OT: I suggest adding a check in initialize() checking for the first two number ‘74.115’ and ip ban them.</p>
