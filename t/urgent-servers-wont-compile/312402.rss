    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/urgent-servers-wont-compile/312402</link>
    <description>i was trying to get javac to work, so i set my classpath and shit with the program in downloads section, and now my perfectly compiled server doesnt compile anymore, awhole alot of functions in signlink for client, and shit

It does this with every client, source, any java file

ive reinstalled/system restored, still the same, i downloaded like 14 servers, all the same crap

[b]Fixed it!

I just had to remove the classpath, and now everything works like its suppose to[/b]
