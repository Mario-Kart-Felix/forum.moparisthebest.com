    <title>An awesome idea</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/an-awesome-idea/527268</link>
    <description>If any of you play WoW or used to, you probably know Arenas.

Why isn&#39;t that put in rs private servers yet?
I really think this will make pvp in rsps so much better.

If you are wondering what Arenas are, basically you create a team, then you can create a group if every team member is online. When all the required team members are online you can queue for the mode you would like to play, there are 3 different modes, 2v2, 3v3, 5v5. Once a match is found players of the group will get teleported to a INSTANCED Arena map. (this can be a dungeon or some cool place in rs) You get 1 minute to prepare then the battle starts, you kill each other, if you die you will NOT respawn and NOT lose items, in wow you can be a ghost observe the match. If all team members are killed on one group, they lose, obviously the team who then have people still alive wins. 

If you won your match you would get rating depending on how high you&#39;re rating is, when it is quite high the rating that is added is quite low which makes it so it truly takes skill to get to a high rating.

If you are defeated you will lose rating depending if you&#39;re rating is above 1k i believe. 

When you are high rating you would be able to purchase great gear, for arena points. (now conquest points) Arena points were always given weekly depending on your rating, seeing how that would take too much time it would probably be better to just give arena points on each win. Not too much though :).
