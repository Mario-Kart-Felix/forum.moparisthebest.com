Russian singer Eduard Khil, who became an internet sensation two years ago is now critical in hospital after a stroke.

Russia Today reported that Khil, 77, is in coma with doctors saying chances of full recovery are slim and the singer may end up with irreversible brain damage.

Khil is a Soviet-era legend who became one of the Web&#39;s biggest sensations when an old video of his - singing I Am So Happy to Finally Be Back Home - surfaced on YouTube. Soon named the Trololo man, the video clocked millions of hits and fans even invited him to home countries for tours.

Eduard Khil was born in Smolensk in 1934. His family are currently seeking extra funds for his treatment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
