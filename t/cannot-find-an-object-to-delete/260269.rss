    <description>OK. I am using Allstars source and I cannot find this ice gate anywhere in my server to delete it. It is an ice gate that guards edgeville and it is really annoying. I tried searching coordinates and names and still nothing. Does someone have a fix for this annoyance?</description>

Just delete all the objects on the server, they’re all pretty much junk that allstar put on there. Starting over would give you a better view and start on private servers. That’s just my two cents.<br>

Reaper has a good point i personally deleted every one of them but like 3 for examples and i went through many other places and cleaned it out a bit</p>

            if playerRights &lt;= 2) {
                sendMessage("yo yo you cant to that");
}
}</code><br>
and that should work btw i hand coded that so it might not be entirely right if you know what i mean</p>
<p>and if you get 100 errors chances are you forgot a bracket some where you know about the opening and closing brackets right?[/code]</p>

              <p>ok well what you want is</p>
<p>when a player with rights less than 3 types the command (s)he gets “asdad” message</p>
<p>which is very simple</p>
<p>give me  a sec to wip something up</p>
<p>I suggest separating the god and god off commands<br>
like so</p>
<p>[code]<br>
if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(“god”) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 2) {<br>
setAnimation(1500);<br>
playerSE = 1501;<br>
playerSEW = 1851;<br>
playerSER = 1851;<br>
playerSEA = 1851;<br>
playerEnergy = 99999999;<br>
playerLevel[3] = 99999999;<br>
sendFrame126(playerEnergy + “%”, 149);<br>
sendMessage(“God mode on”);<br>
updateRequired = true;<br>
appearanceUpdateRequired = true;</p>
<pre><code>    if (command.equalsIgnoreCase("godoff") &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 2) {
        sendMessage("god mode off");
        playerSE = 0x328;
        playerSEW = 0x333;
        playerSER = 0x338;
        playerSEA = 0x326;
        playerEnergy = 100;
        playerLevel[3] = getLevelForXP(playerXP[3]);
        sendFrame126(playerEnergy + "%", 149);
        updateRequired = true;
        appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
    }[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>and then add a else statement</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">} else {</code></pre>
<p>and then you message</p>
<p><code>} else {
                sendMessage("yo yo you cant to that");</code><br>
so if your player rights are &gt;= 2 you will get that message</p>
<p>and closing brackets and stuff</p>

<p>When I put this in though their were some errors and I couldn’t figure out how to make it where there wasnt. I tried all the rules by the book.</p>
