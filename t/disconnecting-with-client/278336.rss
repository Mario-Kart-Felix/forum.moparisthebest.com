    <title>Disconnecting With Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/disconnecting-with-client/278336</link>
    <description>Ok, Well I&#39;ve download a Server Source with their Client. I&#39;ve started to edit a few things such as changing the old Server Name.
After I did that, I compiled and restarted the server. I then tryed connecting with the Client, and
whenever I connect, right when it gets in, it disconnects. I look in my Server Console, and It has no errors or anything.
It just says (Playername) has logged in, and then (Playername) has disconnected..
Anyone knows what could be the problem?</description>
