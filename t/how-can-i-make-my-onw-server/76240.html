        <p>Purpose: This is a simple tutorial that will explain how to edit a private server. Here are the chapters we will cover in this ultimate server guide:</p>
<p>Difficulty: 2</p>
<p>Assumed Knowledge: Know what a router is. Know what a computer is. Know what the internet is. Know how to read. Know what an IP address is. Know the difference between an internet IP address and a computer/gateway IP address. Know how to use a keyboard (possibly, not entirely required), and finally you need to know how to click with a mouse.</p>
<p>Server Base: I have not personally performed this tutorial, but it is compatible with ANY server source.</p>
<p>Classes Modified: Possibly client.java, item.java, item2.java, npchandler.java, shophandler.java, playerhandler.java, and server.java.</p>
<p>chapter 1 ~ Getting a server source and setting up your server for running to the public and editing.</p>
<p>chapter 2 ~ Thoroughly explaining the important .cfg files.</p>
<p>chapter 3 ~ Explaining variables, frames, and interfaces are and what they do in the .java 's.</p>
<p>chapter 4 ~ Explaining how to edit your .java 's and the purpose of each individual one.</p>
<p>chapter 5 ~ How to learn more and help other players/make your own tutorials!</p>
<p>chapter 6 ~ Setting up a no-ip for your server!</p>
<p>chapter 7 ~ Making a fourms and Website for your server as well as a pumping name!</p>
<hr>
<p>CHAPTER 1:</p>
<p>First off we need a server source (Testscape personally recommended):</p>
<p>Moparscape Server Downloads</p>
<p>All of the top server sources + fast downloading</p>
<p>We may also need Moparscape v3.2:</p>
<p>Moparscape v3.2 w/ Aryan</p>
<p>Next, you will need to open ports in Windows Firewall and/or the firewalls offered by McAffee, Norton, or other full-system maintenance suites.  For Windows Firewall, open its settings file in the control panel.  Click on the “Exceptions Tab” and then click “Add Port.”  Add the following port: 43594.  (If you’d rather not open a specific port or have to worry about Windows Firewall disabling access in any way, you can disable it entirely.)</p>
<p>Now we will need to make the rule for your router, by doing this you need to go into your router. You can do this by going into Internet Explorer (or whatever client you use for the Internet), and then type in the IP address of the router. Now log into the router and go into “advanced” (at top of screen on mine). Then on the sidebar to the left click the “gaming” button (is only left side for me…) Then you need to make a new rule and fill in the blanks with this information:</p>
<p>Name: 1<br>
IP address: 2<br>
TCP Ports to open: 43594<br>
UDP Ports to open:<br>
Inbound Filter: Allow All<br>
Schedule: Always</p>
<p>KEY<br>
1 = Any name you want the server to be (I.E.MyScape).[/glow]<br>
2 = The IP adddress of your COMPUTER; not the Internet.<br>
Then save it. Ok now you can save settings after the rule is saved. Every router is different.  Check with the manuals for yours to fully understand how to open the ports. If you cannot find/have a manuel, go to this address:</p>
<p>Port Forwarding</p>
<p>Now your server rule is nice and good. Now we need Java to get your server’s compiler and runserver to work. You can download the newest java at this link:</p>
<p>Java SE Downloads Page</p>
<p>Now, click JDK 6.0</p>
<p>Click yes to it. Now you want to agree to the terms and conditions:<br>
You will now get another security box (shown above), just click yes to that again. Now, download the Windows Offline Installation for Multiple Languages (if you are not using Windows, then try downloading the offline installations for some other Operating Systems):</p>
<p>Now the download window will come up. Just click Run and wait for it to end downloading. Then install it and everything should work.</p>
<p>Ok before we can fix the compiler and runeserver, we need to set out variables. Ok go into start menu, then control panel, then system, then advanced, then enviromental variables.</p>
<p>start menu -&gt; control panel -&gt; system -&gt; advanced -&gt; enviromental variables</p>
<p>Ok now find the variable called “path” in the list in that new screen open. Rename it to “PATH” and then for it’s variable value (erase old one):<br>
C:Windows\System32;“C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0\bin”</p>
<p>You will also need to set a variables called “classpath”. Make a new variable and give it the name classpath. No add this in for it’s value:<br>
“C:\Program Files\Java\Java\jdk1.6.0\bin”</p>
<p>Ok now go into your server source (if you dont have a rar uncompressor you can download 7zip at this link: 7zip, or you can download rar uncompresser at this link: WinRar. Ok now you can right click the compressed source and click “extract here”),<br>
and now when in your server srouce, right click compile.bat and click “edit”. Then erase everything in it and put this in it’s place:</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/echo.html">@echo</a> off<br>
title Compiler<br>
“%ProgramFiles%\Java\jdk1.6.0\bin\javac.exe” -cp . *.java<br>
pause</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/echo.html">@echo</a> off<br>
title Runserver<br>
set java=“C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0\bin\java.exe”<br>
java -Xmx1024m -cp .;./jython.jar;./MySql/mysql-connector-java-3.0.17-ga-bin.jar server<br>
pause</p>
<p>Ok now we have a working source!</p>
<hr>
<p>CHAPTER 2:</p>
<p>Ok now we want to edit your cfg files. Ok first of right click your cfg files and click “open with”, then search the list for notepad. High-light it and then click the box at the bottom of that window that says “use this to open all files of this type” (make sure it has a check mark in it), then click ok. Do this same thing with the .java 's. Ok now open up autospawn.cfg. This is the first few lines of my autospawn:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
//------NpcID—CoordX–CoordY–Height–RangeX1-RangeY1-RangeX2-RangeY2-WalkType-Descrption<br>
spawn = 1699	2816	3462	0	2817	3463	2815	3461	2	Ghost Shopkeeper<br>
spawn = 23	2660	3304	0	2662	3306	2658	3302	2	Knight Of Adrougne<br>
spawn = 23	2662	3309	0	2665	3311	2660	3308	2	Knight Of Adrougne</p>
<p>Ok the first is a Ghost Shopkeeper (hence the description). The “spawn = 1699” is saying that npc 1699 (1699 = code of that npc) will be spawned (we will get into other npc codes in the furture). Now the “2816” and “3462” are the X and Y cordinates of where the npc will be spawned on the map. This is just like Math in school, the X and Y are just like X and Y on a graph. You can find you X and Y cords inside the game by using the command ::mypos or by looking in the player settings button on the sidebar and your X and Y cords are usually next to your run energy. Ok now the “0” above is the height of the npc. Unless you are making in a multi-level house/building or are in a dungeon, keep this at 0 when making your own npc spawns. Now the “2817”, “3463”, “2815”, and “3461” are the X X and Y Y cords of where the npc will be walking. This can get confusing (lol) so you can just keep these at 0 0 0 0 if you wish. Then next thing is “2”. This represents the walk-type of the npc. You can keep this at 1 if you are making the npc stationary. Now the last thing is the “Ghost Shopkeeper”. This is the title and you need one. It can be anything you want but I would advise to put the npc name here, then click enter to the next line, and then put the city/place where it is being spawned. This will save a lot of confusion.</p>
<p>Ok now lets look at npc.cfg. Here is another few lines of code from mine:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
//Fixed by: Takajin++ a.k.a. Yetsuki<br>
//    NpcID     NpcName                         combat  health<br>
npc = 0		Hans				0	0<br>
npc = 1		Man				2	7<br>
npc = 2		Man				2	7<br>
npc = 3		Man				2	7<br>
npc = 4		Woman				2	7<br>
npc = 5		Woman				2	7<br>
npc = 6		Woman</p>
<p>Ok the first thing “npc = 0” is the ID code for that npc (this ID code is what is used for autospawn.cfg and npc-spawning commands in-game). Then the “Hans” is the name of the npc (pretty much it’s here for fast maneuvering through wanted npcs.) The “0” after the name is the comabt level of the npc (you can change this but it won’t do anything. I think it is just a reminder so you dont have to look in-game for the npc’s combat level.) Now the next number “0” in this case is the npc’s health. If you want to spawn attackable npcs then you have to make sure they have hit-points; otherwise, the game will freeze upon seeing the npc (I.E. Kalphite Queen).</p>
<p>Here we will now go through item.cfg. Here are some lines of mine:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
//-----ShopID—ShopName---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
item = 1	Tool_kit	These_could_be_handy.	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0<br>
item = 2	Cannonball	Ammo_for_the_Dwarf_Cannon.	4.67264229473597	4.67264229473597	4.85427038587765	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0<br>
item = 3	Nulodion’s_notes	Construction_notes_for_Dwarf_cannon_ammo.	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0</p>
<p>Ok this is similarly to npc.cfg. The “item = 1” says that the “Tool_kit” 's ID is 1. “Tool_kit” is the name of the Item. (all spaces in the the description and name for a regulart item would be turned into a _ [I.E. “abyssal whip” would be “abyssal_whip”].) The “These_could_be_handy.” is the description of the item (no use of changing this). The “1”, “1”, and “1” are the values of the item. CHANGE THE SECOND NUMBER IN THIS SET OF 3 NUMBERS FOR ABSOULUTLY CHANGE THE OVERALL PRIZE OF THE ITEM. The next 12 numbers are the bonuses that you get when wearing/wielding this item (of course this is only for items that you can wear/wield).</p>
<p>Now we will be going through shops.cfg. Here is some lines from me, once again:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
//-----ShopID—ShopName----------------------------------------Sell----Buy-----Item----Amount–Item----Amount–Item----Amount–Item----Amount–Item----Amount–Item----Amount–Item----Amount–Item----Amount–Item----Amount–Item----Amount–Item----Amount–Item----Amount–Item----Amount–Item----Amount–Item----Amount–Item----Amount–Item----Amount–Item----Amount<br>
shop = 1	Varrock_General_Store				1	1	1931	5	1935	2	1735	2	1925	3	1923	2	1887	2	590	2	1755	2	2347	5	550	5	2552	20<br>
shop = 2	Aubury’s_Rune_Store				2	2	554	50000	555	50000	556	50000	557	50000	558	50000	559	50000	562	5000	560	25000	4278	25000	563	25000</p>
<p>Ok the “shop = 1” designates this shop as shop 1 (will learn more about this when we get to shophandler.java). Now the “Varrock_General_Store” is the name that will show up while seeing this shop in-game (always use underscores for spaces for names!) If you want it to show up colors, here are some nifty color symbols you put IN FRONT OF the name:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
<span class="mention">@gre</span>@<br>
<a class="mention" href="../../u/red.html">@red</a>@<br>
<span class="mention">@yel</span>@<br>
<a class="mention" href="../../u/cya.html">@cya</a>@<br>
<span class="mention">@whi</span>@<br>
<span class="mention">@bla</span>@<br>
<a class="mention" href="../../u/pur.html">@pur</a>@<br>

Now the “1” “1” after the name designates the shop type. (“1” “1” is a general store type - you can sell any item to it. “2” “2” is a special store type - you can only sell back what it already has in stock.) Now the “1931” is the item type that you want in the first slot on that store. You can put any itm you want here. The “5” after the “1931” is the amount of that item you want sold at once/at beginning of server startup. ALWAYS PUT A TAB BETWEEN THE SHOP ID AND THE NAME, ALWAYS PUT A TAB BETWEEN SHOP NAME AND SHOP TYPE, ALWAYS PUT A TAB BETWEEN SHOP TYPE AND SHOP ITEMS, ALWAYS PUT A TAB BETWEEN ITEM SOLD IN SHOP AND ITS AMOUNT, and ALWAYS PUT A TAB BETWEEN THE PREVIOUS ITEM AMOUNT AND THE ITEM SOLD IN THE NEXT SLOT AFTER IT.</p>

        <p>CHAPTER 3:</p>
<p>Ok in this chapter we will be explaining different variables, frames, cases, and interfaces inside the different java files. I will also explain what they are used for. By knowing this you will become a much better coder. First off we will tackle the different variables.</p>
<p>Ok there are several commonly-used variables:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
boolean<br>
void<br>
int</p>
<p>There are about 20 other ones in java besides these that are used, but these are the main ones used in RS2 private servers and probably the only ones you will be editing (for now.) Ok the boolean variable is usually used for large actions that include smaller variables inside them (voids and ints.) So here is an example of a boolean:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
public boolean process()<br>
{		// is being called regularily every 500ms<br>
NewObjects();<br>
writePlayers();<br>
This boolean is being used as a public boolean (which means it can be accessed by all other java files; you can also make it a private or just keep it boolean to make only that java file use it) and smaller-used variables inside it are “NewObjects();” and “writePlayers();”. Ok so now you understand booleans.<br>
Lets move onto voids. Here is an example of a public void:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
public void Shinykey()<br>
{<br>
sendMessage(“Your key shines up the room as the chest opens.”);<br>
deleteItem(85,getItemSlot(85),1);<br>
addItem(1607,1);<br>
addItem(Item2.randomshinykey(), 1);<br>
}<br>
Ok the void name is “Shinykey()” and it is invlolving code to send a message to the player, to delete the item (in this case the shinykey) and to add an item to the players inventory. But anyways, now this can be used for an action like in this sequence:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
//shiny key<br>
else if(useItemID == 85 &amp;&amp; (atObjectID == 172))//crystal chest<br>
{<br>
Shinykey();<br>
}<br>
This is saying that if the item (85) is being used at the object (172) then it will use the public void “Shinykey()”. Make sense? Good.<br>
Ok now moving to int (intigers.) Ok this is a good exaomple of an int:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
public static int shinykey[] = {1046,4566,5698,1623,4566,4566,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623};//chest of keys - shiny key</p>
<pre><code>public static int randomshinykey()
{
	return shinykey[(int)(Math.random()*shinykey.length)];
}
</code></pre>
<p>Ok this is giving a public static int (the static is allowing it to be used in a public void [look above at my shinykey void]) the matrix of all those item IDs. Now the next public static int makes a random of that matrix to be picked when being used in a void. In this sequence - “shinykey()”.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let’s move onto Frames now. Here are a few examples of Frames, sendQuests, and sendMessages being used:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
sendQuest("<span class="mention">@gre</span>@Welcome to Freescape", 8145);<br>
Code:<br>
sendMessage(“Oh dear you are dead!”);<br>
Code:<br>
sendFrame126(“TzHaar”, 2484);<br>
Ok the first one “showQuest” is tell to show “Welcome to Freescape” on an interface (in this case the interface is inside the void MainHelpMenu.) The “8145” is the programmed frame of where the “showQuest” will show up in the Interface. Now the “sendMessage” is easy. When you die (in this sequence), then it will send a message in the chat box saying “Oh dear you are dead!”. This is simple enough. Now we will move onto the frame one. “sendFrame126” is saying that in that case (case 75 in this sequence) is sending frame126 to the amulet of glory saying in a frame “TzHaar”. This is as simple as it can get, sorry. I hope you understand the different purposes of this section of chapter 3.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now the tough one - cases! First off, cases are used to set certain actions to specific items/interfaces/frames. here is an example of a case being used:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
case 24: //KEY CRAFTING MADE 100% BY MOD TAHAROK<br>
sendFrame164(4882);<br>
stillgfx(199, absX, absY);<br>
sendFrame126(“Congratulations, you just advanced a Key Crafting level!”, 4884);<br>
sendFrame126(“Congratulations, your Key Crafting is now “+playerLevel[24]+” .”, 4885);<br>
sendMessage(“Congratulations, you just advanced a Key Crafting level!”);<br>
NpcDialogueSend = true;<br>
break;<br>
Now this is saying that “case 24” is setting my skill (lol.) This is setting “sendFrame126” 's to send a frame with those messages when I level up a new level. Also it will send a message to me (“sendMessage”.) This also allows “NpcDialogue” 's to be used with this case. Besides that you can tell this case designates keycrafting a skill.</p>
<hr>
<p>Ok now we will move onto Interfaces. Interfaces are skins used to cover everything up that we usually use. Like menu backrounds (just the backround) are interfaces. Then the sidebar backround is the exact same Interface on each different tab. Here is an example of an Interface:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
clearQuestInterface();<br>
Code:<br>
showInterface(8134);<br>
Ok now this is saying to clear all quest interfaces (type of interface.) But it also says to “showInterface(8134)”. Interface 8134 is the backround on menus. This is putting in the menu-backround-Interface after the “sendQuest” 's that I put into a void (MainHelpMenu). This is fairly easy to understand. I hope you enjoyed chapter 3 - I certainly did!</p>

<p>CHAPTER 4:</p>
<p>Ok first off is the client.java. The purpose of this is to put together all of the skins and models together into code for the<br>
java compiler to compile. It is pretty much the main source file (but not the full thing; only about 35% of the source.) It is<br>
fairly easy to edit it. When someone says “declare” scomthing, then you need to put it with the rest of that type (I.E. someone<br>
wants you t declare “public void hi()”, then you would search “public void” until you see public voids whose code is similar to<br>
the one your supposed to add. Now just add it with one of those and your done.) If you want to fully save settings, then you save<br>
the file and then click “compile.bat” to compile the .class file. I pretty much summed everything up. Also, if someone doesnt say<br>
declare but does not show or say where to put it, then declare it yourself (and when you are declaring a case, then put it after<br>
the case bfore it [I.E. case 24 would be declared after case 23].)</p>
<p>Next is Item.java. This folder is very important because it has a few booleans in it that help code the public static int 's used<br>
in the other Item javas (item2.java &amp; item3.java.) It also holds the code for defining the collision types of each different item<br>
name (hat, shield, weapon ect.) The final thing it does is program the client.java and server.java to run with item.cfg.<br>
Now we will go through the item2.java. This file is used to make public static int 's and build large matricies of numbers in<br>
them. This file is mainly used for various public voids, but mainly for npc drops. This goes the same with Item3.java.<br>
Next on the list is npchandler.java. This file is used to make npcs be able to speak above their heads, but this is only one small<br>
thing that this file is used for. But this is probably one of the most important files in the entire server. It runs all of the<br>
autospawn 's (cfg files), and the npc.cfg and npcdrops.cfg files. It also has the code for being able to attack a npc, and to kill<br>
it. This is a VERY IMPORTANT file for you monster-killer lovers!<br>
P.S. Here is code for making a npc speak above their head:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
if (npcs[i].npcType == 2633)<br>
{<br>
if (misc.random(20) == 1)<br>
{<br>
npcs[i].textUpdate = “Owner Mod Taharok likes his tea!”;<br>
}<br>
}<br>
Ok now we will talk about shophandler.java. This file pretty much controls shops.cfg and thats important to all shopers. That is<br>
about all this file does…<br>
We are almost there for chapter 4! Now we will talk about playerhandler,.java. This file is the one that controls about 4<br>
different folders. It also controls the IP address of whoever logs on. This is also where we can add an auto-saver for auto-saving<br>
and to make this file much more useful.<br>
Final file to talk about - server.java. This file is of course the most important file. This file redirects the compiler to<br>
compile all of the .java files that it normally wouldn’t. This file also runs the log-on “team” and log-off “team”. It is also the<br>
file which you can port forward the TCP port in the server (have to change in router if change ehre too), 43594. This file and the<br>
compiler.bat would together be the “make file” in a C++ progam source.</p>
<hr>
<p>CHAPTER 5:</p>
<p>This chapter should be pretty self-explanitory. Helping players would be like to re-directing them to this guide or to help them<br>
on the help that they need. This cannot only benefit them, but also benefit you. Making your own tutorials is pretty simple. First<br>
off you just go to the semi-upper-right-hand-corner of the tutorials section on the website. Now you click the button “New Topic”<br>
and then put a subject in.<br>
Making a tutorial in general is pretty simple. There is a button on the top when ur in you message-editing screen that looks liek<br>
this: # . Now this button is used for making code bars (appears as<br>
Code:<br>
/inside message but turns out boxes once posted.)<br>
So you understand that. By using the toolbar at the top you will be able to figure out how to make the ultimate tutorial! (in<br>
appearance.) So that sums up chapter 5!</p>
<hr>
<p>CHAPTER 6</p>
<p>Ok this is fairly simple how to set up a no-ip for your server. Go to no-ip:</p>
<p>No-ip</p>
<p>First of all, log in:</p>
<p>As you can see, add in the name you need. Now choose the redirect address. After that, add in your external IP address with is shown at the upper left-hand side of the screen. When you are done with that, click the ‘Create Host’ button. If you are port forwarded (if you have a router), then this should work. Enjoy!</p>
<hr>
<p>CHAPTER 7</p>
<p>Ok I will be explaining how to set up a good website and a good fourms page as well as an awesome name for your source. This chapter mainly bases upon making smart choices with your server so it catches the modern person’s eye.</p>
<p>First of all we will cover those smart decisions. First off we need a good source! There are many good sources out there and I advise to take a source that is somewhat edited by someone else and that is based off of a great original source. I hear that a good source is Pimpscape, and I personal favorite is Project 16 version 6 edit 8. I have not used P16 in a long time but it is the least bugged source available. Ok now we need a good and easy name to remember/type. First of all think up an awesome name that has not been used before (or is very scarce.) Then you can add some 1337 to it or chane caps when on server page. I think we can do names like these:</p>
<p>taharokscape</p>
<p>1337mopar1337</p>
<p>1337mod1337</p>
<p>0wn@g3sc@p3</p>
<p>These are just a few examples. Your names reflects what “you-see” in a private server. Now we need those updates that will catch the person’s eyes. First off I would advise to edit theiving and add stalls and more npcs with great rewards. PKING OF COURSE!!! We need runecraftin in there and special smithing. I would suggest adding in Barrows as well. If I release my tutorials again, try adding in the Key mini-games. You could make your own skills that thrills people (use my guide to making skills  ). Food shops and if your that person that wants everyone to be lazy, add commands as well. I hope this helped you with starting-up a server =)</p>
<p>Now I will discuss how to build a good website and forums page for your website. I do not know much about the smf forums and I like freewebs, so I will be using Freewebs and InvisionFree. Ok first off go to <a href="http://freewebs.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Freewebs.com</a> and click the big “Sign Up” button. Chooe your username (remember your username will be your site address!) and fill out the other blanks. Now pick your template for your website. Pick site title and categories (up to 3.)<br>
Now click the “Sit manager”. You can use the buttons specified (add a new link/add a new page) to do those tasks. If you wish to view your site during the managing, you can click the “view my site” in the upper-right-hand-corner of the site. If you want to edit a page, click on the link and “add a new paragraph” and a useful text box will pop up (click done in upper right hand corner to finish it.) Now you can make a new page called “forums”  and insert your forums address (if you do not have a fourms, look below and add one and then insert the link to it.) If you want people to go to your website, then go to this addres:</p>
<p><a href="http://freewebs.com/YOURUSERNAMEHERE/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">freewebs.com/YOURUSERNAMEHERE/</a></p>
<p>Ok now we will talk about InvisionFree. Go to the main page &lt; and click the “Register” button which is on the left of the page. Fill out the blanks and questions (keep it close to your Freewebs and close to your Server.) A page will come up with the link to your fourms, THAT IS THE LINK FOREVER UNLESS YOU BUY PREMIUM. Now, once on your forums, click on the Admin CP link at the top. Log in with the SAME USERNAME AND PASSWORD that you made on InvisionFree. Now this may look detailed and difficult, but I will go thoroughly in-detail about making websites and InvisionFree. If you cannot wait until I release it, you can talk on the InvisionFree fourms and talk about tutorials about making your server awesome (there is links in the Admin CP for the fourms.) Happy fourms/website/server building and Enjoy!</p>
