              <p>The IP has no belonging in your server. Also, is your IP dymanic (assigned to your computer, and that is all your computer uses), or is it static (gets a new one every connect). It needs to be assigned to our computer via router. If its not, that could just be your problem.</p>
<p>Also, about the “server already in use”, go to your task-manager and exit javaw.exe and/or java.exe</p>
