    <description>Well.... My stupidest I would have to say....

I got real smashed and got home at like 1am... and my mom came down in the basement about 10 mins later, so I tried to look occupied, by reading Harry Potter...

I was reading the book upside down and outloud.... I was like 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Ha... Ha.... Har... Harry-Poooter&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I got grounded for 2 weeks lol, cause my mom was like &quot;what the hell?&quot; and smelled my breath.</description>

Everyone in my family buys for me, even my parents but they won’t buy me a shitload. They will buy me something like a 6 pack and at the most a two four.</p>

<p>Whats so weird about that? Me and my friends used to get drunk at 12 all the time. It just depends where you live/the school you go to. It might not be the norm where you are, but it’s normal plenty of places. Drinking in your young teen years can be good anyways, helps you be more responsible for it later on.[/quote]<br>

A 13 year old drunk?[/quote]</p>
<p>Whats so weird about that? Me and my friends used to get drunk at 12 all the time. It just depends where you live/the school you go to. It might not be the norm where you are, but it’s normal plenty of places. Drinking in your young teen years can be good anyways, helps you be more responsible for it later on.</p>
