    <title>Ignore Special Attack Timer?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ignore-special-attack-timer/225867</link>
    <description>Hi! I want to add Granite Maul special to my server (Just like real RS) I got the emotes, GFX...etc done! But When I went to test it out a click on the special attack bar a few times hoping that it will double/triple hit.. But it doesnt.. It appears that it has like a timer.. Because once I click I have to wait about one second for it to attack... Is there a way to remove the special attack timer so that when I &#39;spam&#39; the special attack bar it double/triple hits my opponnent?</description>
