    <description>RsResources Official Aryan Scripting Tutorial

Level: Beginner

[size=10pt][u][b]Tutorial 1:[/b][/u][/size]

 

Well welcome to the 1st actual tutorial of Aryan scripting im going to show you the basics and next tutorial we will start on a power fisher which will be built on during the beginners section of tutorials. So ill now show you the basics you need for a script.
Script
[code]
public class ScriptName extends Script
{

/* Base of a script */
public static String[] commands = {&quot;run_command&quot;};

public boolean start(String cmd, String[] args)
{

return true;

}

public long run(long lastExecuted)

// lets start running yay
{

return 0;

}
}
[/code]
That above is very messy and I apologise for it. Itâ€™s the whole table thing grrr. Honestly!

Anyways copy and compile that oh and save it as ScriptName.java and in the drop down menu, all files. This makes it a java file and not a plain old text file. Also Compiling basically turns a human readable language into a computer readable language which is binary code.

Well letâ€™s explain what each line does,
[code]/* Base of a script */
// lets start running yay[/code]

These are comments. Comments are ignored by the compiler and are not included in the actual program. So what are they for?

When youâ€™re making a program or script, you will know exactly where everything is, hell you put it there, but when someone comes along and looks at it they may not be able to tell straight away where things are or what this is for etc. So you can use comments to help them out a bit. Also say you just want to leave a note to someone looking at the script you can use them as well for example you may want to say to someone.
[tt]//DONT CHANGE THIS[/tt]

Because it could be used for the script to function properly.

Below are a few more examples and have nothing to do with Aryan. Donâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t understand anything up now.

[code]// This is put after script lines
int 2006; // this is the year

/*

this is put if you want to make a whole paragraph of comments
like a readme at the begginging of a script or something.

*/[/code]

 
[code]public class ScriptName extends Script[/code]

This is declaring the class file and also that the class file extends &quot;Script&quot;, because it extends &quot;Script&quot;, your class has access to all the data and methods in the class &quot;Script&quot;. You have called this file &quot;ScriptName&quot; and therefore it must be saved as &quot;ScriptName.java&quot; otherwise you will get an error about being named wrong. Change the name to whatever you like. For example if youâ€™re making a powerMiner you may want to call it PowerMiner. So your first line will be.
public class PowerMiner extends Script

 
[code]public static String[] commands = {&quot;run_command&quot;};[/code]

This is where you declare what your run command will be. So letâ€™s see. Well use the powerMining example again. If your making a power miner you may like to use the run command &quot;MineOre&quot; , the command must be entirely unique , I mean what will happen if 2 script have the same run command ?

[code]public boolean start(String cmd, String[] args)
{

return true;

}
[/code]
This returns true:
False = dont start script
True = Start script

So you may want to add a check in there. Something like

[code]if(inventoryCount(PickAxe) &lt; 1)
{
return false;

}[/code]

InventoryCount (PickAxe): This is obvious; itâ€™s seeing how many pickaxes you have.
&lt; 1: This means smaller then one
return false : Do not start script

 
[code]if(inventoryCount(PickAxe) &lt; 1)[/code]

This whole statement means. If pickaxe count is less then one donâ€™t start script. Basically if you donâ€™t have a pickaxe. You would need to declare what PickAxe is because at the moment there just words and the computer donâ€™t know what they are.

To get what a pickaxe actually is you need to go onto Aryan, right click a pickaxe and you will see itâ€™s Id. Then youâ€™d need to declare the id and assign it to pickaxe.
[code]int PickAxe = 123;[/code]

Int means integer which basically means number. Char is for character and String is for a String of text, but to be honest just concentrates on int right now. The pickaxe id is a number and therefore we use int.

Now the script knows what itâ€™s counting. Itâ€™s counting the item in your inventory with the id 123. Simple.

[code]public long run(long lastExecuted)
{

return 0;

}[/code]

This is where you have your script run. Most scripts use an execution of methods (ill explain that later). Thereâ€™s a few that just put the code straight in like this.

[code]public long run(long lastExecuted)
{

log(&quot;Hello);
log(&quot;this script is running weeeee&quot;);

return 0;

}[/code]

 

log prints the message inside the brackets and quotes to the Black Aryan screen. Also known as the ms-dos screen.

Well that concludes the first tutorial.

In the next one well have a bit more fun. This one has been nothing but reading so ill be surprised if you havenâ€™t fallen asleep by now. If you donâ€™t understand it donâ€™t worry! Still try the next tutorial, because the next is when you will be doing the coding.

[u][b]TUTORIAL 2[/b][/u][/size]
RsResources Offical Aryan Scripting Tutorial

Level : Beginners

Tutorial 2 :

In this tutorial donâ€™t take everything literally as it is. Most of it is an example and wont work. However I can guarantee the end result will work (after the beginners set of tutorials are done) and all the examples will come together and you will understand at the end of this tutorial.

So we have covered the basics of what is needed in an Aryan scripting tutorial in order to be run.

Also see this for another example (scroll down the page to the code and read through it)

Now is enough of the reading. Now its time to start coding.

Please again let me stress if you do not understand donâ€™t worry im sure youâ€™ll pick it up later or if your getting agitated watch the www.seangreasley.com video java tutorials , look for a tutorial on www.java.sun.com or get your butt out and buy a java book.

In this tutorial I am not going to write out a power fisher and explain it in each bit. I am going to go through it with you, and you will have to do the work (Arenâ€™t I nice?).

So firsts things first you need to know what fish you want your script to fish. I am going to be using shrimp as an example but you can use what you like. You will also need the id of the fish, id of the fishing spot and the id of your fishing net. To do this get on Aryan and find a shrimp fishing spot. Right click the spot and youâ€™ll have an id in the menu. Look at the picture below.

[img]http://www.rs-resources.com/IdUsageExample.JPG[/img]

This is how you obtain id`s for everything in Aryan. There are other ways to get id`s which can be useful in bot making but just use this one for now.

Declare the id youâ€™ve gotten from Aryan. For example you might do this.
[code]
public static final int FishingNet = 303; // id of fishing net
public static final int FishingSpot = 327; // id of fishing spot
public static final int[] Shrimp = 317; // id of shrimp[/code]

(Because itâ€™s final int it means it cannot be changed and you cannot reassign its value later in the script. I mean why would you need to? The shrimp id isnâ€™t going to change and neither is your net value)

You should declare it at the topic of your script because these need to be global. Globally declared variables can be accessed anywhere in the class. If you have an if statement likes this
[code]if (inventoryCount() != 27 ){
int Shrimp;
Shrimp = 317;
atNPC(FishingSpot, &quot;Net&quot;);
}
[/code]

The variables Shrimp can only be used in that statement, it can only be accessed in that one if statement.

If later in your script you wanted to make another if statement likes this.
[code]if (inventoryCount() = = 27 ){
Drop(Shrimp);
}
[/code]
You wouldnâ€™t be able to do it because Shrimp wouldnâ€™t be declared (having Shrimp not being declared globally). Therefore if you declared something globally so everything can access it, and that is a major advantage.

Now Iâ€™ve just bombarded you with a lot of code which may all be new to you. So let me explain it.

!= means does not equal
[code]if (inventoryCount() != 27 )
[/code]
This means if your inventory count doesnâ€™t equal 27 do the next part, and the next part in the example I gave you is.
[code]int FishingSpot;
FishingSpot = 327;
atNPC(FishingSpot, &quot;Net&quot;);[/code]

so
[code]int Shrimp;[/code]

declaring shrimp
[code]Shrimp = 327;[/code]

saying what value shrimp has.
atNPC(FishingSpot, &quot;Net&quot;);

Actually fishing. An npc is a monster, basically, so more examples of npcs are Rats, Goblins, and Black Knights all stuff like that.

AtNpc is doing something at the npc

There then are 2 parameters you must use. If you look on www.wasteofmoney.org it says something like (I couldnâ€™t check completely because at the time of writing this wasteofmoney.org java docs was down)
atNPC(int type , String index );

The type is the type of fish that your fishing, it takes the type as a number so there you can use FishingSpot because we have already declared that as a number.

Strings can hold text just as intâ€™s can hold numbers an example of a String is
&quot;Net&quot; , &quot;Hello there&quot; , &quot;go away&quot; , &quot; rs-resources.com&quot;


Strings must always be enclosed in quotes &quot;LIKE THIS&quot;
[code]atNPC(FishingSpot, &quot;Net&quot;);[/code]

So this is doing the index &quot;Net&quot; at the id FishingSpot(327). In not so many words net shrimp.

also
[code]atNPC(int type , int index );[/code]

If you look on Aryan. When you right click an npc youâ€™ll see there is a menu. This is roughly what it is when you right click a shrimp.
[code]Net Shrimp
Examine Shrimp[/code]

To fish a shrimp using int index you would do
atNPC(FishingSpot, 0 );

That would be using the int index and not string index. In most things counting starts at 1. ( 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) donâ€™t ask why but in most things in java it starts at 0. Arrays in java start at 0 for example.
[code]Net Shrimp // this index is 0
Examine Shrimp // this index is 1[/code]

so you would want to net a fish and its index is 0 ( because its the first one) hence you would use
atNPC(FishingSpot, 0 );

SO the whole statement means
[code]if (inventoryCount() != 27 ){
int FishingSpot;
Shrimp = 327;
atNPC(FishingSpot, &quot;Net&quot;);
}
[/code]
If you have less then 27 items. Do some fishing. Now the next statement i showed you.
[code]if (inventoryCount() = = 27 ){
Drop(Shrimp);
}[/code]

This means if you have 27 items in your inventory ( if inventoryCount equals 27 ) drop shrimp. In if statements you must use two equal signs ( like this &quot;= =&quot; ) because you are checking if something equals something you are not giving it a new value.
[code]Shrimp = 106;[/code]

That is giving shrimp a new value, and so you use one equal sign.

So the whole main point of that was to firstly show you why you must declare certain variables globally, and the reason basically is because it makes life a lot easier since you will be using the variable quite a lot.

So youâ€™re going to need a fishing method in your script. Something thing that will actually fish. You donâ€™t need to fish when you have a full inventory; you need to fish when your inventory is less then 27. This is where the &gt; and &lt; operators comes in.

[code]10 &gt; 1[/code]

That means 10 is bigger then one.

[code]200 &lt; 1000[/code]

That means 200 is smaller then 1000.

So whatâ€™s the point of them, how can they be used? Ill show you, look at this If statement.
[code]if (inventoryCount() &lt; 27 ){
atNPC(FishingSpot, &quot;Net&quot;);
}[/code]

Now you dont need to declare shrimp because that should have already been declared globaly, so that means if you have less then 27 items in your inventory. Fish .

Now you can make a method for that and call it Fish.
[code]
private long runFish()
{

if (inventoryCount() &lt; 27 )
{
atNPC(FishingSpot, &quot;Net&quot;);
}
}[/code]

There go that is a method. But how do you execute it in your script ?
[code]runFish();[/code]

Is how you would use it?

So whenever you want your script to fish. You use it by typing Fish ();

Thatâ€™s the whole concept of it but thereâ€™s one more problem we have to face
[code]atNpc(int type , String index);[/code]

the fishing spot must be declared
public NPC FishingSpot;

But you cannot do
[code]public NPC FishingSpot = 327;[/code]

Simply because it doesnâ€™t allow you to and if you compile you will receive errors. So to get over this you can do

public NPC fishingNPC;
[code]fishingNPC = findNPCByType(fishingSpot);[/code]

and thats how you get over that problem. Hehe

Returns

If you return a -1 that stops the script

If you return a positive value, it will pause for that many milliseconds and then go back over the run method from the beginning. I.e. if you return
[code]Return 1000;[/code]
Itâ€™ll wait for 1 second.
If you return a method, it basically returns the method
Returns must be put at the end of a method.

Thatâ€™s basically the end of this tutorial and im going to put everything together at the bottom now for you so you should be able to see, what you should have now.
[code]
public class PFisher extends Script
{

public static String[] commands = {&quot;PFish&quot;}; // choose what command you want . Ive chosen PFish for power fish
/* Ive Globely Decalred Varibles here */
public static final int FishingNet = 303; // id of fishing net
public static final int FishingSpot = 327; // id of fishing spot
public static final int Shrimp = 317; // id of shrimp
public NPC fishingNPC;

�

public boolean start(String cmd, String[] args)
{

return true; // later we will put in a check here to check if we have a fishing net and if we dont , dont fish
// if we do , fish

}

public long run(long lastExecuted)
{

return runFish(); // excecute runFish Method

}// end of run command

// begining of Methods

// Start of runFish method.
private long runFish()
{
if (inventoryCount() &lt; 27 )
{
fishingNPC = findNPCByType(FishingSpot); // say what fishingNPC equals
atNPC(fishingNPC, &quot;Net&quot;); // at fishing spot net. ( Fish shrimp )
}
return random(1000,2000);
} // end of method runFish

}// end of script[/code]</description>

              <p>RsResources Official Aryan Scripting Tutorial</p>
<p>Level: Beginner</p>
<p>[size=10pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Tutorial 1:</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p>Well welcome to the 1st actual tutorial of Aryan scripting im going to show you the basics and next tutorial we will start on a power fisher which will be built on during the beginners section of tutorials. So ill now show you the basics you need for a script.<br>
Script</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public class ScriptName extends Script
{

/* Base of a script */
public static String[] commands = {"run_command"};

public boolean start(String cmd, String[] args)
{

return true;

}

public long run(long lastExecuted)

// lets start running yay
{

return 0;

}
}</code></pre>
<p>That above is very messy and I apologise for it. Itâ€™s the whole table thing grrr. Honestly!</p>
<p>Anyways copy and compile that oh and save it as ScriptName.java and in the drop down menu, all files. This makes it a java file and not a plain old text file. Also Compiling basically turns a human readable language into a computer readable language which is binary code.</p>
<p>Well letâ€™s explain what each line does,</p>
<p><code>/* Base of a script */
// lets start running yay</code></p>
<p>These are comments. Comments are ignored by the compiler and are not included in the actual program. So what are they for?</p>
<p>When youâ€™re making a program or script, you will know exactly where everything is, hell you put it there, but when someone comes along and looks at it they may not be able to tell straight away where things are or what this is for etc. So you can use comments to help them out a bit. Also say you just want to leave a note to someone looking at the script you can use them as well for example you may want to say to someone.<br>
[tt]//DONT CHANGE THIS[/tt]</p>
<p>Because it could be used for the script to function properly.</p>
<p>Below are a few more examples and have nothing to do with Aryan. Donâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t understand anything up now.</p>
<p>[code]// This is put after script lines<br>
int 2006; // this is the year</p>
<p>/*</p>
<p>this is put if you want to make a whole paragraph of comments<br>
like a readme at the begginging of a script or something.</p>
<p>*/[/code]</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public class ScriptName extends Script</code></pre>
<p>This is declaring the class file and also that the class file extends “Script”, because it extends “Script”, your class has access to all the data and methods in the class “Script”. You have called this file “ScriptName” and therefore it must be saved as “ScriptName.java” otherwise you will get an error about being named wrong. Change the name to whatever you like. For example if youâ€™re making a powerMiner you may want to call it PowerMiner. So your first line will be.<br>
public class PowerMiner extends Script</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public static String[] commands = {"run_command"};</code></pre>
<p>This is where you declare what your run command will be. So letâ€™s see. Well use the powerMining example again. If your making a power miner you may like to use the run command “MineOre” , the command must be entirely unique , I mean what will happen if 2 script have the same run command ?</p>
<p>[code]public boolean start(String cmd, String[] args)<br>
{</p>
<p>return true;</p>
<p>}<br>
[/code]<br>
This returns true:<br>
False = dont start script<br>
True = Start script</p>
<p>So you may want to add a check in there. Something like</p>
<p>[code]if(inventoryCount(PickAxe) &lt; 1)<br>
{<br>
return false;</p>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>InventoryCount (PickAxe): This is obvious; itâ€™s seeing how many pickaxes you have.<br>
&lt; 1: This means smaller then one<br>
return false : Do not start script</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(inventoryCount(PickAxe) &lt; 1)</code></pre>
<p>This whole statement means. If pickaxe count is less then one donâ€™t start script. Basically if you donâ€™t have a pickaxe. You would need to declare what PickAxe is because at the moment there just words and the computer donâ€™t know what they are.</p>
<p>To get what a pickaxe actually is you need to go onto Aryan, right click a pickaxe and you will see itâ€™s Id. Then youâ€™d need to declare the id and assign it to pickaxe.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">int PickAxe = 123;</code></pre>
<p>Int means integer which basically means number. Char is for character and String is for a String of text, but to be honest just concentrates on int right now. The pickaxe id is a number and therefore we use int.</p>
<p>Now the script knows what itâ€™s counting. Itâ€™s counting the item in your inventory with the id 123. Simple.</p>
<p>[code]public long run(long lastExecuted)<br>
{</p>
<p>return 0;</p>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>This is where you have your script run. Most scripts use an execution of methods (ill explain that later). Thereâ€™s a few that just put the code straight in like this.</p>
<p>[code]public long run(long lastExecuted)<br>
{</p>
<p>log("Hello);<br>
log(“this script is running weeeee”);</p>
<p>return 0;</p>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>log prints the message inside the brackets and quotes to the Black Aryan screen. Also known as the ms-dos screen.</p>
<p>Well that concludes the first tutorial.</p>
<p>In the next one well have a bit more fun. This one has been nothing but reading so ill be surprised if you havenâ€™t fallen asleep by now. If you donâ€™t understand it donâ€™t worry! Still try the next tutorial, because the next is when you will be doing the coding.</p>

<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">TUTORIAL 2</span></span>[/size]<br>
RsResources Offical Aryan Scripting Tutorial</p>
<p>Level : Beginners</p>
<p>Tutorial 2 :</p>
<p>In this tutorial donâ€™t take everything literally as it is. Most of it is an example and wont work. However I can guarantee the end result will work (after the beginners set of tutorials are done) and all the examples will come together and you will understand at the end of this tutorial.</p>
<p>So we have covered the basics of what is needed in an Aryan scripting tutorial in order to be run.</p>
<p>Also see this for another example (scroll down the page to the code and read through it)</p>
<p>Now is enough of the reading. Now its time to start coding.</p>
<p>Please again let me stress if you do not understand donâ€™t worry im sure youâ€™ll pick it up later or if your getting agitated watch the <a href="http://www.seangreasley.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.seangreasley.com</a> video java tutorials , look for a tutorial on <a href="http://www.java.sun.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.java.sun.com</a> or get your butt out and buy a java book.</p>
<p>In this tutorial I am not going to write out a power fisher and explain it in each bit. I am going to go through it with you, and you will have to do the work (Arenâ€™t I nice?).</p>
<p>So firsts things first you need to know what fish you want your script to fish. I am going to be using shrimp as an example but you can use what you like. You will also need the id of the fish, id of the fishing spot and the id of your fishing net. To do this get on Aryan and find a shrimp fishing spot. Right click the spot and youâ€™ll have an id in the menu. Look at the picture below.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.rs-resources.com/IdUsageExample.JPG" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>This is how you obtain id<code>s for everything in Aryan. There are other ways to get id</code>s which can be useful in bot making but just use this one for now.</p>
<p>Declare the id youâ€™ve gotten from Aryan. For example you might do this.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public static final int FishingNet = 303; // id of fishing net
public static final int FishingSpot = 327; // id of fishing spot
public static final int[] Shrimp = 317; // id of shrimp[/code]

(Because itâ€™s final int it means it cannot be changed and you cannot reassign its value later in the script. I mean why would you need to? The shrimp id isnâ€™t going to change and neither is your net value)

You should declare it at the topic of your script because these need to be global. Globally declared variables can be accessed anywhere in the class. If you have an if statement likes this
[code]if (inventoryCount() != 27 ){
int Shrimp;
Shrimp = 317;
atNPC(FishingSpot, "Net");
}</code></pre>
<p>The variables Shrimp can only be used in that statement, it can only be accessed in that one if statement.</p>
<p>If later in your script you wanted to make another if statement likes this.</p>
<p><code>if (inventoryCount() = = 27 ){
Drop(Shrimp);
}
</code><br>
You wouldnâ€™t be able to do it because Shrimp wouldnâ€™t be declared (having Shrimp not being declared globally). Therefore if you declared something globally so everything can access it, and that is a major advantage.</p>
<p>Now Iâ€™ve just bombarded you with a lot of code which may all be new to you. So let me explain it.</p>
<p>!= means does not equal</p>
<p><code>if (inventoryCount() != 27 )
</code><br>
This means if your inventory count doesnâ€™t equal 27 do the next part, and the next part in the example I gave you is.</p>
<p><code>int FishingSpot;
FishingSpot = 327;
atNPC(FishingSpot, "Net");</code></p>
<p>so</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">int Shrimp;</code></pre>
<p>declaring shrimp</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Shrimp = 327;</code></pre>
<p>saying what value shrimp has.<br>
atNPC(FishingSpot, “Net”);</p>
<p>Actually fishing. An npc is a monster, basically, so more examples of npcs are Rats, Goblins, and Black Knights all stuff like that.</p>
<p>AtNpc is doing something at the npc</p>
<p>There then are 2 parameters you must use. If you look on <a href="http://www.wasteofmoney.org" rel="nofollow noopener">www.wasteofmoney.org</a> it says something like (I couldnâ€™t check completely because at the time of writing this <a href="http://wasteofmoney.org" rel="nofollow noopener">wasteofmoney.org</a> java docs was down)<br>
atNPC(int type , String index );</p>
<p>The type is the type of fish that your fishing, it takes the type as a number so there you can use FishingSpot because we have already declared that as a number.</p>
<p>Strings can hold text just as intâ€™s can hold numbers an example of a String is<br>
“Net” , “Hello there” , “go away” , " <a href="http://rs-resources.com" rel="nofollow noopener">rs-resources.com</a>"</p>
<p>Strings must always be enclosed in quotes “LIKE THIS”</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">atNPC(FishingSpot, "Net");</code></pre>
<p>So this is doing the index “Net” at the id FishingSpot(327). In not so many words net shrimp.</p>
<p>also</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">atNPC(int type , int index );</code></pre>
<p>If you look on Aryan. When you right click an npc youâ€™ll see there is a menu. This is roughly what it is when you right click a shrimp.</p>
<p><code>Net Shrimp
Examine Shrimp</code></p>
<p>To fish a shrimp using int index you would do<br>
atNPC(FishingSpot, 0 );</p>
<p>That would be using the int index and not string index. In most things counting starts at 1. ( 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) donâ€™t ask why but in most things in java it starts at 0. Arrays in java start at 0 for example.</p>
<p><code>Net Shrimp // this index is 0
Examine Shrimp // this index is 1</code></p>
<p>so you would want to net a fish and its index is 0 ( because its the first one) hence you would use<br>
atNPC(FishingSpot, 0 );</p>
<p>SO the whole statement means</p>
<p><code>if (inventoryCount() != 27 ){
int FishingSpot;
Shrimp = 327;
atNPC(FishingSpot, "Net");
}
</code><br>
If you have less then 27 items. Do some fishing. Now the next statement i showed you.</p>
<p><code>if (inventoryCount() = = 27 ){
Drop(Shrimp);
}</code></p>
<p>This means if you have 27 items in your inventory ( if inventoryCount equals 27 ) drop shrimp. In if statements you must use two equal signs ( like this “= =” ) because you are checking if something equals something you are not giving it a new value.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Shrimp = 106;</code></pre>
<p>That is giving shrimp a new value, and so you use one equal sign.</p>
<p>So the whole main point of that was to firstly show you why you must declare certain variables globally, and the reason basically is because it makes life a lot easier since you will be using the variable quite a lot.</p>
<p>So youâ€™re going to need a fishing method in your script. Something thing that will actually fish. You donâ€™t need to fish when you have a full inventory; you need to fish when your inventory is less then 27. This is where the &gt; and &lt; operators comes in.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">10 &gt; 1</code></pre>
<p>That means 10 is bigger then one.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">200 &lt; 1000</code></pre>
<p>That means 200 is smaller then 1000.</p>
<p>So whatâ€™s the point of them, how can they be used? Ill show you, look at this If statement.</p>
<p><code>if (inventoryCount() &lt; 27 ){
atNPC(FishingSpot, "Net");
}</code></p>
<p>Now you dont need to declare shrimp because that should have already been declared globaly, so that means if you have less then 27 items in your inventory. Fish .</p>
<p>Now you can make a method for that and call it Fish.</p>
<p>[code]<br>
private long runFish()<br>
{</p>
<p>if (inventoryCount() &lt; 27 )<br>
{<br>
atNPC(FishingSpot, “Net”);<br>
}<br>
}[/code]</p>
<p>There go that is a method. But how do you execute it in your script ?</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">runFish();</code></pre>
<p>Is how you would use it?</p>
<p>So whenever you want your script to fish. You use it by typing Fish ();</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s the whole concept of it but thereâ€™s one more problem we have to face</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">atNpc(int type , String index);</code></pre>
<p>the fishing spot must be declared<br>
public NPC FishingSpot;</p>
<p>But you cannot do</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public NPC FishingSpot = 327;</code></pre>
<p>Simply because it doesnâ€™t allow you to and if you compile you will receive errors. So to get over this you can do</p>
<p>public NPC fishingNPC;</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">fishingNPC = findNPCByType(fishingSpot);</code></pre>
<p>and thats how you get over that problem. Hehe</p>
<p>Returns</p>
<p>If you return a -1 that stops the script</p>
<p>If you return a positive value, it will pause for that many milliseconds and then go back over the run method from the beginning. I.e. if you return</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Return 1000;</code></pre>
<p>Itâ€™ll wait for 1 second.<br>
If you return a method, it basically returns the method<br>
Returns must be put at the end of a method.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s basically the end of this tutorial and im going to put everything together at the bottom now for you so you should be able to see, what you should have now.</p>
<p>[code]<br>
public class PFisher extends Script<br>
{</p>
<p>public static String[] commands = {“PFish”}; // choose what command you want . Ive chosen PFish for power fish<br>
/* Ive Globely Decalred Varibles here */<br>

<p>}</p>
<p>public long run(long lastExecuted)<br>
{</p>
<p>return runFish(); // excecute runFish Method</p>

}<br>
