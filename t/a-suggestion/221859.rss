    <description>No, im not spamming the website because i dont use it much. Im saying the for the good of the community. 

[size=20pt]Demote ruler[/size]

My reasons:

1. He acts like a little girl and whines over nothing
2. He brings random shit to the forum when it has nothing to do with us.
3. He is a friggen idiot, i mean who posts an image in the community member section, about a add?

Otherwise, as this is an insufficient ammount of reasons, remove his privellage of seeing this board. All he has done if make random gay topics. I thought this board was here essentialy to protect the upper community from &quot;n00bz&quot;or maybe the administrator who created this board got it wrong. And if you want to be a smartass and say that ruler has been here longer than me, fine demote me too i dont give a shit. Also he may not be a n00b but he obviously doesnt have a life.

Oh try not to cry whilst reading this ruler.</description>

In all likelihood that will not be permanent. Ruler was de-community membered as he continued to leak information from this section after explicit requests to cease and desist all passing of internal information (‘internal information’ can be defined as anything hidden from public view - I’m obviously not referring to staff discussion) to external parties.</p>
<p>No, he wasn’t de-CM’d because one or two of you dislike him and the rest of you decided to jump aboard the anti-ruler bandwagon.</p>

<p>Buttt, only thing I found wrong with your post Semaphore was that when you finished with the line: “you add humor to this forum”. He doesn’t add humor, he adds frustration and annoyance to people who have to put up with him. I just don’t understand how he hasn’t been banned for spamming or trolling.</p>
<p>@ ruler:<br>
You’ve <span class="bbcode-i">revealed</span> someone? Who have you revealed? Oh, and please save your time by saving you revealed me asking about running a web server on a 64-bit archetype. I even asked it here, so, save your breath. Oh, and, the youtube account you found of mine which goes by the name of ‘Yz85Racer’? Whilst you’re at it, ruler, why not find my <a href="http://motocross.com" rel="nofollow noopener">motocross.com</a> account, my xBox live account, my hotmail account, my mxchat account. I’ll save you the time, they all go by the same name of ‘Yz85Racer’. However that may be a little hard for your course-failing brain to comprehend.</p>

<p>See? I can quote random, stupid things too…</p>
<p>Fine. You and Genodemon are two different people. I seriously lost interest about three seconds after I clicked the ‘Post’ button on the thread. I’m flattered that you think so much about me that you keep a tally of things I say. Really, thanks. I wish I could say that I remember much of what we’ve argued about… I only remember that we have argued… and even that means very little to me.</p>
<p>I really cannot believe you actually mentioned rep.</p>
<p>I’m curious, when you say you’ve <span class="bbcode-i">revealed</span> people, do you think that you’ve somehow <span class="bbcode-i">revealed</span> me? Seriously? Is that your game? Well, I guess if you can’t code, you <span class="bbcode-i">reveal</span>.</p>
<p>Have you ever imagined that the only reason you are abused is because most see right through your hubris and delusions? I mean, who really cares about some <span class="bbcode-i">soap opera</span> quality gossip about joe forum user and bob forum user somehow sharing a tunnel. Get a clue? Are there high visibility people that are actually the same person? I know of a couple for certain. The thing is, who cares? One of the reasons I don’t visit facebook or myspace is because if <span class="bbcode-b">gossip</span> is what you want… go there… now.</p>
<p>As for your retarded brother being in <span class="bbcode-i">cheating</span> scenes… I’ve never seen him. I’ve been in some fairly exclusive cheating circles for some huge games and I know for a fact you wouldn’t last after your first post. Valhalla Legends stands out in my mind… You think you’re mocked here… those guys would crucify you for the crap that seems to be your bread and butter.</p>
<p>ruler, I seriously have nothing against you until you make <span class="bbcode-u">stupid</span> <span class="bbcode-b">ass</span>umptions and accusations. You’ve probably been misinterpreted, misquoted, misunderstood, and mistaken on quite a few things. I don’t hold grudges. I just don’t care enough to.</p>
<p>One thing is certain, you add humor to this forum… albeit unintentionally.</p>

<p>[quote=“ruler, post:12, topic:163991”]update and some additions<br>
according to a gmod here:<br>
Semaphore and pplsuqballz have used the same ip.</p>
<p>Semaphore’s irc explanations:<br>
Semaphore and pplsuqballz share a “http tunnel”<br>
Posting timing be similara re due to both of them being on msn and talking.<br>
pplsuqballz shares passwords with people.[/quote]</p>
<p>me and genodemon and different people.  I don’t spend alot of timing writing high quality posts.  I basically talk in a stream of consciousness.</p>
<p>Anyways i had 175 rep at kaitnieks.  I have revealed alot of people and made alot of enemies.  I don’t have many friends but those i do have are of the highest quality.  I have made a good chunk of post and topics in the cm.</p>
<p>My Brother genodemon has been in cheating longer then most of you and probably will still be here long after your gone.</p>
<p>He may be right the site is going toward more of a social forum.  I see people from my site joing here and wanting to learn and since they are not part of the social fabric here they are treated like outsiders and abused.</p>

</aside>
<p>I have to agree. From my point of view (That being the view of a dude who has stood back from the “Ruler is a dumbass” bandwagon, be it a bandwagon or fact) he is degrading the community. I know many community members, including me, that have never given a contribution to our community, but most of us are nice people.</p>
<p>Then there is ruler who not only does not contribute to our community but a high percentage of his posts recently is stuff that no one here cares about and acts as kindling for flame wars to begin.</p>
<p>Also we all know that <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> and <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a> are very different places. Therefore <span class="bbcode-b">if</span> someone from <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> irc is attacking another community/website (Rulers or w/e) then don’t fucking post it on <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a> , discuss it in <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span>.</p>
