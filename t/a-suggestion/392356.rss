    <description>Could you possibly hide servers ip addresses on the server status page? That way, it&#39;d be harder for ddosers to find the ips of peoples servers. I don&#39;t see the point of exposing them in the first place.</description>

<p>I thought this was exactly what the server status page was.  People post their servers, with descriptions, and you can click to play them immediately inside of MoparScape.  Soon you will be able to upload your own client to play in MoparScape as well, I just haven’t added that yet.</p>

</aside>
<p>As you’ve said in previous posts, we upload our client to run inside MoparScape. All of us have a cache which our client requires, most of which are unique from others. What’s stopping anyone from having some form of virus inside their cache, then having code within their client which executes the virus at client runtime? It wouldn’t be hard at all, any idiot could do it.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Both your questions have the same answer, MoparScape 4 executes all clients inside a very restrictive SecurityManager, with only the permissions required to run the client.  In fact, you can’t execute native code, you can’t use any reflection, the only website you can contact is the server MoparScape is currently pointed to, and the only file you have read or write access to is your own personal cache folder that is unique to your client.  This means the one and only malicious thing a client could do would be to fill up a user’s hard drive.</p>
<p>With a configuration like that, any user can run any client in MoparScape 4 secure in the knowledge that no malicious code can be ran on their computer.</p>
<p>So that is the main reason for me requiring all users of the server status page to use MoparScape 4, so that no idiots infect users, and I don’t have to constantly check to make sure no server status page posts link to viruses.</p>
<p>Did that answer your questions or concerns?[/quote]</p>
<p>Alright, thanks for clearing that up.</p>

Simply because a lot of people, myself included, won’t want to do this. I think it’s great that you’ve made a client that others can easily use and integrate with their own clients, but that doesn’t mean everyone will want to. If you force it, people will leave. The ones leaving will also be your more bigger servers that probably don’t really need your top list anyway.</p>
<p>That’s my opinion at least.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Why wouldn’t you want to?  Users can instantly play your server, jagex won’t be after you for hosting their code, and you have the option of not using any of your bandwidth and sharing the client and/or cache via bittorrent (which is much faster than an HTTP download).[/quote]</p>
<p>The jagex argument isn’t that great either. If jagex wants to come after me for simply hosting the server, they will because they know they have more money than me. I also know that they have more money than me, so if they ever came after me, even with absolutely no legal grounds, I would back off and stop. I don’t exactly feel like getting into any sort of legal issue over a private server. Jagex will come after you based on your server’s influence, not whether or not you are using their client.</p>
<p>Besides, with server that are TONS bigger than my own, I highly doubt jagex would target little ol’ me just to make me an example. Taking down someone like…near reality for example, would make a MUCH better example than me, who gets roughly 100 players a day…</p>

<p>People love have to own things, like they can tell other people. Look <a href="http://balbla.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://balbla.com</a> is my server. You can play on MY own client ect… And not, look you can play my server on this different site: <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> which I do not own. Its just no fun.</p>

<p>Why wouldn’t you want to?  Users can instantly play your server, jagex won’t be after you for hosting their code, and you have the option of not using any of your bandwidth and sharing the client and/or cache via bittorrent (which is much faster than an HTTP download).</p>

<p>No problem, because your client can run inside of MoparScape 4.  All you have to do is implement an interface and it will run inside of MoparScape 4, and be much easier for you as well.</p>

Very soon now, all servers on the server status page will be required to use MoparScape 4 to connect.  So that’s not an issue anyway, besides, even if the ip is hidden and it can only be connected to with a specific client, the IP is still easily obtained (like if you wanted to attack it or something else).  If you have any server to which other people connect to, your IP must be public, no exceptions.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>won’t us needing to allow the moparscape 4 client to connect to our server mean that we have to allow cheat clients to connect also?[/quote]</p>
<p>No, because you can write a custom client just like the ones you already use to run inside MoparScape 4.  MoparScape 4 has no ‘cheat’ features, just a music player, screenshot taker, and various other helpful things.</p>
