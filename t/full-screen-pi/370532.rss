#317 Fullscreen renamed [Galkons base] Client


You can choose between the client with 474 models, or 525 models.
PM me to negotiate a reasonable cost.
Just going to point out that the Fullscreen feature on a 317 server will bring an extra 50 - 100 players.


Payment methods:
PayPal - Preferred 
RuneScape Account 
RuneScape Membership PIN 
Onebip 

525 look-a-like Client Features:

Equipment switching sounds enabled. 
Fullscreen/standard size mode. 
Compatible with all 317 servers with slight server Player class edits. 
Most 525 Decompressed Models. 
525 Emote Interface with fully functioning emotes. 
Most 474 Maps in their own cache. 
474 GameFrame &amp; Interfaces. 
New RS Chat Engine. 
525 Animations &amp; Graphics (Dragon Claws, Skillcapes, Godswords, etc.) 
Savable account on login. 
Current RuneScape background fading. (On login screen) 
Current RuneScape title Background. 
Toggle hit-points above head, new cursors, and highlight mod chat. 

474 look-a-like Client Features:
