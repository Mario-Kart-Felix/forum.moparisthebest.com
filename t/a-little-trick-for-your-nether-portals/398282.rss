    <title>A little trick for your Nether Portals</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-little-trick-for-your-nether-portals/398282</link>
    <description>As many of you notice, in 1.6 the Nether portals do not link up, they spawn you in random locations. 

This however is only from Earth - Nether portals, making a Nether - Earth portal will correctly link your portals, heres how to get it right.

The nether portal operation works on a 1:8 ratio, whatever your coordinates on earth are, when you enter the Nether portal, it will divide your X and Z by 8. Y is 1:1. Atleast thats how its supposed to be, however its not working correctly for Earth - Nether portals, but it does work for Nether - Earth portals!

In order to get a correct link going, you will need to make a portal in the nether that is a 1:8 ratio of your coordinates on earth.

So let&#39;s say your coordinates on earth are X: 1600 Y: 60 Z: 800, you would need to make a Nether portal to Earth at X: 200 Y: 60: Z: 100.

When you create a portal to earth in the nether, you will automatically exit through the nearest portal given there is one, so your calculations can have a good bit of error and still get you to the right place :)

tl;dr

Earth - Nether portals do not work atm in 1.6, but Nether - Earth portals do, go to your earth coordinates/8 (except Y) in the Nether and make a portal and you will end up in your area on earth.</description>
