    <title>Have you ever been beaten up?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/have-you-ever-been-beaten-up/429666</link>
    <description>Last Weekend, i shall not tell a cool tuff guy story!,
oke last weekend i was in a bar incredeably drunk and for some reason a guy started to push me :s

so i pushed him back and i was so slow and drunk that i didnt saw him hitting me, he gave me a few pucnhes XD, and when he did, i was like wtf and i was like stunned for some reason.

then a guy came between us, but i started to get kinda angry now and drunk so i hitted that guy on his head who came between us XD ( a mistake), wich gave me a club ban, i may never set any step in that night club again.

and now i&#39;m sitting here with a hurting jaw :s


so my question is have you ever been beaten up???</description>

<p>Probably because they feel sorry for you. 4th Grade, correct me if I’m wrong isn’t that when your level 9? I have a different grading system here and if I’m right, nobody considers that type of age group as a fight lol.<br>

<p>^ sorry for rant lol.  on topic; the last fight i can remember being in was 4th grade with some huge blonde kid.  he beat my ass.  lover not a fighter lol  :P[/quote]</p>
<p>here in holland we dont have to be 21 to go to the bar, we actualy may drink on 16, also the security always allow kids from 14/15 xd<br>
( I’m 16)</p>
<p>also since english isnt my mother Language, i speak 4 Languages.</p>

              <p>Lawl, Yeah…<br>
I’ve been ‘beaten up’ once.<br>
I was down in Everett at the Bus Station, maybe about 9-11PM some black guy came up to me (im now 17, was 15-16 at the time), but he asked me for my shoes!</p>
<p>So I said haha, fuck no you aint gettin my shoes LOL, next thing i know…<br>
I’m walkin down the street north up the hill to catch a different bus (hits there faster), i’m about 1/3 up the hill when…<br>
BAM, POW, KICK.<br>
These black thugs come up from behind me (one of em), just starts wompin on me for like 4 seconds.<br>
Next thing I know, i’m on the ground, i see my shoes…<br>
Like 10ft that way ----&gt; (guy really knocked me out my jordans) (GROWN ass man).<br>
I get up and turn around and BOOM, I got some ghetto ass drunk white girl runnin @ me just swingin, pow, pow, pow!<br>
I got up they took my shoes, I get on the bus, (I can hear them in the back talkin shit)<br>
LOL @ ME, I went up and sat in the front of the bus. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
But yeah, I could hear em back their lookin @ me, pointin, “Ah, I got that nigga good huh”, “YUP, right in dah chin”.<br>
I just sat there holdin my jaw sheddin silent tears.</p>
<p>But…<br>
I got off way before my stop (take a breather), at a gas station, this kind little church guy’s waiting at the bus stop, sees me, I tell him what happened, he gives me like 40$, tells me his wife’s on the way, and she’ll give me a ride to where i’m going, than as im getting out of the car they give me a new pair of shoes =D.</p>
<p>AND CHECK THIS SHIT OUT.<br>
They dropped me off at wendy’s in Everett on 128th, ‘Airport road’ so I can meet my Sister Yolanda, so i get in her truck, we’re sittin there infront of wendy’s she goes inside.<br>
I’m out in the car talking to my other sister ‘Zarminah’, than out of no where…<br>
A COP…<br>
Comes knocking on the window.<br>
MY SISTER…<br>
Set me up!.<br>
(I had a warrent)<br>
(Said it was for my own good, but yeah wtf!?!?)</p>
<p>Anyways…<br>
There’s my beatdown story from back when I was a little hoodlum.</p>
