    <title>562 Any way to reset econ w/o deleting player files?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-any-way-to-reset-econ-w-o-deleting-player-files/354676</link>
    <description>Just wondering if there is any way to reset economy on a 562, I know there are multiple bat files for 317&#39;s and stuff, but never seen a 562, anyone got suggestions???


ALSO IF ANYONE KNOWS, HOW DO I ALLOW SOMEONE TO DROP ITEMS, it&#39;s something to do with destroyitem or sumtin.

Thanks in advance.</description>
