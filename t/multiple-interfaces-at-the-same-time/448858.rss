    <title>Multiple interfaces at the same time</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/multiple-interfaces-at-the-same-time/448858</link>
    <description>Hi there. I&#39;ve began on a new project.
I&#39;m creating a RS Remake, just to mess around with to become better with Java.
But I&#39;ve stumbled onto a problem.
Whenever I&#39;m trying to create two or more interfaces at the same time.
Only one of them appears, and the second one completely vanishes.
Example:

[code]	public void addStarter() {
		c.getPA().showInterface(3559);
		c.canChangeAppearance = true;
	}[/code]
My addStarter method to open up the Character Creation interface, the first time a player logs in.


[code]public void TutorialIsland(Client c) {
 		DialogueHandler.sendStartInfo(c, &quot;To start the tutorial use your left mouse button to click on the&quot;, 
				&quot;RuneScape Guide in this room. He is indicated by a flashing&quot;, 
				&quot;yellow arrow above his head. If you can&#39;t see him, use your&quot;,
				&quot;keyboard&#39;s arrow keys to rotate the view.&quot;, 
				&quot;Getting started&quot;);
	}[/code]
My TutorialIsland method to send a chat interface, containing the text above.

Now, my problem is, that it only shows the Character Creation and not this.

Btw, it&#39;s a Project Insanity base. I can&#39;t remember which one, because I downloaded it probably a year ago, as a cleaned out PI</description>

The real problem can’t be fixed by your method <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>

              <p>I don’t think that is possible because whenever you try to load one it’ll close when you try to open another one</p>
<p>maybe you should just add the items to the player’s inventory rather then show the interface?</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>you could do something like</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public boolean starterAdded;</code></pre>
<p><code>public void TutorialIsland(Client c) {
if(starterAdded = true) {
                 DialogueHandler.sendStartInfo(c, "To start the tutorial use your left mouse button to click on the",
                                "RuneScape Guide in this room. He is indicated by a flashing",
                                "yellow arrow above his head. If you can't see him, use your",
                                "keyboard's arrow keys to rotate the view.",
                                "Getting started")"
}
        }</code></p>
<p>Then whereever your actionbuttons are you could make it so that when the close button of the interface is closed it’ll then send the dialogue</p>
<p>I don’t know how action buttons work in p.i but it could be something like</p>
<p><code>case CLOSEINTERFACEBUTTON:
c.starterAdded = true;
break;</code></p>
<p>I’m sure i might of done something wrong there but hopefully you get the idea of what im trying to get at</p>
