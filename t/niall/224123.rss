Wow, you are the climax of all faggetory, some of those comments are hardly worth a mute/warn.

<p>Now, lets be frank, you all(you know who you are) whine and moan about the idiots here, but when you’re the ones acting like it and get punished for it, you whine about it. To add to that, most of you are hypocrites.</p>

<p>That’s the thing, when I “lay off” on some people, I get moaned at by the same people who I wasn’t so strict on, when I completely remove favouritism from my decisions I also get moaned at. You all(again, you know who you are) want a perfect forum full of perfect people, and some of you have tried this with “invite only” forums, but to my knowledge, they don’t work since you all end up returning here and moaning about how things are being run. Perhaps you should come on the IRC channel where the rules aren’t enforced as much.</p>
<p>EDIT: Next time, I’d prefer it if you did come on IRC and talk to me there rather than posting a thread like this.</p>

<p>Just because he doesn’t fucking smoke pot, drink his way to sleep, or cut his wrist in his free time doesn’t mean you idiots have to go about attacking him. Niall was right with what he gave them, although I do admit the fact jme only received a warning while the others had it worse was wrong.</p>
<p>The elitist faggotry here is getting worse and worse. Forums die because of you guys, and I’m suprised this one retains any interest.</p>
