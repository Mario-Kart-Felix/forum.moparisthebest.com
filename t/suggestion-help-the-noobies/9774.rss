    <title>Suggestion: Help the noobies</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/suggestion-help-the-noobies/9774</link>
    <description>Why doesn&#39;t anyone here help the people who ask for SERIOUS HELP? I can understand someone like: OMG HALP HOW I START SERVER PLZ. But civil questions, I myself am a &quot;senior member&quot; and know a bit about java and can get by on my own usually. But when I need help I don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s worth asking for because one of two things happens usually:
1: Nothing
2: someone esle says &quot;I need this too&quot;
There are many amazing coders on this website who post some great tuts. But the tuts are getting repetitive and leeched ALL the time. I wish people would help other people asking a normal, civil question.</description>

              <p>After private servers move to <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a>, there should be less questions in total and more of them in the correct boards, which should aid in the answering of all questions. Until then just answer as many as you can ;D</p>
