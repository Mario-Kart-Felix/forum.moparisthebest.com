    <title>Help - my server is blocked</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-my-server-is-blocked/152336</link>
    <description>I have been doing game servers for some time. I have over 120,000 accounts on my rs2 server when suddenly it stoped working.

I tried formating, Then using a older backup I know works, I get no connections back to me.

My port is all set right, there perfect no questions asked.

I have no firewalls on at all, Not in Windows or my router.

I tried reseting the cable box, and the router, Still I get nuthing.

I tried some commands like ipconfig with /release and /renew.

I tried a different port.

To say the least something is blocking players from connecting. There was 1 player who can get on, no1 knows why he can get on.

I have tried everything I can think of, whats left to try??


Someone help me please. Thx from marco</description>

<p>Did you switch to verizon? They block a port that doesn’t let incoming traffic connect.</p>
