    <title>[317 Netty PI] Aggroth Redone - Looking for reliable developers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-netty-pi-aggroth-redone-looking-for-reliable-developers/548586</link>
    <description>[b]Hello MoparScape.

Most of you will know me as &quot;Shaloxis&quot;, and others will know me as ofcourse Thrallix.
I am an old member of the RuneScape Private Servers world, lets say 2009...
And i&#39;ve hosted several big servers.

Dragonic-Scape had over 100 players daily.
Aggroth easily had 400-700 every single day.

Now i won&#39;t lie, i loved Aggroth.
But i had several real-life issues, and i needed those resolved before i continued my project.
I was going to pass it through to one of my co-owners, but they have proven themselves unreliable, and not trustworthy of something like Aggroth.
I am planning on restarting Project Aggroth, under the name; Aggroth Redone.

I will be making a comeback, i&#39;m sure.
But i have no time to develop as much as i used to.

What i need is the following: 

Atleast 2 Java Developers...
Atleast 1 GFX...
Atleast 2 Moderators

Further i will need some trustworthy people to manage my forums.
I will pay the developers when we have reached an good player base, which won&#39;t take long.
I do need the money now for advertisements, the host, and the webhost, and i don&#39;t have that much right now.
So please don&#39;t worry about that.

Now there are some requirements.
I will decide wether you fit for the position or not.
Format:

Real life name:

Age:

Why should you be picked as a *?:

What are you applying for?:

Do you have skype? If so, what is it?

Do you have any experience at all?

Thank you![/spoiler]
[b]
Thank you for reading all this, and i hope you consider joining Aggroth Redone.



Oh, right, about the base:

We are currently running on a EXTREMELY clean Netty PI, with 14 added player ranks and 600+ data, with 508/525 maps.

Thank you![/b]</description>

<p>Why should you be picked as a *?: I think I should be picked because I have great knowledge of programing rsps, I have coded 1 and currently coding another, I have made servers but not released them of your previous bases so I know your coding and work, I have studied javac and have knowledge in many angles such as web development and server and client development, if there is plans on hosting I can help chip in to pay for the resources needed, plus I will not need any payment as I do it out of the satisfaction not money</p>
<p>What are you applying for?: Developer</p>
<p>Do you have skype? If so, what is it? search me by my email which is ; <a href="mailto:williamcoleman15@outlook.com">williamcoleman15@outlook.com</a></p>
<p>Do you have any experience at all? yes, please read above for which I have explained</p>

              <p>Real life name:</p>
<p>Age:15</p>
<p>Why should you be picked as a *?:I have played runescape since 2006, I quit during the free trade period and have actively played runescape private servers since 2012. I have been part of glitching communities from 2013-2014, until I caught on to the fact that all they are interested in is ruining peoples playing experience. So I have a knowledge of how rsps work. I also am very knowledgeable in the game, so hns is my forte.</p>
<p>What are you applying for?:Just something like a helper. I want to help this server achieve what aggroth servers should, perfection.</p>
<p>Do you have skype? If so, what is it?If you want my skype, pm me. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>Do you have any experience at all?I have been Helper on: Runeproject<br>
mod on a small server called Infinty-realm<br>
and a well known player on Mbscape (70 players), runeproject, at one point grinderscape and more.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Why should you be picked as a *?: I should be picked as a moderator because I have owned a few servers myself, now granted most of them are leeches (forgive me) because I do not know how to code well so I am usually the Financial Adviser. Even though this sources were leeches, I still managed to get 10-30 players on because of my skills/knowledge on knowing how to get people to stay. I have also been mod on Anxiety-pk, I was staff on perfectionx and resigned, I was also moderator on deadlypkers. I have a good bit of knowledge in how to run servers and know what to do in situations that can effect the server, such as hackers, ddosers, etc. I also believe my age puts me apart from the younger audience, because of my maturity and experience and have noticed from the past older people do well better then younger. Below are a few servers I have ran just to show you my experience, please forgive the quality of some of it was when i first started and had no clue. Please do not judge me based off of these if you have seen before.</p>

              <p>Real life name: Matthew Lethen</p>
<p>Age: 16</p>
<p>Why should you be picked as a *?: I’ve decided to apply for the graphic design team because of my high level of knowledge in using the software and hardware required to be on a graphic design team. I’ve made art all of my life, and am taking a few extra classes in school that are based around art and computing. I’ve self-taught myself, along with professional tutoring, the ability to draw professional art in Photoshop and Illustrator, I’ve also been working for a few small home-owned businesses that need a start off. I would LOVE to be a graphic designer for this if it actually gets large, and even as a small server I can’t wait to work here if I were to be chosen. I work well with others, get work done when asked and anything extra even without being asked, I’m mature, I don’t argue unless given a reason to argue [I usually stay out of those situations], and I am always pleasant to other players and staff members.</p>
<p>What are you applying for?: A position on the Graphic Design team.</p>
<p>Do you have skype? If so, what is it? I do; “cubicartsbusiness”.</p>
<p>Do you have any experience at all? As said, I’ve been working with this software for years on end, and have been artistic and creative all of my life.</p>
<p>I  hope to talk to you soon, please add my Skype for further questions.</p>
