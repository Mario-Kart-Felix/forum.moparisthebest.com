    <title>ProfScape - Looking for some good coders and graphic artists</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/profscape-looking-for-some-good-coders-and-graphic-artists/340363</link>
    <description>Hello everybody,

First, I will introduce myself. I am Bas, I&#39;m 16 years old and I live in Holland.
I have my own registered web-design company, and i have a lot of experience with HTML, Java, PHP, CSS, MYSQL, ASP, JavaScript, AJAX and a littlebit C sharp.
I am going to make a very nice server, based of the DavidScape source, because I think it&#39;s the best 508 around at the moment. I am already busy with the website, and it&#39;s looking pretty good. Ofcourse the server will be HD, and we&#39;re going to make the server just like RS, so no customs etc.

So, I am looking for a nice team. Here are the people I need:

[ul][li]3 Java coders, you need good experience with Java and RS Private Servers;[/li]
[li]1 PHP coder, you need experience with HTML, PHP, mysql and JavaScript;[/li]
[li]2Graphic Artists, you need to be good with Paint ;], obviously you need to be good in RuneScape Graphics.[/li][/ul]


Please do not apply in this thread, but please PM me, and please be serious, I really want a good team to work with, and together we&#39;re going to make the best 508 server around!

Thanks for reading, 
Bas</description>
