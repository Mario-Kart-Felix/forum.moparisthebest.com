    <description>[center][b][u][size=18pt]This is a re-release of Aggroth V4, the source was edited by Sk8rdude461, this is the same exact source with the MySQL disabled[/size][/u][/b][/center]



[center][b]Original Source Release:[/b]
https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,664755.0.html

[b]Change&#39;s that were made:[/b]
[quote=&quot;Sk8rdude461&quot;]Hey guys, I&#39;ve just done a couple of  &quot;fixes&quot; because I&#39;m tired of seeing 800 help topics over the EXACT SAME issues. Literally.
So here&#39;s what I did:
Edited the client compiler, now compiles the signlink file in the signlink folder.
Changed the client IP to localhost. Search &quot;localhost&quot; in client.java to change it.
Compiled the client.
Ran the client.
Verified the client works and the cache downloaded
Ran the server.
Logged into client from server.
Disabled most, if not all MySQL data. It&#39;s controlled by the boolean I added in Config.java
Compiled server.
Ran server.
Tested once by logging in, no MySQL related errors on login.
I did not change any core functions or components, or anything really. I simply added a boolean to control the MySQL.

99.99% credits to Shaloxis or Coldmedicine or whoever made it.

.000000001% for me disabled MySQL and recompiling.[/quote]

[b]Credits:[/b]
Coldmedicene (Cant be arsed naming all that)
Ryan (Fixed ALOT of bugs and added a nice quest)
InsidiaX (Base)
TrisidiaX (Skilltab)
Tokashi (508 maps)
Sk8rdude461 (Disabling MySQL and making this super easy to run, and host for beginners / unexperienced programmers)


[b]No errors on startup, and this was downloaded and ran no edit needed:[/b]

Hey guys I am new and was trying out the source and stuff you guys provided, I edited the compilers and such to my current version of JDK.<br>
The problem I have is that it isn’t compiling, it says "Note: client.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.<br>
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details."<br>
I read on here those don’t impact the compiler doing what it is supposed to, but I changed my rights to owner and gave my self some dung points and it didn’t work at all.<br>
It would help a lot if you let me know what I have to do to correct this?<br>
I was looking around to try to fix it, but I can’t find a solution.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Those 2 messages are notes.<br>
They don’t do much more than what they say.</p>
<p>If no errors showed in the compiler, and only those notes do, then you compiled successfully.</p>
<p>As for changing rights/points: You can only manipulate a character file when they are <span class="bbcode-b">not</span> logged in. If you edit it while they are logged in, the server will just overwrite the changes (Between when you made them and when they logout).[/quote]</p>
<p>For some reason I can not find the cache, can anyone tell me where to find it?</p>

Lol remove the topic all you want, I’m not removing the download.</p>
<p>Mostly because you knew about it, and I had even said something about it on your thread. Which I’m pretty sure is where Fohammer got the idea to post this topic in the first place.</p>
<p>Also, how long does it take you to notice things holy hell?</p>
<p>Here’s proof you knew about it:</p>
<p>[quote=“sk8rdude461, post:28, topic:545873”]I’ve edited Aggroth V4 and made a copy of it avalible <a href="http://rsps.canyourcode.com/Julia/Aggroth_Edited.zip" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a><br>
I added <span class="bbcode-b">one single text file</span> that explains everything I did.<br>
Please understand I did literally no extensive testing. The <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">only</span></span> test I did was logging in.</p>
<p>Here’s the contents of the text file I added:</p>
<p>[quote]Hey guys, I’ve just done a couple of  “fixes” because I’m tired of seeing 800 help topics over the EXACT SAME issues. Literally.<br>
So here’s what I did:<br>
Edited the client compiler, now compiles the signlink file in the signlink folder.<br>
Changed the client IP to localhost. Search “localhost” in client.java to change it.<br>
Compiled the client.<br>
Ran the client.<br>
Verified the client works and the cache downloaded<br>
Ran the server.<br>
Logged into client from server.<br>
Disabled most, if not all MySQL data. It’s controlled by the boolean I added in Config.java<br>
Compiled server.<br>
Ran server.<br>
Tested once by logging in, no MySQL related errors on login.<br>
I did not change any core functions or components, or anything really. I simply added a boolean to control the MySQL.</p>
<p>99.99% credits to Shaloxis or Coldmedicine or whoever made it.</p>
<p>.000000001% for me disabled MySQL and recompiling.[/quote]</p>
<p>As far as I know, it works. I logged in and there was no MySQL issues, and the cache also downloaded fine.<br>
It’s up to you know.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">[size=14pt]<a href="http://rsps.canyourcode.com/Julia/Aggroth_Edited.zip" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Here’s the download once more. In case you didn’t see me say it before</a>[/size]</span>[/quote]<br>
And the reply directly underneath that?:</p>

<p>[quote=“Sk8rdude461”]Hey guys, I’ve just done a couple of  “fixes” because I’m tired of seeing 800 help topics over the EXACT SAME issues. Literally.<br>
So here’s what I did:<br>
Edited the client compiler, now compiles the signlink file in the signlink folder.<br>
Changed the client IP to localhost. Search “localhost” in client.java to change it.<br>
Compiled the client.<br>
Ran the client.<br>
Verified the client works and the cache downloaded<br>
Ran the server.<br>
Logged into client from server.<br>
Disabled most, if not all MySQL data. It’s controlled by the boolean I added in Config.java<br>
Compiled server.<br>
Ran server.<br>
Tested once by logging in, no MySQL related errors on login.<br>
I did not change any core functions or components, or anything really. I simply added a boolean to control the MySQL.</p>
<p>99.99% credits to Shaloxis or Coldmedicine or whoever made it.</p>
<p>.000000001% for me disabled MySQL and recompiling.[/quote]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Credits:</span><br>
Coldmedicene (Cant be arsed naming all that)<br>
Ryan (Fixed ALOT of bugs and added a nice quest)<br>
InsidiaX (Base)<br>
TrisidiaX (Skilltab)<br>
Tokashi (508 maps)<br>
Sk8rdude461 (Disabling MySQL and making this super easy to run, and host for beginners / unexperienced programmers)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">No errors on startup, and this was downloaded and ran no edit needed:</span><br>
