    <description>Hi guys I am looking for 1-2 rsps coders to work with me on a project. . What I am looking for is someone who has made a couple servers in the past, can patch dupes and glitches, add custom areas/ items, ect. This will be a long project and will reward us both greatly in the future. I have great ideas which NO other servers have and it will make us popular because of it.

Please use this form:

What type of server is your favorite?(317 ect):
How much experience do you have in coding?:
Why should I choose you?:
Willing to split payments for VPS, ect?:
Age:
Rate yourself 1-10 on your coding:
What else can you code apart from rsps?:
Hours available per day: 
Would you prefer coding the server by yourself or with another coder?:
Got skype?
Add anything notable here:

Please don&#39;t post your contact details here. I will PM via Sythe, those who I would like to work with. 

Regards,

Amin</description>

              <p>I’d be glad to help out but here is my thing YOU have to prove that you aren’t an idiot programmer first. I LOVE creating new content but I will NOT work with incompetent programmers. I also do not “patch dupes/glitches” I leave for the other developer(s) as I would be purely content based. (I make what I want in reason of course)</p>
