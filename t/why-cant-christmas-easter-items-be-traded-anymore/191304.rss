    <title>Why can&#39;t christmas / easter items be traded anymore?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-cant-christmas-easter-items-be-traded-anymore/191304</link>
    <description>Since 2002, holiday items, can&#39;t be traded, why can&#39;t they make them some of them tradable, like the good days, waiting for them to become rare, The items now are just junky, like an untradeable easter egg, what&#39;s the point in that??

Of Course, it would take sometime for them to become rare, but that&#39;s the whole point in it.

Lets have some opinions.</description>

              <p>You could dupe in classic and no it did not destroy the economy. In Classic when the items were duped it just dropped the price of 1 item Which is the purple party hat now.</p>
<p>What destroy the economy was the fact that there was so much inflation. Santas went from 200k to 5m in 2 weeks after I started playing. Jagex relised they were putting money into the game but they had no way of taking it out. So that means more people have more money which means the money is worth less. Look at the US economy and compare lol</p>

It would be cool to sell them for 20m . get rich ^^ . but unfortunately it’s not going to happen. And read the holiday items guide or where ever it is on the runecape website. And they made them non tradeable because some pussys were wining that they didnt get any drops because some people just were being greedy (supposely jagex says) and getting to many.</p>

              <p>Because too many people complained… and they can’t just add a “new” rare… The point of a rare is something unique and not many people have… if you all of a sudden add a new item, people know it will be “rare” in the future, and noone would sell it… etc.</p>

              <p>Since 2002, holiday items, can’t be traded, why can’t they make them some of them tradable, like the good days, waiting for them to become rare, The items now are just junky, like an untradeable easter egg, what’s the point in that??</p>
<p>Of Course, it would take sometime for them to become rare, but that’s the whole point in it.</p>
<p>Lets have some opinions.</p>
