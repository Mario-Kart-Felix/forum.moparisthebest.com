    <title>10 push ups</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/10-push-ups/390589</link>
    <description>I posted this on moparisthebest, figured it couldn&#39;t hurt to have it here too.

Well, I visit a parkour website pretty frequently, and they have a &quot;10 pushup per post&quot; challenge.  Granted, that forum is full of more physically fit people, I figure it couldn&#39;t hurt to try to start it up here.  What this challenge entails is doing 10 pushups for every post you make.  Of course just pumping out a ton of pushups isn&#39;t really going to help anything, and the body will actually end up adapting to it and it won&#39;t be effective at all, so feel free to modify it to doing some pushups one week, sit ups the next, burpees, etc etc.  The idea is just to get active.

Here&#39;s a link to a picture they put in their signature on the site:

Since moparisthebest doesn&#39;t allow images in sigs I just have a link to it in mine lol.  I plan on following this challenge the best I can.

brb 10 pushups.</description>

Airborne Training, yea, he went through 3 weeks of intense cardio and crazy jumps for his wings. (badge you’re talking about.) Sounds like he’s a 21Echo.

He got some sort of badge during that training but decided to give it to someone else. He was one of the first picked to go to a school to rank up again, but he would have to enlist again, which he isn’t too keen on doing. He wants to see what they have to offer to keep him first.</p>
<p>If I would have any advice for you, is to do everything over the top. He said that the reason they love him so much is that he just tries and exceed their expectations. For example, they have an 1 hour and a half lunch break, but he shows up 30-45 mins early. Small things like that impress your higher ranking officers.</p>

<p>There’s different special forces in the army, which is why I asked. Isn’t the Rangers a special force unit? My brother got his sapper tab about 3 months ago. I’m sure you’ll love it.

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No, Ranger’s are not considered, “Special Forces.”</p>
<blockquote>Army Rangers are Special Ops.
<p>The only Special Forces team in the United States is the Green Berets. Special Forces= Green Berets (ONLY)</p>
<p>Special Ops…AKA…Special Operation Forces include:</p>
<p>Army: Delta Force, Army Rangers</p>
<p>Navy: SEALs, SWCCs, E.O.D. (Explosive Ordnance Disposal), Navy Divers</p>
<p>Air Force: Combat Controllers, E.O.D., Para-Rescue/Combat Rescue Officers, S.E.R.E. Specialists</p>
<p>Marine: Recon</p>
<p>Special Operation Forces do exactly as the title states. Each Special Operations Group has their own function/specialty.</p>
<p>Army Rangers and Navy SEALs are very familiar as they both special in fast, effective action such as taking a landing strip and securing it while a Combat Controller would call planes in for an air strike, or to fly in more troops. SEALs are more water oriented and Rangers are more land oriented, but they both can achieve the same goals.</p>
<p>If you are asking the big difference between Rangers and the Special Forces (Green Berets); The Special Forces are Force Multipliers. They specialize in going behind enemy lines for extended periods of time forming alliances and training locals to fight for the same cause. They train &amp; sometimes supply locals for missions and help destroy the enemy from within.</p>
<p>To become a Ranger you first must enlist, then request Airborne training. All Rangers are Airborne trained and requesting this training is not necessary at this point, but it will aid in the process of becoming a Ranger. After you have completed the course, and received your “Wings”, you will need to ask your commanding officer for a recommendation into the Ranger program. Then you will begin your intensive physical, and education program which includes passing the S.E.R.E Program. (Survival, Evasion, Resistance &amp; Escape) which is taught by a S.E.R.E. Specialist (Spec Ops). This training encompasses just exactly the acronym. You will learn to Survive in any environment with minimal supplies, evade the enemy when in danger of capture, Resist torture and interrogation, and escaping from the most hostile situations. During the S.E.R.E. program you will be accompanied by many other soldiers from different branches with different specialties including Naval Pilots, Combat Controllers, etc. Soon after completion you will begin intensive weapon training, navigation courses, foreign country education, etc.</p>
<p>Now for Green Berets. 95% of Green Berets were once a Special Operation Soldier and already have received the necessary training to put them a step above a normal soldier. You will again receive a refresher course on many things previously learn and undergo even more extensive physical punishment, education, and TREMENDOUS amount of political education.</p>
<p>Just in case you are curious. The best combat force in the Military would have to be the Anti-Terrorism Special Operations Group, Delta. Many Delta members were once previously Rangers&gt;Green Berets and have now been hand picked for selection into this program. They are ONLY Anti-Terrorism unit and they are the cream of the crop as far as training, education, military tactics, politics, etc. They get the newest technology, the newest information, the most comprehensive training available. They are indeed the best, but again, they are targeting a different specialty in the military opposed to different Spec Ops.</p>
<p>In reality, there is no “Best”. They all have their purpose, they are all highly trained, very well educated, and very reliable.</p>
</blockquote><br>
Proud of your brother, that’s spectacular! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Crazy ass went through sapper school… Hahaha. xD<br>
What’s his MOS if you don’t mind me asking?

Any SFO is a Green Beret. I’m going to be an Airborne Infantryman, then when I’m 20, in two years, while I’m in the Service, I’ll be able to go into SF school, once I pass it, I’ll be able to call myself a Green Beret.<br>

Yes I do. And no I’m not.<br>
I’ve been bodybuilding for a little over a year now.<br>
I train with my recruiters and a SFO (Special Forces Operator) every now and then together, sometimes two or three, but there’s only 12 SFO’s in each unit. Meaning it’s hard for them to train with us.</p>
