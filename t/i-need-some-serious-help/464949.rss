    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-some-serious-help/464949</link>
    <description>Right, after some tedious work, I finally managed to create a new player rights.
But, now for some even harder shit, I need your help if you will please.
I need to be able to make it so that, only people with these certain rights can trade in a certain area, and also have a gfx around them in a certain area.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE can someone help me, I will do whatever for it..</description>
