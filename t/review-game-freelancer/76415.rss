    <title>REVIEW: [- GAME -]: Freelancer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/review-game-freelancer/76415</link>
    <description>Hello there,
I am here to tell you about this cool space simulation called Freelancer.

Freelancer is a role-playing and fun game. You should try it as it is one of the best of what i think. It is made by Microsoft Games and Digital Anvil. The main character is named Edison Trent but everyone calls him Trent. You can start a campaign version, mod the game and more. You can even play in multiplayer mode and meet with other people.

Now for my review, Freelancer is very good because you can go through asteroid fields. Fly in space crafts and visit different planets. This game is very easy to modify. You get to choose to be a Smuggler, Merchant, Hero or Pirate. YOU DECIDE. This is an action packed role playing space simulation, it includes radical new piloting system that even lets novices focus on combat. You can play this awesome engaging storyline or you can mod the game and pursue your own adventure. This game is one huge universe with over 3000 trade routs, over 50 factions and populated by +2000 NPC&#39;s.

Storyline mode is about a story (Of Course) of Freeport 7 being destroyed by an unknown attack made by unknown ships with unknown weapons. The unknown ships were called the Nomads and were the caretakers of an ancient civilization. Freeport 7 was a station ran by the Zoners who are neutral to all (As all Freeports are). Edison Trent and Sam Lonnigan signed a deal of 1000000 credits just when the station was attacked, and sam has been in medical ever since. After the attack, the nomads took over the Rheinland then moved onto Liberty. Trent meets up with a girl named Jun Ko&#39; Zane, she is an LSF (Liberty Security Force) commander. She asks Trent to go on missions with her partner named Micheal King. After mission 3 they all go togethor just to discover that their universe is begin ruled by the nomads. They meet a guy named Orillion and he stole a high tech ship straight out of Liberties eyes. Used it as a force to destroy the Nomads once and for all.

Multiplayer connects you to a global server, with servers from all over the world (Including servers ran by Koreans, Chinese, Croation, English, Australian, US and more). You can choose some servers and create a character to continue to play on. You can meet new friends too, talk, chat and trade. Be a team if you will and take on missions togethor or destroy the other in PvP (Player vs. Player) mode.

Freelancer is an extremely easy game to mod with the SDK. The major site for all mods and is he biggest fan site is at http://www.lancersreactor.com/, it contains forums, mods, news and fan Fiction plus more. This is the best place to go looking for help on modding and storyline tips. Three of the MAJOR Freelancer mods is the WTS-World and TNG (The Next generation) mod. With modding you can create new ships for the game, new planets, star systems and bases. There is a wide range of tools for this job.

If you&#39;re unsure whether to get the game you can read other reviews of see the ad (Found at the official website (Will be mentioned later through the review)).

[B]DOWNLOAD[/B] the Freelancer trial today by visiting http://www.microsoft.com/games/freelancer/downloads_05.aspx. Click on the download link and wollah, you&#39;re downloading. The trial version consists of only one level. You can only complete the first mission and cannot go to other systems. You can only stay in the main system and in the middle of the navigational map called New York. It is ran by Liberty.

As nearly all RPG games and others, you can find a guide from GameFAQ or any other source. On GameFAQs there are some tutorials on how to mod the game. The best tutoral for on how to complete the storyline is by JMak2000.
