    <title>[PI] How can I add walking emotes and attacks that are far away?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-how-can-i-add-walking-emotes-and-attacks-that-are-far-away/433148</link>
    <description>Hey, I&#39;m using the project insanity base and I am trying to add the avatars (Strength/Range/Mage) I have successfully added the attack, death and block emotes but where can I add the emotes for walking? 

Also, when I&#39;m fighting the avatars that use long range attacks then have to be right next to me? I&#39;m pretty new to coding so don&#39;t yell at me for being a Noob, I know I am already :) 

Also, when I attack an avatar and try to lure it behind a tree, it just walks through the tree as if it isnt there? 

If you have any answers to those questions, I would be very grateful :)</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>this is on how to add the walking</p>
<p>go to your player.java and declare this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>then, go to your combatassistant.java and search</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>and under that declare this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>then, search for</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>and under that, you can start makeing cases. Ex:</p>
<p><code>			case 18349: // rapier chaotic
			c.playerStandIndex = 12021;
			c.playerWalkIndex = 12024;
			c.playerRunIndex = 12023;
			break;</code></p>
<p>hope this helped.</p>
