    <title>Help me out please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-me-out-please/18750</link>
    <description>I have recently made a server called Nilescape.no-ip.info, but i have had a few problems. I&#39;d like to make some players mods and in the client it says they are, but when you log on they are not. I have also had problems with the intro once again it says what i want in client, but not when you log in. I think it&#39;s a problem with the compiling when i compile it says 11 errors starting Nilescape if you know whats wrong please post i would greatly appreciate it.</description>
