    <description>[center][size=12pt] FamousX The Next Generation[/size][/center]

This server is dedicated to an old server I have made and the rebirth of a different server.

*Information*

[center]This server is a server that will be recognized all around and I will need some help because I think it will be good for people to help me to make the best server ever. I believe what we can do can make us known coders all around and not just one person and not just one server. I know we can be #1 not just be called retarted people. This server will not have over loaded customs like red whips, blue bandos, wings, retarted shields color, etc.! We will have real stuff I say D claws, Vesta, etc. That is in common to RS not non common gay looking things. 

[u]Server stuff needed[/u]
[s]Real GodSword Special[/s]
[s]Real GodSword Stance[/s]
[s]Actual Veng &amp; Veng other[/s]
Fixed Mage system
Fixed Xlogg
474 Attack Interface
474 Prayer Interface
Exp Lock
ClanChat
[s]Duping items[/s]
Assualt Interface
Fixed Attack Delays
