    <title>Odd issue? [Port Forwarding]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/odd-issue-port-forwarding/463064</link>
    <description>My dad picked up a signal booster for our phones since where I live our cell phones don&#39;t pick up very good signal. Anyways, I believe this is the source of my problem. I&#39;ve never in my years of RSPS had any issues with port forwarding. So don&#39;t tell me I didn&#39;t do it right, I did. I&#39;m just looking for some possible solutions. Thanks.

Additional info: I had the server port forwarded and it was working fine until he plugged the booster in.</description>
