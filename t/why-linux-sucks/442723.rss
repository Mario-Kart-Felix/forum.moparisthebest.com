              <p>Some interesting points are raised here, in particular is the issue with package management; due to the co-existing systems of package management there is a lot of duplication this time could be invested in solving other issues. Device drivers really aren’t the fault of linux, (or I suppose they’re due to it’s lack of market share and the result of companies not wanting to write software for the platform as they will receive no money in return). Really the issue with linux on the desktop (because the problem here is the desktop it makes an excellent server platform) is the lack of support from software companies.</p>

<p>so by your logic canonical are small because your fathers factory have more workers, but when foxconn have more employers than google despite being a smaller company that’s “no shit”? and then you end it by reaffirming that canonical is small? by what fucking metric? because your first freaking post used # of employees as a metric now you’re just pulling it out your ass</p>

I would love to hear them, please do tell me more. A company is a company, a corporation is a corporation. It doesn’t matter if they manually produce products or makes software. Besides the product that they put out, there really isn’t a difference… yet still so hostile, even with the no posts, I wonder why everyone left this shithole.<br>
foxxcon started in Taiwan, so no shit they’re going to have more employees. Canonical is small.</p>

              <p>I thought it was pretty fun, true though in a way, because of the driver issues and the updates that completely revamp the system and incapability issues, they just released 12.10 ubuntu, yet I have an ubuntu partition on my laptop, there is no way I can use it, it’s awfully buggy and I’ve tried many times to fix it, but it won’t recognize a problem. This is the same for my secondary desktop as well, I refuse to move any farther than 10.04 because of it just crapping out. So right now I am in the middle of pulling data then reformatting everything.</p>
<p>Obviously though, Linux (I personally like Debian-Ubuntu types) is a superior operating system and I completely love the community that is involved with it. The fact is because it is open/free sourced software (which is great) the work force won’t be what it would be for a major company, in some ways that is good, in some ways it hinders. You don’t want distros becoming large cooperation because then it would be about marketing and user friendly software, I feel ubuntu has turned into this over the years. On the other hand, more money = work force, the more money, they more people, the easier it is to fix problems and make software.</p>

              <p>I pretty much agree with tL on businesses, in my experience with a few businesses I did/do IT work for, they generally have a proprietary program they have paid for or pay for on a yearly basis or something, that has all of their data in it and all of their employee’s are trained to work in it.  This makes it impossible to transition if there is no alternative, and even if there is, the actual transition is still hard because all of their data needs ‘converted’ and their employees re-trained.</p>
<p>One example is a Church I work for, they use this:<br>
<a href="http://www.parishdata.com/churchoffice">http://www.parishdata.com/churchoffice</a> (and a few other programs from there, all that interface with each other)<br>
I did convert their file server from Windows XP to Linux, but as far as there desktops go that is a deal breaker.  I am patiently waiting, hoping for the day they get tired of PDS, when I’ll swoop in with Linux, but that might be a long time coming.</p>
<p>The other problem I see is when businesses choose windows for their computers, microsoft is ready for a full service contract, complete with integration and communication features such as SharePoint and such, and from their leaked communication it is clear they are even willing to take a loss on this to beat out Linux.  Are there any places that provide the same level of support for Linux on the desktop?  (redhat comes to mind, but I <em>think</em> they only support servers, not desktops?)</p>
<p>I think it’s perfectly viable in business, and a better solution than windows regardless, there are just some things that can’t be overcome at the moment with some setups.  I think in the nearish future that will probably change.</p>

After all, where I work, we run Linux desktops. We are Linux people, so that’s not surprising, but surely that means it’s just the fact that most businesses have Windows people, rather than anything Linux can or can’t do?</p>
<p>To be honest, most businesses don’t even have good Windows people either, so it seems like it shouldn’t be hard to break that <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>There is a common misconception that ‘regular’ users drive adoption of such platforms. Really, it is what is usable in work and businesses what drives adoption. Of course, many are regular users, but what people use at home isn’t always a way to gain market share.</p>
<p>You are right, many regular users could get on perfectly fine with Ubuntu. Now more than ever since so many people <em>just</em> use computers for the web. For Linux to get in on business for (for employees desktops) they need those specific examples of applications, not the alternatives, because the transition process probably isn’t worth it for them, and often enough those alternatives don’t addess their needs well enough. If Linux could get in on desktop computers in businesses, then it creates a snowball effect which improves the position of the platform due to that new demand.</p>
<p>People can say they don’t need that, people are happy with Linux as it is, as a niche platform. But it’d be best for the industry, I think, if Linux was as good for all these different things so that we had a real alternative and the open nature of Linux would mean that it wouldn’t simply just a third player (or second, because if Linux did this, it’d easily take over OSX in market share) in the game, there would be an extra layer of competition hopefully driving innovation.</p>

<p>WINE is great for what it is, but you can’t expect a lot of programs to run perfect with it.  The better option is to find a linux alternative to it, and for your average computer user out there, there are plenty of very good options.  Also, Ubuntu or Kubuntu is bound to be more polished as a desktop distro than Fedora.</p>

<p>I also want to say that in the beginning they bring up that you wouldn’t want to recommend linux to people, and that it should be changed so you can recommend linux to people. I don’t think anyone should be recommending linux as an alternative to windows or mac, it’s a niche product and should be treated as such, and just because it’s a niche product it shouldn’t be treated as an underdog like it currently is by manufactures and developers.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I haven’t watched the video but I would like to comment on this at least.  I think you DO want to recommend linux to people, even MOST people, just not to everyone.  A hardcore computer gamer doesn’t want to use Linux because his games don’t run under it, perhaps a business who has been running some shitty proprietary one-off type of software wouldn’t want to run it for the same reason on the desktop.  The people I recommend it to, and sometimes even end up installing it for them, is your average computer user.  The moms, dads, aunts, uncles, grandmas, grandpas of the world.  These are the people who turn on the computer and double click something to use ‘the internet’.  Hopefully most of them are already using Firefox or chrome, in which case nothing needs to change.  If they are still using IE, chances are they also don’t know or care if that continues.  I have Linux (Kubuntu, specifically) running on all my parents computers, my mother-in-law’s laptop, and my brother-in-law’s computer (he plays xbox, not computer games).  I also installed it a few months ago on my neighbors computer, not one of them has any complaints.  They can look at craigslist, do their email, and occasionally type a document up and print it from OpenOffice (or LibreOffice now, I guess…).  This is where Linux shines, it needs no maintenance, and you don’t have to worry about spyware and keeping your crappy anti-virus up to date and paid for which just slows things down.  Also, since it requires far less resources than windows, they don’t have to buy new computers for quite a while.</p>
<p>It seems to me that most of the people who complain about ‘linux’ and ‘drivers’ and who say they have experience with this probably last tried a number of years ago.  When I first started using Linux full time around 2006, it was pretty rough.  Most things had a kink, and it was a nightmare to get almost any wireless or audio card to work.  When installing linux on a new laptop you had to put at least a few hours aside for afterwards for googling issues and finding solutions, usually hacky, to get things working right.  I haven’t had to do any of that for years, if any of you have installed Windows XP, or even Windows 7 in the past, installing Ubuntu or Kubuntu now is far easier a proposition.  When you finish, everything “just works”, no googling for a thousand programs and drives to make windows work.  You have all your hardware working, and pretty much all the software a normal user would ever need.  Linux is the way to go.</p>
