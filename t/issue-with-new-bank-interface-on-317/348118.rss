If you look at all of the &quot;New bank interface&quot; topics, you&#39;ll see all of the methods and such.
For some reason it&#39;s doing that, YES I have all of the sprites in the interface folder, as you can see, it&#39;s showing a few of them but I don&#39;t see why it&#39;s not showing all of them, and I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s showing all that extra stuff.

Thanks for anyone who can help, it&#39;s very appreciated. :)</description>
