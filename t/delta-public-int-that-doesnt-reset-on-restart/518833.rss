    <title>[Delta] Public int that doesn&#39;t reset on restart?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-public-int-that-doesnt-reset-on-restart/518833</link>
    <description>So i made this NPC that you could give some gp to (10 coins to be exact) and you would get a small reward. I did that successfully, but just for fun i thought i would make a public int that keeps track of how much money people have given to him. It works except for one problem, when i restart my server the int is reset to 0. is there a way i can stop this from happening?   :(</description>

</aside>
<p>You need to make it save the int’s number somewhere that isn’t in the java files. The reason it goes back to 0 is because when you declare an int, it’s default number is 0, unless you declare it to have a number aside from that.<br>
You know how the players files hold stuff like how much EXP they have, or the level, items in back, etc? Those are all ints. You need to make it like that, but not in a player file. Maybe a text file located in the data folder?</p>
