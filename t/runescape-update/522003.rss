    <title>Runescape update</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-update/522003</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;First among these is the expansion of the tool belt, which now has the capability to store hatchets and pickaxes all the way up to dragon level. You need no longer be without your trusty woodcutting or mining tools at any time - just right-click your best ones and select &#39;Add to tool belt&#39;.

You can add any compatible tool to the belt, regardless of whether you have the level to use it. It&#39;ll act as the highest-level tool you can use until you meet its requirements. Remember, though, that once an item&#39;s on your tool belt, you can&#39;t take it off again. Be sure you want to keep those valuable tools first!

Here&#39;s a sample of the other tweaks we&#39;ve made to RuneScape today:

Ashes from fires and bonfires now appear for the person who created the bonfire first.
TokHaar are now eligible targets when performing a Tzhaar slayer assignment for Kuradal.
Certain high-level slayer targets have been made tougher and more aggressive:
Aberrant spectres
Living Rock Caverns creatures
Mutated Jadinkos
Waterfiends
Dust devils
Brutal green dragons have been made worthy of their title!
Damage limitations against the Queen Black Dragon have been made slightly less severe, she&#39;s had her style-resistant forms rebalanced to work as intended, and hits as hard as she should.
Dragons are now vulnerable to bolts, rather than arrows.
Off-hand leaf-bladed swords can now drop form kurasks and turoths, and off-hand black weapons from a variety of sources.
The Seercull bow now has a chance to drain your target&#39;s Magic level on hit - as with its pre-EoC special attack.
Several of the newest basic abilities are now included in the rotation of the Momentum ability.
The Knockout Aura now has a more clearly defined effect - increasing hit chance on NPC targets with low life points. The amount improves depending on the aura&#39;s tier.
The Kalphite King&#39;s been rebalanced to make him more challenging. Many of his attacks and his summoned creatures are much more deadly - although it&#39;s also possible to deal more damage to him than before.
Upgrading your multicannon to either the gold or royale version increases its cannonball capacity to 60 or 90, respectively.
Grotworms - mature and ordinary - are now tougher and more effective at dealing damage.
It&#39;s now possible to toggle the Quest Journal interface icon that appears post-completion of the Combat Academy back to the Combat Academy icon.
The emotes filter will now remember which category is selected across log-in sessions.
If you die, leave a gravestone and then log out, you will now be prompted on log-in that your gravestone was on a different world. There&#39;ll also be an option to log into that world to check if your gravestone is still active. This message will appear twice per gravestone on logging in, and will appear for up to one hour after the gravestone has spawned.
You can chat to the Information Clerk in the Varrock Museum for prompts on what you can do to gain any remaining kudos.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

My favorite part of this update is the toolbelt.
The only problem I see is that someone may want to take their item out of it.</description>

<p>Not that particular update though. Ever since the release of the toolbelt the community has been going “wait, how come DG allows you to update your toolbelt, but not in Gielenor (SP?)?” It’s been an age old question that Jagex decides to finally answer to after close to a year and a half. That’s pathetic.[/quote]<br>
Jagex has a lot of projects going on with RuneScape and their other games. Don’t be surprised if content is being pushed back for a different release date. Mourning’s End Part 3 was supposed to come out this year, but because of the HTML 5 client, it has been pushed back to being released in 2014. Don’t forget, they are also working on the new skill, Divination, which is to be released this year. Some content that Jagex works on could take months at a time. For example, you know the quest, The World Wakes, it took Jagex either months or a year (forget which one was it) to make that quest. This was stated by Mod Mark in one of the BTS videos.</p>
