    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/requesting-some-help-with-my-server/72293</link>
    <description>Ok Im not gonna waste time im gonna make it short &#39;n&#39; sweet, I Need Help with my server... I recently made a Client which i loved so im not in the mood to let it go to waste :) this may sound wild but i wanna see if i can get some of the best coders to work w\me and together to make a server that will knock the others into the river of obliteration.

Looking for coders that know more than the average Coder from these forums :)

What im going to be working with the people on in my server is trying to-

Make a Diverse new unique server different from the rest.
Set up commands and ways of exping and training no other server could think of.
Full staking
No nulls
full ancients 
Good pking(challenging pking ^^)
and many more


need 2-3 coders :)
1 hoster :)

those 3-4 people will become my admins

4 or 5 people who support me the whole way through- Pmods :)


MSN Me :) and we can talk KoTF@hotmail.com</description>
