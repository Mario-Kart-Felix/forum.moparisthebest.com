Codename::World is a project of mine that I&#39;ve been dreaming of making for years. [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,657139.msg4396315.html]I posted a prototype of it ages ago.[/url] It&#39;s a freeform mesh-based voxel game and plans on making [b]everything[/b] changeable by the player. In my opinion, the biggest downfall Minecraft, Terraria, Starbound, Grand Theft Auto, etc. is the limits they impose. In fact, that&#39;s my problem with all video games. There&#39;s too much useless visual content and world objects that vary only visually, and it&#39;s hard to get immersed in a paper world. I&#39;ve spent the past few years devising a way to change all that.

[size=14pt][b][u]Things I&#39;d Love to Implement but Would be Very Challenging, so We&#39;ll See One Day[/u][/b][/size]

[ul][li]Ship building &amp; Space (flying to randomly-generated planets)[/li]
[li]Level-of-detail terrain (very complicated with dynamic marching cubes)[/li]
[li]Shrinking to travel and modify the world in a 1/16 scale[/li][/ul]



[size=14pt][b][u]Major Feature Details[/u][/b][/size]

[size=12pt][b][u]Planets &amp; Finite Generation[/u][/b][/size]
This is kind of self-explanatory, but worlds will consist of randomly generated planets. Everything inside of them will be different - how harsh the terrain is, what the terrain is made out of, how intense the skylight is (if there is a sun), the sky(light) color, the resources you can find inside of it, the type of organic life on the planet, the atmosphere and weather, and more. Until I (if I even) implement space and traveling to planets that way, you will be able to generate portals to planets and customize their &quot;ingredients&quot;. This means you feed the portal or whatever objects, it breaks the objects into their materials, it breaks down the materials into their elements, and changes the planet&#39;s properties accordingly. Such properties include the amount of organic life on the planet, the type of organic life, the amounts of specific elements, how deep the caves will be, what kinds of resources will be obtainable, etc. I believe this will be the most important to keep the game fresh and exploring fun.

[size=12pt][b][u]Devices[/u][/b][/size]
A big chunk of the fun of the game is everything will run on little devices. Your tools, creatures, and whatever you want to build to get things done automatically or use logic. In fact, I&#39;ve built a prototype of how it will work! There will be two different types of components - logic and outer-world. Logic components will do things like split an electrical signal in two, do math, etc... in the circuit. Outer-world components interact with the world outside the device. Feed signals to activate them, etc. If it&#39;s worth anything, I have quite a few credits in electrical engineering so this should make things logical and (hopefully) fun.

[size=12pt][b][u]Organic DNA-based planetary life (plants &amp; creatures)[/u][/b][/size]
One of my favorite parts of the game, plants and creatures will have their genes generated randomly, and their resulting mesh (and behavior) depends on those genes. So at a certain point in the game, you&#39;ll be able to capture an organism&#39;s DNA and modify it to clone your own. Let&#39;s look at plants and creatures individually:

[ul][li]Plants - Plants will be a part of the terrain and their mesh will be generated using sub-sampling. The materials in the mesh, how small the mesh is, and the way the mesh grows will all be determined by their genes. Obviously, plants will need specific resources to grow. Sunlight, water-type material (materials will all be randomly generated, so for clarification, read below)[/li]

[li]Creatures - Creatures will follow a specific format and won&#39;t have to be like animals/humans as we know them. They can take on any shape, as their genes will decide (similar to plants). They will have different pieces (like limbs) connects together with a specific &quot;life&quot; element. Life elements are the heart and soul of a creature, and limbs will need these connected to function. The coolest part here is damaging a creature will actually break apart the mesh, so for example, shooting an enemy will actually create a hole. Breaking apart the &quot;life&quot; element will cause the limbs to break off completely. I plan on making creatures controlled by devices, so there will be pre-defined and growing behavior for enemies that runs off of customizable devices. I&#39;d like to have damaging enemies tinker with their devices, so over time, hurting an enemy will break its logic and behavior so it will glitch out.[/li][/ul]


[size=12pt][b][u]Element-Based Materials[/u][/b][/size]
The next biggest feature is the flexibility and randomly-generated of materials. This is what everything will be made out of. There will be a pre-defined long list of elements and their behaviors, how they act when interacted with, and how they change a material&#39;s appearance. While I&#39;d love to make everything here extremely flexible here, but unfortunately, computers aren&#39;t advanced enough to make a billion different appearances. Instead, visually, elements will have traits broken down into the following: color, luminance, reflective (for fancy shaders down the road), bumpiness, hole-ness(will create spots and cavities on the texture), line-ness (will create lines on the texture), organic-ness, shading (adds a slightly random value to the color in various spots), and anything else I can come up with. I think this is flexible enough to create most materials we see in real life. Add combining elements, and materials get very interesting very quickly.

There is a whole other category for behavior as well: structure (whether or not the material flows, and how quickly), solidity, temperature, opacity (how light travels through it), and other properties related to organisms.

[size=12pt][b][u]Weather[/u][/b][/size]
This one is kind of self-explanatory, but there will be dynamic planet-based weather. Clouds will generate over time and eventually cause rain once they are thick enough. Storms and other natural disasters will stem from this as well, since any extra challenge that you can build a defense for adds so much to a game.



[size=14pt][b][u]Your and My Concerns[/u][/b][/size]
Okay, so there is a lot in the works, as you can see. You&#39;re probably thinking, &quot;That feature list is huge. There&#39;s no way you&#39;ll ever finish this!&quot; and you&#39;re right! The feature list is huge! But it&#39;s all things I&#39;ve thought out over a long period of time. There&#39;s a reason this project was put on hiatus and has officially been in the works for well over a year with not a whole lot of content to show. Plus as I mentioned in the header, I dropped out of college to work on this project. Am I foolish for doing so? You decide, but this project is basically my life-long dream and I won&#39;t be abandoning it. I love working on it day-in and day-out.

Now onto my concerns. My biggest fear is this game is too ahead of its time. It will take a [b]lot[/b] of deep thinking and optimizing, but even then, it&#39;s likely you&#39;ll need a high-end computer to run it. The texture map for materials alone will probably huge, although I&#39;m thinking I [i]might[/i] be able to cut some corners here and append the texture as necessary when materials are created, and used 16-bit colors or something. I&#39;m sure there are ways to make it work, definitely, but ways of making it work on low-end computers is unlikely. My goal to have creatures run off their own devices will be tricky as well, because this means their AI won&#39;t be programmed natively. I guess it all depends on the types of components available and how complex the circuits are. But again, this is content way down the line. Other than these things, I&#39;m happy to say we&#39;re still in the clear.

[size=18pt][b][u]How Can You Help?[/u][/b][/size]
I&#39;m glad you asked! The biggest thing you can do is [size=14pt][b][u]SHARE[/u][/b][/size] the project! Share videos, screenshots, forum posts, anything. [b]Please.[/b] I desperately need people to spread this around. [b]I will be launching a low-goal Kickstarter for this project one day, so please consider supporting me then too by donating and/or sharing.[/b] Thank you! :)

<p>From this step, it’s implementing a proper QEF solver (right now I use a set of pre-calculated points and use the one with the smallest error), mesh simplification (comes with proper QEF solving), some optimizations, editing mesh, chunk-based level of detail, and more. Everything is coming along guys, don’t worry.

              <p>Thank you very much everyone for the positive feedback. It’s very encouraging. I’ll get around to releasing wallpapers soon, but in the meantime, here’s a progress update. I don’t have anything to show because I’ve been having some real life problems, but I’ve been doing lots of researching and toying with ways to improve the performance. It’s at the point where I’m seriously considering redoing the core and water physics, maybe getting rid of colored lights, and considering what direction to take textures if the level of detail thing works out.</p>
<p>I really don’t want to start the whole world processing stage over again, but after looking at Seed of Andromeda and other voxel engines, it inspired me to re-think what’s possible. I’ve taken a lot of shortcuts to get where I am now, but they’re not paying off. Recently some of the optimizations I’ve made have made draining the ocean almost possible without lag, but without redoing water physics entirely, water doesn’t settle quick enough to prevent lag and upwards of 60K+ updates. These kinds of things need to be multi-threaded, which they aren’t, and just everything sort of needs to be cleaned up. Cache hits are pretty trash after I discovered I could profile those, and I’ve thought of ways to really save on memory that would require the core to be ripped out anyways.</p>
<p>The whole reason this is even a concern is because it’s going to inhibit gameplay. I’ve planned for fast physics and massive destruction, but unless the game runs extremely well, neither of those can be implemented and that’s going to really ruin some of the game. So, I’m considering creating a test project using cube voxels where I implement a massive world and level-of-detail and once it’s done, build it into C::W. Thanks all for the support so far and hopefully this won’t take long, and more importantly, it will pay off. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>TL;DR - I’m possibly redoing the core to allow for massive render distances, faster world loading, better water physics, and overall better performance.</p>

<p>I’ve been redoing nebulae to make them look more realistic, even sampling from an actual nebula to make them look (in my opinion) amazing. They’re still dynamic and done entirely in a shader.</p>

<p>Speaking of beta, I decided I <span class="bbcode-b">am</span> going to release a publicly<span class="bbcode-b"> free </span>playable version. It’ll be labeled E-Alpha, for engine alpha. As you may have guessed, it will just allow for building stuff, playing with water, staring at the night sky - just playing with the engine. And it’ll be an alpha, meaning you’re going to experience lag issues, maybe some minor bugs here and there, maybe the game not working for you, who knows. I don’t have multiple computers to test this on, but so far it’s worked on 2 for 2. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>And some huge news: I’ve finally got some blending grass to show. I’m also playing with warping texture coordinates to eliminate tiling. This will vary from element to element since obviously it wouldn’t work with wood and such, just maybe some rocks.</p>

              <p>Thanks a ton guys. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Speaking of beta, I decided I <span class="bbcode-b">am</span> going to release a publicly free playable version. It’ll be labeled E-Alpha, for engine alpha. As you may have guessed, it will just allow for building stuff, playing with water, staring at the night sky - just playing with the engine. And it’ll be an alpha, meaning you’re going to experience lag issues, maybe some minor bugs here and there, maybe the game not working for you, who knows. I don’t have multiple computers to test this on, but so far it’s worked on 2 for 2. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>And some huge news: I’ve finally got some blending grass to show. I’m also playing with warping texture coordinates to eliminate tiling. This will vary from element to element since obviously it wouldn’t work with wood and such, just maybe some rocks.</p>

It seems a lot of you guys aren’t clear about what the game is supposed to be, but I’m not exactly surprised. Right now, the game is at a very early stage where the engine is getting fleshed out. What you saw in the video was me saying “Look at how powerful the game is. I can take out huge chunks of the terrain and put huge amounts of water in the holes while having the light update and the framerate remain steady”. It was also showing how nice (in my opinion) how some of the things looked. Remember that the game still isn’t done. I want to add a lot of visual enhancements, like realtime shadows, deferred shading for bump mapping, volumetric clouds, ocean shorelines and more. But I’m just one guy, and keep in mind pretty much all of water and the sky was made in the last two months. This is all early stuff.<br>

True, however at this point alot of us aren’t even thinking about the engine, we’re all thinking about the game. We’re analyzing this as gamers at this point, not developers. Which is why nobody is making those comments.[/quote]Well you don’t go from not having an engine to creating gameplay overnight, so analyzing a very, very early version of the game that’s mostly just the engine as a game makes no sense. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>[quote=“Bowser jr, post:119, topic:550705”]I was thinking the exact opposite, that your engine was badly optimized and needed lots of improvement.</p>
<p>As tyb97 said, work on the game. If your game idea doesn’t work, everything you’re doing now is for nothing.[/quote]Interesting. If you want to see poor optimization go and look at the first few videos. Just because you see voxel engines that have massive view distances doesn’t mean they’re optimized better. They aren’t doing recursive light calculations, which is the number one most expensive thing. If you take that out, everything would be instant and I could implement some sort of level of detail. Of course, there might still be a delay when generating the world but that’s just from generating noise, which also has nothing to do with my engine. Light calculations are extremely optimized, as is mesh generation. The biggest bottleneck is memory read/write speeds and there is only so much cache optimizing you can do. Trust me, I’ve done all the profiling and consistently improved the code and tweaked the design to be better. It <span class="bbcode-b">always</span> comes down to having to sample the world data. Also worth noting is that a chunk only has its mesh generated and appears visible once every chunk surrounding it is loaded and has its light calculated. So while it may look like the world is loading very slowly, it’s in a sense loading 9x faster sometimes than you see.</p>
<p>There <span class="bbcode-i">could</span> be ways around the memory bottleneck, but they would require using a substantial amount of additional memory. By using memory pools, cache hits are more likely and there’s very little overhead for allocating chunks. This is all stuff I’ve considered, but I don’t want to spend days reworking the core when it ups one of the other requirements and might not even work.</p>
