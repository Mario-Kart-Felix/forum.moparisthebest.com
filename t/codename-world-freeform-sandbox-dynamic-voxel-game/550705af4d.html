Codename::World is a project of mine that I&amp;#39;ve been dreaming of making for years. I posted a prototype of it ages ago. It&amp;#39;s a freeform mesh-based voxel game and plans on maki&amp;hellip;">

        <p>[quote=“Bowser jr, post:79, topic:550705”]I really doubt you’re on the right track, I bet you would run into balancing issues and/or difficulty spikes and how fast/slow your players are progressing.  But I don’t say you shouldn’t try. I would love to see what you could do if you put the graphics part on hold and worked on the gameplay elements for some time.[/quote]As Frell mentioned, balancing is something you have to test to figure out. What may seem to work perfectly in one case might fail in another. It’ll be tough balancing but not impossible. And thank you.</p>
<p>[quote=“Bowser jr, post:81, topic:550705”]Frell: I meant in the form that the design itself prevents him from being able to balance it, without putting in “arbitrary” measures which he just criticised.</p>
<p>Diamond makes good armour in Minecraft because it is rare, not because diamond is a good armour making material. Having the diamonds close to lava lakes make mining it a bit more risky. You’ll need some direct control to make such decisions, and you can’t just throw random elements together and hope everything works OK.[/quote]You don’t throw random elements together and hope everything works. Everything <span class="bbcode-b">will</span> work. The system is designed to. It’s designed to systematically create and fuse elements that will work, similar to how they’re formed in nature. Trust me when I say the method I’ve created allows for any arbitrary elements to be used and a unique, proper world generated every time. In regards to diamond in Minecraft, each element has several physical, chemical, electrical, and (to be decided) organic properties. Whether or not an element is useful just depends on what’s naturally and player generated. And note the fusing system will have costs, liftable limits, and challenges. It won’t be a “fuse this with this and win the game” sort of thing. But as usual, thanks for the feedback.</p>
<p>[quote=“Miss Silabsoft, post:82, topic:550705”]you gotta admit minecraft would be more interesting if you could walk into a cloud of chlorine gas and die at random[/quote]There is actually going to be something similar to this, as elements have properties related to how they naturally harm players, enemies, etc. That being said, elements have resistance properties to every danger one.</p>
<p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:83, topic:550705”]I can’t really tell from your picture but I think it would be cool to have a sandbox game that DOESNT use minecraft water physics. As in a source water voxel doesn’t stay there indefinitely and supply endless water.[/quote]Water is finite, except for ocean water due to the extreme lag caused by updating it and the fact that it’s unrealistic and highly unlikely for an ocean to be drained - moreso that there exists computers to handle an ocean being drained. So you can place water in a container and fill it up, and then poke a hole and drain it. There will be a video demonstrating this soon. Also in regards to ocean water, any water created by it is finite, just not natural ocean water itself. I’d love to figure out a way to overcome this problem but it’s unlikely.</p>
<p>[quote=“Bowser jr, post:84, topic:550705”]And modded minecraft allows you that. Not that death by RNG is fun, if you die it should be your own fault.[/quote]Totally agree 100%, but it’s important to have risks and unknown challenges deep underground or in hard to reach areas, so there’s always the feeling of adventure. I’m not supporting random deaths, just challenges you won’t know you have to face when you <span class="bbcode-i">make an attempt</span> to face them and have the potential to overcome them.</p>
<p>Thank you all for the feedback. While clouds aren’t final, I’ve added some noise to them to improve their look in the meantime. Thoughts?</p>

        <p>To make this game more entertaining, will definitely need a multiplayer. I wouldn’t mind co-operative mode with a friend hunting for certain elements to reach new heights in a game. Maybe create an evolution process too, as you progress through the game, you may find other NPC’s that advise you on how to use certain elements. Have scientists in game that you can work for in order to support inventions. As well as randomly generating the world, you should randomly generate a sort of society you are spawned in. Maybe have a “Medieval Society” and as you progress through you reach a modern society. or even start on a Futuristic world, and depending on the course of actions taken, evolve the society with it?</p>

If the learning curve is too steep it turns me off.[/quote]While it’s true everyone and their grandchildren have tried to make Minecraft clones, it’s important to keep two things in mind: one, this isn’t a Minecraft clone - it’s my dream project. And two, you’re implying the video game market isn’t over-saturated with 99% copies already <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I’ve been thinking very hard about the learning curve for the game, and how helpless you feel when you, for example, dive into modded Minecraft for the first time. That’s why I’d like to make the game very simple for casual players and a younger audience, but allow full complex creativity for more technical people. This is one of those things that I’ll just have to test and get right. Thank you for the constructive criticism, it’s much appreciated!</p>

<p>If what I said made no sense forgive me.[/quote]That’s actually a <span class="bbcode-i">really</span> cool idea. It would be awesome if you could travel to different planets and each had its own civilization that you could join to, like you said, get better. Though, implementing this the right way would be extremely difficult. The simplest way is to use templates, but then you get a game like Starbound with “different” civilizations that aren’t actually different at all and the game with the most diverse content suddenly becomes repetitive. But yes, it’s definitely a great idea and would be awesome to see implemented properly.

<p>I’m not happy with the fact that I had to manually create a unique texture to add detail, but it was done in such a way that automating it <span class="bbcode-i">could</span> be possible. I just used two plugins for Paint .NET. This isn’t the exact one that’s being used because the resolution turned out to be too small but it’s very similar to what the final one looks like:</p>

<p>I have something that can produce very similar results, but due to how it samples the the colors for distortion, you only get harsh contrasting points instead. But yeah, elements are only bland because of a few reasons: <span class="hashtag">#1</span>, I spent 30 seconds making them; <span class="hashtag">#2</span>, they’re rendered only at 64x64 resolution; <span class="hashtag">#3</span>, the algorithms for generating elements aren’t final.</p>

[/quote]And that’s great and all, and will look good for some of the ‘random’ elements, but what about the not so random elements? Do you have a way to ensure the regular elements look ‘normal’?[/quote]Such as? All textures in life are random. The textures on rocks, grass, dirt, wood, concrete, plastic, carpet, drywall, glass, marble, paper, steel, asphalt, rubber… sure, you have textures like this that would be impossible to generate from noise:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.riverpebbles.org/images/flint.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>But this itself is not a <span class="bbcode-i">texture</span>. It’s a bunch of objects that all have a noisy texture. Regardless, if you read in the original post under “planned technical features”, you’ll note I listed <span class="bbcode-i">World “models” (aka spots in the terrain that require sub-sampling)</span> - aka small stones, bricks, finer details, etc. I can always have some sort of hardware tessellation and do <a href="http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch07.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">other GPU tricks</a> to make up for what randomly generated textures can’t do. Also I plan on adding bump map and specular light map generating to elements once I eventually get around to adding deferred rendering, which not only will allow hardware tessellation like I said, but also give the illusion that parts of the elements are sticking out when being lit from different angles. Due to current time constraints and <span class="bbcode-b">serious</span> additional memory requirements, this is on the back-burner until I figure out a way to optimize vertices, such as <a href="http://www.braynzarsoft.net/index.php?p=D3D11Instancing" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">instancing</a> coupled with <a href="http://alphanew.net/index.php?section=articles&amp;site=marchoptim&amp;lang=eng" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">using an index buffer</a>.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, your concerns are as great as mine. I would LOVE to just be able to use pre-made textures, non-blocking point lights, shadow mapping, level of detail rendering, texture blending, and all of these features every modern game has that makes them look great. But by doing so, you’re increasing your limits - hard. Pre-made textures is obvious and won’t work for this kind of game. Non-blocking point lights not only means liquid illumination would be difficult, but making inside structures dark with expensive ambient occlusion and then having point lights either have a limited amount or bleed through walls not only increases the GPU load, but makes the game feel less genuine and free. Shadow mapping is something I’d like to implement but don’t know how it would look when objects already cast natural shadows, and shadows would disappear when a mountain goes out of view and such. Level of detail rendering isn’t an option because the bottleneck isn’t the GPU - it’s the memory required for having to store all of the world data at full resolution because of the light calculations. Implementing level of detail mesh generation just means more CPU work for no reason (the game is memory-bound). Texture blending is something I looked into for days straight, and unfortunately, it’s <span class="bbcode-b">not going to happen</span>. It’s not possible without SERIOUS limits (like a max of 5-9 terrain textures) and expenses both on the GPU and CPU, and you all know my stance on limits.</p>
<p>So there you go. Several things we’d all love to see, but will likely not happen due to the gameplay features they eliminate and the extra resources necessary to make them happen.</p>
