So today I bought Resident Evil the Mercenaries 3D and it is freaking AWESOME! It is so intense watching a horde of zombies coming from all directions! And the online gameplay is the best! Got to wave 32 before we died :). And the graphics are amazing! They look just like PS3 graphics!

Gameplay:
The camera of the game is set behind the player, moving through real-time rendered 3D environments. Unlike most other games in the series, players will have the option of aiming from a first-person viewpoint, although the over-the-shoulder aiming from Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5 will also be available. Another feature is the ability to move while firing and reloading weapons. Gameplay is shown on the top screen of the Nintendo 3DS, while inventory management is handled on the touch screen. Players will be able to customize their characters&#39; abilities and weapons, gaining new abilities over time in addition to their own strengths and weaknesses.The game will feature alternate costumes in the game for each character to unlock.

Its kinda like cod for the perks, ranks, and unlocking stuff when you level up. So think of this game like Multiplayer cod with Nazi Zombies combined. The ability to create your own class, handle each wave of zombies, but without a mystery box, buying guns off the wall, or barriers. If anybody else has this please play this with me! lol</description>
