    <description>Hi, I&#39;m looking to start my own private server. When I started this little adventure, I thought there would only be a few different server softwares. As you all must know, I was wrong. There are hundreds. I&#39;m looking for a server source that is as close to the current version of runescape as possible, and that is easy to add new content to (Yes, I have plenty of experience with Java.) I&#39;d also like one that comes with a webclient that I can host on my VPS so that people won&#39;t need to download a client. One thing that confused is all these numbers: 718, 724, 317, 667. What do those mean? Are they version numbers or something? Thanks to anyone who can help me out or point me in the right direction!</description>

              <p>Thanks! Any idea where can I download a 667/727 server? I couldn’t find one here: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,488887.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,488887.0.html</a></p>

              <p>the numbers are revisions.<br>
a 667/667 is a 667 loading 667 lol<br>
718/723 is obviously 718 loading 723</p>
<p>the closest you will get to rs graphics is the 667/727</p>
<p>you can make a webclient yourself its easy…  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"><br>
just use jarmaker and a webhost lol</p>
<p>it will not be very easy to add things to the 667 if you’ve worked with 317’s they are a pretty big jump up the list. but just dont be a leecher, be unique.</p>
<p>i hope this helped  ;D</p>
