    <title>Background not found anywhere</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/background-not-found-anywhere/311779</link>
    <description>After getting a new client today, I can&#39;t find out where the background is. There must be 4-5+ images in their respective folders, but none of them are the same as the loading background.

I&#39;ve searched &quot;title&quot; and &quot;background&quot; in various files, and even used the Z-FileSearcher to hopefully add ease to my search, by I&#39;ve still turned up with nothing.

My guess is either the file is hidden or the client links to a url to load its background image. Either way (my guesses or no), can anyone help me change it?

Thanks.</description>

              <p>What I came up with was a titlebox directory, which when I changed it it didn’t take any effect. I’ll check again, but I don’t think I’ll find anything.</p>
<p>Plus, wouldn’t there have to be a file somewhere for it to load the background?</p>
<p>EDIT: Nope, nothin found. A search for “title” resulted in finding my titlebox again, so I copied that snippet and made one for “title” and “background”, but no luck that way.</p>
