    <title>Actionbutton?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/actionbutton/393970</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using a Delta, non-renamed client, and I&#39;m trying too find the method for when you hit a button (declared as actionbutton in server) 

I am pretty sure the packetType for actionbuttons is &#39;185&#39; (I took a look at case 185 in parseIncomingPackets method)
And I searched through the client&#39;s client class for &#39;185&#39;, but all I could find was some ints declared with 185, and 185 used in some methods, but as it&#39;s non-renamed, I&#39;m having huge trouble finding out what is what...

Any help or waypoint of how too locate this method is appreciated

EDIT: If someone gave me the method(or class) name of outgoing packets, that would give me a hand</description>
