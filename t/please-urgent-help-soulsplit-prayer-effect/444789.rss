    <title>Please urgent help! Soulsplit prayer effect</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/please-urgent-help-soulsplit-prayer-effect/444789</link>
    <description>Hi, I have been trying to deal with this problem for the past six or so hours without getting any results. The GFX and all shows up, yet the effects of soul split (which heal the player by 20% of the damage dealt) do not appear, meaning the healing effect apparently does not work when I cannot see any error within my coding.

I am asking you all desperately for help and please guide me in resolving this. Thank you!
