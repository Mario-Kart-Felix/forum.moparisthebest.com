Recent upates:

[QUOTE]Hello SlashScape!

Today we have a long list of in-game updates: 

PVP Equipment:

Pvp equipment now degrades during combat. This is necessary as combat is way too unbalanced so long as Pvp equipment does not degrade, and some players become impossible to kill.

However, unlike other half-assed runescape private servers, each piece of equipment degrades separately - just as it does in RuneScape. So, immediately after being used in combat, pieces of PVP equipment will slightly degrade and will not be tradeable. Each degraded piece will be separated in your bank. After a certain amount of hits on each piece of equipment, they will fully degrade and crumble to dust.

The price of PvP equipment in the credits shop has been updated accordingly.

Barrows Equipment

We have updated the barrows equipment to use the same degrade system as Pvp equipment, however barrows equipment (obviously) degrades much more slowly. Each partially degraded piece of barrows equipment will not be tradeable, and separated in your bank (each piece will degrade separately).

Also, the bonuses from partially-degraded barrows equipment have been fixed.

PK Points &amp; PVP Drops:

The PK points system has been totally updated, and is now totally based upon the amount of risked wealth you&#39;re carrying at the time of your kill. This is not the only factor, however, as there are many other factors to prevent item farming.

PvP equipment has also been removed from the PK shop and will now randomly be dropped after killing another player (other rare items are randomly dropped, as well). The drop rates are based upon how much risked wealth you&#39;re carrying, along with other factors (such as combat difference, the area, etc).

For example... A player with 50m risked items (yes, gold counts too) will get more PK points per kill, and a much higher chance of getting a rare PvP drop. However, items which are safe (for example, from the protect item prayer) do not count in your risked items. Also, players who are not skulled will receive little to no PK points per kill.

Have fun!
- Mod Ryan.[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]Hello SlashScape!

Colored Whips &amp; Dark Bows:

You can now get colored whips and dark bows from Pest Control! Though they are a bit expensive, their street price will outweigh the effort 

If you want to get your hands on these new colored items right away, you can get them immediately using SlashScape Credits!

Vine Whips:

Vine whips have now been added to the game, with a 80 attack requirement and a neat special attack. The non-colored version (red) is rarely dropped by abyssal demons in the Slayer Tower.

The special attack, when activated in combat, will hit your opponent 10 times (1 hit/7 seconds) as long as you stay in combat with that player and have the whip equipped. Each hit will have will have a 25% accuracy boost, but will only hit with 33% of your strength.

Also, the special attack does not stack.

If you want one of these new whips right away, head over to the SlashScape Credits Center! You can get the abyssal vine whips in 5 different colors, and the other 4 colors are ONLY available with SlashScape credits (special colored vine whips are not dropped by abyssal demons).

All of the new items are tradeable.

Glitch Fixes:
The glitch that prevented you from picking up dropped flags in cwars has been fixed.
You can no longer enter your team base in cwars while you have the flag equipped.
Clicking the team base portal in cwars has been fixed.
The glitch that deleted your item when removing your equippment with a full inventory has been fixed.


Have fun!
- Ryan.[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]Hello.

Here are some updates from today. Special thanks to @James for his help!
The glitch preventing trading of random items has been fixed.
Degradeable items are no longer tradeable.
The degrade rate of PVP and barrows equipment has been lowered so they last longer.
Charges for dragonfire shields are now seperate for each individual shield, are are not tradeable if it has charges.
Dragonfire shield charges now properly decrease when using the special attack.
The special attack for colored vine whips has been fixed.
Attack and defence has been modified to be more accurate.
Dragon claws and dragon dagger specials are now a bit more accurate.
The chance for players to get PvP equipment in the wilderness has been increased based upon risk.

Have fun!
- Ryan.[/QUOTE]</description>

<p>Honestly, I dont see your problem. After you register you just…log on. You use the same username and password as your forum account. They’re linked so what happens on your forum account (like say, a password change or a ban) will happen to your in-game account.</p>
<p>Also, there is no malicious code or anything, the guy was BSing. It’s totally safe.</p>

<p>Recent upates:</p>
<p>[QUOTE]Hello SlashScape!</p>
<p>Today we have a long list of in-game updates:</p>
<p>PVP Equipment:</p>
<p>Pvp equipment now degrades during combat. This is necessary as combat is way too unbalanced so long as Pvp equipment does not degrade, and some players become impossible to kill.</p>
<p>However, unlike other half-assed runescape private servers, each piece of equipment degrades separately - just as it does in RuneScape. So, immediately after being used in combat, pieces of PVP equipment will slightly degrade and will not be tradeable. Each degraded piece will be separated in your bank. After a certain amount of hits on each piece of equipment, they will fully degrade and crumble to dust.</p>
<p>The price of PvP equipment in the credits shop has been updated accordingly.</p>
<p>Barrows Equipment</p>
<p>We have updated the barrows equipment to use the same degrade system as Pvp equipment, however barrows equipment (obviously) degrades much more slowly. Each partially degraded piece of barrows equipment will not be tradeable, and separated in your bank (each piece will degrade separately).</p>
<p>Also, the bonuses from partially-degraded barrows equipment have been fixed.</p>
<p>PK Points &amp; PVP Drops:</p>
<p>The PK points system has been totally updated, and is now totally based upon the amount of risked wealth you’re carrying at the time of your kill. This is not the only factor, however, as there are many other factors to prevent item farming.</p>
<p>PvP equipment has also been removed from the PK shop and will now randomly be dropped after killing another player (other rare items are randomly dropped, as well). The drop rates are based upon how much risked wealth you’re carrying, along with other factors (such as combat difference, the area, etc).</p>
<p>For example… A player with 50m risked items (yes, gold counts too) will get more PK points per kill, and a much higher chance of getting a rare PvP drop. However, items which are safe (for example, from the protect item prayer) do not count in your risked items. Also, players who are not skulled will receive little to no PK points per kill.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>

<p>[QUOTE]Hello SlashScape!</p>
<p>Colored Whips &amp; Dark Bows:</p>
<p>You can now get colored whips and dark bows from Pest Control! Though they are a bit expensive, their street price will outweigh the effort</p>
<p>If you want to get your hands on these new colored items right away, you can get them immediately using SlashScape Credits!</p>
<p>Vine Whips:</p>
<p>Vine whips have now been added to the game, with a 80 attack requirement and a neat special attack. The non-colored version (red) is rarely dropped by abyssal demons in the Slayer Tower.</p>
<p>The special attack, when activated in combat, will hit your opponent 10 times (1 hit/7 seconds) as long as you stay in combat with that player and have the whip equipped. Each hit will have will have a 25% accuracy boost, but will only hit with 33% of your strength.</p>
<p>Also, the special attack does not stack.</p>
<p>If you want one of these new whips right away, head over to the SlashScape Credits Center! You can get the abyssal vine whips in 5 different colors, and the other 4 colors are ONLY available with SlashScape credits (special colored vine whips are not dropped by abyssal demons).</p>
<p>All of the new items are tradeable.</p>
<p>Glitch Fixes:<br>
The glitch that prevented you from picking up dropped flags in cwars has been fixed.<br>
You can no longer enter your team base in cwars while you have the flag equipped.<br>
Clicking the team base portal in cwars has been fixed.<br>
The glitch that deleted your item when removing your equippment with a full inventory has been fixed.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>
