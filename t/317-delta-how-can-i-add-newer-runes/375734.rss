    <title>317 (delta) - how can i add newer runes?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-delta-how-can-i-add-newer-runes/375734</link>
    <description>I have correctly added the elemental rune (one rune that can be used in place of air, water, earth, fire) and catalytic rune (can be used in place of all other non-elemental runes). Much simpler system to use imho...

Anyway, I have made them stackable, and I can make them be used in place of the normal runes for specific spells (eg for barrage, or vengeance), but is there a way I can do it globally? Like add somewhere that: 1 elemental rune = 1 air + 1 water + 1 earth + fire, and 1 catalytic rune = 1 rest (mind, body, chaos, etc etc) , basically just add something like that and they will work for every single spell instead of manually inputting them. 

I&#39;ve been trying to see by the example of astrals (also a &#39;custom&#39; rune) but that&#39;s not even listed in  magicSpells.cfg or runes.cfg so I&#39;m slightly confused.

Any help as to how I could do this please? I&#39;ve searched extensively on here (and other sites) and the only mention of these runes I&#39;ve found is the same thread I took the models from..</description>
