              <p>Ok, so you basically went into your character file, and changed the rights to 2? I have a question for you, did you compile it? And If the compiler does not work, did you set the JDK version to your own? If this does work, and that you have compiled it, make yourself administrator in another way.</p>
<p>Open up your server folder. Now do this: src &gt; palidino76 &gt; rs2 &gt; io &gt; and open Login.java. Go onto Edit in notepad, and onto Find. Put in “rights”, without quotation marks, and search it. It will be highlighted. You’ll notice that the rights variable has it on “2” already, but If you look a line above it, there will be a variable in-which the rights variable is pointing to, which is a players name. E.G:</p>
<p><code>if (p.username.equals("Owner Kate") || p.username.equals("owner kate")) {
        	p.rights = 2;</code></p>
<p>Change the username to your username, which would be for an example of your forum username:</p>
<p><code>if (p.username.equals("kickyamom50") || p.username.equals("kickyamom50")) {
        	p.rights = 2;</code></p>
<p>If you have a username with capital letters in, make sure the second part of where you change the username to your own, is all lowercase. For example:</p>
<p><code>if (p.username.equals (THIS PART &gt; ("OwNeR KaTe") || p.username.equals (AND THE SECOND &gt; ("owner kate")) {
        	p.rights = 2;</code></p>
<p>Save it, and compile. This should work, If not, add my msn: <a href="mailto:katebaby72@hotmail.com">katebaby72@hotmail.com</a>.</p>
