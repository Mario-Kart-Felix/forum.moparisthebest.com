    <description>Hey guys!

Well, I&#39;ve had this issue with my iPod for along time and the issue is my home button is jammed or something. Well, today I got on the support thing on Apple and I was going through all the shit they have you fill out. I got to this one page where it said &quot;You might not be covered.&quot; and it gave me all these options: AppleCare, Pay per call or I think my issue is covered. My question is will I be charged if it isn&#39;t? I clicked continue and it brought up &quot;Contact Option&quot; page and it gives me: Call you now, schedule a call or I&#39;ll call later. So I don&#39;t know if this will charge me or not. So please help me! I would like to find out without being in risk of having to pay anything... Lol.
