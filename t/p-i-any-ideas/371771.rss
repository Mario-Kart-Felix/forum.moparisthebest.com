    <title>[P.I] Any ideas?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/p-i-any-ideas/371771</link>
    <description>Well yeah, I&#39;m considering adding Skillcape Emotes to my server but I&#39;m really not sure if my client has the new header coded into it, I don&#39;t really like the idea of adding it all if its already in the client :\

would someone care to help? The base I&#39;m using is Optic-Pkz. I checked over the tutorial and the client has some componants, such as the Animation.cass
but i&#39;m not 100% sure.</description>
