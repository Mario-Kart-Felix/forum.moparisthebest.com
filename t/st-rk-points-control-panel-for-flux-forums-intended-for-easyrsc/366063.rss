    <title>ST*RK Points Control Panel for Flux Forums (intended for EasyRSC)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/st-rk-points-control-panel-for-flux-forums-intended-for-easyrsc/366063</link>
    <description>[b]Compatible with:[/b] EasyRSC (Only), with a FluxBB Forum
[b]Download:[/b] http://uppit.com/l0260h6z2d7y/ztools.rar
[b]Features:[/b] Highscores, Point Management, Top PKer List, Change Password, Player Search, Administration Panel. (as seen on recently ran Stork Servers)

This was originally wrote by me for the kids who became idiots and tried to infect people with script kiddie tools, and I am choosing to release it. Everything is functional and configurable from what I&#39;ve seen. You set the variables up top in the file to get it running, I also believe you need to make a few changes to the template file (IE, a points=0, variable up top). Any problems or idea&#39;s let me know. Enjoy

              <p>its stupid how people name their servers with stork in it, there was more to why people liked storkpk than just the point thing. It’s the same thing as taking RSCA source and saying “RSCAngel is back!”</p>
