<p>I feel like they’re going to bring in aliens soon… Just saying. It’s easier to create a war-storyline about fighting aliens on Earth, than making up an entire war between the countries. It’s like “Hey they invaded and want to rule the planet, fight them”. But with global warfare, it’s like “Oh they did this, we did that, fight for this, save that” etc.</p>
