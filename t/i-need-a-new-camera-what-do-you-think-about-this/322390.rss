    <title>I need a new camera....what do you think about this?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-a-new-camera-what-do-you-think-about-this/322390</link>
    <description>Ever since we got back from Jamaica, I can&#39;t find my digital camera anywhere. So, with my Christmas money I thought I would buy myself a new one. I really don&#39;t want to spend over $100 and MITB doesn&#39;t really know a lot about which ones are the best. I found this one on newegg.com and really like it

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16830111314

We also went to Best Buy and I got to see one in person and still liked it. Do you think this would be a reliable camera?</description>

              <p>Does it have shake stabilization? I find the cheap point and shoots have really slow response times (the time it takes from when you press the button to the time the picture is actually captured) which can lead to lots of  blurry pictures.</p>
