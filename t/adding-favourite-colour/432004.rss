    <title>Adding Favourite Colour</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-favourite-colour/432004</link>
    <description>Hey guys.
I am adding a means in which players to tell their favourite colour. I know this is wierd, but it is for good reason. I have been fine up to the point of saving the value of String variable faveColour. I wish to add this string to the character files so that the favourite colour of each individual player is retained when they log out and back in. I have followed the template of other variable within the character file such as the character-beard. I used this as a template to ensure that the same thing happened to the colour variable. There are no errors, the favourite colour input just doesn&#39;t save after a player logs out and back in. Could somebody please explain this. Variable faveColour is declared upon player input. Then they log out, and back in and it hasn&#39;t retained their favourite colour. The file just says &quot;character-faveColour = &quot;. No matter what I do it won&#39;t save, even though I do it the same as already existing saved variables. All help is appreciated. Thank you.</description>
