    <title>Your girlfriend was raped, what do you do?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/your-girlfriend-was-raped-what-do-you-do/458591</link>
    <description>Let&#39;s say you both was at different parties in the weekend, you had alot of fun and she got raped. She tells you she was raped, she wasn&#39;t drunk she was just having a good time, then this fat dude who she&#39;s known for a couple of years tells her he can drive her home. Once she is in the car he drives to a parklot and rape her and then drives her home. 

What would you do?

Personlly
- I wouldn&#39;t press charges against the motherfucker, i&#39;d hurt him where it hurts the most, first I&#39;d beat him up so terribly and then I would cut off his dick and pay a homeless guy to rape him over and over while I tape it, onceit&#39;s been taped I&#39;d take a few copies of the tape and send it to his house every now and then.</description>

<p>Happened to a guy I know. The girl accused him of sexually assaulting her, he lost his friends and I think possibly his job, too. And then right before the court date (to avoid lying under oath) the girl withdrew.</p>

most girls cry rape when its not. its a terrible get of jail free card American girls have been taught to use, and it really sucks for the guy because if no witnesses around everyone always takes the girls word. thats not to say that legitimate rapes don’t happen but when I hear the word party and rape i automatically assume that the girl did something stupid and is covering it up.<br>

The worst part about this is that they guy she blames has to deal with being called a rapist for the rest of his life, even if he didn’t do it. Girls take rape as a joke when they’re younger and don’t understand the consequences that come with it.[/quote]<br>
How to you detect the difference between non-rape and rape?</p>
