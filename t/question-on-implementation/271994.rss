    <title>Question on implementation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-on-implementation/271994</link>
    <description>i have a question on the way that most of these private servers are implemented on the server-side(also on the client side, but all in due time)

im merely question the use of multiple class files, is there any use to this other than splitting up files, as it occurs to me that in readability is the main reason of doing this, that maybe using a compiler would make the files far more readable by allowing you to close off functions such that all contents of a function(or in some cases subroutines), or perhaps, the reasoning is for improved performance, although i doubt it, the only way i can see this improving performance would be the individual class files being all running consecutively in the background, but even that is a bit unlikely.

if someone could tell be the reasoning for the splitting for files, it&#39;d be greatly appreciated.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: April 09, 2009, 02:01:04 pm[/size][hr]&gt;.&gt; i think this deserves a bump

purely to avoid making multiple topics you understand</description>
