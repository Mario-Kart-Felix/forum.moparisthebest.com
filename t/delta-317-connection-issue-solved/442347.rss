    <title>[Delta 317] Connection Issue [SOLVED]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-317-connection-issue-solved/442347</link>
    <description>Alright to start this. I&#39;m not stupid. I know how to host and program deltas. I just would like to see if you can figure out why it won&#39;t work for me.
I used [url=http://www.r u n e  l o c u s .com/statuschecker.html]http://www.r u n e  l o c u s .com/statuschecker.html[/url](put it together.) to see if my server is online, and it successfully connected and said it&#39;s good to go. I used [url=http://www.simpleportforwarding.com/]this[/url] to port forward and also check if it&#39;s online. And that came up positive. I also used [url=http://www.canyouseeme.org]this[/url] to check if my port was open, and it came up positive as well. I triple checked my no-ip address in my client and server to make sure there was no mistake. Now why can&#39;t I connect?

Notice I used 3, count em, different methods to make sure I port forwarded correctly and was actually visible.</description>

<p>I was able to connect with literal localhost, 127.0.0.1 I never tried using my houses IP, because it would seem silly seeing as both this computer, and every other one in my house has the same IP.</p>

<p>I guess it depends how you’re trying to connect, care to share?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I have 2 computers. One is running the server (using as a 24/7 host) and the other is my computer I use normally (What I’m using to post this). I run the server on the hoster, make sure no-ip DUC is online, check that it’s ported. then come on here get run the client and no avail.<br>
I do NOT use utorrent to open 43594, I opened it in firewall. Otherwise I never would have gotten a green light saying I ported correctly.</p>
