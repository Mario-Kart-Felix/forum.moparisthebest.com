I am [size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-b">NO LONGER</span>[/size] accepting applications. Because development won’t begin for about a week and a half, I believe it would be easier to resume applications after the new year. Therefore, for all those that have applied within the past few days (the ones I haven’t responded to), you can re-apply in January 2011.</p>
<p>My apologies, I just didn’t expect so many applications to come in in such a short amount of time.[/quote]</p>

Anything else that could be useful: I wrote 1 Framework <span class="hashtag">#317</span> (Inception), and I’m currently coding my own server which is a Project Insanity Clean up, also known as RuneUnlimited. I can code your skills which is what I prefer to do. I coded 3 Delta’s before on my account “D.Ducky911” on the old R-Locus, and was a old veteran from R-Server. Anything you need, just ask. I do not work well with others, so if you would like me to code something I prefer you let me do it my way. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/cool.png?v=5" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"></p>

Years of experience with private servers of any game (and what game, too): 6 years in all. 5 years with WoW, and 1 year with RS.<br>
How many hours a day (on average) can you dedicate to this private server?: 5-6 hours aprox.<br>

Are you able to code in HTML?: Yes<br>
Are you able to code in JavaScript?: No<br>
Other programming languages you know: C++, LUA, PHP.<br>
Are you a creative person?: I consider my self as a very creative person. I both rap and dance, so you need to creative to come up with new things every time.<br>
Anything else that could be useful: I got a handle of all commands in-game, but it would be good if we could make a list of other commands we make ;)[/quote]</p>
<p>Accepted! Again, as I told the other development team members, real development won’t be beginning for a little while now because I am quite busy this month.</p>
<p>Also, because it seems as if you have quite some talent with several programming languages, it would be awesome if you could help code the server, along with myself and TimmahPwnz. It’s up to you, but you seem well qualified for the position.</p>
