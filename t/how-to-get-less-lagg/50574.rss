    <title>How to get less lagg?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-get-less-lagg/50574</link>
    <description>i was wondering...my client starts lagging with only 5 persons online, before i had more than 20 online without any lagg. i want to know; how do i get less lagg, or what makes the lagg?  :|

what it cant be is the amount of objects/monsters added, i only deleted monsters since the population did go from 20-5. And the objects couldn&#39;t really be the problem, because i have only 8 objects added and they are not at the same place, all spreaded out over the server.

and i have another question; If i delete objects (just the default objects like fountains etc.), will there be less lagg? i would delete them with the &#39;deletethatobject&#39; void, that isn&#39;t the wrong thing to do when deleting, right?

thanx in advance  :P</description>
