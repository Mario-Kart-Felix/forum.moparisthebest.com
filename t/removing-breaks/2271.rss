              <p>ya only reason iam removing mine is it stopped logging bak in after breaks dunno if its cause my new proxy gets the error connecting alot and u have to hit retry 5 times or so…but ya i would like to try and figure out the problem with that but until then iam just gonna remove the breaks thx alot for everyones info it is greatly appreciated.i wonder how long my bots will last with the breaks off hmm lol</p>

<p>Nope but i could care less about realism. My miner will be banned anyway maybe breaks may buy me a few days maybe it wont. But it tends to not produce alot and it has problems logging back in from a break.</p>
<p>I would rather get lots of coal fast and have them ban it then little to no coal at all and have them ban it without making much of a profit. In the end it will get banned so i wanna make the most of it till then :D.</p>
<p>Thats just me though… 20k coal so far so thats 4m in a few days…i can live with that <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>i have a miner running the guild coal miner and i took off breaks, so far this week ive mined 20k+ coal. We’ll see tomorrow if im banned though. So taking them out may get you banned faster or it may not. But it will deffinatly produce alot faster.</p>
