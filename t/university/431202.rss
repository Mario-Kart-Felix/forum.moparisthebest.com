    <description>So apparently this is wrong

[code]
public abstract class Pipe {

	// attribs
	protected int numColours;
	protected boolean insulation, reinforce;
	protected String type;

	public Pipe(String type, int numColours, boolean insulation,
			boolean reinforce) {
		this.type = type;
		this.numColours = numColours;
		this.insulation = insulation;
		this.reinforce = reinforce;

	}

	public int colours() {
		return numColours;
	}

	public boolean insulation() {
		return insulation;
	}

	public boolean reinforce() {
		return reinforce;
	}

	public void setInsulation(boolean insulation) {
		this.insulation = insulation;
	}

	public void setReinforcement(boolean reinforce) {
		this.reinforce = reinforce;
	}

	public void setColours(int numColours) {
		this.numColours = numColours;
	}

	public String type() {
		return type;
	}

	public void setType(String type) {
		this.type = type;
	}

}
[/code]


Here&#39;s the class diagram:

[img]http://i.imgur.com/IMaf2.png[/img]
(CustomerPipe is instantiated by OrderLine, OrderLine is insantiated by MainFuncs, DefaultPipe is instantiated by MainFuncs, both DefaultPipe and CustomerPipe have the same superclass Pipe).

The reason I created non abstract methods in the abstract class is because I want those functions to be called by both subclasses that are created from it (DefaultPipe and CustomerPipe). They both implement the methods the same so there was no need to have abstract methods in the abstract class. I also did not want Pipe to be instantiated and that&#39;s why it&#39;s abstract.

Please let me know if this is correct, thanks.

[b]tl;dr: pasted my abstract class, according to uni it&#39;s incorrect but I&#39;m pretty sure it is.[/b]</description>

              <p>Typical case of trying too hard. From a quick look your protected variables could just as well be private, and I guess if you get this type of assignment where there is one abstract and one concrete implementation the abstract class would suffice as a rule set for future implementations of Pipe where a difference in code may occur. You could use interfaces for this though… Another thing is abstract classes allow you to pass concrete implementations around as one type which is really useful for generalizing surrounding code so it won’t have to be updated/rewritten on every change in Pipe…</p>

              <p>He’s right, you don’t need an abstract class if the concrete implementations are identical. In this case you would need just the one concrete implementation.</p>
<p>You need to practice making diagrams. The diagram you’ve provided is basically a mix between an Extended Entity-Relationship diagram and a class diagram. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Look up UML class diagram and check for aggregation/composition connectors (one has a white/unfilled diamond at one end of the connector, and the other has a black/filled diamond at the end of the connector). Those are what you should be using in a class diagram to demonstrate a Has-A or Depends-On relationship between two classes.</p>

In the specification it says an abstract class must be used. On the front page of the project he wrote “your abstract class has no abstract methods?!” and in the pipe class I wrote<br>
“// note these methods aren’t abstract because all pipes implement the methods the same way” and he commented pointing to that saying “No need of abstract class then?!”.</p>
<p>He’s also circled my protected variables at the top with a ? next to it.</p>
<p>I know my abstract class has no abstract methods, the point was to look at it in an object oriented manner. I have two pipe objects already (customerpipe and defaultpipe) I thought I’d be clever and merge the code that they both execute the same way in to a superclass “pipe”.</p>
<p>There is probably a million other ways to implement it but I thought my way worked very well with my other code…</p>
<p>Thanks for responses so far, hoping I am in the right and I can stick it to my lousy lecturers.[/quote]<br>
the subclass pipe specifications don’t differ at all?.. if so this is a really poor assignment to teach inheritance - at that point i’d encapsulate an enumeration of the type of pipe it’s supposed to be:</p>
<p>class Pipe encapsulates PipeType</p>
<p>enum PipeType contains DICK_PIPE, ASS_PIPE</p>
