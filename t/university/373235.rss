    <description>I usually do not attempt to put myself over this side of the site but I would appreciate some input from people with a higher intellect than the stereotypical idiocy of the average moparscapian. Currently I am living in Australia, WA and have one more year left of school before I leave. I have been seriously considering attending uni in a different country, most likely England and am in need of advice. I get fairly good grades and my current goal is to study Psychology in a respectable university. However I am open to different career options and because I am slightly lost in what kind of occupation I want to pursue, some advice on what to study would be greatly appreciated. So where do you study, what do you study and do you really enjoy it?

              <p>Well, the most logical advice I or anyone would give is choosing whatever you’re interested in. There’s no point spending a few years doing something that you don’t like (duh). Also consider what Radeon suggested: pick universities in Australia. If you’re financially stable then obviously opt for universities in the UK or the US.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be smart if you narrowed down your list to just a few choices. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>As other people are saying, I do recommend you doing something else with a broad range of occupations that you enjoy before doing Psychology as it has a more limited range of job opportunities and suppose if you get bored of doing something related with Psych, you always have something else to fall back on.</p>

<p>Yeah i’m an Australian citizen. The cost is widely varied between each course you want to do. I know the ECU piloting course is over $80,000AUD. I still need to do some research into studying in different countries but the UK is a definite goal.</p>

<p>Are you an Australian citizen? Because if you are, it’d cost you $4000-$9000 annually at UWA depending on the course</p>
<p>Edit: If you have the money for UK/USA don’t think twice, just go for it.</p>

              <p>Well, I recommend that you reconsider your choice of studying psychology. It is interesting but if you want to get a decent job in the future it can be very limiting.</p>
<p>Australia being so massive, you could consider changing state rather than changing countries. There are some decent universities, for example Australian National University.</p>
<p>If you want to study abroad, it can be extremely difficult because it’s VERY expensive. So unless you own a Uranium mine, I don’t think it would be feasible.</p>

Currently I am living in Australia, WA and have one more year left of school before I leave. I have been seriously considering attending uni in a different country, most likely England and am in need of advice. I get fairly good grades and my current goal is to study Psychology in a respectable university. However I am open to different career options and because I am slightly lost in what kind of occupation I want to pursue, some advice on what to study would be greatly appreciated. So where do you study, what do you study and do you really enjoy it?</p>
<p>/request move to general discussion</p>
