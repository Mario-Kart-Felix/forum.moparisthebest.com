    <title>BannedScape 667 loading 718 currently in BETA</title>

    <description>For those who remembered, our BETA started July 1st, and is still currently running.

Simple server, good eco.
Things that were recently added (we have daily updates, so always something new everyday)
-Full GWD, no KC but something different and unique :) includes frozen key pieces for nex, and can combine into frozen key
-Slayer works, craftable slayer helmet + effects (going to add full slayer helmet soon)
We have a nice casket system (easy,medium,hard,&amp; elite) you will find throughout the monsters that you can fight. 

This server is nowhere near done :) but we leave it open to the public to test and to get feedback. Our goal is to create a server anyone can enjoy good eco and nice community. We have open updates and keep everyone&#39;s ideas in mind when applying new daily ones.

There is of course more content, but nothing that&#39;s surprising as of yet. 

Just some pictures, I didn&#39;t want to add a lot

Our site is currently going under renovations (titanget.com)

So this is the client download link if anyone is interested.
