    <title>Need help with client IP please? :(</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-client-ip-please/281354</link>
    <description>Well, I have been trying for a few hours now, and I usually do get it working the first time, but this time when I try changing the client IP internally,(in the GUI) it does not work, also I can not seem to find a EGUI file for some reason.. If anyone can please help me out with what to do? I can not even log on. And I have my server turned on.</description>
