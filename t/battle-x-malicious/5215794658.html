The game is 12 years but was built on a great foundation. Monsters to kill, quests to complete, it's an obvious classic and has potential but with a limited mind set, you have a limited game.
<blockquote>The private server community is dead because of server owners attempting to be head dicks of the 'community'.</blockquote>
<p>It’s always been this way. There has always been a conflict with server owners and the people who pay the price are the players. Competition is good for new innovations but is limited in the rsc scene. Do I really need to explain this?</p>

Same as above, ddossing and other malicious activity.

Looking at facebook, twitter and other social media websites you can poll in about 2,000+ potential previous players. Since most of them have played a private server before, why would they waste their time? I'll go back to head dicks of the community and blame them for this one. You can also reach out to new players who have never played before but it would be extremely difficult with your attitudes. 
<blockquote>I'd also like to add that for a new person coming into this community it's very difficult for obvious reasons.</blockquote>
The community is not friendly. 
New people don't know how the game works.
New players are discouraged when they don't understand the combat system.
Obviously everyone who has played the game before gets the drift but what private server website has actually gone out of it's way to make the scene newbie friendly? There is an obvious wall. A lot of people don't even have 7zip or rar when they stumble upon a rsc community.
<p>I won’t even bother to quote the stuff about luke since we all already know that story.</p>

<p>When RSC was actually still ran by jagex before rs2, there were sites that had malicious content, saying they were cheats for RSC, as well as people making bs bots that stole your passwords. Even with this malicious content, they still managed to have 1200 people on world 1 and at least 3 other worlds half full all day pretty much. So you can pretty much sugarcoat it however the fu<span class="bbcode-b"></span>ck you want. RSC is dead. &lt;- That’s a period aka /thread</p>

        <blockquote>The game is 12 years but was built on a great foundation. Monsters to kill, quests to complete, it's an obvious classic and has potential but with a limited mind set, you have a limited game.</blockquote>If it were an obvious classic, then there would be more demand for playing it and Jagex's attempts to restart it would have been successful.
<blockquote>    The private server community is dead because of server owners attempting to be head dicks of the 'community'.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It's always been this way. There has always been a conflict with server owners and the people who pay the price are the players. Competition is good for new innovations but is limited in the rsc scene. Do I really need to explain this?</blockquote>What do you even mean by this? What conflict by which server owners? Obviously server owners aren't going to be supporting eachother's servers, that's why it's a competition.
<blockquote>    Lothy has pointed out before, it's rather expensive to host a simple server now a days due to trolls.</blockquote>There's nothing you can do about that, it'd be a problem anywhere. It has nothing to do with why people don't play RSC, there have been plenty of servers that have been up for long periods of time.
<blockquote>Looking at facebook, twitter and other social media websites you can poll in about 2,000+ potential previous players. Since most of them have played a private server before, why would they waste their time? I'll go back to head dicks of the community and blame them for this one. You can also reach out to new players who have never played before but it would be extremely difficult with your attitudes.</blockquote>I'd love to see some stats on this instead of just random numbers you pull out of your ass. What evidence do you have that new players would invest a consistent amount of time in RSC?
<blockquote>The community is not friendly.
New people don't know how the game works.
New players are discouraged when they don't understand the combat system.</blockquote>Yes the game isn't intuitive at all and appeals to an extremely small audience. It's not a "classic" and people aren't interested in playing it because it's outdated. You can really only appeal to the nostalgia. It would take too long to try and convince and teach new players to play it if the game doesn't look appealing.
<blockquote>Obviously everyone who has played the game before gets the drift but what private server website has actually gone out of it's way to make the scene newbie friendly? There is an obvious wall. A lot of people don't even have 7zip or rar when they stumble upon a rsc community.</blockquote>PRSC was just as easy to get running as real RS. There was a simple webclient link on the front page and all you needed to do was register. I'm pretty sure this is the same case with RSCE and other private servers.
<blockquote>Even with his server he would put money on an account and sell it off like he was a gold seller. He always found a way to obtain money and in the end it resulted in his death. All the money he took from the rsc community went to his bike, so in a way.. rsc scamming caused his death.</blockquote>Do you actually have any evidence to support this or are you just relying on rumours/hearsay?

<p>When RSC was actually still ran by jagex before rs2, there were sites that had malicious content, saying they were cheats for RSC, as well as people making bs bots that stole your passwords. Even with this malicious content, they still managed to have 1200 people on world 1 and at least 3 other worlds half full all day pretty much. So you can pretty much sugarcoat it however the fu<span class="bbcode-b"></span>ck you want. RSC is dead. &lt;- That’s a period aka /thread</p>

</aside>
<p>Can you explain to me how that has anything to do with a price of a private server being extremely expensive to what it should cost? “Before” RS2 meaning the 2002-2003 era? You’re kidding… in 2002 they were managing 10,000 online at a time. In 2003 I remember 20,000+. Let’s also mention that most of those players were legitimate players.</p>

<p>Do I need to pull a list of everyone who has a ran a server and which ddossed who or which one exploited the others webpage etc etc. The only person who suffers from this is the players. I’ll put up rscangel and rsce since a lot of development got done during that battle. YES, greats thing for the rsc private server community but horrible for players.

</aside>
<p>A lot of people don’t play rsc because they know a server will be shutdown as soon as it’s too expensive to continue. I remember running a server on my home pc and holding 180 at one point. You just can’t do it anymore. With limited up time you have limited growth. Can you provide a server that has been up a long period of time and failed to tally in a good amount of players. We can discuss other reasons to why it failed.</p>

        <p>There have been some servers that were around for a while, but I’m betting they managed to acquire funding for things like DDoS protection ahead of time, before they needed it.<br>
Now that attacks seem to be a certainty, the person financing the server needs to operate out of pocket from the beginning.</p>
<p>So in short, it’s very expensive for people to operate new servers these days for public use. I suspect most servers wouldn’t generate any income through subscriptions or donations until they have been up for three to six months. That’s anywhere from $1500 to $4000 in DDoS protected hosting which has to come out of someone’s pocket.</p>
<p>To be honest, the only way running a server can be viable now is with mandatory subscription fees. If 200 players payed just $5 per month, that’d cover the cost. But I doubt there are 200 players prepared to do that.</p>

<p>lol all of you are idiots, im sure if pyru wasn’t such a kiss ass he would openly tell you also that luke did this numerous of times…</p>
<p>I can give you personal stories, Luke would tell me he was spawning sub cards, selling them for usd, buying them back for spawned gp and selling them back so there was not a lot circulating, also he created many stakers for people setting stats, selling 99 stats numerous times… told me if i wanted hed sell me 99 flats for 100 usd. this was within the first 3 months of the server…</p>
<p>All of you luke dick suckers are annoying, he was a shitty person, he thought of no1 but himself and his money, how to make more money and how to make him self look like a great guy in the process. He tried to do so much shit behind everyones back. He banned sara for corruption and demoted her etc, for the same shit he did every fuckin day… People are so fuckin dumb and naive. Pyru sells phats, and if your on his good side, you get them cheap and any color you want. even if the site says they are out of them… Mod crack has been caught selling mills by a few people and it gets swept under the rug… ex mod money unbanned mikko and got away with it, and of course it would have been seen on the mod logs but mikko came forward, or he would have got away with it…</p>
<p>I scammed vezl over 2B and pyru didn’t say shit, because he knew vezl was a piece of shit, vezl posted all over the forums that day for hours and i was sitting with over 20 hats + 5 canes, and 25 + dmed sq sets… and every other rare there was 2x of them. I know i stole 1m airs fires, and 50k deaths and 25k bloods…</p>
<p>Pyru claimed he didn’t know… lol i didn’t proxy… i checked stork-pk replicas db, saw snus password, tried it on rsce, logged on about 10 accounts and boom… Also there was no evidence of vezl botting etc.</p>
<p>He had over 5m+ total airs fires, and over 150k + deaths bloods… had over 2k rune sets, If i would of screenied the bank you would of thought he had bought lukes bike for him.</p>

        <p>Gonna go back to what I said before, Luke is no longer the owner of RSCE so why does it matter? Also, I’ve been receiving a few pms from a staff member from battle-x and after they had proven that it isn’t malicious I’ve given them the all clear to post an advertisement for it again since the only real reason the last one was removed is because the OP was supposed to be banned.</p>
<p>Gonna go ahead and lock this too since its been derailed, spammed, swallowed up by a tornado and then derailed again.</p>
