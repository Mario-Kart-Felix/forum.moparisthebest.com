    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/battle-x-malicious/521579</link>
    <description>(Sorry for the new topic but the battle-x thread is locked)

It looks like I am some kind of unofficial rsc moderator or something? After the thread advertisement got removed I got a few messages on skype and moparscape regarding the subject. I thought I would post this thread because I haven&#39;t played any private server in quite some time. If somebody did look into the client, possibly shed some light on the subject so people have a heads up.

I do know that the last time keith infected people it was a simple keylogger which he blamed one of his developers for. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hi,

I played The Djinn&#39;s (&quot;Keith&#39;s&quot;) server &quot;Battle-X&quot; for quite sometime, and I&#39;m trying to clean my comp ASAP of any malicious content due to the mod warning. What exactly were his past infringements? Is he known to put keyloggers in his clients or something, and is there knowledge of him stealing passwords/information/etc? Just curious, thanks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hey dood I played battlex and need to know about malicious files on my computer hallp.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Do private servers give viruses?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If someone could kindly pm me a dl link for the &#39;malicious client&#39; so I could look into it, that would be great...

At this time everyone should do a virus scan.</description>

              <p>Gonna go back to what I said before, Luke is no longer the owner of RSCE so why does it matter? Also, I’ve been receiving a few pms from a staff member from battle-x and after they had proven that it isn’t malicious I’ve given them the all clear to post an advertisement for it again since the only real reason the last one was removed is because the OP was supposed to be banned.</p>
<p>Gonna go ahead and lock this too since its been derailed, spammed, swallowed up by a tornado and then derailed again.</p>

<p>lol all of you are idiots, im sure if pyru wasn’t such a kiss ass he would openly tell you also that luke did this numerous of times…</p>
<p>I can give you personal stories, Luke would tell me he was spawning sub cards, selling them for usd, buying them back for spawned gp and selling them back so there was not a lot circulating, also he created many stakers for people setting stats, selling 99 stats numerous times… told me if i wanted hed sell me 99 flats for 100 usd. this was within the first 3 months of the server…</p>
<p>All of you luke dick suckers are annoying, he was a shitty person, he thought of no1 but himself and his money, how to make more money and how to make him self look like a great guy in the process. He tried to do so much shit behind everyones back. He banned sara for corruption and demoted her etc, for the same shit he did every fuckin day… People are so fuckin dumb and naive. Pyru sells phats, and if your on his good side, you get them cheap and any color you want. even if the site says they are out of them… Mod crack has been caught selling mills by a few people and it gets swept under the rug… ex mod money unbanned mikko and got away with it, and of course it would have been seen on the mod logs but mikko came forward, or he would have got away with it…</p>
<p>I scammed vezl over 2B and pyru didn’t say shit, because he knew vezl was a piece of shit, vezl posted all over the forums that day for hours and i was sitting with over 20 hats + 5 canes, and 25 + dmed sq sets… and every other rare there was 2x of them. I know i stole 1m airs fires, and 50k deaths and 25k bloods…</p>
<p>Pyru claimed he didn’t know… lol i didn’t proxy… i checked stork-pk replicas db, saw snus password, tried it on rsce, logged on about 10 accounts and boom… Also there was no evidence of vezl botting etc.</p>
<p>He had over 5m+ total airs fires, and over 150k + deaths bloods… had over 2k rune sets, If i would of screenied the bank you would of thought he had bought lukes bike for him.</p>

              <p>There have been some servers that were around for a while, but I’m betting they managed to acquire funding for things like DDoS protection ahead of time, before they needed it.<br>
Now that attacks seem to be a certainty, the person financing the server needs to operate out of pocket from the beginning.</p>
<p>So in short, it’s very expensive for people to operate new servers these days for public use. I suspect most servers wouldn’t generate any income through subscriptions or donations until they have been up for three to six months. That’s anywhere from $1500 to $4000 in DDoS protected hosting which has to come out of someone’s pocket.</p>
<p>To be honest, the only way running a server can be viable now is with mandatory subscription fees. If 200 players payed just $5 per month, that’d cover the cost. But I doubt there are 200 players prepared to do that.</p>

<blockquote>PRSC had problems before it even started. Everyone who knew two cents about the scene knew the intentions of that server. Why would we bother?

It just failed because it was sold to someone who quit not too long after he bought it. That's all there is to it.
<blockquote>The evidence was provided years ago but everyone who is in power defends rsce. Conspiracy.</blockquote>If you can't provide any evidence then I'm not going to believe you, and nobody else should either.

The online count dropped dramatically after the first few days and the interest was lost.

<p>Can you explain to me how that has anything to do with a price of a private server being extremely expensive to what it should cost? “Before” RS2 meaning the 2002-2003 era? You’re kidding… in 2002 they were managing 10,000 online at a time. In 2003 I remember 20,000+. Let’s also mention that most of those players were legitimate players.</p>

<p>Do I need to pull a list of everyone who has a ran a server and which ddossed who or which one exploited the others webpage etc etc. The only person who suffers from this is the players.

<p>A lot of people don’t play rsc because they know a server will be shutdown as soon as it’s too expensive to continue. I remember running a server on my home pc and holding 180 at one point. You just can’t do it anymore. With limited up time you have limited growth. Can you provide a server that has been up a long period of time and failed to tally in a good amount of players. We can discuss other reasons to why it failed.</p>

<p>The private server community is dead because of server owners attempting to be head dicks of the ‘community’.

<p>Ruby, everyone who knows anything about luke knows he scammed the shit out of the rsc community. Even with his server he would put money on an account and sell it off like he was a gold seller. He always found a way to obtain money and in the end it resulted in his death. All the money he took from the rsc community went to his bike, so in a way… rsc scamming caused his death.[/quote]That was the stupidest thing I’ve read from you in a while.</p>

The only reason I included that in the lock post is because of his past issues with the rat in the client etc. It might not be true this time but its better to be safe than sorry I would say!<br>

<p>So why is rscemulation left open, back in the day luke scammed 100’s of mills + a lot of other shady stuff, hacked numerous people. Seems this site plays favorites.[/quote]<br>
Completely false, you’re just picking an argument now. Luke is no longer the owner of RSCE so why should that server be removed for a past owners mistakes when this Keith directly harmed the population of this site and was banned permanently for it. You have no credible argument so just don’t post about it, simple.</p>

<p>rsc is dead because it’s 12 years old[/quote]I couldn’t have said it better myself, the only people who are still playing are people who played in their childhood looking for that nostalgic feeling and pot heads. Which of course, nothing is wrong with either of the aforementioned population.</p>
