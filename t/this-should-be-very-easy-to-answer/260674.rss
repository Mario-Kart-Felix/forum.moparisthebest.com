          <blockquote>
              <p>you click the spell and look at your run.bat. It should give you an action button case in which you’re going to put under “case 185” which is a switch statement altogether. So under case 185, you’re going to use the action button number as the case number and make an if statement that teleports you, or whatever effect you want the spell to give.</p>
