    <title>Heist - New Minigame</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/heist-new-minigame/540279</link>
    <description>New minigame that came out today that lets you use your hunter and thieving skills (not the actual skill, but sneaking around and stealing/hunting people down). Some say that it&#39;s similar the the Assassin&#39;s Creed multiplayer. I couldn&#39;t tell you that because I haven&#39;t played multiplayer on Assassin&#39;s Creed.

You can either be a guard that hunts the robbers down and put them in jail, or be the robber who sneaks around as npc&#39;s to try and loot from chests and deposit the loot into a boat/chest. The way you deposit it depends on the map you are on. There&#39;s Burthorpe night/day, Canifis, Al Kharid, and Darkmeyer. For example, if you&#39;re on Burthorpe, you have to dive into the water around the map and deposit the loot in the various boots.

There are also infected npc&#39;s in all of the maps except for Al Kharid (that I know of), and you can turn into one and spread the infection to all of the other npc&#39;s making all of the npc&#39;s infected. On  Burthorpe day/night, it&#39;s a zombie. And on Canifis, it&#39;s a werewolf. I&#39;m not what the infected is on Darkmeyer, because I haven&#39;t played on that map yet.

You earn points for perks that you can buy to help you either catch people, or help you escape the guards/jail and loot the chests. And you can also buy bonus xp in either thieving or hunter.

I find this minigame really fun and somewhat addictive.</description>

<p><span class="mention">@topic</span>- I’ve been playing for a while, honestly very fun and quite well balanced. It’s very similar to prop hunt from gmod/tf2 which is a great gamemode however they really should’ve made the guard position more enticing. Each time in the waiting lobby there is a 20:1 ratio of robbers to guards which makes the time in between games considerably longer than it should be.<br>

<p>The fact that I did that in the first 6 hours the game was release and that was before they updated the cap of points and shit. Before u tell me I’m full of shit read the updates to the game dumbass and if the games only last about 3-4mins with a good team u can get well over 200 an hour[/quote]</p>
<p>You do realise there aren’t 200 minutes in an hour, right? Even if you win every single game the win points are only rewarded after 5 minutes of game time, which if we disregard any wait time, time to get into the lobby etc it still caps out at 120 points per hour. That being said the ‘glitch’ was hotfixed within the first hour of the minigame being released which still makes your 3 million bonus xp a blatant lie.</p>
<p>If you wish to continue, you can private message me. I refuse to derail this thread more than it needs to be</p>
