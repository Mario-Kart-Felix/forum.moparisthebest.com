    <title>Joining clan chat</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/joining-clan-chat/548384</link>
    <description>Hello!
I want to add this, currently command:
[code]	if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;setcc&quot;)) {
				try {
					String[] arg = playerCommand.split(&quot; &quot;);
					String cc = arg[1];
					if (arg.length == 2) {
						c.myCC = cc;
						[/code]

To work while joining the clan chat, so players will join the same clan chat when they next time log in. 
I found this from client.java (client.side) which is the one where you type it in. 
[code]		if(j == 550) {
			inputTaken = true;
			inputDialogState = 0;
			messagePromptRaised = true;
			promptInput = &quot;&quot;;
			friendsListAction = 6;
			aString1121 = &quot;Enter the name of the chat you wish to join&quot;;
		}[/code]


Where does it handle the joining clan chat in server, and how will I add this into it?




Target: Join cc = new setcc, which is stored into player&#39;s charfile.</description>

              <p>Your server probably handles it in ClanChatHandler.java, which is typically in src&gt;server&gt;world on a PI.<br>
You probably cannot make a static reference to the methods in the class, though. So you’ll probably have to use the instance that’s found in your Server class.</p>
