    <title>Well....[562]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/well-562/429176</link>
    <description>So I am using a 562/657.

Doesn&#39;t really matter which source, they are all the same pretty much...but its mezzyscape..

I have fixed nearly all glitches in that base except for depositing a single item at a time, because I don&#39;t know whats wrong with it..

So I cannot bank any items unless I click deposit inventory.

When I click deposit on the item nothing happens.

Anybody have the code and where to put it? Please and thank you.</description>
