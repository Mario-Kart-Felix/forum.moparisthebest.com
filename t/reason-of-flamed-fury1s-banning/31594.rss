    <title>Reason of Flamed Fury1&#39;s Banning</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/reason-of-flamed-fury1s-banning/31594</link>
    <description>This is the real reason why Flamed Fury1 was IP Baned. This is Mrquarter, the person he framed. It all began:

Me, Flamed Fury1, and Guthan38 are talking on MSN. Me and Guthan38 De-obbed the Runescape Client and were cleaning it up and making it work. We got it all done and we sent it to Flamed Fury1. He said I will fix all that needs to be fixed. He really put a keylogger into it and then gave it to me. The next day, he says to me &quot;here is the client, release it on Moparscape.org but take all credit for you, don&#39;t mention my name. I am sick of everybody thinking I know everything and I want you to have credit.&quot; If you thought somebody would do that, you are mistaken. I thought it was suspicious but to get to the bottom of it, I decided to post it. I did and a day later, Moparisthebest pmed me saying that I better talk or I am IP Baned. I talked to Mopar and Flamed Fury1 was caught red-handed. He got IP Baned for it and he sort of deserves it. He keylogged everybody and deserves what he got.

That is the real story since I was involved highly. The reason I am not baned is because Flamed Fury1 came clean and told him that I had no idea it was keylogged. Thank you.

P.S. Frank_ added the keylogger, not Flamed Fury1.

P.S. If you have any other questions, please post your question/comment or pm it to me. And if you were recently hacked, please post so and I will add your name to the list. Thanks.

              <p>The real reasons for BigMac, Flamed Fury1, Frank_, and Miss Silabsoft’s bannings were because of one simple thing. This specific issue I am talking about is greed. Apparently Frank_ wanted to build ‘another’ client that connected to real RuneScape, but once again with a keylogger inside. He changed the keylogger slightly so it would save to location that he specified. He talked this over with Flammed Fury1 because fury and him has already made this client before. I am not entirely sure why Miss Silabsoft got in with it but after careful research, I mainly concluded that they may have made a client for RSC as well… BigMac was banned at the end because he fessed up and gave proof that he was in with the scandal with Silab, Frank_, and Fury1. He said they all got a totlam of about 8m <span class="bbcode-b">real</span> RS2 gold. In conclusion, this was a bunch a greedy crap that should not go on ever again. May the ones that were involved but should have known better RIP, and may this act as a reminder to all “noobs” who wish to scam people out of their har-earned money here on these forums. And for those of you who disagree with the above things I have to say ^ or just think your own theory is correct, then stop being blind and read the evidence I tracked down:</p>
<p>[quote=“sppt”]frank_ asked me to post this.</p>
<p>[code]<br>
Recently, you may be aware, I “keylogged” a run,escape deobfuscated<br>
client. There have been many, varied, stories by those involved, all of which<br>
were highly amusing. What surprised me the most, however, was the speed at<br>
which these stories changed. Don’t believe me if you want, I honestly don’t<br>
care, but I thought those of you who enjoy a read may like this.</p>
<pre><code>A week ago, on the Friday I believe, I decided I wanted to make a bot. 
</code></pre>
<p>Not just some half-arsed bot, a brilliant bot, though I wouldn’t consider<br>
making anything else. Anyway, I decided to start at something I knew every<br>
client has, RSA encryption of the login packet. I had originally planned to<br>
track the username and password variables back to the login-screen, but<br>
due to this having been my first time looking at the new engine, of course, I<br>
failed.</p>
<pre><code>Using ye-olde debugging method of System.out.print(), I eventually 
</code></pre>
<p>figured out that the username was stored as a long, and the password as a<br>
byte array. This produced the output of “1414125135:somepassword”. This<br>
output looked as though it was part of a password list, so I thought, “why<br>
not, I’ll make it log the password and encoded name”. I would hardly consider<br>
making the PHP script difficult, and making the client open the URL was<br>
beyond simple, I set up the script on my own computer. This amused me for<br>
five minutes, so I wrote a script in Perl to download and decode the list.<br>
For educational purposes, here it is.</p>

<pre><code>If you aren't an idiot, you can see how easy it was to filter out the 
</code></pre>
<p>logs created by Moparisthebest’s “SQL crasher”. Now that I had made my<br>
logger, I was deciding what to do next, do something constructive, or laugh<br>
at idiot noobs. You can guess what I finally decided to do. Being too lazy to<br>
seek out a free web host with PHP, I asked Krypton for access to his<br>
nationvoice account. Being the good, loyal friend he is, he obliged, so I<br>
uploaded my script. This was the extent of Krypton’s involvement.</p>
<pre><code>I uploaded the client to rapidshare, then sent the link to flamed_fury, 
</code></pre>
<p>claiming it to be a private client that I was developing. He was surely<br>
amazed when I told him the account details that he had used to log in.<br>
Unfortunately I didn’t keep chat logs then, so I will have to rely on my<br>
memory. I deleted his entry and we laughed it off. Eventually he asked if he<br>
could send it to some friends.</p>
<pre><code>I was reluctant at first, but thought, why not, I have never scammed 
</code></pre>
<p>before, lets have a go. I prepared a mule, walked it through the horrible<br>
bore that is tutorial island, and took it to a place that made the most sense<br>
to trade. Flamed_fury asked me if it was okay if he were to get someone to<br>
post it on <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a>, this person would take all credit for the<br>
client. I told him not to, because smart people use those forums, that it<br>
would be better to post on moparscape, because it is full of noobs.</p>
<pre><code>The distribution method had been set up, we just needed time to let the 
</code></pre>
<p>list build itself up a bit. Enter Miss Silabsoft, she was making a script for<br>
iBot that required trading and asked if I would be able to help. I accepted,<br>
sugesting that she use my account, because I had some stuff that I needed to<br>
place on that account anyway. So, all set up, she logged into my account and<br>
I proceded to go through the list of usernames and passwords. When<br>
Miss Silabsoft had gained all the data she required, we thanked each other<br>
for the help. Miss Silabsoft leaves the stage, that is all for her.</p>
<pre><code>So far I had gained an array of items that could easily be called dismal, 
</code></pre>
<p>as it was exactly that. Flamed_fury was now back online, so I logged into my<br>
mule, downloaded the latest list and sent it to him. Back to work we went,<br>
logging into each real account on the list and taking any worthwhile items.<br>
Flamed_fury must have been bragging on MSN Messenger, because I was added<br>
into a conversion involving Flamed_fury and bigmac. Bigmac wanted a piece of<br>
the action too, so I sent the list to him and told him to start at the<br>
bottom.</p>
<pre><code>After waiting for long lengths of time receiving no responses from 
</code></pre>
<p>either, I cracked up, logged off run,escape and asked both what the heck they<br>
were doing. It was highly likely that they were stealing stuff for<br>
themselves, as they had logged onto decent looking accounts and had not<br>
approached me. I gave bigmac all the cash we had gained, as flamed_fury<br>
already had a sizable amount.</p>
<pre><code>They told me that someone had discovered the scam and made a post saying 
</code></pre>
<p>so on the forums, I deleted the posts several times, and eventually locked<br>
the thread so that it would die in the abyss that is moparscape. I sent the<br>
final list to flamed_fury to do as he wanted. This is where I stopped.</p>
<pre><code>Flamed_fury and bigmac kept pestering me for updated lists, or wanted to 
</code></pre>
<p>know when I was going to make an updated client. I refused to make anything<br>
else to do with it, because I knew it was only a matter of time before<br>
moparisthebest received a private message alerting him to the thread, it<br>
would only be a matter of time before he downloaded it and text-searched for<br>
“URL”, hardly a difficult exercise, but beyond the knowledge of anyone on<br>
moparscape. This makes me wonder what would have happened if I were to have<br>
used Sockets, heh.</p>
<pre><code>So, our mighty hero, moparisthebest found out about the "scam" and 
</code></pre>
<p>contacted nationvoice. Presumably he contacted MrQuarter, the ignorant<br>
distributor, and threatened to ban him. Despite his previous claims, he<br>
squealed about Flamed_fury sending him the client. Moparisthebest then<br>
applied pressure to flamed_fury, who easily crumbled and begging not to be<br>
banned, associating various people with this event, carefully leaving out the<br>
bits that left him in strife.</p>
<pre><code>By now, moparisthebest had received the information he seeked, proving 
</code></pre>
<p>that Krypton was somehow involved. Moparisthebest was correct in this belief,<br>
but only just. Krypton, Miss Silabsoft and myself were instantly(?) banned,<br>
when we weren’t there to defend ourselves.</p>
<pre><code>For obvious reasons, moparisthebest was highly disappointed in "us", 
</code></pre>
<p>though it should have only been me. We were questioned about our involvements<br>
in the event, which must have made some sense, as flamed_fury was banned<br>
again. I gave what I had left of my password list and my mule account to<br>
moparisthebest, incase he decided to return the items that I had taken (which<br>
I hope he stored somewhere, because I destroyed my list and the paste is no<br>
longer there).</p>
<pre><code>For any of you interested in what I actually gained, it was amazingly 
</code></pre>
<p>little, approximately 1.7M gp and possibly 100K worth of items. Krypton and<br>
Miss Silabsoft gained nothing, flamed_fury and bigmac must have gained<br>
several million each.</p>
<p>I hope you feel partially enlightened, having read what really happened,<br>
and not some comical, misinformed judgment. The only person that deserves<br>
an apology is moparisthebest and I have given him that. For those of you who<br>
are haters, as before, I don’t care.</p>

<p>[quote=“bigmac”]I’m not expecting sympathy or anything i’m just explaining why i’m sorry and what has happened.</p>
<p>Some of you may know or have heard about the keylogged client that MrQauter posted… Well infact Flamed fury1 used him as a scapegoat and got him to post it. MrQaut had no idea it was keylogged. Frank_ in actual fact made this client in the first place.</p>
<p>Ok so here is the whole story…</p>
<p>Around 3-4 days ago i came home from school a bit down as my girlfriend had dumped me and i explained this to fury over msn… Then the conversation changed to RS eventually, and he explained to me that he had 5m cash, i was extremely gob smacked as the other day he only had about 500k… So carrying on, he explained how he got this cash, i was pretty amazed that he would do this but i went along with it and got sort of excited that him and Frank_ invited me to take part in this. All i thought at the time was ah great! i’m going to get lots of rs cash for nothing!<br>
The only thing i had to do to earn this cash was simply transfer money/items from the accounts they got onto frank’s level 3 which was the storage account…<br>
So throughout the night we all transfered it over to frank and i got my share and so did everyone etc.<br>
The next day i was very excited to earn more cash… but frank never spoke on msn that day.<br>
And then on the next day mopar had posted that it was a keylogger and that he would be getting MrQauter into trouble. So i thought i would stick up for fury as mopar accused him, as fury is my good friend online i thought yes why not help him. So i posted about him not having anything to do with it.<br>
Today Fury explained him, Miss Silabsoft and Frank_ were banned… But only Fury was i.p banned.</p>
<p>I feel really bad and deeply sorry for the sole fact that i took part in this <em>crime</em> please if you could all take what i’ve posted and the fact that i owned up to it into account and just think about it. I’m really sorry if i caused any hassle by helping out with this.</p>
<p>My whole profit - 300k<br>
Frank_'s profit - 2.5m<br>
Fury’s profit- 5m+<br>
Silabs profit - 300-400k</p>
<p>And as i say, i’m so sorry[/quote]</p>
<p>I did have the download for the chat between Frank_ and BigMac but I lost it. Besides, I have enough evidence above ^</p>

It’s good that Frank_ got banned he was very suspicious, He Deleted most of the good tuts. But Silab and Flamed, I never thought you would lie to the community <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>

              <p>I am right. Half of this story came from Flamed Fury1. The part about Frank_ and Miss Silbasoft came from him. He is still my friend but I can never trust him again.</p>

              <p>i think wheter you regret it or not, you should NOT! add a keylogger to any client we trusted people like flamed fury1 and they just let us down like that. I hope that flamed fury1 will not do it again on any other forum and i am sorry to say but it serves him right!</p>
<p>~rob~[br][size=1]Posted at: December 04, 2006, 07:47:14 AM[/size][hr]i did say on another post that i thought frank_ would be behind it all and if you are right mrquarter it reall does not surprise me</p>
