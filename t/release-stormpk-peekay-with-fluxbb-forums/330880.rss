<p>I just can’t see it getting popular, and if it does it will be attacked and messed with so unless you have deep pockets to pay for DDoS migration (or manage some how to get a PK server to pay for itself) I wouldn’t bother. I think people are tired of servers coming and going weekly now, people generally get a reputation for letting their server close and then people don’t ‘trust’ them into wasting time with them any more.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Me neither…yet,</p>
<p>I’ve got some experience in defending from home pc, which is where i’ve hosted all my servers on, All who attacked me were also attacking from Home PC with a simple DoS tool or just ping command<br>
There’s no big botnets around anymore, after Hixk and Tewl quit the scene, there’s only small armies of botnets, talking about less than 100.</p>
<p>And yes, I do know people are tired of new servers, which die in about a week, or less, this ‘Freetimepk’ died in less than a day.<br>
But when server gets popular, I won’t shut it down, Not untill player count is less than five all the time, which happened to PeeKay, and i believe it’s because of the immature community.</p>
<p>I’ve tried to earn some trust and reputation back here to start a new project, which is why i’ve been active on forums lately.</p>
<p>I promise this will be a successful server I’ll do everything to get it popular.</p>

<p>Full f2p Pk only would be a good Pking server, with points and a forum control panel.</p>

              <p>Hey everybody, I guess FluxBB deserves a bump, and just so you all know I will continue this project soon, It will turn into F2P server, and xEnt’s script system included, this will allow me to make more NPCs easily and faster, I’ve improved the system slightly.</p>
<p>I have a question to you people,<br>
Point system, or not?</p>

<p>As for the client ive changed the version in mudclient,gameWindowMiddleMan and server side but the clients that were released dont work, ive also changed the create socket to localhost and edited the config.java to localhost and still get the message… I think the released clients where old or edited before release… I just dont get why its saying that message… I might just rewrite the client from a standard rscd_v25 client base and see what happens…</p>

<p>Now? No, it doesn’t, from what I can tell, it died. However my original point was, it was badly programmed. You’re just using the (typical) “I didn’t spend much time doing it” excuse. My statement wasn’t up for debate and you didn’t need to justify your poorly programmed client. It was a statement, that is all.</p>

I just want to hear how you would do it, so tell me?</p>

<p>Why are you so interested in how I would do it? If I HAD to do it, it would be completely different - My own GUI (not on screen), something separate from the client.</p>

<p>I DID mean the points.</p>
<p>Then what are you asking for - You asked “how would I do it”, the only way I can possibly show you is if I show you the code, and there’s 2 reasons why I’m not going to.</p>

<p>You still dont get it, youre talking about the GUI Points to stats menu, i thought you mean the Points in client.<br>
Points: 500000<br>
get it?<br>
thats why i asked in which way would you do it.<br>

<p>You’re obviously still confused, which is why I suggest you just stop talking. The UI is HOW I would do it differently (the code used and all - Which that is what this conversation really was about; Your programming skills are bad).[/quote]<br>
Maybe crooks doesn’t have much java knowledge, but then again, he doesn’t need to.</p>
<p>I know its pretty lame to have about 150 lines just to make that point exchange screen, but it’s the easiest way, I didn’t spend much time doing it, because as long as it works, it’s fine.</p>
