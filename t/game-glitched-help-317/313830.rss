    <description> Hi i&#39;m using a deltascape source. It has buttload of glitched i would like to fix. Here they are:
 
1. When players follow they don&#39;t stand directly behind the person they are following....It gets annoying.

2. Players can walk thrugh walls when attacking an npc through a wall or following a player through a wall. JAIL DOESNT WORK IF THEY CAN DO THIS!

3. When admin/mod/owner capes get dropped, they stay in the same position as they are when they&#39;re weilded.

4. Barrage doesn&#39;t work while youre using melee, you have to stop attacking with melee, walk away, and then cast barrage(or any magic).

5. NPCS ARE FREEKED UP! Only a few npcs actauly stand in one peice. The rest, when attack or when moved, turn a bunch stick moving around.

6. All my emotes are messed up. Some of them mess up or glitch the way your player looks, others make them and move weird. I WANT WORKING SKILLCAPE EMOTES!

7. When you spec with claws, you regularly have 2 specs, but when you spec with claws on my source, the spec bar goes down to 1/4 full. BUT IT STILL HAS SPEC LEFT!

8. When players logg out it says&quot;(playername) has logged in&quot;
&quot;(Somone please help me fix these, or atleast some of them. I can&#39;t bring my server up until they&#39;re fixed.PLEASE HELP!!!!:&#39;([br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 15, 2009, 09:44:49 am[/size][hr]somone please help.....</description>
