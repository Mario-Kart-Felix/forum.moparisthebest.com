<ol>
<li>
<p>RSPS in general is dieing, people are moving away from RSPS and towards Macros like Rsbot and less and less people know about it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moparscape is usually the first community people come to, they make a account, post 3 times, THEN 4/8 of people quit, 3/8 go to another community, and a rare 1/8 stay and post actively</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The only solution i can think of is that we need to recruit more Help section mods (Not necessarily ‘mods’) because that is the main reason people quit; they can’t code so they post in the help section, then they don’t get help within the first 2 hours of posting so they quit. We could recruit about 20 users (So there are some online at some point) that will respond to the topics and not have like 2 word replys, They would reply so that the person that needs help would learn more about java while finding a solution to their problem.</p>
<p>We could also make a new section just for these ‘helpers’ to post so that the people that want GUARANTEED correct help can post there.</p>

<p>It would take up to much time to do that. Also, if they were to do that, it would end up being the Java Guru’s who are only active on MITB, so there is no point… It just takes time to answer someone’s question if the person responding to it is trying to find the tutorial, etc…</p>

<p>No… Some of the java guru’s actually couldn’t help someone in the help section a bit, it isn’t how much you know about java, it’s how much you know about how RSPS are structured.</p>

        <p>I wouldn’t go as far as to say dying, but it’s true people do rely on RS-Bot more now due to being able to pk with shit they didn’t earn and make vids to be ‘pro’.</p>

        <p>MoparScape in my opinion is the most active RSPS site out there, because it’s the site new people find.</p>
<p>As for the help section, no one has enough time to help all of the new people, because over half of them have never gotten on a computer except at school and to play RuneScape, or some other shit game, and expect to be able to jump into RSPS. This is why they’re so poorly developed, there’s so much flaming, and this forum has over 5000 pages in the help section (More than any other RSPS site).</p>
<p>Also, in case you didn’t notice, help doesn’t do shit for retards or new people. They question where to go, can never work out a problem alone, and have trouble following step-by-step instructions.</p>

<p>exactly and i found that all the other sites fail. because other sites are spoon-feeding communities.<br>
most of the mopar vet/coders on here hint you an idea and try and help you learn in the process. not just give away codes. hopefully people understand that and moparscape will not die</p>

        <p>I’ve actually thought about this a bit. With the points that you’ve made, Lin, there could be a “Help Section” moderator team. You’ve brought attention to the fact that a majority of the new members are either immature or too stubborn to try things on their own; flame, controversy, generally unnecessary BS arises, etc.; People that normally help give too short of answers or give so less of input, it’s value is nearly nothing. Overall the “Help Team” could fix all of this. As long as they have the requirements to lead newer members in the right direction, dish out punishment to those who take the section for granted, contribute to the help section in effort to aid the members it could all fit together and work out pretty nice.</p>
<p>You could say the moderators right now could do that, but their roll in the community isn’t relative to actually contributing. They’re position is for the simple fact of moderating the overall community. A little more push in the right direction could fix all of the problems referred in this thread. The only other contradiction about all of this is the fact that, us as a community, should be able to do this on our own without any specific help…</p>

<p>But you forget the big picture. We can’t do this because we can’t draw in the members that can do it, we’ll call them ‘Pros’. Why? because we have the members that we’ll call ‘Noobs’. Why do we have Noobs? they do not achieve the help that satisfies their desires. Some desire the fame that 2speced has. these are basically the only people that go from Noobs to pros. But we can’t cause we don’t.</p>

        <p>[quote=“lesterknome, post:15, topic:310648”]But you forget the big picture. We can’t do this because we can’t draw in the members that can do it, we’ll call them ‘Pros’. Why? because we have the members that we’ll call ‘Noobs’. Why do we have Noobs? they do not achieve the help that satisfies their desires. Some desire the fame that 2speced has. these are basically the only people that go from Noobs to pros. But we can’t cause we don’t.[/quote]I don’t know who 2speced is. We have a few members like that. I could name off a few, Conor (The Soul), Evan (qwertyuiop), Marc (Si Force), Myself, Jason (jc22493). All of these are candidates I’ve thought of off the top of my head (I talk to them more often than anyone else). Although they’re friends of mine, that isn’t the reason I chose them. They’re actually friends of mine because we all have something in common: We’ve learned everything from trial and error and didn’t give up if we failed. I’ve seen plenty of threads they’ve contributed to throughout their time being a part of this community. And as you’ve stated before, it’s not about how much java knowledge you know, it’s how much you know about RSPS structure. I’m sure anyone can name these members as well as many more to be nominated up there.</p>

<p>It’s funny how everyone seem’s to put their own name in there post just to achieve something that is not going to happen. And if this was to happen, then I would go with the people who actually have the time to do it, not people who come on post a little bit, then leave. I would say a few of the kid’s from Mitb would do some good work, and maybe a few from here. But with there being a lack of decent people on these forum’s it would probably go to hell with all of the arguing that goes on over stupid shit. Best thing to do is post this in the suggestions topic, or pm a Administrator.</p>
<p>Also, the reason so many people come here is because Moparscape is talked about in Rune Scape nonstop… They just Google Mopar and it pop’s up to this site… Hardly anyone talk’s about R-S or RL…</p>
