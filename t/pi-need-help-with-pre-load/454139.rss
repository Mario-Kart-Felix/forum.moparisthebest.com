    <description>Alright So i added new models (chaotic models) but there invisible so i was told to preload and it is just where you go into client.java remove the // from    [code]preloadModels();[/code]


but when i compile and load up the client i get some error untill i add the it again  [code]// preloadModels()[/code]

and my chaotic long sword is still invisble.

and when i try to do the ::add model command it doesnt work
