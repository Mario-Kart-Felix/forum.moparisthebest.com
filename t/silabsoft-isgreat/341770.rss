[i][sup]The unofficial Silabsoft server[/sup][/i]

[b]Scroll down for our new small project ZDR![/b]

[b]Update Log[/b]
[code]29.05.2010
* Dropped main project &amp; started official development on SIG
* Fixed magic bugs - Incorrect GFX if spell misses player, causes client to crash.
* Replaced prayers with headicons with text - &#39;Project from Melee; Activated.&#39; Silabsoft unfortunately doesn&#39;t support headicons.

30.05.2010
* Removed some useless files.
* Edited player saving &amp; loading.
* Fixed eating bug - wouldn&#39;t show message &#39;you just ate %%%&#39; &amp; in some cases wouldn&#39;t even show the emote.

31.05.2010
* Started work on some teleports for the server.
* Thoughts on home area. Small island? Unsure.[/code]

[font=century Gothic][b]Introduction[/b]
[b]W[/b]hen I started development, I loved silabsoft. But even it&#39;s creator dislikes it; there a barely any servers for silabsoft anymore, whenever I go to a popular server list website (http://codefasga.com, http://google.org/top.php &amp; http://moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php) every single server I read upon is either [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,297633.0.html]Deltascape[/url] poorly edited or the [b]new[/b] craze being [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,434833.msg3193245.html#msg3193245]Project Insanity[/url]. But I miss simply opening up Silabsoft&#39;s client and typing in a server address and not having to expect to spend hours training a now forgotten account so I could successfully PK, or login to a longterm server. I enjoyed logging into server to have fun. I&#39;ve found several videos on what some [i]vintage[/i] servers were;[/font]

[font=century Gothic]I can only speak for myself, but I&#39;m sure some agree with me. That&#39;s my introduction, thanks for reading this far if you did. Continue reading onward for in-depth development and media, if reading hastily just read my [b]update log[/b] on the top of my thread, every update I put there but I only will update in detail for the more important updates.

[b]Server Development[/b]
I downloaded the source &amp; edited around the look of it, before it was all in one folder. Now the [i].java[/i] files are in a [b]./src[/b] folder and compiles into a [b]./bin[/b] folder. It took a small amount of work; but it was easy to do.

My server source already has decent combat, so that is one factor that I don&#39;t have to edit and work with. I&#39;m currently working with prayer at the moment, simply editing the head icons to change them to text. That way people are notified of prayer during [b]PvP[/b]. I&#39;m currently working on a few bugs and issues that people have become aware of using this base.

[i][sup]The unofficial revival of zDiddy Reloaded.[/sup][/i]
[img]http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/703/zdr.png[/img]
[sup][b]zDiddy Reloaded working with Silabsoft. Just an object model issue preventing login.[/b][/sup]

In an attempt to try and learn more about Java, I will be reviving the lost zDiddy Reloaded source. Not many that I socialize with know about ZDR but I hope to try and get this source out there. I will be cleaning it out and hopefully adding a few things into player saving &amp; loading. ([b]There wont be anything different playing wise, everything will be the same. Same game but cleaned out and easier to run[/b])

[list]
[li][font=century Gothic]Successful login to Silabsoft client, required no skill to fix. There was an object that the client did not have within it&#39;s cache.[/font][/li]
[li][font=century Gothic]Character backups. Once downloaded and fixed the small object error ([i]above[/i]) their was a small issue with backup saving/loading. Fixed now, simply creating a folder called ./[b]charbackups[/b] and good as new.[/font][/li]
[/list][/li]
[li][font=century Gothic][u]Started[/u][/font]
[list]
[li][font=century Gothic]Slight packaging for the [b]ease[/b] of coders. (No more than several folders) This is to make it easier to scan through files to edit and look through.[/font]
[center][img]http://img217.imageshack.us/img217/696/exampled.png[/img][/center]
[/li]

[li][font=century Gothic]Character&#39;s own folders. (So technically; I&#39;ve started the new player saving &amp; loading)
[/font][/li]
[/list][/li]
[li][font=century Gothic][u]Not Started[/u][/font]
[list][li][font=century Gothic]The server saves character information in three separate locations, ./[b]characters[/b] , ./[b]morinfo[/b] &amp; ./[b]charbackups[/b] All locations serve a purpose. But this can get quite messy when you don&#39;t code it correctly or for a matter of fact, neatly. A friend of mine was implementing an idea I thought of earlier into his server. Creating a separate folder for each individual account, so instead of having to go through 3 separate folders and locating the correct [b].txt[/b] file. It will be a database of databases. The folder will be named out of the username you select &amp; within the folder will be [i]aprox.[/i] a or so dozen files. These will each hold all the information you need to edit and work with. Separate file for username, password, rights, members another for you skill level, skill experience another for your bank items another for your equipment and so on.

It might end up being the character master database withholding hundreds of folders but they will be no bigger than files today. The bytes will be divided between all the files; this means instead of going through one file and looking through it, you go to the certain file.[/font][/li]
