I erase whats in the path variable and put in: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_06\bin;     then i go to command prompt and type in &#39;javac&#39; and it works, but when i type in &#39;ipconfig&#39; it doesnt work. So then i set it back to normal and &#39;javac&#39; doesnt work but &#39;ipconfig&#39; does.
