    <title>I met someone famous!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-met-someone-famous/231562</link>
    <description>Well i went to a work do tonight... i work at a sports and social club.. which is very lucky to be one of the 100 tetleys 100 club member&#39;s throughout yorkshire.

It was called.. Tetleys 100 club big night out.. There were alot of people there...

Anyhow for the food they gave ya a half chicken (i found it alot :D) and chips or scampi and chips...

Anyhow the main show they had Jim bowen (From the 1980-1995 tv show called bullseye)

And then they had a comedian on... one of the funniest guys in the uk apparently.. forgot his name tho cause i was to intrested in jim bowen :D


Both men were very funny..

I think my favourite joke jim bowen said was ... &quot;when Bullseye first started in 1980.. it was crap.. i had people coming up to me saying Why? Anyhow.. when it finished in 1995 after being famous for 15 years.. it was still crap.. Difference being.. Im the one driving home in the bentley&quot;


And the comedian... My favourite joke for him was.. &quot;I woke up this morning.. i heard my wife scraping toast downstairs.. as i went down she said.. The only thing that can save our marriage is the missionary position... Ill assume the position and you fly off to africa&quot;


All in all.. It was a really good night for a free night out :) Free drinks.. Free food.. Free entertainment.. How goods that?</description>
