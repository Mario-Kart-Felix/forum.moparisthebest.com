              <p>Actually you have no right at all to say they have no life? My friend has played rs for 6 years and all he does is walk around because he gets bored doing the same thing. If you stuck to one thing and just trained straight on that one skill the entire time and never did anything else you would level alot faster the you think.</p>

You don’t need to no life Runescape, very very true. Anybody with half a brain can get number 1, but seeing as most of the community has the brain of a 5 year old, they don’t.</p>
