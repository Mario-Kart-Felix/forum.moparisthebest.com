              <p>I wouldn’t bother tbh, I did this for a few years and it was the most unreliable shit I’ve ever used. The webserver stack had memory leaks, the ISP router was shit and always crashed, and the connection was always dropping. The upload speed was also terrible, and the latency was huge with massive jitter.</p>
<p>You can get budget webhosting for like £30/yr and it’ll be much more reliable than hosting from home. It’s also worth thinking about the power cost… a 100W server will likely cost you around £100/yr to run.</p>

<p>There’ll be a few more things you’ll have to look into to getting the domain to point to your home server.</p>

Might help you.</p>
<p>Your bandwidth depends on your ISP, obviously.  Some ISPs frown upon running servers from home, but I’m sure you won’t attract enough volume to piss them off.</p>
