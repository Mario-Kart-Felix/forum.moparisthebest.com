    <description>Well, you have to have a taste for this kind of music to like it, but oh well.

Just thought I would post, that this is my new favorite band. I don&#39;t really like their first CD. The new one pwns though.

I would highly recommend downloading the CD quality songs rather than listening to them there, for best sound of course.

Listen to When Keeping It Real Goes Wrong, You Got A Henna Tattoo That Said Forever, and 10 Signs that you should leave.

He has awesomely deep growls/screams, and for the sake of enjoying it more, it&#39;s great to follow the lyrics.
