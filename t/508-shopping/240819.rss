    <title>[[508] Shopping?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-shopping/240819</link>
    <description>Hey, I was wondering if it&#39;s possible/how to put shops in my [508] server. If you know how/if it&#39;s even possible post here please :]

I asked this because I haven&#39;t found anything in my folders that even LOOKS like it could be some sort of shop.

Also if you told me how to edit the text on the welcome screen it would be a big help :]
