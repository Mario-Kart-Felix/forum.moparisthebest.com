    <description>I am haveing alot of trubel with just even starting the sources that i down loaded. i read that i need the jdk 6 update 2 run time invirment to run the servers and compile them, so i got it. I know that it works becuse i down loaded &quot;frugoo scape&#39;s prive server control panel&quot; that only works in jdk6. i went into the c\progam files\java\bin and found javac.java. its there... it works... but the servers wont run and they wont compile... moparscape runs fine so does runescape and frugoo scape... i keep getting the error that u getn when u have an old version of the java. could there be some other problem?</description>

              <p>i had this problem too but i got it fixed. You have to edit the .bat file that connects to the file from the “compiler” file like this</p>
<p><code>@echo off
title WhiteScape Compiler
cd C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_12\bin
javac C:\WhiteScape\*.java
pause</code></p>
<p>You have to change the Jdk “jdk1.5.0_12” version with the version that you have so if your using JDK 6 update 2 You should change it jre1.6.0_02</p>
<p>I hope I helped</p>
