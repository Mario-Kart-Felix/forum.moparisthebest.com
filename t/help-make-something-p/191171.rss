    <title>Help - Make Something (&quot;P.&quot;)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-make-something-p/191171</link>
    <description>[center][size=13pt]Welcome[/size]

[i]I&#39;m currently looking for some help. I need help to load something from another player. It&#39;s simple for some people but i find this very hard. I know that you can make something (&quot;p.&quot;) but i don&#39;t understand it. If i give someone an example here and you can post back how i would do it, i&#39;m sure i can work my way from that.[/i]

[code]p.sendMessage(&quot;Test.&quot;);[/code]

[i]What would be the void for, p.sendMessage?
Where would i add it?[/i][/center]</description>
