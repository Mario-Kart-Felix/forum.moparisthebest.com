    <description>I&#39;m looking for an application that will allow me to set audio devices on a per-program level. I found IndieVolume and the idea behind it was exactly what I wanted, however it just didn&#39;t work.

              <p>The audio system is completely different on vista/7, and IndieVolume doesn’t work with it. I’m not aware of anything like it for the new audio stuff, hence me wondering if its even possible.</p>
<p>EDIT: Well, to be a bit picky, chromium is open source, so go ahead and implement the device selection feature yourself if you wish <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>Afaik the only way you can do this is by setting one device to default, starting chrome, changing the default device, starting your other apps. The app has to implement this on windows, and chrome doesn’t. Put in a feature request in the chromium bug tracker (there already is one, actually, but add your desire to it)</p>
