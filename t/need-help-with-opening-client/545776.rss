    <title>Need help with opening client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-opening-client/545776</link>
    <description>Hello, 

I&#39;m experiencing a problem with the client, on my computer it opens up fine but when my friends download it and try to open it, it brings up a message in the cmd &quot;java not recognized&quot; and the client doesn&#39;t even open up. Now some of you are going to say, tell them to install jdk but the thing is, I can&#39;t make everyone who download my client install jdk, I used to download clients and play servers and worked with no problems when I didn&#39;t even have jdk installed. So what&#39;s wrong with my client? 

Thanks!

Also, here&#39;s what&#39;s in the bat file that opens the client:

@echo off
Title
Color 1
java -Xmx500m -cp .;Theme.jar Gui
pause

That works fine for me but not for the other people that tried my client.</description>
