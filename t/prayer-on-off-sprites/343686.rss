    <title>Prayer On &amp; Off sprites</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/prayer-on-off-sprites/343686</link>
    <description>I replaced my first four prayer sprites with curse prayers.
I coded the prayers perfectly server sided, except for one thing.
I think this is client sided, so I posted this here.

How can I change the prayer level requirement for the &#39;prayer on&#39; sprites to appear in place of the &#39;prayer off&#39; sprites?

Like at the moment, Soul Split takes the place of the &quot;Burst of Strength&quot; prayer, which shows the &#39;prayer on&#39; sprite when you reach level 4 prayer.
How can I change that number?</description>
