    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-some-quck-help-with-this-bug/249642</link>
    <description>On my server when someone logs in it will say theres 2 players online... ok then another person logs on and it says 3.. then they both log out and it still says 3?!?!? How can i make it so when they log out it doesnt keep adding them up. Because i came home from school one day and it said there were 59 players on when there was only 1. Well I would appreciate it if someone could help me out.</description>
