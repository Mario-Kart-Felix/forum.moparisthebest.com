    <title>Rest In Peace Jordan</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rest-in-peace-jordan/142023</link>
    <description>Two days ago while I was at work, my boss got a phonecall saying that Jordan Fowles had passed away in a motorbike accident.
Now the reason we got this phonecall is because Jordan worked at the same place as me. He was kind of like an older brother. At first I didn&#39;t believe this was true, untill Jordan&#39;s best friend Scott came into work crying. Jordan was a close friend to all but I was good friends with him because we worked together and I had known him from primary school.

What had happened was ever since he was 5 Jordan wanted a motorbike. Then now that he had gotten his license he was allowed to drive one. So his dad bought him one that day. He was excited about it and was driving it around town all day. He was going home on some sharp quornered roads, behind a truck. A sharp quorner came out of no where and the truck slowed down a fair ammout. Knowing he cauldn&#39;t slow down in time Jordan tried to slip past the truck. He clipped his motorbike on the truck and was thrown off onto the side of the road. He broke his neck so he wouldn&#39;t be able to walk. But he was flown to the city hospital and died there of internal bleeding.

I had never cried in public before and didn&#39;t think I would. But when the announced it on assembly (parade, aka school meeting) I cauldn&#39;t help it. All the people who where close to Jordan went to the library where you had the choice to talk to a guidence officer if you wanted. But we went there and talked about the good memories of Jordan. It was a sad day for everyone. Because he was friends with everyone and he was the kindest guy I knew. All I can say is he will be missed by all. Rest in peace Jordan.

I am not doing this for attention, I am posting this to get how I feel out. And let him be remembered maybe by more then just where he lived.
Here is a picture of him when he was on school camp, he looks a bit dorky in the second one but it&#39;s the only pictures I had of him on my computer at this time, by the way there two image of him put together:
