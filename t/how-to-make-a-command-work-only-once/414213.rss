    <title>How to make a command work only once?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-a-command-work-only-once/414213</link>
    <description>How can I make a command generate random code after they buy donator, and work only one time, like a donator command. 

EX: someone buys donator and gets a random code, then does ::code, and it give them 10 donator points. But doesn&#39;t work any more.</description>
