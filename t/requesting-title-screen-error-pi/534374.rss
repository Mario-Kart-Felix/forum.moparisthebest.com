    <description>Does anyone know how to fix the requesting title screen error on Deathlypvpz v4.1?? I have re-zipped, uploaded the cache to dropbox, copied the link, placed it in cachedownloader.java compiled with no complications or errors, I have jarred and signed it correctly about 5 times to be sure it wasn&#39;t that, changed the name in signlink.java, compiled with no errors. I already have the cache in my C:\Users\(Myusername) but when i move it to the desktop to test the autocache downloader, it gets to about 30 something percent then gives the requesting title screen error :(  :confused: :confused:

 :palm: :palm: :palm: :palm: :palm: :palm: EDIT: I cannot have been more stupid, I zipped the files incorrectly so there was a folder inside the archive containing the files..</description>
