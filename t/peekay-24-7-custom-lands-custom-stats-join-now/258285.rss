    <title>**{Peekay} (24/7) Custom Lands, Custom Stats ~~Join Now~~</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/peekay-24-7-custom-lands-custom-stats-join-now/258285</link>
    <description>[size=22pt]Ok, Peekay is now Administrated by me, due to total noob children having no hold on maintaining it[/size].

      [b]Peekay has been up for over 2 months and never had a single moments downtime, except for a few changes here and there.[/b]

       I would also like to apologize for having a terrible co-owner who couldn&#39;t even speak english properly, I know that caused alot of frustration among all of our players. I had not even thought Poor grammar would affect a server, but now I can see it really does.

       Here is the Current Staff list : {Admin x1} Me (D u b z) [Mod x1] 99flats, I am looking for VERY MATURE mods to help maintain the server. I will not just look at applications and choose from there. I will be watching everyone who has posted a application and make my best judgement to decide who will become part of our staff.

                      [font=Verdana]~~ [size=22pt]More about Peekay [/size] ~~[/font]

** Currently hosting a Vps (virtual private server) from Www.Kickassvps.com -- Have had them for the past year and they have never let me down, so I am sticking with them at the moment.

** Server is Rscd_v25, With many changes and Tweaks, Some of these include: New Stats, New Landscape, New Backgrounds, and New Items.

** 6 quests being implemented sometime this week: (heroes, lost city, vampire slayer, cooks assistant, dragon slayer, and imp catcher.

                    ~~ [size=22pt]What you can expect from Peekay[/size] ~~

** We will not be shutting down, I am not saying we will be up for [u]YEARS[/u], I am just saying that you will not be wasting your time leveling or overall just game playing.

** I do strive in meeting or responding to all requests as far as : Bans, Help, and Suggestions. I know how it feels to wait on responses from other server Administrators or Moderators.

** Great updates and overall game play.


                                    ~~ [size=22pt]About Me [/size] ~~
    
      My name is Cody, I just turned 20 on January 19th, I am from Crawfordsville, Indiana (U.S) I have only played Rsc I logged into Rs2 Beta, laughed and logged out. I had a 2 year grace period when I got locked up for multiple probation violations. When I got out I played Rsc for a little while and got very bored with lack of players and lack of overall activity. In Early 2008 I came to these forums and seen Rsc Private servers coming into affect. I had no knowledge when it came to java or even setting up a Rsc Private Server. So I posted on here and found some useful tutorials. Also thanks to Bigh51 a.k.a firewithin3, he did help me out alot and pointed me in the right direction. I had made some bad decisions pertaining to my first server Rsc-Remix and obviously found out, that  I had chose the wrong people to help me run it. Around June 2008 I turned Rsc-Remix into Rsc-Pkz due to a majority vote to make it a overall Pking server, not a skilling server. My source was released and you can find it on dayles sticky in Rsc Development.
      Since my last server I have also done the same thing to my second server. My server name was Rsc-Saints, it was a replica of Rsca but without as many updates and structure, but it did have a more complete combat system. I have now turned it into a Pking server, called Peekay (Peekay, because that was my overall favorite pking server ever made, I dont know if thats because it was one of the first I played or because the overall game experience was awesome.) This server is staying as it is, I will not be changing the format of the game anymore.

                                                        ~~ Server Details ~~

** Xp rate is around 75x
** New custom stuff, pictures show some
** New stats, dueling &amp; pking, but mine were not bought and were implemented first.
** Working Webclient
** Great Staff, Currently there is only 99flats and I but there will be more mature mods to come.

                                                  ************ More Updates ****************

 *New locations thanks to Xent,Peter, and Vrunk

   Also working on 3 mini events to work in the new landscapes, and have added a huge city in the high lvl wild for more pking and mini events. Will post pictures of that soon.

Here are the recent ones. No npcs or doors added yet, I&#39;m kinda lazy at the moment.

                                      [size=18pt]***** New Quests *****[/size]

New quest - Fight your way through MANY npcs, collecting the right items to give back to *****, he had lost them during the night, when a bunch of thieves ambushed his house and took 5 certain things, ***** says that he will pay very handsomley for his items returned, But be careful the thieves also have 4 dummy items they are willing to give you instead of ***** items. Choosing wrong will result in going back through the maze and collecting the right ones until you get it totally right.</description>

<p>We weren’t on the subject of spelling. But if i wanted to browse around the forums and find a typo you made then i could. I won’t though because it’s wasting more time then i already am replying to this.</p>
<p>And no, in the english language, it is incorrect to use the same word twice in one sentence. The same rule applies for double negatives.</p>

Choosing wrong will result in going back through the maze and collecting the right ones until you get it totally right.[/quote]You have to collect items for bitch, and bitch says you have to get his items back, then you give him bitch items?

<p>New quest - Fight your way through MANY npcs, collecting the right items to give back to *****, he had lost them during the night, when a bunch of thieves ambushed his house and took 5 certain things, ***** says that he will pay very handsomley for his items returned, But be careful the thieves also have 4 dummy items they are willing to give you instead of ***** items. Choosing wrong will result in going back through the maze and collecting the right ones until you get it totally right.</p>
