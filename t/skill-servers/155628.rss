    <description>Okay, so i&#39;m going to edit a server to make my own. But i&#39;m wondering if anybody has an idea for a good server base (well not really a server base but..), because i want ALL, FULL WORKING skills as well as many shops and stuff and the server pretty much completed for me to just edit and change things, because I just want to change stuff around instead of building a whole new server. Preferably, i don&#39;t want silabs, but meh, easily removed (I think  :|).

So, please list as many as you can and a download link or topic link (if possible).</description>
