    <title>Need help with a portal</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-a-portal/179559</link>
    <description>I need help with a portal..I don&#39;t get how to add them so I was wondering if you people can hep me? please :D
anyway what I don&#39;t get is the case #
ok for example..
I&#39;ve asked somebody and they told me &quot;The case number is usually the portal id.&quot; or something like that..
but I want to use a zamorak portal (4388) for my staff hangout.. and I&#39;ve searched
[code]case 4388:[/code]
and it appears its already being used.. 
and the other thing I don&#39;t get is how would I make it appear?
[code]AddGlobalObject(3014, 3358, 4388, 0, 10);//Staff portal[/code]
is that right? or I can&#39;t use addglobalobject or I would really appreciate it if someone can make up a code for me because this stuff really confuses me. Thanks ;D

          <blockquote>
              <p>ok first search for in client</p>
<blockquote>public void NewObjects</blockquote>
then at the end of list add
<blockquote>               makeGlobalObject(x, y, ID, #, #);//NAMEOFITEM</blockquote>
x=x cooridinate
y=y coordinate
ID=item id
#= the numbers that u want there
NAMEOFITEM=name of item
[b]in that case you would put in[/b]
<blockquote>               makeGlobalObject(3014, 3358, 4388, 0, 10);//Staff portal</blockquote>
