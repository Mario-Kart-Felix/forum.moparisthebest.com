        <p>My school has four lunch periods too. I ended up with 4th period lunch (which is my third class period since I don’t take 1st period, and is also the first lunch period), which meant my “lunch” started at 9:50 AM. I don’t even eat breakfast in the summer until ~10:30AM -_- I mean it was nice knowing I could get a lot of work for my classes later in the day done then, but cmon, it was way too early <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/confusedae52.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> Plus i was starving and had no energy for track so it sucked.</p>

        <p>We don’t have a big lunchroom. But next year we are getting a new high school next year and its costing 90 Million dollars. We’re getting  3 football fields and subway and wendy’s in there as well. Also getting a bad ass basketball court like the NBA like the thing above the logo on the court its like a scoreboard. But, There not letting us out for open lunch so it kind of sucks. We might be getting Ipad’s to rent not sure yet.</p>
<p>EDIT: There is some good classes for computers in there so I’m happy :). Going to try Graphic Design.</p>

<p>That’s tiny? I’m pretty sure my high school doesn’t have over 1000 students. (I think its less than 200 students a class sooo yeah its definitely less than 1000).</p>

        <p>My first highscool was Xaverius, ASO (highest level of highschool), the most respected and extremely hard highschool in Antwerp, did there 2 years.</p>
<p>I had a bad reputation for fights, selling fireworks etc., I was only 12 then so…<br>
On my second year on Xaverius College (this is when I got really good with computers and discovered my passion), I received a B atest (you can go to 3 but on a lower level TSO) because my French was bad (total year 40%) and that was really important in that school so I changed my highschool to the second most respected highschool in Antwerp and in my point of view harder than the first one called Sint-Gabriël. Re-did my second year because I didn’t want to go to TSO. Passed that year, but the next year…</p>
<p>I got a B again for 46% of French, we we’re planning to sue the school because my other grades we’re good and because I received that B not for French but for the 3 fights I’ve been in in those 2 years of Sint-Gabriël.</p>
<p>Then, my teacher, told me I know you’re good with computers and there’s this school you could change to that was TSO called IT-management, had advanced math and 12 hours of Hardware and Software a week. I couldn’t believe my eyes, my hobby would become my job.</p>
<p>So I went to that school, 4 TSO but not to IT-management because IT-management is only 5 and 6 and I was going to 4.</p>
<p>Basicly, I had to finish 4 wich was called Handel (“Commerce” translated by google translate) in order to get allowed in 5 IT-management.<br>
I learned a lot about economics there and how the economy works and how companies work. We got 12 hours of company management each week, hated it, but I learned a lot I didn’t know.</p>
<p>The school sucked, only 200 people, no dining room, only 30m² I think, no games to play as in football,… because the playground was too small.</p>
<p>Also, there was this guy in my class that pushed me agressively because I told him to wake up when the bell went off, he was sleeping against the wall, I pushed him back and he hit my jaw with his fist. A teacher came between before I could do anything against him and I wasn’t looking for more trouble because of my past.</p>
<p>But then, he talked shit about me on the playground the next day and telling me I was a wuss and I was the smallest in length in class, I was only 5.4, he was one of the bigger guys so he was trying to intimidate me, his friend and he called me on that day to them, I went there, his friend told me some shit about me being a wuss and stuff, I turned around and was walking away and all of a sudden he hit my shoulder when I was walking away, that was the limit, I gave him a facepalm he never had experienced before, he fell, no teacher saw that, he was intimidated, good times.</p>
<p>His friend that was lieing on the floor stood up, and I told the actual guy that he had luck that the teacher came on time, he pushed me, I challenged him to a fight, asked people to record it, he accepted the challenge, beat him up, his mom took him to the hospital and to the police, I had to make a statement to the police and shit, got away with a school contract. Basicly, because I beat him up, and because I’m Armenian, he had no sentece at all, even though he accepted the fight and lost because he was a dipshit. His jaw was swolen up, black eyes, crushed stomach, one of my better fights.</p>
<p>The fight was a week later after I got the highest rank on our Thaibox club so he had bad luck.</p>
<p>I don’t like to fight, but when people are to dumb for a verbal discussion or start yelling at me, sometimes it needs to get physique because I have a bad temper (when it’s got to do with people that aren’t friends of mine).</p>
<p>Basicly, got an A in Commerce, didn’t get any trouble after that fight happend, any this year I’m going to 5 IT-management (edit: in another school, a bigger and more evolved school) wohoooo.</p>
<p>After I finish 5 and 6, I’ll head of to 6 more years in college to become a computer engineer.</p>

        <p>[quote=“MistaBigBoss, post:27, topic:410537”]My first highscool was Xaverius, ASO (highest level of highschool), the most respected and extremely hard highschool in Antwerp, did there 2 years.</p>
<p>I had a bad reputation for fights, selling fireworks etc., I was only 12 then so…<br>
On my second year on Xaverius College (this is when I got really good with computers and discovered my passion), I received a B atest (you can go to 3 but on a lower level TSO) because my French was bad (total year 40%) and that was really important in that school so I changed my highschool to the second most respected highschool in Antwerp and in my point of view harder than the first one called Sint-Gabriël. Re-did my second year because I didn’t want to go to TSO. Passed that year, but the next year…</p>
<p>I got a B again for 46% of French, we we’re planning to sue the school because my other grades we’re good and because I received that B not for French but for the 3 fights I’ve been in in those 2 years of Sint-Gabriël.</p>
<p>Then, my teacher, told me I know you’re good with computers and there’s this school you could change to that was TSO called IT-management, had advanced math and 12 hours of Hardware and Software a week. I couldn’t believe my eyes, my hobby would become my job.</p>
<p>So I went to that school, 4 TSO but not to IT-management because IT-management is only 5 and 6 and I was going to 4.</p>
<p>Basicly, I had to finish 4 wich was called Handel (“Commerce” translated by google translate) in order to get allowed in 5 IT-management.<br>
I learned a lot about economics there and how the economy works and how companies work. We got 12 hours of company management each week, hated it, but I learned a lot I didn’t know.</p>
<p>The school sucked, only 200 people, no dining room, only 30m² I think, no games to play as in football,… because the playground was too small.</p>
<p>Also, there was this guy in my class that pushed me agressively because I told him to wake up when the bell went off, he was sleeping against the wall, I pushed him back and he hit my jaw with his fist. A teacher came between before I could do anything against him and I wasn’t looking for more trouble because of my past.</p>
<p>But then, he talked shit about me on the playground the next day and telling me I was a wuss and I was the smallest in length in class, I was only 5.4, he was one of the bigger guys so he was trying to intimidate me, his friend and he called me on that day to them, I went there, his friend told me some shit about me being a wuss and stuff, I turned around and was walking away and all of a sudden he hit my shoulder when I was walking away, that was the limit, I gave him a facepalm he never had experienced before, he fell, no teacher saw that, he was intimidated, good times.</p>
<p>His friend that was lieing on the floor stood up, and I told the actual guy that he had luck that the teacher came on time, he pushed me, I challenged him to a fight, asked people to record it, he accepted the challenge, beat him up, his mom took him to the hospital and to the police, I had to make a statement to the police and shit, got away with a school contract. Basicly, because I beat him up, and because I’m Armenian, he had no sentece at all, even though he accepted the fight and lost because he was a dipshit. His jaw was swolen up, black eyes, crushed stomach, one of my better fights.</p>
<p>The fight was a week later after I got the highest rank on our Thaibox club so he had bad luck.</p>
<p>I don’t like to fight, but when people are to dumb for a verbal discussion or start yelling at me, sometimes it needs to get physique because I have a bad temper (when it’s got to do with people that aren’t friends of mine).</p>
<p>Basicly, got an A in Commerce, didn’t get any trouble after that fight happend, any this year I’m going to 5 IT-management wohoooo.</p>
<p>After I finish 5 and 6, I’ll head of to 6 more years in college to become a computer engineer.[/quote]</p>
<p>Those schools got nothing on the American Public School system.</p>

        <p>My highschool it’s I guess, slightly large? We have a large amount of douches… I mean LARGE. A bunch of spoiled rich kids. We also have lots of cool people, though. Just not near as many. So I would say I hate about roughly 98% of the students.</p>

        <p>[quote=“MistaBigBoss, post:27, topic:410537”]My first highscool was Xaverius, ASO (highest level of highschool), the most respected and extremely hard highschool in Antwerp, did there 2 years.</p>
<p>I had a bad reputation for fights, selling fireworks etc., I was only 12 then so…<br>
On my second year on Xaverius College (this is when I got really good with computers and discovered my passion), I received a B atest (you can go to 3 but on a lower level TSO) because my French was bad (total year 40%) and that was really important in that school so I changed my highschool to the second most respected highschool in Antwerp and in my point of view harder than the first one called Sint-Gabriël. Re-did my second year because I didn’t want to go to TSO. Passed that year, but the next year…</p>
<p>I got a B again for 46% of French, we we’re planning to sue the school because my other grades we’re good and because I received that B not for French but for the 3 fights I’ve been in in those 2 years of Sint-Gabriël.</p>
<p>Then, my teacher, told me I know you’re good with computers and there’s this school you could change to that was TSO called IT-management, had advanced math and 12 hours of Hardware and Software a week. I couldn’t believe my eyes, my hobby would become my job.</p>
<p>So I went to that school, 4 TSO but not to IT-management because IT-management is only 5 and 6 and I was going to 4.</p>
<p>Basicly, I had to finish 4 wich was called Handel (“Commerce” translated by google translate) in order to get allowed in 5 IT-management.<br>
I learned a lot about economics there and how the economy works and how companies work. We got 12 hours of company management each week, hated it, but I learned a lot I didn’t know.</p>
<p>The school sucked, only 200 people, no dining room, only 30m² I think, no games to play as in football,… because the playground was too small.</p>
<p>Also, there was this guy in my class that pushed me agressively because I told him to wake up when the bell went off, he was sleeping against the wall, I pushed him back and he hit my jaw with his fist. A teacher came between before I could do anything against him and I wasn’t looking for more trouble because of my past.</p>
<p>But then, he talked shit about me on the playground the next day and telling me I was a wuss and I was the smallest in length in class, I was only 5.4, he was one of the bigger guys so he was trying to intimidate me, his friend and he called me on that day to them, I went there, his friend told me some shit about me being a wuss and stuff, I turned around and was walking away and all of a sudden he hit my shoulder when I was walking away, that was the limit, I gave him a facepalm he never had experienced before, he fell, no teacher saw that, he was intimidated, good times.</p>
<p>His friend that was lieing on the floor stood up, and I told the actual guy that he had luck that the teacher came on time, he pushed me, I challenged him to a fight, asked people to record it, he accepted the challenge, beat him up, his mom took him to the hospital and to the police, I had to make a statement to the police and shit, got away with a school contract. Basicly, because I beat him up, and because I’m Armenian, he had no sentece at all, even though he accepted the fight and lost because he was a dipshit. His jaw was swolen up, black eyes, crushed stomach, one of my better fights.</p>
<p>The fight was a week later after I got the highest rank on our Thaibox club so he had bad luck.</p>
<p>I don’t like to fight, but when people are to dumb for a verbal discussion or start yelling at me, sometimes it needs to get physique because I have a bad temper (when it’s got to do with people that aren’t friends of mine).</p>
<p>Basicly, got an A in Commerce, didn’t get any trouble after that fight happend, any this year I’m going to 5 IT-management (edit: in another school, a bigger and more evolved school) wohoooo.</p>
<p>After I finish 5 and 6, I’ll head of to 6 more years in college to become a computer engineer.[/quote]<br>
