    <title>Can&#39;t get anything right</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-get-anything-right/401737</link>
    <description>O.K. I&#39;ve been working on going for a server for a long time. I&#39;ve tried every tutoriial and always get so close to making a server work but I just can&#39;t get it to fully work. I am looking for a good and easy 317 server with pickup and to be able to have a webclient with it. If someone could Teamview me and help, I would be willing to pay up to $30 for the work done. Please respond or message if you are able to help. Thanks for reading, Tyler</description>

              <p>Do this:<br>
Search bar- hybrid Pvp</p>
<p>Download the source and the client ( not webclient )<br>
Extract both to your desktop.<br>
Make a new folder on desktop and drop the client and source you extracted into the new folder.<br>
From their just change the Ip’s, compile it ( but first you need to edit the compiling to your java ) Then run it. You can edit the shops and everything else… Just follow those tutorials…</p>
<p>Hope I helped…</p>
<p>If you need anything comment back.</p>
