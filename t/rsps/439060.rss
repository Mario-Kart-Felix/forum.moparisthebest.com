i don’t feel safe playing any non sponsored servers as much as this community (mopar/rl/r-s) has spoon fed people there launching all kinds of shit from the client, and its not that im naive enough to think sponsored server owner’s won’t do this, but it seems like there just less likely if they have paid money to advertise.<br>
