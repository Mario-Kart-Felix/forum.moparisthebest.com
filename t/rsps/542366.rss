    <description>I&#39;m fairly new to RSPS and I know how to do a bit of stuff, but which revision should I start on if I&#39;m new? What should be my first goals on achieving? Thanks :3</description>

<p>What are you even talking about…? Only a select few? I make my own applications in Java all the time and I’m at a pretty average level. Runescape private servers taught me the fundamental building blocks of object orientation, and I didn’t even start reading up on Java until I started learning about concurrency.</p>

              <p>[quote=“xxxtilllyxxx, post:19, topic:542366”]Yes, but not everybody is <span class="bbcode-i">you</span>, just look at all of the little kids downloading private servers, changing the name, and hosting them as their own. You are taught almost nothing. You copy a few tutorials, and you have your own server. You learn almost nothing. Some people are an exception, like you and me, Arham, etc. We actually learned things, and are able to use our knowledge outside of private servers, but most of the people here don’t know very much about the language at all.[/quote]I dunno, I was one of those little kids “begging for da code”. I tried learning Java properly but just couldn’t apply it to anything I wanted to do, and as a kid there’s no way I would have considered reading tutorials or books unless they were written in context of something fun and practical. The only intro Java books I know cover basic OO and simple programming. Not many kids want to write programs to calculate the area of a circle, or construct object-oriented banking models. It’s very easy to look back and say “Oh I would have started by learning assembly and using it to write my own C compiler as it would give me solid computer science foundations”, but you forget just how hard it was back then.</p>

You are taught almost nothing. You copy a few tutorials, and you have your own server. You learn almost nothing. Some people are an exception, like you and me, Arham, etc. We actually learned things, and are able to use our knowledge outside of private servers, but most of the people here don’t know very much about the language at all.</p>

<p>Indeed, but it’s not an issue for anyone lower than a category 3 moron. I don’t know where you’ve been working, but where I’ve worked they don’t give you a hard time because of a gap in your knowledge. As long as you find out and don’t take forever it’s not a big deal. You can’t be expected to know everything.</p>

<p>Yep, but there’s nothing wrong with giving it a little more context. When I started to learn programming I didn’t want to learn about chars and ints, I wanted to make games. Maybe that was just because I was a kid. RSPS provided me with a gateway into the programming paradigm and allowed me to excel as an experienced level 8 Java developer. Obviously if you’re 25 then no, stop messing around with silly private servers and go read some real Java tutorials because you’re a grown man for goodness sake.</p>

<p>I was more-or-less targeted towards your negative “Unless you’re a class 3 moron it’ll take you no time at all to “unlearn” any of these bad habits.”</p>
<p>To be honest, you might have more fun learning with RSPS, but once you jump into a real life application environment, you’re completely fucked. Just like those people who are IDE dependant, and can’t use anything but eclipse. If you don’t want to pursue Java is a potential future, RSPS is a great place to have fun, but if you want to take Java seriously, learn it seriously.</p>

<p>Not really , as there are different amount of people who love each revision so you should go with a revision that most people would love to play, For example if you choose an EoC revision, not much people like it therefore you wouldn’t attract as much player as you could have on another revision, But thought it depends, If you create amazing content then you might get a good amount of players, Who knows…[/quote]<br>
317s are the most documented, so I’d go with that.</p>
