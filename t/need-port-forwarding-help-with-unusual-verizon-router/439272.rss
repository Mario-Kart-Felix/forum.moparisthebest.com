    <title>-Need Port forwarding help with unusual Verizon router-</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-port-forwarding-help-with-unusual-verizon-router/439272</link>
    <description>I have searched everywhere for a guide on how to port forward with my router but I have only seen a few other people that even have the model..and none of them were using it for RSPS. I&#39;d really like some help over teamviewer or something please.
Thanks in advance to anyone willing to help.

              <p>Well since I just googled it…I recommend to follow a guide for minecraft…it should be exactly the same as you would for rsps.</p>
<p>I would help with teamviewer or something like that but I can’t atm…if you still have problems tomorrow pm me and I will try =/</p>
<p>EDIT: Make sure the port is 43594…or whatever you want it to be. The minecraft one is different.</p>
