[size=12pt][b]Eleonius : Tales of Gielinor[/b][/size]

(Had no Idea where to put this so, I put it here.)

[b]Prologue or Summary[/b]
The hero of Misthalin was Eleonius of the Heroes, who made the impossible, possible for everyone, would he save or destroy the Nation of Mistalin?

[b]Information[/b]
I made this because I was bored and all because I ended school couple of hours ago and I was pretty bored, realized I needed to improve my creativity, and my writing. (Grammar and Writing)
So I decided to write this to entertain myself, if you want this to continued then just post, I know at beginning it isn&#39;t interesting and all, but as the story goes further it gets better, all I have right now is Chapter one and two, and to be honest it isn&#39;t going that good, so please post suggestions and your opinions, I also know this isn&#39;t 100% perfect grammar and spelling.

[b]Chapter One : Arrival[/b]
[i](Narrator)[/i]

[b]Year 23 of the Fifth Age of Runescape[/b]

A man with blond hair, in fine medieval clothes, a crown, and a long beard rode a horse, faster than his companions who are barely catching up to him, in front of him are the gates of Varrock heavily guarded, but he knew that he couldn&#39;t be harmed so he rode on forth as fast as possible and the gates went open. The man quickly rode to the palace and before the horse stopped, he jumped immediately off his horse not even thinking what others would say about him and ran into the chamber room which the queen was held. The man was not too early nor too late, just as he walked in the doctor was holding an infant, the man walked up to the doctor and the doctor held out the infant and said &quot;Congratulations on your second son, King Orthros.&quot; and quickly left the room, he looked at his wife smiling and outside the palace was a crowd of thousands waiting for the outcome, the king held out his arms and said &quot;People of the city of Varrock and Nation of Misthalin! You have waited many days, weeks and months for this! Wondering if I would have another successor, but I have great news for all of you!&quot; he picked up the infant that a servant was holding and said &quot;This day is a great day, this is a day Saradomin himself told of a legacy, this is what he said,&quot; He took a deep breath and began reciting what Saradomin had said
[i]
Within the forest of the evil one,
A demon will rise,
Seven will hide and a hero or villian will come,
The boy will have the blue eyes of the sea, the gold hair of the horizon, the mind strong as Guthix&#39;s, smart as Bandos&#39;s mind in warfare, fair as Armadyl, and kind as Saradomin,
He will destroy the world or he will save it from destruction
Month of the Demons a boy will rise,
A decade after the destruction of the black knights fortress, 
and day of the rise of Saradomin,
And the hero will fight among thousands against  the blazing flames, spears of lighting, fists stronger than a mace, arrows that will block out the suns blazing light, shields that can deflect the attacks of the divine forces, waves of ice, and the demons fury,
The thousands will fight until their hands, legs, heads and body are chopped in pieces and only five will survive and hold off the armies of nearly two thousand that drained every single source they get their hands on,
He will one of the greatest victories the world will ever see,
But despair would rise,
Hundreds will die and one shall survive,
He would be the father of the villians of destruction or the father of the greatest heroes.[/i]

He looked at his son blue eyes and looked back at the crowd and started to explain &quot;This is the month of the demons, today is the day that the black knights fell, and also ten years after that day exactly, this is also a day Saradomin blessed my father King Tarrlo the First King enough power to unite the city states and tribes of Mistalin into a nation, my son has blue eyes and gold hair but we don&#39;t know if he is the hero of Misthalin yet, we will wait for the years to come and see if this boy is the hero of Misthalin, and as for my new son, we will celebrate!&quot;

[b]Chapter Two : The School[/b]
[i](Narrator)[/i]

A boy with blue eyes, gold hair, and a shape not too skinny, but not too fat for a twelve year old sat in a room of a school on top of a hill with some of his friends and other students, the instructor said &quot;Rune, what is the answer to question number three &#39;Name the god of balance.&#39;?,&quot; a boy sat there with neat short black hair started scratching his head and said &quot;Uhh, is it Lodius?&quot; the instructor looked at Rune with a disgusted look and said &quot;I don&#39;t remember there was even a god name Lodius, and you study more unless you want to end up as a screwed up noble.&quot; the instructor then pointed at another boy and asked him to answer the question, the boy said &quot;The god of balance is of course Guthix.&quot; the bell rang and the instructor said &quot;You may now go home children.&quot;.
As the kids walked out the door Rune tackled the boy with blue eyes, all the way down to the bottom of the hill, the boy yelled &quot;Get off me, you weight like three hundred pounds now!&quot; 
&quot;I weigh only eighty two!&quot; he replied.
&quot;Still you&#39;re heavy! Oh, by the way, did they tell you we have the final exams for the first time this year?&quot; the boy with blue eyes said.
Confused Rune said &quot;Huh? They never told me about anything about this,&quot; he quoted with his hands &quot;final exams, Eleonius tell me about it.&quot;
Eleonius rolled his eyes and began to speak but was interrupted by a boy with gray eyes and sort of gray hair, he interrupted by saying &quot;Hey guys! Whatcha doing?&quot;
Eleonius said &quot;I was about to explain what the final exams are to Rune, Dylan.&quot;
&quot;Tell us about it.&quot; Dylan said as he sat down on the grass around them, the other boys sat down and Eleonius began to speak &quot;All right, you came just in time though, the final exams is a test to decide if you are strong enough power to go on to year two of the school which consists of three years, we are near completing year one but there&#39;s five hundred and twenty five students also completing the first year with us, we are placed in teams of five so we would have to face,&quot; he stopped and started thinking but Rune beat him to it and said &quot;One hundred and five teams,&quot; smirking while holding a calculator, Eleonius continued &quot;Yea, so we will be facing that many teams on a field big as the Wilderness , well actually it&#39;s an arena big as the Wilderness and it&#39;s an exact replica of, it even has monsters and supplies, that&#39;s the arena set up for this year and --&quot; Rune interrupted and said &quot;Woah! Stop there, what do you mean by arena this year?&quot; looking confused, Eleonius rolled his eyes and said &quot;Obviously they won&#39;t let the exams take place on same place over and over, for example last year, the deans decided that the arena should be in Jad Fire Cape Challenge, they made the cave nearly thirty times bigger to make the cave look small to five hundred people, the part about it is that they forgot to teach the students how to use prayer protection so basically they got burnt, shot, and beaten up by the TzTok-Jad waves, the school didn&#39;t want an over crowded first years so they decided just to let everyone pass, I just wish I was in that year so I don&#39;t need to fight,&quot;.
Dylan mumbled to himself &quot;Such nice deans we have.&quot;
&quot;Wait, how do you know all this and where&#39;s the boat that ships us off this island because I   don&#39;t want to get killed by five hundred and twenty five students?&quot; said Rune
Eleonius slapped the front of his face with one of his hands and replied &quot;Dude, there&#39;s a pile of final exams information packets on the table in our cabins, unless your an idiot, didn&#39;t you see it?&quot;
Before Rune could answer, the bell rung and Dylan said &quot;Guys, let&#39;s talk about this tomorrow, last time I got detention I had to clean the stables of the unicorns, normally people think unicorns are pure and civilized and perfect, but you should really see what they do an hour later after they eat, yes if they&#39;re so perfect, then tell them to pick up their shit next time if you get detention.&quot;
The bell started ringing so we quickly ran to our cabin, we quickly opened the door quickly and also in time because the hired Vyrewatch curfew moniter just threw her spear (It doesn&#39;t kill but it paralizes you so she can tie you up and take you to dean, and if so she tapes your mouth if you make too much noises) and it landed on the door.
