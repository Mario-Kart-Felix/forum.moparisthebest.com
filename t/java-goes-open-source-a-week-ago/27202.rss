<p>The point is we dont NEED every processor to understand java natively to get the speed of natively compiled code. Hotspot will turn java code into natively compiled code ANYWAY. Not to mention runtime optomoisations.</p>
<p>Oh and, I mentioned nuclear power plants BECAUSE of the disclaimer. Did you ever wonder why they said that about java se? Because of the nature of the language, it wasnt ‘real time’. Which is the point of real time java, ‘mission critical java’. <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/realtime.jsp" rel="nofollow noopener">http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/realtime.jsp</a> (which I have already linked to). They may not say real time java can be used in nuclear power plants, but it goes a LONG way into addressing issues as to why it couldnt previously be used.</p>
<p>Learn, to, read, idiot.</p>
<p>Q: Why isn’t Java technology used predominantly in real-time systems today?</p>
<p>The adoption of Java technology in traditional real-time markets has been limited by the inability to predictably control the temporal execution of applications due to:<br>
Unpredictable latencies introduced by automatic memory management (garbage collectors)<br>
Inadequate scheduling control<br>
Unpredictable synchronization delays<br>
Very coarse timer support<br>
No asynchronous event processing<br>
No “safe” asynchronous transfer of control[br][size=1]Posted at: November 29, 2006, 01:01:06 PM[/size][hr]I would like a reply javacisnotrecognised.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Sean, post:42, topic:27202”]be there too. Also java would never, ever, ever rely on such a chip as it would destroy what java is about, cross platform compatibility.</p>
<p>All you have to do is implement a vm and the native sections of the j2se to have java running on <em>any</em> system. Regardless of archietecture, operating system etc. Aslong as you implement java for this system, a vast amount of apis and applications follow for free. Ok this is quite an undertaking but meh.[/quote]</p>
<p>No, this would be about making Java as fast as native machine code - which would be an opportunity that can not be adequitely described for large companies that rely heavily on Java IE Sun or Jagex.</p>
<blockquote>Lets now discuss garbage collection, ALOT of work has been also put into this, it is allowing us developers to be lazy. But it has to be good, it has to run enough times to clean up the mess, it cant slow down the applications cycle - we have to be able to RELY on it.

              <p>I did believe you btw mopman, its old stuff. Not much work has been done on it recently however, there have been other projects thou (as you stated sun ditched theirs and sold it a long time ago). IIRC it was last year some company started retailing server chips with java being understood natively.</p>
<p>You would not need two chips, two processors etc, just one chip which understands asm and java bytecodes. However, this rotue was mainly considered a long time ago before the advent of hotspot - I think pre jit too I think. The way it pans out at the moment can actually show better speeds from code run in the jvm (running hotspot not interped mode) than you can recieve from natively understood opcodes. Of course a processor that understands java bytecodes is not the end of the situation thou. Garbage collection, the api library, all this has to be there too. Also java would never, ever, ever rely on such a chip as it would destroy what java is about, cross platform compatibility.</p>
<p>All you have to do is implement a vm and the native sections of the j2se to have java running on <em>any</em> system. Regardless of archietecture, operating system etc. Aslong as you implement java for this system, a vast amount of apis and applications follow for free. Ok this is quite an undertaking but meh.</p>
<p>I personally feel that native java opcodes in processors isnt a concern anymore, it isnt going to do anything for java that our current vms cannot. There has been alot of work put innto java, especially the vm. Much reasarch has went into it, and alot of phd owning developers times.</p>
<p>For those of you who arent aware hotspot is based on the 80-20 theory, which is quite sound (of course there are exceptions to every rule). It states 80% of the time is spent in 20% of the code, so following from this the vm marks methods where time is spent in, recurring calls to methods. It uses this information to identify the hotspots (see what they did there? huh huh :p). Once the hotspots are identified they can be AGRESSIVELY optomised to a level that no static compiler could ever reach. Of course it compiles these sections to native code, thats a given, but what it also does it CONDITONAL OPTOMISATIONS (this is just one of many features hotspot performs unavailable to static compiled).</p>
<p>Consider if you will a for loop with a variable end point, if the vm sees that 90% of the time this for loop executes (and it will have to be executed alot for the vm to be analyzing it to this level) the same number of times, it will do unrolll the loop (increases performance) for this set number of iterations. Now you may think OMG WHAT IF IT NEEDS TO EXECUTE A DIFERENT NUMBER OF TIMES THAN THE CONDITIONAL OPTOMISATION HAS ALLOWED FOR. Well, thats why its conditional. If the case happens where the conditonal optomisation does not fit the required execution, it will fall back to a less optomised version so that it works as expected.</p>
<p>So what does this all mean? It means as the hotspot warms up (identifys the key areas of your applications execuation) you will end u with some very optomised and potentially conditionally optomised code, which has been continually refined by the vm.</p>
<p>Lets now discuss garbage collection, ALOT of work has been also put into this, it is allowing us developers to be lazy. But it has to be good, it has to run enough times to clean up the mess, it cant slow down the applications cycle - we have to be able to RELY on it. In some situations this just clearly inst good enough. See: nuclear power plant.</p>
<p>Every gc iteration is using up a cetain amount of resources for this cycle, this could cause that reactor meltdown. But down worry, you can just use real time java see: <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/realtime.jsp" rel="nofollow noopener">http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/realtime.jsp</a> . This is part of the beauty of java, you can interchange aspects to tailor it to your needs. Moreso now with the opensourcing of java (I will discuss the open sourcing more in a minute). And lets not forget all of those tweeking options you can do to the gc and other key aspects of the vm. (inc hotspot).</p>
<p>So yeah, putting all of these features on a chip is certainly possible, but limits your ability to tweek them, which is why I feel these java chips arent something which are important. Back when sun was considering them? Sure, java was still interpreted back then, speed was a major issue, we didnt have these technologies to bring us up to par (well close enough, sometimes faster thou, all situation dependant) with compiled c/c++. Of course a tightly written asm procedure will most likely beat java, but thats not much of a concern here, it would beat c++/c too.</p>
<p>So what DOES open source java bring us? Well, adoption from a wide variety of FOSS bodies hopefully. Richard stallman (the man who wrote the article - the java trap - a key member of the gnu - indeed he was actually the founder) praised sun for releasing ‘java’ under the gpl. This is a man that commands alot of respect from the open source sector, he is a hard man who wont accept ‘almost open source’. I dont agree with him on all of his opinions, but I can respect his ethical values. For a man like him to be praising this move is REALLY something, something I NEVER thought would happen. But I am moving away from the point again.</p>
<p>Sun has only actually opened THEIR IMPLEMENTATION OF JAVA. Now this is actually quite different than opening java. The java specification and trademarks are still closed, you cant change the behaviour of a method, add methods etc and call it java. This isnt java, for it to be java it HAS to adhere to the CLOSED specificaiton. Controlled by the JCP via JSRs and the community - and at the end of the day sun (thou its mainly governed by the companies in it, something i dont agree with to a certain degree, I wish I got a vote comparable to ibms =p).</p>
<p>It is suns implementation that you can have the code to, which is a major code base, and you can edit it, you can redistribute it, you can submit patches for it (this hasnt really changed thou since it was being closed source, you still have to give sun rights to the code you commit understandably.)</p>
<p>Hopefully this move will get unix distros shipping java as standard too. Alot of them did not agreewith the licensing, and infact untill recently with the advent of the DLJ (distributor license for java) they couldnt really anyway. But now with suns gpl java implementation all of these issues are a thing of the past. No longer will the distros (hopefully atleast) only come with gjc / kaffe / other java vm/compiler variants.</p>
<p>JRL (java research license) did have its restrictions upon reading the code, but no longer an issue.</p>
<p>But yeah, its a semi jesture to get people to put more trust into java, no more ‘if sun goes bankrupt then we are fucked’ talk. There used to be a clause in the sun java terms that if sun said so, you had to delete ANY sun java implementation on your system (in the case of a patent issue forcing them into doing this no doubt, but it made some people worry I guess). No longer an issue!</p>
<p>Ps src.zip only contained stubs, to get the source you had to download it from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Sorry for the huge post, im sitting here bored and ive had too much caffine. Not to mention I love the click click sound of this funky old keyboard I have hooked up to my laptop. Makes me feel powerful, can you feel that? Its power. Yar. =)</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Although at the time of writing this afaik all the information is accurate, it happens to be 6am and im tired, and not a lawyer, dont work at sun etc. I hold no liability for any information that results in mutalated cats… dogs… maybe.</p>
