And for the russian fuck above if it wasnt for us you would have lost more then you did in world war II you lost 6 million taking berlin as we were sitting outside waiting for you to get there because you wanted it. fucking commies dont know how to fight.</p>

<p>I agree, it’s pretty pointless. That’s why I say it anyway. It’s not like it’s a binding contract that says you support everything America is doing in the world, it’s just a silly flag.

<p>Firstly we aliens are bound by law to say the pledge when we get our citizanship. And I am not too lazy to stand up, I just told you that I find it a bit too dramatic and pointless talking to a flag everyday. [I prefer praying to God over a  flag]</p>
<p>Secondly I am not a little kid, I believe in the fact that it does look great how America puts attention into that, just that fact that it does not have to be an everyday thing, if they want it that way then we should be allowed to pray everyday at school, same thing in some ways.</p>

<p>To me, talking into a cell phone looks and sounds stupid. I hate cell phones, and the people who talk into them as if nobody exists around them. Cell phones have caused more deaths and discomfort than the pledge ever has. My point is, that the pledge is basically harmless, even if it is stupid.[/quote]</p>
