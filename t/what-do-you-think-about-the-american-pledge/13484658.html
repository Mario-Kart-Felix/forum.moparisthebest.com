here is my $.002</p>
<p>(if you dont want to read everything, read summary below)</p>
<p>we are under god, i dont care if you atheist or if your muslim, your still under god, he is a supieror being and therefore he owns you…</p>
<p>and if you dont like the pledge get the hell out of america…</p>
<p>and with all this hispanic rights shit, if you dont like the way this country is being ran, get the hell out(half of you snuck across anyways)its a democracy and you arnt even legal(thats what all the bills are about) so…</p>
<p>in conclusion(summary)</p>
<p>IF YOU DONT LIKE AMERICA, GET THE HELL OUT…</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Sorry, but your post just shows to me how intolerant and narrow-minded you are.  Why should you need to agree with the pledge to be allowed to reside in the US, especially considering that the pledge was written for some advertising campaign or something?  That made no sense to me, and just fyi, the US is not a true democracy.[/quote]</p>
<p>and fyi for you noob, GET THE HELL OUT <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyc164.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>anyways, the pledge of allegiance should be required and im going to work untill it it, it shows that you are low to the best country in the world and that you want to live here… you cant just come here and make millions and still say us sucks, fuck you noob, we are the greatest power and have the richest economy.</p>

<p>doomsday: Are you really being serious?  Because to be honest, I don’t know.  First off I never said that America sucks, did I?  And what do you mean by I am “low to the best country in the world and I want to live here”?  I do live in America, I was born here, and I am a citizen.

<p>your constituition does say church and govt will be seperate does it not?[/quote]</p>
<p>what makes us the best country… well lets look at the facts</p>
<p>The US has the largest and most technologically powerful economy in the world, with a per capita GDP of $42,000. In this market-oriented economy, private individuals and business firms make most of the decisions, and the federal and state governments buy needed goods and services predominantly in the private marketplace. US business firms enjoy greater flexibility than their counterparts in Western Europe and Japan in decisions to expand capital plant, to lay off surplus workers, and to develop new products. At the same time, they face higher barriers to enter their rivals’ home markets than foreign firms face entering US markets. US firms are at or near the forefront in technological advances, especially in computers and in medical, aerospace, and military equipment; their advantage has narrowed since the end of World War II. The onrush of technology largely explains the gradual development of a “two-tier labor market” in which those at the bottom lack the education and the professional/technical skills of those at the top and, more and more, fail to get comparable pay raises, health insurance coverage, and other benefits. Since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to the top 20% of households. The response to the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 showed the remarkable resilience of the economy. The war in March-April 2003 between a US-led coalition and Iraq, and the subsequent occupation of Iraq, required major shifts in national resources to the military. The rise in GDP in 2004 and 2005 was undergirded by substantial gains in labor productivity. The economy suffered from a sharp increase in energy prices in mid-2005, but by late in the year those prices dropped back to earlier levels. Hurricane Katrina caused extensive damage in the Gulf Coast region in August 2005, but had a small impact on overall GDP growth for the year. Long-term problems include inadequate investment in economic infrastructure, rapidly rising medical and pension costs of an aging population, sizable trade and budget deficits, and stagnation of family income in the lower economic groups.<br>

        <p>Keep in mind that all this “Under God” and “In God we Trust” stuff got thrown in 1945-1955 in response to state athiesm in the big Red. I personally am a hard athiest, not a thiest, diest or agnostic, and don’t care about some word that make people feel better about the disconnect between what they say they believe and what they do. I do think that while only 3% of the US have the balls to admit they believe in a godless universe, 11-20% of americans are unreligious or agnostic.</p>
<p>A lot more people find the inclusion of the belief in god to be tasteless and troubling in a pledge we make young chiuldren say.  What good is a forced prayer? Jews feel that the name of god is acred and should not be said out of church “2nd commandment, read it sometime” but that is the secret namme YHWH (jehova or yaweh).</p>
<p>I personally feel it is just a typical US “Christian” hypocracy, ignore the teachings of christ and use his name as a justifiocation for whatever small minded bullshit you want to believe in.</p>

        <p>Unless of course your atheist, which is ok. The constitution permits that. But I think you dont have to be sooo atheist that you try to ruin the pledge that has been in our country for about 100 years now. Just say under God or dont say it at all, but don’t make a big stink over it. I know a kid who is an atheist he says the pledge like everyone else, I asked him why he says “under god” if he is an atheist.</p>
<p>He replied, because its what Americans do. And its not worth my time and energy to make a big stink out of it.</p>

Your right… Not once… But Twice… As for canadians… and french people… You couldn’t defend your own country… Only reason why no one attacks canada because U.S.A is right next to you… BTW: If america tried to take over canada it would be like Bush running for Presidency… Easy win…</p>

Maybe the reason no one attacks Canada is because they are strong supporters of multilateralism and don’t tend to interfere with the affairs of other governments?</p>
<p>I would also like to add that if America for some reason decided to take over Canada, there would most likely be enormous opposition by the UN as well as the rest of the world.  Comparing the ease of taking over Canada to Bush’s wins when running for president (both of which he won by a very narrow popular vote margin) makes no sense to me.</p>
<p>I also fail to see what this has to do with the American Pledge.</p>

<p>Maybe Japan didn’t just attack Pearl Harbor out of the blue…Soon after WWII started, the US renounced their trade agreement with Japan (which began in like 1850ish), meaning that as the US would no longer trade with Japan, Japan had almost no oil (they got like 80% from USA).  So their choice was to either give up the war or try and make a point.  There’s always a reason for everything man…large events in history like the Attack on Pearl Harbor don’t just occur spontaneously.</p>
<p>Yes, I don’t entirely understand what the French did during and after the revolution period (I haven’t covered much French history), but you can’t seriously discredit a country for it’s actions 200 years ago.  Seriously, we in the US were a bunch of traitors 200 years ago…</p>
<p>Also, I don’t understand why all of my remarks are stupid when they express another side of the viewpoint others have expressed and I try to back them up with fact…not to mention that this is the debate forum.</p>
