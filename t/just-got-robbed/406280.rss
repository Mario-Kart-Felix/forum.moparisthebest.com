    <title>Just got robbed</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/just-got-robbed/406280</link>
    <description>Just got home, I was chillen with my bro and we went biking, and there were these 3 kids.  Their younger brother, threatened to kill my cousin with a bat earlier. So back on track, as we we&#39;re biking they said that we we&#39;re pussies, so my idiot brother called him a stupid fucktard (sorry for racism)Paki. They chased us, we biked as fast as we can, but these guys were fast, they were 13, 17, and 19. I ditched onto a street and hid inside some bushes while my brother kept on, with my bullshit luck they found me. They pulled me out and beat the shit out of me and stole my $1500 bike (Pro Dyno Mountain Bike). My brother came back to see what happened, they ran and threw him off my other bike that I lent my brother, they took it to their house and we called the cops. Cops came and they asked if we knew anything about them, luckily they were infront of their house, and we said we knew where they lived. They caught the 17 year old on my bike and they jumped out and cuffed him, they searched his bag and found about 10 Grams of weed and 2 bottles of Canadian Club Whisky, In the end I got my bikes back, hes arrested for 7 charges including: 2x Robbery, 2x Possession, 2x Assault and 1 for threatening me infront of the cops. While that&#39;s my story, Comment on it.</description>

<p>What the hell is that? It’s one thing people saying it, but it’s another seeing it. I’ve never seen anything like on that video in my area. Of course there will be areas that contain stupid people but they’re usually sorted out, yes?</p>
<p>I mean really? I think we all know that person either needs shooting or is a wannabe. Even in the rough areas it isn’t THAT bad.[/quote]</p>

<p>What the hell is that? It’s one thing people saying it, but it’s another seeing it. I’ve never seen anything like on that video in my area. Of course there will be areas that contain stupid people but they’re usually sorted out, yes?</p>
<p>I mean really? I think we all know that person either needs shooting or is a wannabe. Even in the rough areas it isn’t THAT bad. I think it’s just a case of him trying to make himself look like a gangster.</p>
