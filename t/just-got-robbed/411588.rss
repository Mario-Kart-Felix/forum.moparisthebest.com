    <title>Just got robbed</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/just-got-robbed/411588</link>
    <description>At a bus station for 3 zips (84 grams) of Purple Kush, $500 cash, my ipod and phone.  Jumped by two black guys who then just ran off, ditched my bag, and by the time I discovered all they took were long gone.

Buut, the good news is, all that $ was my dealer&#39;s for fronted haze, so with his help we found out who the guys were.  We can roll up today and break their legs with bats and that seemssss to be the best choice but I was wondering if anyone else had any idea how to do with these people (obviously police can not be involved since the stolen property included illegal drugs lol).  I&#39;m not a violent person but when it comes to something like this its a survival thing, I NEED to get that stuff back to pay rent and avoid myself getting jumped again.

Thoughts?  Thanks lol.</description>

Yakman: And if you take into consideration that most murders is suicides, guns does cause more harm, than they prevent.<br>

<p>How about you show me some numbers, facts and evidence to back up the assertion you just pulled out your arse.[/quote]<br>
For Norway:<br>
<a href="http://www.ssb.no/emner/03/01/10/nos_dodsarsak/nos_d411/tab/tab1.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.ssb.no/emner/03/01/10/nos_dodsarsak/nos_d411/tab/tab1.html</a> (Norwegian, Sjølvmord = Suicide, Drap = Murder)<br>
12 times as much suicides than murders.</p>
<p>But I should be clearer in my definition. Murder-suicide and suicide is completely different. I meant that more people got killed by themself, than other people.</p>
<p>For US:<br>
And firearms are the most used suicide method for males in US: <a href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/suicide-in-the-us-statistics-and-prevention/index.shtml" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/suicide-in-the-us-statistics-and-prevention/index.shtml</a><br>
If you have the murder stats for US, and compare it with the US suicide stats over, you would find that I wasn’t wrong.</p>
<p>If you are gonna call someone stupid, be sure you are RIGHT next time.</p>

              <p>Im openly against guns mostly now, but im not for making them illegal. I just think they need to be taken MUCH more seriously saleswise, along with background checks and records. Stripping the average good guy hunter joe of is firearms is just stupid, and all you do is raise murder brutality by forcing knives to be used. Id rather be shot once than have an attacker stab me once and then panic that he may have been close enough to be identified, and then stab me excessively. And in America we have some seriously rural places that you see people carrying around guns on their belt, and I don’t blame them. That isn’t a common site in suburban areas or cities though.</p>

<p>So 4.5% are suicides.</p>
<p>If I may say so, I’ve noticed how a lot of conservatives just don’t seem to know or understand evidence. They seem to prefer hearsay and prejudice.<br>
It’s also pretty interesting to note that throughout history, scientists, inventors, academics and philosophers have been some of the most progressive in their time.<br>
Conservatives are usually the ones that burn them, lie about them, deny the facts and praise the discredited status-quo.</p>

              <blockquote>Most people keep guns in their homes for self-protection. The image of an unknown criminal breaking into your house is an important one for gun advocates, because it justifies keeping a gun in the home. But to gun control advocates, a gun in the home means that a family fight or a drinking binge is more likely to turn deadly. Which view is more accurate? 
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Keeping a gun in the home carries a murder risk 2.7 times greater than not keeping one, according to a study by Arthur Kellermann. The National Rifle Association has fiercely attacked this study, but it remains valid despite its criticisms. The study found that people are 21 times more likely to be killed by someone they know than a stranger breaking into the house. Half of the murders were over arguments or romantic triangles. The study also found that the increased murder rate in gun-owning households was entirely due to an increase in gun homicides only, not any other murder method. It further found that gun-owning households saw an increased murder risk by family or intimate acquaintances, not by strangers or non-intimate acquaintances. The most straightforward explanation is that the presence of a gun increases the possibility that a normal family fight or drinking binge will become deadly. No other explanation fits the above facts.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Newty, post:73, topic:411588”]It must be a northern america (ohio, michigan, wisconsin, etc) that instills this mentality into people like moparisthebest and I. Where I grew up we were raised around guns, the outdoors, etc and being raised around it we were taught the responsibilities of things such as guns. We know that there is only one circumstance that would ever allow a gun to be pointed and used on another person, and that is if you feel that your life or the life of others around you are in mortal danger. Even then we know what a huge decision taking another persons life would be (hence taking the class that allows you to carry a concealed weapon) and we know that its not a decision that should be taken lightly.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long winded horrible looking post but I just can’t quit understand the thought behind europeans (any non american??) not seeing why lethal retaliation in some situations is a choice that is made for you by the person (thug, rapist, murderer, etc) who is threatening your life and not by you (minding your own business and most likely in the right place at the wrong time).[/quote]<br>
i live in michigan too, but i dont have this mentality. although, my parents moved here in their twenties, and definitely aren’t normal<br>
also, i go to school in detroit/have spent a lot of time there. if you keep your head about you, 99.5% of the time you’ll be okay. (like, i was in a shady neighborhood once outside a foreclosed home, we saw the power was on and hesitated for a sec and there was a guy pointing a rifle at us from the porch… if we kept on moving/didn’t turn the corner we probably wouldn’t have gotten into that situation). i understand that there are situations that are out of your control, but they’re less than 1%, even in detroit. i’m not anti-gun per-say, i understand the value of it, but i don’t think stricter gun control laws would hurt. also, detroit needs reform</p>

I said you are in imminent danger of your life being taken, as in 4 guys with knives are approaching you saying they will kill you, etc etc.  Not that someone threatened your life and you have time to go to the police.  The police can’t help you in a situation like that, and if you don’t have the right to defend yourself, who can defend you?</p>

That is how it was here too, but, thankfully, the law was changed a few years ago regarding self-defense.  It used to be if you killed someone in self-defense, the burden was on you to prove it actually was a legal self-defense case.  If you couldn’t meet your burden of proof, you were found guilty and went to jail.  (which made it basically guilty until proven innocent)  Now the law is that the burden of proof is on the prosecutor to prove that it WASN’T self-defense, so it’s much better now.</p>

<p>You’re acting like the odds of you ever getting attacked by someone are so high, that it justifies the mass distribution of weapons.[/quote]<br>
Most people have house insurance, even though the chances of their house burning to the ground is low.  You probably wear a helmet when riding a motorcycle, or a seat belt when in a car, because it can’t hurt anything and, though you hope you never actually need to use it, it will save your life one day if you have to.  Same with carrying a gun.</p>

Sorry for the long winded horrible looking post but I just can’t quit understand the thought behind europeans (any non american??) not seeing why lethal retaliation in some situations is a choice that is made for you by the person (thug, rapist, murderer, etc) who is threatening your life and not by you (minding your own business and most likely in the right place at the wrong time).<br>

<p>I know the odds are low, especially where I live. But I also know that we have an unfix-able gun problem and that some very fucked up people are in possession of them. So if they are going around shooting people, (as of last Sunday there were 238 gun related deaths in Detroit this year) I would rather be safe then sorry. At least we do it legally and we aren’t like random thugs on the street who carry it because they think of it as something that makes them cooler.</p>

              <p>It must be a northern america (ohio, michigan, wisconsin, etc) that instills this mentality into people like moparisthebest and I. Where I grew up we were raised around guns, the outdoors, etc and being raised around it we were taught the responsibilities of things such as guns. We know that there is only one circumstance that would ever allow a gun to be pointed and used on another person, and that is if you feel that your life or the life of others around you are in mortal danger. Even then we know what a huge decision taking another persons life would be (hence taking the class that allows you to carry a concealed weapon) and we know that its not a decision that should be taken lightly.</p>

<p>You carry a gun around, and would probably shoot someone for trespassing/stealing on your property. Where I live this would make you a thug/criminal on both accounts. Also illegal (obviously).<br>

<p>No.  I’d only shoot someone if my life or the life of a member of my family was in immediate danger.  That doesn’t make me a thug or criminal, everyone has the right to self defense.[/quote]</p>

<p>Also, one final word of warning.  Be very glad that you didn’t do that to a car belonging to a guy like me who has a concealed carry permit and always carries his gun.  You could have all ended up dead.</p>
