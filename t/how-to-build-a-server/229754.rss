    <title>How to Build a Server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-build-a-server/229754</link>
    <description>I have played on many different private servers and I haven&#39;t been completely satisfied with any of them.  That&#39;s why I want to build my own server from scratch.  The only problem is that I don&#39;t really know how to.  I was thinking about using the  rs2dv base stickied in the downloads section.  I just have no clue where to begin.  If anyone can post links to guides or give me any information that may help please do. Also let me know if you need to know anything else. Thanks.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 04, 2008, 08:51:10 pm[/size][hr]I was looking on the forums and I found these:

              <p>Those 3 guides will help you setup rs2d and the first will help you make a handler for commands. For a first server rs2d isn’t exactly the best choice unless you are extremely <span class="bbcode-u">willing to learn Java</span>, instead of “RSPS code” as others call it in wL sources.</p>
