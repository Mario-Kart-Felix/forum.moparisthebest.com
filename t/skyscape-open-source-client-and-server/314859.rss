    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/skyscape-open-source-client-and-server/314859</link>
    <description>The following is a 317 server based off the PearlScape source. I take no credit for most of the work put into this source/project. The credits will go as follows so there is no question of the accuracy of my post:
PearlScape project coders: 80%
SkyScape Producers: 5%
Me: 15% for adding in some additional code (nothing much), providing for the common resources needed to run such a server, and having the legal right to such a software.
Please note this software challenges the &quot;copyright&quot; (of which doesn&#39;t exist legally) of the SkyScape producers which may exist in a typed-up form but has no jurisdiction in any court of law due to the fact there was no official copyright. If someone claiming to be the user sky should question the legitimacy of this post do not lock this topic just because he shows proof of his 5% as much of the works are mine. Also note there will be no images or features displayed below as this is a almost blank source with very few features. You must download the source to find out the features. If you require, i may post a video of me executing the software on my computer. The client provided will direct you to an address different from your server&#39;s address, you must change all server-sided/client-sided settings for this source to work on your server(s)/computer(s). The main purpose of this server is to challenge SkyScape in their illegal copyrighting and other illegal methods which are quite annoying just as we all challenged Jagex in the very beginning with building our own private servers. Please understand my position in this matter.
Thanks,
Andrew4444

              <p>::donorzone is only for donators which have to be assigned by the owner which you must change to yourself by editing the player “sky” to your name in the commands file, unfortunately if you don’t do this it won’t let you preform the command. Sorry if i don’t make any sense or am being just too complicated. I am also very glad two people so far like the source.</p>

I'll add this to the rules after i feel its been taken to by the members.
<p>Well since you have all been ignoring or just not understanding it so i’ll make it clear here. Whenever you post a server or a client with the source code included you agree to the fact other people can use it. If you don’t want people “Leeching” your work then you do not release it, simple as.</p>
<p>Even still, most of you are using wL based servers and have no right in claiming that as your own, same with jagex’s client. You however can credit yourself for whatever code you have added and if the code you have added is someone elses then you credit them either in the topic and in comments in the source code.</p>
<p>Basically:<br>
Quote from: Moparisthebest on June 18, 2008, 04:51:37 am<br>
Just make them all credit winterlove and daiki…<br>
I’ll add, credit Jagex and if you have used anyone elses code they have released and you have added that code to the client or the server credit them too.</p>
<p>I’ll give this a day or two for people to notice this sticky before i start full on enforcing the rules and handing out punishments to those who break it, there will be no exceptions, you can recieve anything from a warn to mute depending on what you post. If you do find someone releasing a server or a client with someone elses code who is not credited them please just ask them nicely to credit that person, if they do not after you asking them to then report that person and a member of staff will take it from there.</p>
<p>Percentages:<br>
Just name the people you are crediting, don’t bother making up random percentages unless you can provide the equations on how you get these percentages.<br>
Quote from: Projext on June 20, 2008, 10:25:32 pm<br>
So like instead of going<br>
Code:</p>
<p>10% credit to you<br>
and 90% credits to me!</p>
<p>Make like a list of all the people who helped and contributed into your productions and end results which are out for release</p>
<p>EG:<br>
Code:</p>
<p>Thug-Life<br>
Projext<br>
_Reforced<br>
More Names</p>
<p>And don’t forget anyone Wink</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Moderators</span>, Admins etc: If i have missed anything or feel this needs to be changed, feel free to contact me on irc.</p>
<p>Plus, i don’t need any ‘Thanks good rule’ type posts, don’t post if you don’t have anything constructive to say.</p>

Already done, I named the groups of which contributed as clearly stated above.

              <p>The following is a 317 server based off the PearlScape source. I take no credit for most of the work put into this source/project. The credits will go as follows so there is no question of the accuracy of my post:<br>
PearlScape project coders: 80%<br>
SkyScape Producers: 5%<br>
Me: 15% for adding in some additional code (nothing much), providing for the common resources needed to run such a server, and having the legal right to such a software.<br>
Please note this software challenges the “copyright” (of which doesn’t exist legally) of the SkyScape producers which may exist in a typed-up form but has no jurisdiction in any court of law due to the fact there was no official copyright. If someone claiming to be the user sky should question the legitimacy of this post do not lock this topic just because he shows proof of his 5% as much of the works are mine. Also note there will be no images or features displayed below as this is a almost blank source with very few features. You must download the source to find out the features. If you require, i may post a video of me executing the software on my computer. The client provided will direct you to an address different from your server’s address, you must change all server-sided/client-sided settings for this source to work on your server(s)/computer(s). The main purpose of this server is to challenge SkyScape in their illegal copyrighting and other illegal methods which are quite annoying just as we all challenged Jagex in the very beginning with building our own private servers. Please understand my position in this matter.<br>
