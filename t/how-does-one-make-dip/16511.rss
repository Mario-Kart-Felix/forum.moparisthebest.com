              <p>While the tobacco is growing make a fertilizer by crushing up mint leaves or peaches, and mixing the juice with some fertilizer and water, then water the plants with the liquid. Also, place pieces of your flavoring all around the tobacco, for example, wash some fresh mint leaves and place them all around where the tobacco is aging and/or being heat cured. If they are moist, the dry tobacco will rapidly absorb the flavor.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <blockquote>One to three high-quality leaves are braided and twisted into a rope while green, and then are cured in the same manner as other tobacco.
<p>To cure tobacco, cut plants or pulled leaves are immediately transferred to tobacco barns (kiln houses), where they will be cured. Curing methods varies with the type of tobacco grown, and tobacco barn design varies accordingly. Air-cured tobacco is hung in well-ventilated barns and allowed to dry over a period of weeks. Fire-cured tobacco is hung in large barns where smoldering fires of hardwoods are kept burning. Flue-cured tobacco was originally strung onto tobacco sticks, which were hung from tier-poles in curing barns (Aus: kilns, also traditionally called Oasts). These barns have flues which run from externally-fed fire boxes, heat-curing the tobacco without exposing it to smoke. Traditional curing barns in the U.S. are falling into disuse, as the trend toward more efficient prefabricated metal \“bulk bars\”, allows greater efficiency. Curing and subsequent aging allows for the slow oxidation and degradation of carotenoids in tobacco leaf. This produces certain compounds in the tobacco leaves very similar and give a sweet hay, tea, rose oil, or fruity aromatic flavor that contribute to the \“smoothness\” of the smoke. Starch is converted to sugar which glycates protein and is oxidized into advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), a caramelization process that also adds flavor. Inhalation of these AGEs in tobacco smoke contributes to atherosclerosis and cancer[2].</p>
<p>Unaged or low quality tobacco is often flavoured with these naturally occurring compounds. Tobacco flavoring is a significant part of a multi-million dollar industry.</p>
<p>The aging process continues for a period of months and often extends into the post-curing process.</p>
