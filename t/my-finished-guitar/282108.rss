    <title>My Finished Guitar!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-finished-guitar/282108</link>
    <description>I spent the most time I&#39;ve spent on a model on this thing (2-3 Hours). I know it&#39;s not as good as CJ&#39;s but I think it&#39;s pretty decent.

Here&#39;s something I was gonna try to finish but it already sucks so I don&#39;t want to finish it. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s been done before.

Well done.[/quote]<br>
Well first of all I’m just going to tell you that I don’t know much about guitars. That made this a little trickier.<br>

I used this for the outline. Everything else I just made free hand and tried to follow your video.</p>

<p>Strings a very difficult, because of the different sizes and such.</p>
<p>Nice Teejay, but you might wan’t to fix up the wonky bits, just so it looks a bit straighter.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m not going to add strings to this one I might try on my next guitar though. It will probably look cooler.</p>
