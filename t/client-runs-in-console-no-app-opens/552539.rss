    <title>Client runs in console, no app opens</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-runs-in-console-no-app-opens/552539</link>
    <description>Just getting back into programming after a 6 month break and I am trying to get this client to load. I run it in eclipse, it says something is running in the console but no app ever opens. Does anyone have any ideas as to how to find what is causing it? I&#39;ve tried debugging a little bit, but I didnt find anything important. Ideas?</description>
