    <description>Hey fellow forum readers. I downloaded the Deathlypvpz V3 source and client, and I can&#39;t seem to figure out how I can solve the wall-through flower problem. (I can&#39;t seem to solve the problem I face by going through the wall when I plant a flower). Any solutions? Please do help as soon as possible. It would kindly be appreciated. :D
