    <description>Ive recently started to play again and noticed that people now bet hot/cold on flowers. Does anyone know if theres some way to tell (patterns etc) what colour will be planted?
Assuming you watch a few flowers being planted first. Would be interesting to see if its 100% random or theres a trick to it ;)</description>

<p>I don’t think that simulation is meaningful - you’re using experimental data to run further simulations on the same variable. As the number of trials approaches infinity in your simulation the percentages will come to the sum of the percentages in the original table.</p>

I whipped up a simulator (source available on request if anyone wants it) and simulated 1,000,000 matches.  The results:</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>Flower Statistics:<br>
1000000 matches.</p>
<pre><code>Betting Hot:
	Win:  46.173%
	Lose: 53.827%

Betting Cold:
	Win:  41.5255%
	Lose: 58.4745%

Not Playing:
	Win:  100%
	Lose: 0%
</code></pre>
<p>A strange game. The only winning move is not to play. How about a nice game of chess?[/quote]</p>
<p>EDIT: Oh and I used the percentages provided by maminerr.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not playing would give neither loss or win.</p>
<p>Use the roulette trick, that would increase the odds by a lot.</p>
<p>I took a test, and I assume it is wrong.<br>
Let say you have x gp<br>
1: You start betting 1% of your current. (Rounding up to nearest gp)<br>
2: Play a Game.<br>
3: If you lose, multiply that sum by 10 and GOTO 2. else If you win, GOTO 1.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#:</span> If you cannot pay the next bet, GOTO 1.<br>
<span class="hashtag">#:</span> If you you have to little money, stop wasting your time.</p>
<p>This gave me a 100% win rate when I simulated it, but I assume there is some mistakes, and it doesn’t take into account scamming.[/quote]Was a reference to a movie, “War Games” lol</p>

<p>the scheme would be hosting the games. another thing i’ve seen people do is prey on older accounts that have been abandoned with wealth. simply dox the original owner and recover away (i’m not sure about the legality of this, but uh - yeah… caution :P).</p>

<p>Percentage wise, you lose. If you pick hot, the odds are 46% vs 53,49%. If you pick cold, the odds are 41,3% vs 58,19%. So hot is better, but still not good enough. The house always wins.</p>

<p>so really betting on hot percentage wise would  get you further &gt;_&lt;</p>

You bet on either a hot coloured flower or a cold coloured flower to be planted. Red orange yellow being hot, and purple blue and mixed purple/blue being cold. mixed red yellow blue is host wins.<br>
Was just wondering if there was a way to tell exactly what colour would be planted each time. After doing some research I saw a few people say that if you plant flowers in a line for 10 or so flowers, write the colours down, and plant them in the exact line you did previous it’ll be the same each time. But I tested it and although its similar, the pattern is over thrown.<br>

<p>So the better picks a hot (red, orange, yellow) or cold (purple, blue, purple-mix). If the colour planted is not the type that the better picked the better loses. If the colour planted is a yellow-blue-red mixed flower, the better instantly loses. If the colour planted is white/black, another flower is planted?</p>
<p>If this is true, i’ll set up a simulation.<br>
[/quote]<br>
What’s the point in doing a simulation? Unless you have the actual game code which decides on the flower that is planted, your odds are potentially very wrong.[/quote]<br>
well we’re all assuming it’s random and we know the odds of planting each flower (with a big sample size i might add), so what’s the issue? only thing i could think of is what they use to generate the ‘random’ number.</p>

              <p>couldn’t he simulate it on the game? run several characters planting flowers then pick them up and bank and repeat until a large sample is obtained then compare the characters? the script would be fairly trivial to make.</p>
