    <title>Server online For others,but only when im on? :\</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-online-for-others-but-only-when-im-on/249380</link>
    <description>a few weeks back i made a server for me and friends to play on
(well,made it,but didn&#39;t start changing things up till a few days ago)
anyway,it lets them go online,with the exception that i am logged in.
meaning if i&#39;m not logged in (or have recently logged in in the passed,20 minutes or so)
so if they wanted to play well i was away,i will need to keep an account logged in,auto clicking or whatever i have to do to keep it logged in,so they can log in/out.
i&#39;ve tried the auto restarter to go off every now and then (well, different ones)
and once they restart it will not let them log in until i have logged in
but,if i were to logg out,and they were playing and dissconnected they wouldnt be able to get back on

(seems to be going in circles so ill stop there)

first i thought it could have been something coded in or something,but another friend uses the same source,and it doesnt do that for him
source:delta


anyone know a fix for this?

could it be that i did something wrong when portforwarding,or accepting it through on firewall?</description>

              <p>hmm, did you do any coding to it? if you did you prolly messed it up a little and need to download the source and start all over again…</p>
<p>if you didnt, try another source and see if it works</p>
<p>nothing much else to say</p>
