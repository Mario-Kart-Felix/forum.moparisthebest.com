What can you do online?
Pvm and pvp.
1.Items needed are spread through the server and are mostly obtainable from doing slayer, bossing and random npcs.
Some npcs require certain stats to be able to kill. You can also do clue scrolls which give you random items which will aid you in kill high leverl monsters or pvp.lls

Clue scroll Drop table:
Easy: All slayer npcs, rock crabs, giant rock crabs etc
Medium: Some bosses some npcs
Hard: All bosses and some slayer npcs
It spread...
Do slayer and you&#39;re bound 2 get one :)

Random pk points from bosses:
Nex: 20

Free for all events, added ffa into the server so whenever there are many people that are pking i can turn ffa on and people will have way more fun pking.

Ingame highscores for those people that like to train to become the best.
Advanced econemy, and im serious, the eco is just sick compared to any other server, just picture this: ags is 10mil to the general store and that is the item with the most value, so yeah... 
But that dosent make its harder to make money, it only depends if you dont know anything about a rsps or not.

<p>Alright use this forums for now.<br>
