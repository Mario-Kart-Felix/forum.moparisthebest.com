    <title>Npc chat bug with bsh system</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-chat-bug-with-bsh-system/548533</link>
    <description>If I talk to a npc that is scripted with bsh, then talk to another npc that is scripted with bsh, instead of the second npc talking with his script, the first npc is talking with the second bsh script.

for example:

I talk to ned, then i go talk to aggie, instead it being aggie saying her script, ned is saying aggie&#39;s script.

If I do a logout in between talking to npc&#39;s it refreshes it and fixes it.
Anyone else notice they have this bug as well? Any fixes? I&#39;ve search for possible fixes for it but do not see any topics up for this yet.</description>

              <p>i went through a few sources that have the bsh system implemented in it and cannot find anything else to add to it that I already havent :\ unless those sources had the same problem as well and just never noticed it. Im sure rsca would have noticed and fixed it though</p>
