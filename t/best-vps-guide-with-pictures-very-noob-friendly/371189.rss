    <title>Best VPS guide with pictures. VERY NOOB FRIENDLY!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/best-vps-guide-with-pictures-very-noob-friendly/371189</link>
    <description>[center][size=24pt][b][u]This is my guide, and i do not give permission for anyone else to take my work[/u][/b].[/size][/center]

[center][u][size=12pt]Upload your server files to a file hosting website.[/size][/u][/center]
[center][u]Before you get a VPS you must understand that it is basically another computer that is on all the time, hosting your Private Runescape Server. Also they do cost money and you&#39;re not going to get one for a couple of dollars or pounds a month.[/u][/center]
[center]I didnt understand the guides that i could find before my VPS. So here is a great tutorial.
[b]Firstly[/b], you need a vps. I recommend [url=http://www.elastichosts.com]elastic hosts[/url].
They are [u]very helpful[/u], and [u]extremely quick[/u] on sending your vps details. (Username, password...)
[u]You do not have to use this host![/u]
[b]Secondly[/b], Getting your VPS Sorted. Once you have logged in with your details  (you will get emailed your details.)
You will come to this page.
[IMG]http://i56.tinypic.com/rshgr6.png[/img]
But it wont have my details obviously. What you will want to do is Click on edit, 
and click on the little arrow for the drop down box (The Drives.)
Select windows Web Server 2008 Trial install CD.
Then just click Start. That will start your server but it will not work just yet.
then at the right side of the page, Add server or drive.
Select drive only. Just put the name as the name of your server, you can leave the image
and make the size 15GB. Select add. You will come to this page. 
[IMG]http://i55.tinypic.com/2gxp7gy.png[/img] 
Now you need to edit your Server again so, hit Hard power off, then,
edit then, you need to click the arrow again for the drop down box. And select
your drive, it will be at the bottom, (the name of your server). You must have your drive (the name of your server) in the first box with the media type Disk and Windows Web Server 2008 in the second box with the media type Cdrom. This is what it should look like. 
[IMG]http://i54.tinypic.com/2ufvm79.png[/img]

The ide:0:1 is the one you need your drive in. Hit start and you&#39;re done on the control panel.
Now, you dont have to but, personally, i recommend this step.
[url=http://www.realvnc.com/products/download.html]Download this[/url]
It is called VNC viewer, it allows you to view your server, instead of using
remote desktop connection. Install it and open it up. It will ask you for you ip address,
Put the one that Elastic hosts gave you. It is on your control panel, (on elastic hosts site.)
Then it will ask you for your password, put the one that elastic hosts gave you, once again,
It is on your control panel, (on elastic hosts site). It should then show this screen.
[IMG]http://i53.tinypic.com/9ps18m.png[/img] 
Enter your details and it will take you to the next page. Hit install now.
It will ask you for a product activation code, click next.
When your on the next screen it will ask you what edition of windows that you purchased.
Click the Windows Web Server 2008 server core installation. After you have gone through the few simple things, it will say where do you want to install windows and it should have
something saying disk 0 unallocated space, select that, it will start installing. After installation, it will restart and the &quot;computer&quot; will start up.
When it starts up, Go on the internet (on your server) and type the download link in for your server files, once you have your server files. Do you what you would do to get your server online on your proper computer, but you do not have to port forward (it is already done for you.)

So there you go your guide to a vps. If you need anyhelp just pm me and ill come on team viewer and do it for you.

              <p>[center][size=24pt]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">This is my guide, and i do not give permission for anyone else to take my work</span></span>.[/size][/center]</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-u">[size=12pt]Upload your server files to a file hosting website.[/size]</span>[/center]<br>
[center]<span class="bbcode-u">Before you get a VPS you must understand that it is basically another computer that is on all the time, hosting your Private Runescape Server. Also they do cost money and you’re not going to get one for a couple of dollars or pounds a month.</span>[/center]<br>
[center]I didnt understand the guides that i could find before my VPS. So here is a great tutorial.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Firstly</span>, you need a vps. I recommend <a href="http://www.elastichosts.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">elastic hosts</a>.<br>
They are <span class="bbcode-u">very helpful</span>, and <span class="bbcode-u">extremely quick</span> on sending your vps details. (Username, password…)<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">You do not have to use this host!</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Secondly</span>, Getting your VPS Sorted. Once you have logged in with your details  (you will get emailed your details.)<br>
You will come to this page.<br>
<img src="http://i56.tinypic.com/rshgr6.png" alt width="640" height="390"><br>
But it wont have my details obviously. What you will want to do is Click on edit,<br>
and click on the little arrow for the drop down box (The Drives.)<br>
Select windows Web Server 2008 Trial install CD.<br>
Then just click Start. That will start your server but it will not work just yet.<br>
then at the right side of the page, Add server or drive.<br>
Select drive only. Just put the name as the name of your server, you can leave the image<br>
and make the size 15GB. Select add. You will come to this page.<br>
<img src="http://i55.tinypic.com/2gxp7gy.png" alt width="640" height="389"><br>
Now you need to edit your Server again so, hit Hard power off, then,<br>
edit then, you need to click the arrow again for the drop down box. And select<br>
your drive, it will be at the bottom, (the name of your server). You must have your drive (the name of your server) in the first box with the media type Disk and Windows Web Server 2008 in the second box with the media type Cdrom. This is what it should look like.<br>
<img src="http://i54.tinypic.com/2ufvm79.png" alt width="140" height="120"></p>
<p>The ide:0:1 is the one you need your drive in. Hit start and you’re done on the control panel.<br>
Now, you dont have to but, personally, i recommend this step.<br>
<a href="http://www.realvnc.com/products/download.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Download this</a><br>
It is called VNC viewer, it allows you to view your server, instead of using<br>
remote desktop connection. Install it and open it up. It will ask you for you ip address,<br>
Put the one that Elastic hosts gave you. It is on your control panel, (on elastic hosts site.)<br>
Then it will ask you for your password, put the one that elastic hosts gave you, once again,<br>
It is on your control panel, (on elastic hosts site). It should then show this screen.<br>
<img src="http://i53.tinypic.com/9ps18m.png" alt width="639" height="499"><br>
Enter your details and it will take you to the next page. Hit install now.<br>
It will ask you for a product activation code, click next.<br>
When your on the next screen it will ask you what edition of windows that you purchased.<br>
Click the Windows Web Server 2008 server core installation. After you have gone through the few simple things, it will say where do you want to install windows and it should have<br>
something saying disk 0 unallocated space, select that, it will start installing. After installation, it will restart and the “computer” will start up.<br>
When it starts up, Go on the internet (on your server) and type the download link in for your server files, once you have your server files. Do you what you would do to get your server online on your proper computer, but you do not have to port forward (it is already done for you.)</p>
<p>So there you go your guide to a vps. If you need anyhelp just pm me and ill come on team viewer and do it for you.<br>
