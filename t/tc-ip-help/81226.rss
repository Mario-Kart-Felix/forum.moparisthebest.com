    <title>TC/IP Help</title>

    <description>Hey, im new to servers and everything, ive read around, I know people are tired of noobs, like me asking for server help, but heres MY problem

I created a server using the server builder stickied.

The only  reason i did this was because when i try to log in to my router, i enter my router ip into IE and it does not go to the router page liek ive seen. I have a wireless internet connection, and SBC DSL, when i enter the given linksys address (not the one shown in my internet connection) it comes up with the sbc page, where there are modem options. But none however, have a field for creating a new TC/IP


help?
