              <p>[quote=“ox random xi, post:2, topic:356963”]Name: Alex</p>
<p>Position wanted: Moderator/Administrator</p>
<p>Any experience: I’ve been staff over 100 + servers, and owned 5 that where successful in their days. My main positions in servers where usually Staff Manager, picking and handling the staff so the owner could code and keep to himself. I’ve also managed forum staff and handling. I’ve coded 317’s before, that’s where my own experience has come from. I started around summer of '07, learning java from just field work of downloading a blank source and figuring out how to add stuff, ect. Then once 508’s came out, I started the same thing only using bases and having co-coders. Just recently I’ve started on 614 coding, even though it’s impossible for me.</p>
<p>Why should we pick you: I’m dedicated to my work, active constantly. Even with school, I would still monitor the forums and anything you asked me via Phone. I respect everyone the same, as if a normal player was a owner. I try my best to be presentable and nice to everyone around me and I’ve been told by recent staff managers that I am a well trained people person and can adapt to the people’s need.</p>
<p>Time zone/ Country: My time zone is GMT -05, I live in the East Coast of the United States.[/quote]</p>
<p>Can you follow instructions? If not I really have no interest in having you on the team. Where is this post does it say to post an application? Yes on our forums. There is a format there and it explains everything else. Pay attention please.</p>
