    <title>1 computer, 3 outputs?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/1-computer-3-outputs/298859</link>
    <description>I was wondering, since im building my own computer.

Is it possible to have 

1 computer hook to 3 monitors, 3 keyboards, and 3 mouses, and speakers. 

and all of it run off one computer?

Was thinking a quad could do the trick.

Is there any programs that do this? Or what would i need to set this baby up.
[b]
I have 7 people in my family so 3 outputs would be nice and alot cheaper[/b]</description>

<p>I was talking about doing this under Linux, which was made to run multiple users at the same time and is not susceptible to viruses or anything like that.  Certainly it would be much more risky to run this set up with 3rd party software that hacks into the already unstable and not suited for more than one user windows kernel to let this happen than to run it in an environment that supports this kind of thing like linux.

<p>You just set up 3 (or however many you want) different X servers (which is a common thing with more than one screen) but the only difference is you change their input devices to the different keyboards and mice.  And there can use it like 3 different computers at once.<br>

At my school, I installed something that you put a chip into the pci slot, and its basically 3 or 4 Ethernet ports and from there you put a Ethernet cable into some small box, and from the box you put a Monitor, Speakers, and keyboard and mouse and they all act like <span class="bbcode-b">seperate</span> machines. I’ll try to get the name for you.<br>
[/quote]<br>
That is what they have at my school. But mainly it is just one screen to a machine.[/quote]Well you have to have a fairly well processor to get it running good. So maybe they wanted to keep it down a bit :S?</p>

<p>and then his little sister goes on some online barbie flash game and knocks out 2 cores, his mother downloads a virus and infects you all, his dad decides to play some online poker, in the middle of winning 100k at a tournament, then his little brother gets the computer frozen, when the ram stick fails, thats everyone in the family with no computer.</p>
<p>it really won’t be what he’s going to expect, i could understand 2 brothers in the same room sharing it, that might end up smooth, but a family will get out of hand. Theres so many equations where things are gonna get uncomfortable.<br>

<p>I was talking about doing this under Linux, which was made to run multiple users at the same time and is not susceptible to viruses or anything like that.  Certainly it would be much more risky to run this set up with 3rd party software that hacks into the already unstable and not suited for more than one user windows kernel to let this happen than to run it in an environment that supports this kind of thing like linux.  I would never try this on windows.[/quote]<br>
hmm mopar whats your idea (in detail please)<br>
i was looking into doing this just for web browsing and that sort of thing</p>

<p>I disagree.  As long as he doesn’t try anything that heavily relies on the video card on all 3 screens at once I think he will be perfectly fine.  As RIP said, as long as you don’t try to play crysis with your family members you will be fine.<br>

and then his little sister goes on some online barbie flash game and knocks out 2 cores, his mother downloads a virus and infects you all, his dad decides to play some online poker, in the middle of winning 100k at a tournament, then his little brother gets the computer frozen, when the ram stick fails, thats everyone in the family with no computer.</p>
<p>it really won’t be what he’s going to expect, i could understand 2 brothers in the same room sharing it, that might end up smooth, but a family will get out of hand. Theres so many equations where things are gonna get uncomfortable.[/quote]</p>
<p>I was talking about doing this under Linux, which was made to run multiple users at the same time and is not susceptible to viruses or anything like that.  Certainly it would be much more risky to run this set up with 3rd party software that hacks into the already unstable and not suited for more than one user windows kernel to let this happen than to run it in an environment that supports this kind of thing like linux.  I would never try this on windows.</p>

i highly go against this idea, your not going to get it set up and perform to what you’d expect. if you even get it set up that is.<br>
