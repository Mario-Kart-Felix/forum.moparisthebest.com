    <title>Who do you side with on the US 2012 election?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/who-do-you-side-with-on-the-us-2012-election/454429</link>
    <description>Thanks to meiscooldude. http://www.isidewith.com

Post your results and we can discuss choices. After a few attempts where some answers were entered wrong, I got a whopping 92% sided with Jill Stein up from 85%. It&#39;s interesting because I got 5% with Mitt before, but now it&#39;s 15%. http://www.isidewith.com/results/47036189

Obviously I am not American and I&#39;m sure a few people here are going to take the test aren&#39;t going to be American but it&#39;s an interesting thought experiment nonetheless. 

I will point out that the results are a little off, for example

Do you support affirmative action programs?
Mitt Romney: No
Your similar answer: No, but we should offer social programs to address poverty regardless of race or ethnicity

I am against affirmative action programs but am for programs that function exactly the same regardless of race or ethnicity, some would argue that this isn&#39;t necessarily affirmative action but I&#39;m still for it, while Mitt is not, yet it&#39;s an issue we &quot;side on&quot;.</description>

<p>Edit. A woman’s choice vs A possible person’s life. hmm so hard to choose. You’ve already been born, so thanks for sharing your ‘knowledge’.</p>

</aside>
<p>yes, I have already been born, that’s a very acute observation you have made</p>
<p>as I stated, before 28 weeks there is absolutely no brain function responsible for pain in foetuses, there is no higher brain functions at all, at 28 weeks in all the foetus can do is maybe move limbs involuntarily, this is in stark contrast to say a foetus at 31 weeks which is nearly fully developed, and a foetus at 35 weeks which for all intents and purposes is fully developed and if born this early (usual pregnancy is 40-41 weeks) can survive</p>
<p>abortions are usually forbidden past 20-24-26-28 weeks and when they aren’t forbidden it’s VERY rare that they do occur, and usually for strictly medial reasons (mothers still die during childbirth), something that is interesting is that the majority of stillbirths occur with foetuses aged around 28 weeks or beyond, where if a foetus is birthed alive at that age the survival rare is ridiculously high</p>
<p>but what am I getting at? you’re comparing the mother (a fully developed member of society with a good life expectancy rate) to an embryo or foetus that isn’t a fully developed member of society and still has a relatively high chance of dying, looking at it from a cost:benefit analysis the mothers choice is always more valuable, looking at it from a potential for harm standpoint, the mothers choice is always more valuable</p>
<p>but I’ll tell you what, once poverty and child abuse are eliminated, once the chances of mothers dying in birth are eliminated, once contraceptives are 100% successful and non-invasive and once rape and incest never occur, THEN you may have a leg to stand on with “abortion should be illegal”, until then however you’re only forcing mothers to carry a child to term where in the cases of mothers needing an abortion are the ones that may not be able to provide a decent quality of life for that child</p>
<p>and of course, it’s a proven fact that if there’s no <span class="bbcode-b">safe</span> and <span class="bbcode-b">legal</span> option for abortion people WILL resort to getting dangerous illegal abortions where the chances of the person performing the abortion caring about not aborting past 3rd trimester etc are non existent, where you’re risking the mothers life and a botched birth because of a badly performed abortion that could have been performed legally and in a medically safe manner</p>

</aside>
<p>and what about the woman’s right to life? you’re perfectly fine condemning a woman to death (women STILL DIE DURING CHILDBIRTH) and you’re condemning a child to a possible life of poverty and abuse just because the woman is carrying an embryo or a foetus that MIGHT successfully produce a child?</p>
<p>and please, an embryos and foetus are not miniature children, an embryo is an embryo and a foetus is a foetus and a foetus is not fully developed until at least 35 weeks into the pregnancy</p>

</aside>
<p>no one’s saying embryos and foetuses aren’t human beings, they’re saying that foetuses are not fully developed human beings and DO NOT have a 100% chance to produce a living, healthy baby</p>
<p>let’s consider for a minute that we change the subject from foetuses to babies after birth, absolutely NO ONE (here at least) arguing for abortion WOULD EVER CONDONE KILLING A BABY, EVER, but we are not talking about babies we are talking about undeveloped foetuses that feel no pain, have no higher brain functions and have NOT had 14+ successful years from birth</p>

<p>so instead of aborting an embryo or a foetus, you instead want to bring a baby into a possibly REALLY SHITTY situation because it’s “the right thing to do” except you don’t give a shit about the right thing to do, you just don’t like the fact people that don’t follow your religion the exact same way you do get to make choices that you don’t</p>
<p>but to address some of your retardness, “science” doesn’t give any option you fucking retard science is a way of explaining and predicting natural phenomenon based on observed natural laws, science tells us that no, an embryo is not a fully developed human being in miniature, science tells us that foetuses do not have the parts of the brain to feel pain before 28 weeks, or 6 months into pregnancy, doctors using this knowledge understand that giving an abortion (which are USUALLY done WELL BEFORE 6 MONTHS) is almost always guaranteed to cause less harm and suffering than forcing mothers to give birth to a FUCKING BABY who may not be financially or emotionally supported who may be born into poverty and abuse</p>
<p>oh, and evolution has absolutely NOTHING to do with abortion, neither does satanism, atheism sure does those dead foetuses are fucking delicious[/quote]<br>
^ this. merely justifies what i said.</p>
<p>Edit. A woman’s choice vs A possible person’s life. hmm so hard to choose. You’ve already been born, so thanks for sharing your ‘knowledge’.</p>

It was sarcasm. The joke being that I want the human fetuses dead, but I also don’t want to give women a choice.</p>

<p>Oh definitely, I’m not for US intervention unless it’s a multinational effort and done properly (arguably: Libya), I was answering in the more general sense.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Libya isn’t a good example. I do not believe that intervention happened by good intent. Libya was an oil rich secular country with good living standard, not likely that a big enough group of rebels appeared that justifies an intervention. Gaddafi only did what other countries would do to fight off terrorists. The west loved him before (Apart from the Lockerbie terrorism). It seems like he got the Hussein treatment.[/quote]</p>
<p>Definitely was a bad example I just lacked any others to give.</p>
