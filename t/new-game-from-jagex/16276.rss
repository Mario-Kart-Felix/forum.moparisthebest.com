    <description>Looking at the Jagex corporate site, I noticed an opening for a &quot;Content Developer&quot; -

&lt;blockquote&gt;Content Developer
Jagex Ltd, developer and publisher of the MMORPG adventure game RuneScape, is looking for imaginative people to join the content development team on a permanent basis. Your role will primarily be to build creatures, shape virtual worlds, design quests and storylines for our new, undisclosed game.

Must have:

    * Previously written quests or storylines for RPG or novels
    * Good programming skills
    * Good creative writing skills and imaginative storyline ideas
    * Experience of working to deadlines
    * Passion for games
    * Good communication skills, able to make part of a very exciting team

Also useful:

    * A computer science degree is a plus but not essential if good programming skills can be demonstrated
    * Anime, graphic novels and general sci-fi interest

Candidates must provide a CV with examples of previous creative work (either emailed or a website link).

Salary: £18-22k depending on experience, annual bonus, health care, gym membership and other benefits.

Location: Cambridge. Candidates must be able to work in Cambridge or to re-locate.

To apply: Send your CV (as Word document) with covering letter to:

We will contact you directly if we wish to proceed further with your application. Interviews will be held in the Cambridge office.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If you didn&#39;t catch it the first time through:

[b]Your role will primarily be to build creatures, shape virtual worlds, design quests and storylines for our new, undisclosed game.[/b]

They also have more openings for team leaders, programmers, animators, recruiters, etc. than usual - looks like they&#39;re putting together a team for an entirely new branch of Jagex, honestly.

Anyone know more?</description>

              <p>Yes as Mopar said this was posted way before in Kaitnieks where people had false fanatasies about getting a job there and sneaking info out, I think it was eXemplar or someone.</p>
<p>I don’t believe it would be a new game, why would they abandon RuneScape, it is pretty successful. If anything they might shut down RS and use the same ideal for a new game with a different storyline, perhaps a more wider world with more skills techniques races etc, like WoW.</p>
<p>And if they are I can’t wait to see those High Score fags kill themselves <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
