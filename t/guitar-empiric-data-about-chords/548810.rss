    <title>Guitar - Empiric Data about Chords</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/guitar-empiric-data-about-chords/548810</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve created a program that can generate guitar sound. It can play both open string and fretted notes. Not to mention quite a few chords.

So, does anyone here have any empiric data about what guitar chords work together? Which ones works in minor and which works in major scales?</description>

              <p>Thank you for your information! Not sure if I got it all, but whatever. Anyhow, my “music” can be heard from here: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/joergen_lundgren/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://soundcloud.com/joergen_lundgren/</a></p>
<p>The “song” that can currently be heard is made using an electric guitar playing a few random chords. I had that song prior to asking the question on here, but who really cares? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Edit: The electric guitar is emulated. It is not real.</p>

              <p>It sounds like you’re just asking for chord progressions. All a chord progression is is choosing bass notes and going up +2 notes in the key for a third (major or minor), then +2 for a fifth (“power” chord without the octave note), then sometimes +2 (7th). +1 From here is just the root note, and sure you can have a 4th in there but it’s just a fifth with an octave-up root note. Any other notes made with the bass note for a chord will likely sound like garbage and any musician willing to argue probably listens to Tool and can only write music that sounds listenable on a piano. The only way to avoid the ear-wrenching sound of a 7th chord and even sometimes worse is to play these close notes with a higher octave, which abuses the fact that they don’t actually mix but we can’t tell as easily as we can with low notes.</p>
<p>All humor and jokes aside, that’s really all there is to it. You can get fancy and force the 3rd that should be a minor to be a major, for example, which is called an accidental (any note out of key is an accidental, although some musicians will probably argue that this isn’t the exact correct technical definition), but if you wanna be the copy-paste musician, don’t worry about these.</p>
<p>To figure out if a 3rd should make it a major or minor chord, it depends on the root note and the scale. You increment in semitones. In a major scale, it’s 0-2-4-5-7-9-11-12 and in a minor scale, 0-2-3-5-7-8-10-12. You can mix these as well to get like a blues scale, or a “scary” scale.</p>
<p>There you go. Super simple musical theory that anyone with a piano can sit down and figure out. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
