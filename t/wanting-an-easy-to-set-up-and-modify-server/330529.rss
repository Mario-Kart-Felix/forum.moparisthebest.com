    <description>
I&#39;ve never made a server in my life and I&#39;ve been struggling to figure it out how to modify and set up servers so I can make one of my own. Would you give me any kind of source &amp; client 306, 508, 562 that is easy to deal with.

I&#39;ve figured out the problem with the run and compile for the 562 but I&#39;m stuck on how to modify it.
If you give me any other type with the run and compile problem, I have no idea how to fix it and it get&#39;s on my nerves

I don&#39;t want to deal with stuff like this.............

@echo off
title rs2hd framework
java -Xmx1024m -classpath bin;deps/jython.jar;deps/log4j-1.2.15.jar;deps/mina-core-1.1.7.jar;deps/slf4j-api-1.5.3.jar;deps/slf4j-log4j12-1.5.3.jar;deps/xpp3-1.1.4c.jar;deps/xstream-1.3.1-20081003.103259-2.jar com.rs2hd.Main
pause

Only to change it to something like this just to get it working........

@echo off
title rs2hd framework
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_17\bin\java.exe&quot; -Xmx1024m -classpath bin;deps/jython.jar;deps/log4j-1.2.15.jar;deps/mina-core-1.1.7.jar;deps/slf4j-api-1.5.3.jar;deps/slf4j-log4j12-1.5.3.jar;deps/xpp3-1.1.4c.jar;deps/xstream-1.3.1-20081003.103259-2.jar com.rs2hd.Main
pause

The only thing I figured out after dealing with that is how to make the character become mod and spawn npcs, that doesn&#39;t really help much when your trying to make yourself a server.....</description>

              <p>yeah 317’s are really really easy, I only just started 4 days ago and I’ve managed it easily, I suggest pr0digyscape, because it already has most of the required features (but there’s still a lot that you can do  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> )</p>

              <p>Your pretty much saying you want to have your own server but then your saying you don’t want to get involved with the tricky things, go into server downloads and server tutorials and find a 317 since they’re easy to edit and idiot proof. Tutorial section contains some useful things about Java, conventions etc. No one can give you a compiler that’s going to work for you unless you play around with the environmental variables which there’s a tut in the tutorial section for that too. Here’s a compiler I use and will work if you set up your <span class="bbcode-b">environmental variables</span> correctly.</p>
<p><code>@echo off
if exist "%programfiles%\Java" (call :compile "%programfiles%\Java\") else (goto error)
:compile
for /D %%x in ("%~1jdk*") do (set p="%%~x\bin\javac.exe")
if defined p (%p% -cp . *.java)
if defined p (goto end)
:error
echo You do not have Java installed. Please download it at the site that is about to load.
"%programfiles%\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
:end
echo Finished!
pause
exit</code></p>
<p>If you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to PM me.</p>
