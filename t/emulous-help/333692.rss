    <description>I have emulous 1.7 downloaded, and have come up against one problem I do not even know how to start to fix.  If you open up the bank, it gives a T2 error and closes.  No matter what client you are using.  I have tried, mopar, and downloaded over 10 clients and none seem to work.  I think T2 is caused from a interface missing, but how do I fix this?
