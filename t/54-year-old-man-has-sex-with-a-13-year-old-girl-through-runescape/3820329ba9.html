Then her mother should have been a responsible adult and gotten someone to watch her, its that simple. Please, I know how people are in Detroit (as that is where my aunt was killed). They mostly irresponsible, and slow. It took the police 2 and a half hours to drive 3 minutes down the road where my aunt was killed in a car accident. They then proceded to mark her as a ‘Jane Doe’, and the only reason she was found was because of our missing persons report. Please, don’t let that mothers “2-3 jobs” as an excuse hold up. I stil blame the parents, as they STILL could have done something.</p>

Uncles friend has an apartment, $500 with utilities, all they gotta buy is the food/drinks, and whatever they need. I work for $40 a day and seem to make enough to finance a home (and stay ahead on payments). I am sure she could do something if she is working 2-3 jobs. Figure, i’ll do some math for you.</p>
<p>Lets say she works 2 jobs, each on adverage of 25 hours a week (50 hours in total), at, lets guess at minimum wage ($7.50 an hour). This means, her net income per week is $375 even. Lets take out, lets say 15% for income tax, leaving her with $318.75. This is more than I make per week, and if I was able to buy a motorcycle, and truck, my dad a 4-wheeler, and even myself a new laptop, I think she can offored the spare money (or even find family?) that can babysit.</p>

<p>Lets say she works 2 jobs, each on adverage of 25 hours a week (50 hours in total), at, lets guess at minimum wage ($7.50 an hour). This means, her net income per week is $375 even.

Then how is it my mother supported herself and me back when she was 24 (single mother), had a trailer, paid for the utilities, a babysitter and all, on only minimum wage ($5 or something like that at the time), and still walk out fine. Its the fact that she was good with the money. She worked a burger king, and ended up doing good enough to get promoted into the Manger position (don’t know the wages).</p>
<p>The women in Detroit doesn’t need her internet, that would save money right there. She doesn’t need the computer if she has to work that many jobs, more money saved on electrical. There is something more going on, rather than a 13 year old child. You need to realize there are expenses she is paying, that could easily go over into a babysitter. Clothes? You can just as easily go to a GoodWill or Salvation Army to get cheap clothes. I admit, back when I was broke for like 2-3 months, I was buying my electonics and stuff at GoodWill, since they got a shipment in ever Wednesday of things from Target. Trust me, the women has more going on the just the child to be working 2-3 jobs.</p>
