    <description>I added noted rock tails to my dspk server, but when I bank them or take them out of bank it still appears as noted rocktails, how can I make a unnoted version of this?</description>

<p>You need to make sure that the rocktails are both the same thing, right now you server thinks they are 2 completely different models, so make sure your server sees that they are both considered rocktails (un-noted)</p>

<p>Or instead of thinking of the most complex answer…</p>
<p>Chances are, you don’t have the “unnoted” id in the server. So when you deposit/withdraw it doesn’t switch it to the correct version.</p>
