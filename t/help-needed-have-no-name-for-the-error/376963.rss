    <title>Help needed (have no name for the error)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-needed-have-no-name-for-the-error/376963</link>
    <description>Well, I have this classic error many get these days... I can login to my server using my portforwarded ip. I have correctly opened the port on my router and enabled it on my firewall.
But of course... no1 else can login.

Actually, it worked fine until I started on a new project, so I bet it&#39;s server-sided.
If it&#39;s not, lock or move it if you must.

I do not see a reason for pics, as I know I portforwarded it right, as I no how 2 PF.
But, if you need a pic, tell me what you need a pic of, and I&#39;ll try to get it.</description>
