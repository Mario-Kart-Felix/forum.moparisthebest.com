    <description>[center][b][size=48pt]Jasons 507[/size][/b][/center]

[center][size=8pt][u]Okay the features of this server include[u][/u][/size]
[center][i][/center]

[ul][li]All 24 skills working[/li]
[li]Perfect combat[/li]
[li]custom client[/li]
[li]pvp amour[/li] 
[li] and so much more[/li][/ul]


[b][center][size=18pt][i]A little about me[/i][/size][/center]
[left][size=8pt]I am 15, I am pretty good at coding this is a 508 server but I decided to call it a 507. (I don&#39;t know why. I was drawing little cartoons and logos and came up with this really cool looking &quot;507&quot; logo thingy)I have been coding Java since April of this year. I started on 317&#39;s got kinda bored with those wanted better graphics so moved on.I have played around with 508&#39;s for just a little while from 317 I went to 562. I made a pretty good 562 but decided it wasn&#39;t good enough to release. Now I have been working on this 508 for 2 days. This is Berky&#39;s 508, but i took some things from Davidi2&#39;s DavidScape.(In my opinion David is the best 508 coder out there, so good in fact it would take ages to totally erase his name from the server. That&#39;s why I&#39;m taking what I like from his server and just adding it to the berky source. Creds to David and Berky and me.[/size][/left]

[center][size=24pt][u]Why our server will succeed?[/u][/size][/center]
[left][size=10pt]Simple fact is is that you don&#39;t need the &quot;gratest&quot; server to have a great one look at crisisx it sucks very plain Delta source no offense crisis. Our server however will be &quot;great&quot;. We are going to Have friendly staff, active forums, and updates. We will provide 24/7 uptime for the server for all those people who are so addicted to RSPS they can&#39;t sleep.[/size][/left]

[center][u][size=36pt]Now what I need[/size][/u][/center]

[li]I need 1 or 2 beta testers[/li]
[li]and finally I need a hoster must be 24/7 just long enough till we get off the ground and can get a VPS.[/li]
[li]I might need a 2nd coder ( someone who knows what there doing)[/li][/list]

[center][b][size=22pt]The rewards[/size][/b][/center]

Now I really need Ideas so anyone can help with this part please post Ideas Thank you.
If you do apply for a spot please be aware that you&#39;re going to have to be patient with me. I have a Job and takes up most of my time. [were 2nd coder comes in [maybe]]

Okay when you post please use this template...Also for the web-designer please post links and tell me how long you have been making them.  For coder please put how long you have coded java and how long you have been coding 508&#39;s[/ul]
[code]
Name:
Position:
[for website designer]:
[for coder]:
[/code]
For the part that doesn&#39;t apply to you just put N/A example:
[code]Name:Jason

[for website designer]:{links}{99 years!@!@!@!}
[for coder]:n/a
[/code]
[ul]I will ask for your msn and give you mine when i select you for the job.=]

Seeing as this is flaunting my development skills of making a development team topic I think I can post it here. This is just to help people see this because not many people go to the &quot;development teams&quot; category. If you guys really want me to remove this post just say so and I will happily =][/ul]</description>
