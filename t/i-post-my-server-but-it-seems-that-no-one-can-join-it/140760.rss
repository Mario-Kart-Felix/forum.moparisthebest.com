    <description>My server is on the moparscape server status page but it seems like no one can join it.

Any thing?                                      Can someone just try once?

and it says my server is offline. but its not because i type in my ip adress and it lets me in?

If you could help me test it by 192.168.0.103 that would help alot. If it works post here if it doesnt work still post here[br][size=1]Posted on: September 06, 2007, 05:02:18 AM[/size][hr]has it worked for any one?</description>
