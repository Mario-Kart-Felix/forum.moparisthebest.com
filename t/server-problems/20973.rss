    <description>hi, ive just started using these servers ect and to be honest dont really know exactly what im doing.....


i got moparscape 3.1 w. aryan and tried logging on, (it said somthing about hybirdscape being down) so i clicked start server! then logged onto my own server!
i had a little mess around and see what i could do (gving myself Armour) ect and then decided to go explore.. but when i tried opening doors.. they DONT open.... or stealing off stalls or pull leavers....

i was also rather annouyed about my char using the crystal bow as a melee wep!! and i cant seem to use my ancient staff!!

but then.... my server was lagging/crashing and it kicked me off... when i tried to log back on it said &quot;your account is allready logged in, try right now, or make another account&quot;

so coul;d so more experienced server users please tell me what i am doing wrong and how i can make it right ...etc

i want to thank in advance anyone who helps me
