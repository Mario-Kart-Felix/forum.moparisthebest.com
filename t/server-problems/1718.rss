    <description>Hi all

As some of you may know i have released ganderscape lastnight


My server has been crashing alot and getting alot of errors


Im getting a &quot;java  lang out of memory&quot; error which crashes my server

Ontop of that im getting another error that says &quot;client null disconected&quot; 


it mostly happens when someone connects to the server :(


has anyone got a fix?? could you please help me ? it would be aprecieted :) 



the next problem i have is ... well weve started ancients magicks weve put it in the server compiled with no errors


but what seems to happen is we keep getting &quot;you do not have enough runes for this spell&quot; 

even tho we have the runes and the level


If anyone could help us fix these errors i would happily make them a mod on the server if they wished

Thanks
