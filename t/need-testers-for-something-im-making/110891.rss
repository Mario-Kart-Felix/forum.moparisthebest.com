    <description>Hi guys, for the last few days I have been making a forum system, and a server status system, I need a few testers, to find any glitches with it. After I get home from school today, I will intergrate them so that you need to log in to use the status checker.... All testers that join today will get free mod.

www.runescape3.uk.to/status/index.php &lt;--for the status checker

PS: can you also rate from 1-10, and these are my first projects, so please be easy.</description>
