    <description>I&#39;ve made a webclient which runs fine for me and some others, but some people get a white screen and a little red cross saying &quot;error, click for details.&quot; after some searching and experimenting i found that you need JDK to run my webclient. which i figured is why nobody wants or can play my server.

could anybody help me?
i will rep++ for any help</description>
