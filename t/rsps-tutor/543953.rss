    <title>RSPS Tutor</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsps-tutor/543953</link>
    <description>For a couple years I try coding my own rsps and 11 out of the 12 servers I either gave up on or just couldn&#39;t figure out what to do.
The one server I did have that I liked and was going to host was lost in a fatal washing machine accident...  :palm:

But alas I shall not quit!

I was wondering if anyone would be willing to skype with me and teach me how to code a rsps. I&#39;m not completely new to it, but I only know just as much as the avg noob does (adding stuff). 

I want to learn as much as I can about coding; how it works, adding skills, adding minigames, adding quests &lt;--- REALLY WANNA LEARN THAT IN DEPTH BECAUSE I LOVE MAKIGN QUESTS, adding npcs, etc and when I get the hang of it I would hope I can be able to do more advance stuff and add my own items stuff.

So if any generous people out there would be willing to teach me please leave a comment  :D</description>

              <p>No one will sit around and be your tutor, unless you paid. As (like the web guy said) that takes time and dedication. (Also offering or asking for paid services aren’t allowed on these forums).<br>
There are numerous guides to start a server out there, you should be able to at least get one online (locally at minimal).<br>
Sure, what the others have said may seem like direct attacks, but you really do need to learn Java if you even think to get somewhere with a RSPS. And that link tyb gave you ( <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reallybigindex.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reallybigindex.html</a> ) is where you’ll get the best info on Java.</p>
<p>I can help you here and there, but I will not be there to serve you on your every need, nor will I always be the nicest (I have a reputation for being an asshole, and I don’t really care otherwise).<br>
My skype is in my profile, it’s up to you to find it and add me (It’s your first quest, figure it out <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> ).</p>
<p>Good luck on your RSPS adventures.</p>
<p>P.S: You said you love to make quests, that sounds like you’d be better at being an <em>totally forgets the name</em> idea person. Maybe you could get on a dev team as that (Again, totally forgot the name of that position) while others actually develop the content. Just a suggestion.</p>

              <p>It’s pathetic that you guys are seriously coming down this hard on someone who was just looking for help or advice. OP, instead of asking for a tutor, because that would take a lot of time and dedication. Instead, start trying to learn Java on your own. I would recommend starting with private servers, because yes, it is Java. Plus, more than half of the boards on Moparscape are dedicated to RSPS. And most people are always willing to help. Follow a tutorial on how to set up a server, and then you can start tutorials to do various different things until you’re used to the language.</p>
<p>If you’re going to ask for general help, I wouldn’t ask for a tutor. Just ask some people for their Skype in case you get stuck on anything. I’m not the best resource for Java, but I do know some, and the basics of setting up and managing a RSPS. Plus, I can always refer you to someone else if I don’t know the answer.</p>
<p>My Skype: aj.cordio</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/tyb97">@tyb97</a>: Your post was pointless, didn’t answer any of his questions, and was no help. You could have simply (and nicely) told him that there are plenty of resources for learning Java outside of Moparscape.</p>

<p>You don’t need someone experienced to teach you the basic concepts of java. There are plenty of java docs out there and if you can’t understand them then there is also plenty of videos and books that can give you the basic fundamentals of java. After you read those you’ll find it easier to gain even more knowledge on it. I just don’t understand how after two years you haven’t picked up on the basics maybe try using a different base that is programmed well to show you how you should be programming.</p>
