    <title>Life on Mars</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/life-on-mars/157075</link>
    <description>What do you think? Has there ever been life on mars, or is there still?

MY OPINION.
I belive Mars was once like earth. Atmosphere, rivers, mountains. The year would be longer because of its further distance from the sun. I belive something bad happend, eg; Nuclear explosions, natural disasters, OR global warming distroyed the atmospher, wrecking it.
It is selfish to think that we are alone in this universe.</description>

<p>in order to defend Bang Train, he did specify “complex” - his definition of complex appears to be  multicellular with cellular differentiation. I’d say he is right. No complex organism has developed independently in a non oxygen atmosphere. I am not saying a oxygen requiring specie has not developed pre oxygen atmosphere though, some may have by some form of symbiosis.</p>

<p>There are still some really effiecient anaerobic metablosims based on sulphate respiration or DMSO etc e.g. the methanogens.<br>

<p>this is true, but they are still not efficient enough to sustain complex life (like a blue footed booby)</p>

<p>Thats a fair point, and if it still alive there today it must be able to live with a near zero dissolved oxygen environment. All the best organisms dont use oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor.[br][size=1]Posted on: November 05, 2007, 08:47:04 AM[/size][hr][quote=“Bang Train, post:16, topic:157075”][quote author=OnlyOneRule link=topic=214205.msg1869806#msg1869806 date=1194291782]<br>

<p>There are still some really effiecient anaerobic metablosims based on sulphate respiration or DMSO etc e.g. the methanogens.</p>

              <p>id be pretty surprised if there wasnt life on mars tbh, water is a excellent indicator of primitive life e.g nanoarchaeota and other archeal families.
