    <description>Well ever sence the patch 

Hacking has sucked! 

So I&#39;m just going to make a Mini Engine 2.2 Tut :D

1st part :) 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Time to teach  :)   After my teachings, you&#39;re going to be going through Dark Byte&#39;s tutorials.  They will be
comPLETELY different than mine.  Mine are simply multiple choice and answer finding.  You will have to learn
one bitwise operator  :)  I bet you can&#39;t wait.  Yes, that means Binary ;)

We&#39;re starting out with a simple assembly command.  Jmp/Cmp.  This, as they look, mean Jump / Compare.

A conditional jump (You know how you say &#39;Let&#39;s go to Krispy Kreme if they&#39;re open&#39;?  Yeah.  Conditional jump) is
based off of a comparison.  The comparison sets flags (flags can contain true/false, or 1/0 in binary) according 
to
the comparison. 

For instance!:
CMP 50,50

Would set the zero flag to 1, meaning &#39;true.  The result of a subtraction of the two would in fact be zero.&#39;
It would unset the carry flag as 0, meaning &#39;false, if you were to subtract them, the result would not have to carry
over.&#39;  (Kind of like negatives, how you carry through the 0 marker on the number line).
It would unset the sign flag as 0, meaning &#39;false/no, if you subtracted them the result would not be negative.&#39; 
See the relationship between these?  (And see the relationship to their name and what they mean?  Zero -&gt; 
result
was 0,  Carry -&gt; value would carry over, Sign -&gt; is that pesky negative sign present?  =)  )

A conditional jump acts on these flags.

For Instance!:
JE 654321

Would mean &#39;if EQUAL, JUMP to 654321 (See the Jump if Equal in that &#39;JE&#39;?)
Well, jump if equal is the same as jump if zero flag is set (If the subtraction is between to indentical integers, the 
result would be 0, wouldn&#39;t it? =)  )
Therefore, if a comparison before this &#39;JE 654321&#39; would set the Zero flag for it to know if it should jump or not.

An example:
mov eax,50   //Just note that eax is 50.  You can learn other basics in a bit
cmp eax,50
JE 654321

The comparison between eax (50) and 50 would result in the zero flag being set.  After all, 50 - 50 = 0, right?
Therefore:  Upon saying &#39;if equal, jump to 654321&#39;, it would check if the zero flag is set (Jump if Zero flag is set,
remember?).   It would jump  =)

QUIZ:
mov eax,49
cmp eax,51
JNE 654321

Would it jump?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Its yes :o... I would explain..But I&#39;m to lazy :) May do it later



2nd part :) Funnn Binarys  :D...Funnnn


***** Dont try cheating everytime you open the tutorial the codes change!  :|

&lt;blockquote&gt;BINARY!

I&#39;m teaching you how to convert to binary in preparation for the next 1337 step :)

Converting is very simple and often applied to scripts to make them 1337, so I suggest learning bitwise operators if
you plan to make any hacks on your own =D

So I&#39;ll start you out.  First by giving an example conversion (because that is how I learn).

We&#39;re converting from hexadecimal (0-f, which is 0 - 15 in decimal.  hexa &lt;- meaning base of 16)
   5       F        E      7
0101 1111 1110 0111
0101111111100111  &lt;- 5FE7  =)

Interested yet?

In binary, each place left is one power up of two.  Hexadecimal is one digit for every 4 digits.  I&#39;ll show you.

0   1   0   1
8 - 4 - 2 - 1    &lt;- 1 is 2 to the 0th power.  2 is to the 1st, 4 = to the 2nd, 8 = to the 3rd.  8+4+2+1 = 15.  F =)
________     &lt;- ok, so what this shows is that the 4 slow and the 1 slot are ligned up.  So 4 + 1 =  ?
      5             &lt;-  =)

Let&#39;s convert a fairly larger one.  Remember how I said hexadecimal is one digit for every 4 digits of binary? (bits)

Let&#39;s convert 1337, because that is what I&#39;m making you.  (Go talk in binary in school.  You&#39;ll be 5 times as cool)

    1      3       3       7
0001 0011 0011 0111   &lt;- For the first one, we filled the 1 slot.  Then we filled the 2+1 slots, then 2+1 again, then 4+2+1

Now remember, this is in hexadecimal.  Therefore, you&#39;ll see things like this.

  F         0       0       D
1111 0000 0000 1101   // F = 15, and D = 13  (2 letters before 5, so 15 - 2 = 13     =)  )

As you can see, binary is simple addition.  Now.  Time to test you.  Convert the following into binary then click &#39;Submit&#39;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ok... Well it took me a while to understand this .. But the basic knowledge is that each number from 0-9 and A-F have a code
..And I really couldn&#39;t figure this out until I found a site :)


http://www.easycalculation.com/hex-converter.php

My numbers were 2998 so my binary was:

0010 1001 1001 1000 
:D Press next

3rd part

&lt;blockquote&gt;Bitwise Operator:  XOR   -- Written by TheSorc3r3r.  (If you need more help, use CEF to tell me to edit his tut)

But first:  Uzeil&#39;s real-life example! (Because we all love them =)   )
Let&#39;s say you were deciding to go to one of two new restaurants, and yet you didn&#39;t
want to overload yourself on good food.  You just want to go, eat, have a good time,
and come back with a reasonably consistant weight with when you left.

So you would say:  &#39;I&#39;ll go to that restaurant as long as it has chicken or hot buffalo
wings.  Although... I don&#39;t think I want to go if they have both.  I don&#39;t want to end
up buying both just because the other looks too delicious :?  &#39;

Given that perfectly reasonable example(Happens to me all the time), I&#39;ll explain how
it is relevant.  In this case, you are saying that if it doesn&#39;t have either, you definitely
aren&#39;t going.   However, you only want it to have ONE OR THE OTHER. (I only
capitalize words when they are really, REALLY important.  UZEIL for example, should
always be capitalized.  =D )  Xor, the operator (not the mod), does exactly this.  It says
that only if one of the two is true will it allow it in the result.  XOR means &#39;exclusive
OR&#39;.  Meaning it is an or statement (if either one is true, we&#39;re good), but it is exclusive
because it EXCLUDES the &#39;true&#39; in the result if both of them are true.

Now on to the Sorc-a-thon  ;)  :

xor takes two arguments, and compares each bit in the first to each bit in the second. 
If one bit (and one bit only!) is set, then that bit is  set.  
Finally, the result is stored in the first argument.

Have no idea what I just said?  ;) don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll understand soon enough.

If a bit is set, it&#39;s 1.  If a bit is not set, it&#39;s 0.

Example:
603A in binary is:
0110 0000 0011 1010 (if you don&#39;t remember this, re-read the previous step)

0110:  not set, set, set, not set
0000:  not set, not set, not set, not set
0011:  not set, not set, set, set
1010:  set, not set, set, not set

3CC9 is:
0011 1100 1100 1001

0011:  not set, not set, set, set
1100:  set, set, not set, not set
1100:  set, set, not set, not set
1001:  set, not set, not set, set


When xor compares two bits, it sets the bit if only one bit is set.

1	  |0	    |1
_________|________ |__
0                |0               |1
_________|________ |_
1                |1               |0


xor example: 
xor 603A, 3CC9

Convert to binary.
xor 0110 0000 0011 1010, 0011 1100 1100 1001

Line it up, so each bit comparison can be seen.
0110 0000 0011 1010
0011 1100 1100 1001

Perform the operation (let&#39;s look at the leftmost 4 bits).
0110
0011

The two leftmost bits are 0, so neither are set.  So, the resulting bit isn&#39;t set.
0

Then we have 1 and 0 ; only one bit is set, so the resulting bit is set.
1

Then we have 1 and 1 ; both bits are set, so the resulting bit isn&#39;t set.
0

Then we have 0 and 1 ; one bit is set, so resulting bit is set.
1

The result for the first four bits is:
0101

Now, do that for the rest of the bits.
0110 0000 0011 1010
0011 1100 1100 1001
_________________
0101 1100 1111 0011

Our result is 0101 1100 1111 0011, but that&#39;s in binary.  Convert it back to hex (the same way you went to binary, except reversed), 
and 
we get:
5CF3

Therefore:  xor 603A, 3CC9 is 5CF3.

Other bitwise operators work the same way..

XOR - sets the resulting bit if only one bit is set
OR - sets the resulting bit if either bit is set
AND - sets the resulting bit if both bits are set

P.S.:  You don&#39;t have to start with the leftmost bit, but I find it easier.  The choice is yours.

Now, let&#39;s do a larger comparison.

XOR C291E90B, 6264CDBD

1100 0010 1001 0001 1110 1001 0000 1011 
0110 0010 0110 0100 1100 1101 1011 1101
___________________________________
1010 0000 1111 0101 0010 0100 1011 0110

    A      0       F       5       2       4       B       6 

A0F524B6  =)

Time to test you ;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ahhh XORing .. This was easy :)

Ok so Basically you change that Hex number that you have to a binary 

Lets say.. you had my number A229BDBC and C8588DB7

In the first line I would write:

1010 0010 0010 1001 1011 1101 1011 1100

The second line would be:

1100 1000 0101 1000 1000 1101 1011 0111

Alright so you line them up... and the basic part of XORing is that

1 and 1 = 0
0 and 1 = 1
1 and 0 = 1
0 and 0 = 0

Soo with my two lines lined up 

1010 0010 0010 1001 1011 1101 1011 1100

1100 1000 0101 1000 1000 1101 1011 0111
=
0110 1010 0111 0001 0011 0000 0000 1011

Now you hex that and it is..

0110 1010 0111 0001 0011 0000 0000 1011

   6     A      7     1      3       0     0      B

Weee finished XORing :)

O w8 I got a error? O well you get the idea :P You&#39;ll get different numbers anyway..

[size=15pt] We finished UZEIL&#39;s part :) Now DB&#39;s part..You shouldn&#39;t need that much help for this[/size]

**You will need a engine for this *Get CE 5.3

<blockquote>Time to teach  :)   After my teachings, you're going to be going through Dark Byte's tutorials.  They will be
comPLETELY different than mine.  Mine are simply multiple choice and answer finding.  You will have to learn
one bitwise operator  :)  I bet you can't wait.  Yes, that means Binary ;)
<p>We’re starting out with a simple assembly command.  Jmp/Cmp.  This, as they look, mean Jump / Compare.</p>
<p>A conditional jump (You know how you say ‘Let’s go to Krispy Kreme if they’re open’?  Yeah.  Conditional jump) is<br>
based off of a comparison.  The comparison sets flags (flags can contain true/false, or 1/0 in binary) according<br>
to<br>
the comparison.</p>
<p>For instance!:<br>
CMP 50,50</p>
<p>Would set the zero flag to 1, meaning ‘true.  The result of a subtraction of the two would in fact be zero.’<br>
It would unset the carry flag as 0, meaning ‘false, if you were to subtract them, the result would not have to carry<br>
over.’  (Kind of like negatives, how you carry through the 0 marker on the number line).<br>
It would unset the sign flag as 0, meaning ‘false/no, if you subtracted them the result would not be negative.’<br>
See the relationship between these?  (And see the relationship to their name and what they mean?  Zero -&gt;<br>
result<br>
was 0,  Carry -&gt; value would carry over, Sign -&gt; is that pesky negative sign present?  =)  )</p>
<p>A conditional jump acts on these flags.</p>
<p>For Instance!:<br>
JE 654321</p>
<p>Would mean 'if EQUAL, JUMP to 654321 (See the Jump if Equal in that ‘JE’?)<br>
Well, jump if equal is the same as jump if zero flag is set (If the subtraction is between to indentical integers, the<br>
result would be 0, wouldn’t it? =)  )<br>
Therefore, if a comparison before this ‘JE 654321’ would set the Zero flag for it to know if it should jump or not.</p>
<p>An example:<br>
mov eax,50   //Just note that eax is 50.  You can learn other basics in a bit<br>
cmp eax,50<br>
JE 654321</p>
<p>The comparison between eax (50) and 50 would result in the zero flag being set.  After all, 50 - 50 = 0, right?<br>
Therefore:  Upon saying ‘if equal, jump to 654321’, it would check if the zero flag is set (Jump if Zero flag is set,<br>
remember?).   It would jump  =)</p>
<p>QUIZ:<br>
mov eax,49<br>
cmp eax,51<br>
JNE 654321</p>
<p>Would it jump?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its yes :o… I would explain…But I’m to lazy <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> May do it later</p>
<p>2nd part <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Funnn Binarys  :D…Funnnn</p>
<p>***** Dont try cheating everytime you open the tutorial the codes change!  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=6" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<blockquote>BINARY!
<p>I’m teaching you how to convert to binary in preparation for the next 1337 step <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Converting is very simple and often applied to scripts to make them 1337, so I suggest learning bitwise operators if<br>
you plan to make any hacks on your own =D</p>
<p>So I’ll start you out.  First by giving an example conversion (because that is how I learn).</p>
<p>We’re converting from hexadecimal (0-f, which is 0 - 15 in decimal.  hexa &lt;- meaning base of 16)<br>
5       F        E      7<br>
0101 1111 1110 0111<br>
0101111111100111  &lt;- 5FE7  =)</p>
<p>Interested yet?</p>
<p>In binary, each place left is one power up of two.  Hexadecimal is one digit for every 4 digits.  I’ll show you.</p>
<p>0   1   0   1<br>
8 - 4 - 2 - 1    &lt;- 1 is 2 to the 0th power.  2 is to the 1st, 4 = to the 2nd, 8 = to the 3rd.  8+4+2+1 = 15.  F =)<br>
________     &lt;- ok, so what this shows is that the 4 slow and the 1 slot are ligned up.  So 4 + 1 =  ?<br>
5             &lt;-  =)</p>
<p>Let’s convert a fairly larger one.  Remember how I said hexadecimal is one digit for every 4 digits of binary? (bits)</p>
<p>Let’s convert 1337, because that is what I’m making you.  (Go talk in binary in school.  You’ll be 5 times as cool)</p>
<pre><code>1      3       3       7
</code></pre>
<p>0001 0011 0011 0111   &lt;- For the first one, we filled the 1 slot.  Then we filled the 2+1 slots, then 2+1 again, then 4+2+1</p>
<p>Now remember, this is in hexadecimal.  Therefore, you’ll see things like this.</p>
<p>F         0       0       D<br>
1111 0000 0000 1101   // F = 15, and D = 13  (2 letters before 5, so 15 - 2 = 13     =)  )</p>
<p>As you can see, binary is simple addition.  Now.  Time to test you.  Convert the following into binary then click ‘Submit’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok… Well it took me a while to understand this … But the basic knowledge is that each number from 0-9 and A-F have a code<br>
…And I really couldn’t figure this out until I found a site <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><a href="http://www.easycalculation.com/hex-converter.php" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.easycalculation.com/hex-converter.php</a></p>
<p>My numbers were 2998 so my binary was:</p>
<p>0010 1001 1001 1000<br>

<p>3rd part</p>
<blockquote>Bitwise Operator:  XOR   -- Written by TheSorc3r3r.  (If you need more help, use CEF to tell me to edit his tut)
<p>But first:  Uzeil’s real-life example! (Because we all love them =)   )<br>
Let’s say you were deciding to go to one of two new restaurants, and yet you didn’t<br>
want to overload yourself on good food.  You just want to go, eat, have a good time,<br>
and come back with a reasonably consistant weight with when you left.</p>
<p>So you would say:  'I’ll go to that restaurant as long as it has chicken or hot buffalo<br>
wings.  Although… I don’t think I want to go if they have both.  I don’t want to end<br>
up buying both just because the other looks too delicious :?  ’</p>
<p>Given that perfectly reasonable example(Happens to me all the time), I’ll explain how<br>
it is relevant.  In this case, you are saying that if it doesn’t have either, you definitely<br>
aren’t going.   However, you only want it to have ONE OR THE OTHER. (I only<br>
capitalize words when they are really, REALLY important.  UZEIL for example, should<br>
always be capitalized.  =D )  Xor, the operator (not the mod), does exactly this.  It says<br>
that only if one of the two is true will it allow it in the result.  XOR means ‘exclusive<br>
OR’.  Meaning it is an or statement (if either one is true, we’re good), but it is exclusive<br>
because it EXCLUDES the ‘true’ in the result if both of them are true.</p>
<p>Now on to the Sorc-a-thon  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  :</p>
<p>xor takes two arguments, and compares each bit in the first to each bit in the second.<br>
If one bit (and one bit only!) is set, then that bit is  set.<br>
Finally, the result is stored in the first argument.</p>
<p>Have no idea what I just said?  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> don’t worry, you’ll understand soon enough.</p>
<p>If a bit is set, it’s 1.  If a bit is not set, it’s 0.</p>
<p>Example:<br>
603A in binary is:<br>
0110 0000 0011 1010 (if you don’t remember this, re-read the previous step)</p>
<p>0110:  not set, set, set, not set<br>
0000:  not set, not set, not set, not set<br>
0011:  not set, not set, set, set<br>
1010:  set, not set, set, not set</p>
<p>3CC9 is:<br>
0011 1100 1100 1001</p>
<p>0011:  not set, not set, set, set<br>
1100:  set, set, not set, not set<br>
1100:  set, set, not set, not set<br>
1001:  set, not set, not set, set</p>
<p>When xor compares two bits, it sets the bit if only one bit is set.</p>
<p>1	  |0	    |1<br>
<em><strong><strong><strong><strong>|</strong></strong></strong></strong> |</em>_<br>
0                |0               |1<br>
<em><strong><strong><strong><strong>|</strong></strong></strong></strong> |</em><br>
1                |1               |0</p>
<p>xor example:<br>
xor 603A, 3CC9</p>
<p>Convert to binary.<br>
xor 0110 0000 0011 1010, 0011 1100 1100 1001</p>
<p>Line it up, so each bit comparison can be seen.<br>
0110 0000 0011 1010<br>
0011 1100 1100 1001</p>
<p>Perform the operation (let’s look at the leftmost 4 bits).<br>
0110<br>
0011</p>
<p>The two leftmost bits are 0, so neither are set.  So, the resulting bit isn’t set.<br>
0</p>
<p>Then we have 1 and 0 ; only one bit is set, so the resulting bit is set.<br>
1</p>
<p>Then we have 1 and 1 ; both bits are set, so the resulting bit isn’t set.<br>
0</p>
<p>Then we have 0 and 1 ; one bit is set, so resulting bit is set.<br>
1</p>
<p>The result for the first four bits is:<br>
0101</p>
<p>Now, do that for the rest of the bits.<br>
0110 0000 0011 1010<br>
0011 1100 1100 1001</p>
<hr>
<p>0101 1100 1111 0011</p>
<p>Our result is 0101 1100 1111 0011, but that’s in binary.  Convert it back to hex (the same way you went to binary, except reversed),<br>
and<br>
we get:<br>
5CF3</p>
<p>Therefore:  xor 603A, 3CC9 is 5CF3.</p>
<p>Other bitwise operators work the same way…</p>
<p>XOR - sets the resulting bit if only one bit is set<br>
OR - sets the resulting bit if either bit is set<br>
AND - sets the resulting bit if both bits are set</p>
<p>P.S.:  You don’t have to start with the leftmost bit, but I find it easier.  The choice is yours.</p>
<p>Now, let’s do a larger comparison.</p>
<p>XOR C291E90B, 6264CDBD</p>
<p>1100 0010 1001 0001 1110 1001 0000 1011<br>
0110 0010 0110 0100 1100 1101 1011 1101</p>
<hr>
<p>1010 0000 1111 0101 0010 0100 1011 0110</p>
<pre><code>A      0       F       5       2       4       B       6 
</code></pre>
<p>A0F524B6  =)</p>
<p>Time to test you <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Ahhh XORing … This was easy <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Ok so Basically you change that Hex number that you have to a binary</p>
<p>Lets say… you had my number A229BDBC and C8588DB7</p>
<p>In the first line I would write:</p>
<p>1010 0010 0010 1001 1011 1101 1011 1100</p>
<p>The second line would be:</p>
<p>1100 1000 0101 1000 1000 1101 1011 0111</p>
<p>Alright so you line them up… and the basic part of XORing is that</p>
<p>1 and 1 = 0<br>
0 and 1 = 1<br>
1 and 0 = 1<br>
0 and 0 = 0</p>
<p>Soo with my two lines lined up</p>
<p>1010 0010 0010 1001 1011 1101 1011 1100</p>
<h1>1100 1000 0101 1000 1000 1101 1011 0111</h1>
<p>0110 1010 0111 0001 0011 0000 0000 1011</p>
<p>Now you hex that and it is…</p>
<p>0110 1010 0111 0001 0011 0000 0000 1011</p>
<p>6     A      7     1      3       0     0      B</p>
<p>Weee finished XORing <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>O w8 I got a error? O well you get the idea <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> You’ll get different numbers anyway…</p>
<p>[size=15pt] We finished UZEIL’s part <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Now DB’s part…You shouldn’t need that much help for this[/size]</p>
