    <title>Help with pking server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-pking-server/23357</link>
    <description>1. I made a new server (but I forget what it was, I think it was slomiscape.no-ip.info, but can&#39;t remember.) But when I remembered it, and I tried it, it didnet work (I hadent done anything on it yet.

2. How do I make a server basicly (I have an IP). Who ever helps the most on my PK server will be a spawning Mod.

3. In hybridscape, I added a monster to npc.cfg, but it diden&#39;t change anything in Hybridscape. (Yes I saved it, I&#39;m not that stupid)

Thx

(EDIT ON POINT 3.: Now I can&#39;t even get into HybridScape, it loses connection even before it loads, help)</description>
