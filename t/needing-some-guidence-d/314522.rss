    <title>Needing some guidence :D</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/needing-some-guidence-d/314522</link>
    <description>okay, i&#39;ll get straight to the point, i&#39;ve been planning on getting a new guitar for quite sometime, as my first one, a basic peavy raptor exp, has a broken bridge and i&#39;m like 8 hours from the nearest shop and dont want to spend $200 fixing a $20 guitar. Although the problem is, i listen to metal, so the next guitar i have basically just bores me makes me feel as if i&#39;m going no where, it&#39;s a fender acoustic d20 200, very smexy guitar, nice sound, just not my type. So i was planning on trying something like http://www.axemusic.com/product.asp?numRecordPosition=41&amp;P_ID=16126&amp;PT_ID=27
or if i could pull up the money, possibly this, as i&#39;ve seen many bands use this guitar, either that or it was a gibson model of it : http://www.guitarcenter.com/Epiphone-Les-Paul-Custom-Electric-Guitar-100176337-i1149998.gc

now, as i said, i live about 8 hours away from a nearest shop, so i can&#39;t really test the sound and see if i should get some new pickups, but based of reviews, both of these can cover my likings, although i believe i need some more insight.

I&#39;ve probably played a average of, 4 months? i played about a month and stop periodically, for the reason, i hate the sound, and theres no one near me to teach. so i found someone who plays the guitar, hoped he could help, and he did, police officer lawlz, anyway, he was just teaching me chords, don&#39;t get my wrong, it&#39;s obviously progress, how ever, he was guiding toward more country based genre&#39;s, and i was learning the complete opposite i beleive of what i had planned on. I realize it takes time and practice as well.

So basically, my question is, which of those two guitars would best fit something like a band, say uhm... all that remains, possibly Iwrestledabearonce, from &quot;Tastes like kevin bacon&quot;, i prefer something that can get a low, deep sound, as well as a clear, high tone. another band i guess could be divine heresy, face breaker(song), orrrrr Parkway Drive?

If you believe one of these guitars CAN fit it, but you think there&#39;s some suggest upgrades, say some better pickups, please state it, as it will help.

If you noticed the prices, i&#39;m REALLY on a budget, so don&#39;t post anything about ehh $650?


Extra - i think i need a new amp tbh, if i end up going with the cheaper, dean, i probably can fork up about $200 for an amp, i realize it&#39;s not much, but i think anything would be better than what i got atm, Dean Markley k-20x 40 watt, although tbh, it sounds so dull and has no distortion, and then my small peavy backstage 15 watt.


Thanks for the time people :D.</description>

Although the problem is, i listen to metal, so the next guitar i have basically just bores me makes me feel as if i’m going no where, it’s a fender acoustic d20 200, very smexy guitar, nice sound, just not my type. So i was planning on trying something like <a href="http://www.axemusic.com/product.asp?numRecordPosition=41&amp;P_ID=16126&amp;PT_ID=27" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.axemusic.com/product.asp?numRecordPosition=41&amp;P_ID=16126&amp;PT_ID=27</a><br>
or if i could pull up the money, possibly this, as i’ve seen many bands use this guitar, either that or it was a gibson model of it : <a href="http://www.guitarcenter.com/Epiphone-Les-Paul-Custom-Electric-Guitar-100176337-i1149998.gc" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.guitarcenter.com/Epiphone-Les-Paul-Custom-Electric-Guitar-100176337-i1149998.gc</a></p>
<p>now, as i said, i live about 8 hours away from a nearest shop, so i can’t really test the sound and see if i should get some new pickups, but based of reviews, both of these can cover my likings, although i believe i need some more insight.</p>
<p>I’ve probably played a average of, 4 months? i played about a month and stop periodically, for the reason, i hate the sound, and theres no one near me to teach. so i found someone who plays the guitar, hoped he could help, and he did, police officer lawlz, anyway, he was just teaching me chords, don’t get my wrong, it’s obviously progress, how ever, he was guiding toward more country based genre’s, and i was learning the complete opposite i beleive of what i had planned on. I realize it takes time and practice as well.</p>
<p>So basically, my question is, which of those two guitars would best fit something like a band, say uhm… all that remains, possibly Iwrestledabearonce, from “Tastes like kevin bacon”, i prefer something that can get a low, deep sound, as well as a clear, high tone. another band i guess could be divine heresy, face breaker(song), orrrrr Parkway Drive?</p>
<p>If you believe one of these guitars CAN fit it, but you think there’s some suggest upgrades, say some better pickups, please state it, as it will help.</p>
<p>If you noticed the prices, i’m REALLY on a budget, so don’t post anything about ehh $650?</p>
<p>Extra - i think i need a new amp tbh, if i end up going with the cheaper, dean, i probably can fork up about $200 for an amp, i realize it’s not much, but i think anything would be better than what i got atm, Dean Markley k-20x 40 watt, although tbh, it sounds so dull and has no distortion, and then my small peavy backstage 15 watt.</p>
<p>Thanks for the time people :D.</p>
