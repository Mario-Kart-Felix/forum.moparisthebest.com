    <title>Using a timer with X and Y cords?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/using-a-timer-with-x-and-y-cords/309366</link>
    <description>Okay, I have been adding skills to my server. First one is Firemaking. Simple. I added the code, you get exp, the fire appears. But one problem. Since the fire appears using makeGlobalObject(), it wills stay there, as that is what it is coded to do.

To make the fire &#39;burn out&#39; after 100 seconds, I did this:
I addded the int:

[code]public int logsBurningTimer = 0;[/code]

Then I have this code in the lightFire class (code that calls makeGlobalObject() )
[code]c.logsBurningTimer = 100000; //100 seconds[/code]

And I have these ifs:

[code]if (logsBurningTimer &gt; 1){
logsBurningTimer--;
}[/code]

[code]if (logsBurningTimer &lt;= 0) {

//delete the fire and replace with ash

}[/code]

Basically, after 100 seconds it should use the deleteGlobalObject() function to kill the fire. But then I realized a problem. Since it needs the X and Y cords, what should I do.

So my problem is that I can not figure out how to get the cords of where the fire is to delete the *correct* fire. I&#39;m kinda at a loss here.  :confused: What a noob I am =( Any ideas?</description>
