              <p>I find bugs!</p>
<p>X) 2 Player mode, player 2 slices CJ’s head off, and when he respawns, NO HEAD OMG!<br>
(Playstation 2 everyone of these)<br>
X) 1 Player mode, you need 2 controllers. Plant bombs in 2 player spot, go standing there, press button in controller 2, EXPLODE REMOTE BOMBS <em>BOOM</em> after you have pressed.<br>
Bug is, that game “thinks” does it go to 2 player mode, or hospital.<br>
My game crashed/freezed.<br>
X) 1 Player mode, get (REALLY) low hp, like this [[[[[[[[[[[[[[[]<br>
[ = Lost health, ] = Health.<br>
After that, go on roof of eg. Ammu-Nation, (any place you can go in) drop from roof to “yellow spot”.<br>
Result: You die, walk in, stand 0.5-1 seconds, and die again.</p>
<p>Not great bugs, I know more bugs too.</p>

              <p>~I get to difficult places that have a good view of the street, cheat for ammo life and armor, than start shooting everything in sight. I see how long I can go before the cops can stop me.<br>
~I find crazy jumps and stuff and see how many flips I can make my car do or something like that.<br>
~I learned that I could hop off my motorcycle and it would keep going, so I’ve used that to mow down cops without getting stars before.<br>
~It’s fun to see how many people you can carefully kill before you get a star.<br>
~Punch cars until they explode. (it takes forever)<br>
~set yourself on fire and run through the streets.<br>
~Run from the cops in the ramp semi-truck, slam on the brakes, and watch cop cars fly over your head and explode because they almost never land right-side-up.<br>
~Use the fire truck to hose people down the street.<br>
~Make a car-bomb and drive around in an area where you’re likely to be car jacked. They take your car, you wave bye-bye and press the button.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
