    <title>Networking question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/networking-question/413277</link>
    <description>Well i&#39;m starting a big project of making a game and i have a team of 10 friends behind me with atleast 6 years of programming experience and their my old college buddies that i have known since college, I have set up a computer lab in my basement containing 12 computers for us to do our work...but one thing i need to ask is about networking because i have never experimented with it so i was wondering if anyone would know how to setup a network for a game or could point me in a direction to where i can figure it out. I don&#39;t want to release much information about the project currently until i know i can do everything my project requires but when that time comes i will post it in the &quot;Development Progress&quot; board and also i have enough funds to do this i am sure of it.</description>

              <p>are you talking like a peer to peer network, Or a Ladder network?</p>
<p>a peer to peer network is just a connection between the computers, a ladder network is a network between the computers to a router, that can connect to the net, and each other</p>

              <p>Yes I can handle the team and it’s just me who doesn’t know about networking so I was just trying to get some feedback so I can know what my team is doing. I don’t know why I put how much experience they have I was just including more details about my team, also I want to know how it works gamewise so I can be up to speed on that part.</p>

              <p>Hmm, if you guys need to ask this kind of basic questions, you are really not prepared to make a big game.</p>
<p>Also there is no need to boast about the “years of experience” of the size of your team. Are you really sure you can manage 10 people to work together? Seems like a huge task.</p>
<p>Anyway good luck on your project.</p>
