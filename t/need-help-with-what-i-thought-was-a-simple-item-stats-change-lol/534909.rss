    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-what-i-thought-was-a-simple-item-stats-change-lol/534909</link>
    <description>Ok so I went into Item.cfg, found a bronze dagger, raised a few already existing stats, saved and compiled with IDE Eclipse, restarted server and client, went back in and stats are still the same.
