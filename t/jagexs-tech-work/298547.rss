    <description>Well im wondering why no one talks about jagex&#39;s tech work? (or understand)

My assumptions:

[ul][li]No one cares about it, they all just want to hack rs for GP so they can pk all day[/li]
[li]Your all to stupid[/li][/ul]</description>

</aside>
<p>You don’t seem to understand, you are allocating a 180+ byte array and then never getting rid of it for ONE method, and not only that, but a string reverse method that is hardly ever going to be used.  You are right, that isn’t much memory, but why don’t we do it to all the methods.  Your method also requires the method to only run in a single thread, no concurrency possible at all, and in this world where all new computers have multiple cores, that is a very bad thing.</p>

when you build up all of your shit slow methods it slows down, its only 80 bytes and a few headers for the char array, that is not going to hurt anything. what i mean about the “memory leak” is that people never get rid of things, for instance someone might allocate a new object (globably) and use it maybe once or so then just leave it. There is nothing rong with programming things to run as fast as remotely possible, infact thats a +.<br>

              <p>it takes time to allocate new things, moron[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 01, 2009, 04:20:01 pm[/size][hr]i dont care how fast todays processors are, im talking in large scale. for instance, runescape; it runs at about 50 fps. You have to be smart about your code if your going to run up to that and not be slow. Reallocating a different char array with how many every indecies does not happen in an intant, neither does deallocating. If you just allocate it once then you dont have to worry about it. You need to either shutup or think logicly.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 01, 2009, 04:22:54 pm[/size][hr]when you build up all of your shit slow methods it slows down, its only 80 bytes and a few headers for the char array, that is not going to hurt anything. what i mean about the “memory leak” is that people never get rid of things, for instance someone might allocate a new object (globably) and use it maybe once or so then just leave it.

First of all, there are no memory leaks in their method, java has a garbage collector that takes care of unallocating memory.  As soon as that method exits, the character array is deallocated.<br>

It’s a logical memory leak, since he allocates an static array yet never deletes it will never be deleted! (Until exit of program)[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes, in his method, I said there is no memory leak in sun’s method though.</p>

<p>Yes, but you cannot manually call the method, and if you could, calling that method wouldn’t magically remove the object from memory. Only the garbage collector does that.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 30, 2009, 08:49:53 pm[/size][hr][quote=“abraham2119, post:79, topic:298547”]edit: hadnt read light’s post. crap… i couldve sworn there was some method that the object class provided to dispose it manually…[/quote]<br>
java.awt.Graphics has a dispose() method that (kinda) does what you’re describing.</p>
<p>[quote=“JavaDocs”]dispose()<br>
Disposes of this graphics context and releases any system resources that it is using.[/quote]</p>

<p>object.finalize() doesnt do anything…its an empty method…you should override it and object.finalize() is called from the gc when the object is being removed anyway so no need to call it manually[/quote]</p>
