    <description>ok so ive downloaded everything and i just want to go to someones server so im wondering where i have to go to do this. and when using MoparScape v3.1 i usely cant get on cause it always says to press start server, but when i do get on it always says conection lost and it keeps switchen me to different sources and i can never get on for more than 20 secounds. also when i go onto WinRaR to open up MoparScape 3.0 it says 

&#39;java&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file,
press any key to continue...
