    <title>Needing help with connecting to my server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/needing-help-with-connecting-to-my-server/522176</link>
    <description>So a while back i had a older linksys router that I was able to port forward on but that kicked the can so I went out and bought a Netgear R6300 which I figured out how to port forward on and it worked for some time but randomly it wouldn&#39;t let anyone connect to my server and I&#39;ve searched all around to find a fix and I simply cant.  The ip I was using was the one ipchicken.com told me.  I just need a fix for it as I haven&#39;t played with my friends on my server in months because of this.  I would really appreciate any ideas or help.  Also, I tried turning off my firewall and that had no success.  Any ideas help.

Thanks :)</description>
