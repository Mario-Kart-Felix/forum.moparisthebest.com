    <title>Compiler- Unanswered Question/Error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/compiler-unanswered-question-error/447449</link>
    <description>I was searching through everywhere you can think of, I searched the first 9 pages of google, and any sites that were connected to the sites I had checked. No one has the answer to a pretty common problem.
I&#39;m running Windows 7, and using jdk1.6.0_23, I was using 1.7 but I thought the newer version was corrupted or something. 
I have my compiler AND all my .java&#39;s located in C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23\bin
I have Path and CLASSPATH set to C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23\bin; 
my compiler code is
[code]javac *.java
pause[/code]

my error is 

[code]C:\Windows\system32&gt;javac *.java
javac: file not found: *.java
Usage: javac &lt;options&gt; &lt;source files&gt;
use -help for a list of possible options

C:\Windows\systerm32&gt;pause
Press any key to continue . . .[/code]

I assure you, my Environmental Variables are correct, and my .java files are in the same directory specified, and the same as the compiler. I am not new to java and this error makes no sense. It is implying that there&#39;s no java files there when there clearly are.

Sorry if this is in the wrong section, or not under the right Topic etc. I highly doubt I&#39;ll get a solution anyhow. But feel free to tell me that it&#39;s not, or give a solution to try.
