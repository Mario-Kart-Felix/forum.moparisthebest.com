    <description>Great pirate-themed classic metal band from Germany.

Some wiki-info:

Running Wild are a German heavy metal band, formed in 1976 in Hamburg. They were part of the German heavy/speed/power metal scene to emerge in the early to mid 1980s, along with bands such as Helloween, Rage, Accept, Sinner, and Grave Digger. The band has carved its niche in the metal world as the first &quot;pirate metal&quot; band, a theme which took off with the release of Under Jolly Roger in 1987 (thus abandoning the Satanic imagery of their earlier work). 

In the texts of the band&#39;s biographies and album liner notes, some of the words found are some kind of piratical jargon, with some songs even being untranslatable.[citation needed] The band, which is still active today (and widely popular in Germany and Europe) has adopted its freebooter gimmick out of mainman&#39;s Rolf Kasparek&#39;s commitment to ideals of anarchism and libertarian socialism.

Some of the best songs:
