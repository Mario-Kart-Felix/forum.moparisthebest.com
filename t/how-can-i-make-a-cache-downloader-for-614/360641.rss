    <title>How can I make a cache downloader for 614</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-can-i-make-a-cache-downloader-for-614/360641</link>
    <description>I would like the cache to download with the webclient because my m8 who wants to play my private server dont wanna download a cache as he gonna fuck it up and do something wrong and the fact that its 129mb he will think its too much :( is there a way to get it into his pc without him knowing ie the webclient downlloading it? You can do it in a 317 and jagex can do it so why cant we?
FAK IT IM HAVING TOO MUCH PROBLEMS WITH THE 614/613 AND 508 WEBCLIENTS SO IM GOING TO GO AND GET A 317 AS I AM HAVING CONNECTION FROM CLIENT TO SERVER ISSUES!
