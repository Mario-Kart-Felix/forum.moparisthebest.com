    <title>Logout issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/logout-issue/437139</link>
    <description>Basically, when a NORMAL player on the server (rights &gt; 3) tries to logout, i get alot of errors in the run server cmd. Also, it does not let the player logout and after like 10 seconds it disconnects the player. ALSO this only happens to players who do not have rank. Like for an owner ranked account(rights &lt; 3), it does not happen.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Also i am using the Dragon History source which is a PI

This is what the errors look like:

The first pic is the first set of errors, and then i scrolled down in the cmd and took another pic of the rest of the errors. Also the same set of errors (that i took pics of) get spammed in the cmd. Someone plz help me.

and i think this is a mysql error. if somebody knows how to completely disable it please inform me thanks.</description>
