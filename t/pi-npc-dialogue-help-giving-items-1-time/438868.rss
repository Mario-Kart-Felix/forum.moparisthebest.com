    <title>[PI] Npc dialogue Help giving items 1 time</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-npc-dialogue-help-giving-items-1-time/438868</link>
    <description>I put full dialogue and at the end he asks you if you want a prize you can say yes or no. For yes he gives u a prize but you can keep getting the prize as much as times as you want. In my clickingbuttons where he gives you the prize, what code would i need to add for him to give you it once and if you try getting it again it says &quot;sorry you already got a prize&quot;
This is my code in clickingbuttons.java
[code]			if(c.dialogueAction == 94);
			c.getItems().addItem(7927, 1);
c.sendMessage(&quot;The Easter Bunny gave you a Easter Ring!&quot;);[/code]</description>

<p>In the dialoguehandler make a new variable (declare in the player class) c.hasNoEasterRing = true; then when they get it set it back to false.</p>
<p>Also, with that code if they have a full inv they won’t get the item. Do this instead:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (c.getPA().freeSlots() &gt; 0) {
	c.getItems().addItem(7927, 1);
	c.sendMessage("The Easter Bunny gave you a Easter Ring!");
} else {
	Server.itemHandler.createGroundItem(c, 7927, c.absX, c.absY, 1, c.playerId);
	c.sendMessage("The Easter Ring has been placed at your feet.");
}</code></pre>
