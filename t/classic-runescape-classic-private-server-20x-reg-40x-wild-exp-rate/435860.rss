    <description>[size=18pt]Classic[/size] -runescape classic private server.
Hey whats up everyone i wanna start of by saying i like the runescape classic gameplay and the whole aspect of Staking and Pking.  Also, i like to do some skilling if it pays off, because i like to make money.  
  The server has every stat except Agility(who ever really used the stat nehow lol).  All skill stats are designed to give a payout.  There is Fletching town and Crafting guild with certer, mining guild with certer, Karamja banker for fishers, also a  fishing guild with certers. Pot certer for herblaw. Drops from npcs in Edgeville are heavier so that you can obtain gold coins and get Started.    

In Edgeville:
*A 2handed sword seller infront of the general store.
*Master fisher on the side of the store for free fish to help make training easier.
*Portals for wilderness teleports easy pking and training spots.

For PKing:
Sidestat menu
::whoswild command
Teleports from portals to wild.
10 second stand still delay before you can logout.

for those of you wanting to join for these “phat events”<br>
its waste of time false advertisement<br>
server fails, mostly 0-2 ppl on at peak maybe 8.<br>
no one pks.<br>
basically a skillin n trainin server.<br>
admin had to be told about simple glitches.<br>
admin is very immature, he cant run an event let alone server.<br>
bans ppl that say their gunna give their mask set away n quit.<br>
all n all</p>
<p>SAV YOUR TIME, click the next server advertisement. dont waste time trainin on server that will not grow and pking does not exist<br>
[/quote]<br>
He’s not going to bother holding an event if 2 players are online. It’s common sense and if you aren’t an idiot you would know that.<br>
It’s not false advertisement, read above.<br>
You can’t expect the server to have shitloads of people in wildy if it’s brand new and hardly nobody knows about it.<br>
How else admin could know about glitches/bugs if you don’t tell him, that’s just being retarded.<br>
How exactly is the admin immature?, give us more info if you aren’t just raging and making things up.<br>
How can you know that he banned you for giving mask set away? You seem to be just another retarded player that rages when you get punished for not following the rules.</p>
<p>I know what I’m talking about, when I had RSCFusion up, players spreaded out all kinds of bullshit which weren’t true, and one guy even made up shitloads of ridiculous conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>This is what happens to every single guy that tries to open up server and who has strict rules, players that are arrogant and don’t follow up rules and get banned for whatever reason, then they start creating up massive bullshit stories.</p>
<p>I don’t know if the admin is like what he tells us he is, but I’m just saying that don’t believe everything you hear.[/quote]</p>
<p>They’re not “Conspiracy Theories” if they are true. You were extremely partial to the fins on the server just like you’re here dick riding vibes, which is probably you just on another account. You clearly lack the intelligence to understand anything that you don’t want to, and instead of holding a mature discussion you just get mad and start raging. I’m not wasting my time with you.</p>
