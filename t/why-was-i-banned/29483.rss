    <title>Why was I banned?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-was-i-banned/29483</link>
    <description>This seems like the only place to post this but on the moparisthebest.com forums I was banned for spamming. My name on there is RXVL. Can someone (like Moparisthebest) please tell me what I spammed because I think one of my friends hacked into my account and posted random messages. Otherwise, can anyone please post my most recent post so I can tell if it were me or not?

Please do not lock this or flame me.

-Thank you-

              <p>Wow after looking through like the first page, I think only a few were decent posts. I saw alot of incomplete sentences and posts. Maybe instead of dedicating a whole post to “np” you could add something.</p>

              <p>I do not see a ban for you in the logs…don’t you receive a ban message when trying to log in on that account.  Anyway, if you really were banned, re-signing up is not the solution…it shows a lack of respect to the ban and the community, and therefore, an email to one of the mods or admins would probably have been the best course of action.  However, I will leave this thread open for now.</p>
