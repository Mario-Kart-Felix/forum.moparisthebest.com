    <description>What kind of work would be needed to take a multiplayer view game and change it to a first person view game, such as making zones accessable by only certain level players, how to drop shops into diffrent areas, possibly even throwing a few quests in there that change character rights so that they &quot;unlock&quot; new abilities, and even create a few new spells. 

If possible I would like to know how to reskin items too, or make items to skin.
 
Guides would be helpful if you have them.

(I hope I didn&#39;t put my first post in the wrong spot)</description>
