    <title>:562 Server problem:</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-server-problem/366721</link>
    <description>     Hi, I&#39;m new to hosting an RSPS, I&#39;ve played them for several years and would like to host one, now that Jagex banned my RuneScape account. It&#39;s a problem with the 562 clients or server sources, (I don&#39;t know where the start of the problem actually is) which is when I log in to my account, the game is unresponsive, as if it were lagging. The icons, custom cursors, everything is loaded and rendered properly, but it just sits there. After about a minute of messing around my character walks in a diagonal pattern and noclips, but I can&#39;t stop it or anything. I&#39;ve tried all sorts of combinations of clients-sources, and I can&#39;t think of anything else I could possibly do at this point. Since I don&#39;t know the actual name of this problem, I can&#39;t effectivley look for a solution. I&#39;ve searched the forums 3 times with every fathomable combination of symptoms, but nothing relevant showed up.

The programs I&#39;m currently using are:

Khanz_562_IPchanger is my client.

And the source I&#39;m using is PainZone. The source also has a client included, but it doesn&#39;t have an IP changer, and I don&#39;t want to mess with it in fears that I&#39;ll bust it.

Any help will be vastly appreciated, and I will provide pictures/quotes etc. for your disposal.

Thanks.</description>
