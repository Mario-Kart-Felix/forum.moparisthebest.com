    <description>Can someone give me a hand creating context menu commands for Admins/Mods?

What I&#39;d like to do is have the server check for Mod rights. If the charecterRights are 1 or higher, then if the user right clicks a charecter, you can do several things..

Mods:
Jail
Mute
Attack
Trade

Admins/Owner
Jail
Ban
Attack
Trade

I seem to only be able to change the text of the action, but not the actual action itself, for example,
I can change the words &quot;Trade With&quot; to &quot;Kick&quot;, but I&#39;m still just trading with the charecter.

here&#39;s a snippet of my code...

[b]Client.Java[/b]
[code]
 



        outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
        outStream.writeByteC(4); // command slot (does it matter which one?)
        outStream.writeByteA(0); // 0 or 1; 0 if command should be placed on top in context menu
        outStream.writeString(&quot;@whi@Trade With&quot;);
        outStream.endFrameVarSize();
		
		if(playerRights &lt;= 2)
		{
		outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
		outStream.writeByteC(2);		// command slot
		outStream.writeByteA(0);		// 0 or 1; 1 if command should be placed on top in context menu
		outStream.writeString(&quot;@whi@Follow&quot;);
		outStream.endFrameVarSize();
		}
		else if(playerRights &gt;= 2)
		{		
		outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
		outStream.writeByteC(2); // command slot (does it matter which one?)
		outStream.writeByteA(0); // 0 or 1; 0 if command should be placed on top in context menu
		outStream.writeString(&quot;@red@Ban&quot;);
		outStream.endFrameVarSize();
		}

			outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
			outStream.writeByteC(3);		// command slot (does it matter which one?)
			outStream.writeByteA(1);		// 0 or 1; 1 if command should be placed on top in context menu
			outStream.writeString(&quot;Attack&quot;);
			outStream.endFrameVarSize();
			IsInWilderness = true;

if(playerRights &gt;=1)
{		
outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
outStream.writeByteC(5); // command slot (does it matter which one?)
outStream.writeByteA(0); // 0 or 1; 0 if command should be placed on top in context menu
outStream.writeString(&quot;@red@Kick&quot;);
outStream.endFrameVarSize();
}
[/code]


Now.. I know it&#39;s probably going to bullox up something, I&#39;ve noticed the original author has placed this snippet in a seperate area in the client.java, and that code is shown here

[code]
 



        outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
        outStream.writeByteC(4); // command slot (does it matter which one?)
        outStream.writeByteA(0); // 0 or 1; 0 if command should be placed on top in context menu
        outStream.writeString(&quot;@whi@Trade With&quot;);
        outStream.endFrameVarSize();
		
		if(playerRights &lt;= 2)
		{
		outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
		outStream.writeByteC(2);		// command slot
		outStream.writeByteA(0);		// 0 or 1; 1 if command should be placed on top in context menu
		outStream.writeString(&quot;@whi@Follow&quot;);
		outStream.endFrameVarSize();
		}
		else if(playerRights &gt;= 2)
		{		
		outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
		outStream.writeByteC(2); // command slot (does it matter which one?)
		outStream.writeByteA(0); // 0 or 1; 0 if command should be placed on top in context menu
		outStream.writeString(&quot;@red@Ban&quot;);
		outStream.endFrameVarSize();
		}

			outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
			outStream.writeByteC(3);		// command slot (does it matter which one?)
			outStream.writeByteA(1);		// 0 or 1; 1 if command should be placed on top in context menu
			outStream.writeString(&quot;Attack&quot;);
			outStream.endFrameVarSize();
			IsInWilderness = true;

if(playerRights &gt;=1)
{		
outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
outStream.writeByteC(5); // command slot (does it matter which one?)
outStream.writeByteA(0); // 0 or 1; 0 if command should be placed on top in context menu
outStream.writeString(&quot;@red@Kick&quot;);
outStream.endFrameVarSize();
}
[/code]

Simply put.. how can I determine which slot is being used for which function? 

How does the client understand if I want to Ban, or Tele another user, or can I see an example of it being used?</description>

              <p>Thats a good question. Which i don’t have the answer for, but i don’t think you can assign it to a specific packet, although you could edit the client to send a specific packet and you can define it in client class and make it do something, that would be the best way.</p>
<p>“Attack Option”<br>
Case 73:</p>
<p>“Trade With”<br>
Case 153:</p>
<p>“Stats”<br>

<p>It uses packets.</p>
<p>Like the follow packet.</p>
<p>case 153:</p>
<p>I use that specific packet for:</p>
<p>Right click Kick, Ban, Ipban.</p>
<p>Of course to be able to access each part, you would have to have a command that puts the boolean to true, EG:</p>
<p>if(BanIp == true) {<br>
//Code to Right click ipban<br>
}</p>
<p>But the problem, that it will not update the right Names, Like “attack”, “trade with” Without the proper refreshing, thus having to add it under the process to refresh, there could be other ways, but i use that.</p>
