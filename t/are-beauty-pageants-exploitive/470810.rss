    <description>I&#39;d like to discuss a question that often leads people feeling a bit confound.

[b]Are beauty pageants exploitive?[/b]

Before we can start this off, we obviously have to have basic knowledge of what a beauty pageant is. Take a look below;

A beauty pageant or beauty contest, is a competition that mainly focuses on the physical beauty of its contestants, although such contests often incorporate personality, talent, and answers to judges&#39; questions as judged criteria. The phrase almost invariably refers only to contests for women and girls; similar events for men or boys are called by other names and are more likely to be body building contests. Winners of beauty contests are often called beauty queens. Children&#39;s beauty pageants mainly focus on beauty, gowns, sportswear modelling, talent, and personal interviews. Adult and teen pageants focus on makeup, hair and gowns, swimsuit modelling, and personal interviews. Possible awards include titles, tiaras or crowns, sashes, savings bonds, and cash prizes. The children that compete in these beauty contests are aged 2/3 to 10 (sometimes even younger than 2 years old) and usually have one only goal: get the money and get the tiara (tiara and/or trophy and/or ribbon). Mothers of these children are usually trying to live their own dreams through their young daughters. Pageants aren&#39;t all bad though. Pageants are a great way for young women to develop themselves for the future. Many young women who compete in pageants do so to win scholarship money or to be a role model for other young ladies. Many pageant winners do a lot of community work and conduct numerous speaking engagements throughout their reign, to imply the fact that they aren&#39;t all degrading to women.

I&#39;ll give you a minute to comprehend the above information. Now let&#39;s look at the scientific research behind it.

The girls who compete in such large amounts of pageants (and lose) are at a massively greater amount of risk for severe psychological turmoil. Yet, it may also help strengthen the young child&#39;s communication skills, physical fitness and focus.

 To maintain a constant neutral point of view of this, I will completely stop here.

What are your thoughts on these pageants? Would you ever likely put your daughter into one of these contests? Have these contests affected you somehow, where it be direct or indirect?

Keep these questions in mind when expressing your viewpoint.</description>

              <p>I’d like to discuss a question that often leads people feeling a bit confound.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Are beauty pageants exploitive?</span></p>
<p>Before we can start this off, we obviously have to have basic knowledge of what a beauty pageant is. Take a look below;</p>
<p>A beauty pageant or beauty contest, is a competition that mainly focuses on the physical beauty of its contestants, although such contests often incorporate personality, talent, and answers to judges’ questions as judged criteria. The phrase almost invariably refers only to contests for women and girls; similar events for men or boys are called by other names and are more likely to be body building contests. Winners of beauty contests are often called beauty queens. Children’s beauty pageants mainly focus on beauty, gowns, sportswear modelling, talent, and personal interviews. Adult and teen pageants focus on makeup, hair and gowns, swimsuit modelling, and personal interviews. Possible awards include titles, tiaras or crowns, sashes, savings bonds, and cash prizes. The children that compete in these beauty contests are aged 2/3 to 10 (sometimes even younger than 2 years old) and usually have one only goal: get the money and get the tiara (tiara and/or trophy and/or ribbon). Mothers of these children are usually trying to live their own dreams through their young daughters. Pageants aren’t all bad though. Pageants are a great way for young women to develop themselves for the future. Many young women who compete in pageants do so to win scholarship money or to be a role model for other young ladies. Many pageant winners do a lot of community work and conduct numerous speaking engagements throughout their reign, to imply the fact that they aren’t all degrading to women.</p>
<p>I’ll give you a minute to comprehend the above information. Now let’s look at the scientific research behind it.</p>
<p>The girls who compete in such large amounts of pageants (and lose) are at a massively greater amount of risk for severe psychological turmoil. Yet, it may also help strengthen the young child’s communication skills, physical fitness and focus.</p>
<p>To maintain a constant neutral point of view of this, I will completely stop here.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on these pageants? Would you ever likely put your daughter into one of these contests? Have these contests affected you somehow, where it be direct or indirect?</p>
<p>Keep these questions in mind when expressing your viewpoint.</p>
