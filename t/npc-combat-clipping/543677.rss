    <title>NPC Combat Clipping</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-combat-clipping/543677</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I recently added in NPC Combat Clipping (along with the other clippings) and it partially works. The NPC&#39;s won&#39;t run through things like gates and doors to attack the player, but there are some spots that it doesn&#39;t work.

For example: The black dragons at Taverly Dungeon can run through the walls to attack the player, but the chaos dwarfs cannot run through stalagmites to get to the NPC. On the other hand, Black Demons can get through certain stalagmites to attack the player. Is there an easy fix to this?

Tell me what files you need to look at so I can post them :)

Thanks for help in advance!</description>

<p>Any idea on how to make it so the clipping system counts in NPC size?</p>

              <p>Well the NPC’s are clearly running through objects. If I am ranging them I ran run far around a stone wall and they will be in the middle of it, not even close to the entrance. So I am guessing I am missing some map data. Do I just need to find full map data for my revision of the map and pack it into my cache?</p>

              <p>I don’t think most clipping versions take into account the size of the mob or npc, which means it could be looking as if it’s running through certain objects, when actually it’s not. The actually path it’s taking is correct, but the npc is too large and would seem it’s going through objects if there is one nearby.</p>
<p>Also, it could be that you’re missing some map data for that certain area, which means the npc won’t be clipped as it’s not registering an object in its path.</p>
