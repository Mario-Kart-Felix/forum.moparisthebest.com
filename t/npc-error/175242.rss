    <title>NPC Error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-error/175242</link>
    <description>ok, i was putting new models and npc&#39;s into a client, such as mithril dragon, both forms of kalphite queen, etc, and it compiled fine... but then i tried the source associated with that client, and it went crazy! (the server was already running when i compiled the client). i retried the runserver, and it said this: 

[code]Devolution Server 7.0 - Created by Winten/Bakatool
-------------------------------------------------------
Loading npcs... Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExcept
ion: 5000
        at NPCHandler.loadNPCList(NPCHandler.java:1390)
        at NPCHandler.&lt;init&gt;(NPCHandler.java:424)
        at server.main(server.java:99)
[/code]

ok, it says there is a problem at line 1390 in NPCHandler... this is what that line section says:

[code]					combatLevel[Integer.parseInt(token3[0])] = Integer
							.parseInt(token3[2]);
[/code]

(line 424 just says &quot;load(NPC.cfg)&quot; and server.java must have to do with the handler...)

so, how do i fix this?</description>
