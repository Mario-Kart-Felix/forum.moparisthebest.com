    <title>Up-to-date Interface ID List?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/up-to-date-interface-id-list/248818</link>
    <description>Hey people. It&#39;s been a LONG time since I posted a topic. I have no idea where you guys are, so I found a blank 510 client/server and decided to add stuff. I already understand sending stuff and debugging so it should be all good, since I learned a LOT since I left. Now, I&#39;m looking for an Interface ID list. I&#39;ve already searched, but the one I found was old (Like 5200 was the bank, but sending that crashed the client...)

So is there one out there? Or will I have to experiment and write down my results?

Thanks,

~Lin</description>
