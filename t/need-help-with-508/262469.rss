    <title>Need help with 508</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-508/262469</link>
    <description>Hi im trying to get a 508 when i start up my server because i really like them. Anywayz i got one and i understand the concept of them. The only thing i cant seem to get to work is making myself owner of the server... Now dont be stupid saying &quot;oh you have to go into login.java and change your name from the other persons name&quot; ive tried that like 10 thousand times on 10 thousand different 508 sources. NONE OF THEM WORKED. so anyway it would be nice if u could tell me how u really do it because obviously theres more to it that im missing. Please and thank you,

              <p>Dude, you need to compile. First when you open server files, go and that named ‘‘CMD’’ then press on that named ‘‘Rs2&gt;io’’ then restart server.</p>
