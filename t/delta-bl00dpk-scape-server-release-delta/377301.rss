Looks like to me that you’ve been asked to say this or your Blood.<br>
OP: Looks Like a Common Delta. If you change the home from Edge it makes it seem a Little bit more special. Also Don’t add to many customs… = Lag and shitness (Thats my opinion)<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Nope. The server laggs because of all the crap in the process. Also when a delta source has too many npcs (Around 500) it laggs anyway.</p>
<p>Edit: I will make a V2 of this. Only a quick short one. See how you like it.</p>
<p>Also my server has over 200 customs and mine doesn’t lagg one bit. Hosted on 3GB Ram.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thinking of a client with 200+ GOOD Customs like Pvp amor, D claws, etc. (Because those are considered customs) isn’t THAT bad.</p>
<p>Thinking of a client with 200+ Customs like Dildo, recolours, lightsaber, bandos shields etc. Is really gay.</p>

I don’t like that gay custom economy shit<br>
I don’t like how the corporal doesn’t have proper animations</p>

<p>You sir, are an IDIOT, because if you add customs too a server, the client has to preload more models on startup</p>

<p>You obviously haven’t been programming 3 years, because I have been programming 2 years now and know 800x more than you</p>

I do understand that it’s hard to start with anything but Delta though…</p>

Looks like to me that you’ve been asked to say this or your Blood.<br>
OP: Looks Like a Common Delta. If you change the home from Edge it makes it seem a Little bit more special. Also Don’t add to many customs… = Lag and shitness (Thats my opinion)<br>
And i agree With Recker450[quote=“recker450, post:5, topic:377301”]a lot of client edits, the server edits were only moved npcs and objects<br>
and d claws special<br>
could use more work, otherwise the server looks like an common delta.<br>
you should try and fix up a couple of skills that way itll look better[/quote]</p>

<p>why have different types of servers? lol, just a bunch of nonsense really. if you have a different type of server that means there’s must be tutorials on how to edit that type. i don’t mean 317’s and 508s. those are from different versions of runescape.
