    <title>Weird case of null pointers at login</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/weird-case-of-null-pointers-at-login/407518</link>
    <description>I know it is some update we have made that causes the error, but I&#39;d like to see specifically, which piece of coding I have added that causes this problem.

EDIT: Occasionally when you login, it will disconnect you and display those two null pointer errors. I have had the case of two of the same character logging in, and they will STAY logged in which is pretty annoying. Another thing is the unexpected server response which I got, 223 and 253, it is NOWHERE in the coding.

Please help!
