NOTE: ETERNITYX WAS THE OLD SERVER NAME, BUT I HAD TO RENAME IT BECAUSE ANOTHER SERVER HAD THAT NAME. IT IS NOW CALLED VEXONLINE.

Hey there.

VexOnline

Welcome to the VexOnline! This thread covers all of the updates and revision history of the VexOnline  progress. The VexOnline team consists of Nexus (the Owner). He is looking for some friendly staff members with good grammar and who don&#39;t beg for a staff spot.

VexOnline was created with future evolution in thought. We feel that the current Project Insanity layout and code are not designed with the person in mind, but more to give a feeling of stability without quality. The original makers of DSPK attempted to fix this by adding new features, but it horribly destroyed the quality of the stability of it. Our goal is to combine the two to create great stability with great features. We have a great environment for skillers and pkers alike. Combat has been modified to be more fair and more realistic. The server has several dialogues as well to reawaken the once proud RuneScape feeling. Join now and feel the reawakening at VexOnline!
