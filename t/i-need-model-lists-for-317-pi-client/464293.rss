    <title>I need Model lists for 317 PI client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-model-lists-for-317-pi-client/464293</link>
    <description>I have this server and I want to duplicate objects, make new looks for items, and use npcs but I need the Models and the Ints for them. I have searched the internet day after day looking for them. Can anyone please share one?

One example of the things that I need is,
I have a portal, ID 12356 and I want more of the same look, but change the names of them.
I need the Ints for that object for me to duplicate that object then Change ID and Name of it.</description>
