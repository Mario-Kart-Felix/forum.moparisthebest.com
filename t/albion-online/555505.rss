    <description>Thought i&#39;d share a new game that will be released soon (in closed beta right now - $30 to join)

I spent a lot of time looking for a game like runescape and found this beauty. it&#39;s art direction is similar to runescape, with some Ultima online gameplay, but it has much better animations and the game feels smooth - like torchlight smooth.

Has all sorts of skills (mining, fishing, smithing) etc and unlike most games these days, this is a long term game where it will take almost as long as runescape to level up. Majority of games these days you could max out a skill in a day or 2, this has an exp curve similar to RS.

full player driven economy like RS, best gear must be crafted. can trade any items. Has a huge world map, with open pvp zones the more advanced you go into the game. obviously the best ores &amp; resources are guarded in the most dangerous zones. dungeons and stuff too.

ill leave it at that, go check it out i have been playing for a few days and really happy with it.

Oh and one of the main features is that its true multiplatform. android/ios/windows/mac/linux have the same client and share the same servers/accounts.</description>
