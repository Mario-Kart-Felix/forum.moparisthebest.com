    <description>[size=4][b]PROUD TO BE SILAB-FREE[/b][/size]

[size=7][b]PLEASE POST DON&#39;T JUST READ[/b][/size]

[b]Here are some unique features that will be/already are in the server:[/b]

[u]DONE:[/u]

Wearing black d hide body + chaps reduces the amount of time you are frozen for (With all ice spells) by a third.
Wearing karils top + skirt reduces the amount of time you are frozen for (With all ice spells) by half.
Graphics stay with you, not in the place it started.
Done all ancients graphics.
All spells need runes.
Wilderness areas are IDENTICAL to RuneScape - WILDY AREA ONLY.

[b]Here are some things i&#39;ve done to try and make the server better for everyone:[/b]

Completely removed ranged, although you can still train it because you need 70 Ranged for Black Dragonhide. The reason i&#39;ve removed it is because it is the most glitchiest combat skill ever,.

Completely removed magics on NPC&#39;s. Reason behind this is it makes the NPC Follow you, and it will make it better for everyone IMO.

Completely removed Modern Magic&#39;s. I found it will be much better to just offer ancient magics, much cleaner, too. Teleblock will be smoke rush. This also defeats the training of magic through alching and will encourage players to use the Mage Training Arena minigame.

[b]Screenshots:[/b]

I will add screenshots soon.

VPS &#39;Technical&#39; Details:

The server will be hosted on a 24/7 VPS Which i did pay for, the VPS Specs are here:

[img]http://uplo4d.com/images/1408064849vpsdetails.PNG[/img]

Basically this computer will only be running the server... Free 200 players pl0x?

[b]Server &#39;Technical&#39; Details:[/b]

Size of client.java: 322KB!

[b]The Economy:[/b]

PKScapeX WILL Have a full economy, no buying 100 party hats from santa for 5gp each. No typing ::money for 2147M. To earn money you WILL need to skill/pk.

There will be no commands except &quot;::yell:&quot; and &quot;::players&quot;.

There will be certain minigames like a custom Mage Training Arena for mage books, master wands &amp; infinity armour.

[b]NPC Training:[/b]

There is FULL NPC Training! Although object training is offered for those players who choose to, there is also NPC training where you will get 50xp per hit, and the chance of getting good drops.

[b]Job Positions:[/b]

Advanced Coder - Has a pretty good understanding of JAVA Scripting. May be asked to work on their own mini-project for the server.
Simple Coder - Is new to JAVA/Knows little, will be asked to code simple stuff such as shops, commands, autospawn, etc. May also be given a small mini-project to work on (Simple one).
Forum Moderator - We are recruiting only a few Forum Moderators for now, so don&#39;t be disappointed if your application is denied as we are only accepting the perfect people for moderators. (Must apply on the forum for this)
Player Moderator - We are recruiting only a few Player Moderators for now, so don&#39;t be disappointed if your application is denied as we are only accepting the perfect people for moderators. (Must apply on the forum for this)
