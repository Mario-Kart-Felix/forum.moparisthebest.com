    <description>Hey,
Can anyone tell me how I can make it so when a new player joins, they have already done all the quests.  :confused:  :confused: 
I need this because someone has made a few of the quests in-completeble....
I know that you can edit them in the character file once they have made the account, but it would be easier if they started with them done.
Thanks  :D

UPDATE!!!!
I found out how..
Anyone who wants to know PM me.
