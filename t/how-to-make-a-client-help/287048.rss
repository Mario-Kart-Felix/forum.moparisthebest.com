    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-a-client-help/287048</link>
    <description>ok wanted to make a own client
only thing ive done is to download others and edit on them....

i dont know were to start but i think i got to download a client base?
then i dont know anything
i want to have a custom client with some custom items
so i can pk with d claws and dplate and much more:D

but my only problem is where is start
what should i start on?

is there anything i got to download with out the models?
after i get started should i start build on client.java
one of the many classes? what should i do?

and i want music tab and a screenshot tab too
ive found a tut but he doesnt say how to get music tab
or screenshot he just tell us to download googlescape or richscape or something
and then he tell us how to change backround and how to edit on sprites

if you guys know some tutorials then please post
or just help me.
