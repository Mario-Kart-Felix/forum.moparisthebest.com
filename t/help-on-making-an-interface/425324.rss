    <description>I was wondering how you add an interface to a rsps.
By this I mean I want to have a shop on the go for players but have different prestige&#39;s.
Such as if I want ::lshop (lowdonor) that would have some items then ::mshop would have more items
then ::hshop would have the most items and ect. But these would come up as an interface as if you were talking to npc, but you can do this anywhere (wise to not be in wilderness though!)
This is for Demise Pking btw</description>
