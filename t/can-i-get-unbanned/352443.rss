    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-i-get-unbanned/352443</link>
    <description>Hello, I recently got banned for practically no reason :mad: I do know what I did wrong but it was an accident! I had an IP changer program activated and i was going through my tabs, and looked at moparscape it said &quot;Sorry manmade, you are banned from using this forum!
bant
Your ban is not set to expire&quot;
So i thought, &quot;oh well its just bcause i am using a proxy ip&quot; so i take it off, then check and I am still banned :(. I cannot even logout to make a new account.  So please could somebody unban manmade! I didn&#39;t mean any harm whats so ever. I am currently at my friends house, and this is how i am making this thread ( obviously ) I will try to check this thread as much as possible and hopefully you mods/admins will understand and unban my account. ones again, I am SORRY it was an accident, accidents happen.</description>

              <p>1ns again? With that kind of laziness you shouldn’t even be welcome here. And there are several alternatives. One, clear your cookies so you’re no longer logged in, find the email address of a staff member, and email them. Second, join the IRC (ignore the pricks who flame you) and talk to a staff member there.</p>
