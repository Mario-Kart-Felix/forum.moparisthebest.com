              <p>Absolutely. I do have faith in the project because I know that Int Bauk knows what he’s doing to an extent, which is why I’m still willing to watch over the development. As you might know by now though, the ‘Notable Developments’ category is reserved for steady, strong developments, yet this development is lacking in both at the moment.</p>

<p>Yeah, the development has been quite slow but I think we should keep an eye on it incase it picks up. Even so, it’s an interesting development, just lacking in the speed department <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

As for enzo’s development, I’d like to keep a closer watch on it and leave it as ‘considered’ for the time being.

I definitely preferred RuneZ over enzo’s development, it’s just a lot more unique and new, taking both creativity <span class="bbcode-b">and</span> skill to pull of. But I do believe that we should keep watch on enzo’s development incase he pulls something out of the bag unexpectedly.</p>

He apparently started the project back in late 2012, and the previews of the game look pretty cool.[/quote]<br>
Wow. Definitely. I hadn’t read that thread before because I thought it was a game rather than a development by a member from our community and Naruto isn’t among my interests. But wow, that really is fantastic. Absolutely has my vote for this month.</p>

              <p>I’m going to make two nominations for this award.<br>
Firstly, I’d like to nominate the <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,638433.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">RuneZ development</a> by <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=229734" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">12igon8</a>. It’s a <span class="bbcode-b">very</span> unique project and he appears to be taking it seriously and putting a good amount of effort into it so I think this is a good candidate for the award.<br>
The second nomination is <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,636764.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">“a better/more up-to-date Delta”</a> by <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=228152" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">enzo42</a>. He is making good progress on this and I think it will be good to have a more up-to-date version of DeltaScape, especially if he is going to improve it in the way he says that he is (and he is already showing good improvements upon it).</p>
