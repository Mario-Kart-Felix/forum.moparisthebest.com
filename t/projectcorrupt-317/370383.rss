ProjectCorrupt is the next version of Dorkscape.  As some people who previously or currently still are playing Dorkscape, can see there are MANY bugs and issues with the game. So I thought &quot;hey why not take a blank 317 delta source, and work from nothing but a base to ensure no bugs?&quot;. Well that&#39;s what im working on now. And updated pictures will be uploaded as frequently as possible to the Progress page. Along with future updates ill be working on. ProjectCorrupt may be a new server, but will always be considered DorkscapeV2. Later on after the release I will have another webclient hosted on this same site that will be DorkscapeV1 for those of you who love the game as it is. If you wish to submit some suggestions please feel free to do so straight to the left below the Donate link. ProjectCorrupt is the F2P only area of Runescape(With the exception of a few areas). The P2P areas are blocked off by invisible boundries. The Forums are still the same old free hosted forums. An estimated time on when ProjectCorrupt will be released is on the right below the Navigation links. I hope you have enjoyed Dorkscape so far. all I have to say is get ready for greatness because that&#39;s what ProjectCorrupt is planning on brining forth.
