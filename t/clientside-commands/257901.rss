    <title>Clientside commands</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/clientside-commands/257901</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;ve decided to write this tutorial up mainly for two reasons: I had another topic which i req&#39;d a lock ages back and it said I was re-writing it. After using the search bar at the top, the only thing that came up with the word clientside commands was my old locked topic.


[b]Note: This is not a C|P Tutorial, also, to make sure you take in this tutorial I won&#39;t be telling you were to put it but its very VERY obvious what to find. Ive also underlined things that are important.[/b]

[b]Needed:[/b]

[ul][li][i]A understanding of the [u]feature &#39;find[/u]&#39; in notepad.[/i][/li]
[li][i]A working no error client.[/i][/li][/ul]


[b]The Purpose:[/b]
[i]To give you a understanding of what Clientside commands.
I&#39;d like to point out I will just be showing you the basic code of it and it will have no function at all.[/i]

[b]What is a clientside command?[/b]
[i]A clientside command is, well basicly you know you noobs that love servers were you type ::GIVEMESOMESHITZ and you get some shit, its basicly that but its on the client not the server. Sadly I cant and won&#39;t teach you to how to put givemesomeshitz into your client.[/i]

[b]Good Examples.[/b]
[i]A very good example of a clientside command is the &#39;[u]green:&#39; and &#39;red:&#39; [/u]which is in most clients and on the runescape client.[/i]

[b]The &#39;code&#39;.[/b]
[i]The example I&#39;m going to give, altho I said before I wont give you a command with a function, but I will :).[/i]

[code]
	if(s.startsWith(&quot;commandName&quot;)) {
method77(&quot;This will send a message to the player.&quot;, aBoolean991);
}
[/code]

[b]Breakdown[/b]

[code]if(s.startsWith(&quot;commandName&quot;)) {[/code]
[i]This is basicly the name of the command. the &#39;s.&#39; the :: before the command but it has been put into a String. [/i]

[code]method77(&quot;This will send a message to the player.&quot;, aBoolean991);[/code]
[i]Method77 is basicly your sendMessage. I&#39;m not to sure about aBoolean991.[/i]


[b]Were to add commands?[/b]
[i]This is were you have to work it out, I&#39;m sorry but you have to use some brain and use the information in this topic to figure it out. But me being nice heres a clue:[/i]
[code]if(aString887.startsWith(&quot;::&quot;))[/code]

[b]Credits:[/b][i]100% Me.[/i]</description>

              <p>green: and red: actually aren’t commands, they’re just optional text colors.<br>
An example of a clientside command would be ::noclip.<br>
Nice tutorial.</p>
<p>Also, method77 is called as method77(String text, int type, String otherPlayer, boolean dontSend).<br>
Text is the text obviously, type is the type of message you’re sending (for example just a normal message or a trade request), otherPlayer is the name of the player who is trading or dueling you if that’s the type of message you’re sending and the message will only be sent if dontSend is false.</p>
<p>Ex:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">method77("This will send a message to the player.", 0, "", false);</code></pre>
<p>aBoolean991 is whether or not an interface is being shown on the chat box (iirc), if you were wondering.</p>
