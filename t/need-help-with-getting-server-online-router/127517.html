        <p>Wow! Finally another guy with Linksys Router (BEST ROUTER EVER…)</p>
<p>Hmm… You’ve port-forwaded and everything so all I could say is re-try to port-forward and re-do the No-IP just incase again.</p>
<p>Use this guide too:</p>
<blockquote>[b][u][i]2. - Port-Forwarding your Router (EXPLAINED)[/i][/u][/b]
Ahh.. One of the trickiest part to many, and to some very easy. Well whoever you are, this will help you if you're stuck or just dont know how to do it whatsoever. Alright, we have to start by knowing what you're router is. :P We can do this one of two ways. And here they are:
<p><span class="bbcode-b">1)</span> <span class="bbcode-i">Ask your parents. They should know this. If they say you dont have a router, then go ahead and skip this part. If they say you so have a router, ask them what company made the router, and what model it is. They should be able to answer this. And also make sure you know where the router is, to double-check on what they have said yourself. If they do not know this, then we’ll have to go try the other way, which may not always work for everybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">2)</span> [i]Ok. Click on Start, then click on Run, and in the run box type <code>cmd</code> This will take you to a black box which is used in creating a server a lot. It’s called the <span class="bbcode-b">Command Prompt</span>. Now, if you cant get to it that way, try Start, then All Programs (or Program Files), then Accessories, and then click on the program named <span class="bbcode-b">Command Prompt</span> Alright. Now that you’re here, right away when it opens up, type in <code>ipconfig</code> You’re Command Prompt should now look something like this:<br>
<img src="http://img178.imageshack.us/img178/5662/servertut3vc3.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
Now look under the <span class="bbcode-b">Ethernet adapter Wireless Network Connection</span> or something similar, and take a look at the <span class="bbcode-b">Default Gateway</span> line. Write this IP down (the one to the right of the Default Gateway text), or remember it. I reccomend writing it down if you’re new to this. Now minimize you’re Command Prompt, and in the Address/URL Bar at the top of your browser (where you type the website like <a href="http://www.site.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.site.com</a> or anything else), and type in that IP that we just talked about it. In my case, it would be <span class="bbcode-b">192.168.1.1</span>. You should see a Username and Password box, and if there is any other info on there it could be useful. For example mine looks like this:<br>
<img src="http://img132.imageshack.us/img132/6111/servertut4fd1.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
And it tells me the Model of my Router: <span class="bbcode-b">WRT54GL</span>, which I can then Google search it and find out what company makes it. If you cannot find anything like this, Google the Default Gateway IP that we looked at earlier. Some routers have like 192.168.2.1 and can then be identified. If not, I say look around in your house and try and find the router.</p>
<p>Ok. Next part of this step. It’s time to login to your router and Port-Forward. Once you have found your Company and Router, visit <a href="http://www.portforward.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.portforward.com</a> and click on the link that says <span class="bbcode-b">Port Forwarding</span> towards the top of the page. Now on the new page find the Company that made your Router or the Brand of it and then click on the name. You should now see a list of programs. Just click on the first one named <span class="bbcode-b">1st SMTP Server</span> and follow every step of it. The static IP Address box, in there type in the IP that was located to the right of the <span class="bbcode-b">IP Address. . . . . </span> line back in the Command Prompt (in IPCONFIG). Now instead of portforwarding the ports for that program (Port 25), portforward the port that your server is going to use. Most servers use the port 43594, so if you want to port-forward that, then go ahead. If the source you’re going to download soon doesn’t, we’ll change it so it does.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-i">3. - Getting a <a href="http://no-ip.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">No-IP.Org</a> Address for your server</span></span></span><br>
Woot! You’re halfway done! Bottoms Up <em>Drinks</em>! Ok, well dont celebrate <span class="bbcode-i">quite</span> yet. We now get to setup a No-IP Address for your server!  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile1bce.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Visit <a href="http://www.no-ip.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.no-ip.com</a> . Once you’re there, click on the <span class="bbcode-b">Sign-up Now!</span> link towards the right of the Login area (top-right corner of the screen). Enter in <span class="bbcode-b">ALL</span> of the information needed, and you must include a <span class="bbcode-b">REAL</span> E-Mail Address that you can access to verify the account you’re about to make.</p>
<p>After filling everything in, it will tell you to check your inbox of the e-mail address you specified, and follow the instructions on the E-Mail. <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">MAKE SURE YOU DO SO.</span></span></p>
<p>Now when you’re done, Log-In to your account using the Log-In area at the top-right corner of the index/main page (<a href="http://www.no-ip.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.no-ip.com</a>). On the right-hand side, click on <span class="bbcode-b">Add.</span> You should now see a screen like this (I scrolled down a bit to cover more of the main area):<br>
<img src="http://img151.imageshack.us/img151/7159/servertut5lf9.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>For the hostname, put whatever you want the bolded part of <span class="bbcode-b">hostname</span>.no-ip.org to be. In my case, I own the server named TeleScape, so I put <span class="bbcode-i">telescape</span> in the hostname box. Then where it says <span class="bbcode-b">no-ip.biz</span> and where it’s a drop-down menu, select the IP suffix you want to use. In my case, I used <a href="http://no-ip.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.org</a>, because it’s what most people use and it’s a common IP for Private Servers. Also, make sure <span class="bbcode-b">DNS Host (A)</span> is the only option checked below the hostname box. Now in the <span class="bbcode-b">IP Address:</span> box, make sure the IP in there is the same as the IP <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">listed under the Logged In As: text in the top-right hand corner of the page!</span></span> (Looks like this:)<br>
<img src="http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/3318/servertut6yf8.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Now click Create Host, and now you’re done with the No-IP Address part! Congratulations!<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Note:</span> No-IP’s take up to 5 minutes to be added to their server. So they may not work right away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Made by me <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile1bce.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>If it still doesn’t work, make sure you open the port in EVERY SINGLE firewall you own. Even Windows Firewall.</p>
