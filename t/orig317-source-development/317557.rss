    <title>Orig317 Source Development</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/orig317-source-development/317557</link>
    <description>Source Name: Orig317 Source
My Goal: To create a new 317 source, that is easy for beginner java coders to edit, and learn. I want this source to be a replica of the 317 Framework of RuneScape. Once that is completed, the people wanting to use this source can make the changes that they would have wanted to RuneScape.

What I Need to begin:

     a.) Approval of Moderator for this team to be started.

and the following positions:

-Server Coder-
-Server Coder-
-Web Designer-
-Web Graphics Designer-


Please get back to me as soon as possible, thanks.</description>
