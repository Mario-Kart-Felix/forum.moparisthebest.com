    <title>JaGex is about to change the punishment of macroing!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jagex-is-about-to-change-the-punishment-of-macroing/368806</link>
    <description>&quot;[i]Please be aware that we are currently looking at alternative ways in which to punish players who are found guilty of a macro offense. Should an alternative option become available this will be communicated to our players via our homepage.[/i]&quot;

This was stated by Mod Alena in a private email to me. What do you think will happen? 
I can by now tell you that the resettings which has happened and happens has nothing to do with this. It it confirmed by JaGex that it&#39;s a bug. Or is it? Is this a way for JaGex to test out new ways to punish us botters? Discuss guys!</description>

We can only wish <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>Anyways, the messages aren’t automated. They just have pre-made responses so they can increase efficiency. Think about how many players message them about random bans and such. Trust me, if you email them about something serious, you will get a serious response.</p>

<p>So they are looking for a better option, which makes the punishment a win-win situation. What punishment can do that? Teach you a lesson and keep you from botting at the same time?</p>

<p>I don’t think so. Maby encourage to make new accounts ++, but not continue to bot on the same account. When one stat has been reset, you are aware that jagex is keeping an eye on you.

<p>Now I think there is no real way to fix botting, its going to happen one way or another we all know it, So does JaGeX I am sure basically the only real way is to just keep banning like they been doing.[/quote]</p>
<p>yes i’ve touched that thought too. but i’m just looking at the options. what do you guys think could be an alternative option to the big fat ban hammer?</p>
