    <title>Barrows doesnt work fully</title>

    <description>Ok, on my server after i kill lets say &quot;Dharoks brother&quot; and i try to kill him again it says i already killed him. Thats not the problem though.

The problem is when I kill all of the brothers it doesnt reset to let me kill them over again, it keeps telling me i&#39;ve already killed this brother, how do I add killcount and make it where it resets after 6 kills?</description>
