    <description>[center][size=2em][b]Advanced Chest and Furnace Protection[/b]
[/size][/center]This thread will teach you how to protect your chests and furnaces with more options.

There are three types of protection:

[ul][li]Public - Everyone has access to the chest, but only you can destroy it.[/li]
	[li]Private - You and people you specify (details below) have access to the chest, but only you can destroy it.[/li]
	[li]Password - Anyone that knows the password has access to the chest, but only you can destroy it.[/li][/ul]


[size=14pt][b]Public Protection[/b][/size]
Public protection is good if you want everyone to be able to access the items in your chest or furnace, but you don&#39;t want them to be able to destroy it. The syntax for this command is:
[code]/cpublic[/code]

That&#39;s it. There are no advanced arguments for this type of protection.

[size=14pt][b]Password Protection[/b][/size]
Password protection is good if you want a larger set of people to be able to access your chest (but they still can&#39;t destroy it). The syntax for this command is:
[code]/cpassword password[/code]
Example:
[code]/cpassword 12345ABC[/code]
Don&#39;t forget to click on the chest after using the command.

[size=14pt][b]Private Protection[/b][/size]
Private protection has two types: normal and advanced. Normal private protection means only you can access the chest. Advanced protection allows you and certain groups/people of your choosing to have access to it. In both cases, only you can destroy the chest.

[b][u]Normal:[/u][/b]
The syntax for this command is:
[code]/cprivate[/code]

[b][u]Advanced:[/u][/b]
Advanced private protection has extra command arguments that specify who has access to your chest. The command syntax is:
[code]/lwc -c private g:group username[/code]
In this command, [i]g:group[/i] signifies that this group has access to the chest, and [i]username[/i] indicates that specific person can access it.
[b]List of groups:[/b]

[ul][li]admins - Server administrators (red chat name)[/li]
	[li]mods - Server moderators (blue chat name)[/li]
	[li]vip - Server VIP&#39;s (green chat name)[/li]
	[li]default - Everyone (white chat name)[/li][/ul]
Example:
[code]/lwc -c private g:vip Corey[/code]
The above command gives all members of the vip group, and the user &#39;Corey&#39; access to the chest. 
[b]Note that the alias /cprivate does [u]not[/u] work for advanced protection[/b]

Also, advanced protection supports multiple groups/users.
Example:
[code]/lwc -c private g:vip g:mods Corey Lin Moparisthebest[/code]

[size=14pt][b]Other Commands[/b][/size]
[b][u]
Un-register your chest:[/u][/b]
If you unprotect your chest, anyone can use it, or destroy it. Use with caution. The syntax for this command is:
[code]/lwc -r chest[/code]
Then click on your chest.

[b][u]View information on a chest:[/u][/b]
Viewing the information on a registered chest will tell you the type of protection, who protected it, when they protected it, and the chests location. The syntax for this command is:
[code]/cinfo[/code]
Then click on the chest.</description>
