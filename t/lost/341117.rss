<p>There’s still another major doubt though regarding him, since you see how a few episodes back he said (while talking to Jack in Locke’s body) that he can possess a corpse that is on the island, and that he did it with Jack’s dad and later on with Locke - if that’s the case, I see it as more of a supernatural power than any sort of curse; however, he then said he no longer has the ability to escape Locke’s body to transform into “smokey” or take possession of another body (Why not?). On the note that he does repossess his actual body at some point, it doesn’t match with the fact that when the people of Oceanic 815 arrive and enter the cave, they see those two skeletons (there was a flashback of this in this episode) since the body undoubtedly moved from that position once he took control over it.</p>

<p>Actually, I kind of interpreted the ending differently. I don’t think any of them were actually dead, they were letting go of their old ways of doing things.</p>
<p>@‘special’: I finally realized why they used that term (to Jacob’s brother, Aaron, and Walt), and then to use it on Hurley as he took the position as ‘protector’. It seems like the point they’re trying to make is that everyone’s special.<br>
[/quote]No. When Jack sees his father he asks how it is possible that he is there, and the dad responds by asking the same question - obviously entailing they are both dead, as Jack asks “AM I DEAD?”, and the dad asserts this.</p>
<p>And on what basis are you calling them special? When were they called special?</p>
<ul>
<li>Jacob’s mom called his brother special (she said this because she initially believed that Jacob’s brother was going to become the “protector”, but then when she finds out she was mistaken she tells Jacob he is the special one).</li>
<li>Who called Aaron and Walt special?</li>
</ul>

</aside>
<p>I actually can’t remember correctly if they were considered ‘special’, however I’d assume it was because of their age on the island, and Aaron was the only baby (besides Jacob and <em>Unknown</em>) that had been born without dying.<br>
[/quote]So was Ben[/quote]No he wasn’t… Ben only claimed that he was initially, but then we see how he was actually given birth to on a roadside, and the mother died during his birth. That caused the father to join the Dharma Initiative and bring Ben to the island at a young age.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure he wasn’t said to be special, I remember when his mother died, the guy who she was seeing came to Michael and said “Here, have him back, there’s something not right with him. He’s weird” something like that anyway, because he was looking at a bird in a book, and a bird hit the window and died, he was looking at a polar bear in a comic book and one started chasing them. I believe the instance with the polar bear was simply smoky scanning Walts mind and infiltrating them.</p>
<p>The others also took him away, and I believe that woman said he was special. So there is substantial evidence to point towards something isn’t right? The producers have got in way above there heads.</p>

<p>Your questions all relate to ignorance. Who cares about the smoke monster’s name…</p>
<p>[quote=“abraham2119, post:1466, topic:49544”]There’s still another major doubt though regarding him, since you see how a few episodes back he said (while talking to Jack in Locke’s body) that he can possess a corpse that is on the island, and that he did it with Jack’s dad and later on with Locke - if that’s the case, I see it as more of a supernatural power than any sort of curse; however, he then said he no longer has the ability to escape Locke’s body to transform into “smokey” or take possession of another body (Why not?). On the note that he does repossess his actual body at some point, it doesn’t match with the fact that when the people of Oceanic 815 arrive and enter the cave, they see those two skeletons (there was a flashback of this in this episode) since the body undoubtedly moved from that position once he took control over it.</p>
<p>As for how the mother’s job came to be, I’m not quite sure. It should be cleared up in the next episode, although I doubt the fact that the millions of (yet) unanswered questions aroused throughout the series will be answered in the three episodes that are left.</p>
<p>edit: Just found this site which appears to provide useful insight: <a href="http://scifiblock.com/tv/lost/2004-2010/6-15-across-the-sea.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://scifiblock.com/tv/lost/2004-2010/6-15-across-the-sea.htm</a><br>
If I have time, I’ll skim through it.[/quote]</p>
<p>And what? Neither Walt nor Aaron are special. I don’t know why you’d think Walt was special, but if you think Aaron was special because Claire was the only one to ever give birth in the island, this was answered; it was because he was conceived off the island. That is how Sun managed to have her baby, because although it was conceived on the island, she gave birth while off it.</p>

<p>It was just awful; they left a lot of things unanswered (i.e Aaron and Walt being ‘special’, along with the smoke monster; they didn’t do anything with that. We didn’t even know the fucking smoke monster’s name) and a lot of people clueless.</p>

</aside>
<p>The brother who killed his brother for killing his mother is the smoke isnt he? Because the guy who guards that light temple got angry with his brother for killing there mother and pushed him into the light, cave thingy and then the smoke came out? So would that make that dude the smoke? And what is lock? Half smoke?</p>
<p>I dont think I’ve seen the rest. Just have small details.</p>
