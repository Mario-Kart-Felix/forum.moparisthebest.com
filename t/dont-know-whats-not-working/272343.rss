              <p>this could be the reaction of someone else “hacking” into your pc man. yeah this port forwarding stuff is risky and dangerous. but…<br>
try this, it may help.(at least its help at all… I dont get any help…-.-)</p>
<p>turn off your server and turn off your no-ip program.<br>
compile your server and if there is any problems.(I know there might not be any because you stated it worked fine.)<br>
when you turn your server back on with the no-ip program check to see fit he updates are corrupted.<br>
now turn off the updates so you see the lil guy with the glasses(the smiley face thing ya’know.)<br>
now try accessing your server through a client.</p>
<p>if this does not work, get rid of your current no-ip ip adress and get/make a new one.<br>
OR<br>
check to see if your computer is set to a “static ip adress” status. (this was one of my problems)<br>
hopefully you have a virus protection program, run it and make sure you didnt get any worms from april first…-.-.</p>
<p>anyways if this doesnt work… I am sorry I failed you as a person to help (I know it sounds kinda stupid but sorry man)</p>
<p>if this problem is for a 317 source I might be able to help because im better with 317’s. (im still TRYING to learn 508’s and their whole deal but Im not getting anywhere to far on that anytime soon…anyways if you need further help with routing/networking/portforwarding  just let me know.</p>
