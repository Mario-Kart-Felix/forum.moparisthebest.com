    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rating-images/117513</link>
    <description>I am so sick and tired of people giving lame ass ratings on ugly signatures. There needs to be some sort of Rubric, for people posting their graphics, and people rating them. There should also be a standard rating system based on the average ability of people on this forum. Or possibly different rating systems for different skill levels, which, to judge a skill level, you would ultimatley fill out some area on a rubric you would use to post your images. I may sound like I&#39;m ranting, and I am, but I&#39;m also developing ideas here, if we got more people to offer ideas to this, we could make some sort of organized system of rating. 

Ex. - Person posting images to potentially be rated.
[code]
Time spent with graphics:
estimated amount of images made:
etc, etc..
[/code]

I just want to seem some order within this graphics board. I see so many ugly images, stolen images, etc. that get ratings like 8/10, 9/10. I want people to recieve real constructive criticism for their artwork, so they can improve. Not Joe shmoe wanting to beef up his post count. So please, support my idea, add to it, and spread my idea around.</description>

              <p>I don’t think that’s the route to go though, I think us being an open community, everyone should be able to rate and give their opinion on the images. As long as they’re guided through the rating process. If that didn’t work, we could always try and get a new Award, or Staff position, that 2 or 3 people would recieve, a brand new subforum for image rating, where the 2 or 3 Raters would give their professional opinions on the images, as well as the rest of the community.</p>

I want to feel like people know what they’re doing, and will help me with my problems. If we did do this child board thing, it might be a bit too complicated, we’d have to teach everyone all new rules, and it seems a little overboard. Besides Graphics isn’t really MITB’s main field of interest.</p>

You don’t want a bunch of people who have no idea what their doing to rate you, do you? Thats why people go to NSL to get rated, theres some real pros there. A handful of really very talented people should be rating, not new people who make shitty colored blocks of paint.</p>

              <p>I’m just thinking that by having different rating systems for different skill levels will still offer the freedom to rate a 0/10-10/10 but it would be in… ‘Beginner’, ‘Intermediate’, and ‘Pro’. Because when a genuine work of art gets the same rating as a piece of shite that a 12 year old makes. It’s not fair to either user, the newb has nothing to work for, he thinks he’s a pro. While the real Pro is just sitting there dumbfounded at how he got a 9/10 and the 12 year old did too. When I  make something, I want the person to rate me truthfully and what I should add, or should remove.</p>

estimated amount of images made:
etc, etc..</code></pre>
<p>I just want to seem some order within this graphics board. I see so many ugly images, stolen images, etc. that get ratings like 8/10, 9/10. I want people to recieve real constructive criticism for their artwork, so they can improve. Not Joe shmoe wanting to beef up his post count. So please, support my idea, add to it, and spread my idea around.</p>
