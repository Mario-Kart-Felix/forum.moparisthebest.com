    <description>Source: ComboPkerz (Camelot PVP)

Goal: My goal for this project is to bring back that oldschool PK feeling, without the new school garbage. I have always had a love for Camelot PVP sources for some reason, so I have decided to pursue myself in that direction. They have a good combat feel, and they are small/ easy to work with. I am incorporating more modern commands to the server so it will be easier to play. Yes it is a spawn server, but a heavily mediated spawn server.
