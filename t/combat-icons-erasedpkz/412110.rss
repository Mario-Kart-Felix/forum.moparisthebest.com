    <description>OFFERING 10M RSGP FOR WORKING FIX WITH NEW HITSPLATS

Looks liek the random combat icons are not so random afterall, the dmg icon that shows while attacking a npc, is actually the dmg they are supose to be using against me, so when i am using a scimi and dmg icon is mage, that is the type of combat they are dealing to me, but that shows as melee.  So somehow the two are showing properly, but for the one doing the attacking.  

I am having a bit of trouble adding the combat icons in with my new hit splats.  I am using erasedpkz server and client, and tried following the tuts here and on r-server to no avail.  I have managed however to get the old hitsplats working but my combat icons are random.  Example - I am attacked by a mage npc = melee icon. I am dmg by range, I see a melee icon.  IF I attack certain npc, it will show as nothing but range, or show magic icon if I am using melee on for example say corpbeast and I will get a random range icon.  My icons are there as they do appear, but not properly.  

STEPS TAKEN -
- used my current edited client with a unedited original server, I get new hitsplats with no icons and a sudden javathread -5 error and client crash, whre as my current server I get no errors sides the t-2 bank error I get dealing with anything with the bank. Also get no crashes, but my current server gives me random icons and old hit splats

- I have went through and changed my projectiletypes to what would/ shld be their appropiate type, melee-o range -1 and so forth, as I was seeing dbow as projectile type =0 //range hit damage in comentary, so i figured it would be the range icon, did this accordingly to all the projectile types, In return I get NO dmg done, NO hit splats, No icons.  

- I have to be getting close to the problem &gt;.&lt; If anyone has any advice on the issue please contact me at mazterdragoon@gmail.com, or please post a reply here, I am offering a 10m rsgp for a working fix with the new hitsplats.  I was sammed out of 5m the other day so I will not go first, I have tv and patience.  Thank you for any help or advice</description>
