    <title>Custom stat sigs...please help!</title>

    <description>hi everyone!

ok...here is my delema. i am trying to create custom stat signatures to be used by the members of the clan i belong to. while i am not the best with code, i do have some experience with the basics. mainly java and html.

i have found several scripts that [u]should[/u] get the job done (most of them thanks to this site!) but i am lost on what i am supposed to do with them now. some are in php and some are in javascript. i have tried saving them into the proper file type and uploading them...only to be cursed with a slew of errors. i think my biggest issue right now is that i am very unfamiliar with php and many of the codes i have gotten need &quot;tweeking&quot; that i am not able to figure out.  :confused:

so if possible...can someone give me a step by step guide on how to make it actually work?

any help would be much appreciated!! ;)</description>
