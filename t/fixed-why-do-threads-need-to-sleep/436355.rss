    <title>[FIXED]Why do threads need to sleep?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fixed-why-do-threads-need-to-sleep/436355</link>
    <description>I was observing some code and I saw this:

[code=java]
	/**
	 * The constructor I use this for things that can not be static that have to
	 * be ran for the server
	 * 
	 * @throws InterruptedException 
	 * 		if the thread is interrupted
	 */
	public Server() throws InterruptedException {

		/**
		 * Turns on the event manager used to run tasks that may need to be ran
		 * in the future or at a different time in mills
		 */
		this.eventManager = new EventManager();
		
		/**
		 * Starts the eventmanager thread
		 */
		runThread(&quot;EventManager&quot;, eventManager);
		
		/**
		 * Sends a message that the eventmanager is successfully started
		 */
		Logger.log(this, &quot;Eventmanager is successfully running...&quot;);
		
		/**
		 * Sleeps the thread
		 */
		Thread.sleep(500);
		
	}
[/code]

Why do you need to sleep the thread?

Thanks,
Arham

EDIT: Found out why. Just for the sake of learning, I&#39;ll post it so other people can see.

[code=java]
                 * Lets sleep a little, limiting the amount of
                 * connections that can be accepted. This will
                 * stop a possible huge flood of people connecting
                 * at once, which may cause problems.
                 */
                Thread.sleep(100);
