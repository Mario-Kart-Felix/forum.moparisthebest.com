&lt;blockquote&gt;A teacher opens a time capsule that has been dug up at his son&#39;s elementary school; in it are some chilling predictions -- some that have already occurred and others that are about to -- that lead him to believe his family plays a role in the events that are about to unfold.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This was on the tv yesterday and because I&#39;m a huge Nick Cage fan I decided to watch it. I thought it was going to be shit because I hadn&#39;t ever heard of it before but allah was I wrong.

The ending is sort of like The Box(that I wrote about a few months ago)[/url] however it does it so much better, although you are left with the feeling of &quot;what the fuck just happened&quot; it also leaves you with the feeling of &quot;Actually that sort of does make sense&quot;.

Lovely movie hope you enjoy it too if you watch it, and I&#39;d like to know what you guys thought about it.</description>
