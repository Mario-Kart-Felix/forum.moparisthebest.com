    <title>[Important] Error Connecting to Server [Help] [Must Read]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/important-error-connecting-to-server-help-must-read/451297</link>
    <description>[center]Okay, I have downloaded a Client and Source and the only problem is that i can&#39;t get it running.
I downloaded no-ip and i have a host ready. Thats all set.
Now, I went to Client.Java and Ctrl F and did &#39;Server =&#39; and changed most of the ip to my no-ip. 
i did it on both client.java and gui.java i searched the whole file for any other files to changed and its all set.
Now, I downloaded Utorrent (I am not familiar with Utorrent at all) So i changed the Preference and changed the Port to 43594.
Then, I ran the Source&gt;Ran Utorrent&gt;Running Client. and it still says Error Connect to server.
Now, also I really need help with that. I also tried to Portforward and I need help with that. So Skype is really the best way to help me out. Also, I will share my screen with you and you just explain to me whatever.

Please help this guy out. ;)

Post below your Skype and i will add you as soon as possible. Thanks. [/center]</description>
