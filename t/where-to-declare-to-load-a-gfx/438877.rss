    <title>Where To Declare to load a gfx</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-to-declare-to-load-a-gfx/438877</link>
    <description>well basically ive got a stupid while skull instead of a red one for my veng. i had this issue previously when i had a server a few years back. Back then all i did was add a file to my raw folder in my cache and it changed.

so i downloaded a model this time tried putting this in spotanim

[CODE]if(j == 604){//Red skull
				cache[j].anInt405 = 12411;
				cache[j].anInt406 = 4417;
				cache[j].aAnimation_407 = Animation.anims[cache[j].anInt406];
				}[/CODE]

im using xyle source if that helps, and that code didnt fit in very well with everytjing else + i recieved multiple compile errors.</description>
