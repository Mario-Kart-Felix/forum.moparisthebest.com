Introduction

Hello Everybody,

I have been a coder for quite some time and i am ready to take my skills to the next level... i want to put my server online... but there is just ONE problem with that. I don&#39;t have a VPS. I have a good server right now, but it is not complete yet. Right now i am adding in commands and other things. I have some major goals to accomplish while i am coding and running this server online. Here are some of the things that this server has:

• Excellent combat system
• Fully Working Grand Exchange
• All Skills
• Full Trading
• IP changing client

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Goals

I have been working on this base for a few months now cause i have to add, take out, and edit alot of things. It is about 3/4 complete.

• Run the server and receive donations
• Upgrade from the forums site i have now to Joomla

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Positions Available

Hoster: 0/1
Coder: 1/4
Beta Tester: 1/4
Forum Creator: 1/1

And when you become a staff member you will become either a mod or admin on the server depending on how much you help out.
