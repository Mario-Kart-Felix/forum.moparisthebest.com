    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hiring-java-developers/478921</link>
    <description>Hello,

I wasn&#39;t sure where to put this but I will start off by telling you a little about myself, so you know what you are applying for, and what I am striving for.

My name is Daniel. I have been playing Runescape since late 2001. I have seen the game come from the hardest grinding MMO to where it is now. I have a complete understanding for the game and are one of the games oldest players. This is my Runescape experience.

I speak English, everyone on the team must be fluent in English. This will be a business, not a simple lets have fun server, but a true business. In order for a business to operate and grow, communication and customer service is key.

I am only 22 years old, but have already had several successful servers in different types of MMOs including my first runescape private server back in 2006. My server prowess and know how is very high. I understand what it will take to make OUR server the premier private server of Runescape.

I know exactly what I would like in my server and how I would like everything laid out. I do not know however, as to how I am going to get this server going, who will be working for me, or anything about it for that matter. I have littler experience in coding/database work. Thus I need a professional, dedicated team to help me.

I have the funds to pay all the upfront costs of getting the server started. Pay to team members will be based on percentage of incoming donations, after server costs. The more hard work we put in, the more money we will make.

I will give you an example of pay scale:

SoulSplit hosts on average 1200 players a day. If 10 people of that 1200, so only .0083% of the average attendance donate 10 dollars on any given day. That is 100$ a day. Now 10 is a very low donation amount. Lets say we only get that donation amount once every 3 days, so 10x a month. This is 1,000$ a month. 1,000$ - Server costs. Remains the pay, you will receive pay based on your % worth.

Now understand, that is a very low average donation pot. I have played on private servers that only host 25 people a day, where people have donated 100$+ alone.

The team that I hire should be:

Completely adequate and knowledgeable of all concepts of Runescape:
~This includes, items, monsters, drops, potential, skills, quests, etc.

Dedicated to the server:
~Always be on time for scheduled meetings
~Complete all given tasks on time

Completely adequate in their applied position:
~I&#39;m not looking for someone that has a little college experience in coding, I am looking for someone that has previously coded Runescape Private Servers and understands everything involved in the coding of future servers
~Coders should know everything there is to know about coding RSP Servers, mobs, drops, items, npcs, custom features, bosses, potentials, vote points, etc...
~Website design should be completely knowing of all tools and have the know how to handle any and all errors that will occur

I am hiring:

~ 2 Coders
~ 1 Website Designer


If you are interested, PM me with all your experience, time zone, age, the position you are applying for, why I should hire you, what availability you have.

If I like your screening information, we will have a skype call interview.

Again, this is not a fun mosey posey server (1k exp rate bs), this is going to be a high volume, high level of competition server. If you are worried about the things I will have included in this server, they will be discussed upon your hire.

This post will be checked daily for the next week or two, in which time, people will be hired and the server will being construction.

You are dealing with a professional business person, so please be professional in all contact.

Thanks for your time.

//Daniel Larsson</description>

<p>Some developments that don’t get paid will probably be better than this one (IE RuneRebels). You’re better off not paying as people will think you will scam them in the long run. Later, you can say you will pay them in private, but not to us in this topic.</p>
<p>If you remove the pay option, you can move this to the <span class="bbcode-b"><a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,149.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">MORE APPROPRIATE</a></span> board.</p>

              <p>you’d be better off posting something like this on rune-server… anyone who is a decent programmer on here probably doesn’t have time for this imo. You’ll probably end up getting the below average idiots who CAN DO all the stuff you stated, just not properly. Which will fuck you over in the long run, when you have extreme errors that they are incapable of fixing.</p>

<p>If I like your screening information, we will have a skype call interview.</p>
<p>Again, this is not a fun mosey posey server (1k exp rate bs), this is going to be a high volume, high level of competition server. If you are worried about the things I will have included in this server, they will be discussed upon your hire.</p>
<p>This post will be checked daily for the next week or two, in which time, people will be hired and the server will being construction.</p>
<p>You are dealing with a professional business person, so please be professional in all contact.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>
