As far as I know it&#39;s only multiplayer, and there&#39;s never really a lot of active servers. Seems like it would be really fun. I hated the controls for it on the n64 but otherwise the gameplay was great. To play it i&#39;m pretty sure you need half-life 2 but I might be wrong.

lead developer killed himself in 2006, kinda sad. people are still carrying it on, but it looks like the last update was around mid September.</description>
