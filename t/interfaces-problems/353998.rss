    <description>Well on my 525 my interfaces are messed. There is a Zombie Survival minigame and the interface gives rewards. But some of them dont work. If you click it it doesnt give you anything or the wrong items. I also have a command that is ::cmd and it gives an interface with all teles. Probelm is it doesnt tele you, it gives you rewards when you click stuff.

Can someone tell me how to edit what interfaces do on 525 servers? Thanks.</description>
