    <title>How do i add [PIETY &amp; CHIVALRY?]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-add-piety-chivalry/247472</link>
    <description>Well i was using delta scape client and wanted to add items, but all the java files are missing in the client so i can&#39;t add customs. Does anyone know how i can add these to prayers into my client?
The server already has them added in but i need icons and everything for the client.

- =\ not really good at client work.</description>
