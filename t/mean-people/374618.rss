    <description>I think that most new people on here are really badly treated. It seems anyone with 10 - 20 rep gets treated like shit because they don&#39;t have 200 rep. People call them idiots and expect absolute shit from them just because they&#39;re new to the site. I think it&#39;s really mean because you don&#39;t even know them, so how can you judge them? You just see some guy with 10 rep and you think, &quot;That guy&#39;s an idiot nothing he says matters&quot; when really he could be smarter than anyone on this site. This is just my opinion though. Please don&#39;t get mad at me or flame me for writing this... But do post your opinions on it, please.</description>

<p>If you can’t help your self first, why should we bother helping you?</p>
<p>I don’t see why all the new members complain about their questions not being answered, Most if not all questions in the help section are either not in the right section, not server or client related, not following the board rules, show that they did nothing to figure it out on their own, didn’t even try the search bar, didn’t even read the tutorial correctly, or act like they know what their talking about when they didn’t even answer the question correctly and then start a flame war, or even the OP acting like a dick when a person tells them their wrong.</p>

              <p>TC, considering your post, I’m guessing you find a lot of people with 200 rep either idiots or assholes, right? Well, that does seem to apply to some of them, but really, rep has become meaningless over the past year. It used to be a lot different getting rep, you actually had to do something legitimately helpful or make a real, non-C&amp;P tutorial that can actually benefit others’ servers to get it. It took me over a year to get my 200 rep, and that was usually for being nice to people and helping out when I could. Now rep is just thrown around and has lost all of if not most of its meaning here on MPSC. Why? All it takes is one person to give rep to a newcomer who finds absolutely every little things helpful, and then it continues on and on and on.</p>
<p>Until the majority of Moparscape’s community can actually be mature and the newcomers realize how it works around here, rep will mean nothing, there will be flame wars, there will be a lot of things wrong, most of which you probably see all the time.</p>

If people didn’t just come here to A) get 200 rep, b) get a massive post count, c) troll, d) ask stupid questions and not read the rules. Then the older members wouldn’t bash them. The person should be <span class="bbcode-b">competent</span> enough to read the rules of the section their posting in and making sure they know what their talking about before they post something.<br>

Its not their intellect we worry about, its not the ‘able to’ factor, its the ‘trying to’ that comes into play. As long as someone has tried and researched a little bit, then we have no issues. If they just come on here and ask blunt questions (I asked questions, but I tried as well). How newcommers are treated is because of their ‘trying to’ efforts in the first few posts.</p>
