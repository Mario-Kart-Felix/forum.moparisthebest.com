Properly written viruses will spread around a computer and infect other files, this way even if the original virus gets deleted the computer will remain infected.

              <p>I know about viruses. Although, I have never created a virus, I know the mechanics. A few years ago, I went to the library and found a book about viruses and cryptography. I was very intrigued by polymorphic viruses. Granted, this book was made in the 90’s, most of the info was still valid. It didn’t really go into detail about “how they’re made”, but more of the theory behind it.</p>
<p>If I recall, there was a small blurb about a “new” generation of polymorphic viruses that could actually “learn”. What I mean is that it would copy itself, and then when one of the copies was detected, the rest of the copies would alter themselves to avoid detection.</p>

<p>totally depends on who the programmer is. if it’s a shitty one then yes, but, if the programmer did actually take the time to make it replicate itself then you might have a hard time getting them all. But then again, if the anti-virus can detect one it should be able to detect the rest.

For one, how would you know how much understanding I have of these terms. For all you know I could have been studying viruses for the last 6 years. I’m under the impression that because you can’t understand what was said that I mustn’t either. Here, how about you go read a little about viruses?</p>

<p>A computer virus is a type of malicious software program ("malware") that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code. When this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be "infected" with a computer virus. Virus writers use social engineering deceptions and exploit detailed knowledge of security vulnerabilities to initially infect systems and to spread the virus. The vast majority of viruses target systems running Microsoft W...</p>
