    <description>i want to start a server... i don&#39;t have much experience, cause i never managed to start up a server.
i&#39;d like to make a server with the: riotscape source. (other source is fine).
and even though i don&#39;t have much experience i will do everything to help... i can make a cool looking home page and stuff, and a webclient. but i don&#39;t really know how to start up a server.
HELP ME OUT PLEASE.
