    <description>So moparscapians

what kind of women do you like to try and get?


I personaly would love one that is completly independant. One that i know wont be mooching off me simply because shes a woman. One that is with me, not cause she needs me, but just because she wants me.


however despite what i want, i always seem to be drawn towards asking out the emotionaly broken women. The ones that fall completly and desperatly in love within minuits of talking to you, sleep with you once and decide your everything in the world to them. While fun, those kinda women get very very boring, very very fast. No challenge whatsoever.</description>

              <p>I’m always attracted to the cute ones. They don’t care what others think but they still take care of theirselves. They have to be smart but not necessarily a genius, they also have to be funny or at least have a sense of humour. The kind that always has something new to show you but that does not surprise you too much or something that’ll change your opinion of them.<br>
she has to be able to be serious too. I like stable girls too.</p>

<p>The same applies to me. I can talk all night long to someone I know well and has the same kind of humor I have. But until I know you, there’s going to be a lot of silence.[/quote]</p>
<p>There’s not a lot of silence for me, I just can’t go on in the same way THEY can. I hate talking about “hows work… how was your christmas…” etc. I do it anyways, but I still don’t like it. I like getting into deeper conversations, thats when sparks fly.</p>

She has a cute face, is a little chubby though. Which i guess is fine if your an ass/boob man.</p>
<p>She cooks, cleans, will have sex every day, is willing to move away from her family and move in with me, paying half the expenses, and putting 90% of the rest of her money into my account for my own savings.</p>
<p>Or<br>
i can dump her and try my luck at a new girl whos walked into my life who is hotter.</p>
<p>Really hard decision :S seriosly</p>
<p>im thinking about going along with plan A. getting gf to move in with me. And dating the other girl, since shes a uni student and will only have like 1 night a week spare for me anyway.<br>
Everybody wins that way :D[/quote]</p>
<p>sounds like partner a is your soulmate,</p>

<p>The same applies to me. I can talk all night long to someone I know well and has the same kind of humor I have. But until I know you, there’s going to be a lot of silence.</p>
<p>But appearance wise it depends. I fantasize a lot about blond, bit round butt, big boobed girls. But I guess for a serious relationship I’d go for a brunette. A bit like Allison Cameron (character in House, before she made her hair blond). Probably the same personality too. Someone who has brains, isn’t all giggly like a ten year old etc… Again, it all depends on the girl I meet. I guess I can fall in love with a red head too.</p>
