    <title>Am I even alllowed to post webclient questions?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/am-i-even-alllowed-to-post-webclient-questions/364899</link>
    <description>Hey guys, Im having a little bit of trouble making a webclient and I was wondering if you could give me any tips.
I did EVERYTHING like i was suppose to jared and signed it than it gave me the &quot;cant find client.class&quot; so I deleted all .javas and it still gave me the same error after i jared and signed it again.

Have you guys ever had that problem? Could you give me any tips or advice?

Thanks</description>

(even though iIm sure I am.) or the client.jar has to be in the same folder as your “play now.html”?</p>

<p>That’s because the people were requesting for webclients, not help on how to make one. We don’t spoonfeed. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Good luck!</p>
