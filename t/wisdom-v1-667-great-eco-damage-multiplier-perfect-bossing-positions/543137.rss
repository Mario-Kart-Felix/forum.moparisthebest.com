[size=24pt][i][b]Hello All![/b][/i][/size]

[SIZE=&quot;4&quot;][B]Wisdom 667 [/B]is a new RSPS that hopes to become a well known and popular Runescape Private Server. Based on the 667 architecture Wisdom ensures the right mix between spawn and economy that its fun whether you are a new player or an experienced one.[/SIZE]

Wisdom V2 is going to be released soon with a lot of the content I will say below. There is going to be a vote on if RWT will be legal or not within the Server.

Wisdom is hosted on a 16GB Ram Dedicated Server funded by myself and donations. Unlike many servers we take suggestions from every player for updates.

/* I did the pictures very quickly and in a form I dont have to upload one by one. */
[size=24pt][i][b]MEDIA: [sorry for size will update soon][/b][/i][/size]

<p>Correct me if I am wrong but the title and ad leads me to believe its a eco/pvm server. I feel like a PvP token shop is out of place. I do love the idea of unique items such as an ice though.</p>

</aside>
<p>The server is primarily based on PvP but a lot of the game is based on PvM. PvM has been placed so that players are being able to do whatever they like. I have looked again at the subject and I haven’t mentioned anything about PvP so I can see the problem!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
