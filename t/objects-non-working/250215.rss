    <title>Objects .. non-working?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/objects-non-working/250215</link>
    <description>Hey, Devolution based server ;)

I have created a new method, for a skill. Now; the objects in yanille will work, although the same objects, same IDs in rellekka don&#39;t? I have used the traditional Devo &quot;oadd&quot; command on the object, but when u click the ones in Rellekka, the player turns to the object, but doesn&#39;t do what he is supposed to, in the meantime back up in yanille, you click the object, and it does what it should, Anyone got any idea why it won&#39;t work?

I have tried re-creating the rocks by using an addGlobalObject method, they still wouldn&#39;t work.

Any help is appreciated.

Thanks!!</description>
