    <description>Dear RSC Internal Members,

If you were not able to access this section before it was opened up to potential &#39;MoparClassic&#39; developers/helpers than you are at risk of being removed from this board. This board does not have anything to offer, so it won&#39;t be much of an issue. We need to know who is willing to put in the time and effort into the project and if you&#39;re not interested, your access will be terminated. We will begin removing people from these boards on the 20th of September. 

For those of you are interested, we will update you on our current progress, goals and plan of action.</description>

<p>As far about caring what you’re doing, I don’t think you’re right in your actions of mass removal of access is all. If an Admin wants to post here and confirm that they’re happy about you removing all these people’s access then fine.[/quote]Really? Because I didn’t know you did anything, seeing you only made 3 posts about it… 2 on April 27th, 2011 and 1 on June 7th, 2011. None of them indicate that you actually did anything or were involved in any way. So, how exactly were you involved?</p>
<p>I honestly don’t care what you think at this point… You’re obviously too dense to understand that they were added under the assumption that they would contribute in some way, and therefore have no business being here if they are meeting that expectation.</p>
<p>Also, all the admins were notified… If you want one to confirm it with you, then <span class="bbcode-b">you</span> need to go and ask for confirmation. I’m not going to waste their time and ask them to explicitly confirm things outside of PMs… The whole point of giving other people access to things, and responsibilities that come with them is so they don’t have to constantly be pestered with it.</p>
<p>Bottom line, you’re not in charge of the project, Rodgerwilco and I are; not only that, but this has absolutely nothing to do with you or projects you’re involved in. Now, if you want to contribute to the project, then great, otherwise you should mind your own business and worry about projects you’re actually involved in.</p>
<p>P.S. I’m starting to think you’re just continuing to cause trouble…</p>

I don’t give two shits about the content on this board particularly and I’m not bothered about losing access myself though it’s clear from what you’ve said I’m not going to and was never under that impression. I don’t think it was mopar’s intention for you two to just be able to remove whomever you like.[/quote]We’re not just removing anyone who didn’t contribute to MoparClassic, we’re removing people that were added under the assumption that they were going to help.</p>
<p>Also, you’ve been a moderator here for a long time, and you’ve never concerned yourself with anything related to this project before… So, I’ll ask again, why are you concerned all of a sudden?</p>
<p>Also, if they didn’t want us removing people someone would have mentioned it, or said we only get access to add people. I should point out that MITB, Lothy, and Tahorak were all messaged regarding our access. All three responded and there was no objection to removing people for being inactive, and we were then given the ability to administrate the group. In fact, MITB explicitly said we were given permissions to add/<span class="bbcode-b">remove</span> people from the group.</p>
<p>If you’d like, I can PM you the relevant portions of the PMs, but honestly, I don’t see why you’re arguing with me about it; take it up with MITB. Maybe you should just stay focused on ProjectRSC instead of worrying about what is going on with other projects…<br>

<p>This section has several purposes:</p>
<p>[ul][li]To encourage significant development in a friendly environment by removing undesirable members.[/li]<br>
[li]To increase your confidence in this website’s support for RSC development, which will, hopefully, encourage you to undertake joint projects with others that have access to this section, as well as sharing portions of your own personal RSC developments.[/li]<br>
[li]To allow discussion that is RSC-oriented.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>[/quote][/quote]Are you daft? It has already acknowledged it and explained how it’s already been accounted for, and this is in no way contradictory.</p>
<p>Seeing you need to see it again…<br>

<span class="bbcode-b">Everyone who was added (after this board incorporated MoparClassic), was added solely because of MoparClassic, and is therefore subject to removal.</span><br>
This means, people who were here prior to the change or, who have contributed and still show interest will not be removed.</p>
<p>Examples:<br>
Ch3rry - Added for MoparClassic. Has not contributed. Subject to removal.<br>
object - Added before MoparClassic was incorporated. Not subject to removal.<br>
imthenull - Added for MoparClassic. Has contributed. Subject to removal iff it is determined that he doesn’t show interest.</p>
