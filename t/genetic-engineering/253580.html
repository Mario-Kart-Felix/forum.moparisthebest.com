        <p>Well recently ive been doing some reading about genetic engineering. It was all about how the fact that genes are owned and the plausibility of trans-genic animals. It striked me as odd that over half of the human genome is owned. That is a ridiculous notion that some profressor somewhere owns part of my cells. Along with this there were bits about enviromental artists. People who take an animals genome and fuse it with other genomes to make it do particular things. For example an elephant that glows the in the dark or something like that. But it went on to say how it is all made possible and is strips of proteins that are on and off. The code within being the ATGC after its been turned from mRNA. But then it hit me that, as it became more main stream(as it currently is, you can buy kits and stuff) that people will start publishing their own custom made DNA strands on the internet that other people can replicate. Perhaps something reminiscent of moparscape will occur in the future where people are publishing codes and editing them to make their own animal.<br>
The trans-genic bit struck me as odd, because if they can transplant all the proteins that allow speech and oposable thumbs. Along with the insulators and extensions(these are like .dll files for an application.) Then it would be relatively simple to make a transgenic monkey, ape or something else completely. There are ethic laws surrounding the protection of simians in gene transplants. But in the book an example was a parrot, as they are relatively intelligent as they are. With some of the genes from a human it could be made to speak as normaly as any human.<br>
So what do you think?</p>

        <p>your logic hurts my face</p>
<p>virtualy most of what you suggested is impossible with current science, and we wont see in our lifetime. Genes alone will not make a parrot talk like a human.<br>
Nowhere at all has any animal been completly mapped out in regardes to DNA, the closest being 70% from what i remember, and it was a Mammoth. Why a mammoth, i cant remember.<br>
And all this talk of protein? Im not a genious on the subject, but i would belive that protein is as relevant to the creation of DNA strands as cheese if to my car.</p>
<p>all in all, it looks like youve read one source of information and taken that as absalute truth. I think most of what you said is not technicaly wrong… but only because it cant be disproved.</p>
<p>Please paragraph your stuff better too <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> almost stopped reading halfway thru cause i lost my place</p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p>i do think eventually, a very long way away, we will be able to map our own custom genomes using computers and post in places like this forum. Genome Science will become a social subject, and everyone will know how to do it… like riding a bike. A Very long way away in the future though</p>

<p>Lol ur stupid.  You tell him to read up more, while spewing random things without any knowledge on the subject, as said by yourself?  The post above mine is what is learned in <span class="bbcode-b">high-school biology</span>.  Anyway, this entire topic is retarded.  What am I supposed to post about?  I think that this is cool?  There’s no grounds for discussion.  You CAN already do this shit at home anyways, there are plenty(relatively speaking) of people who are making their very own animals glow in the dark.  Bah.</p>

your logic hurts my face</p>
<p>virtualy most of what you suggested is impossible with current science, and we wont see in our lifetime. Genes alone will not make a parrot talk like a human.<br>
Nowhere at all has any animal been completly mapped out in regardes to DNA, the closest being 70% from what i remember, and it was a Mammoth. Why a mammoth, i cant remember.<br>
And all this talk of protein? Im not a genious on the subject, but i would belive that protein is as relevant to the creation of DNA strands as cheese if to my car.</p>
<p>all in all, it looks like youve read one source of information and taken that as absalute truth. I think most of what you said is not technicaly wrong… but only because it cant be disproved.</p>
<p>Please paragraph your stuff better too <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> almost stopped reading halfway thru cause i lost my place</p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p>i do think eventually, a very long way away, we will be able to map our own custom genomes using computers and post in places like this forum. Genome Science will become a social subject, and everyone will know how to do it… like riding a bike. A Very long way away in the future though<br>

<p>Lol ur stupid.  You tell him to read up more, while spewing random things without any knowledge on the subject, as said by yourself?  The post above mine is what is learned in <span class="bbcode-b">high-school biology</span>.  Anyway, this entire topic is retarded.  What am I supposed to post about?  I think that this is cool?  There’s no grounds for discussion.  You CAN already do this shit at home anyways, there are plenty(relatively speaking) of people who are making their very own animals glow in the dark.  Bah.[/quote]</p>
<p>your high school biology is nothing compared to my university biology.</p>
<p>Also, do you actualy read the stuff you post? or do you just black out and mash the keyboard?</p>
<p>i dont know about you but i dont see very many glowing animals around the neighborhood</p>
