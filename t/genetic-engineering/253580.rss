    <title>Genetic Engineering</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/genetic-engineering/253580</link>
    <description>Well recently ive been doing some reading about genetic engineering. It was all about how the fact that genes are owned and the plausibility of trans-genic animals. It striked me as odd that over half of the human genome is owned. That is a ridiculous notion that some profressor somewhere owns part of my cells. Along with this there were bits about enviromental artists. People who take an animals genome and fuse it with other genomes to make it do particular things. For example an elephant that glows the in the dark or something like that. But it went on to say how it is all made possible and is strips of proteins that are on and off. The code within being the ATGC after its been turned from mRNA. But then it hit me that, as it became more main stream(as it currently is, you can buy kits and stuff) that people will start publishing their own custom made DNA strands on the internet that other people can replicate. Perhaps something reminiscent of moparscape will occur in the future where people are publishing codes and editing them to make their own animal. 
The trans-genic bit struck me as odd, because if they can transplant all the proteins that allow speech and oposable thumbs. Along with the insulators and extensions(these are like .dll files for an application.) Then it would be relatively simple to make a transgenic monkey, ape or something else completely. There are ethic laws surrounding the protection of simians in gene transplants. But in the book an example was a parrot, as they are relatively intelligent as they are. With some of the genes from a human it could be made to speak as normaly as any human.
So what do you think?</description>
