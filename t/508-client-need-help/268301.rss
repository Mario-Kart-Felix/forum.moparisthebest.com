    <title>508 Client need help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-client-need-help/268301</link>
    <description>Basically I run my own server, but you need a certain client to run it. I was thinking of putting it on to a website, so i uploaded the files of the client and tried to run it that way, dont work.

How do i get it to work?
like when you play runescape they have there own online client for it. Please Help

Thanks
