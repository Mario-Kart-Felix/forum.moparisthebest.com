    <description>Ok my server runs and complies i can log onto &quot;localhost&quot; but not on my no-ip it says &quot;error connecting to server&quot; so baisicly i have to use &quot;localhost&quot; i cannot figure out why i cannot use no-ip also people cannot join my server i think its something to do with the portforwarding because everything else was easy but this thing which is portforwarding ok this is what put for the port forwarding thing

      Enable         Description          Inbound port         Type            Private IP address             Private port  
 
     Ticked           RSPS                43594-43594         TCP             It had my ip in and           43594-43594
                                                                                           last digit missing
                                                                                           typed in last diget    
Is that correct?</description>
