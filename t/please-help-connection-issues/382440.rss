    <description>Ok. I have been coding my server for 2 weeks now.
I am finally done, and I wish to play online.
I signed up for a .webs account and made a website.
I signed my jar and put my jar on the website to make a webclient.
I am on a 562 running 602 server.
I have changed all of the IPs needed and port forwarded my router.

Here is the problem:
When I go on the web client on my desktop (which has the source)
I can connect. When I go on any of my other 3 computers (which all have the cache
and are all connected to the internet) to play the webclient, It downloads the cache but then it does not load.
I have made sure all of the IPs are changed from 127.0.0.1 to (server IP).
And the server is 24/7 so that isnt the problem. It&#39;s always on.

I am wondering if anyone knows the problem and how to fix it.
Please Help me out, I do not have money to pay so someone please be nice enough to help for free.</description>
