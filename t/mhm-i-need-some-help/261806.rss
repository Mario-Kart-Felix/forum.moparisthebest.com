    <title>Mhm.. I need some help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mhm-i-need-some-help/261806</link>
    <description>I have a 508 and im using it, but my trade does not work. Any idea how to make it work?

When i go to trade someone it comes up but you cant trade anything. And it glitches your inventory.. 

If you need me to post codes, tell me which to post, and i will. 

Thanks in advance.</description>
