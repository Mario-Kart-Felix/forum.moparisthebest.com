    <title>[700+ Matrix] Need to know snowball projectile ID, GFX and animation ID</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/700-matrix-need-to-know-snowball-projectile-id-gfx-and-animation-id/534643</link>
    <description>So I just added the throwing of snowballs into my server but I need to find the ID of the projectile, GFX ID and the animation ID else its useless :(

Been searching for days but cant seem to find it, there are so many IDs that its impossible to do a ID loop to find it out.

Really hope someone can help me with this and tell me it.

Thanks.</description>
