    <title>I have a some important questions about java/Making your own server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-have-a-some-important-questions-about-java-making-your-own-server/19581</link>
    <description>Ok, I tried to read the Java guide Miss. Silabsoft pointed out.. but I can&#39;t stand when people *baby* you into something. I know HTML and Javascript and have wanted to learn Java for a long time, Does anyone know of a guide thats designed for the &quot;learn by example&quot; bunch?


----
Next question:
Is a client (such as Project 16) required for MoparscapeV3.1? When I try to run Project 16 with Mopar I get an error about how the port Mopar needs is in use. 

-------
Next question: I tried to add in a few KBDs (king Black Dragon) into my server, I could only examine them and couldn&#39;t attack.. I don&#39;t understand why though..

------
Next question:
I noticed that I can&#39;t do any trade skills, and can&#39;t even build a fire. When I click a NPC it just makes the Red X like it did something.. (but didn&#39;t) I have to trade to shop NPCs to get the shop window. Whats wrong?

-------
Next Question:
Does anyone know of a guide to manually adjust character appearance? I looked in the tuts. and couldn&#39;t find one.. Or maybe a script to allow character customization between male and female?
----------------

Are my monster, appearance, and craft problems solved from not using a client?
What the hell does a client do? 


I tried searches and other things on this forum before asking... So don&#39;t spam me about how I should look for myself. I would appreciate feedback and help, and I&#39;ll still be working on fixing my problems. 

Thanks for your time and effort, beforehand.

              <p>Thank you very much for the reply =), I’m reading it now and I’ll post my conclusions</p>
<hr>
<p>Edit… wow Imma n00b from hell.<br>
ok I see now, I can actually run a server without having Mopar up… SO now I just stick that code into Client.java… 1 second…</p>
<hr>
<p>Edit#2<br>
Omfg, Wordpad wants to save it in text-only and remove all formatting… which isn’t good because Java is a pain in the ass and needs all that (main reason I haven’t tried learning it thus far)<br>
When I open it in notepad it automaticlly goes to wordpad (I hate wordpad) … If I save and compile will it screw it up?</p>
<h2>Is there a freeware text-based program that I can use?</h2>
<p>Edit#3<br>
if(command.startsWith(“char”)) { is default on Project 16 Oo cool…<br>
But… I want to be more than default… I wanna be able to understand what I’m seeing.<br>
I again ask if anyone knows of a “Learn by example” tutorial for java.</p>
<h2>Thank you very much for your help samuraiblood2! I’m one more tiny hampster-sized step from being a n00b at Java<br>
^^</h2>
<p>Edit#4<br>
when I use the command that I implemented (if(command.startsWith(“char”)) I can’t use the accept button to finish the changes. It just does nothing… Project 16 says “Unhandled Packet”<br>
Is there some way to finalize?</p>
<p>Stil can’t cook, haven’t tried anything else. When building a fire, after the logs are lit you can pick them up again.<br>
I’m trying to make a private server because the real RS2 is easy for people to hack… thus they steal my crap. Is there a client that runs near how RS runs?</p>
<p>(I feel like I ask too much… sigh… so much to try to figure out…)</p>
