    <description>[U][B][SIZE=5]ProFox - Client &amp; Server[/SIZE][/B][/U]
Project Evolved &amp; Foxscape Client v5.0

First before we get started...

1. Yes, this is old.
2. It does use silabsoft items. 
3. Not all models load correctly, head tend to disappear. 
4. This is a WhiteScape base. 
5. I was working with this from scratch, that&#39;s  how he had it posted.
6. It&#39;s ugly because it&#39;s old. (from 2008-09&#39;)
7. Its a 317/377. Custom background. ORBS DONT WORK. get over it.
8. Yes i suck at programming anything
8. I&#39;ve been at it since 2006, so dont bother saying i stole the name. I assure you i was THE first foxscape

KK did that cover almost every possibly neg feedback? KK

If you want to see SOME features, just watch it. Its damn near HD quality:

Client will auto-load all models. Just dump them into the model folder and add stuff to item8.java and run the client. Does everything for you. (I hope)


Reason why this got lost:

Back in 09 stuff happened and I lost access to a computer and the computer got rebooted and erased everything I had. I&#39;ve had the server on backup but couldnt find the client.

Rcently, i found a leeched copy called NaderzPK or something stupid like that. When i saw that i was like WTF.

Anyway, be sure to test your magics on that server and client. a suprise awaits you.

(hint: just type ::runes to make it faster)
