    <title>My music (again, added a new song)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-music-again-added-a-new-song/17422</link>
    <description>Hey guys! I am a singer/songwriter and had a previous topic before about my songs, but I just finished a new song entitled &quot;Still Mine&quot; check it out, and my other songs, Remember my Name was the previous favorite of most people. I think &quot;Still Mine&quot; is pretty good, the guitar portion is pretty pathetic due to me just picking it up today.
