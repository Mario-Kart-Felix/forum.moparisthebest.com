    <title>Anyone ever used installcreator by clickteam.com?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-ever-used-installcreator-by-clickteam-com/2050</link>
    <description>well, i was using it to make installation for my new client, so when it was done, a few people downloaded it, jotti scanned it, and said it had a virus. i dont put viruses into my programs, so i wanted to see what was causing it. i jotti scanned my installer, and sure enough, there was the downloader. then i individually scanned all of the files and programs that i had stuck into the installer to install, and they are all clean. im just wondering if anyone else has had any problems with installcreator free version from clickteam.</description>

<p>There is a thread in the 3rd party programs called ancient scape with the viruses it had.</p>

<p>Anyways, there are other solutions you can use for installation files. Strangly I cannot think of any, but search google?</p>
