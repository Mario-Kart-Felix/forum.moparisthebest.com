    <title>Port Problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/port-problems/282105</link>
    <description>Well it was working fine a week ago, but i recently added new java to my computer. And when i try to run-server it says something is already on port 43594. So i look for the problem but i cant find whats on port 43594. I tried changing the listening port but i found out that i would need to have fixed my compiler, which iv tried and wasnt successful in. 

Iv also tried using port 5555, it has the same errors saying port 5555 is in use. When i had nothing in use at all.  Does anyone know why all of my ports are blocked? Because i really want them to work like old times. I cant compile/run-server cause of it.

So anyone have ideas on what i can do?</description>
