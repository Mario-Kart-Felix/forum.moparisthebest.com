Xclusive is server I&#39;ve been working on so far , my goal for this server is an economy and pvp server with a large player base, a great friendly community, and flawless game-play, a place that make players feel happy and joyful playing Xclusive . I am the only developer and wish to have a team to work along with me . Teamwork and learning is the core-value , When I&#39;ve been playing on the servers before i told myself that this interest me and i wanna learn it so i take my effort and time to learn about creating a server and choosing a base and it was Project insanity i start from a scratch i am not sure of anything but i ask for help and see how people done it via team-viewer and learn from trail and error . I have so many things i wish to learn from the others to improve my knowledge and skills , this is a goal i plan 2 years ago and fail several projects and stop for exam and continue till this very year i believe nothing is impossible if you put in effort and have a not giving up mindset .
