    <description>Would you rather play a remake, or a server with custom content?

I&#39;m thinking about making a 459 and want to know if it should have only RuneScapes content, or not.

I personally think non remake, considering all the remakes we have now. It&#39;ll be 459 data, gameframe, what not, with mostly 459 server side content, however I might throw in a few custom things whether they be quests, minigames, bosses, or other various ideas.</description>

I used to love cache revisions around 474; however, when I started actually playing servers rather than developing them I realized how boring remakes were. I wouldn’t stretch your cache data too high, but I recommend having at least 500+ data so you can have Godwars.<br>
[/quote]Godwars was in 474.</p>
<p>RuneScape remakes always seem exciting, but are typically boring because a lot of small stuff is skipped and slow leveling + few people = not fun. If you can create a decent remake with tons of exploring to do and get a bunch of players, go that way, because that will be more fun than a custom server.[/quote]</p>
<p>Most people like remakes because of nostalgia but it goes away after like 2 days of game play.</p>
<p>It’ll be just as much content and things to do as a remake, if not more. We plan to add tons of stuff from the 459 revision (if that’s the way we go) AND custom content.</p>
