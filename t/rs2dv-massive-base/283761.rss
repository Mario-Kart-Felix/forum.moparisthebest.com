    <title>Rs2DV - Massive base!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rs2dv-massive-base/283761</link>
    <description>Okay, I have recently been working on a new project that involves using RS2DV as a server base, I have got so far with it but I also have a edited one that I havn&#39;t been working on, it has some really good features that not many other RS2DV server have and it can handle up to 500 players on a 250MB Memory computer, I was just wondering if you would like to download it and would you actually use it to build a new server.</description>
