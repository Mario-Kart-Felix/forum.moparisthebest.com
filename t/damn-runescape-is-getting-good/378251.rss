<p>I HATE THE NEW GRAPHICS GETS ME SO MAD I DON’T EVEN WANT TO PLAY</p>
<p>I mean really. They should have option to go back to older RS2 graphics (499 plz) so my eyes don’t bleed everytime I get online</p>
<p>Every game that has those cheesy looking graphics (DirectX idiocy) just looks like WoW which has to have been the WORST GAME to ever exist</p>
<p>My eyes start bleeding because of Jagex trying to make RS like other games, NVM back when they first did the gfx updates, that made me puke, but these new new ones give me headaches (literally) and my eyes start twitching when I’m playing and I even set the graphics to lowest possible settings so it looks like 500-550 (or something like that) on LD.</p>
<p>I loved the chunky blockish kind of look. It made the game special. Just like Minecraft. If they updated MC graphics I would quit because they look fine how they are now. We don’t need games that look like real life unless they’re shooter games.</p>

<p>I laugh because no one can simply accept whats going on. They have to come up with some ridiculous theory as to how Jagex is trying to make more money or piss everyone off. Honestly their simply listening to their players for once. Nothing they do will satisfy everyone, nor will it fix every problem. Just accept what their doing and stop complaining lol.

<p>I laugh because no one can simply accept whats going on. They have to come up with some ridiculous theory as to how Jagex is trying to make more money or piss everyone off. Honestly their simply listening to their players for once. Nothing they do will satisfy everyone, nor will it fix every problem. Just accept what their doing and stop complaining lol. If you don’t like it play another game.</p>
<p>Want a cookie? Too bad.</p>
