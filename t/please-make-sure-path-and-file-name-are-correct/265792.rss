    <description>Hi, I&#39;m new, yeah, anyway..
 Whenever I try to edit any of the .cfg files under the Hybridscape folder, I get the following error:
[code]Cannot create the C:\Program Files\Moparscape\Hybridscape\item.cfg file.
Please make sure that the path and file name are correct.[/code]
Obviously, clicked &#39;ok&#39;, and tried to save it again, the same thing comes up, press ok, and the whole thing just exits out. I&#39;ve been working on this problem for a while but can&#39;t find out what I&#39;m doing wrong, and would realllly appreciate some help... And if this is a really sad error by me, please don&#39;t flame me, I&#39;m not a rocket scientist. I&#39;ve read nearly every tutorial and searched for help already, so as far as I know I&#39;m not breaking any rules... 
Help?
Thankz.</description>
