    <title>Allergy to bud?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/allergy-to-bud/336890</link>
    <description>Yesterday I had an allergic reaction to something, which I am assuming is the bud I smoked. About 3 people shared the first joint we smoked, and it went normally.

About 30min after I was a bit spaced out, and then realised that I couldn&#39;t feel anything inside my mouth. My gums were numb, as if they were numbed at a dentist, and the same with my tongue. I had no idea what was happening, so I decided to try drink &amp; eat, which made no difference. Other symptoms were that my lounge had green / brown stains on it, when the numbness first came about.

I went to a&amp;e, as i thought it could of been something serious, but 30min after taking an allergy tablet they gave me, the numbness &amp; swelling went down.

We&#39;ve been smoking the same weed, from the same dealer various times this week &amp; the week before.

tl;dr- Mouth went completely numb after smoking a J, went to hospitable where they told me it was an allergic reaction. Has this happened to anyone else before? As I&#39;m unsure about whether to smoke it again.</description>

              <p>Is your dealer a trusted one? Could it be that he, or somebody else, laced with something else?</p>
<p>I’m glad I’ll never have that problem. Drugs being semi-legal and all that.</p>

              <p>Yesterday I had an allergic reaction to something, which I am assuming is the bud I smoked. About 3 people shared the first joint we smoked, and it went normally.</p>
<p>About 30min after I was a bit spaced out, and then realised that I couldn’t feel anything inside my mouth. My gums were numb, as if they were numbed at a dentist, and the same with my tongue. I had no idea what was happening, so I decided to try drink &amp; eat, which made no difference. Other symptoms were that my lounge had green / brown stains on it, when the numbness first came about.</p>
<p>I went to a&amp;e, as i thought it could of been something serious, but 30min after taking an allergy tablet they gave me, the numbness &amp; swelling went down.</p>
<p>We’ve been smoking the same weed, from the same dealer various times this week &amp; the week before.</p>
<p>tl;dr- Mouth went completely numb after smoking a J, went to hospitable where they told me it was an allergic reaction. Has this happened to anyone else before? As I’m unsure about whether to smoke it again.</p>
