    <title>[PI] Points for completing a Slayer Task</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-points-for-completing-a-slayer-task/403752</link>
    <description>I was wondering how to give a certain amount of points for completing a slayer task depending on the difficulty of the task. Alot of other PI servers have this.

5 - easy
10 - medium
15 - hard

[b]Anything helps just comment bellow please.[/b]

Also I already have followed Tutorial&#39;s guide on how to do this but his method only gives you one variable per task that is not effected by difficulty. I am not looking for that -&gt; dont repost it!</description>
