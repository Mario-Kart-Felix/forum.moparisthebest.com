    <title>Can&#39;t connect to any server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-connect-to-any-server/469284</link>
    <description>Should be an easy fix, right? Well I believe I&#39;ve tried everything  :(. I can&#39;t log in to my server but I have already tried going into the client.java folder and switched the client IP to local (both 127.0.0.1 &amp; 0.0.0.0), neither have worked, and I tried putting my host name (infernopkz.no-ip.org) in the file and it also didnt work... Can someone please help me? I&#39;ve been trying to fix this for 2 days and I&#39;ve tried everything I googled but nothing will work. I&#39;ve even tried downloading different server/clients and get the same exact thing. I&#39;ve posted 2 threads on the forum and nobody will reply. Someone please help!  :confused:

EDIT:
Btw, I&#39;m almost positive I set the caches in the right spot.
I even went to the signlink.java and I have the cache where the directory leads to.
I&#39;m running on the InsidiaX v2 source/client if that helps too.</description>
