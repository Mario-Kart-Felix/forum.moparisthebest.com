    <title>Trisidia X Changing Server port</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trisidia-x-changing-server-port/475820</link>
    <description>Hello, I was wondering if anyone could help me with a problem I was having.
I just downloaded the TrisidiaX Source+Client and I was just coding a few things, and I wanted to check on my progress.
So I started up the source, and went to go to the client. 
I started that up, when I realized that it&#39;s a client that already has a server&#39;s ip in one of it&#39;s files.
Well, I went to look for the Server&#39;s Ip in it&#39;s Client.java files and I couldn&#39;t find it.
If anyone could help me find out where the servers ip is, it would be extremely helpful.
Also, I have Windows eight, and I don&#39;t know if that would affect any of the things, but I&#39;m just tossing that out there.</description>

              <p>Yeah, I found it last night, it was already changed to 127.0.0.1 before I made any changes to it, which is weird because it didn’t start up. I ended up compiling it, and everything was fine. But, I gave up on that, my port forwarding skills are tragic, and I can’t ever seem to make it work.</p>
