    <title>639 Client Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/639-client-help/481763</link>
    <description>I have been trying to find a way to change a few things for my client and I am kind of stumped as I have never really worked with clients at all.

It&#39;s a 639 client the things I would like to change are:

-Background Image

-Remove Create Account Now Link

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Also, every time it loads or I log out the Auto set up button pops up, and I get an error about getting the CPU info anyway to fix that?</description>
