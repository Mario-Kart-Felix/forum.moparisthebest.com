    <description>Ok, well I&#39;ve decided to make a new source that is reliable and stable and after I finish all of the work needed to make the server that I shall release it to the public. Now, first i&#39;d like to say that it is indeed going to be [b]Delta[/b] but however I won&#39;t miserably leech it like most of the forums do on here. After cleaning/fixing most of the code and editing all of the mini-games to my liking such as ways you get defenders etc. I shall give it to the public so they can they advance on it first of all here are the things i&#39;m using.

[center][b]Server: Blank DeltaScape Source Found On A Different Site. (Not Showing The Site).[/b][/center]
[center][b]Client: Scratch Client Made By Me Based Off Of Delta&#39;s Old v16 Client.[/b][/center]

Ok, now that that is squared away off to other things such as ideas. Well in-general I want to make a source that everyone will like (Because It&#39;s Delta) but people who hate servers like 2speced will like aswell. This is going to be in a way a &quot;Revolution&quot; of Delta servers now say what you want here but I do believe this could work out as I will post progress of the server as I edit it and get it ready for release. I also, want to work on the skills because at the moment the skills are terrible! You use an item on an object and get something that is something in-which I do not like at all! So starting off the first skill I&#39;m going to work on is Herblore only because at the moment Delta has it that when you use an herb on a water-filled vial you get the potion I want to go a-little further then that and add more to it. Please, if you wish to support me post if you wish to flame me get off my topic because chances are you are some Delta-Leech Refugee In Denial That You Leeched It. Thanks, |Joshua|.

[center]Update Blog[/center]
[code]August 18th, 2009: Started working on Herblore using new potions which when you use an herb on the potion you get an &quot;Unfinished Super Strength&quot; etc.
August 19th, 2009: Worked on new handlers and some of them I edited currently added are ActionButtons.java (handles clicking the home teleport etc.), ItemFunctions.java (handles burying clicking etc.) and a new MageHandler.java (handles all mage spells)
August 21st, 2009: Finished the new mini-game i&#39;ve been working on for two days. Posting images of it now hope you all enjoy will be releasing soon![/code]

Ok, well I just finished a new mini-game so you can get items like Torsos, Defenders, and Fighter hats and make it so it doesn&#39;t look like Delta so please enjoy.

[b]Area it takes place in[/b]: Hero&#39;s Guild
[b]Requirements[/b]: 75 Attack and Defence
[b]Rewards[/b]: Torso, Defender, or Fighter Hat.

Ok, well to start it off you teleport to the Hero&#39;s guild there you talk to the door man and he allows you to enter if you have 75+ Attack and Defence. Once inside you can try to go down the ladder into the dungeon but you get stopped by the guard inside. Take the ladder upstairs and talk to the Guild leader he will then grant you access to the Dungeon (If you say yes). Once inside the dungeon you must kill druids to get points each point goes towards new items inside the shop on the same floor as the Leader of the guild.
