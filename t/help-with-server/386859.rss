    <description>Hello everyone, I am brand new to this website and fairly new to RS servers. But none the less i am looking to host a runescape server in the same era as moparscape, the point of this server being just the nostalgia of the old runescape, starting as a noob in a new economy whereas other private or public servers have you jump straight to 126 and have everything you need. Now I&#39;m not quite sure what I&#39;m looking for would be labeled as (private or public), but I&#39;m looking to set it up so that i can manually load the client onto the computer of the people whom want to play and be able to work over the internet without a domain if possible(Having the server computer broadcast via &quot;No-ip&quot; or something of the sorts). This is just going to be set up for me and friends in the small town I live in, I&#39;m not sure what you can do to help on this website, but from what I have been reading it looks promising, if you have an earlier version of mopar or something i could use that would be great. Thanks -Josh   PS. My bad, wrong place to post, where do i move this to?</description>
