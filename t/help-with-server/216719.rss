    <description>I&#39;m new with working with Runescape Private Servers.  I Recently download MoparScape 3.2 w/ Aryan.  I opened the file in Program files and I am trying to edit things in the game, like add objects like portals and chests, but I cannot find the Client.Java file in the folder.  Can someone please help me.  I&#39;m not much of a Techinal person but I do know the basics.

Thank you,

              <p>Well that helps.  I been trying to figure out how to setup a server but I can’t get it right.  I followed a guide and when I got to the step where you have to compile and it always screws up at that moment.  I opened the compiler in Notepad, changed it to what it is supposed to be but it does not work!  I have tried numerous guides to try to make one but none of them work!  Please help![br][br][size=1]Posted on: July 01, 2008, 09:53:06 AM[/size][hr]Can anyone help me make a server please!  I need a tutorial or something.  Its so confusing![br][br][size=1]Posted on: July 01, 2008, 10:06:11 AM[/size][hr]I really need help!!! I don’t understand this.  I downloaded Cheezescape.  I opened it up, followed the instructions, edited Compile, compiled it and it said I need to Recompile with Xlint. I searched Google and didn’t help me at all!  Please help…</p>
