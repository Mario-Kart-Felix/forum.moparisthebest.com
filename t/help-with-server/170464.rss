    <description>alrite heres the problem,,,
i followed the guide to making a server and it worked!!! :)
i was using no-ip..
then i tried making it work on another pc in the house which was connected to the same router and it din&#39;t work,,
then i came back this computer and it didn&#39;t work :(
i was using no-ip on the other pc with the same email adress i used on this pc! it is a prob.
now i want it back and its not working out i think it something to do with port forwarding or no-ip.
cause on port forwarding i have like 4 different hosted applications with the same port 43594
help me fix it! when i am running my server it doesn&#39;t get accepted from diff ips like before help me!!</description>
