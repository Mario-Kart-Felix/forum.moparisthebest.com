    <title>Help with server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-server/387121</link>
    <description>i need help with my server ive portfowarded and tried everything possible buts it not working so i guess i need some1 to help me, i have the following problem, when i am on 127.0.0.1 server ip it works, when im not on it or change it to my no-ip.com ip adress it does not i need help, i search for serverip in client.java for my source, nothing shows up im assuming i only have to change it in the client, in the client i find something for client.java when i look up &#39;server ip&#39; this is what i find: 

Gui.server = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null, &quot;New Server IP: &quot;, &quot;New Server IP&quot;, 1);
if(Gui.server != null &amp;&amp; Gui.server != &quot;&quot;){

Do i change the &#39; New server ip&#39; to my ip, do i change them both, or one, what do i do

and i have another problem, when i look up gui.java (there is none in source, i searched EVERYWHERE) i find these: 

System.out.println(&quot;Connecting to the server!&quot;);
Serverip = &quot;&quot;;
//Serverip = &quot;1&quot;;
//launchURL(&quot;http://www.google.com&quot;);
sign.signlink.startpriv(InetAddress.getByName(Serverip));

do i change the server ip here too? what do i change it to, i know i need to compile, but yea what do i do, and i also find this in gui.java: 

if (cmd.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Server ip&quot;))
{
                    try {
                        String sServer = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(this, &quot;Server IP #:&quot;);
                        Serverip = sServer;
                       
and another one that says:

		private void newIP(){
	 try {
                        String sServer = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(this, &quot;Server IP #:&quot;);
                        server = sServer;
                        sign.signlink.startpriv(InetAddress.getByName(sServer));

and then this

public String Serverip;

what do i put, do i change the server ip for one of them? do i leave them alone? please help, i really am stuck, if you can, can you explain how i change the ip in the gui.java and client.java so i can connect to the server and my friends can to (and how can i make it so when i release the source people who join my server cant edit anything? what do i take out? what do i leave? help please, i know its a stupid question and alot of people seem to do it easy but ive truely exshausted everything and i have no idea what to do at this point........) this is the client and source i used https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,440269.0.html (it is 317 and it is a crappy source but im trying my best to learn java coding before i step up to a 500+ or something (or like a 417 i think it is thats inbetween, in not to egar to do it so soon i just want some experience before i make the jump.)

Edit: am i in the wrong section or something? every1 seems to be looking at it but no1 seems to be replying.</description>
