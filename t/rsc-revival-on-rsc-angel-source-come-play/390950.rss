    <description>Hey everyone, 
i wanna start by saying that i never quit on anyone and this time around im going to pick my staff thoroughly and more responsibly through applications any of the abuse that went on totally unaware of.  I was working on switching over to RSCA so sorry for the downtime. We were previously up using the Easy Rsc source which we all know isn&#39;t the way to make a server last. So now we are making a second attempt and we are ready to do it the right way. 


Updates:


new client colors

portals added

rune rocks mining guild added

New Trade Screen 

http://img15.imageshack.us/i/tradewindow.png/

New Duel Screen
http://img225.imageshack.us/i/duelscreen.png/

New Town

New Island

New Kbd lair
http://img40.imageshack.us/i/kbdi.png/
and alot more that you will have to see in game.

drops for all Npc&#39;s from our last source has been added that way economy will be easy going for circulation of rune items.

We Are accepting applications for developers and moderators. as we are doing it all alone me and Drozki that is.. and any rumors floating around about us are fake just a bunch of haters wish us luck!

Pompano may have helped him…but it still doesn’t mean it’s the most stable source. Since we saw what happened to pompanos server.</p>

<p>its the rscangel source with everything fixed and its not the one from the “development section” i got it from someone … listen and maybe you can learn something the source was edited prior to it belonging to me… meaning yes its the same rsc angel source but with a alot changed and added…</p>
<p>and can we cut the flaming to a minimal ? this is a advertisement…[/quote]<br>
Dont make shit up in your advertisement and you wont get flamed… As for your comments, you cant go from stating you dont know what fixes are made because it was “handed down to you” to defending it with how much stuff has been changed. Its obvious you didnt do jack shit to this source based on your comments.</p>

<p>lets say every bug including packet protection (needs testing)  for the packet exploit that took down devil ? i cant name specific bugs as this source was handed to down to me but i guess your going to have to see for yourself if you dont believe me… log into the game the source might look pretty familiar to you and alot of other players…</p>
