<p>Ok all, I have a bit of spare time on my hands and seing as my freinds server went down, i wanted to see if any of you guys where interested in making a server development team.</p>
<p>For some time now, i have always wanted to work in a team of mature and experienced individuals and produce a server that is successful. As i said before my friends server went down because of many reasons. I’m not going to explain all of them, but i can tell you the server owner was 12 years old and didn’t care. The server had an avarage of around 30 - 40 people online, and they had a fully working website and an vps.</p>
<p>The point that i’m trying to make is the server didn’t work because of the lack of maturity and commitment. Thats why i want to make a team of people that will be commited, mature and polite.</p>
<p>I havent decided on a source yet but depending on the kind of reply i have will depend on if it will be a server/client. We will also have a website and hopefully a vps slot and an active donation system.</p>
<p>My experience in servers is quite short. I have messed around with a few projects and have also co-owned a prety successful server. Although this server didn’t last that long and soon went down because the hoster had personal reasons to attend to. Some of you may know that i make custom models aswell in my spare time. So some models may be custom created just for this server.</p>
<p>Ok, enough about me and my past experiences.</p>
<p>As i said before i am looking for Mature Polite and Commited individuals. Don’t bother posting an application if you are 12, bad mannerd and have no experience what so ever in any of the team possitions.</p>
