    <description>When players mine on my server, as long as they have a pickaxe in their inventory, it shows a dragon pickaxe picking at the rocks. This isn&#39;t an issue or anything, I would just like it fixed and i wouldn&#39;t know what file to go into to fix it. Also, if the player is wielding a pickaxe, it shows both pickaxes picking at the rocks. How can I make it so that it only shows the pickaxe they are wielding?</description>

              <p>The issue with the animation showing both pickaxes can be solved by updating you anims:<br>

(I did similar to this when I had your issue. I already had 602 anims loading, I just needed the new file).</p>
<p>The issue with it showing just your dragon pickaxe, I’d have to see your code. Probably in a file called Mining.java</p>
