    <title>Items invisible rep++</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/items-invisible-rep/420161</link>
    <description>added some models (completionist cape and the new boots) but when i try to wear them they are invisible. in the inventory they are fine and everything seems fine about them the floor model works aswell. but when i try to wear them they are invisible and they stop the character from updating (e.g if i wore completionist cape then a nezzy helm the nezzy helm is also invisible.) 

i have no idea how to fix this and i really want new items in my server :s


all help appreciated</description>

              <p>Are they invisible in the item slots as well?</p>
<p>The problem is ussualy the custom sprite edited in whatever, probably isnt set right. Either that or your not adding the right numbers in for the right settings. Like theres three different custom pictures for one Custom item. Each plays a different role. 1 is for when its dropped, laying on the grouns. 1 is for when your wearing it. and 1 is for when itâ€™s in your item slot.</p>
<p>Could be anything really. Most likely the code is wrong or the item sprites are wrong.</p>
