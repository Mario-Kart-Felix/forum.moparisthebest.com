    <title>Poem: That feeling</title>

    <description>That feeling

You get that feeling when in love
That feeling that holds inside
That feeling that rests aside
You get that feeling when family hates you
That feeling when they point and degrade you
You get that feeling when most dear
That feeling that leaves a tear
You get that feeling big as heap
Then that feeling comes to sleep

That feeling which lasts an eternity
That feeling never forgotten
You get that feeling when relationship dies
That feeling which then flies
You get that feeling rare indeed
That feeling which runs like steed
And in then
That feeling&#39;s end

---

Thanks for reading that and taking time to come.</description>
