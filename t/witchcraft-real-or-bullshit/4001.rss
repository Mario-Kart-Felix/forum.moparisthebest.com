    <title>Witchcraft: Real or Bullshit?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/witchcraft-real-or-bullshit/4001</link>
    <description>Do you guys believe in witchcraft? I&#39;m in the &#39;I Don&#39;t Know&#39; zone.

Here are some spells and &#39;information&#39;. (I&#39;m pretty sure these are bullshit.) :P

SIMPLE BLACK CANDLE ANTI-LOVE SPELL 

Carve the taker&#39;s name and the words &quot;GOOD BYE&quot; on a black candle. 

Dress it with Uncrossing oil. At its base place a broken or unlinked length
 of fine chain (you can find a broken length of bead chain at the bottom of 
the Uncrossing Oil i make and sell, or just break a piece of jewelry chain).
 Light the candle and as it burns, have a good cry and say &quot;good bye.&quot; 
When the candle has burned about half-way, use its flame to set afire a
 photo or name-paper of the taker, then extinguish the candle in the ashes
 of the paper and throw the whole mess, broken chain and all, away at a 
crossroads in the dark of the night or bury it in a graveyard. Go home and
 bathe in astringent and pungent protective and mind-clearing herbs such 
as eucalyptus, walnut, bay, and the like (e.g. 13 Herb Bath) and get on 
with your life.

Good luck!

Sources of Energy

We live in a sea of energy. Everything around us is energy; we are 
energy. Matter is energy in a very tight, very specific matrix or form. 
Energy bombards us in various forms every day: light, sound, heat, 
radiation, gravity, ultraviolet light, microwaves, radio waves, television 
signals, and many, many others. All these forms of energy both include
 and make up the more subtle energy that we use in magick. This 
more subtle energy form has been called the &quot;ether,&quot; or &quot;aether,&quot; by
 some. Regardless of the name, it is a form of energy that interacts 
with, and possibly comprises, all other energy types.

The energy that is used in magick comes from six basic sources.

         1.

            The energy within ourselves
         2.

            The environment around us such as plants, rocks, 
            nature, etc.
         3.

            Energy willingly given by others and/or energy 
            created through various forms of personal empowerment
         4.

            Energy from other planes of existence: astral, mental,
             elemental, spiritual
         5.

            Energy from higher entities and divine sources.
         6.

            **From the pain/suffering/death of living beings.

** Use of this type of energy gathering is rare, yet powerful and usually
 comes with grave consequences.  This type of energy is usually 
reserved for the darker, and more black aspects of magic.

Personal/Internal Energy

The physical body is a storehouse and channel for energy. The center of
 our energy system is our chakras. The chakras are energy transfer
 points within the body, and are responsible for regulating the 
energy field of the body. There are seven major chakras located along
 the spine, 21 minor chakras (two are located in the palms of the hand), 
and there are over 101 other energy points located across the body. The 
chakras help to regulate the flow of energy within the body and to form the 
auric bodies. The auric bodies are basically shells of energy which surround
 the body. This energy field is known as the aura; some people like to call 
it the Human Energy Field. More on this later.

The body stores energy for normal and magickal use. In addition, the body
 can channel energy from outside sources to replenish itself and for use in
 magick. People tend to have three types of internal energy:

          o

            Life essence
          o

            Normal energy
          o

            Magickal energy

The life essence is the core of our energy system. This energy is
 rarely tapped.

The normal energy of the body is that energy that is used in everyday
 life. It is the easiest energy to replace, and is replenished through 
eating, resting, exercise, and other activities designed to restore/maintain
 the body/mind.

Every individual possesses magickal energy to some extent. As with normal 
energy, magickal energy can be developed and its capacity increased. 
Magickal energy is the energy gathered from the energy that permeates all
 things. Magickal energy can be used to increase normal energy. Magickal 
energy can also be replaced through rest, as well as through several exercises
 that will be discussed throughout this course of study.
*==========================================================================*
    -Your tongue flicks sharply as you lick the tip of 
    your finger, checking the arcane signals in the air.
      Then slowly, you exhale while projecting out blood
     thirsty energy particles.  You emit them from every 
    direction - no one in close proximity is immune.  

    To the trained eye it would look as if your aura just 
    grew 5 fold and was trying to compress 15 feet of 
    energy back down into a 3 foot area!

    To you it just feels like your blood has been set on 
    fire, like you&#39;re oozing with new, fresh power.  Use
     it as you will, but never abuse it - else your fate be 
    sealed.-

Siphoning Strength like that found in the Vampiric Aura ability is much 
like absorbing energy from any other source.  The advantage is however, 
it&#39;s usually MUCH easier to steal energy from another living being than it 
is a plant or animal.  Due to humanistic properties of their specific energy, 
not much transition in vibration must be made with any type or energy exchange.

THE CHARGE OF JUPITER In request for a spell for the return of money owed one: 

You will need: * Green candle * 

Picture of person who owes money, to use if needed for visualization 

The Projective Hand is the hand that is normally used for manual activities such as 
writing, peeling apples and dialing telephones is symbolically thought to be the 
point at which Personal Power is visualized as streaming from the body. In ritual, 
personal power is visualized streaming out of the palm or fingers of the hand for 
various magical goals. This is also the hand in which tools such as the Athame and
 wand are held. Ambidextrous persons simply chose which hand to utilize for this 
purpose. Hold the candle in your projective hand visualize the money re-manifesting
 in you life. Remember, never visualize the process of getting the money, visualize 
receiving the money from the one who owes it to you. Recite the following: I 
charge you by Jupiter, I charge you by the Earth, I charge you Sun, Moon, and 
Stars: Bring back my money to me, Prosperity. Money to me, Prosperity. Money
 to me, Prosperity. Place the candle in its holder. Light it. Sit or stand before it 
watching the flame transform the wax into a liquid. Visualize the candle releasing 
the energies that you&#39;ve placed within it. Sense it sending out power to bring your
 ex for return of money into manifestation. Let the candle burn down to its end 
(if in a safe location). Or, allow it to burn for 4, 8, or 16 minutes daily until 
your need manifests.

What exactly is &#39;Magic&#39; / &#39;Magick&#39;?

Magic or magick is the process of causing change to occur by the application 
and direction of energy through the use of your Will. Many people add a &quot;k&quot; to 
magic to distinguish true magick from slight-of-hand and stage tricks.

Magick is a broad term given to the ability to make events occur in accordance 
with one&#39;s true Will by the application of sufficient energy.

In other words, magick is the direction of energy to a desired goal or purpose. 
It is a manipulation of the more subtle forms of energy which science is just 
beginning to understand.

Magic is a very general term which describes many branches or areas within it&#39;s 
self.  For example, one could compare the broad term of magic to the broad term 
of medicine.  In the medical field, there are various things someone can specialize
 in.  Whether it be Cardiology, Pediatrics, or Surgeon just to name a few.  
Accordingly,  there are many very different and specialized areas within magic, 
some include Elemental Magic, Sympathetic Magic, Herbalism, Aromatherapy, 
Healing, Shamanism and many others.  One of these areas which is generally 
thought of as the spell casting area of magic is Witchcraft.

Witchcraft

Witchcraft is a branch of magic that also deals with healing, protection, 
fertility, curses, hexes and the likes.  It is a branch of magic that is centered 
on techniques to improve the life of the practitioner and those around them.  
Those who practice Witchcraft or Wicca also tend to be of the Pagan religion, 
but this is not a requirement per&#39; say.

Origins

The true origins of witchcraft are impossible to state.  In it generally believe 
that Witchcraft had its origins in the beliefs of nature and animism held by primitive
 man during the Paleolithic era and earlier.  The earliest humans were part of a 
hunter/gatherer society.  To this level of culture, the things most important things 
to survival were the ability to find food (either through hunting or gathering from the land) 
and the reproduction of the species.
*==========================================================================*
Your eyes are powerful tools of power.  By just directing your attention, and
focusing your gaze you can instantly instill fear, intimidation, love etc.  The power
of the eye has been known for quite some time, and we&#39;re about to expose how
you can become aware of this power, and begin using it to your advantage today!

To begin to develop a piercing gaze, you&#39;ll need practice in front of the mirror.
Begin by staring at your self, eye ball to eye ball.  Try to pierce yourself with
your own concentration.  Allow your mind to gentle seep into your own eyes
and observe what flashes through &#39;your minds eye&#39;.  By increasing your awareness
of this magical vision which appears in your head while fixing your gaze upon
another&#39;s eyes - you begin to develop the Piercing Gaze.

A normal glance at someone is just that - a glance.  A quick visual judgment of
who they are, what mood they&#39;re in, what type of person they are likely to be
etc.  This are simple tasks for your brain to distinguish with just a normal glance.

However to know the secrets of that persons past, future and present you must
develop the Piercing Gaze.  After sufficient practice in front of the mirror at
observing your minds eye images, you can begin to practice on other people.

Next time your in public, make it a goal to try to pry apart a persons outer visade&#39; 
and take a shortcut into right into the depths of the their soul through their eyes.

&quot;Eyes are the window&#39;s to your soul.&quot; - What a true statement this is.  Not only
are they windows, but they are Cannons as well - capable to blasting out sub-
atomic energy which can instantly change the state of your intended target.

Now you know how to begin using the power of your eyes to decipher another
person&#39;s soul secrets as well as instantly change their state by simply fixating your
gaze on them and instilling a picture in your minds eye.

On a personal note, I&#39;ve been doing this ability for quite some time now.  Just the
other day it had a phenomenal payout...

Our neighbors have a set of mean pit bulls.  The kind of pit bulls that will eat your
cat if it steps a foot in their yard.  None the less, the larger of the two happened 
to get out of their backyard the other day.

Well about the same time he got out, I decided to go for a walk.  About 20 feet
in front of my house they dog spotted me and started to rush me like he was
going to attack me!  Now if you know anything about pit bulls, than you know
being attacked by one is a very bad thing to say the least.

Despite the fact the dog was in the process of covering ground so he could
maul my face - for some reason I didn&#39;t have a shred of fear in my entire
body.  I felt my blood pressure stay the same as I centered myself trying
to keep my calm and coolness.

Well I could either turn around and run back to the house at this point, or stand
my ground and face off with a pit bull.  I knew there was no need to run,
Men rule beasts and I was about to show him just that.  With a snap of my wrist
I held out my hand like I was halting traffic and fixed my gaze directly unto his
showing him I was not afraid and was prepared to stand my ground and fight
if need be.

He continued to charge at me like a locomotive, until finally he came within
an arms reach from my hand - and then he stopped.  He stopped dead in 
his tracks, turned around and ran away.  Absolutely, positively a true story.

The dog went home, I went on about my walk.  Using my gaze alone I was
able to stop a attacking animal dead in it&#39;s tracks and go home.  Now that&#39;s
powerful magic.

ANCIENT HINDU SPELL FOR INVISIBILITY 

Lots of requests for [invisibility spells], so here&#39;s one I&#39;ve just come across. 
It&#39;s from the Srividyaarnavatantra, a Tantric manuscript dealing mainly with 
Tripuraasundari (and with Kali and some other goddesses to a lesser degree)
A process has been prescribed for making oneself invisible to others. 
With five wicks, one each made of the fibers of 
arka (Calatropis gigantea), 
shaalmali (Salmalia malabarica),
kaarpaasa (Gossypium heraceum) [i.e. cotton], 
patta (cloth), 
pankaja (lotus) [dipped in] narataila (human oil i.e., oil extracted from a corpse) 
one should kindle five lights. 

These should be placed, one by one, on five human skulls. Then the combined 
black ashes, obtained from the above lights, should be applied to the eyes 
while one is in a temple of Shiva. The ashes are first consecrated with the 
following mantra, recited 1008 times: Om hum phat kaali kaali mahaakaali 
maamsa-shonitam khaadaya khaadaya devi maa pasyatu manuseti hum phat svaahaa. 

*==========================================================================*
Put simply, if you are like 90% of the World&#39;s population, you&#39;ve 
been tricked.  If you are a part of one of the three biggest monotheistic
religions in the world Judaism, Christianity or  Islam - you&#39;ve been the
victim of a charade of symbolism taken literally to the point of a mass
delusion.

You&#39;ve been told that Heaven was a place that you go when you die if your
 good.  Hell was of course the opposite.  Angels were spirits that originated
 from Heaven and were servants or messengers of God.  Demons originate
 from the darkest pits of Hell, and servants for the Devil.  These were all
 things you were raised to believe; however, these concepts were taken
 WAY too seriously.

Now, the truth: Heaven and Hell are of the &#39;infernal&#39; variety.  What
 exactly does this mean?  As referred to by most High Magick teachings,
 &#39;infernal&#39; relates to the subconscious stratum of the human psyche.  
Spirits (Angles/Demons) inhabiting these regions would then be 
personifications of powers or energies that lie buried in our subconscious
minds - qualities of our consciousness that we have disowned or forgotten....</description>

<p>Explain how the earth came to be then - logically.<br>
Heres how man explains it:</p>
<p>First of all this big explosion happened. A big one.<br>
From that, all of these atoms magically dispersed, and formed different elements.<br>
Next, some clumps got together and made plannets - and some decided to be giant balls of burning gas.<br>
One of these clumps mysteriously landed the EXACT right distance away from the sun in order to be able to support life.<br>
Somehow, these atoms arranged themselves and created organic compounds.<br>
They then continued to change until they made living things.<br>
The living things then proceded to gain intelligence and eventually turned into humans.</p>
<p>Oh great - my great great^1000 grandfather was a rock. Cool.</p>

I dont really know any goths so excuse me if this sounds prejudice. Dont goths want chaos and evil rather than good? Dont they drink people’s blood?<br>
If not then why dont you explain what it means to be goth?<br>
I know some goths DONT worship the devil but they still love him. The devil is a symbol of evil and chaos, or is it?..<br>

<p>Whats wrong with blood? it tastes ok :)[/quote]</p>
<p>I understand your being sarcastic but dont you kill whoever’s blood you drink?</p>
