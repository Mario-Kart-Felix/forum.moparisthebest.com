    <title>Need help connecting with client!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-connecting-with-client/116914</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve deobbed everything from the client, and now I want to get it so that I can use it when I compile it. Right now, it doesn&#39;t work shit. I used to know how to do it, but I left the cheating scene for maybe a year or so. 

I can&#39;t connect to the server, it won&#39;t let me. It won&#39;t even let me open the applet. Help greatly appreciated.</description>
