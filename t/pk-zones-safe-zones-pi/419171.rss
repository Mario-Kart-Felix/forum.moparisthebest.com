    <description>Hey people! I need help on my erasedpkz source. I was wondering on how i can make pk and safe zones in lumbridge.
I&#39;m struggerling with making it. Could any of you help me out? I&#39;ve tryed many tuts not worked.

I want the outside of the lumbridge castle walls (past the gate in castle bit), and the outside just for pking!

Anyone help me with some codes? I&#39;ve spent ages on this! Only thing i&#39;m struggerling with! 

I would be so happy if you could help.
Thanks</description>
