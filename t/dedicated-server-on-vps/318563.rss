<p>RDC to the desktop and set it up. They should of emailed you the Ipadress and all your details, if not then wait, some companys take up to 24 hours to process your request. Most companys forward there ports automatically (Well the vps company i use does) so it’s just a case of downloading and installing JDk, and putting the server online, just use the vps’s ip or they should give you an option for <a href="http://something.therething.com" rel="nofollow noopener">something.therething.com</a> you can use, or you could use NO-IP.[/quote]I hope so cause I would like to set it up now to give my laptop a break but o well but is there any way I can do it through ssh? I can access it with ssh but not through RDC</p>

<p>It should take time for them to set it up unless there Administrator is on at that exact time. You’d have to wait, also with my vps i got 2 control panels for options like restarting the vps,  bandwith use, RAM use, and processes running ect. Make sure you use a correct email so they can send you your control panel details. Also if you’re hosting of a laptop you need to get a cooling pad. I would never host of my laptop. Just keep checking your inbox.[/quote]i got a email about my log in info is that what i need?</p>
