<p><code>if (c.getPA().character-look ==/*&lt;=you can change these around*/ 92 &amp;&amp; etcetcetc) {

<p>That’s extremely rough, so you’ll need to get the correct ints for the character-look and make sure that sendCrashFrame method is right cause IDK if that’s right and I CBF to check it myself. :I[/quote]</p>
<p>You could just lock your client down so only the smart ones can hack it.</p>
