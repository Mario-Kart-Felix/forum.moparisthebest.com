    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bs-ix-client-jarring-issue/463490</link>
    <description>I am working on a slightly edited version of innovationx and i wanted to make the webclient now before i put to much time into it... 

I have jarred many clients before and had no problem at all, but when i jar this one everything goes fine,
When i have finished i click it and nothing happens.

Its really irritating me lol...

Any help or suggestions appreciated..
