    <title>[317] Custom weapons and PvP [317] Rewarding answerer with Scoobie Snack</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-custom-weapons-and-pvp-317-rewarding-answerer-with-scoobie-snack/311104</link>
    <description>I haven&#39;t coded long, maybe a month [and that was short after Winterlove&#39;s first release long ago :p]
So I am kinda in the dark here.  I have looked through the coding but I have yet to understand anything besides a bit here and there.  Any help is appreciated, I&#39;m becoming fond of custom modelling :D</description>
