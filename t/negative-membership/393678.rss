    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/negative-membership/393678</link>
    <description>What is this?

Is there a reason BOTH of my accounts have negative membership?

I mean, don&#39;t get me wrong I&#39;ve botted a little, but its not enough to get caught (and I use good bots).

Do you think someone refunded my membership (because I got it from someone&#39;s pin)</description>

Yeah I know that now. i didn’t even know you could dispute it with your phone company.[/quote]<br>
All you gotta do is dispute it with them that you did not authorize that payment/call, and attempt to get it refunded.</p>

<p>So when Jagex come to take your payment for the month they cant so in there eyes you owe them a months membership hence the negative.</p>
