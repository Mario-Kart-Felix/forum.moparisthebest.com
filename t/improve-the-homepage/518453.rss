    <title>Improve the homepage</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/improve-the-homepage/518453</link>
    <description>I know I don&#39;t speak only for myself when I say that the homepage is just not fit for purpose as the homepage to this site.

Firstly, it doesn&#39;t fit the theme of the site. MoparScape has a blue theme, the well-established one on the forums. If the webclient had been placed on a blue page with a similar style to that of the forum, it would have been fit for purpose as a homepage because it was directly related to the site, useful, and would have had a similar style to the forum. However, it had a very different style (being placed on an all-black page) and so removed the user, in effect, from the site by removing the common style. Why is the new site doing the exact same thing? The MoparScape forum theme is styled to allow multiple posts and therefore would be suitable for use as the theme for a blog - why is this not so? Why does the homepage use a completely different style to the forum and, again, removes the user from the site.

Secondly, what does a site based around RuneScape Private Server development and to some extent programming in general blog about? The site at MITB tried to use a blog as a homepage and it got three posts (I think) between 2006 and 2013 - why will MoparScape be any different? MoparScape [b]entirely[/b] revolves around posts, so why do we need to have a blog system? If your answer is &quot;we need a blog to show announcements&quot;, then [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,112.0.html]look here[/url]. There is [b]no[/b] point having a blog for the forum, it has had one post in the past 9 days and even if it had more posts I would just click past it because the site has (effectively) not had a homepage for the past 6 years that I&#39;ve been using it, and so why would I take extra effort to look at one now? If your answer is &quot;to get useful news about the site&quot; then, again, [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,112.0.html]look here[/url]. The homepage will, in a best-case scenario, become a site to simply parrot what is put in the Announcements board, putting it in different words.</description>

<p>Yes, that theme looks good. It just needs to be a similar shade of blue so that the user links the two sites together in their head.</p>

              <p>Yea, I wouldn’t say it removes users from the site, but it could be better for sure. A homepage should be more like a portal to the entire community, not a blog. You can have a blog, but it shouldn’t be the main focus. It makes it look like the whole site is focused around the blog, and the forums are just an accessory when it should be the opposite.</p>
