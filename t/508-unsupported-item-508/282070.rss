    <title>[508] unsupported item [508]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-unsupported-item-508/282070</link>
    <description>Hi everyone. Im currently trying to make dragon claws in my 508 server (client). I dont have the models for the dragon claws so im using rune claws, but theres a problem with it. When I wield the rune claws in my run.bat it says &quot;Unsupported item: 3101&quot; (3101 = claws ID) and it wont wield the claws. btw thats the server run.bat not client. It happens with all claws and some other weapons also. I was wondering if anyone knew why this is happening. Please reply, thanks.

P.S. If anyone has the models for dragon claws you can post them here :P</description>
