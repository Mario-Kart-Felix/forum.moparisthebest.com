    <title>Decompiling the clients</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/decompiling-the-clients/215498</link>
    <description>So I tried decompiling some RSC private server clients. They had no obfuscation. I used DJ Java decompiler(which is based on JAD), also tried JAD by itself alone. They managed to decompile it, but with errors.

[code]Parsing mudclient.class...Parsing inner class mudclient$1.class... Generating mudclient.java
Couldn&#39;t resolve all exception handlers in method handleIncomingPacket
Couldn&#39;t resolve all exception handlers in method getServerStatus[/code]

For example this.
I even tried with a client that I had source for that eliminate the obfuscation possibility. Same thing.

Any suggestions on decompilers? JODE totally fucked up itself.</description>

              <p>I have the raw client’s src files, except it needs the mina and xstream class files with it which that didn’t come, so i tried to download a few different versions of mina/xstream and they just were not clinging. Even decompiled xstream/mina from rscd’s client, fixed some errors and tried using them, unfortunately it did not work.</p>
