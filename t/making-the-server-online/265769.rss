    <title>Making the server online</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-the-server-online/265769</link>
    <description>Before christmas, I was making a server everything worked. I downloaded No-ip and did what i needed to do on that side, and I put my server online without portforwarding this only alloud people connected the internet I was connected to, This is what i wanted just so I could edit my server and see what I needed to add or fix.

Now I have a new computer and I&#39;v done the same but when I tick the box on No-ip and click &#39;Run&#39; In my server files, It says &#39;&#39;Error Connected To Server&#39;&#39; On the client log-in page.

How do I get it online just for my internet use (Without Portforwarding) ?

Thanks in advance.</description>
