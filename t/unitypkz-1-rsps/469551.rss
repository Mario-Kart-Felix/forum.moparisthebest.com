[b]UnityPkz[/b]
We stand for quality, we have and always will. We try to minimize the downtime and create a lagg free environment. With all skills fully working and a completely re-designed combat system which is one of the most accurate out there to this day, we are happy to say that our players love Inception. With the daily compliments we get ingame and on the forums, and with the suggestions posted, we keep Inception growing and holding weekly updates.

[b]We guarentee you will:[/b]
-Enjoy our new combat system to the max. A Completely re-designed combat system that is one of the most accurate of all private servers.
-Find yourself within an active PKing community.
-Find yourself being able to level all skills. Every skill is fully working (Wilderness Agility as well for example).
-Have an awesome time within our active community and staff.

[b]Server features[/b]
We would like to globally name a few of our many attractions, if we were to name them all, the list would be too long! In short:
-Worldwide skilling (And a member skill island)
-Active Pking all around the server
-Plenty of bosses in wilderness and non wilderness
-Advanced Pk point system, the higher wilderness level -&gt; the more points
-Castle Wars
-Double Xp weekends
-::shop area for all your supplies
-::train area for beginner training
-Fight pits for fun dueling
-Safe Pk (dieing and you wont lose anything!)
-Active Wiki for all information
-Gaming to the max

[b]Client features[/b]
We have adjusted our Client to make it suitable for everybody. Everybody wants to have a choice wether to keep old features such as the old hp bar or the regular hits, and there are people that prefer the new RS ones. This is all possible. Let&#39;s list a few of these features.

Ability to:
-Choose the HP bar or the old one
-Choose the new RS F keys (to switch) or hold the old ones
-Choose x10 damage ingame or the regular hits
-Choose the new hitmarks (melee, range, mage) or hold the original 07 RS ones

[b]Forum features[/b]
Our forum is THE place if you want to become part of the community. You can always drop by and leave an introduction, chat with fellow Inceptionists in our shoutbox or even talk with them via our Ventrilo.
There are some other features of our forum such as:
-Appeal/Report player section
-PK Videos and achievements sections
-Announcements to keep you updated daily on the improvements we make
-General discussion: for your daily talk about Inception
-Help section: if you have any issues while trying to play Inception or ingame
issues, feel free to post here so we can help out
