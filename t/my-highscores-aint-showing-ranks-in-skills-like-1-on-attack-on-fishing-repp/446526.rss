    <description>Hey my Highscores (I belive i can link you to it, cuz its not to my server)
http://www.highscores.lastdivine.com/

Does work with who is the #1 on the server but it doesn&#39;t show ranks on individual Skills.
Is this the fault of HiscoresHandler.java on server side.

Or is it the problem with the uploaded php scrips?


( I already used this php scrips for my other highscores, they worked fine)

The only thing i changed this time is HiscoresHandler, But i can&#39;t belive its the fault of that,
well it has to be.

Help plz ;)</description>
