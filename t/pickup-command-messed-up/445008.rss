    <title>::Pickup Command Messed Up</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pickup-command-messed-up/445008</link>
    <description>Okay, so ever since I made my ::pickup command for admins and owners only, it says, &quot;Oops! Use as ::pickup 995 100&quot;. The command that I was originally trying to use still works though. So for example, if I use, &quot;::yell hi&quot; this is what shows up.

However, if I type &quot;::yell 1050 1&quot;, it will spawn me a Santa Hat and yell the message, &quot;1050 1&quot;. This wouldn&#39;t normally bother me, but I encountered a more serious problem with this. Say you use, &quot;::pickup 4875345 98475938475&quot;, you would lag out. That&#39;s what happens to me when I use too many characters in any command.. Not only do I lag out, but the command does not even execute, making most of my commands impossible to use. Here is my line of code for my ::pickup command.

[code]            } 

	    if(command.startsWith(&quot;pickup&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights == 2 || playerRights == 3){
		        String[] args = command.split(&quot; &quot;);
	         if(args.length == 3) {
			int newItemID = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);[/code]

Also, I forgot to mention that this problem only occurs to owners, which is playerRights 3. Can anyone please help me? Thanks.</description>

<p>Are you missing a few lines of code?</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">				int newItemAmount = Integer.parseInt(args[2]);
				if (newItemID &lt;= 160000 &amp;&amp; newItemID &gt;= 0) {
					addItem(newItemID, newItemAmount);
				} else {
					sM("No such item.");
				}
			} else {
				sM("Oops! Use as ::item 995 100");
			}
		}
	}</code></pre>
<p>Edit: Also, maybe you could do this :</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (command.startsWith("pickup") &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; playerRights &lt; 4) {</code></pre>
