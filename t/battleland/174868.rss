    <description>Hi, and welcome to the newest server created by RuneScape yet! This server is run on 2 beautifully dedicated servers, each with 2.5GB RAM EACH! That means 24/7 game time with NO LAGG AT ALL!

Please keep in mind that the whole week today will be used for testing so accounts may get reset. However, I&#39;ll keep the account files stored and if the testing passes through, accounts won&#39;t be reset.

History: This server was founded in 2005 and improved since then. It was released a few times to different websites but people didn&#39;t know about it yet.

We then had a official release about 6 months ago and it was great until the person hosting it left. Our team then set on improving it and raising money for dedication. We now have enough to host it for a year!

Server ip- Battleland.no-ip.org
Port: 43594 (default)

Features:
24/7 up-time
Supports 200+ people (tested)
Almost ALL working skills, specs, effects, ect..
A BRAND NEW skill soon coming out.

Server pics coming soon![br][br][size=1]Posted on: January 20, 2008, 03:49:50 PM[/size][hr]I want people to join to see if its going to work, post here when you tried it out.</description>
