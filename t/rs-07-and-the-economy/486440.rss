+1, this is why I don’t play RSPS unless it’s a pk server.</p>
<p>I hope theirs rare and third age (in circulation), I like it because it’s a lil side goal to go for. I personally only own a rare for about 12 hours once every few months so it’s not a big deal but they look nice and I feel they should be in the game. The rarity of 3a is insane, when theirs no 3a in the game at all it’s just going to turn into 3a druidic 6b (basically an insane value) a piece (allegedly, I haven’t checked myself).</p>
<p>I’m not looking forward to the training etc but yeah. Hopefully they’ll do a DXP week or something to kick-start things, not on a regular bases like it currently is -.-.</p>

I don’t see the point in it then, you lose everything and once everyone gets over that nostalgic feeling i doubt they would want to play.<br>
[/quote]<br>
If that was true then RSPS wouldn’t even exist.[/quote]<br>
RSPS has more to offer, such as faster exp, money, armour ect. People achieve more on rsps which is why they stay, that and because of the community within that server.</p>

It’s pretty exciting for me. A fresh start for everyone, hopefully no rares to bombard he economy, it will be fun<br>
[/quote]If rares were to come out anyways, the street price woudl be at 40m like old days. Hopefully. :)[/quote]<br>
They’d probably skyrocket like no tomorrow considering how many people would want them though so probably alot higher even IF they add rares</p>

The day it opens I can pretty much guarantee bots will be out full force. Last time I played their bot detection was poor, and there is going to be A LOT of money to be made by selling resources to players trying to be the first in 99s. It’s an opportunity for players to remake history, and I’m sure there will be people who are willing to hit the top in a 99 by any means necessary.</p>
<p>I honestly can’t see them adding rares, but if they did then I doubt their price would be anything close to what it was in 2007. The amount of people that would be trying to hoard as many rares as humanly possible would flood the market (They were just dropped on the floor nearby players in cities correct?). Players realize the value of having discontinued items, so they will just get as many as they can, which will in turn create a massive amount of these rares. If anything they will probably make them untrade-able or something.<br>
[/quote]But, where will the GP come from? There’s no GE. So, everything is going to be a barter economy.[/quote]<br>
Resources for real money. Obviously RS06 isn’t the same as real rs but they had quite a good deal of money already in game, but imagine that on a 100x scale. 200,000+ people playing the game will create quite a good amount of money in a short amount of time.</p>
<p>The moment bots can do natures they will run the price of natures low, players will buy them up and alch again. This time there is no gold sink like dungeoneering, only con. There will be no massive outlet for gp to be removed from the game.</p>

You have the knowledge and experience to redo those easily I’m sure. I remember doing them back in like 2005 and such, then I redid them a couple years ago. I breezed through them so easily.</p>

              <p>The day it opens I can pretty much guarantee bots will be out full force. Last time I played their bot detection was poor, and there is going to be A LOT of money to be made by selling resources to players trying to be the first in 99s. It’s an opportunity for players to remake history, and I’m sure there will be people who are willing to hit the top in a 99 by any means necessary.</p>
<p>I honestly can’t see them adding rares, but if they did then I doubt their price would be anything close to what it was in 2007. The amount of people that would be trying to hoard as many rares as humanly possible would flood the market (They were just dropped on the floor nearby players in cities correct?). Players realize the value of having discontinued items, so they will just get as many as they can, which will in turn create a massive amount of these rares. If anything they will probably make them untrade-able or something.</p>
