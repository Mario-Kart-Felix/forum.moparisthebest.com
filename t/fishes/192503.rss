<p>Fishing is almost as bad as Crafting, although probably still the best method of money besides slaying / clues it is getting pretty fucked up, in the past week Nat prices went down to 266ea @ G.E, and Ess went to 144gp.

<p>That is because if some rich dude irl went out and bought 5 accounts with 2b each on it, he could set any item to any price he wanted (via buying them and high alching them, raising the price). They only thing he couldnt do is lower the price. Basically my point is, items change depending on how much of them are sold and boughten each day. Jagex did a good job making the only economical stabilizer in runescape based upon supply and demand.</p>

              <p>I’ve never been there but most of the videos I’ve watched it looks pretty good. It sicks that you get a target  but I think you might not be able to but you can kill people that arn’t your Target, you get a 180 penalty for killing someone who’s not your target and if your really unlucky you could have up to 4 people attacking you, your target, the person who has to kill you and two other random people…</p>
<p>EDIT - Its single way now you can only have 2 people attack you, your target and the person who’s target is you.</p>
<p>EDIT 2 - I think…</p>
<p>EDIT 3 - Yup confirmed.</p>
