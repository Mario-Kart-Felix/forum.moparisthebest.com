    <description>My server was being ddosed so I bought another vps that had ddos protection and re-registered on the toplist and got banned for around 20 days. (or 3 weeks)

I got banned for &quot;spamming&quot; the toplist, I had no intention in spamming the toplist, I can&#39;t post on the toplist now as mopar doesn&#39;t let you change ips for servers so now im stuck at offline for 2 weeks until i drop to 40% or I will probably have to wait 3 weeks for the ban to lift.

edit: proof - http://prntscr.com/3ctab3

sorry if I sound arrogant/rude i&#39;m just annoyed, whichever mod banned me clearly isn&#39;t doing his/her job properly and just giving out 3 week bans thinking anyone who readds their server must clearly have an intention of spamming it, my site log shows mopar gives me more visitors than many other toplists so now my server is struggling for no reason, hence why i&#39;m annoyed.</description>

Your best bet at this point is to appeal to an administrator via the private message feature.<br>
