    <title>What items did you scam?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-items-did-you-scam/379706</link>
    <description>Ahhhh the good old day back in 05, back then to make my money all i would do is scam (since ppl in rs are dumb)

My first big scam was scamming a santa hat, then full rune. (Back then full rune was alot) I also remember the third biggest thing i scammed was Fully Addy (g)

Trust game:
Items iv gotten from scamming people with the trust game:
Pumpkin
Rune (g) platebody 
over 60m cash
and finally a Disk of Returning.

Later in the years my account got perminantly banned...  :( 
It wasn&#39;t all for scamming, most of it was for password scamming :&#39;( but my account is now unbanned some how (even though it said perm.) but had nothing in the bank but holiday items :((( (non tradeable)

So, post all the items you scammed including trust game, i wanna see what you guys have gotten! : D</description>

              <p>My maximum losses in the trust game, Full bronze XD<br>
The guy was a level 39 scamming people off their stoof… I had him on my friends list and begged him for my items every day. Finally, he pmed me saying he was quitting and gave me full Mithril.<br>
I was level 69 with full rune by then…</p>

<p>Good luck.<br>
I’m guessing they’ll leave the “Recommended wealth transfer” or whatever you want to call it (meaning, it will display the wealth transfer average; but you have the freedom to go whichever way you like).<br>
Also, there’s the (!!!) removal notification in trade.</p>

              <p>Ahhhh the good old day back in 05, back then to make my money all i would do is scam (since ppl in rs are dumb)</p>
<p>My first big scam was scamming a santa hat, then full rune. (Back then full rune was alot) I also remember the third biggest thing i scammed was Fully Addy (g)</p>
<p>Trust game:<br>
Items iv gotten from scamming people with the trust game:<br>
Pumpkin<br>
Rune (g) platebody<br>
over 60m cash<br>
and finally a Disk of Returning.</p>
<p>Later in the years my account got perminantly banned…  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
It wasn’t all for scamming, most of it was for password scamming :’( but my account is now unbanned some how (even though it said perm.) but had nothing in the bank but holiday items :((( (non tradeable)</p>
<p>So, post all the items you scammed including trust game, i wanna see what you guys have gotten! : D</p>
