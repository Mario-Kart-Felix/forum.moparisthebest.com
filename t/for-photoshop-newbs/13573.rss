    <title>For photoshop newbs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/for-photoshop-newbs/13573</link>
    <description>Here is a super simple tut for all photoshop newbs that don&#39;t have a clue what they are doing.


Fonts:

If you see fonts you like such as &quot; the spiderman font &quot; or &quot; the godfather font &quot; Then you can now use these on your edition of photoshop cs2 all you have to do, to find the font you like is visit www.dafont.com www.1001fonts.com and you search for the font you like and download it. Then when you have downloaded the font put the (fontname).TTf folder in your fonts folder in control panel.

Renders:

If you are making a sig and you think it would go better with a render then go to www.planetrenders.com and go to renders gallery then search for the render you want e.g spiderman. then you search for it and make it full size. Then right click it or save it and go to photoshop and open that in its own doccument and get the magic wand out and click the grey/black/white spaces in the background of the render. And when they are selected you hit delete. Now do this to all the black/grey/white spaces in the background.

Backgrounds:

I mostly use brushes for backgrounds wich i downloaded for the graphics forum in complete ps resources posted by mr.chris. So download these and install them into your photoshop brushes.Then select your brush and change the colour for various effects.

Text effects:

type your text and in the layer info on the right hand side right click it and goto blending options.then select random things to make it look better =)

Hosting:

once you have made your picture go to www.tinypic.com and host it =)


Installing brushes:

download the brushes you like and go to my computer&gt;c drive&gt;program files&gt; adobe &gt; photoshop &gt;presets&gt;brushes&gt;photoshop only brushes and put them all in there :)

Hopefully this will help you :)
