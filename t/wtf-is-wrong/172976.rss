    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wtf-is-wrong/172976</link>
    <description>i am almost done with my server so i try and test it by loging in with 2 accounts on the same pc. so i have 1 guy kill another. to simplify my question, the 2 people will be represented as a and b.
so A kills B. (i have both screens open each taking up half the screen)

now heres the problem. on A&#39;s screen, player B is still standing there after he was killed. on player B&#39;s screen, he teled to the bank like he was supposed to. i couldnt fix it. on 1 screen theres a guy in the bank and in the other hes next to a guy. help!
