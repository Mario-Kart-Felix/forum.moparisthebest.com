    <title>RENAMED and NON RENAMED Coding Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/renamed-and-non-renamed-coding-help/433562</link>
    <description>Hello,

So I added some cheat commands to my RENAMED client. The cheat commands were from a NON RENAMED client. For example I added clickobject. Here is that void...

(I have no Idea if this is related to the two voids down below)
[code]      public void clickobject(int object)
   {
   fakemouse(0);
      System.out.println(&quot;Clicking &quot;+object);
int rtx = ((Class30_Sub2_Sub4_Sub1) (aClass30_Sub2_Sub4_Sub1_Sub2_1126)).anInt1550;
int rtx2 = ((Class30_Sub2_Sub4_Sub1) (aClass30_Sub2_Sub4_Sub1_Sub2_1126)).anInt1551;
int lol1 =   anInt1036 + (rtx - 6 &gt;&gt; 7);
int lol2 =   anInt1035 + (rtx2 - 6 &gt;&gt; 7);
         aClass30_Sub2_Sub2_1192.method397((byte)6, 132);
            aClass30_Sub2_Sub2_1192.method433(0, lol1);
            aClass30_Sub2_Sub2_1192.method399(object);
            aClass30_Sub2_Sub2_1192.method432(-431, lol2);
   }[/code]


So I added it to my RENAMED client and I fixed all of those bloody errors and even added multiple NON RENAMED classes from my NON RENAMED client to my RENAMED client in order to get it to work. I did not change any of the actual code, just added ints, booleans, voids, methods, classes, etc. So right now I have 0 errors. I run my client and when I go to my gui and click on click object, it give me the dialogue, just like it would in the other client. I enter the number ID and it just says &quot;Click Object: 2213&quot; but in the actual server it is doing nothing. Also, If I click on click object in the gui again, after a put the ID number in it will tell me 


&quot;[08:17:02]: Click Object: 2213
[08:17:02]: You must enter a numeric value! java.lang.NullPointerException&quot;


So my question is how can I make it so it is actually clicking the objects and not just saying it.


Here are the other main things I added: (IN BotGUI.java)






[code]         public void ObjectClickButton()
      {
      try
      {
String                s1 = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(this, (new StringBuilder()).append(&quot;Click Object &quot;), &quot;Enter Object&quot;, 3);
               if(s1 == null)
                        {
                            System.out.println(&quot;Canceled&quot;);
                        } else
                        if(s1.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;&quot;))
                        {
                            System.out.println(&quot;Sorry, have to have some input&quot;);
                        } else
                        {
                            System.out.println((new StringBuilder()).append(&quot;Click Object: &quot;).append(s1).toString());
                      clickobject(Integer.parseInt(s1));
                        }
                    }
                    catch(Exception e)
                    {
                        System.out.println((new StringBuilder()).append(&quot;You must enter a numeric value! &quot;).append(e).toString());


         }      }[/code]


[code]               if(cmd.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Object Click&quot;)){
         ObjectClickButton();
         }
[/code]


So if anyone could help me, that would me amazing! 


p.s. if anyone has a clickobject renamed void could you post it? I couldn&#39;t find a renamed cheat client.</description>
