</aside>
<p>Umm not really.  Yeah it has an 8 speed and more power, but its also a lot heavier, and has worse handling.  It would probably lose on a track.</p>

</aside>
<p>According to these two ‘statistics’ websites:<br>
<a href="http://www.leftlanenews.com/new-car-buying/dodge/charger-srt8/#specs" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://www.leftlanenews.com/new-car-buying/dodge/charger-srt8/#specs</a><br>

<p>The charger weighs 4365 lbs, while the BMW weighs 3362 lbs, for a difference of 1003 lbs.  Now I’ve always heard that for each 100lbs, you subtract 10hp (don’t know how that figures into torque), so even if you subtract 100hp from the charger:</p>
<p>Charger: 470 HP, 470 ft-lb<br>
BMW: 230 HP, 200 ft-lb</p>
<p>So adjusted to make weight identical, it’s still 370 HP vs 230 HP, with well over 2 times the torque.  It also has substantially wider tires and puts more rubber to road.  The charger still wins hands down.</p>
<p>Also, I don’t know what kind of brakes the BMW has, but the Charger has huge Brembo brakes all the way around, it’ll stop on a dime.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Charge will win in a straight line, oh wait heres the dumb thinking that seeing which car can go faster in a straight line actually matters</p>
<p>Oh and your comparing a 46k charger vs a 34k bmw? Your always the one complaining about how much more “foreign cars” are than “american” cars</p>
<p>So for the same price we could get the 335i coupe with a 300hp engine and 300ft-lb of torque at 1200rpm[/quote]</p>
<p>A standard Charger R/T with the 5.7L V8 Hemi starts at $29,995 and it would beat the standard BMW 300 series as well, the SRT8 would certainly win against that ‘335i coupe’ as well.</p>
<p>I also think it would handle just as well or better than the BMW on curves as well.  We aren’t talking about the old 50s, 60s, and 70s mopar’s that I love that couldn’t corner worth a shit, all of the new suspensions are designed from the ground up with modern technology and can corner like nobody’s business.  My 2007 Charger SRT8 can corner so hard that the seat belts actually hurt me without so much as squealing a tire.</p>
<p>edit:<br>
<a class="mention" href="/u/luxury">@Luxury</a>, the seats are the nicest I’ve ever seen.  Black leather with red stitching and grey suede center portions, very comfortable too. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>That link is broken, so I can’t see the cadillac, but Dodge has been beating this car for years with their SRT8 line of cars, like the Charger, 300 etc etc.  The price is the same or cheaper, and with over twice the horsepower and torque.  The 2012 Charger is going to have even more power, and an 8 speed automatic transmission.  No contest.</p>

              <p>Wonder if Cadillac managed to design an engine that doesnt burn oil, probably not though because the tolerances on american made vehicles are horrible. For the exterior at least the bmw is still a better looking car and for the interior I think Cadillac takes that but overall I would take the bmw 3 series long before I would consider the cadicallc. Not saying the bmw 3 series are perfect but they have some small issues that are easy to avoid and inexpensive to fix.</p>
