    <title>Any programming books, Websites or recommendations?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/any-programming-books-websites-or-recommendations/552406</link>
    <description>Hi there,

I have been getting back into Java this past year as we have begun to touch upon it for my second year of uni. I really enjoy programming in Java and I have a good grasp of the basics of and OOP. Flicking around these forums and seeing the skills and knowledge some of you have literally blows my mind. Recently I have been looking around for tutorials and have found some great videos and some great stuff on the web but I was hoping that some of you may be able to give some suggestions/recommendations to some of the places you found best to learn. I know there are some stickies with tutorials but there are a few specific things that I would personally like to cover. I am interested in 2D/3D graphic applications as well as complex applications. So my main questions is what are the best ways to advance my basic knowledge of math and programming so I can actually understand wtf you guys are on about? :L What were you best techniques in improving your skills? I have the time to put into it so books, websites or suggested libraries to look into.

I know this is a bit of an ambiguous question but I will happily look through what you throw at me.</description>

[/quote]Absolutely not. I just checked the thread out; good in concept - horribly maintained. I tested every link in that thread and these two are the only one’s that work:<br>
<a href="http://www.oopweb.com/CPP/Documents/ThinkingInCpp2/VolumeFrames.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.oopweb.com/CPP/Documents/ThinkingInCpp2/VolumeFrames.html</a> - Thinking in C++ Volume 2<br>
<a href="http://uploading.com/files/get2/NLAF0JI7/1" rel="nofollow noopener">http://uploading.com/files/get2/NLAF0JI7/1</a> - VB eBook Part 3<br>
Why that thread is still a sticky is beyond me.</p>
<p>As for OP:<br>
I recommend <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reallybigindex.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Oracle’s Really Big Index</a> as a basis of learning.[/quote]</p>
<p>This is perfect thank you <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Anyone else reading this with good suggestions let me know. As mentioned by EcoPS the sticky link has not been maintained so unfortunately is of no help.</p>
