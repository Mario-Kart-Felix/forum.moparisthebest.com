              <p>Uh… What?</p>
<p>You mean you have a folder full of compiled java files (your .class files) and you don’t know how to use them?</p>
<p>Well first off, make sure the ones you want to use are a main class (meaning in it’s .java equivalent it has the method “main”). Then you can use an IDE to run it, or a .bat file (Windows).</p>
<p>In the IDE you’d just open the file and hit run.<br>
For the batch (.bat file) you need to set it up based on your Environmental Variables (EV’s) and the directory the files are in.</p>
<p>If you don’t have EV’s set up, then you’ll be using something similar to:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">@echo off
TITLE Run...
"C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\java.exe" className args-go-here
pause</code></pre>
<p>className would be replaced with the one you wanted to run (Again, make sure it has a main class or it won’t work)<br>
args-go-here would be replaced depending on whether or not the class needs/uses them. If it doesn’t need them or doesn’t use them, remove the phrase entirely. If it does use them, replace it with what it requires (This is class specific so I can’t help much more than that).</p>
<p>And the java.exe can be replaced with javaw if needed. (Doubtful though).</p>
<p>If you do have EV’s set up on your computer, replace the everything in the quotes (including them) with <span class="bbcode-u">java</span> or <span class="bbcode-u">javaw</span> (no quotes on these).</p>
