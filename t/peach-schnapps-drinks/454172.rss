    <title>Peach Schnapps Drinks</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/peach-schnapps-drinks/454172</link>
    <description>Okay so I am trying to find some good, AFFORDABLE mixed drinks using Peach Schnapps. I got a big bottle from a friend last night and I have like no  earthly clue what is &quot;cheap&quot;.

I would like to stay within a 12-13$ budget if possible :) 

I prefer sweeter drinks but not required. Most of the stuff I am seeing online require several ingredients to get just the right taste. 

edit: he also stated if I wanted I could get it swapped for his Apple Schnapps but I prefer Peach personally so if you know of a good/inexpensive one for apple list that one as well</description>
