<p>SunUltraSPARC isn’t linux it’s the Solaris 10 install CD it just uses Gnome as it’s Desktop Environment.</p>

</aside>
<p>That isn’t true, linux can be compiled to run on the SPARC architecture, for example you can download ubuntu that is pre-compiled for it.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/xspikeyhairx">@xspikeyhairx</a>, you want the x86 architecture for standard computers, even if you have a 64bit processor x86 programs will run on it.  If you need anything else I will try to help you. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

If you’re not sure what everything means, I don’t suggest you start using linux right away, you could potentially wipe your hard drive if you’re not wanting too. If you don’t understand the terms maybe you should do your research before you jump into this stuff.</p>
<p>SunUltraSPARC isn’t linux it’s the Solaris 10 install CD it just uses Gnome as it’s Desktop Environment. If you’ve downloaded the Live CD .Iso and you’ve burned it, put it in the disk drive and restarted your computer, it booted the CD and you’re in the Ubuntu menu, you want to click “Start or Install Ubuntu” that will boot into Ubuntu from the CD and from there you can play around with Ubuntu, or install it. now if you don’t know your computers specs and you picked it out, I’m sure yours is a standard computer not something real fizzy. Look at the front of your computer, look at the stickers, usually if you get a Gfx card they give you a sticker to put on the front. if it says AMD 64bit then you have that.<br>
[/quote]<br>
You see I’ve downloaded the standard version and I’ve made 5 different cd’s and they all dot he same thing. And I’m using ImgBurn to make the CD’s and when im already running the computer the cd works fine- it pops up with that window telling you about linux. And I am ready to install linux…</p>
<ol>
<li>I have done nothing but programming for the past 10 years.</li>
<li>My father, Older brother and I, are all programmers. My father works for Keen and is now stationed in Abott Labs in Chicago. So dont tell me I dont know what I’m doing considering my father who works for one of the biggest companys as a computer programmer who has used over 30 different computer languages (mite be a little over exagerated but very close to there) and my brother who works for Aspen Marketing Who has been called a Genies by many different Computer company’s for his work and projects he has done single handedly have tought me everything I know about computers today.<br>
And about the stickers On the front… I built my computer. Im useing a Xion Solaris Case With An AMD Procesor, 4 gigs of ram, a 750gig hard disk, a sounblaster max sound card, geforce 8800 256 mb video card and some other junk i threw in there such as ethernet conection etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>and when I try to go into the install ubuntu thing it just resets my computer.</p>
<p>So all I was asking is if I am useing the corect type of ubuntu.[/quote]From the way you act, I’m afraid I’m going to have to call bullshit on you.</p>

              <p>When you spell “Genies” wrong, it really doesn’t support your credibility. I was merely keeping you from causing danger to your computer. If you were a programmer for 10 years, I doubt you would have an issue burning an .iso we have 10 year olds here that can do it. So why don’t you shove your made up experience right up your pompous ass.</p>
