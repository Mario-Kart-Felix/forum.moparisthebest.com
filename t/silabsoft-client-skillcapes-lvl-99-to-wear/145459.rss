    <description>Okay so i have silabsoft client, all the items including skillcapes work, i made a command ::skillcape where u get a skillcape for any skill u have 99 and u can only get one(that&#39;s right i&#39;m a good coder, lol), but i am not sure how to make it so u need 99 in the skill to wear it.  You can only get the skillcape if u 99 in the skill, but people can trade them, and if anyone could either explain or give me the code to make it so u need to be 99 in skill to wear skillcape i would greatly appreciate it.</description>
