    <title>Any one still play EoC?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/any-one-still-play-eoc/522881</link>
    <description>Hey, since eoc came, I recently remembered an account left on one of my emails, its pretty good, I will post pictures in a few.
Its a pure with one defense, I went through the EoC tutorial thing and noticed its a P.O.S. Now.

So I have a few questions,
Does any one play? If so, add me I have 3 friends because I got hacked a year ago
-user name: Why 1 Def
Is members still worth it, with it being eight bucks now and all?
I got 99 rc when people used to run nats, is it still worth it to do that?
Last but not least *for now* is should I level defense, and if so, to what level?

P.s. someone should loan me 5m or something. Haha

Pics:

Does anyone here have a clan chat that I can join?

COMING SOON ;)</description>

When I was getting 99 when it came out, I was getting 1.5m+ xp per day at 85+.<br>

I was getting 90k-110k exp/h at 80 rc and I’ve heard rates of 140k exp at 99. When was it nerfed? I always thought it was those rates as those are extremely fast compared to say 45k exp/h making combination runes.[/quote]<br>

              <p>Hey, since eoc came, I recently remembered an account left on one of my emails, its pretty good, I will post pictures in a few.<br>
Its a pure with one defense, I went through the EoC tutorial thing and noticed its a P.O.S. Now.</p>
<p>So I have a few questions,<br>
Does any one play? If so, add me I have 3 friends because I got hacked a year ago<br>
-user name: Why 1 Def<br>
Is members still worth it, with it being eight bucks now and all?<br>
I got 99 rc when people used to run nats, is it still worth it to do that?<br>
Last but not least <em>for now</em> is should I level defense, and if so, to what level?</p>
<p>P.s. someone should loan me 5m or something. Haha</p>
<p>Pics:</p>
<p>Does anyone here have a clan chat that I can join?</p>
<p>COMING SOON <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
