              <p>If you mean by training prayer through bones, get a client that shows you the item IDs in your inventory and find the bone ID you are burying. Look in your server files for the item ID and you should be able to change the EXP amount there.</p>
<p>If that doesn’t work, look for the message when you bury the bones like</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">You bury the bones.</code></pre>
<p>That should bring something up, change the EXP there. If you find more than 1 result then yes, of course change the EXP there too.</p>
