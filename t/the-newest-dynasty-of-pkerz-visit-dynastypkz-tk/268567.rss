    <description>[size=30pt]Welcome to Dynastypkz!!!!!!!!!![/size]




It has been a long time since dynastypkz had to go down. We did not have enough current funding for our VPS hoster. 

But We hope to recruit new players since we lost them after our 3 month&#39;s of being down

We are excited to say that dynastypkz is now up and running and we are currently recruiting all new players

We imply a friendly environment for players and welcome you to register at our updated forums at  [url=http://dynastypkz.tk]http://dynastypkz.tk[/url]

As the owner named JUSTIN of dynasty pkz

Id like to give my apologies for the down time. But we welcome you to download our client. WE NEWLY ADDED D CLAWZ FTW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Thankyou for reading this update
