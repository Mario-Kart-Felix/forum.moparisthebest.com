    <title>Getting no-ip to work with a router</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-no-ip-to-work-with-a-router/9935</link>
    <description>i look and observed other people making servers, read tuts for about a week, didint ask questions but 1 or 2, and now i have a decent server up and running. BUT IT REQUIRES HAMACHI!  and this is annoying because not all people have hamachi, so i wanted to get a no-ip. so you say *no-ip would be my answer to this* right? well i cant get no-ip to work. i halfway know the problem. ok i am behind a router. i removed the router for 10 min and asked my friend to try the ip adress now. it worked. but when i have toe router connected, it doesnt work *and my moms bf says i need to keep the router up* so he can get on *dur*. i fowarded the ports on my router settings, and on my firewall. i even completely disabled my firewall in hopes of getting my no-ip to work. but still no hopw. anyone know the problem? if so can you please give me some advise? thanks.</description>
