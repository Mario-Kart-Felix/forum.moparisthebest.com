    <description>[u][b]What is Linux?[/b][/u]

Linux is a operating system made by a young student in Finland named Linus.
Linus had an interest in Minix, a small UNIX system, and decided to develop a system that exceeded the Minix standards. He began his work in 1991 when he released version 0.02 and worked steadily until 1994 when version 1.0 of the Linux Kernel was released. The kernel, at the heart of all Linux systems, is developed and released under the GNU General Public License and its source code is freely available to everyone. It is this kernel that forms the base around which a Linux operating system is developed. There are now literally hundreds of companies and organizations and an equal number of individuals that have released their own versions of operating systems based on the Linux kernel. More information on the kernel can be found at our sister site, LinuxHQ and at the official Linux Kernel Archives. The current full-featured version is 2.6 (released December 2003) and development continues.  

[u][b]Where can I get Linux?[/b][/u]

There are literally hundreds of places you can get Linux because there are hundreds of &quot;versions&quot; or distributions of Linux. If you think you might want Linux because you&#39;re considering alternatives to Microsoft Windows or Macintosh OS for everyday computer use, you may want to check out a version of Linux called &#39;Knoppix&#39;, which will boot from your CD drive and does not need to be installed. If you&#39;re interested in Linux for other reasons, we invite you to look at our list of Linux distributions. You&#39;ll likely find what you&#39;re looking for there.

[u][b]Is Linux a official company?[/b][/u]

There is no company called Linux. Linux is an operating system. There are many companies that develop Linux products and provide services based on Linux, but not one called Linux who &quot;controls&quot; the operating system.

[u][b]Can I have Windows and Linux on my computer?[/b][/u]

Yes, you can install both operating systems on your computer. This is known as dual-booting. It&#39;s important to point out that only one operating system boots at a time, so when you turn on your computer, you make the choice of running Linux or Windows during that session. If you&#39;re interested in running Windows programs under Linux you should is the FAQ below.

[u][b]Can I run Window progams under Linux?[/b][/u]

The short answer to this is: no, not automatically and not directly. That is to say, Microsoft Windows and Linux applications cannot run the same applications because they are not designed in the same way. However, there are some ways to run programs for Microsoft Windows on Linux using emulators and other means. If you need/want to run an application designed for Microsoft Windows on Linux, you might want to check out the following application: 

[*][url=http://www.winehq.org/]WineHQ[/url]

[u][b]What is WineHQ?[/b][/u]

[color=blue]Wine is not something you run, you run applications with it. Simply open your applications and Wine should be loaded to run them automatically. You can configure your wine environment by running winecfg, and you can browse your fake windows drive at ~/.wine/drive_c 

If you would like a general overview and tutorial about using Wine, you can read the User Guide. For the most part, however, Wine should be as straightforward as clicking the application you&#39;d like to run from your Gnome/KDE/Whatever menu. 

When using the terminal there are two valid methods of running applications. The second method should ONLY be used if you are intending to install from something which has multiple CDs (you need to use this method to allow you to swap discs) as it doesn&#39;t always work. The First method is to chdir into the programs folder and then run the application directly, e.g. 

[code]cd &quot;~/.wine/drive_c/Games/Tron&quot; &amp;&amp; wine tron.exe 

The second method is to use the full Windows path like so... [/code]

[code]wine &quot;C:\Games\Tron\tron.exe&quot; 

Do NOT run with the full Linux path i.e. &quot;wine /stuff/mygame.exe&quot; or by double clicking icons from your window manager[/code]

(sometimes this works but more often it will fail with errors of some sort). 
If you use Gnome, KDE or XFCE4 then after you have installed some applications in Wine you should notice a Wine subfolder in your main desktop menu now which is just like the Windows &quot;Programs&quot; start bar menu which lists all your installed Wine programs (as long as you told them to make Start Menu shortcuts). If any apps seem to be missing try running &quot;wineboot&quot; and looking again.
