          <blockquote>
              <p>The squad joins the remainder of Ryan’s Airborne unit holding the bridge in Ramelle; situated in a strategic location, it is essential to either army in crossing the Merderet River. Miller tells Ryan about the deaths of his brothers, but Ryan refuses to leave his unit, even under Miller’s direct orders. Unable to complete their original mission as planned, Miller and Horvath decide that the squad will stay to defend the bridge from German attacks.</p>
<p>Soon after, Ramelle comes under attack by Waffen SS tanks and infantry who outnumber and outgun the Americans: a force consisting of at least 50 men accompanied by self-propelled guns and Tiger tanks. The Americans fight fiercely, but are slowly pushed back by the superior numbers and artillery. Private Jackson takes up a sniper’s post in a bell tower and shoots German soldiers until he is killed when the tower is destroyed by a shell from a German tank. Private Mellish holds a machine gun nest in the window of a house but his position is overrun by German soldiers after he runs out of ammunition. One of them kills him with a knife after a short but brutal hand-to-hand struggle. Upham, who was supposed to be resupplying Mellish, sits paralyzed with fear on the stairs as the German leaves the room and passes him without a word.</p>
<p>Miller retreats across the bridge with Reiben, Ryan, and a badly wounded Horvath, who collapses and dies soon after. They prepare to destroy the bridge, but a near miss from one of the German tanks knocks Miller off his feet and sends the detonator flying. He attempts to venture back onto the bridge into heavy enemy fire to retrieve it, but is shot (though not killed outright) by ‘Steamboat Willie’. Dazed and dying, Miller vainly fires his service pistol at the Tiger tank advancing across the bridge, when it impossibly explodes. Moments later, a pair of P-51 Mustangs fly over, having arrived as air support and bombed the tank. Upham emerges suddenly from his hiding spot and takes several remaining Germans prisoner, including ‘Steamboat Willie’, who tries to talk to Upham, but, having witnessed Miller’s shooting, Upham deliberately shoots him and tersely orders the others to leave.</p>
<p>Miller is tended to in vain by Reiben. His final words to Ryan are: “Earn this.” Ryan’s face morphs into that of an old man, standing near Miller’s grave at Colleville-sur-Mer, where the film opens. Before saluting the grave, an emotional Ryan expresses his hope that Miller will regard the life Ryan has tried to lead as a ‘good man’ as enough to repay the debt he owes Miller and his squad for their sacrifice.</p>
<p>Taken from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving_Private_Ryan" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a></p>
<p>Hope that helped.</p>
<p>Your friend,<br>
Leader</p>
