    <title>Connection/hosting problem...(SOMEONE WHO USES ROUTER TO HOST I NEED UR HELP)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connection-hosting-problem-someone-who-uses-router-to-host-i-need-ur-help/343872</link>
    <description>Ok before I start, I made like 2 more threads this week about this problem I&#39;ve been trying to solve and beileve me I tried almost everything so yeah I&#39;m sorry if I been annoying with all these threads but I really wish to get this solved this is the last time i&#39;m trying if I get no help I won&#39;t bother to try again.

So i&#39;m trying to host a server for my friends to join it and I have a weird problem, sometimes i&#39;m not able to connect, neither can my friends from their home (they use wireless router and so do i) and sometimes I can connect but they still can&#39;t, they can only connect if they use my router&#39;s internet when they&#39;re at my house and when they try to connect from their internet it just says error connecting to server and yes my server is on when they try to connect.

Now what I need to know from anyone who uses router to host how do you do it? or could I be doing something wrong? I&#39;ll show some pictures and see if you can find something wrong...

The ip in client, .Gui:

Port Forwarding:

[size=8pt]Yes, I did use the port checker it says both ports, 43594 and 5555 are open that means I portforwarded right.[/size]
FTP:

That&#39;s about everything and yes I did add the ports in the firewall exceptions

After all that still nothing I don&#39;t get it!! :S</description>

hm… Im not too familiar with cnet, but it sounds like everything should be working fine.<br>
Make sure the ip in the portforward box is the same as your default ip on your router.</p>
