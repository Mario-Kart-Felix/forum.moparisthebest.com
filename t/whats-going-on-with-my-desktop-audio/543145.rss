    <title>What&#39;s going on with my Desktop? - Audio</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whats-going-on-with-my-desktop-audio/543145</link>
    <description>So I have these normal earbuds I got at walmart. They work on my Laptop, they work on my IPhone, IPod, IPad and everything else, but my Desktop. When I put in my desktop everything sounds high-pitched. Almost like chimpmunks. Anyone ever had this before?  Do I need a different headset or is it something on my computer?</description>

<p>And if you have an old soundcard like me, what you can do is, “If the soundcard was made for win 98 and you have 7” is download the 98 drivers put them in a folder. then go to"Control panel&gt;administrative tools&gt;Device Manager"In vista its inside services like go it to services and the list should have “Device Manager” and when your in device manager go to “Sound, Video game controllers” and double click your sound browse my computer or specific folder and select the folder and wait then your done…</p>

              <p>Yes, I completely forgot about the EQ, my soundcard on my desktop is broken, first install all the latest drivers for your soundcard, check your sound settings, EQ, etc. If none of that fixes, get a new soundcard.</p>

              <p>install the audio driver again, you may also want to check your sound settings to make sure nothing was changed, also check if your media players equalizer has been changed to increase the sound as such.</p>
