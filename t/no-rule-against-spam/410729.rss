    <title>No rule against spam?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/no-rule-against-spam/410729</link>
    <description>One of the Ideals.

&lt;blockquote&gt;We do not care about post count alone. If someone has high post count but most of it is spam, we hate them. If someone has a high post count with informative posts, we love them. The higher count, the more we hate/love them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Rule 6:
We don&#39;t post misleading links, put appropriate warnings(while there&#39;s no specific rules on adult content, if you don&#39;t use Not Safe For Work(NSFW) warnings, you will be punished).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rule 9:
Do not post or upload any copyrighted material.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Can&#39;t help but see people getting in shit for spam? o.O 

Might as well make a rule against it....

<p>Not all people would know, this could be the first forum they ever joined. If it’s not on the rules, how will we prevent them from making mistakes?</p>
