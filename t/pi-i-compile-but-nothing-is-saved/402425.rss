          <blockquote>
              <p>Is there a compiling error. If so fix it. Make sure your opening the right launcher. Make sure your editing the right files. Make sure you restart the server after compiling it. Make sure it is set to the right version you have of jdk. To do that right click and click edit. It should say something like this somewhere in that code: <code>"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23\bin\javac.exe" </code> where it says jdk1.6.0_23 replace the numbers with the version you have. To see what version you have go to C:\Program Files\Java. If there isn’t a jdk folder there then you need to download jdk:<code>http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</code> the latest version is always on that official site. Make sure you have java and jdk to the newest update. One or more of these should help. Try them all until something helps.</p>
