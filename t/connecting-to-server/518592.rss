    <description>What&#39;s up?
I&#39;m having trouble connecting to my server. I&#39;ve done it right. canyouseeme says it can see service on port 43594. So I obviously portforwarded right. I&#39;m trying all I know, but I can&#39;t see to get it right. Would someone please help me?</description>

</aside>
<p>Those are two different things.<br>
No-ip address is the IP provided to you by the no-ip host.<br>
Localhost is connecting locally, commonly directed towards 127.0.0.1.<br>
On your personal client, assuming that you are the developer of the server and the server will be hosted from your IP, you must connect to localhost because you cannot connect to yourself through a server.<br>
On the client that you provide publicly, the connecting IP should be set to the IP you port forwarded with, which I assume in this case is your no-ip address.</p>
