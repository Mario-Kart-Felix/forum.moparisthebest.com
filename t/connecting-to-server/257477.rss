    <description>I tryed to register my server on the server status page. It said that it must be online to be reigistered our whatever.  It is running and i am online.

i went to my default gateway thing and made a new port forward.  The name was my server ip, the start port was 43594, the end port was 43594, and the host port was 43594.  then i saved it because there was no options left.

i also went to my firewall and created a new exception.

Name: rsps
Port: 43594
TCP


what else do i need to do or what did i do wrong?</description>
