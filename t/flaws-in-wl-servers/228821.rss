    <title>Flaws in wL servers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/flaws-in-wl-servers/228821</link>
    <description>Well, I know this stuff has been posted many times.  But nobody seems to be listening.  So Ive been doing some research on the wL server and here are some flaws I have come up with (once again, I know most if not all of this has been posted).  Also, with wL i am using the basic cheezscape 78 (as that is what almost all servers are based off of).  Sorry for any shitty coding conventions, I am just ripping the code i use for examples from my source (cheezscape) and writing some of it in my browser.  Oh, and if you find anything wrong with this, please tell me.

First I will start with wL:
Small Flaws:

[ul][li]Massive process usage.[/li]
[li]A fuck load of &quot;global objects&quot;[/li]
[li]Training on objects[/li]
[li]SendFrames[/li]
[li]Text file saving/loading[/li]
[li]Coding conventions[/li][/ul]


[u][b]Massive Process Usage[/b][/u]
This is a massive hell no.  Why does everyone on this site feel the need for all there shit to be called on ever half a second?  Adding all this code to boolean process or whatever you guys use is a very poor way of doing this.
[b]What you are doing:[/b]
[code]if (newAnimRequired &amp;&amp; newAnimDelay &lt; 1) {
	outStream.createFrame(1); // Xerozcheez: Resets animation so we can do another one yayyyy!
	startAnimation(newAnim);
	newAnimRequired = false;
}
if(Climbing &amp;&amp; ClimbStage == 1 &amp;&amp; actionTimer &lt; 1) { // Xerozcheez: Climbing up rocks part 1
	teleportToX = absX-1;
	teleportToY = absY;
	actionTimer = 5;
	ClimbStage = 2;
}[/code]

That is all being called every 500ms (half a second) in boolean process.  You are running 2 uneeded checks there (now that i look down further into the code there are many more xero added). 
[b]A better way to do this:[/b]
[code]public void updateAnim() {
	if (newAnimDelay &lt; 1) {
		outStream.createFrame(1); // Xerozcheez: Resets animation so we can do another one yayyyy!
		startAnimation(newAnim);
		newAnimRequired = false;
	}
}[/code]
There we have taken that check out of process, and added it into a method.  Then where ever you would normally put shit about [code]newAnimRequired == true;[/code] 
or some shit like that you would just put updateAnim();.  Basically what I am trying to say is only call on the check when absolutely necessary, not ever half a second.

[u][b]A fuck load of &quot;global objects&quot;:[/b][/u]
If I had a nickle for ever server that has this.  When are people gonna learn that adding all these shitty ass objects not only looks like shit, but also lags like hell.  What you are doing, is making it so every time a person enters an area with these objects, the client has to load even more objects then before.  When you create new object training zones you are adding what, 15-20+ &quot;global objects&quot;?  Every time a person goes into that area the client has to show 15-20+ extra objects, AND the server has to send 15-20+ more things to the client (making it even worse).  

[u][b]Training on objects:[/b][/u]
Thank god this is starting to disappear.  But it is a very bad practice for skills that don&#39;t need it (IE. Combat, fletching, etc.).  All this is, is a breeding ground for mass clicking.  A great alternative to this is npc training (which I can see a lot of servers are doing).  This isn&#39;t just object training though.  Anything that involves repetitive clicking is also a breeding ground for mass clicking.

[u][b]SendFrames:[/b][/u]
Fuck we need to get rid of as much of this as possible.  Sending frames (as in replacing text as you call it) is a very poor practice.  Especially when your changing the frames on something that is updating often and/or being used often (IE. Stats, the famous &quot;Server Consoles&quot;, etc.).  This is sending this text over and over again from the server to the client and back.  This causes major lag.

[u][b]Commands:[/b][/u]
The way you people do commands is horrible.  I am greatly appreciative of Meiscooldude&#39;s tutorial on this (i believe it&#39;s the one on using if/else shit).  The way you have it set up is that every time someone tries a command it checks EVERY command.
[b]What you are doing:[/b]
[code]	if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;fuck&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &lt;=2) {
		//do some shit
	} else if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;motherFucker&quot;)) {
		//do some shit
	} else if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;bigMotherFucker&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &lt;= 2) {
		//do some shit
}[/code]
[b]What you should be doing:[/b]
[code]	if (playerRights &gt;= 0) { // Commands normal players can use are here
	} else if (playerRights &gt;= 1) { // Commands mods can use goes here.
	} else if (playerRights &gt;= 2) { // Commands admins can use goes here.
}[/code]
and so on.  What that code I just gave you does, is check the player rights first.  So if there rights are 0, it only checks the commands in that if/else statement.  If there are mods (playerRight 1) it only checks the commands in that if/else statement and so on.  The only downside to this, is it takes up a little more space.  So what you might want to do is create a few more methods that stores the commands.

[u][b]Text File Saving/Loading:[/b][/u]
This is another very poor practice.  Loading from text files creates more lag, and is very insuficient.  A good way to load players, npcs, ect, SQL saving.  SQL is easy to set up, and allows a lot more things (IE. registering on your site, online highscores, a good message system, ect.).  Also, both are hackable.  Just because there on your computer DOES NOT mean nobody else can see them.  For instance, say you had a friend over to your house.  He was looking through your computer and found the char files.  He now has all there info.  With sql you can take a lot more security measures.  Like password protecting the database, encrypting the info (which can be done with both, but I find easier with sql).

[b][u]Coding Conventions[/u][/b]
wL&#39;s coding conventions suck.  Which do you think looks better?

[code]public void noConventions() {
if (yourMom == 1) {
sendMessage(&quot;HI&quot;);
} else {
sendMessage(&quot;YOUR MOM!&quot;);
}
}[/code]

Or

[code]public void correctConventions() {
    if (yourMom == 1) {
        sendMessage(&quot;HI&quot;);
    } else {
        sendMessage(&quot;YOUR MOM!&quot;);
    }
}[/code]

I, along with anyone on this site who knows a thing or two, should agree that the second one is much better to look at.  I encourage all of you learn the coding conventions.  There is a tool that will work this out for you, but I am not gona mention the name (using a tool isn&#39;t as much fun as learning is it?).  This isn&#39;t a major flaw really.  But using the coding conventions makes you look like you know a little more about java xD.

[u][b]Vital Flaws:[/b][/u]
There are a good bit of vital flaws in wL that need to be fixed.

[ul][li]1 Thread Per Client[/li]
[li]Massive switch statements[/li]
[li]How packets are handled[/li]
[li]Connections are never actually dropped[/li][/ul]


[u][b]1 Thread Per Client:[/b][/u]
This is probably one of the greatest flaws of wL.  It is the cause of your lag, and many crashes.  Basically the JVM can only hold so many threads before it fucks itself over.  Well, in wL every time a new player is made, a new thread is made.  Thats why we can only handle around 50 players at one time, and maybe 200 connections total.  What we need to be doing, is like in rs2dv, 1 thread holding all connections.  Until you people figure this out, you will keep getting &quot;SYIed&quot; and crashed.

[u][b]Massive switch statements:[/b][/u]
As some of you know, wL handles all players in a big fucking switch statement.  I don&#39;t feel like looking all through my server to find this, but that IS how players are handled.  It sucks, it&#39;s laggy and there are better ways to do this.  I will look for a better way to do this in the near future, but I currently don&#39;t have time xD.  This is not the only thing that is a massive switch statement.  Look in the next &quot;article&quot; thing.  Packets are also handled this way.

[u][b]How packets are handled:[/b][/u]
Packets are handled very poorly in wL.  All the major things are in 1 method like this.
[code]public void handlePackets(int packet) {
	//Shit to recieve the packets
	switch(packet) {
		case 45: // Just an example, lets say its action buttons
		case 1: // button id 1
		break;
		case 2: //button id 2
		break;
	}
}[/code]
and so on.

[b]What we should be doing:[/b]
[code]
public void actionButtonExample(int buttonID) {
	switch (buttonID) {
		case 1: //id 1
		break;
		case 2: //id 2
		break;
	}
}
public void handlePackets(int packet) {
	//Shit to recieve the packets
	switch(packet) {
		case 45:
		//Shit to get button id
		actionButtonExample(id);
		break;
	}
}[/code]

See the changes?  Doing that with all your shit will also get rid of the &quot;code to large&quot; error with parseIncoming packets.  As you add more things, you may need to add more methods to hold the action button clicks and the other shit.

[b][u]Connections are never actually dropped:[/u][/b]
Well first of all, thanks Yz for reminding me of this one.  This is a huge flaw that can not only keep your computer vaulnerable, but creates a lot of extra stress on the JVM.  Let&#39;s take a look at the logout button case:

[code]case 9154: //Log out
if (LogoutDelay &gt;= 0) {
	sendMessage(&quot;You have to wait 30 seconds out of being in combat to logout.&quot;);
} else {
	logout();
        savemoreinfo();
        saveStats();
}[/code]
If you notice the only things that are taking place (if the logout delay isnt greater then or equal to 0) is a logout method, saving more info, and saving the stats.  Let&#39;s take a look at the logout method.

[code]	public void logout(){
		outStream.createFrame(109);
	}
[/code]

If you look closely, you will see the only thing that happens, is a packet is sent to get the title screen.  But nothing actually gets rid of the player.  So what you have to do is close the socket basically, but I&#39;ll let you figure that out for yourselfs ;).

There are many more flaws that are in wL.  These are just a few I have found, and have found better ways of doing so.  As I find more, I will post them.  But the whole message of this post is, fck wL.  Get away from wL and everything that involves wL (including rs2e).  The only stable source out there is rs2dv that is stickied.  All the updated versions are shit ripped from wL and added to it.  I will leave you with one last question.  Do you care enough about your computer&#39;s and servers stability?  If so, get rid of wL.</description>

I’m 99% sure you know this, but I would like to add on that it depends on how you wright it.  If you write the code as</p>
<p><code>if (playerRights == 0) {
// commands
} else if (playerRights == 1) {
} else if (playerRights == 2) {
}</code></p>
<p>Then you will need to put the mod and normal player commands in the admin one also.  But if you write it as</p>
<p><code>if (playerRights &gt;= 0) {
//commdands
} else if (playerRights &gt;=1) {
}</code></p>
<p>then no.  You only need to put them once.</p>

No, because the command checks if the player’s rights are greater-than or equal-to. You wouldn’t need to copy the commands over because the lesser commands still apply to the greater rank.</p>
