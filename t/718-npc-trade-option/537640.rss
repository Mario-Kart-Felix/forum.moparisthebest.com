    <title>718 NPC trade option</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-npc-trade-option/537640</link>
    <description>Alright, I know this is kind of a noob request but I&#39;m stuck on it. How would you make an NPC offer 2 options, like a banker? You can click bank, and it opens the bank, or click talk-to and you can talk to him without the bank interface.


Say that I had an NPC that I wanted to have a conversation, and then display a list of teleports when you talked to him. I&#39;ve got that part down, made the .java for it, added it in Dialogue and added the:

Code:

[code]player.getDialogueManager().startDialogue(&#39;MYNPC&quot;, npc.getId(), 0);
[/code]
in NPCHandler.java... And it works fine, but how would I get him to open his shop if a player right clicked, and clicked trade? I want that to happen separately.

I tried doing it this way in NPCHandler.java:

Code:

[code]  if (npc.getId() == NPC) {
		                player.getDialogueManager().startDialogue(&quot;NPC&quot;, npc.getId(), 0);
                                ShopsHandler.openShop(player, 6);
}
[/code]

That code works fine, but it opens the shop and the dialogue at the same time. Any ideas? Sorry for the dumb question. I&#39;m probably overlooking something.</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>In NPCHandler.java look for:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Scroll down, and add your code under any <span class="bbcode-b">else if</span> statements, like this:</p>
<p>[code]else if (npc.getId() == 550)<br>
ShopsHandler.openShop(player, 14);</p>
<p>//Insert else if statement here<br>
else if (npc.getId() == NPC_ID_HERE)<br>
ShopsHandler.openShop(player, SHOP_ID_HERE);[/code]</p>
<p>What you were doing was adding both of the codes under <span class="bbcode-b">handleOption1</span> which will make it do both things at the same time. You will need to separate those 2 codes. One of them under <span class="bbcode-b">handleOption1</span>, and one of them under <span class="bbcode-b">handleOption2</span>.</p>
<p>Hope I helped you out! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
