    <title>317 Sprites Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-sprites-problem/427723</link>
    <description>Hello! I have attempted to get rid of the 317 Sprites that were on the client, by overwriting them with the original 317 Sprites. The issue is that the side icons are not in the right position. I have provided a picture to show what I mean, and have put a red rectangle over them. I really appreciate anyone who helps me, and I appreciate anyone who at least looks at this post. Thank You!
