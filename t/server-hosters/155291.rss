    <title>Server Hosters?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-hosters/155291</link>
    <description>I have been told many times that my server is just the best. But I get up to about 25 people and then I have to use my RAM optimizer over and over. I just want a Proffesional Hoster who can get my server up to 100 people 24/7 with NO lag.  Is there a URL where people advertise themselves? Can someone find me a Proffesional Hoster&#39;s URL? I&#39;ve serach all over google and I haven&#39;t found anything. Also, how would that work, I would be able to edit my server, and the hoster couldn&#39;t. Basically I just need a whole TUT on Hosters.

Thanks,
Play For Keeps</description>

              <p>if your server is good enough there are lots of people with good computers who would host it for free but like you said it is hard cuz you cant update or anything, and they sometimes steal your source</p>

              <p>well if you have a question about something i can probably help but the only way to have more RAM while hosting is to get more RAM, unless you already have over 1GB which then there is a problem because i can get over 130 people with no lag with 1GB and it only uses about 80% RAM</p>
