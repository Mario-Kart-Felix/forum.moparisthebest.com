Of course I would not fuck up again, I know I probably will not receive a second chance, all I am asking is for a reason why I do not deserve one as I was moderator for 6 months and moderated a lot, I even wrote a base for MSCP so people had something to work with.</p>
<p>But, I don’t still understand why my programming moderator position was removed, Cowie` left that position and the programming boards were unmoderated and I talked to Niall and he said I could have it. I didn’t even make a mistake when it came to moderating that board, but it was removed?</p>

I have demoted Yz85Racer to a regular member.  The only reason he is not banned is because he admitted it and I didn’t have to go through the database to see who did it.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this same action will take place if this ever happens again, hopefully it won’t.<br>

I seriously love how every other member would have gotten a warning, but since you don’t like me as it is. Funny, I could of sworn I had a part of the story to tell, but oh well. Lothy already issued me with a threatening of being demoted, and as far as I can recall, we agreed that I would be on probation.</p>
<p>Of course I admitted, I seriously had no shame in doing so. Tico135 doesn’t like me, even though he says he does. I don’t care if he doesn’t like me, but when he begins personally targeting my mentor, I am entitled to try and argue my case. I don’t mind being demoted, all I ask is that I am given a second chance. Silab was granted one, why am I any different?[/quote]</p>
<p>Where did you get the idea that I don’t like you?  I don’t like what you did, but it ends there.  About Silab, you are right, she was given a second chance, almost 2 years later…</p>

<p>I like you, Yz85racer, however I was not very fond of your action.  The reason frank_ was moderated was completely legit, and if you can not see that his post was clearly spam, you’re retarded (no offense).  I had not personally targeted frank_ until hours <span class="bbcode-i">after</span> the moderation had already been removed, so that is simply not an excuse.  I threatened frank_ with a ban a good 8-12 hours after I had originally moderated him.  I have nothing against you Yz, but I will not stand and watch when a certain moderator removes a punishment for a friend when they clearly went overboard.</p>

<p>Honestly a ban is taking it way too far. No need to lose a good member over that, we’re short of them as it is. It just seems stupid to ban someone for that, when you could spend that time banning an idiot such as pk4pk or runescape3dude.</p>
