    <title>Does anyone know why RSCD queues outgoing packages?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-anyone-know-why-rscd-queues-outgoing-packages/362546</link>
    <description>[code]
public class MiscPacketBuilder {
    /**
     * List of packets waiting to be sent to the user
     */
    private java.util.List&lt;RSCPacket&gt; packets = new java.util.ArrayList&lt;RSCPacket&gt;();
   /**
     * The player we are creating packets for
     */
    private Player player; 
    /**
     * Constructs a new MiscPacketBuilder
     */
    public MiscPacketBuilder(Player player) {
    	this.player = player;
    }

    /**
     * Clears old packets that have already been sent
     */
    public void clearPackets() {
    	packets.clear();
    }

    /**
     * Gets a List of new packets since the last update
     */
    public List&lt;RSCPacket&gt; getPackets() {
    	return packets;
    }
    *bunch of methods*
[/code]

All the methods look something like this:
[code]
/**
     * Hides the bank windows
     */
    public void hideBank() {
		RSCPacketBuilder s = new RSCPacketBuilder();
		s.setID(171);
		packets.add(s.toPacket());
    }

[/code]

My question is about the line &quot;packets.add(s.toPacket());&quot;. Why are outgoing packages queued? Why simply not use 
[code]
p.getSession().write(packet);
[/code]

The only explanation I see is that players will receive updates together, with a fixed delay (whenever the update loop runs), but I don&#39;t really see a reason for this.</description>

<p>CodeForFame, your argument with Davidi2 was because of a misunderstanding on his behalf, and you didn’t help matters either by assuming MINA didn’t queue the packets internally. Why would you want to continue your pointless argument?[/quote]</p>
<p>Classic was always about being available, especially to people with terrible connections, and computers; I originally played on a PII with 256MB or 512MB of RAM (I upgraded around the time that I started playing, I don’t remember if it was before or after), and had a dial-up connection.  I know for sure other people had worse computers…</p>
<p>Anyway, removing outdated packets would help both of those, and I don’t see why you would want to make the game unavailable to some people…</p>
<p>As for continuing with Davidi2, it’s purely because he refuses to admit he made a mistake, and thinks he’s right in every sense.  Also, I clarified and admitted to not knowing that MINA guaranteed ordering, but that still doesn’t make my initial statement wrong, like he’s trying to make it out to be.</p>

              <p>Again, I was referring to the stream sending to the client (<span class="bbcode-b">not</span> writing data into the buffer), and that’s what I was talking about the entire time. Also I’d like to point out you saying: [quote=“CodeForFame, post:31, topic:362546”]You’re now talking about writing to a stream that is using a protocol that guarantees delivery order…  The underlying protocol has absolutely nothing to do with if it is asynchronous or synchronous, and that is what ultimately guarantees delivery order.[/quote]Here you recognize what I am talking about, but you change the subject <span class="bbcode-i">back</span> to asycn vs synch IO, which I think we both agree does not determine order (as we’ve both said it multiple times)…</p>
<p>I still stand by what I said in regards to <span class="bbcode-b">sending</span> data, which is what you keep quoting.<br>
I also don’t understand why you keep only giving parts of my quotes, for example that first quote you say supports ordering is clearly saying that asynchronous IO does not modify the information at all, which means that while it doesn’t ‘disorder’ the data on purpose, it also doesn’t order it or do anything else.</p>
<p>At the third quote, I did not say “Sending something asynchronously doesn’t guarantee ordering…”, and you’re being a hypocrite by putting words into my mouth as well. If you read on (again you only included part of the quote), I continue to talk about the stream itself, which supports my point that I’m talking about after the data is written into stream, and is being sent to the client. You even recognize this (view the quote at the top of this post) but now you change your mind and say it has to do with asynch IO…?</p>
<p>When are you going to get over yourself and realize we are both right about the ordering of the data when talking about asynch vs synch, but I was just talking about something else when talking about writing to a stream (because again that’s what I interpreted your first post to be about)? This entire thing has been blown way out of proportion :rolleyes:</p>

<p>Note a lot of the time we WERE talking about different things, I was talking about once you’ve written to the stream, the things are sent to the client in the exact same order as you wrote them, which is why I said it guarantees order <span class="bbcode-i">just like normal IO</span> (hence why I even mentioned the flip method). I assumed you were saying that things are sometimes sent to the client in a different order than they were in the buffer when the send method was called (to be honest I still don’t know what you were/are talking about, because you change the discussion so much…) because yes, that is <span class="bbcode-b">completely</span> wrong unless you are sending datagram packets. If you care to explain what you WERE talking about, perhaps we can have a civilized discussion. I don’t know why you insist on calling me a moron or idiot because we obviously have a failure of communication and interpretation, but I’ll try not to do the same.</p>
<p>As for the contradictory statements, they all say the same thing except the middle one, which I explained in the paragraph above.</p>
<p>Enjoy.[/quote]</p>
<p>You’ve been the one attempting to change the discussion completely, because you’re talking out of your ass, and pretending I’m saying things I’m clearly not.</p>
<p>No, a lot of the time <span class="bbcode-b">you</span> were talking about different things, I continually corralled to back to the actual point.</p>
<p>Okay, let’ pretend you were talking about once you’ve written to the stream.  You’ve no moved away from what asynchronous IO is, and to the protocol being used.  And in that case you’re still wrong, because not every protocol guarantees order.  Also, blocking IO makes no guarantees as to the ordering…</p>
<p>I’ve never said that, except when talking about protocols that don’t guarantee ordering…  I’ve already explain what I originally said, go back and read.  Now, even <span class="bbcode-b">if</span> I did say that sending things asynchronously doesn’t guarantee ordering I would be correct; thus your initial theory that I didn’t know what asynchronous meant would still have no basis.</p>
<p>You’re assuming that the transport-layer protocol guarantees delivery order, asynchonous IO says absolutely nothing about the protocol that needs to be used…  You’re just make irrelevant, and retarded assumptions to make it seem like you’re correct, when you’re fundamentally wrong.  Also, there are more transport-layer protocols that don’t have guaranteed delivery order than ones that do.</p>
<p>If you care to actually read what I’ve said you’d notice I’ve already explained it.</p>
<p>You’re the idiot because you’re consistently changing your position, and failing to understand what is being said.</p>
<p>No, they switch pretty much every time…</p>
<p>This one is implying that it guarantees ordering.</p>

<p>As you can see when I explicitly point it out, you’ve said it guarantees ordering twice, and has nothing to do with ordering three times.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I’ve said in all seven posts (regarding this specifically) that it has nothing to do with order.  Not once did I contradict myself; though I’ll admit the first post wasn’t very clear, but I made it abundantly clear after that.</p>

<p>Note a lot of the time we WERE talking about different things, I was talking about once you’ve written to the stream, the things are sent to the client in the exact same order as you wrote them, which is why I said it guarantees order <span class="bbcode-i">just like normal IO</span> (hence why I even mentioned the flip method). I assumed you were saying that things are sometimes sent to the client in a different order than they were in the buffer when the send method was called (to be honest I still don’t know what you were/are talking about, because you change the discussion so much…) because yes, that is <span class="bbcode-b">completely</span> wrong unless you are sending datagram packets. If you care to explain what you WERE talking about, perhaps we can have a civilized discussion. I don’t know why you insist on calling me a moron or idiot because we obviously have a failure of communication and interpretation, but I’ll try not to do the same.</p>
<p>As for the contradictory statements, they all say the same thing except the middle one, which I explained in the paragraph above.</p>

</aside>
<p>Wow, you really are stupid…  I’ve never claimed that doing something asynchronously has anything to do with order, in fact I’ve stated the opposite throughout this entire discussion (asynchronous IO guarantees nothing in regards to ordering, and if you want that guarantee, you need make it yourself, or use a library that does it for you (along with a protocol that guarantees ordering)).  On the other hand, you have explicitly stated that it <span class="bbcode-b">does</span> guarantee ordering, but now you’re switching sides <span class="bbcode-b">again</span>…</p>
<p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:30, topic:362546”]No, it <span class="bbcode-b">does</span> guarantee ordering, just like normal IO. It’s a stream (or channel) that things are written to, and they are sent in a specific order and received in the same order. If this was not true then all IO would be very pointless (imagine mixing up the bytes for a split up int, your integer would be completely off)</p>
<p>If you write to a stream in one order, it’s going to send them in that order (or backwards if you use flip() on the buffer)</p>
<p>This is what I was talking about, (and the people that called you ‘a moron’) when I said look up the meaning of asynch IO.[/quote]<br>
Anyway, you’ve been arguing this whole time against things I’ve never even come close to saying, because you clearly don’t know how to read/comprehend English.  You’ve also contradicted yourself about the very core of the discussion…</p>
<p>Continually correcting your misunderstandings is ridiculous, because you’re so dense, and don’t even understand what’s being said…  Simply put, you’re a complete and utter idiot; you need to figure out what we’re even talking about, go over both of our posts, and then reply.  Seeing you have such major issues, I suggest you read it out loud, because it seems to help morons like yourself.</p>
<p>I’ll just end this with a handful of your contradictory statements…</p>

<p>Anyway, as long as you understand something that is asynchronous doesn’t inherently make ordering guaranteed we can stop.  If not, just say so, and I’ll continue right where we left off.</p>

              <p>I think both of you know what you are talking about, but are talking about different things.  CodeForFame is correct in saying that since the calls don’t block (are asynchronous), if multiple threads are sending packets, you can’t really guarantee which gets sent first.  Davidi2 is correct in saying that the word asynchronous doesn’t mean that things are sent out of order.</p>
<p>[quote=“Not_a_bot, post:24, topic:362546”]It’s using an ArrayList because it has to access any element in the list when sending the packets…it does NOT utilize FIFO. If you were to use LinkedList, you would get thrown exceptions left and right (ConcurrentModification to be exact) since it would not be synchronized with the thread sending them.</p>
<p>[quote=API]<br>
This exception may be thrown by methods that have detected concurrent modification of an object when such modification is not permissible.<br>
[/quote][/quote]</p>
<p>None of what you said makes any sense at all.  ArrayList is not synchronized and can throw a concurrent modification exception as well, if it really needs to be synchronized it should be declared like this:</p>
<p>List list = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList(…));<br>
(as stated here: <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html">http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html</a>)</p>
<p>And if it’s not obvious enough, that could just as easily be anything that implements the List interface, even:</p>
<p>List list = Collections.synchronizedList(new LinkedList(…));</p>

<p><em>sigh</em></p>
<p>TCP guarantees ordering, MINA guarantees ordering, but asynchronous anything does not have anything to do with ordering.</p>
<p>If you’re using the UDP asynchronously then you can receive packets out of order.  This shows that because something is asynchronous, it doesn’t not guarantee the order ‘sent’ is the order received.  Also, if you look closely, you’ll recognize that when using TCP you don’t have to worry about the protocol level out-of-ordering, but you do need to worry about out-of-ordering at the point of writing to the socket on the OS level; there are tons of libraries that abstract this away, including the Java API, and MINA (much further than the Java API).</p>
<p>You’re now talking about writing to a stream that is using a protocol that guarantees delivery order…  The underlying protocol has absolutely nothing to do with if it is asynchronous or synchronous, and that is what ultimately guarantees delivery order.</p>
<p>You and the other people who called me a ‘moron’ are obviously oblivious to what asynchronous means, and protocols that don’t guarantee delivery order…  You should really come out of the ‘RSPS’ bubble, and learn something useful.</p>

<p>[quote=“Not_a_bot, post:24, topic:362546”]It’s using an ArrayList because it has to access any element in the list when sending the packets…it does NOT utilize FIFO. If you were to use LinkedList, you would get thrown exceptions left and right (ConcurrentModification to be exact) since it would not be synchronized with the thread sending them.</p>
<aside class="quote">
<div class="title">

 API:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>This exception may be thrown by methods that have detected concurrent modification of an object when such modification is not permissible.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The method I posted is found in the RSCConnectionHandler class, from what it looks like it’s processed before being sent to the main queue …</p>
<p>Taken from the RSCA source.</p>
<p>[code]public void messageReceived(IoSession session, Object message) {<br>
Player player = (Player) session.getAttachment();<br>
if (session.isClosing() || player.destroyed()) {<br>
return;<br>
}<br>
RSCPacket p = (RSCPacket) message;</p>
<pre><code>/* if(p.getID() == 57 || p.getID() == 73 || p.getID() == 40 || p.getID()
 == 51 || p.getID() == 128 || p.getID() == 206 || p.getID() == 71 ||
 p.getID() == 55)*/

if(p.getID() == 55)
    player.addInterval();

player.addPacket(p);
packets.add(p); 
}[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>[code]</p>
<p>public void addPacket(RSCPacket p) {<br>
long now = System.currentTimeMillis();<br>
if (now - lastCount &gt; 3000) {<br>
lastCount = now;<br>
packetCount = 0;<br>
}<br>
if (!DataConversions.inArray(Formulae.safePacketIDs, p.getID())<br>
&amp;&amp; packetCount++ &gt;= 60) {<br>
destroy(false);<br>
}<br>
if (lastPackets.size() &gt;= 60) {<br>
lastPackets.remove();<br>
}<br>
lastPackets.addLast§;<br>
}[/code][/quote]</p>
<p>In the version I have, lastPackets is a LinkedList, and isn’t used for anything but ‘bot detection’…</p>
<p>Anyway, you should be looking at the PacketQueue class for incoming packets.  It uses an ArrayList there, and has access synchronized.</p>
