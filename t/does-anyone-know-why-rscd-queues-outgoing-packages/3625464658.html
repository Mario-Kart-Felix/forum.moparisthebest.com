</aside>
<p>You’re getting caught up in the naming of the class, and looking at every method each class has…  In this case all you need is the collection to be in FIFO order, be able to get entries stored in the collection, insert, and remove entries.  An ArrayList and FIFO queue meet these requirements.</p>
<p>How do you figure?  Give specific reasons why a queue would be better in this specific case.</p>

<p>If it doesn’t use FIFO, then the order in which packets are sent wouldn’t matter.  You could run into issues like a player switching items twice in an update cycle, then the update packets being flipped.  Now the player is displaying the wrong items.</p>
<p>I’m not certain about the ConcurrentModification exception being thrown idea…  I’d need to see the implementation of the write method, or the exception actually being thrown.</p>

I do not believe anyone said which was more beneficial, we were just giving options. But you of course, on your high horse, immediately took it upon yourself to demean anyone that said anything contrary to what you believe without even considering if what you interpret as what they say is correct. Not to mention you say something completely incorrect while doing it…<br>

<p>Furthermore, what exactly did I say that was incorrect?[/quote]I was talking about how you explained Asynchronous IO. It does not at all modify, ‘jumble’, mutate, disorder, or whatever else you were saying to the data (including MINA), all it means is that you can read and write while still performing other tasks without creating new threads for each IO stream. You usually pair blocking and non blocking IO together, usually you have your selector block (Selector.select() instead of Selector.selectNow()) while it waits for new data and then each channel is non-blocking.</p>

<p>You’ve got to be kidding me…  You’re the one that said I was wrong, when you were completely wrong; using a queue in this situation isn’t ‘great’.  Using a queue in this situation has no benefits (that I can think of), and you acted as if they were better than using an ArrayList, even though I didn’t even say it was better at that point.</p>

[/quote]I was talking about how you explained Asynchronous IO. It does not at all modify, ‘jumble’, mutate, disorder, or whatever else you were saying to the data (including MINA), all it means is that you can read and write while still performing other tasks without creating new threads for each IO stream. You usually pair blocking and non blocking IO together, usually you have your selector block (Selector.select() instead of Selector.selectNow()) while it waits for new data and then each channel is non-blocking.[/quote]</p>
<p>I never even came remotely close to saying it modified, jumbled, or mutated anything.  I simply said that sending things asynchronously doesn’t guarantee the order in which packets are sent…  Now, MINA does guarantee ordering, but it took me a bit of searching to find that out…  Apparently, MINA also guarantees that a once a connection is established, only one thread will process the queue for a client.</p>
<p>[quote=“Not_a_bot, post:24, topic:362546”]It’s using an ArrayList because it has to access any element in the list when sending the packets…it does NOT utilize FIFO. If you were to use LinkedList, you would get thrown exceptions left and right (ConcurrentModification to be exact) since it would not be synchronized with the thread sending them.</p>

<p>The method I posted is found in the RSCConnectionHandler class, from what it looks like it’s processed before being sent to the main queue …</p>
<p>Taken from the RSCA source.</p>
<p>[code]public void messageReceived(IoSession session, Object message) {<br>
Player player = (Player) session.getAttachment();<br>

lastPackets.addLast§;<br>

<p>In the version I have, lastPackets is a LinkedList, and isn’t used for anything but ‘bot detection’…</p>
<p>Anyway, you should be looking at the PacketQueue class for incoming packets.  It uses an ArrayList there, and has access synchronized.</p>

<p><em>sigh</em></p>
<p>TCP guarantees ordering, MINA guarantees ordering, but asynchronous anything does not have anything to do with ordering.</p>
<p>If you’re using the UDP asynchronously then you can receive packets out of order.  This shows that because something is asynchronous, it doesn’t not guarantee the order ‘sent’ is the order received.  Also, if you look closely, you’ll recognize that when using TCP you don’t have to worry about the protocol level out-of-ordering, but you do need to worry about out-of-ordering at the point of writing to the socket on the OS level; there are tons of libraries that abstract this away, including the Java API, and MINA (much further than the Java API).</p>
<p>You’re now talking about writing to a stream that is using a protocol that guarantees delivery order…  The underlying protocol has absolutely nothing to do with if it is asynchronous or synchronous, and that is what ultimately guarantees delivery order.</p>
<p>You and the other people who called me a ‘moron’ are obviously oblivious to what asynchronous means, and protocols that don’t guarantee delivery order…  You should really come out of the ‘RSPS’ bubble, and learn something useful.</p>

        <p>I’m pretty sure we were talking about TCP here, because nobody mentioned UDP as it’s an entirely different protocol that yes, can send things in a different order.

<p>Whereas you on the other hand are saying:</p>
<p>[quote=“CodeForFame, post:16, topic:362546”]The order in which they’re sent doesn’t matter, nor does it impact anything, because they’re being sent asynchronously (and the order can be mixed up anyway)…[/quote]Which would <span class="bbcode-b">only</span> be correct if we were using UDP (in which case being sent asynchronously would STILL have nothing to do with the order…).</p>

        <p>I think both of you know what you are talking about, but are talking about different things.  CodeForFame is correct in saying that since the calls don’t block (are asynchronous), if multiple threads are sending packets, you can’t really guarantee which gets sent first.  Davidi2 is correct in saying that the word asynchronous doesn’t mean that things are sent out of order.</p>
<p>[quote=“Not_a_bot, post:24, topic:362546”]It’s using an ArrayList because it has to access any element in the list when sending the packets…it does NOT utilize FIFO. If you were to use LinkedList, you would get thrown exceptions left and right (ConcurrentModification to be exact) since it would not be synchronized with the thread sending them.</p>
<p>[quote=API]<br>
This exception may be thrown by methods that have detected concurrent modification of an object when such modification is not permissible.<br>
[/quote][/quote]</p>
<p>None of what you said makes any sense at all.  ArrayList is not synchronized and can throw a concurrent modification exception as well, if it really needs to be synchronized it should be declared like this:</p>
<p>List list = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList(…));<br>
(as stated here: <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html">http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html</a>)</p>
<p>And if it’s not obvious enough, that could just as easily be anything that implements the List interface, even:</p>
<p>List list = Collections.synchronizedList(new LinkedList(…));</p>

<p>I never have ‘hard feelings’.</p>
<p>Anyway, as long as you understand something that is asynchronous doesn’t inherently make ordering guaranteed we can stop.  If not, just say so, and I’ll continue right where we left off.</p>

<p>Wow, you really are stupid…  I’ve never claimed that doing something asynchronously has anything to do with order, in fact I’ve stated the opposite throughout this entire discussion (asynchronous IO guarantees nothing in regards to ordering, and if you want that guarantee, you need make it yourself, or use a library that does it for you (along with a protocol that guarantees ordering)).  On the other hand, you have explicitly stated that it <span class="bbcode-b">does</span> guarantee ordering, but now you’re switching sides <span class="bbcode-b">again</span>…</p>
<p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:30, topic:362546”]No, it <span class="bbcode-b">does</span> guarantee ordering, just like normal IO. It’s a stream (or channel) that things are written to, and they are sent in a specific order and received in the same order. If this was not true then all IO would be very pointless (imagine mixing up the bytes for a split up int, your integer would be completely off)</p>
<p>If you write to a stream in one order, it’s going to send them in that order (or backwards if you use flip() on the buffer)</p>
<p>This is what I was talking about, (and the people that called you ‘a moron’) when I said look up the meaning of asynch IO.[/quote]<br>
Anyway, you’ve been arguing this whole time against things I’ve never even come close to saying, because you clearly don’t know how to read/comprehend English.  You’ve also contradicted yourself about the very core of the discussion…</p>
<p>Continually correcting your misunderstandings is ridiculous, because you’re so dense, and don’t even understand what’s being said…  Simply put, you’re a complete and utter idiot; you need to figure out what we’re even talking about, go over both of our posts, and then reply.  Seeing you have such major issues, I suggest you read it out loud, because it seems to help morons like yourself.</p>
<p>I’ll just end this with a handful of your contradictory statements…</p>

        <blockquote>Continually correcting your misunderstandings is ridiculous, because you're so dense, and don't even understand what's being said... </blockquote> It's funny because I've said almost this exactly thing about you because this discussion has jumped around so much... :P
<p>Note a lot of the time we WERE talking about different things, I was talking about once you’ve written to the stream, the things are sent to the client in the exact same order as you wrote them, which is why I said it guarantees order <span class="bbcode-i">just like normal IO</span> (hence why I even mentioned the flip method). I assumed you were saying that things are sometimes sent to the client in a different order than they were in the buffer when the send method was called (to be honest I still don’t know what you were/are talking about, because you change the discussion so much…) because yes, that is <span class="bbcode-b">completely</span> wrong unless you are sending datagram packets. If you care to explain what you WERE talking about, perhaps we can have a civilized discussion. I don’t know why you insist on calling me a moron or idiot because we obviously have a failure of communication and interpretation, but I’ll try not to do the same.</p>
<p>As for the contradictory statements, they all say the same thing except the middle one, which I explained in the paragraph above.</p>
