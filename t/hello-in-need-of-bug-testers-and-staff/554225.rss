    <title>Hello, in need of bug testers and staff</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hello-in-need-of-bug-testers-and-staff/554225</link>
    <description>I am in need of 3-4 bug testers for a server that will go live in a few weeks.  In short, those chosen to help bug test will play the server, help to determine, and/or weed out any bugs.  As time to launch approaches, a select few will receive a staff rank based only on dedication and determination to make a well-rounded atmosphere for our community.  Feel free to pm me, post below, or add my skype which is suseto1989, for more information on my projected date of release and basic requirements from you the bug tester.

Edit:  Still in need of a moderator recently released pm me on Skype for details.</description>
