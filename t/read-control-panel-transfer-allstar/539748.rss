              <p>You would need to rip it out, a good starting point would be your main class, as itâ€™s almost indefinitely created there. Then just run through your code copying code over. Or you can try using <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,606050.msg4226794.html#msg4226794" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> tutorial, it might be for a different revision but the basic idea is the same. You create a frame and have it access your server, on its own thread, manipulating it as you see fit. You should look at <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> tutorial, it looks at using swing components.</p>
