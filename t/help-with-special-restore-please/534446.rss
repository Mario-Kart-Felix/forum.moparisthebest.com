    <description>So like i seen this codes where i can change the time seconds to how long it takes to get back 100spec restored back.And I seen a code that talked about a ring and saw on the very right &quot;Ring of Vigour&quot;.It works with the ring of vigour for the time seconds for how long it restores back to 100 spec.I thought since it said &quot;Ring&quot; and on the right it said &quot;ring of vigour&quot; i thought that if you change the ring of vigour&#39;s name to a different type of ring.It&#39;ll work for that ring.Might sound stupid to think that,but i gave it a shot.And it didnt work :P.I was wondering how i can change it? I want it to work for my perfect ring :D It looks like this :)

Where it says &quot;perfect ring&quot; it was actually ring of vigour,just thought it would work if i changed the name and i was wrong  :rolleyes: HELP PLZ!THX!  :D

[code]       public static final int INCREASE_SPECIAL_AMOUNT = 10000; // how fast your special bar refills
	public static final int INCREASE_SPECIAL_AMOUNT_WITH_RING = 1000 ; // how fast your special bar refills with &#39;perfect&#39;_ring
                public static final boolean PRAYER_POINTS_REQUIRED = true; // you need prayer points to use prayer
	public static final boolean PRAYER_LEVEL_REQUIRED = true; // need prayer level to use different prayers
	public static final boolean MAGIC_LEVEL_REQUIRED = true; // need magic level to cast spell
	public static final int GOD_SPELL_CHARGE = 300000; // how long does god spell charge last?
	public static final boolean RUNES_REQUIRED = true; // magic rune required?
	public static final boolean CORRECT_ARROWS = true; // correct arrows for bows?
	public static final boolean CRYSTAL_BOW_DEGRADES = false; // magic rune required?   [/code]</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>In my server the ring of vigour is ID: 19669<br>
So search the ID (or your vigour’s ID) and it should come up in a file like CombatAssistant. There’s a specific method that handles special restore but I can’t remember the name. Anyways, after you find the method it will have something like if(Config.INCREASE_SPECIAL_AMOUNT_WITH_RING) { and some code after that, what you want to do is change the ID that’s in there, which is your vigour.</p>
