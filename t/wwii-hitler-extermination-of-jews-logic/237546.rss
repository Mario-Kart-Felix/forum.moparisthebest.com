    <title>WWII. Hitler. Extermination of Jews. Logic?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wwii-hitler-extermination-of-jews-logic/237546</link>
    <description>I came up with the idea to write this when Jorg Haider died. Haider was an important politician in Austria. He was one of the few politicians to admit that they admired Hitler. After admitting this, every politician in Europe was shocked. It was unheard of, Hitler did nothing but bad things. But if you take a better look at the events that took place before Hitler became Reichs Kanselier, you&#39;ll see that it was all pure logic.

Why did Hitler get so much power?
The main cause can be found in 1919. The year of the Treaty of Versailles. Hitler reffered to this treaty as &#39;The dictate of Versailles&#39;, and it was. Germany had lost the war, and had to pay for the damage caused by them. Germany was not allowed to be present when the other country&#39;s negotiated about the treaty. Germany only had to sign it, and then stick to it. It was hard for Germany, but during the years the amount of goldmarks Germany had to pay was lowered. 

But then came 1929. The Great Depression. The whole world suffered, including Germany. Germany still had to pay, but obviously they couldn&#39;t. Mass inflation in Germany made it even worse. This fueled the German anger against the rest of the world. Every German was poor, except the Jews. Generally the Jews were wealthy. This united the rest of Germany.

Uniting Germany? This was very important. This was one of the causes of the French German war. Before that war, Germany was a compilation of states. The northern states were united, but Bayern, Baden and Wurttemberg didn&#39;t care about one Germany. So the Kanselier of Prussia, Otto von Bismarck, decided that in order to unite Germany, they needed a common enemy. This enemy was France, obviously. Germany defeated France, and a united Germany was a fact.

But back to WWII. The Germans once again needed a common enemy. Hitler gave them one: the Jews. Quickly after Hitler got his power the Jews were imprisoned and after that they got exterminated. Hitler fueled the economy by expanding the German military. The Germans were exited, happy that their country was important again. Everyone wanted to join the army, and those who were more enthousiastic joined the elite like the SS.

It&#39;s quite common that in a country where a minority is wealthier then the majority, an extirmination of the minority takes place. Take a look at the Hutu&#39;s and the Tutsi&#39;s.

What I&#39;m trying to say here, is that it was cooincidence that the Jews were the common enemy. The Jews were unlucky, but it could have been Catholics or Atheists or any minority. As long as that minority was wealthier then the majority. This can only happen when the majority is really poor, and the minority differs much from the majority. So don&#39;t expect that the Belgian people will attack the bankers, because they are all the same.</description>

<p>Germany wasn’t on the edge, the reason Germany capitulated was that there was a revolution. The result was the Republic of Weimar. It’s quite similar to the Russian revolution, after which the Russians pulled back. The new socialist government of Germany decided that the war costed too much, so they decided to pull the plug.</p>

<p>Having the anonymity there has the downsides as well. First off, we can’t see if the source is reliable. Second, if we have anonymity then people will soon come to rely on it.</p>
<p>Ideally, we should be wanting enough people to present the other side of things and be able to stand up without them requiring anonymity. This will never happen though.</p>

<p>It’s common for education organisations to tell their students that looking at history allows us to see what could happen in the future and how to avoid any problems that may arise. However, they contradict themselves by being bias to the bone and leaving out large parts.</p>
<p>It’s a shame really.</p>

<p>Many of the Nazi’s 25 points i do agree with. In <span class="bbcode-i">Mein Kampf</span> it frequently mentions that peace is a corrupting force and war is the way to progression. Upon closer inspection, it’s rather amazing as to how accurate these two statements are.</p>
<p>To be honest, the Treaty of Versailles was just asking for the German’s to oppose them. It’s rather sad that anyone who does agree with Nazi ideology is looked down upon is modern society.</p>

<p>From what i can remember from studying history, Hitler cut off handing the unemployed money. From an economic view, this was excellent. For the individuals, it was rather horrible to be forced into jobs with such bad conditions. The NAZI party first set out to represent both the lower and middle class, which later got a bit blurred.</p>
<blockquote>Without Hitler, Germany was doomed. Germany had one chance to regain there respect, there power and there money. Germany owed everyone money, had no money to give, and was spat upon by every other country. So, logical plan of action? Stop being a bitch and Fight back.</blockquote>
<p>I’m not going to argue against the good that Hitler had done for Germany. This is something i strongly agree with. However, i just thought that i would point out that German propaganda played a huge role is giving the German people the impression that their conditions were fine and that Germany was doing better than it actually was for the average citizen.</p>
<p>The Nazi party were apparently strong believers of <span class="bbcode-i">‘Strength Through Joy’</span> which basically told the German people that they gain their power and strength through their holidays (which they implied that the Nazi party provided. The truth was a bit different. The German people had very little time and money to go on holidays. This is a fine example of German manipulation of the people.</p>
<p>However, what most of us believe has been deeply impacted by the Allies use of propganda and ability to leave out certain facts. I acknowledge this as well.</p>
