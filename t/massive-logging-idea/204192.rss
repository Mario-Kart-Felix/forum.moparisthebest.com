    <title>Massive Logging Idea</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/massive-logging-idea/204192</link>
    <description>I recently had an idea of possibly logging every single int, boolean, array, string, and whatnot of the client. It would take some time, don&#39;t get me wrong, but it&#39;d be a very neat debugging tool no doubt.

The question is: would it fuck the client&#39;s computer over? Well, I tried to debug a 4D-array the other day (the boolean array array array array that handles whether a tile be displayed or not) which took approximately three hours... but I still am up to putting time into logging everything. Unless someone has already done this?</description>

              <p>I’ve tried something similar before, but there’s far too much information presented to make any real sense of it unless you invest an extraordinary amount of time. I spent a day on static integers alone and all I could come up with is the static int that stores weight, a static int that increments if a projectile comes at you, and a few other relatively useless values. Strings might be more useful, but again, it’s just far too much information to sift through especially without any real context. Not only that, but there are many useless method counters, etc that would make it all the more difficult.</p>
<p>EDIT: Presumably, you could attach an omniscient debugger and find values that way, but I haven’t tried that method.</p>

Writing the difference is a better idea. Hook calls to that set the array and its elements (that will get a bit more complex - but still possible) and then just write that. Alternatively you could pause all the threads in the client, and create a copy of the array. Then unpause, pause, write the difference, rinse and repeat.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Probably still take just as long though[/quote]<br>
Are you talking about the first or second method?</p>
