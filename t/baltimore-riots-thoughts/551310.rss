    <title>Baltimore Riots - Thoughts?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/baltimore-riots-thoughts/551310</link>
    <description>Ready. Set. Go. Thoughts? Seeing as though it&#39;s flooding every news station in the United States (Not sure about anywhere else,) I&#39;m curious as to how other people stand on the situation? Casual talk around these parts are split. Yeah, police brutality was, of course, a factor, but people always want to talk about how much of an upstanding gentlemen the victim was, who had a hefty arrest record at age 19, similar to Mike Brown, that being said, he didn&#39;t deserve to die. Then there are the rioters destroying their own town and homes, for what? CNN Newsroom released the 2014 statistics of people killed by police nationwide, and the amount of African Americans in opposition to Caucasian victims was not even close (414 Caucasian victims, 233 African Americans.) These situation always intrigue me, and so I&#39;m curious as to what people who actually diagnose the situation intellectually think? Is race even an issue? How would the script flip if the roles were switched? Thoughts about the city of Baltimore&#39;s reaction? Social media exaggerates, obviously, and caters to extremities, not many people see whats going on behind the scenes and so we judge accordingly. 

Then there are individual knuckleheads like this.

and people like this

But, as I aforementioned, media exaggerates. Just curious as to what you all think.</description>

              <p>Ready. Set. Go. Thoughts? Seeing as though it’s flooding every news station in the United States (Not sure about anywhere else,) I’m curious as to how other people stand on the situation? Casual talk around these parts are split. Yeah, police brutality was, of course, a factor, but people always want to talk about how much of an upstanding gentlemen the victim was, who had a hefty arrest record at age 19, similar to Mike Brown, that being said, he didn’t deserve to die. Then there are the rioters destroying their own town and homes, for what? CNN Newsroom released the 2014 statistics of people killed by police nationwide, and the amount of African Americans in opposition to Caucasian victims was not even close (414 Caucasian victims, 233 African Americans.) These situation always intrigue me, and so I’m curious as to what people who actually diagnose the situation intellectually think? Is race even an issue? How would the script flip if the roles were switched? Thoughts about the city of Baltimore’s reaction? Social media exaggerates, obviously, and caters to extremities, not many people see whats going on behind the scenes and so we judge accordingly.</p>
<p>Then there are individual knuckleheads like this.<br>

<p>and people like this<br>

<p>But, as I aforementioned, media exaggerates. Just curious as to what you all think.</p>
