    <description>i have azureus...i was trying to download a file the size of 2.84 MB from demonoid.com but i was downloading so slow i couldnt believe it. during the setup i sort of rushed through it all beacuse i hardly understood a thing like ports and stuff.(im new to torrents). yeah so it was downloading very slow and the speed was 500 and something B/s (average). down the bottom the ratio button was red. next to that firewalled was red. next to that DHT firewalled was yellowish. i have broadband with optus, and i use a wireless router. can someone help me speed it up becuase when downloading other stuff it was way way quicker.  :confused: and also i have NOD32 anti virus maybe thats got something to do with it?
