    <description>ok so didn know what quite to call what im trying to do but here it goes

so each playerfile has a variable, well i added a custom one, and what i want to happen is when i use ::update, it changes said varable to 1,  for all players online and offline before it restarts the server, how would i go about doing that?

aswell as how can i make the server automaticly do ::update every 24 hours?</description>

<p>Yes, hence why you’d first modify the online accounts, taking note of their names, then modify the offline accounts, and if the filename is one of the online accounts, you’d skip it</p>

<p>and if the filename is one of the online accounts, you’d skip it&lt;<br>
Oh, I mis-interpretated that. So you list the names of players being online, modify them from that point on, then loop through the account files, check if any of the account names equal a name in the list, skip it, else modify it too.</p>
<p>I’d use a Set for this procedure, due to it not allowing duplicate elements.<br>
[/quote]<br>
No need for that. ArrayList would work just fine. How would you even get a duplicate? It’s not like 2 players are going to have the same username.<br>
Plus, you’re just checking the list if it contains it.</p>
<p><code>ArrayList&lt;String&gt; playersModified = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
for(Player p : PlayerHandler.players) {
     if(p != null) {
          p.setValue(1);
          playersModified.add(p.playerName);
     }
}
File[] dir = new File("./characters/").listFiles();
for(File f : dir) {
     if(f != null &amp;&amp; !playersModified.contains(f.getName().substring(0, f.getName().indexOf('.'))) {
          // parse the file and set the value and save here.
     }
}</code>[/quote]<br>
… I’m not discussing this out anymore, this gets too stupid anyways.</p>

              <p>Java has a couple different file reader and file writer type api’s you can use them to access and edit the character file since its in a predictable location and since the files follow a predictable format.</p>

              <p>ok so didn know what quite to call what im trying to do but here it goes</p>
<p>so each playerfile has a variable, well i added a custom one, and what i want to happen is when i use ::update, it changes said varable to 1,  for all players online and offline before it restarts the server, how would i go about doing that?</p>
<p>aswell as how can i make the server automaticly do ::update every 24 hours?</p>
