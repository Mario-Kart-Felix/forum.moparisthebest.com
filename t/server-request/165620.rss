    <title>Server Request</title>

    <description>Hey guys

Can someone PLEASE make me a server? They will have free adminship, spawn ability, and membership. (If you can set that all up. ;)

You can be co-owner. But there&#39;s one exception. I&#39;d have the ROOT account, you can have the co-owner account. I can give details of how I&#39;d want the server made out. Here they are

Things to start with on default account:
- Robin Hood Hat
- Mystic robe top and bottom
- Abby Whip
- Prayer book
- and if you can make them have 1m when they start, that&#39;d be good.

Different things:
- Admins and Members can spawn items, no one else.
- I&#39;d like the map just like the one in Project Czar, the one that starts you near the gaming place.
- I would like it if there were teleports to the KQ, Dagganoth, Rock Crabs, and maybe a few more places.
- It&#39;d be pretty cool if we had an Edgeville wildy teleport.
- Having an altar that converts you to ancients (not in the middle of the desert) would be good, instead of a side-tab. 
- If you could put it on a Silab Client, that would be good.

Please, everyone, if you could make the server, I would help all I could at running it. My computer is low memory so I can&#39;t make a server very well. Thanks!

If someone would donate a server that they don’t want anymore, it’d be highly appreciated. (I wouldn’t steal it or anything, or change the password, but it’d be cool to spawn items when no one else can. xD)</p>
