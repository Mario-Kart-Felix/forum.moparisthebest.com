    <title>How to delete object? Help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-delete-object-help/382417</link>
    <description>How do I delete an object thats in between two co&#39;ords? Such as a tree or a fence post?? Or a bridge that takes up more than one co&#39;ord??
deletethatobject(xxxx, xxxx);
What do I do to delete it? I can walk all the way around it, its like just for looks cause theres no collision cause you can&#39;t step there. I don&#39;t get how to delete it. Help?</description>
