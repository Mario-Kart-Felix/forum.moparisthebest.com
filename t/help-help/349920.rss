    <description>Hi guys i have recently been coding 317 and Have now just moved up to 508 today and I must say it is a big change........ well not that big, but big enough that I need help. So since I am completely new to a 508 I need a person with teamveiwer to help me code it. When I mean help me I mean dont do it for me I want you to be like my guideline. Some things I want to code my server with a fairly easy such as change Home location and change were Its wildy and were its not, shop reloction and some other stuff. The source i am use is Mithscape [100% leech from them]. So yea thank you in advance.</description>
