    <description>i just recently found the codes for customs and i was trying them out and i noticed that when i attacked w/ them they didn&#39;t work and it switched to punch. how do i get this to oroperly hit hit? 

and all of the specials dont work either, how would i get them to work?

items that dont work:
dragon claws
bandos scimmy
god scimmy
supreme claws 
tri godswords (dual)
saradomin sword  &lt;--works properly but spec dosn&#39;t work

i appreciate any help and would like to thank you for helping in advance

<p>if (playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 13664) { &lt;–d claws<br>
special amout &gt;= 100<br>
calculateSpecial();<br>
specialDamage = 0;<br>
specialDamage = 0;<br>
specialDamage = 0;<br>
specialDamage = 0;<br>
useSpecial = false;<br>
}</p>

              <p>I agree with the two above. You can’t just put the code and bonuses of the item in weaponhandler.java and expect it to work. Also there ARE indeed tuts on this. You shouldn’t post a Help topic if theres a tut on it. That shows how much you know and tried.</p>
