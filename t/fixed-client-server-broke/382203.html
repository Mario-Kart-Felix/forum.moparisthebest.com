<p>[s]<span class="bbcode-b">Short story:</span><br>
When I log in, it freezes. I tried everything I know to fix this. I redownloaded the client, but it still doesn‚Äôt work. I redownloaded the cache, but it still doesn‚Äôt work.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Full story:</span><br>
Please help. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs wrong. I was just standing around on my PI server (it‚Äôs not online or anything) looking for cool fish on a list on notepad. I added a few items using commands and their image appeared blank. I was wondering WTF was wrong at that point, but I was like whatever. Then, every other item I added thereon (like 5 items) had a blank icon, no drop model, and no wear model. So, I closed and reopened the client. The items were back to normal and everything. A little later (like 3 minutes) I added another item. Guess what‚Ä¶the icon was blank and everything. So, I did the same thing. I closed and reopened the client, but this time, it froze when I logged in. I then saw the error in the Client.bat. So, I thought it was just my cache. I had a backup of the cache when I first downloaded the client (downloaded like a week or so ago). So, I replaced the cache, but it still showed the error and it still froze on log in. So, I thought it was my client (that‚Äôs my problem, client is freezing), so I replaced the client folder (I also had a backup of the client), but it still does the same thing every single time. I tried restarting my computer and everything. What do I do??</p>
<p>By the way, those green things are legs, and are always there when I first log in. The change clothes interface appears for a second when I first log in (not sure why). Now, my problem makes it last forever (frozen).</p>
<p>Also, I made a new character, and it logged me on, but it was SUPER LAGGY at first. I then relogged back in and it was fine, except that in the cmd it still says ‚ÄúError: T1 - 123,0 - 36,36‚Äù. At least it doesn‚Äôt freeze. I‚Äôm starting to think an item broke me!</p>
