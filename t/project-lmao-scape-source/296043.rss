              <p>Alright to start tater hah get it…anyway to start off i read every single post that flamed him, i read it all. And you said that was constructive criticizm yeh…right, Criticizm is a way of telling someone that they didnt do great. BUT YOU GIVE THEM ADVICE. without the advice part. its just flaming. LIKE U DID. so before u say ohhh you didnt read it all. You dont know what your talking about tater. You are what we call. “an idiot”. So im sure you will respond to this in one way or another. but until then. Quit flaming people. U can criticize thats cool BUT DONT FLAME. and yes so you all know my servers basicly suck. but i will get better. SOMEDAY.</p>

              <p>That was completely uncalled for.</p>
<p>This entire thing started because I told him that asking for rep was against the rules and that his server was nothing new.</p>
<p>Then all you people started flaming me and saying that I had never done anything better. I then had to prove you wrong. If you had read the comments rather than trying to start a flame war you would find that I have never said anything that I would say was unfair and I have given advice. Instead you the slime of the community just came here because your bored.</p>
<p>And just so you know I released a source less than a week ago. I am currently working on another based on Devo 2.7. So before you go throwing wild accusations l2read.</p>

              <p>Gotta throw my two cents in on this, First off everyone has had a bad source while coding. I’m not saying this ones bad ive never played it. Second Tatemo and all u other “big dogs” of coding. Ur all FUCKING DICKS. instead of putting down every new coder that comes on here. why dont u show some support throw out a couple ideas. HELP. i know its new concept tuff to get through those 13 year old minds of yours. But honestly you don’t know the guy that made this server. And just because u dont think it that great doesnt mean everyone has that mind set. If you guys run your own servers why are u even in here. To leech wud be my guess. So why dont u get your thumbs outa your asses give this kid some props for doing something im sure you havn’t done in a long time its called “TRYING” again a new concept for you all. But other then that there ya go WAY TO GO DUDE. dont give up just cause these ass holes put ya down. My first server BLEW!!! but i went right back to it studied up some more got better and still getting better. YOUR NEVER PERFECT. but u can be good. GL THERE BUDDY!</p>
<p>CHECK THIS OUT!! got bored thought u might like it.</p>

              <p>I coded noobscape for 2 years and yes it was my first source. Tbh it’s not actually that nice horrible conventions and a lot of unnessary code. Tasham scape and Zombiescape are pretty good. Cleaned Czar is the best though. Or maybe project covic. If you want an example of what good code looks like look at the animator code in project covic. I made that and it’s about the most perfect in you can get imo.</p>
<p>If you tried and spent time on it I am sure you could make a source better than noobscape. It’s all about dedication to coding. I never released a source before Noobscape because they weren’t really good enough or anything new I recommend that more people on mopar think before they release.</p>
