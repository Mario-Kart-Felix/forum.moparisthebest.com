              <p>Well, I’m not sure if this works for all 317’s, but if your using delta - this is what mine looks like…</p>
<p><code>    case 3:
        yell("The mighty owner of ServerName -" +playerName+ "- has logged in!");
}
switch(playerRights) {
    case 2:
        yell("Admin -"+playerName+"- has logged in!");
}
switch(playerRights) {
    case 1:
        yell("Mod -"+playerName+"- has logged in!");

<p>I can’t tell you a huge lot on the subject of whether or not this will work as it is, but this can push you in the right direction.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
