<p>Are boys born loving trains and guns while girls reach for dolls and pretty pink dresses? Are boys born with various brains, enabling them with areas science and math, while girls naturally master literature properly as the written word?</p>
<p>You may remember, in 2005, when the president of Harvard modest, Lawrence Summers, created type of uproar with disparaging comments about women’s aptitude for science and math. Well, perhaps true you can use dramatically more men than women in top amounts of the science fields, you’re the gender differences hard-wired?</p>
<p>This debate has raged on for a lot of, the age-old nature versus nurture, science-brain versus art/literature-brain. Studies have produced loads of results from various studies, often conflicting, but the matter remains not likely resolved.</p>

<p>But with america, the gap is often narrowing. Girls who have been respected as “highly gifted mathematicians” now # 3 to, an unlimited improvement rather than the 13 1 ratio bad observed in the 1970s. Women obtaining graduate degrees in math may also on uptick, even if these are still holding 70% of these kinds of degrees.</p>
