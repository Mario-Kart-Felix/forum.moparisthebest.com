    <title>Packet 164(Walking)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/packet-164-walking/367924</link>
    <description>Ok, so i recently posted a help topic about an error that happened in my run.bat when i tried to walk.
I had no idea what it was, so i used google a little bit, and looked around and it turns out, there is an unhandled packet, and the packet is 164 which is the walking packet. So that makes a lot more sense now, because i got the error when i tried to walk. So i have an unhandled packet that need to be fixed, and i have no idea how, please help. Here&#39;s the error.

[client-1-Daltonn]: Unhandled packet [164, InterFaceId: 51083, size=5]: ]0B B6 0
D 00 8B[

Please help, thanks.</description>
