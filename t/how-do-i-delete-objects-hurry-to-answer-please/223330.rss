    <title>How do I DELETE objects?!?!?!??!?!?!??!!?!?!?!?!?!?!???! HURRY TO ANSWER PLEASE!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-delete-objects-hurry-to-answer-please/223330</link>
    <description>Okay It helped, But now I have to figure out how to delete objects.. There&#39;s a Potted plant and Coordinates it says (1158) (3029,3378)

I searched for (3029, 3378) and (3029,3378) and client.java but it didn&#39;t find anything.. I tried with some other items and it wont work.. 
I know that I&#39;m a noob ATM but to become a nonnoob.. I have to learn. :)

Thanks ~ Exotz.</description>

<p>Mini tut time. Lol.</p>
<p>Open client.java and search for:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">        deletethatobject(</code></pre>
<p>Now this is an exapmple deletethatobject code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">        deletethatobject(0, 0); // Furniture</code></pre>
<p>All you have to do is copy and paste the code above into the deletethatobject list and then change the 0, 0 to the X Y coordinates to the object that you want deleted. <em>optional</em> Next change " // Furniture" to the name of what you are deleting, I recomend this so if you want to “undelete” this item you can just erase the code. <em>optional</em></p>
<p>Hope I could help. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>easy, go into client.java and search for:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">makeGlobalObject</code></pre>
<p>in that there will be tons or little depending on what the base person used.</p>
<p>here is an example of one:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">makeGlobalObject(2654, 2590, 5276, -3, 10);//Main Bank</code></pre>
<p>The first id would be the object id, the second two id’s are the coordinates, and the -3 is what way it is facing.</p>
<p>Hope that helped.</p>
