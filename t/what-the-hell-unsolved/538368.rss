    <title>What the hell? *UNSOLVED*</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-the-hell-unsolved/538368</link>
    <description>Okay guys sorry, I feel like a complete amateur here.. Wow... I&#39;ve went through about six different source/clients today trying to find a good one. But now my search has changed from a good one, to one that actually works?! All of them have something wrong with them, serious. That makes them not work, I got Eclipse and Updated Java, I followed some Java guides on how to fix these &quot;Simple&quot; problems but none of them worked so obviously it isn&#39;t so... Simple after all. I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me please?


*EDIT*OKAY! EVEN WITH THE EASIEST OF SERVER STILL GET THIS SAME ERROR ON THEM ALL!?
