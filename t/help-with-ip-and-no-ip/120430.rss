    <title>Help with IP and no-ip</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-ip-and-no-ip/120430</link>
    <description>Ok, since I am still a little new to this, I am trying to figure out how to tell what my IP is, i am using choob island as a source, and i don&#39;t see it displaying my IP address anywhere like a read in some other sticky. when i connect to my server howerver, it connects me to 127.0.0.1 which i assume is my local?  Also how do i go about using the no-ip thing? Sorry if this post seems a little noobish, i dont usually post much since i get most of what i need browsing and searching here.</description>
