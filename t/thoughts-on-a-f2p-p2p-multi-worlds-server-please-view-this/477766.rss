    <description>[center]Well today I have been having a discussion with my friend about starting a new server. We have came up with loads of ideas. 

Our best idea was to do a multiple world server that could either be like a 2006 remake, or a newer version, as we are still undecided about which.[/center]

[b]World 1-[/b]
[u]F2P[/u]

[i]This world would have the free to play element to it, where all &#39;members objects&#39; come with with &#39;member&#39;s object&#39; when you hover over them. There will be no members mini-games (eg-pest control, castle wars, etc..) but will obviously still have the duel arena. The wildy will become full with rune scim pures, green d&#39;hide pures, etc.

Members will still be able to access this world, but all members objects become &#39;un-usable&#39;, this will just sit in the inventory as &#39;members object&#39; etc.[/i]

[b]World 2-[/b]
[u]P2P[/u]

[i]Then we could have a P2P world which would cost like 3.00 GBP a month or around that mark, then have deals on if you buy more then one months subscription. This will obviously have everything unlocked, eg- dragon, black d&#39;hides, mini-games, all skills etc..[/i][u][b]We was just wanting your feedback on this. Could you please copy and paste this and fill in the answers::[/b][/u]

1) Do you think this is a good idea and give reasons for this?



2) Do you think it should be based on a earlier year so theres no items such as &#39;dragon claws&#39; (even when in members world) etc..?



3) Can you give us anything that you think could improve this idea?



..

Many thanks in advance,
Lee.</description>

<li>There are already several runescape remakes that offer free membership</li>

<p>Base it on the 474 or 459 era</p>

<p>If you want to stick with the idea of two servers, make a PK server and a normal economy server. Otherwise just don’t. It won’t turn out well trust me. Try getting your player base up to 100+ then releasing the second ‘world’. Why have two worlds with 15 players?</p>
