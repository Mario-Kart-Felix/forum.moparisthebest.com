    <title>Fletching and Smithing Lag You Out</title>

    <description>I&#39;m using TorvaPkz source and the same thing happens to both skills when you try to train them. You lag completely out to the login screen. When you log in your ore will be smelted/smithed or your arrow shafts/shortbow/longbow would be crafted. Does anyone know why this is happening? I would really appreciate any help from anyone. Thanks.</description>
