    <title>How to delete an object in 525!?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-delete-an-object-in-525/395296</link>
    <description>Hello, I am using a 525 source and its Hybrid PVP.
I am wanting to move my servers home and I used doors.cfg to get into my new home.
It will not work, so i want to just delete the doors.
How can I delete the doors, I know the object code already.
Thanks.</description>
