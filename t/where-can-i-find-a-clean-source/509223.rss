    <title>Where can I find a Clean Source?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-can-i-find-a-clean-source/509223</link>
    <description>Hello,

I am looking to build my server completely from scratch. I have had a few servers in the past for learning measures, and was looking instead of encountering all the bugs from getting a source, that I would instead build my own from the ground up. I remember back years ago when WhiteKastle (sp?) had a clean source for 317 (Sp?) and I am pretty good with Java. I would like a newer rev, but I can always just get a new one and get the keys to update it. A newer one would however save me time on doing that.

Thanks,
Delaura</description>
