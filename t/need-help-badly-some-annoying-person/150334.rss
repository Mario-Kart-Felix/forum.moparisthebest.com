    <description>Hai guys, i was wondering if its possible to ban someone, even though they have an ip changer... Thing is with this.. These are the 2 hostmasks/connectedFrom.

68-184-38-52.dhcp.oxfr.ma.charter.com
c-98-200-241-86.hsd1.tx.comcast.net

Now, when i like, track to get a perm ip, it comes out with..

98.200.241.86
68.184.38.52

.. Now theyre in different states .. :S..

So like, with SYIpkpker, he has a dynamic IP, and people say you CANNOT ban him, yet Kevin/Guthan posted on rune-server, how to stop him perm.. So thats possible..

Is it possible with this situation? If so, how. Would really appreciate.

- P.S - Are UID&#39;s the same from every client, or does it vary for each person?</description>
