    <title>Need help with safezone setting. I got the code, I just don&#39;t understand it</title>

    <description>Ok I am trying to make safezones on a hiyascape server that are around the shops and that is it. I know you may think that sounds stupid but I have an awesome plan. 

[code]|| (absX &gt;= 3229 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 3242 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 9796 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 9807)[/code]

Ok theres the code for a nonwild area. I don&#39;t understand how to read it exactally. If I am trying to make a box that is a safezone, how would I enter in the coordinates into that code of the box I want around the shop area?</description>

              <p>Ok I read that but it wasn’t clear to me. This is what I got from that topic.</p>
<p>These are my coords<br>
Top left: X = 2519 Y = 3906<br>
Bottom left: X = 2519 Y = 3877<br>
Bottom right: X = 2557 Y = 3877<br>
Top right: X = 2557 Y = 3906</p>
<p>So thoes coords make up my square or rectangle whatever shape it comes out to be. In the first example of that topic, the code used to show a coordinate was this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">|| (absX &gt;= 3343 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 3111 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 3441 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;=3523 ) ||</code></pre>
<p>So in my case for my first coordinate, top left, would be</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">|| (absX &gt;= 2519 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 3111 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 3906 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;=3523 ) ||</code></pre>
<p>Then the second code used is showing how to make the square I am guessing. The code was this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">|| (absX &gt;= FIRST COORD .A. &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= FIRST COORD .B. &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= SECOND COORD .A. &amp;&amp; absY &lt;=SECOND COORD .B. ) ||</code></pre>
<p>This is the part where I get confused. Jcrane says that FIRST COORD .A. is my X coordinate, and that SECOND COORD .A. is my Y coordinate. Then Jcrane says that to get FIRST COORD .B. I will have to go to the right top and get my X coordinate, and then for SECOND COORD .B. I am guessing I will have to go to the right bottom to get my Y coordinate.</p>
<p>The part I don’t understand is that there is a X coordinate and a Y coordinate for EACH corner, yet from what I understand, Jcrane is saying to take the X coordinate only from my top left, my Y coordinate from my bottom left, my X coordinate from my top right, and my Y coordinate from my bottom right. But this wouldn’t make a square. So going back to the first code… or better yet, using the code that is in my servers nonwild() section I am guessing I am going to have to have 4 lines of code, each line telling a coordinate, am I right?</p>
<p>That would look like this:</p>
<p><code>
|| (absX &gt;= 2519 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 3242 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 3906 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 9807)
|| (absX &gt;= 2519 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 3242 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 3877 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 9807)
|| (absX &gt;= 2557 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 3242 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 3906 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 9807)
|| (absX &gt;= 2557 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 3242 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 3877 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 9807)</code></p>
<p>Is that correct? I don’t think it is but mabye I got lucky. Please, any help would be awesome, I am totally lost here. I don’t think I will be on much longer tonight but I will stop in and check this topic later. Also sorry this is so long and if it is confusing I apologize again. Not the best coder out there… Well thanks in advance. :)[br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 11, 2008, 06:29:18 PM[/size][hr]Holy crap… It worked! Awesome!
