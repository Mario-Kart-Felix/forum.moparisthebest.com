    <description>Anyone going? Anyone gone? The latest one is in Ohio, and it&#39;s just a few hours away. Just wondering who is going. I am. basically what it&#39;s about is it&#39;s a meeting of 1,000s of Christian teens in one area to fast and worship for 12 hours, which isn&#39;t asking that much. It&#39;s supposed to be a revolutionizing experience, it&#39;s nickname is the turning point, the door-hinge of the century. It&#39;s going to be amazing.

ThAt0n36Uy, I do not want to create any kind of argument with anyone, but I do however have some questions for you. I personally am not Christian, nor am I part of any other “big” religion. I am tolerant of other religions, but I do see some flaws in what I have seen/heard. My first question for you is about what you say about God. Now, all of the Christian people I have talked to either are religious - but are because of a fear of God, are not religious at all, or are religious but will turn around and sin before leaving the church. Also, I understand the things that cannot be scientifically proven in the Bible and other holy books are where God steps in, but I personally wonder, do you believe in the Bible’s alternate theory to creation? I am not fully aware of it, but from what I have heard and seen it is against evolution. Also, what are your personal beliefs on how God would separate those who would go to Heaven from those who would go to Hell? I know you somewhat explained it, but I would like to understand your point of view better, so please use examples if possible.<br>
+A,lso, a question for juju, I’m sure you must realize it, but are you aware that your signature [God made me an atheist, who are you to question His wisdom?] is an oxymoron?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I asked that anyone who wanted to continue talking about religion PM me. But I’ll go ahead and answer your questions. It is true we should be afraid of God, he is almighty, infinite. We’re finite beings, we cannot comprehend what he thinks. I can agree, there are many many Christians, who have one face in church, and one face at home. It’s very sad, though it’s also what makes us human. I haven’t ever heard of an alternate method of creation that rivals Intelligent Design and the Theory of Revolution. There is the literal take of Genesis, which is generally used for smaller children.</p>
<p>What you said about things cannot be scientifically proven. That may be true, but there have been things that have been proven, and well documented. As for my beliefs on how God separates people. I can’t really say. I believe that when people die, they stay dead, they stay in the ground, until the end of the Tribulation, when God returns to reign for 1000 years on Earth. But in saying that, there is a Judgment, it’s called the Throne Judgment. Where all Christians are judged on the way they acted, in front of people, and away from people. That is only for Christians, and that comes after his 1000 year reign. So in saying that, I don’t know if Atheist’s, or people of other religions go to Hell instantly or not. I do know, that when God sets up his throne, Satan, Antichrist (and his false Prophet) are sealed in a bottomless pit. And only after the 1000 year reign will Satan be released. So during that time, the torturing, and the lake of fire are all maintained by the Angels.</p>
<p>I guess it really depends on how you interpret the Bible, I don’t think God chooses who goes to Hell and who doesn’t, he only saves those who have repented, and accept him as savior. And the ones who do, but are not faithful, they’re sent to Hell, or go through the trials of the Tribulation (If they survive till the tribulation).</p>
<p>EDIT: On a side note, do I have the most mutes in one topic? Do I get an award?[/quote]<br>
I’m sorry, I did not see the thing about the PM. But seeing as we have already started :P…<br>
I have had most of my questions answered [thank you very much] but one still lingers. If there is a Heaven, and it is by God’s will that one is sent there, why is he to be feared? Wouldn’t God rather have people choose their own fate without his direct influence, then let them live out their consequences?<br>
Thank for your responces.<br>
And yes, you should win said award.</p>

A Friend of TheCall is anyone who helps support TheCall financially by making a one-time or monthly donation.  Below are the three main categories of monthly pledges, but please feel free to give the amount you are most comfortable with, even if it’s not listed here:<br>
Student Partner Friend of TheCall - pledges a monthly gift of $20 or more<br>
Partner Friend of TheCall - pledges a monthly gift of $100 or more<br>
Business Partner Friend of TheCall - pledges a monthly gift of $1000 or more. (If you are interested in becoming a Business Partner Friend of TheCall, please contact Paul Amabile at 816.285.9353 or email <a href="mailto:Paul@TheCall.com">Paul@TheCall.com</a>)[/quote]</p>
<p>ahh, what cars to the organisers drive? lemme guess, 2008 porsche? :)[/quote]</p>
<p>Actually, everything is done on donation. The event is free to attend, and the people that come to play at the event or speak, are not paid. The donations are only taken so TheCall can continue traveling around the world. They have to pay for using the arenas, and they have to pay the crews that do the lighting, sound, stage, camera, etc.</p>

<p>There are a lot of theory’s around, a deity creating the earth and all beings on it for one, however, that deity must have evolved from something. You can believe that evolution created us, a deity did, or that we’re all “sims” in a computer game being played by someone. You must ask yourself, if god created us, who created him? If he just “appeared” and created us, and decided whom would go to heaven and hell, who lead us to a better world and <span class="bbcode-s">healed</span> performed miracles, <a href="http://whywontgodhealamputees.com/god5.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">then why doesn’t god help amputees?</a></p>
<p>I don’t believe in a supreme deity, because that’s just me. I didn’t like RE at school, and I still don’t. The fact that Moses didn’t eat or drink for 40 days while god told him the 10 commandments couldn’t be true, even if he did, it seems that the 10 commandments are all to similar from the 42 negative confessions from the Egyptian Book of the Dead. Many people seem to be forgetting, Christ is not the earliest religion and a lot of what has been said in Christ has been said before.[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t pretend to understand God, or why he doesn’t act upon the hurting, the poor, etc. If anything, I wish he would help the hungry. Just because it doesn’t happen doesn’t mean Christians agree with God about it.</p>
<p>The Bible says specifically, God has always been, and always will be. You could interpret it that we may be just a simulation, and that it’s some child, playing the game.</p>
<p>About Fasting, people have Fasted for extended periods of time, it is very possible that he had fasted for 40 days. <a href="http://en.epochtimes.com/news/4-5-18/21492.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"> Worlds Longest Fast</a></p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>[quote=“ThAt0n36Uy, post:28, topic:172696”]Well, I went it was an enriching experience, I feel revived. To all of the people that posted in here flaming each other, I feel bad it came down to you using my topic as a place to vent your anger on each other (That doesn’t include Dragonus or Legit). But to answer your question Legit, I wouldn’t say it is an atheist forum, but I definitely think there is a lack of Christianity, or other religion here.</p>
<p>But the whole problem with there being religious people here, is that most people that use the computer remove themselves from areas of life like that, and most of what they say is hearsay, or misconstrued. Which inadequately represents that religion, or side of the argument. You obviously should know that, but don’t pick and choose who to represent a religion, I saw what you said about Java, or someone, and I can see you know. But most people try to find the mot ignorant, and completely arrogant person to argue with.</p>
<p>As for what you said Marluxia, It’s like a core group of people in a university, College Campus, or High School. That just pray corporately and continuously over issues covered in the Call, or issues they feel called to pray about, hence the furnace, it is an intense time of fasting and prayer.</p>
<p>And to reply to what you spoke about Kane, I’ll just give you some information about Fasting and Prayer. Fasting is what this man Lou Engle, the Creator of ‘The Call’ began to do. Fasting is an important part of Christians lives, the more hardcore Christians. Fasting allows us to remove the un-pure worldly things from our bodies, to be closer to God. Ridding ourselves of worldly tasks, like feeding and Television, gives us an opportunity to focus more on God. Hence the fact TheCall wasn’t advertised to be a corporate event. The bands that came weren’t stated, the speakers who came, their names weren’t given. People who came, came to revive themselves, to come closer to God.</p>
<p>We went, and spent a full twelve hours of fasting, and during that full twelve hours there were businesses open, who were serving very good food, and if you were to go into the courtyard around the arena, you could smell the food, and there were people who chose to eat. Which you didn’t have to fast, but it was better for you to. By eating something after stating you were doing a fast opens you up to corruption. And evil things. I won’t go on about that because I don’t want to offend anyone. But I just wanted to clarify there were businesses there.</p>
<p>We didn’t spend the full 12 hours praying, but we did spend an hour or so on each issue that happened to come up. A few famous bands came, and we had speakers on very important issues come. I can’t say who they were, but I may just say one or two. Ron Parsley, came, and that may say something to people who know who he is. But he didn’t come and preach about giving money or something. People may say that he’s a conman, and I can’t say I don’t agree.</p>
<p>We prayed about Abortion, Adoption, The War, Pornography, and other areas of Youth and Teen life. Kane, random orgies, is a sin, and really goes against what Christians believe. It was a very useful event, and important to everyone who went. I only brought the event up because I was going, and wanted to see who else might be going. I didn’t post it for the event to be criticized, if you don’t understand what it was for, you could have just left it alone.</p>
<p>As for you Hiaburi, I can’t say I agree, I think that is totally incorrect. You may or may not agree with what you said, but I’ll give my reply to that statement to you since you said it. We need religion, and more specifically, Christianity.</p>
<p>I may sound intolerant, but my God is the only important thing in my life. I can do without the evil of this world. Between the content on the internet, the TV, and at school. It’s all turning against Christians. You say life would be better without Christianity, I don’t see that. I see, that without Christianity, with out The Lord God Jesus Christ. There would be no life.</p>
<p>You think that this universe was formed by chance? That the Big Bang just occurred? I don’t think so, There is a Higher Power, there was a force that caused it to happen. I am a student of Intelligent Design, I believe there is a God, and he created the universe, the occupants of this universe, and the other heavenly bodies.</p>
<p>And my one last reply. Original Daniel, these were the best spent 12 hours of my life so far. I think I’ve stated earlier the importance of fasting. I think you don’t understand the life of a Christian. You might see what being a Christian is like on TV, online, what people say, or at School.</p>
<p>Well, this might be some devastating news to you. We don’t try to be good people because it gets us into heaven. We do it because we want to be more like God, we do the right things, not because we’re looking for people to see, we do it because it must be done.</p>
<p>We remove ourselves from evil areas of this world. And you may try to make the argument that the pastors of the Catholic Church, or the African church have molested children. Let me just say that they needed to be caught, it’s a horrible thing that they’ve done. But for one screw up, or many. It shouldn’t matter, our priests, pastors, preachers. They shouldn’t be made a public spectacle, Christians are only human. We do make mistakes, just as everyone else does.</p>
<p>About your ‘sell bibles’ comment, we don’t carry bibles around everywhere, and just give them out to people, some do. I carry my own personal Bible with me, but I don’t go and evangelize, or give a Bible out to random people. I can’t really say I’ve seen people do that. There is a group of people that put Bibles in Hotels, and give them to the troops.</p>
<p>If anyone has a question about the call, or where it’s going to be next (Florida), I’m still here. If anyone other than me went post about it. Anyways, to the people I replied to too, if you still have some argument, or want to flame me. Just take it to private, I’ll do my best to give you information, or defend my side.[/quote]</p>
<p>you sound like an advertisement on wheels</p>
<blockquote>We do it because we want to be more like God, we do the right things, not because we're looking for people to see, we do it because it must be done.</blockquote>
<p>sigh, that’s rather funny, your God is not good nor nice, I mean, he sentences people to infinite pusnishment for finite sins, he banishes people from gardens - in general, he’s not someone i’d like to meet.</p>

<p>It’s a 2 hour movie in a few parts, stuff about the Amero, federal reserve bank and other problems. The first part is about religion, and part of it talks about how similar Christianity is to many other older religions.</p>

<p>There are a lot of theory’s around, a deity creating the earth and all beings on it for one, however, that deity must have evolved from something. You can believe that evolution created us, a deity did, or that we’re all “sims” in a computer game being played by someone. You must ask yourself, if god created us, who created him? If he just “appeared” and created us, and decided whom would go to heaven and hell, who lead us to a better world and <span class="bbcode-s">healed</span> performed miracles, <a href="http://whywontgodhealamputees.com/god5.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">then why doesn’t god help amputees?</a></p>
<p>I don’t believe in a supreme deity, because that’s just me. I didn’t like RE at school, and I still don’t. The fact that Moses didn’t eat or drink for 40 days while god told him the 10 commandments couldn’t be true, even if he did, it seems that the 10 commandments are all to similar from the 42 negative confessions from the Egyptian Book of the Dead. Many people seem to be forgetting, Christ is not the earliest religion and a lot of what has been said in Christ has been said before.</p>

No-one can prove there is a “Higher power”. And say, theoretically, there was… where did this “Higher power” come from? It can’t have just been there.[/quote][quote=“darkdemun”]if there is a Higher power, where did it come from? an even Higher power?[/quote]<br>
Yeh, basically just re-wrote my post.</p>
