    <title>Oh noes! Vista backup gone wrong!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/oh-noes-vista-backup-gone-wrong/160280</link>
    <description>Well, yesterday, I just made my friend really really angry. Unfortunately, he had vista, and I was downgrading it. I backed up his stuff, and I was sure that I told it to back up Documents and Settings, and after 30 minutes, it SAID it backed up around 6.4GB.

Well, after that, I re-formatted, and re-nstalled XP. I put the stuff from my portable hard drive onto his desktop. I go to my house, and he says that there is nothing there.. Now he says he needs a file from my hard drive. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t find this file! It was extremely important! Everything except for a couple files, including that important file, has been deleted... Victim of Vista?</description>
