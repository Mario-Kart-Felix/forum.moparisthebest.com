    <description>Hey guys! First let me start of by saying Whoo Hooo it&#39;s summer! I&#39;m an okay coder (can&#39;t do much client sided) and I am looking for team with one or two people to make a really good server. If we do get this up we will split the profits (after excepting donations and such) I can almost guarantee you guys that we can actually make this happen. 

Server Name: [b]~~xyst~~[/b]
VPS: [b]coming soon!~[/b] (will cost around 15-30$)
Website: [b]coming soon!~[/b] (will cost around 3-10$ domain / unknown for webhost)

I have wanted a good server for quite a while and after failing very bad many times I have turned for help from my fellow moparscapians. 

P.S. I have some code that i wrote myself including ancients, farming, summoning and commands. Stuff like that is the easy part. Hope to see you on the ~~xyst~~ team! :)
