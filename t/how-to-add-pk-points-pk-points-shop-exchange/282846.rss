    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-add-pk-points-pk-points-shop-exchange/282846</link>
    <description>ok, so i was wondering how i could add pk point onto my server..and make it so it can keep track of that persons pk points, so whane ever they logg in it says &#39;so and so has this many pk points&#39;..also, whenever someone kills someone [1v1] a message comes up for them that says&#39;

&#39;you now have this many pk points&#39;..

and how can i make it so the amount of pk points they have, go towards a shop, that you can only but st00f with a certian amount of pk points..

*EDIT: i DID use search bar [and www.google.com] so don&#39;t post any stuff that says try search bar or google.com..because i already used it.

NOTE: it doesn&#39;t have to be EXACTLY like i described..just sort of similiar..thanks everyone! please help me btw :( 

BTW i don&#39;t really know if this matters, but i&#39;m using EmpireScape source 317 [NOT ADVERTISING]. please post. TY!</description>
