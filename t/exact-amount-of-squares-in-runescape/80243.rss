    <title>Exact amount of squares in RuneScape?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/exact-amount-of-squares-in-runescape/80243</link>
    <description>Anyone have an idea of how many squares (the ground spots) are in RuneScape?

I was just wondering, because I want to do a non-pk server, and I&#39;ll just do like safeZone = 1 | 4000 or what ever it was for safe zones..</description>
