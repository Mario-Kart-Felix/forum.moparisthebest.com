    <title>Looking for some help with client programming. (Java, possible also Groovy)</title>

    <description>Okay. So, this is a java based client for a game called Haven And Hearth. 

Here is my problem, so, there is a client called Enders and the updated version does not run bots, while the undated version does.

I would like to find someone to either help me discover why the updated version does not run the bots, or someone to help edit the base client to adapt all of the needs for the game.

Links to clients

Older version with botting system: [url=http://github.com/k-t/Haven-and-Hearth-client-modified-by-Ender]http://github.com/k-t/Haven-and-Hearth-client-modified-by-Ender[/url] (scource)
[url=http://dl.dropbox.com/u/21381676/kthaven.zip]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/21381676/kthaven.zip[/url] (Client) 

Newest version of client: [url=http://www.mediafire.com/hnh_ender]http://www.mediafire.com/hnh_ender[/url]  (full client)
Scource: [url=https://github.com/EnderWiggin/Haven-and-Hearth-client-modified-by-Ender]https://github.com/EnderWiggin/Haven-and-Hearth-client-modified-by-Ender[/url]

I&#39;m not sure where to even begin, me and my friends want a client made that is able to do everything we need but we have no knowledge of how to do so other then making a few bot scripts.</description>
