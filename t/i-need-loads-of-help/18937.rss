<li>Give up on making your own server until you have some actual in-game experience. Private servers are very different from Runescape.</li>
<li>Go to the “Server Advertisement” section, pick a server, get on it, and stick with it. Lear the bugs, tricks, and codes. THEN, try making your own server. Hopefully after you play for a while, you will realize that you cannot get anywhere playing Hybridscape.</li>
