    <title>[Bots] Breaking or not breaking? [/Bots]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bots-breaking-or-not-breaking-bots/397323</link>
    <description>What&#39;s your opinion? I&#39;ve heard many people say that if you don&#39;t make the bot take breaks, there&#39;s less of a chance to get caught. But if this were true, why would bots like RSBot still have that option available?

yes, and you’d get soo much REM rebound it’d suck</p>

              <p>If there is any truth to this the act of removing breaking from popular free bots would take away the idea that breaking makes you get banned easier because then Jagex would know that the majority of botting sites don’t use breaks. What a conundrum.</p>

<p>But my opinion is, you shouldn’t bot more than you sit at your computer; in this case, you do not need breaks and you seem like a real player.</p>
<p>You know how people say botting Soul Wars is a easy way to get banned?  I went there for 2 months, botting, but instead of leaving my bot on all the time, I just ran it when I was on my computer.  Got 99 hp from it.</p>
<p>So basically what I’m trying to say is, you need to seem realistic.  Don’t bot long enough that you have to set a break timer, etc.  It’s fairly easy to get caught nowadays if you don’t know what your doing.</p>
