    <description>when a site (forum) has too many moderators. the site will not be very good [or in other words very efficient].
because all the moderators usually have the same power.
and every moderator want something different.
i think a software should be created for moderators. this software gives every moderator a limited control over sections of the website. sometimes moderators fight over where a topic should go. when every moderators have a limited access to his section this will may reduce this fights. and there should be a head of moderators. so when 2 or more moderators fight. he can solve between them.</description>

              <p>No I didn’t think it was about me. I didn’t think any of your post was about this forum. If two moderators, as you say, both were fighting over a forum problem then it appears they should not be moderators. Most moderators on this website are quite mature, and I doubt we will ever have a problem like that.</p>
<p>I see what you are trying to say, if each moderator is given a section to moderate then it will motive them more. Sure I agree with this. Though there are select problems that happens when this happens.</p>

<p>just because you are moderator it doesn’t mean that i am speaking about you or any one here.</p>
<p>i am speaking about this in general and i didn’t pull this from my ass like you did. [br][br][size=1]Posted on: June 21, 2008, 06:56:19 AM[/size][hr]and by the way why whenever someone mentions something on this forum you moderators think its about you. just keep cool. if i want to say something or anyone using this forum about you; we will say it in his face. just remember not every topic posted on this forum it speaks about you.</p>
