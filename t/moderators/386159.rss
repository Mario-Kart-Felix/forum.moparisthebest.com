    <description>Is it just me, or have I noticed a great decrease in the moderator activity :|

Quit?

Just not being active?

Am I going crazy?

Ok, how about my original system. However, MITB or some mods could have some pre approved quality assurance people (sorry Corey).<br>
Once the 10 votes are submitted, it is sent to all online approved people, and atleast 33% must agree to remove it. If non are online, all on that list receive it, and the first 1/5 of those members votes on the removal of the topic are the ones that affect the final decision.<br>
[/quote]That’s basically exactly the system we have now; with the quality assurance people being mods[/quote]</p>
<p>Mods can automatically do that though without the whole voting system. This is just a slower process.</p>

<p>At first I thought the same thing, but Mopar’s right, most of it is gone before we see it. When Obamabinlaffen’s posted them threads there was no mods online at that time. Which is bound to happen at some point in the day - a carefully planned out attack I suppose. Still fail.</p>

<p>I’d have to agree, once a thread is reported it tends to get dealt with pretty fast. The only issue is, when I see a thread which breaks the rules I just report it. Many other members just contribute to the rule breaking and leave negative comments - then don’t report it.</p>
<p>I think people see a bad thread as an opportunity to make them selves look ‘cool’.[/quote]<br>
This.<br>
If I remember and memory serves me right, I do believe that it’s against the Rules to post on a thread after reporting it or it being bad or something like that.</p>

<p>You may think that they aren’t doing that much but thats because they catch things ahead of time, without them there will be at least 50 rule breaking threads a day still live on the site. Just cause some of them have a life doesn’t mean you should create a whole topic to rant on them.</p>

<p>What the hell? Where in my post did I say that they didn’t do much? All I stated was that I haven’t seen them as active as they usually are. It doesn’t mean they aren’t active, it just means I haven’t seen them <span class="bbcode-b">as</span> active.<br>
Also I wasn’t ranting, I was asking a question.</p>
