    <title>[READ ME] Help-topic issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/read-me-help-topic-issues/519498</link>
    <description>This topic isn&#39;t about getting help (well, not directly anyways). I&#39;m tired of coming to this section to help kids and see this:
Help Please
NEED HELP 317!
CAN&#39;T LOGIN WHAT DO I DO
Need Pro Coder to fix
How do I change this
Can&#39;t log in

Etc.

You guys. If you want some help, seriously make better topics.
Ex:

[317] Changing Yell titles - PI
[718] Players login with bad usernames - NameOfSource
[508] How do I change the IP

ETC.

We can only help you by the information you provide us. There are thousands of private servers, and more being released every day, probably one being release as I type this and you read it. Give us all the information you can. Make an informative topic title.
You also want main post to give the most information possible:

Revision: 317, 377, 474, 508, 525, 562, 667, 718, 742 or what ever.
Base: Matrix, PI, Allstar, Hyperion, Delta, Rune-Source, etc.
Description of error:
While I was editing this thing it gave me this error below. Can someone explain what this error is and some tip on how to fix it?
[code=java]
if(codeTag.startsWith(&quot;[code&quot;) &amp;&amp; codeTag.endsWith(&quot;=java]&quot;){
system.println(&quot;You&#39;ve made a java code tag! Good work);
}
[/code]
[Obviously that wasn&#39;t an error ;) ]
Pictures of the error:
I don&#39;t have a real error, so:
[img]http://thedailycatblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/kitties-in-teacup1.jpg[/img]
MAKE SURE TO USE IMAGE BRACKETS!

Other information:
This is where you&#39;d tell us what files you were editing and anything relevant to the error.


-Thank you for reading, and I&#39;ll gladly accept my infraction, because I know I&#39;m getting one-

-I&#39;ve gone and changed the name of the thread because it&#39;s more of a discussion and such</description>

Most took longer than need too.

Because I sit in this section for ~4 hours reading threads and attempting to help, most I ignore because they are either a higher revision than I use, or I can't tell what they are using. I do what I can..

I would hope the admins knew that this section is the most active (well, for server related) and it needs more sectional mods than norm. Or like you said, give the server helper’s some mod powers, like locking, moving and editing. Or at least just editing. So they could at least fix a post to make it look better for others to read and help.[/quote]the change hasn’t happened when suggested in the past from more well known community members, it won’t happen now.</p>
<p>the fact of the matter is, server help section isn’t fully ‘active’ it just has a massive amount of posts that don’t belong in this section, and a prune would make our community look even more dead than we are.</p>
<p>we can’t solve the problem by simply giving more people power. staff can only do so much. the problem that we face is with ourselves, and until then, this will always be a problem.</p>

</aside>
<p>I understand that we can’t make a change happen over night. But by sitting here, not taking any action, we aren’t stopping the issue. I would hope the admins knew that this section is the most active (well, for server related) and it needs more sectional mods than norm. Or like you said, give the server helper’s some mod powers, like locking, moving and editing. Or at least just editing. So they could at least fix a post to make it look better for others to read and help.</p>

<p>It is purely cosmetic. I could also argue that the java guru badge is not useful. They are simply the fruits of one’s labour (which in this situation would be the obvious amount of time invested into assisting others).</p>

<p>I’m still not entirely sure what you meant when you said making use of that badge. If you want to make a name for yourself by helping, then put a large majority of your time into the assistance side of the forums and actually help (that wasn’t directed at you, just a generalization).</p>

Community support can easily be gathered by the input of members within this thread. If you would take time to rearrange this thread layout in order to provoke a discussion in different areas, or at least add a poll providing options on whether or not you support the current rules/guidelines, then it would be all that much easier for you to gain some form of support.<br>
I can tell you, though, that as long as an administrator or moderator would agree with presented ideas/concepts, then there is a possibility that it can go through to a staff meeting without community support.[quote=“3lv3n snip3r, post:15, topic:519498”][quote author=sk8rdude461 link=topic=637962.msg4300126#msg4300126 date=1368848641]<br>

<p>What people should do is what I did when I started learning html/css. A couple of months ago, I started programming with html/css. Of course, I didn’t know much about either of the languages, but I didn’t post hundreds of threads on how to do things. I searched it up and studied it. Yea, my codes weren’t the best at the start, but they progressively got better and look at me now, I have made a few decently appealing simple web templates.</p>

<p>But you had the patience, and the motivation. The problem being is that this section is littered with those members who only have half of the motivation spectrum, but none of the patience spectrum.</p>

This is what I’m talking about.<br>
The end user (the person seeking help) loses our because they can’t seem to make an informative post and people like Elven and myself are too lazy to decrypt a thread to fix a 2 minute issue.<br>
If the section rules were to entail better guidelines on making a post, and yes, there needs to be guidelines, then sectional moderators could get to work on making this section a little better.[/quote]<br>
I’d be more than willing to create a new set of guidelines with you and have a fun little discussion.<br>
What you must understand, though, is that there is no real problem with the current rules and guidelines - it’s how they are enforced.</p>
