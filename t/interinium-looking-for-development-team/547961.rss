    <title>Interinium - Looking for Development Team</title>

    <description>What is Interinium?
Interinium is simply a learning experience for myself that may or may not pass beta stages. I have no plans whatsoever to host the server soon, but to build it up to near perfection; code wise and player preference. I wish to get as much feedback, suggestions, and constructive criticism towards the server from those who actually play as I can. The server is based around the grinding effort it takes to get the bank you want, so you can finally risk it all in wilderness as endgame content (I have many ideas to make PvP more exciting).

Looking for Development Team
I started out this project as a solo project, but to get the best progress and nicest additions to the server, I decided to expand the team by a few members with the same mindset as me: not in it for the money, but for a good time and enjoyable learning experience. I&#39;m not a Java guru whatsoever, but that is the reason I created the project -- to learn. Anyone willing actually sit, learn, teach, etc. can and may be accepted to the team.

Future of Interinium
As stated above, the server may or may not be pass the beta stages, but it&#39;s just too early to decide whether or not. If given a lot of time and development it is very possible to get the server hosted with full-scale advertisements, website, and development team.

Images, update log, etc. will be posted in near future. Reason for thread as of now is to find a partner in interest 

Interested? Skype is tyler_tassin</description>
