    <title>My own offline rsc server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-own-offline-rsc-server/554071</link>
    <description>Hey, I&#39;ve been googling for hours to setup my own RSC server, fooled around with n00bscape v3 and that didn&#39;t result into much at all.
The conclusion being that this will take me way too long to setup, if I&#39;d eventually be able to that is.

I&#39;d like to know if anyone is willing to consider to make me a server that I can use personally, and being able to add items/change stats.

What it comes down to: I just want a server of my own where I can go crazy with items, stats and overall just fool around. 
It has to be user friendly as I am total beginner in coding.

Is this even possible? If so, I will pay for it.</description>

              <p>I’d recomand you to start with NoobScape v3, it’s pretty simple … but if you can find Yong’s latest release BrutalPkers it’s more developed and lot of bugs fixed. If you need help i can give a hand on skype .</p>
