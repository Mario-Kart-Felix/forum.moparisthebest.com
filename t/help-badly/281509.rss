    <description>OK i follow this guide  &quot;How to get your compiler to work (Setting up ANT and JDK) (WINDOWS XP)&quot; and i followed everything, but i think i made a mistake somewhere along the way. When putting in the path of the Java and the ant. OK when i go to any server don&#39;t mater if its rsc or rs2 i press run, and it opens up and go back away in about a half of a milla second. what happened??? I followed the guide and when i got done installing the ant and java and then went into the environmental variables and added them. I pressed OK then OK again. I went onto my server and i would not run. then i tried many other server/clients that were not mine and it did the same thing i said earlier on the post.</description>
