You can’t say something so confidently. It makes you seem ignorant.</p>
<p>I don’t believe that intelligent people will ever band together in order to recreate the era, but I do believe it is possible. However, it took Jagex 5 years of server development with a large, highly qualified team, so a much larger amount of work would be needed than what anyone has exerted so far.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well seeing as we already have all of the models and ideas, more than half the work has already been done without even having to touch any code.</p>

<p>You can’t say something so confidently. It makes you seem ignorant.</p>
<p>I don’t believe that intelligent people will ever band together in order to recreate the era, but I do believe it is possible. However, it took Jagex 5 years of server development with a large, highly qualified team, so a much larger amount of work would be needed than what anyone has exerted so far.<br>

The client would have taken up the majority of the developers time. You also need to remember that recreating RS in 2006 would require documentation on the entire game from that era. You cannot trust sources such as RSWiki as they change previous articles to be updated to the current revision and to my knowledge, there is no public archive. You can get close from viewing the thousands of videos and images from the time, but you cannot get it perfect. So generally speaking, with a team of experienced developers, it could only take a few months to get to the point of being basically the same - but not exactly the same. Btw, if I’m wrong in any of this, I’d like to be corrected.[/quote]<br>
completely true, but the developers would have to dedicate their entire time to it over those months. there would also have to be a team of devs (hence plural)</p>

How often do you see somebody with 200 reputation releasing a virus in the server downloads?

<p>You can’t say something so confidently. It makes you seem ignorant.</p>
<p>I don’t believe that intelligent people will ever band together in order to recreate the era, but I do believe it is possible. However, it took Jagex 5 years of server development with a large, highly qualified team, so a much larger amount of work would be needed than what anyone has exerted so far.<br>

The client would have taken up the majority of the developers time. You also need to remember that recreating RS in 2006 would require documentation on the entire game from that era. You cannot trust sources such as RSWiki as they change previous articles to be updated to the current revision and to my knowledge, there is no public archive. You can get close from viewing the thousands of videos and images from the time, but you cannot get it perfect. So generally speaking, with a team of experienced developers, it could only take a few months to get to the point of being basically the same - but not exactly the same. Btw, if I’m wrong in any of this, I’d like to be corrected.[/quote]<br>

<p>It gives general ideas of what updates there were in 2006. If you click on the updates, it gives you the link to the exact change “documentation”. On the bottom there is also an index showing all of the years Runescape has been around, and you can look at the previous years so you know what to add. It would be a pain to do it, but I can imagine that this is the best public database of all Runescape updates/content.</p>
