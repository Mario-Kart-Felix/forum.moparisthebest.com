    <title>Server blocks connections from 3rd party clients</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-blocks-connections-from-3rd-party-clients/371256</link>
    <description>My server automatically blocks connections from third party clients and only allows them from my client. The problem is that I just started my own client and I would like for my server to allow connections from any client. Im using a delta base, how would I go about doing this?</description>
