    <title>Help with commands? Rep++</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-commands-rep/448434</link>
    <description>Ok so I have a hybrid pvp v3 source and in the commands.java file is all the commands. So I look in it and I don&#39;t see any if player rights = 1 , and all that. How would I add it so that mods + could use that command. I see nothing? I uploaded the file if you want to look yourself. Example: the command ::item. If i want that to be mod + how would I do that. I don&#39;t see it at all</description>

<p>If its like my server mod commands are under this line of code :</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>

I checked your file.
Your mod commands are located under the line of command
[code]    public void moderatorCommands(Client c, String playerCommand)[/code]

Simply add any mod+ commands you want below that line.</code></pre>

              <p>If you read this nice little piece of code here it should deduce the obvious <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p><code>
if (c.playerRights &gt;= 0)
        playerCommands(c, playerCommand);
    if (c.playerRights == 1 || c.playerRights == 2 || c.playerRights == 3) 
        moderatorCommands(c, playerCommand);
    if (c.playerRights == 2 || c.playerRights == 3) 
        administratorCommands(c, playerCommand);
    if (c.playerRights == 3) 
        ownerCommands(c, playerCommand);
        if (c.playerRights == 4) 
        DonatorCommands(c, playerCommand);
}</code></p>
<p>You will see that there are specific voids for each player rights commands i.e:<br>
the item command would go under</p>
<p>[tt]public void administratorCommands(c, String)[/tt] or [tt]public void ownerCommands(c, String) {[/tt]<br>
It’s all really a matter of placing the commands under the right void method.</p>
