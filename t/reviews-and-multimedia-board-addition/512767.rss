Recent addition to the general interests and hobbies section, this board is welcome to anyone wishing to have their work commented on (original songs, writing, etc), or any reviews you have written in the past.


We know topics like this have been posted in general discussion for a while now, it was brought to our attention that a new board would be suitable for these types of topics.</description>

<p>Moparisthebest is strongly against this idea iirc, I think there was a topic about it made on <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> and he wrote down his views on it, which I agree with to an extent. It would be easier visiting one site than two but at the same time I think <a href="http://Moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparisthebest.com</a> should stay as is. It would also cause a lot of issues, gravedigging wise. There’s topics that were last posted in in 2011 on the first page which isn’t exactly ideal.</p>

The most common being video with audio and text (like a youtube video, or TV commercial). Plain text is not considered multimedia. Oddly enough, by the wording of the section you could post a review of a book, but not make a post just about a book. Maybe it needs to be reworded <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

[/quote]Yeah, and it was shut down for good reason. No idea why this went through to be honest, it’s already dead less than a week later. I don’t see why we have to have new boards for things that are fine in other boards, when we don’t have the content to back it up. Making a RS07 board is good, because the RuneScape board was getting flooded with it. We made a Minecraft board when General Discussion was getting flooded with Minecraft stuff, but… I see nothing to warrant this. Oh well.<br>

<p>Moparisthebest is strongly against this idea iirc, I think there was a topic about it made on <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> and he wrote down his views on it, which I agree with to an extent. It would be easier visiting one site than two but at the same time I think <a href="http://Moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparisthebest.com</a> should stay as is. It would also cause a lot of issues, gravedigging wise. There’s topics that were last posted in in 2011 on the first page which isn’t exactly ideal.<br>

Well MITB has way different categories, and a much more ‘intelligent’ member base, I don’t think that the would want a bunch of topics in the computer sections who’s titles are<br>
“HELP MEH I TINK I HAZ VIRUS”[/quote]<br>
They aren’t a much more intelligent group of people, they’re just older therefore seem smarter and wiser. You can’t really compare an average age of 16 against an average age of 20+, there’s a whole load of differentiating features that make them seem a lot more intelligent where in actual fact they’re just more mature.</p>

Might as well no one even posts on MITB any more, the top 4 or so thread creators have spammed MITB for a while now.<br>
[/quote]<br>
That’s the problem, the topics are all outdated and people will effectively be posting on year long dead threads.[/quote]</p>
<p>So what if the threads are old, people can still create new discussion in an older thread. The only reason no one posts is because most of the people on here don’t even know it exists just like the wiki.</p>
