    <title>Dragon Claws Spec</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dragon-claws-spec/419674</link>
    <description>Well, I downloaded this source and client and I go on and just mess around with what is already coded up to this date. There are dragon claws on it but when I hit speical, it waits e time until your next attack and then just turns the special thing off basically like what would happen if you don&#39;t have enough special left. Anyone know how I may fix this?</description>
