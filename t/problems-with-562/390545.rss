    <title>Problems with 562</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problems-with-562/390545</link>
    <description>Okay heres my problem:


I have ElementX 562 source &amp; client, it worked fine on local host but when I tried to put it on my VPS and run the client it says that no internal or external java could be found or used or something I forget. When I try to connect to the client it has a [b]Error_game_Js5connect[/b] (Which I hear is an error between the source and client connecting to each other). I have changed my IP in the client and this is the first time I have tried to put a server online. Am I missing other places to put the VPS ip?</description>

              <p>The only .java files you should need too change your ip would be client.java</p>
<p>Make sure that the VPS has java I guess xP, and that you didn’t mistype the ip… I’m not really good with VPS as me and our friends host em, but I’m just trying too point you into a direction.</p>
