    <title>Help - A command making someone else do something!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-a-command-making-someone-else-do-something/190338</link>
    <description>I need help adding a command or a void that makes someone else do something. It&#39;s also making like the player say something. I understand all that, i just don&#39;t understand how to add a personal (&quot;P.&quot;); If i could understand that or someone could explain it to me, that could be great.

I need to add one.</description>
