    <description>i was wondering how to efficiently color something in meta.
i know how to color things. but like the void trident where it all has gray but alot of diff values (shade of light and dark)
or is the only way of coloring in meta doing the inhumain material craetion over and over and over again unless its a primative?..
oh and another thing that has been killing me is how to make things appear as if they&#39;re emmiting rays of light... or do i have to make loads of materials and just change the alpha alot on a whole bunch of them?   
(im working some awesome models but need the glow effect o make how i want. i&#39;ll put up more soon)</description>
