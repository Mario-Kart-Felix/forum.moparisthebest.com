Problem: Clicking to follow a player sends a trade request.

Basically the first option when you click a player in my source is to follow them.  It was until I added trading which made following a player send a trade request instead of the trade with option.  Even after you send a trade request with follow, you still follow the player.  So how could I fix this to make the trade with option send the request instead of the follow option?  All help appreciated.</description>
