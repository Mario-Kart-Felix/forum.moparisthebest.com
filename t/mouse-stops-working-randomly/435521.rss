<p>Well, i got a new mouse and its working fine. I tried the ‘Glitched mouse’ on another computer and it works fine as well. Its weird that it stopped working after a few months, but oh well.</p>
<p>Also, I thought Ubuntu was made for inexperienced Linux users, so it more safe, and has patches. As opposed to ArchLinux, which includes nothing and is made for experienced users.</p>
<p>Thx guys for your help<br>
[/quote]True, but you won’t be doing  as much on archlinux as you will be on regular ubuntu thats why it’s safer overall. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>and after you saying what you did it probably was just a hardware issue with ubuntu.[/quote]<br>
Im going to submit a bug report to ArchLinux right now, in case anyone else is having this issue.</p>
