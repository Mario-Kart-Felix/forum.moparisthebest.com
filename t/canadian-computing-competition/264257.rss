    <title>Canadian Computing Competition</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/canadian-computing-competition/264257</link>
    <description>I had this competition at my school, they gave us 3 hours to complete 5 programs. Pretty sure I did them all correctly.

i attached the scanned pages and the programs i wrote zipped
(ye, they&#39;re all in java, but any language was acceptable so this doesn&#39;t really fit the java programming section)

discuss: how i did, what i did dumb, how you would approach these problems, etc

i had to upload problem 5 cause i cant attach anymore...

              <p>I have the same competition going on at my school today. Sadly I only got to make the first one work and this is junior too.  Its more of a logic understanding competition compared to what you program.</p>
<p>This is my code to the first question in the Junior section</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class J1 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
		ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; aList = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
		
		for (int a = 0; a &lt; 3; a++) {
			System.out.print("Digit "+(11+ a)+"? ");
			aList.add(keyboard.nextInt());
		}
		
		//91		
		int val1 = aList.get(0);
		int val2 = aList.get(1);
		int val3 = aList.get(2);
		
		val1 *= 1;
		val2 *= 3;
		val3 *= 1;
		
		int total = val1 + val2 + val3;
		total += 91;
		
		System.out.println("The 1-3-sum is "+ total);
	}

<p><em>edit</em> damn lawl, impressive work (my logic sucks so much compared to your work)… nice stuff <em>edit</em><br>
<em>edit2</em> dammit, it pisses me off that I wasn’t able to get the logic as straight out as i see it in your work <em>edit2</em></p>

              <p>looks exactly like the ACM programming competition (which is targeted at tertiary education institutes) <a href="http://cm2prod.baylor.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://cm2prod.baylor.edu/</a></p>
<p>though it went for 8 hours and was 7 or so problems, was great except for only having 2 out of 3 people</p>
