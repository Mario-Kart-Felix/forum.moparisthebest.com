    <title>[PI] D Claw Special, Lunar Interface, PVP Armour</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-d-claw-special-lunar-interface-pvp-armour/378874</link>
    <description>Well, I think considering this has been my first server, I&#39;ve done really well so far.
But I&#39;m having trouble with DClaw Specials, Lunar Interface and PVP Armour.. Maybe I&#39;m just sick of coding today, but I don&#39;t think so.
I don&#39;t want this to turn into a flame thread and nor do i expect to be spoon fed.
Just hoping for someone to lead me to some tutorials, as I&#39;ve had no luck searching.

Thanks !</description>
