    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]China used prisoners in lucrative internet gaming work[/b]

Labour camp detainees endure hard labour by day, online &#39;gold farming&#39; by night

As a prisoner at the Jixi labour camp, Liu Dali would slog through tough days breaking rocks and digging trenches in the open cast coalmines of north-east China. By night, he would slay demons, battle goblins and cast spells.

Liu says he was one of scores of prisoners forced to play online games to build up credits that prison guards would then trade for real money. The 54-year-old, a former prison guard who was jailed for three years in 2004 for &quot;illegally petitioning&quot; the central government about corruption in his hometown, reckons the operation was even more lucrative than the physical labour that prisoners were also forced to do.

&quot;Prison bosses made more money forcing inmates to play games than they do forcing people to do manual labour,&quot; Liu told the Guardian. &quot;There were 300 prisoners forced to play games. We worked 12-hour shifts in the camp. I heard them say they could earn 5,000-6,000rmb [£470-570] a day. We didn&#39;t see any of the money. The computers were never turned off.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Exactly, but it is a fact that minorities are usually more victim to poverty and are uneducated, which is what that video describes. It was partially Obamas fault for lying though so meh.</p>

<p>Color is only a problem when decisions are made based solely on it, even in the interest of ‘anti-racism’ or ‘Affirmative Action’ as we call it here in the USA, which is why in college I couldn’t get any type of financial aid because I was a white male, there were scholarships available for every other color you could imagine, and for white females.  One day I’d like to have enough money to start a scholarship fund specifically for white males, bet I get sued for it! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>How did chinese golfarming turn into a race debate again?</p>

<p>No, frell, the ONLY people who ever claimed voting for McCain was racist was fox news and white supremacists, want to know why? Actually, I won’t tell you but I’m sure it’s fairly obvious.[/quote]<br>
What? Thats why when I was in school during the time black kids would say “boy you racist” if you talked about McCain. Thats why they let teachers hang pictures of Obama on their doors, but when the white teacher who put up a picture of Bush/McCain (one of those) she was forced to take them down. It was a double standard.</p>

<p>Shit like however is racist Frell. First off, where the fuck do you get your figures from? 9.2%? try 40-45% verified from multiple sources you fucking retard, but that isn’t the real issue here, who are “they” who got their black president? 95% Of black people voted for Obama, they must be racist <span class="bbcode-b">AND ONLY VOTED FOR HIM BECAUSE HE IS BLACK</span>!!! Oh My God!!![/quote]<br>
Pulled the wrong %. I don’t consider them racist, I respect that they wanted to have the landmark of the first black president.</p>

<p>Did you know that in 2004 John Kerry got 88% of the black Vote? How about Al Gore getting 90% in 2000? Did you know the Democrats always get the huge majority of black and minority votes going way back to 1976? I’m pretty sure you didn’t know that but whatever. Democrats also get the majority of lesbian, gay and bisexual vote too, 75% to 25% isn’t as impressive as 90% to 10% but whatever. 34% More people in the 18-29 age group voted for Obama, I’d say that was a lot fucking more significant than a tiny % of people voting for or against him because of his race.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes I knew Democrats get more minority votes, because minorities struggle and usually need government assistance, and they will obviously vote for the party continuing those benefits. You’re looking at percents, look at numbers. Look at the NUMBER of people who have never voted before, that came out to vote for Obama, that along with Acorn allowing people to vote with fake names, AND LOOK AT ALL OF THE FRAUD DURING THE ELECTIONS.</p>
<p>[quote=“Niall, post:70, topic:397996”]Frell, you’re against unnecessary spending, how much money do you think it would cost to verify that the 131 million voters have the correct, arbitrary level of education? On top of that, do you REALLY want your government keeping records of everyone’s education? I thought not. But as I have already pointed out, Obama being black had very little to do with how people voted for him, and I’d be willing to bet just as many racists voted against Obama purely(haha, get it?) because he was black. Oh, and how exactly will having an education mean people won’t vote on a president because of their race? I don’t get this but whatever.</p>
<p>Ps, fun fact, 17% more white people without a college degree voted for McCain. -<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/11/04/obama-wins-how-he-did-it_n_141231.html" data-bbcode="true">source</a>[/quote]<br>
Now your post should have ended after the black argument, you just quoted something that I blatantly said, just to say it. I wasn’t saying “OH WE SHOULD DO THIS.” But you ignored the very last statement of that sentence just so you could complete your quote montage.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter, you hate me. Youll take any chance you get to bombard me. This all coming from the once Administrator who said if I ever got 50 rep he’d do everything in his power to make sure I wasnt a Community Member.</p>

<p>No, banks were pressured by the government under carter to give loans to people they normally would not. The idea was they would get triple in return once that class graduated college etc. But no, since the banks gave loans to people they shouldn’t, and wouldn’t have, a good amount of those people could not pay them back. If you’ve ever seen the movie wallstreet 2, Gordon Gekko actually gives a college speech during the movie that is spot on real facts, and he explains why the market collapsed, not blaming Bush or blaming Obama.</p>
<p>Oddly enough the plan was supported by following leaders and collapsed in 2008. Im willing to bet the destruction was hidden under the internet boom during Clinton, though.</p>
