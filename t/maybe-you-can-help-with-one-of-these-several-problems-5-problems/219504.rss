    <title>Maybe you can help with one of these several problems? 5+ Problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/maybe-you-can-help-with-one-of-these-several-problems-5-problems/219504</link>
    <description> :o I am sorry I know very little about this but maybe you can help me learn.

Problems:
1. In my client it shows  NPC&#39;s it has coded into it. I typed one of the NPC&#39;s into my Autospawn.cfg and it came up in game as a tree?

2. When players die they go to the old &quot;Home&quot; not the new one I had made.

3. I&#39;ve used a source that you could go up to level 127. How do I do that?

4. How do I add items to a client?

5. What does &quot;Declare&quot; mean? Someone made a tutorial that told me to &quot;Declare&quot; I was just wondering.

6. If I made an item and It only worked in my client. What would it be in other clients?

7. How do I change the outside of my client. The chatbox and all of that.</description>
