    <description>Ok here&#39;s my situation. My step-dad wont let me host my server from my computer because of viruses and stuff like that. He sais if i somehow upload the files to the web and let a webclient run off those files which are uploaded i am allowed to do it. Can anyone give me an answer or maybe even instructions to do this? I also still want to be able to change files such as client.java.</description>
