    <title>Getting my server online</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-my-server-online/393855</link>
    <description>Okay, so I&#39;ve been messing around with a server source for a while, and I want to get it online so I can mess around with my some friends and try to update the server to their oppinions.

This is also somthing i want to know how to do before i consider using a VPS.

To some of you this will seem like a pointless post but heres my problem:

I have a server file, and a client file; I want to be able to connect to myself but not by connecting to &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;.
so heres what I&#39;ve done so far.

[IMG]http://i245.photobucket.com/albums/gg77/smallkid176/pfwd.png[/img]

This is my port forward settings, I&#39;ve used my straight i.p I havn&#39;t used no-ip or anything like that as I will be trusting the people I allow on this server, hopefully this is not a problem.

I have then went to the Client folder and opened a a file called GUI.java 
&lt;blockquote&gt;public static void main(String args[])
	{
		new Gui(args);

	}

	private Gui(String args[]) 
	{
		super();
			try {

			Serverip = &quot;I  put my Ip address here&quot;;
			sign.signlink.startpriv(InetAddress.getByName(Serverip));
 			initUI();
		} 
		catch(Exception ex)
		{
			ex.printStackTrace();
		}
	}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I then tried saving it as Gui.java and this did not work so i saved it as the GUI.Class aswell, and it still did not work. i have backup copys so there is no big issue but if you can let me know if i should save as .java and .class or .java that would help a lot:P

Well thats pretty much my attempts and after doing this it has not worked yet. Maybe there is somthing I need to change in the server folder, please let me know.

thanks for viewing my thread:) I&#39;ve tried to include all the information i can to help.</description>
