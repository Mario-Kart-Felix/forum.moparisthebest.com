    <description>[center][b]Sponsored Servers[/b][/center]

If you would like to get a spot on the Sponsored Servers list, follow the instructions on this thread to get started:
http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,345841.0.html

Now to the info:
[b]1.[/b] The cheapest you can buy a spot for is $30/month, but that is because unlike the other sites I guarantee there will be no more than 10 sponsored servers at any time, which means you get much more traffic because your server doesn&#39;t blend in.
[b]2. [/b]You may pay more than $30 in increments of $5 ($35, $40, etc) and the servers will be ordered with the highest paying at the top.  Those that have paid the same amounts will randomize positions among themselves every time the page is loaded, resulting in equal time in each position.
[b]3. [/b][u][b]Most Importantly![/b][/u] All the proceeds will be kept in my paypal account and used to pay people for developing a very good server to be released open source.  If you want to make good money by programming a server, please look and inquire here:

Thanks, and I hope you all look forward to quality programs coming from the site soon!</description>
