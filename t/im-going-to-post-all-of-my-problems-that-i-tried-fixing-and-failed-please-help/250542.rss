    <description>Ok I use this an Allstarscape source and here are all of my problems I have:

1. When you switch to ancients and put in any other command it automatically switches you back to modern magics.

2. My runserver.bat eventually after like an hour it glitches up and says that &quot;player is already online&quot; and freezes the whole thing. Here is what it reads: [code]Client type: high memory version

<p>I go to varrock and I’m fine, another player could go to varrock and it will freeze their client and they can’t leave, I have to go into the char files and fix them. Or sometimes I go to a place, like barbarian village and it freezes me up but then my other players can go to barbarian village and they can go there no problem. <span class="bbcode-b">THIS REALLY SHOULDN’T HAPPEN!</span> If anything, I need this fixed immediately. I’m scared to make new areas because if they work fine for me, I don’t know if they will work fine for EVERYONE else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My Admins and I on my server can’t use the pm system because whoever they pm it will freeze the person’s client receiving the pm.</p>
</li>

<p>Lets say two players go to ::teampk. They both walk north 6 steps into the wildy. They begin to fight each other. One of the players puts in ::teampk again and teleports backwards 6 steps. Now to the other player, it appears he is still in the wildy, meaning it doesn’t update the position of the player on the other player’s screen. So it appears to the other player that this player is still in the wildy but he isn’t. The only way to fix is kicking him but I don’t like doing that every time.</p>
</li>

<p>I finally found out like a month ago how to make my npcs attack back. After that I wanted to make it so if you attack it and run away, it follows you and I did that. The problem was if you tele away it will keep following you and it will go through the wall and leave but then just randomly stop in the wall. So I made it so if you are within 1 step at the npc it will hit you and if you leave it won’t follow you, but that’s not what I wanted. If you go back up to the npcs even after leaving the area it would continue hitting you. Basically this is what it is right now. If you go up to the npc and you hit it, it will hit you back. If you take one step away from it, it won’t attack back anymore. If you walk back up to it, it will continue hitting you. If you teleport away, and go back there and walk back up to the npc, the dang thing will still attack you. If you mage it from far away, it will take one step toward you and that’s it, then it won’t hit you. The whole thing makes me mad because everything about it I don’t want. I want to make it so if you’re next to it and you attack it, then it will attack you back, which it’s doing right now, but if you take 6 steps away it still hits you but if you take 7 steps away it won’t. But then I want to make it so if you walk back up to the npc after you stop hitting it, it will stop hitting you and wanting to hit you. I CAN’T FREAKING DO IT! I HAVE TRIED SO HARD! This is from my npchandler.java and this is what makes my npc attack back:</p>

<p>the &lt;= 1 thing is what makes it so if you take more than 1 step away from it, it will stop hitting you. If I change that to a 6 and you take more than 6 steps away from it, it still comes after you and if you tele away, it still comes after you and goes through the wall and I get so mad over it. I have tried switching both the &lt;= 1 and the &gt;= 1 but it still won’t work. I have no clue what to do.</p>
<p>Of course you will probably say “then switch sources”.  <span class="bbcode-b">I AM NOT SWITCHING SOURCES!</span> I have already coded so much into this one so I can’t just leave it. Please help me. I have been in an epic battle with these problems for a long time now. I have tried and tried and tried and tried SO hard, going through my files, my client.java, my npchandler.java, my server.java, changing things, editing things, please do not come here and say I need to try to do it myself and please do not say “we do not spoon feed”. Trust me, the last thing I want to do is just copy and paste it. Here’s something to think about: Part of the reason I don’t want to switch sources is that is just running away from the problem. How am I going to learn how to deal with problems if I never face them and fix them? So please help me. I think putting all of these in one post is good because then I don’t have to make multiple topics.</p>
