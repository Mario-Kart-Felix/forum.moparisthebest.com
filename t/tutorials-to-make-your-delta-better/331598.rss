[b]1. basic coding knowledge[/b] [[i]1000[/i]]

have you ever been called a noob because you don&#39;t know how to code? or because you&#39;re asking really silly questions? well look no further, here is the guide that (i hope) will help you become noob-free!

note: if by the end of this section there was something you didn&#39;t understand and i was unable to explain, visit http://www.informit.com/library/content.aspx?b=STY_Java2_24hours&amp;seqNum=10

step 1: downloading an IDE

first, i recommend you download an IDE. an IDe is an Integrated Development Environment that was created to help you program more efficiently. for example, instead of doing all the conventions yourself, these programs will help you by spacing them out yourself! and sometimes if there&#39;s this error you can&#39;t seem to find, the IDE will help you find the error in the code.

&lt;blockquote&gt;An integrated development environment (IDE) also known as integrated design environment or integrated debugging environment is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of:

    * a source code editor
    * a compiler and/or an interpreter
    * build automation tools
    * a debugger

Sometimes a version control system and various tools are integrated to simplify the construction of a GUI. Many modern IDEs also have a class browser, an object inspector, and a class hierarchy diagram, for use with object-oriented software development.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

i suggest you try out either one of those IDEs:

http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

http://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html

eclipse is probably favoured by more people than netbeans but netbeans is really for beginners. so if you just started out, you should probably download it.


step 2: downloading a source

first before you learn to code RSPS, you need a source! here&#39;s the download section for all your server downloads and needs:

http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,49.0.html

really, you&#39;ll want to download a simple server without any of the &quot;extras&quot; and add them later yourself, that is of course if you even want to learn how to code. then you&#39;ll be able to do w/e you want with private servers and in the end you&#39;ll be gaining learning experience.

step 3: really learning to code
alright you downloaded a source, now open up client.java and search for [code=java] public void[/code]

what you see right now is called a method. a method is a piece of code that acts on data, and often returns a value. It&#39;s basicly a piece of code that tells Java to do something with some data. you can declare a new method like this:
[code=java]
public void playerNames() {
        if(playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;abc123&quot;)) {
                sM(&quot;YOU PWN KAY?!?!&quot;);
                yell(&quot;AW EM GEE PWNAGE!&quot;);
                pwnage = 1;
        }
}
[/code]

notice that at the end of every line i wrote, i added a &#39;;&#39;. this signifies the end of a line of coding. and when i started the void, i added () after the void name and a &#39;{&#39; at the end of the code. a { means the start of a block. a block contains a few lines of code, and using blocks organizes your code. for example o could do this:

[code=java]
if(playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;abc123&quot;))
        if(playerRights &gt;= 1)
                sM(&quot;YOU PWN KAY?!?!?!?!&quot;);
                yell(&quot;OMG THIS GUY PWNS!&quot;);

                yell(&quot;OMG THIS GUY SUCKS!&quot;);
[/code]

notice that when there were no blocks, it was really dis-organized, and the program will probably not be able to understand how to execute the code. for example, to fix this i would add:

[code=java]
if(playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;abc123&quot;)) {
        if(playerRights &gt;= 1) {
                sM(&quot;YOU PWN KAY?!?!?!?!&quot;);
                yell(&quot;OMG THIS GUY PWNS!&quot;);
        } else {
                yell(&quot;OMG THIS GUY SUCKS!&quot;);
        }
} else {
        sM(&quot;example.&quot;);
}
[/code]

notice that for every { there has to be a }. this is to tell the computer where the block starts and where it ends. for example, this code would make it so if your player name is abc123 and your player rights are bigger than or equal 1, then it will continue with the block. after the block closes(with a &#39;}&#39; ), i added an else. that means that if the condition in the statement above the block wasn&#39;t met, then it will ignore above code and replace it with the following which was &quot;OMG THIS GUY SUCKS!&quot; and then i closed the block again. at the second &#39;}&#39; i added another else, and this one was for the playername. so it meant that fif your player name was not abc123, then it would completely ignore the code and continue with the following.

[code=java]
if(powerlevel &gt;= 1000) {
        sM(&quot;IT&#39;S OVER 1000!!!);
}
[/code]

if statements are conditional statements. for example, the above code said that if your power level was bigger than or equal 1k, then it will send the message &quot;IT&#39;S OVER 1000!!!&quot; to you. if statements are probably the building blocks to the whole java language, because if they didn&#39;t exist then think where we would be now.

[code=java]
if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;pure&quot;)) {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 25; i++)
        addSkillXP(999999, i);
}
[/code]

for statements are like multiple lines of code. for example, in the ::pure command, i added this:
[code=java]
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 25; i++)
addSkillXP(999999, i);
[/code]

this meant that int i can hold any value from 0-24. then, addskillXP will add 999k xp for any skillID with a value of i (0-24), hence the uses of a for statement.

[code=java]
                if(command.startsWith(&quot;yell&quot;)) {
                        string titles = &quot; &quot;;
                        if(playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;ytuio3&quot;)) {
                                titles = &quot;GOD&quot;;
                        } else {
                                if(playerRights == 1) {
                                        titles = &quot;[Moderator]&quot;;
                                }
                                if(playerRights == 2) {
                                                titles = &quot;[Administrator]&quot;;
                                }
                                if(playerRights ==  3) {
                                        titles = &quot;[Co-owner]&quot;;
                                }
                        yell(&quot;&quot;+titles+&quot; &quot;+playerName+&quot; : &quot;+command.substring(5)+&quot;&quot;);
                }
        }
[/code]

a String is a way of storing data that should be a piece of text. of course it could store numbers because they are text, but it&#39;s better to use int for storing numbers. a string&#39;s uses are demonstrated above:

[code]
1. if player name is ytuio3, then the string titles is going to be equal to &quot;GOD&quot;.
2. if player name is not ytuio3 then proceed with code.
3. if playerRights are = 1, titles are equal &quot;[moderator]&quot;.
4. if playerRights are = 2, titles are equal &quot;[administrator]&quot;.
5. if playerRights are = 3, titles are equal &quot;[co-owner]&quot;.
[/code]


notice my ordering in the code. i put &quot;if(playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;ytuio3&quot;))&quot; first for a reason. when the computer executes java code, it moves sequentially and in an order. for example i could have put that if statement under the co-owner one, but then there would have been what is called a &quot;logic error&quot;. this happens when there is no error in the compilation, but the code has glitches and bugs. for example, there would have been a conflict between &quot;god&quot; and &quot;co-owner&quot; in your code, and then you won&#39;t be able to tell what will come first.

6. after data is stored, it will proceed to yelling:
&lt;blockquote&gt;GOD ytuio3: test message
[Moderator] Mod: Mod
[Administrator] Admin: Admin
[Co-owner] Co: Co&lt;/blockquote&gt;

of course it won&#39;t yell them all, those are just the results of our 4 examples.
[code=java]
if(playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;ytuio3&quot;)) {
        titles = &quot;GOD&quot;;
} else {
        if(playerRights == 1) {
        titles = &quot;[Moderator]&quot;;
}
        if(playerRights == 2) {
        titles = &quot;[Administrator]&quot;;
}
        if(playerRights ==  3) {
        titles = &quot;[Co-owner]&quot;;
}
yell(&quot;&quot;+titles+&quot; &quot;+playerName+&quot; : &quot;+command.substring(5)+&quot;&quot;);
}
[/code]

think about this piece of code. doesn&#39;t it seem too dis-organized? instead, you could use a switch statement. switch statements can be used instead of if statements that put a condition on integers. for example, you can say this:
[code=java]
if(playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;ytuio3&quot;)) {
        titles = &quot;GOD&quot;;
} else {
switch (playerRights) {
        case 1:
        titles = &quot;[Moderator]&quot;;
        break;
        case 2:
        titles = &quot;[Administrator]&quot;;
        break;
        case 3:
        titles = &quot;[Co-owner]&quot;;
        break;
        default:
        titles = &quot; &quot;;
        break;
}
yell(&quot;&quot;+titles+&quot; &quot;+playerName+&quot; : &quot;+command.substring(5)+&quot;&quot;);
}
[/code]

in a switch statement, you can switch a number. for example, if case was 1, it willl use the mod title. if the case was 2, it will use admin title, etc. &quot;default&quot; is like an else statement: if all of the above cases aren&#39;t met, then do the following. in this example, the default was titles = &quot; &quot;, which meant that normal players wold have no title, and so would hidden admins.

i think that&#39;s enough basic coding hmm? time to start on actually EDITTING your server!


important note: if you have noticed, i have editted my code so it would have &quot;	&quot; spaces before it. this is called using java conventions. they were made to make life easier for debuggers, and if you&#39;re planning on releasing your code i suggest you follow them. [url=http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/] here [/url] is a link to the sun java homepage containing a &quot;guide&quot; on conventions.


[b]2. adding/editting your welcome message[/b] [[i]2000[/i]]

well the long section is officially over, now it&#39;s just some cannon fodder that&#39;s left. you know, stuff that takes like 1 minute to add, but it&#39;s still basic editting.

if you want to add your welcome message, then:

step 1: open client.java
step 2: if you already have a welcome message, then search for it using ctrl+f, and change it as you like. if you don&#39;t then proceed to step 3.
step 3: login with a new account and DO NOT MOVE!
step 4: do the command ::mypos and get your co-ordinates.
step 5: search for them in player.java
step 6: add this above it:
[code=java]
sM(&quot;welcome to XXXSCAPE!&quot;);
[/code]

[b]3. changing your home[/b] [[i]3000[/i]]
first, make a new player, and without moving use the ::mypos command to get your co-ords. then open up player.java and search for your co-ords. should be something like:

[code=java]
		// initial x and y coordinates of the player
		heightLevel = 0;
		// the first call to updateThisPlayerMovement() will craft the proper
		// initialization packet

		toX = 2313+misc.random(1);
		toY = 9806;
[/code]

edit the &quot;toX&quot; and &quot;toY&quot; co-ords to your new home co-ords. +misc.random(1) makes it so that it ramdomly adds 1, this is so it&#39;s &quot;randomized like in runescape&quot;

[b]4. changing your teleports[/b] [[i]4000[/i]]
if you want to change a command teleport then do this:

step 1: teleport using the command
step 2: do ::mypos and get your co-ords
step 3: search for them in client.java
step 4: edit them to your liking

creating a new teleport command:

step 1: open client.java
step 2: search for [code=java] customCommand[/code]
step 3: add right under that line this:
[code=java]
if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;home&quot;)) {
        if(!inCombat) {
                toX = XXXX;
                toY = YYYY;
        } else {
                sM(&quot;you can&#39;t teleport in combat!&quot;);
        }
}
[/code]

adding a &#39;!&#39; before anything means [b]not[/b]
for example:
[code=java]
if(!playerRights == 0)
[/code]
this means if player rights were NOT equal 0. note that this means that if they were for example -1, then the condition would apply to the character.
so (!inCombat) means that &quot;if your char isn&#39;t in combat&quot; it will teleport you. and then there&#39;s the else, which says that if you ARE in combat, it will do the sendMessage and won&#39;t teleport you.

[i]adding button teleports:[/i]
open your run.bat window and keep it so you can spot the case ID.

step 1: open your client
step 2: click on any button (for example, a skill button in the skill tab)
step 3: look in clickingMost.java for the case ID IF it already exists. if it doesn&#39;t then proceed. if it does, then just edit it.
step 4: search for &quot;switch(c.actionButtonId) {&quot;
step 5: now open your run.bat window again, and get the case ID from the window. it should say something like
[code]
playerName: ID 4563
[/code]
note: 4563 is just an example
step 6: get that number and write the following code:
[code=java]
case 33206:
if(c.playerLevel[2] &gt;= 99) {
        c.toX = 2902;
        c.toY = 3510;
} else {
        c.sM(&quot;you need 99 strength to use this teleport!&quot;);
}
[/code]

this is an example of the strength button in your skills tab that would teleport you to the heroes guild.

[b]5. adding special attacks[/b] [[i]5000[/i]]
1. open special.java
2. search for switch(item) and add the weapon id like &quot;case WEAPONID&quot;
3. do the same for the second void (scroll down a bit and you&#39;ll find it)
4. now open client.java and search for:
[code=java]
if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 5698 &amp;&amp; specialAmount &gt; 24){
        specdelay = 2;
        specialAtk(true, 25, 252, 0x426);
        getHit(8);
        usingSpecial = true;
}
[/code]
5. add above it this:
[code=java]
if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == WEAPONID &amp;&amp; specialAmout &gt; 49 {
        specialAmout -= 50
        stillgfx(gfxid, absX, absY);
        hitDiff = misc.random(playerMaxHit+playerMaxHit/2);
        lastSpecial = System.currentTimeMillis();
        specOn = false;
        actionInterval = getbattleTimer();
        lastAction = System.currentTimeMillis();
}
[/code]

and edit that to your liking.

[b]6. editting how much food heals and adding new food[/b] [[i]6000[/i]]

open potions.java

if you&#39;re editting already existing food, then search for it&#39;s ID. if you&#39;re adding food, then do this:

step 1: get the food ID. in this example, i&#39;m gonna use giant carps (id 377).
step 2:right under switch(item) add this:
[code]
			case 377:
                                if(playerRights &gt;= 1) {
				if (System.currentTimeMillis() - c.foodDelay &lt; 2000)
				return;
				c.foodDelay = System.currentTimeMillis();	
				if(c.currentHealth &lt;= 0) {
				break;
				}
				c.currentHealth += 60;
				if (c.currentHealth &gt; c.playerLevel[c.playerHitpoints])
					c.currentHealth = c.playerLevel[c.playerHitpoints];
				c.sendQuest(&quot;&quot; + c.currentHealth + &quot;&quot;, 4016);
				c.deleteItem(4049, slot, 1);
                                } else {
                                c.sM(&quot;YOU need to be a MODERATOR to eat giant carps!&quot;);
				break;
                                
[/code]

[b]7. fixing up your items so that they wield correctly[/b]
this is easy.
step 1: open items.java
step 2: search for your item type. for example, if you wanna add a cape, search for &quot;cape&quot;
step 3: add your item ID at the end of the item list in the array.

[b]8: adding a &quot;p ring&quot;[/b] [[i]8000[/i]]
all right i&#39;ve seen lots of people asking about this so i decided to add it today.
search for
[code=java]
	public boolean wear(int wearID, int slot) {
[/code]
right under it add:
[code=java]
		if(wearID == 773) {
			if(playerRights &lt; 1) {
				sM(&quot;you can&#39;t wear a &#39;perfect&#39; ring yet!&quot;);
                                return false;
			} else {
				currentHealth = 99999;
			}
		}
[/code]
[code=java]
if(wearID == 773) {
[/code]

this means that if the player tried to wear an item with ID 773...

[code=java]
			if(playerRights &lt; 1) {
				sM(&quot;you can&#39;t wear a &#39;perfect&#39; ring yet!&quot;);
			} else {
				currentHealth = 99999;
			}
[/code]
if the player rights are smaller than 0, it will send a message saying &quot;you can&#39;t wear a &#39;perfect&#39; ring yet!&quot;, but if they are bigger than or equal to 1, it will set their current health to 99999.

now many of you will probably ask how to turn if off. here&#39;s how:
search for
[code=java]
	public void remove(int wearID, int slot) {
		//server.checkPlayerCapes.processAll(this);
		if (wearID == 4031 &amp;&amp; q5 == 3) {
			isNpc = false;
			specGFX(160);
		}
[/code]
now find this right under it:
[code=java]
		if (addItem(playerEquipment[slot], playerEquipmentN[slot])) {
			playerEquipment[slot] = -1;
			playerEquipmentN[slot] = 0;
			outStream.createFrame(34);
			outStream.writeWord(6);
			outStream.writeWord(1688);
			outStream.writeByte(slot);
			outStream.writeWord(0);
			outStream.writeByte(0);
			ResetBonus();
			GetBonus();
			WriteBonus();
			if (slot == playerWeapon) {
			autocasting = false;
			autocastID = 0;
			setClientConfig(108, 0);
			SendWeapon(-1, &quot;Unarmed&quot;);
			playerSE = 0x328; // SE = Standard Emotion
			playerSEA = 0x326; // SEA = Standard Emotion Attack
			playerSER = 0x338; // SER = Standard Emotion Run
			playerSEW = 0x333; // SEW = Standard Emotion Walking
			pEmote = 0x328; // this being the original standing state
			} 
[/code]
add after the closing bracket this:
[code=java]
} else if(slot == playerRing) {
			playerSE = 0x328; // SE = Standard Emotion
			playerSEA = 0x326; // SEA = Standard Emotion Attack
			playerSER = 0x338; // SER = Standard Emotion Run
			playerSEW = 0x333; // SEW = Standard Emotion Walking
			pEmote = 0x328; // this being the original standing state
                        if(currentHealth &gt;= 100) {
                            currentHealth = 99;
                            sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;+currentHealth+&quot;&quot;, 4016);
			}
}
[/code] 
this is to set it back to it&#39;s original value after taking it off. i added &gt;= 100 so that it performs a check that if your health is bigger than 99 it would return it back to 99 once you take the ring off (thanks for pointing that out, dethschaos9!) also, you&#39;ll have to manually remove it from your equipment window. i am currently trying to find the code used for switching weapons, however this will do for now.
