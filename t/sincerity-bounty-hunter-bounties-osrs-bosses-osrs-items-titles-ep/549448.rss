The start of something huge is beginning to take its turn. We&#39;re edging more towards the state of PvP with slight skills and PvM incorporated to make the server benefit in various different ways. We&#39;ll be working on many different aspects of the server to perfect the game play, and give the community what they want. Enforcing PvP, with newer features, and custom work will ensure a enjoyable game play throughout our server. Many servers come and go, we&#39;ll be sticking around to revolutionize the PvP aspect of any private server. We&#39;re built to inspire, many will come, many will go. In the long run, the majority that stays will not regret it. 

Sincerity - the quality of being free from pretense, deceit, or hypocrisy.
Synonyms:  honesty, genuineness, truthfulness, integrity, probity, trustworthiness; 

What is an EloRating? Our Elo Rating system is a custom system, that classifies each player by ranking. The higher your rating, by earning kills, the better your skull gets. If you&#39;re a good pker, and dominating the wildy, your Elo Rating goes up, causing your skull to change colors. 

What&#39;s the aspect on our Elo Rating System? If you&#39;re a pker with a high Elo Rating, for example, if you&#39;re Elo Rating is 1500, and your opponents Elo Rating is 1000, and they kill you, they&#39;re Elo Rating will raise a lot more as they&#39;re killing someone of a higher ranking. And the user who died with the higher ranking, their Elo will drop a fair amount, and it&#39;s the same way around.

What&#39;s our Activity Point System? For every 40 minutes of in-game time you reach, you get an Activity Point, each point can be stacked and gained to save up for special items. You wont&#39; even realize you&#39;re gaining points when you&#39;re out Pk&#39;ing!
