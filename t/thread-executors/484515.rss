    <title>Thread executors</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/thread-executors/484515</link>
    <description>I started adding threads in my OOP project, but I have a question for this, I&#39;ve read the Java tutorials on thread and came with something that seems very easy to use: [url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/exinter.html]Executor Interfaces (The Java™ Tutorials &gt; Essential Classes &gt; Concurrency)[/url]

What I would like to know is: if I run a constant game tick, like Runescape does every 600ms, should I do with the (scheduleWithFixedDelay) or would it be bad to use it? It seems too easy and since I never worked with threads before, I would like feedback.</description>

              <p>Are you planning on using multiple threads in your project? Writing concurrent applications can be hard, especially for beginners. You can run into so many problems that are often hard to diagnose, this includes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">deadlocks</a>.</p>
<p>As for using a ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor as a loop, it all depends. You may want control over the loop, rather than a per-determined amount of time between each tick.</p>
