    <title>Help with RSC Landscape editor</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-rsc-landscape-editor/419553</link>
    <description>I just started using the landscape editor, and set up edgeville the way I would like it, then when I signed in, I noticed that it didn&#39;t actually delete the walls for the bank and all, but rather made then transparent, making it so I couldn&#39;t walk through them. How would I delete the walls completely? I&#39;ll post a short vid of what I mean.

              <p>[quote=“Kryptix, post:2, topic:419555”]The landscape file. It needs to know where the walls are because if it was only client-sided then the player could modify the client to walk through walls, over water, etc.</p>
<p>The landscape file must be updated within the server config AND the client config.[/quote]<br>
