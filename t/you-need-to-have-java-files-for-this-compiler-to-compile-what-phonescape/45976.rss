    <title>You need to have Java files for this Compiler to Compile. ? WHAT?!(Phonescape)</title>

    <description>Hi! I made my own server a couple of weeks ago, however, it sucked! So my friend sent me his server, which he doesn&#39;t use anymore, only one problem, when I open my compiler (The Perfect Compiler version 1.6), and try to run my server it says:

You do not have Server.class. Make sure that you have used the compiler with your server BEFORE you try runing it.

So I go to compile it, then it reads:

You need to have Java files for this Compiler to Compile.

How do I fix this? Thanks.</description>

              <p>Do you have Java development kit?</p>
<p>and do you have all the files necessary to run your server?</p>
<p>If not i suggest that you download a new source.</p>
