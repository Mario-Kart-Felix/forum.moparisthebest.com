              <p>A long time ago when I still had money on my account, I finished the Throne of Miscellania and Royal Trouble quests.</p>
<p>After that, I maxed my approval rating, sold my gear and invested some money in the coffers.<br>
I put as many servants as I could on flax, and the rest on maple logs.</p>
<p>I then left Runescape to come to Moparscape, going back to Runescape for a minute a day to keep my approval rating at 100%.</p>
<p>After what felt like 2 or 3 weeks, I had found that I had gone from 4 mil total to about 8 mil.</p>
<p>The prices of both flax and maple logs are currently low, but the seeds you get from the maple trees can sell for a lot if you’re lucky. At one point I had about 1.3 mil worth of seeds.</p>
<p>Note: You must have at least 750k in the coffers at all times to fully benefit from this.<br>
Since I had sold my armor, I always kept around 2 mil in them.</p>

<p>Well I have a few friends on rs who have made a lot of money in a few weeks without doing anything but waiting to buy or sell certain items in ge. One of my friends started out with a few hundred k and now has 100m+. So I know there are items that people merchant but I do not know of any. I have looked for some items but it takes way to long to sell them.</p>
