    <title>[pi] [317] [Need help with fally party room door!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-317-need-help-with-fally-party-room-door/526267</link>
    <description>I am trying to get in the party room so i can do a ::party command and it automatically teleports them there, but i cant seem to get in. :/

If someone could tell me how I could open the door, and make a ::party command that will tell the whole server &quot;There&#39;s a drop party hosted by (Name) At ::party &quot;

Please help me.

It&#39;s camelot party room btw.</description>

              <p>Why not just teleport them directly into the party zone?</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase("party")) {
	c.getPA().startTeleport(X, Y, Height, "modern");
}

if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase("hostparty") &amp;&amp; c.playerRights == 3) {
	for (int j = 0; j &lt; Server.playerHandler.players.length; j++) {
		if (Server.playerHandler.players[j] != null) {

			c2.sendMessage("There's a drop party hosted by " + c.playerName + " at ::party");
		}
	}
}</code></pre>
<p>First code teleports you to the party zone. You’ll need to add in the teleport int’s.</p>
<p>Second code sends a server messages saying “There’s a drop party hosted by (Name) at ::party”. You need to be rank 3 to use this command, since people would just spam the command. I’m not going to give you the code for a timer…</p>
<p>If there’s any problem with either one, just post here. I coded them in here.</p>
