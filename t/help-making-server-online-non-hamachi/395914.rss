    <title>Help Making Server Online Non-Hamachi</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-making-server-online-non-hamachi/395914</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve been trying to figure out how to make my server public without having to use Hamachi. I&#39;ve ran private servers for WoW so I know how to use either No-IP and DynDns and I&#39;ve also portforwarded.

I&#39;ve added a host and I&#39;ve downloaded No-IP but when I try to connect to my server, it gets stuck at, &quot;Connecting to Update Server&quot; and my CMD says &quot;error_game_js5connect&quot;.

So I tried going to my &quot;Host&quot; file in my drivers folder and I added this under everything.

127.0.0.1 *server name*
192.168.1.## *server name*
*External IP* *server name*

and I was able to connect but when I looked at my CMD, I only connected through 127.0.0.1 and 192.168.1.## and not my external IP. So then I tried just putting in my external IP and I couldn&#39;t connect.

When I worked on WoW private servers, I have to change the IP in the txt files, but I can&#39;t find anywhere to change it in the .java files in my source or client.

Any help??</description>
