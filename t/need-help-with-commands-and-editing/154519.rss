              <p>You don’t even need to compile when changing stats. Just change them in the .txt file then save and make sure you are logged out then log in and it should all be changed.</p>
<p>If you do exactly what “dog eats dog” said to do you will be fine.</p>

<p>Theres your master command, And to edit your stats do this.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"> Step 1 </span> - Go into character folder, And find your name.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"> Step 2 </span> - In your name you should see:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">[SKILLS]
character-skill = 0	99	14000000

character-skill = 24	1	0</code></pre>
<p>Thats an Example of what it looks like.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"> Step 3 </span> - Edit the bit that says : <code>99	14000000</code></p>
<p>14000000 is the EXP of the lvl and 99 is the level, Just simply change then to what you want.</p>
