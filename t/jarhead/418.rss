    <description>Its kinda old but i seen it. Its a great movie until the end. Which was crap. This guy goes into the army and he is on mission called desert shield. And they&#39;re fighting with saddam (me tink) and then it turns into operation desert storm. Then they started partying (i forgot why. i think because they thought they were going home) and one dude was cooking something (i think it was weenies) and he started a fire :eek:. Then the main guy (who is a 1337 sniper) and his friend (his spotter) was sent on a mission to take out 2 enemy generals. The enemy generals were in a tower and there was another tower next to it. They snuck into the other tower and he set up his sniper. They spotted the two enemies. He took aim. His spotter said &quot;your cleadr to take the shot when your ready&quot; . By this time sweat was going down his eyebrow, he wiped it off and prepared to fire. He started to squeeze the trigger and then one of his commanding officers came in and told him cease fire (or sumthing to make him stop). The commading officer called in an air-strike and the spotter guy was getting mad at the commading officer (cuz he wanted to shoot them enemies). The commading officer said NO i have my orders. And they were arguing and the spotter said &quot;Let us take the shot right when the artillery is coming&quot; and he wouldn&#39;t let them (What an ass). Then the air-strike ESPLODED the enimies. They were heading back to their camp (with their allies) and they heard gunfire (OH NOES!!!!) and they started running through the sand. They got to a high point (like a hill) and set up their sniper. They saw their allies shooting guns in the air and drinking. They asked why they were doing that and they said cuz they&#39;re going home (&#39;ts 1337 right?).Their allies asked if they got a kill and they sadly said no. And they went home. For me that was the gayest ending ever cuz they didn&#39;t even get to kill anyone~!~~~ What you guys think?

as you guys can guess i skipped all the crap that isn&#39;t nessesary (wrong spelling?)</description>

<p>This was more like a quick summary, a good summary though. The way you told it, made it sound like fun too. It also got pretty good reviews over at IMDB. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418763/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Jarhead Link</a></p>

<p>By all means do so. It was a while since i watched it. Cuz i downloaded it on bittorrent. But i think that ive put the most important parts in there. I left out a bunch of nonsense stuff like when they sent the video to the base of that one guys wife getting screwed by another man.</p>

              <p>The majority of the action you saw in the previews. I actually saw this when it was in theaters. Should have seen the ticket kids face when I demanded my money back.</p>

              <p>Its kinda old but i seen it. Its a great movie until the end. Which was crap. This guy goes into the army and he is on mission called desert shield. And they're fighting with saddam (me tink) and then it turns into operation desert storm. Then they started partying (i forgot why. i think because they thought they were going home) and one dude was cooking something (i think it was weenies) and he started a fire :eek:. Then the main guy (who is a 1337 sniper) and his friend (his spotter) was sent on a mission to take out 2 enemy generals. The enemy generals were in a tower and there was another tower next to it. They snuck into the other tower and he set up his sniper. They spotted the two enemies. He took aim. His spotter said "your cleadr to take the shot when your ready" . By this time sweat was going down his eyebrow, he wiped it off and prepared to fire. He started to squeeze the trigger and then one of his commanding officers came in and told him cease fire (or sumthing to make him stop). The commading officer called in an air-strike and the spotter guy was getting mad at the commading officer (cuz he wanted to shoot them enemies). The commading officer said NO i have my orders. And they were arguing and the spotter said "Let us take the shot right when the artillery is coming" and he wouldn't let them (What an ass). Then the air-strike ESPLODED the enimies. They were heading back to their camp (with their allies) and they heard gunfire (OH NOES!!!!) and they started running through the sand. They got to a high point (like a hill) and set up their sniper. They saw their allies shooting guns in the air and drinking. They asked why they were doing that and they said cuz they're going home ('ts 1337 right?).Their allies asked if they got a kill and they sadly said no. And they went home. For me that was the gayest ending ever cuz they didn't even get to kill anyone~!~~~ What you guys think?</p>

<p>as you guys can guess i skipped all the crap that isn't nessesary (wrong spelling?)</p>
