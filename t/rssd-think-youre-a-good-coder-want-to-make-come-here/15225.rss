    <title>[RSSD] Think you&#39;re a good coder? Want to make $? Come here!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rssd-think-youre-a-good-coder-want-to-make-come-here/15225</link>
    <description>I am in the middle of setting something up, and am calling all good coders (i.e. people I&#39;ve heard of) to join in.

[QUOTE]What is RPGW - RSSD?

RPGW - RSSD stands for: 

RPG World - RuneScape Server Development 

It is a small &#39;company&#39; started by me, in which I will code RuneScape Private Servers for an amount of $ or RS2 GP. 

The official site for this &#39;company&#39; is http://runescape.rpgw.org, which will have prices, order forms, contact details etc. 

The way it works: 
- You fill out an order form (if I can get it working) and I work out the cost. 
- I email you back the price it will be, and you &#39;Accept&#39; or &#39;Decline&#39;. 
- If you accept, I will begin working on the server, as you specify, and when done I will email you. 
- I will host the server for about 10 minutes for you, so you can see if you like it, and if so we will set up the payment. 
- Once payment is completed, I will host the server in a .rar file, in a secret link on the site. 
- You download the server, and once downloaded, I take it off so nobody else can get it. 

If you think you would like this, fill out the order form at http://runescape.rpgw.org, or if it isn&#39;t working, email me at: budda@rpgw.org.

Staff will get all the $/RS2 GP made from each client if they do the whole server themselves. Otherwise the $/RS2 GP made will be split evenly into whoever worked on the server.
