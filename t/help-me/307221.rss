    <description>I got a Dragon-History Server and Client and I&#39;m trying to:
Add in God Wars
Change The Starting Areas (Stupid Background)
Add a new player right (Root Admin)

Also it seems that no one can log in except me. There are logs of them logging in but it freezes up on them.</description>
