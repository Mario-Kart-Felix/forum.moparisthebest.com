    <description>OK,my server was working absolutley fine yesterday,but today,when I pressed &quot;R&quot; to run it,and enter.It took me to runserver and said, [glow=red,2,300]&quot;C:/documents and settings/alex/desktop/testscape_source/testscape source/runserver.bat is not a valid win32 application.&quot;[/glow]also,I got this [glow=red,2,300] You do not have a server class,Make sure that you have you have used the compiler with the server BEFORE you try running it.[/glow] 

But I didn&#39;t want to open runserver.All i wanted to do was clcik on compile once,press &quot;R&quot; and enter so it started up the server.Thats what I did yesterday,and it worked fine.

Oh and,there might be something important in here.

things I did before running the server this morning-

But I did that yesterday and it worked.Copyed and pasted phonchecks fight pits tut yesterday night into the compile.Copy+paste the codes in compile into run-server so it worked.(huge amount of codes).
The server is supposedly on HAM.I was running hamachi when i was on it.When i disabled hamachi it wouldin&#39;t work-so,yea,its a HAM server.[/glow]I also pressed,C,R,ENTER.To run it.=,Usualy i just do &quot;R&quot; and ENTER&quot;.

Basically When i press &quot;R&quot; to run the server and enter to run the server,( while i clicked on compile,one mouse click as I did before)(witch worked)it switched to runserver and didn&#39;t work.

SO-I need help on.

[glow=red,2,300]Running the server again.
stopping the thing switch to runserver from compile-thats probably why it wont run.
I need it to keep on compile for it to work.
Basically when i press r to run the server on &quot;compile&quot;it switches it to runserver.How do I stop this?
Also,It worked fine yesterday,but there are some errors today.
Was I supposed to copy+paste the stuff in compile into runserver???If im not thats probably a problem too.I did that because A little of the stuff I coded didn&#39;t work.So i thought it would work if i copyed+pasted into&quot;runserver&quot;[/glow]</description>
