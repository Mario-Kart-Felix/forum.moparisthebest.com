              <p>You can’t acess RuneScape from here. They effectively lock us out. What happens is when you put a number in the IP slot, the program looks up that IP and tries to find a server running on it. If there is no active server running on the IP, it returns that error message. If you want to find running servers, go to the <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,50.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">server advertisement section</a> for a list of currently running servers. Be sure to read the stickies first though.</p>

              <p>No its not possible,because all the commands and player controlling is server side,not client side.Even if you would be able to log in with modified client,which probably wont execute your injected commands,you can easilly get busted.</p>
