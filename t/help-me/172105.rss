    <description>Hi.
I cannot make a server for some reason, but...

I am asking for somebody to make me a server that i can edit and customize, or somebody to tell me exactly what to do from scratch since i cant make one myself. I have tried many time but i cannot get it working!

If somebody would like to make or tell me how to make a server properly i will make them co-owner if it works! =D

I know this sounds really nooby asking for this but my computer wont let me do it for some reason??
If you will do this for me just say and i will give you my email address so you can email me.

Thanks, Kratos00</description>

              <p>Ok, I am sorry but if you can’t get one set up on your own, you don’t need one. Also, for you to customize it you will need to understand java, else you will be posting here every single time you want to do something and asking for more help. And no one makes a server any more, they all edit pre existing servers.</p>
<p>So, what I recommend is learn a little bit about computers, they are not hard to figure out, and once you understand one fairly well, learn a language, start easy, html, then move up to css and javascript, then maybe python, then you can step up to java and it should be easy for you.</p>
