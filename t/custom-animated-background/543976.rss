    <title>Custom, animated background?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/custom-animated-background/543976</link>
    <description>How possible would it be for a client to contain a custom animated background. I&#39;d want my client to be converted from just loading a simple PNG image onto the clients login screen background to having a fully customized animated background.

Would this be possible? How hard would it be to do this?</description>
