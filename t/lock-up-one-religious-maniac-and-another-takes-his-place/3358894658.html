<p>What a waste of a mind. He is neither stupid nor crazy as some have said.</p>
<p>He’s like the professor of biochemistry Micheal Behe who believes in creationism, he’s not a stupid person but he uses his rational, intelligent mind to try to justify his dogmatic belief. It pains me to see his very capable mind being wasted away by this creationism.</p>
<p>I did something almost exactly like this when I believed in communism, using my rational intelligent (I hope) mind to justify communism and shit on capitalism.</p>

        <blockquote>If I were Obama, I wouldn't want to debate me either because I know that I would lose and would be advocating evil, murder, and immorality.  I know popularity means EVERYTHING to Obama, and Obama has no morals.  Obama doesn't want to say anything that is unpopular.  The simple and plain fact is this: He is nasty.  A shower is insufficient to clean him.  God needs to spiritually clean him internally with the blood of Jesus Christ which was shed at Calvary, fill Obama with the Holy Spirit, fill Obama with the Word Jesus Christ, fill Obama with the love of God and the love of Christ, fill Obama with humility to admit that he is wrong, and humble Obama.  Obama is supremely unclean--the most unclean man I can think of.  The very fact that he didn't even respond shows that he doesn't care much about his reputation.  Otherwise, he would be repulsed and disgusted by the very thought of any abortion of any child at any age.  He is afraid to debate me on this issue because he knows it will make him very unpopular.  I am supremely superior to Obama.  I'm like Lennox Lewis, and he's like Mike Tyson.  Mike Tyson is braver than Obama, because at least Mike Tyson agreed to fight Lennox Lewis.  Obama was too cowardly/scared/indifferent to even debate me.  How more civil can a challenge get than a public debate?  I was not asking Obama to box me.  It would have been mind war.  And my mind is superior to Obama's.  I am the undisputed world champion of the abortion debate.  Obama was too cowardly/scared/indifferent to even RESPOND!!!  Abortion is wrong in every single case, and for Obama to disagree with me is indisputable proof that he is wrong.  Obama is not even worthy to debate with me on the issue of abortion.

It is good to have humility and be humble.</p>

<a class="mention" href="../../u/yakman.html">@yakman</a>, this is far less religious and far more simply crazy person.  You can’t blame this one on religion.<br>

<p>I’m not sure you can claim he isn’t as religious. After all he presumably would say you weren’t properly religious either because you don’t want to stand up for ‘babies’.<br>
I don’t see how he isn’t a Christian like you when he worships the same Jesus, believes in the same God and derives his values from the same Bible.[/quote]</p>
<p>He certainly thinks he is religious.  I’m saying that he isn’t doing what any Christian religion in the world would advocate, unless maybe he tries to start his own.  Again, I’m against abortion because I think it is murder, but murdering people because they possibly may commit murder is not the solution, trying to convince them otherwise would be better.</p>
<p>But again, this isn’t a religious thing, it’s a crazy person thing.  If another atheist is a serial killer, and he is arrested and locked up, and then we find out about another, would it be fair for me to post a thread entitled “Lock up one atheist maniac and another takes his place!”, implying that you, as an atheist, are crazy as well?  I don’t think that would be fair.  Same case here.</p>

<p>In your example, there is an atheist who happens to be a serial killer, his atheism didn’t motivate his serial killing because its unlikely that an unbelief would tell you to do anything. But in the doctor-killer of this thread, his religion directly motivated his desire to kill doctors.</p>
<p>I appreciate that your religion doesn’t teach this and I’m sure it pains you when you see someone doing this in your religion’s name.</p>
<p>After eight murders, 17 attempted murders, 406 death threats, 179 assaults, and four kidnappings,[1][2] your pain must be very great seeing as your religion has been used to justify so many terrible acts.<br>
Why don’t you do something about it? Your religion is being hijacked and we all hear nothing about it, just this silence and quiet denouncement.</p>
<p>Anyone can turn on their television and see Bill O’Reilly, Glenn Beck, Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson and many other televangelists like the ones that converted the subject of this thread. You can watch them delivering touching rhetoric on abortion which clearly resonates with so many.</p>
<p>The pope as the leader of the Catholic church should be very concerned about his religion being hijacked to justify killing doctors. Does he say anything against it?<br>
No, he talks about how abortion is a crime against society[3], likens it to Holocaust[4] and says it is corrupting society[5]. You’d think that in these statements he’s at least mention that killing abortion doctors is wrong.</p>
<p>If religious leaders didn’t want abortion doctors to be killed yet saw tens or hundreds of their followers attempting to do so, wouldn’t they say something about it? Wouldn’t they mention that their religion was being misused?<br>
We hear nothing of that, we only hear about how terrible abortion is and that something must be done about it.</p>
<p>Do you understand why many in the pro-choice camp feel that you are liars?<br>
Many feel you are all pretending to be upset, issuing statements about how much they deplore violence, but it’s just bullshit. Many people feel that this is exactly what you wanted to happen.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Lothy, post:3, topic:335889”]I lol’d. What a retard. You know, it’s one thing to strongly believe in something, but it’s something else completely to force that view onto another.<br>
I like how he didn’t consider that the religious views of the patients and doctors might allow abortion.</p>
<p>Arrogant piece of shit.</p>
<p>EDIT: Typo.[/quote]</p>
<p>You sure? what if your beliefs tell you a black person should be a white mans slave or killing is part of nature and you have every right to kill anyone you like what about that.</p>
<p>There isn’t enough rules.</p>
<p>Like I am against abortion but not in the sense you may think I am against women actually having childern if they consider abortion then they should add some kind of a law if you abort your baby then your tubes must be tide forever so you will never be able to have another child sounds very fair in a sense of punishment it works both ways no more childern for you be happy because you aborted!.</p>
<p>I’ve seen this retarded girl who used to have sex in the males bathroom in school shes white but she had sex with a nigger everyday she got pregnant kept it private from her parents etc… then one day at school her baby was already ready she attempts to fix her problem so no one will ever know she was pregnant so she tries to pull her baby out in the bathroom which she does… and then attempts to flush it police came and defended this dumb girl and didn’t even care about the murder she did she should have her vagina stiched up in my opinion so she can only take it up the ass and feel pain everytime for what she died… some sins you do the retribution is really deserved and worth it.</p>
<p>If i was superman I’d force the government etc to do these laws or I’d take matters into my own hands and of course no one would be able to stop me…</p>
<p>Then again they got people who masterbate and kill sperm does that mean they should go to the sperm bank everytime they need to wack off? I don’t think so, even though its not the same thing because it’s only part of the baby but its still living things you are killing hack everyday you kill millions of skin cells by washing your face.</p>

I lol’d. What a retard. You know, it’s one thing to strongly believe in something, but it’s something else completely to force that view onto another.<br>
I like how he didn’t consider that the religious views of the patients and doctors might allow abortion.</p>
<p>Arrogant piece of shit.</p>
<p>EDIT: Typo.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>You sure? what if your beliefs tell you a black person should be a white mans slave or killing is part of nature and you have every right to kill anyone you like what about that.</p>
<p>There isn’t enough rules.</p>
<p>Like I am against abortion but not in the sense you may think I am against women actually having childern if they consider abortion then they should add some kind of a law if you abort your baby then your tubes must be tide forever so you will never be able to have another child sounds very fair in a sense of punishment it works both ways no more childern for you be happy because you aborted!.</p>
<p>I’ve seen this retarded girl who used to have sex in the males bathroom in school shes white but she had sex with a nigger everyday she got pregnant kept it private from her parents etc… then one day at school her baby was already ready she attempts to fix her problem so no one will ever know she was pregnant so she tries to pull her baby out in the bathroom which she does… and then attempts to flush it police came and defended this dumb girl and didn’t even care about the murder she did she should have her vagina stiched up in my opinion so she can only take it up the ass and feel pain everytime for what she died… some sins you do the retribution is really deserved and worth it.</p>
<p>If i was superman I’d force the government etc to do these laws or I’d take matters into my own hands and of course no one would be able to stop me…</p>
<p>Then again they got people who masterbate and kill sperm does that mean they should go to the sperm bank everytime they need to wack off? I don’t think so, even though its not the same thing because it’s only part of the baby but its still living things you are killing hack everyday you kill millions of skin cells by washing your face.[/quote]i hope for the fucking sake of humanity that this was a troll, else you should REALLY consider shutting the fuck up</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/yakman.html">@yakman</a>, this is far less religious and far more simply crazy person.  You can’t blame this one on religion.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m not sure you can claim he isn’t as religious. After all he presumably would say you weren’t properly religious either because you don’t want to stand up for ‘babies’.<br>
I don’t see how he isn’t a Christian like you when he worships the same Jesus, believes in the same God and derives his values from the same Bible.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>He certainly thinks he is religious.  I’m saying that he isn’t doing what any Christian religion in the world would advocate, unless maybe he tries to start his own.  Again, I’m against abortion because I think it is murder, but murdering people because they possibly may commit murder is not the solution, trying to convince them otherwise would be better.</p>
<p>But again, this isn’t a religious thing, it’s a crazy person thing.  If another atheist is a serial killer, and he is arrested and locked up, and then we find out about another, would it be fair for me to post a thread entitled “Lock up one atheist maniac and another takes his place!”, implying that you, as an atheist, are crazy as well?  I don’t think that would be fair.  Same case here.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>In your example, there is an atheist who happens to be a serial killer, his atheism didn’t motivate his serial killing because its unlikely that an unbelief would tell you to do anything. But in the doctor-killer of this thread, his religion directly motivated his desire to kill doctors.</p>
<p>I appreciate that your religion doesn’t teach this and I’m sure it pains you when you see someone doing this in your religion’s name.</p>
<p>After eight murders, 17 attempted murders, 406 death threats, 179 assaults, and four kidnappings,[1][2] your pain must be very great seeing as your religion has been used to justify so many terrible acts.<br>
Why don’t you do something about it? Your religion is being hijacked and we all hear nothing about it, just this silence and quiet denouncement.</p>
<p>Anyone can turn on their television and see Bill O’Reilly, Glenn Beck, Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson and many other televangelists like the ones that converted the subject of this thread. You can watch them delivering touching rhetoric on abortion which clearly resonates with so many.</p>
<p>The pope as the leader of the Catholic church should be very concerned about his religion being hijacked to justify killing doctors. Does he say anything against it?<br>
No, he talks about how abortion is a crime against society[3], likens it to Holocaust[4] and says it is corrupting society[5]. You’d think that in these statements he’s at least mention that killing abortion doctors is wrong.</p>
<p>If religious leaders didn’t want abortion doctors to be killed yet saw tens or hundreds of their followers attempting to do so, wouldn’t they say something about it? Wouldn’t they mention that their religion was being misused?<br>
We hear nothing of that, we only hear about how terrible abortion is and that something must be done about it.</p>
<p>Do you understand why many in the pro-choice camp feel that you are liars?<br>
Many feel you are all pretending to be upset, issuing statements about how much they deplore violence, but it’s just bullshit. Many people feel that this is exactly what you wanted to happen.</p>
