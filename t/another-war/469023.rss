Surprises me that nobody brought this up yet.
Are we humans proving ourselves again? Yes we are.

Thoughts?


Some recent facts.
- Within the next hours theres a UN meeting.
- 75k Israeli ground troops have been mobilized.
- Egypt and Iron support Palestine, egypt is debating intern to send support.
- Constant air strikes on gaza by israel (reported from inside, every 5 seconds.)
- A bunch of Palestinian rocket depots destroyed.

<p>Sorry, I didn’t mean to mislead anyone but I’m not a member of the armed forces. I have experience in warzones through the company my father works for, due to the nature of his work he is classed as ISAF personnel. I also have a card verifying me to any and all NDS/QRF restricted areas. More or less two-sided. We have the ISAF arm patch and inside it we keep the NDS/QRF card.</p>

<p>Just because they’re in the armed forces doesn’t outweigh the fact that they aren’t out there right now. They won’t know much more than the average member of society. I’m not 100% clear on the US armed forces however the British armed forces I do know that If you are stationed in a barracks you know very little more than the average member of society of what’s actually happening.</p>

              <p>Chill with the American hate posts guys. Only idiots watch the news channels and we aren’t all retarded.I, first of all, am only a teenager and am smart enough to realize this. I know what’s going on over there, and I support Israel. Don’t tell me I don’t know what I’m talking about either because I’ve done my research, heard word of mouth, am smart enough to discern fact from fake as supported by my near perfect GPA, and I’ve been in my school’s ROTC program for two years. Also, it was the palistinians who launched the first “attack” in this skirmish. It’s not quite a war yet. Also, Egypt isn’t going full force behind anybody yet, they were looking for their president, who has “pull” with Hamas to do a peace negotiation as a mediator, and that was put down by civilian unrest last I heard. Also, I think Israel is fu**ed up in their own sense as much as any other country, but do we really need to talk about muslim extremists and the impact they’ve had on this world? I think religion, as stated in a previous topic, is the center of half this world’s problems. The battle is being fought over their ancient religious gobbly-do-gook about this-land-is-my-land-this-land-is-your-land bullshit. Anyway, Israel is simply defending itself. The whole middle east is in turmoil for the most part and the Israelies rarely start conflict as much as the defend against it. Was it not only a few months ago in which Iran bluntly stated the would blow Israel off the map once their nuclear program took off? Anyway, back on topic with the current fight, I think Israel is justified in what they are doing. If somebody came at you with a knife trying to kill you, would you disarm them and say “stop”? No, you would harm them or kill them to prevent the future threat or make a point about what would happen if it was tried again.</p>

Welcome to MoparScape, the home of war experts.</p>
<p>Literally none of you know what you’re talking about.<br>
[/quote]and I suppose you think you do? LOL[/quote]<br>
Unlike almost all of you I’ve been in several war situations and been involved on both sides, as I said to Bowser; not in this war in question here but in Afghanistan. Everything you’ve said in the past about the Afghan war shows me you know nothing but wives tales. I’m sorry you lost a friend over there but that barely scratches the surface on what I’ve seen. You don’t base what you talk about on hard fact, you base it on stories that you’ve heard.</p>
