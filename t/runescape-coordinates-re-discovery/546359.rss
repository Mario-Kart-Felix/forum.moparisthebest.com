    <title>RuneScape Coordinates (Re-discovery)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-coordinates-re-discovery/546359</link>
    <description>Well I haven&#39;t been on Mopar in YEARS, but I just remembered of an old discovery I made in 2010...

I know most (experienced) RSPS coders probablly know this, but when using the &#39;X-grid&#39; and &#39;Y-grid&#39; coordinates, there&#39;s sort of a pattern... Usually, in MOST cases, the &#39;Y-Coordinate&#39; is usually the only coordinate to change, when say, you go into dungeons (or just basically underground anywhere) on the map. Sometimes of course the &#39;X-Coordinate&#39; will change a slight bit by maybe 5 or 10, but there&#39;s usually no SIGNIFICANT difference.

Anyway...Say you&#39;re standing in the kitchen in Lumbridge castle, and you want to be able to code the ladder so can propperly climb down into the basement of the castle, except you&#39;ve got a problem! You have NO idea what the basement&#39;s coordinates are! Well this is how I made my discovery... I just simply started to GUESS at the coordinates until eventually I stumbled across a pattern...

It seemed that everytime I wanted to go BELOW ground level (Lumbridge basement for example) that I discovered that the &#39;Y-Coordinate&#39; (in MOST cases) would have to be increased by +6400 from what it currently is. SO...If I&#39;m standing in Lumbridge kitchen and wanted to descend into the basement, I would just leave my current &#39;X-Coordinate&#39; the way it is, and add an ADDITIONAL +6400 to my current &#39;Y-Coordinatte&#39; as well.

I have NO idea what Lumbridge&#39;s Kitchen Coordinates, but let&#39;s just say they are 3200, 3200 (as an example). Just simply change it to 3200, 9800 and you will be in the basement! It&#39;s so crazy how I discovered this...

Just remember though, sometimes the &#39;X-Coordinate&#39; will need to be adjusted sometimes by 5, 10 or even 20. And also remember that this works for MOST areas that you want to descend into the lower depths of, but not ALL areas.


I hope you guys find this useful because I know I did.</description>
