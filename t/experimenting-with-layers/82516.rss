    <title>Experimenting with layers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/experimenting-with-layers/82516</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve just finished my new homepage and i&#39;m pretty pleased with the outcome, the method I used was pretty simple, but I think it came out pretty good, all I did was get a few images, put is as a &#39;lower layer&#39; in the psd, and then used a circular eraser to make holes in the &#39;main&#39; layer. :D

I was also pretty pleased with my logo at the top, I can&#39;t remember how I did it, I think it was something to do with the blending effects I used on the font, and I accidently added the logo on the same layer &gt;_&lt;

Anyway yeah ^_^
