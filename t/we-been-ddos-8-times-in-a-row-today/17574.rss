    <description>Amazing how RaW won&#39;t give up.
Im just amazed that only Sythe out of all the RS2 Cheating Communities has reported it to the police. I mean comon people if you don&#39;t want RaW to DDOS cheating sites anymore, we have to report it to the proper authorities. 

Post your oppinions here.</description>

              <p>[quote=“The Hateful Noob, post:73, topic:17574”]what does DDOS stand for?[/quote]Distributed attack</p>
<p>A distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) occurs when multiple compromised systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually a web server(s). These systems are compromised by attackers using a variety of methods.</p>
<p>Malware can carry DDoS attack mechanisms; one of the more well known examples of this was MyDoom. Its DoS mechanism was triggered on a specific date and time. This type of DDoS involved hardcoding the target IP address prior to release of the malware and no further interaction was necessary to launch the attack.</p>
<p>A system may also be compromised with a trojan, allowing the attacker to download a zombie agent (or the trojan may contain one). Attackers can also break into systems using automated tools that exploit flaws in programs that listen for connections from remote hosts. This scenario primarily concerns systems acting as servers on the web.</p>
<p>Stacheldraht is a classic example of a DDoS tool. It utilizes a layered structure where the attacker uses a client program to connect to handlers which are compromised systems that issue commands to the zombie agents which in turn facilitate the DDoS attack. Agents are compromised via the handlers by the attacker using automated routines to exploit vulnerabilities in programs that accept remote connections running on the targeted remote hosts. Each handler can control up to a thousand agents.[1]</p>
<p>These collections of compromised systems are known as botnets, DDoS tools like stacheldraht still use classic DoS attack methods centered around ip spoofing and amplification like smurf and fraggle attacks (these are also known as bandwidth consumption attacks), SYN floods (also known as resource starvation attacks) may also be used. Newer tools can use DNS servers for DoS purposes. (see next section)</p>
<p>Unlike MyDooms DDoS mechanism botnets can be turned against any ip address. Script kiddies use them to deny the availability of well known websites to legitimate users.[2] More sophisticated attackers will use DDoS tools for the purposes of extortion and even against their business rivals.[3]</p>
<p>It is important to note the difference between a DDoS and DoS attack. If an attacker mounts a smurf attack from a single host it would be classed as a DoS attack. In fact any attack against availability e.g. using High-energy radio-frequency weapons to render computer equipment inoperable would be classed as a Denial of Service attack albeit an exotic one.[4] On the other hand if an attacker uses a thousand zombie systems to simultaneously launch smurf attacks against a remote host this would be classed as a DDoS attack.</p>
