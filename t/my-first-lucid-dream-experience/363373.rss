    <title>My first lucid dream experience</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-first-lucid-dream-experience/363373</link>
    <description>It was probably one of the best physcological experiences I&#39;ve ever had next to drugs. I&#39;m not really sure how it came about, but I had a really late night before and had about 3 hours sleep. went to a lecture, came back and then napped. I instantly went lucid, more or less as soon as I closed my eyes. 

I can&#39;t really remember how it started off, but I appeared in a huge off house where some kids were trying to put some weird liquid mix in to my mouth, saying that it&#39;s a good drug. So I took some and everything just went mad from then on in. I wish I could explain. Next time i have one, I&#39;m writing shit down as soon as I wake. At times I was so worried that it wasn&#39;t a dream and this was actually happening. I kept asking random people to punch my arm, and I couldn&#39;t feel anything so I just kept saying to myself &quot;I&#39;m dreaming&quot;. At times though, it did become a bit scary because I thought I couldnt wake myself up. I kept trying to smash my fist through some glass to see if I could feel the pain. At one point I got the opportunity to jump off a roof, but I pussied out as I thought I&#39;d probably die. 

There was one really vivid part, where I had complete control and the colours and the feelings and everything about the moment seemed to be so fucking incredibly real. I also tried my hardest to see if I could fuck a girl (cmon, gotta give it a go). At one point I got myself in the bed with one, but then lost the concentration and my mind went elsewhere. 

Towards the end, it got to the point where I just wanted to wake up, and I remember thinking how the fuck am I gonna do it, but then I looked at a sign, cant remember what it said, and I instantly woke up. 

Anyone got any new experiences with lucid dreaming and whether you could give me some tips to have more control? 

Also, if your shouting in the dream is it possible you could be shouting out loud? And does having a hangover improve chances of lucid dreaming? I was severely hungover from a pretty heavy night, and feel that might of been the reson for not even having to try to go lucid.</description>

              <p>It was probably one of the best physcological experiences I’ve ever had next to drugs. I’m not really sure how it came about, but I had a really late night before and had about 3 hours sleep. went to a lecture, came back and then napped. I instantly went lucid, more or less as soon as I closed my eyes.</p>
<p>I can’t really remember how it started off, but I appeared in a huge off house where some kids were trying to put some weird liquid mix in to my mouth, saying that it’s a good drug. So I took some and everything just went mad from then on in. I wish I could explain. Next time i have one, I’m writing shit down as soon as I wake. At times I was so worried that it wasn’t a dream and this was actually happening. I kept asking random people to punch my arm, and I couldn’t feel anything so I just kept saying to myself “I’m dreaming”. At times though, it did become a bit scary because I thought I couldnt wake myself up. I kept trying to smash my fist through some glass to see if I could feel the pain. At one point I got the opportunity to jump off a roof, but I pussied out as I thought I’d probably die.</p>
<p>There was one really vivid part, where I had complete control and the colours and the feelings and everything about the moment seemed to be so fucking incredibly real. I also tried my hardest to see if I could fuck a girl (cmon, gotta give it a go). At one point I got myself in the bed with one, but then lost the concentration and my mind went elsewhere.</p>
<p>Towards the end, it got to the point where I just wanted to wake up, and I remember thinking how the fuck am I gonna do it, but then I looked at a sign, cant remember what it said, and I instantly woke up.</p>
<p>Anyone got any new experiences with lucid dreaming and whether you could give me some tips to have more control?</p>
<p>Also, if your shouting in the dream is it possible you could be shouting out loud? And does having a hangover improve chances of lucid dreaming? I was severely hungover from a pretty heavy night, and feel that might of been the reson for not even having to try to go lucid.</p>
