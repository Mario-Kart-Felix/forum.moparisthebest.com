        <p>It was probably one of the best physcological experiences I’ve ever had next to drugs. I’m not really sure how it came about, but I had a really late night before and had about 3 hours sleep. went to a lecture, came back and then napped. I instantly went lucid, more or less as soon as I closed my eyes.</p>
<p>I can’t really remember how it started off, but I appeared in a huge off house where some kids were trying to put some weird liquid mix in to my mouth, saying that it’s a good drug. So I took some and everything just went mad from then on in. I wish I could explain. Next time i have one, I’m writing shit down as soon as I wake. At times I was so worried that it wasn’t a dream and this was actually happening. I kept asking random people to punch my arm, and I couldn’t feel anything so I just kept saying to myself “I’m dreaming”. At times though, it did become a bit scary because I thought I couldnt wake myself up. I kept trying to smash my fist through some glass to see if I could feel the pain. At one point I got the opportunity to jump off a roof, but I pussied out as I thought I’d probably die.</p>
<p>There was one really vivid part, where I had complete control and the colours and the feelings and everything about the moment seemed to be so fucking incredibly real. I also tried my hardest to see if I could fuck a girl (cmon, gotta give it a go). At one point I got myself in the bed with one, but then lost the concentration and my mind went elsewhere.</p>
<p>Towards the end, it got to the point where I just wanted to wake up, and I remember thinking how the fuck am I gonna do it, but then I looked at a sign, cant remember what it said, and I instantly woke up.</p>
<p>Anyone got any new experiences with lucid dreaming and whether you could give me some tips to have more control?</p>
<p>Also, if your shouting in the dream is it possible you could be shouting out loud? And does having a hangover improve chances of lucid dreaming? I was severely hungover from a pretty heavy night, and feel that might of been the reson for not even having to try to go lucid.</p>

        <p>I had one several months ago. As soon as I realized it was lucid I thought “naked woman” - Instantly appeared…I was sitting there after thinking what else can I do with this dream.

<p>I finally woke, got up and went to my door completely freaked out. Opened the door then felt this eery feeling. I couldn’t believe it but I pinched myself and felt nothing. I panicked again, screaming to wake up hitting myself several times in the face before I woke up again.</p>
<p>Walked to my door, into the kitchen and drank a glass of water. I then froze, I realized I couldn’t feel the glass in my hand…panicked again.</p>
<p>Finally woke up for real. Was the most scared I have been in my life (i’m 21 years old). I didn’t sleep, I was too scared to so I just stayed up till day time…</p>

Does it really upset you that much? Ollie posted it here, it was relevant. Go find something worthy to bitch about.</p>
