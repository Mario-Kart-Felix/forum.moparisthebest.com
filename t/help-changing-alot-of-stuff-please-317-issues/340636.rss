    <description>I have the paradise source, ive changed so much already but ive ran into major issues. How do i change the animation and gfx of veng, everytime i use veng its still a white skull and i have put a red skull model and correct id in the client and still will not work, how do i put the new ags gfx and animation in because ive tried changing the gfx and no luck. Willing to pay for help because im tired of spending endless hours trying, if your willing to give free help ty so much. its a 317 server. also there is a dupe which people say has something to do with clan chat? does this ring a bell cause nobody will tell me. thanks</description>
