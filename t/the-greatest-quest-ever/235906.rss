    <description>[center][font=Batik Regular][size=20pt]The Quest of Great Heros[/size] [/font][/center]

[font=Bradley Hand Itc][b][size=12pt]

[i]Intro (This is the boring part) : [/i]
     Hey, I got muted for trying to host projects so I got bored and created a quest for 474&#39;s. The quest&#39;s name is &quot;The Quest of Great Heros&quot;... The way it got this name is, I have Ancient World History as one of my classes and we were going over some of the creation myths and other stuff like that, and we are currently going over Sparta. I was thinking, what if I made a quest that followed along with these creation myths? Then as I headed to sixth period (my english period) my teacher showed us the story of Gilgamesh. So I decided I wouldn&#39;t do a quest over creation myths, but over what my teacher had been talking about for a while, something called the Monomyth Cycle. For those of you that don&#39;t know what that is, it&#39;s the cycle that every religion, every race, every minority&#39;s story is based apon (sort of). Its the cycle by which every myth follows. So what we were talking was perfect for a RuneScape style quest. Then during the process of making the quest we started going over Beowulf. So I decided to add a Beowulf story in the quest as well... 

[i]What the quest is about:[/i]

     So, what is the quest about? Well this quest is basically a mixture between Gilgamesh, Beowulf, and my imagination. The quest follows in a pretty good order and it is very challenging I might add...

Here&#39;s how the story goes

-You start off talking to the Wise Old Man, now the Wise Old Man on my server isn&#39;t like the RuneScape Wise Old Man. The MimzScape Wise Old Man is a nice person, kind of like the steriotypical old guy that lives down the street who is friendly and has so many stories to tell you you almost want to kill yourself. Well anyway, the Wise Old Man speaks of a treasure greater than anything in the whole world. The treasure is the gift of immortality (Gilgamesh Reference). So your trying to find immortality.

-You have to (Monomyth Cycle Reference -&gt;) pass through the &quot;spirit world&quot;. In order to do this, you have to find a special ring and return it to the Wise Old Man so that he can use it to transport you into the Spirit World (aka. heightLevel = 4)

-Here you will be teleported to the ::home area, but you will notice that there aren&#39;t any NPC&#39;s anymore, but everything looks the same. However you see the Ice Queen. You go talk to her and she tells you of the tasks that you must accompish
               -You must slay the Dark Beast (Gilgamesh Reference)
               -You must slay a Greater Demon (Beowulf Reference)
               -You then must kill the greatest beast of them all... the King Black Dragon (King Arthur Reference)
               -You must obtain the secret key

-Once you have the secret key, you open the chest that you find laying on the ground behind the King Black Dragon. Once the chest is unlocked you see that there are only ashes left in the chest. So you head back to the Ice Queen and tell her what happened. She says that the treasure has been moved. You then are teleported to a boat (Gilgamesh Reference) and you have to get a rope and then climb off of the boat and into the water. Then you swim around in the water until you find a flower (Gilgamesh Reference). Once you have the flower, you bring it back up and give it to the Ice Queen. 

-So now you have beaten the quest... But what are the rewards? Well you get full initiate (with added strength, attack, defence etc. bonuses on them). Also you get a ring of life (which when rubbed boosts your health to 500! Too bad you only have 5 rubs... only) plus 5mil. Now you might think that thats a little too much for a quest, but actually the quest is REALLY REALLY hard. All of the Npc&#39;s health have been boosted up buy 250 hp... Only the best of the best can complete this quest. 

[i]Conclusion:[/i]

So, hopefully you&#39;re interested in this... The only bad thing is, I&#39;m not completly done with this. There are still a few things that I have to finish and fix up before it will be completly done... So this is just what I have so far but the only things I need to fix are

-Npc&#39;s Health
-Rewards
-The Ring of Life
-My home location (it&#39;s not big enough...)
-Npc talking (it works correctly sort of, but theres a glitch where it ends up teleporting you too early in the text...)
-I have 100 errors as of today (but I can easily fix that)



Sooo... Yeah thats just what I&#39;ve been doing and I just thought I&#39;d release that and show off what I&#39;ve been doing whilst I was gone... 

Thanks for reading,

<p><span class="bbcode-i">Intro (This is the boring part) : </span><br>
Hey, I got muted for trying to host projects so I got bored and created a quest for 474’s. The quest’s name is “The Quest of Great Heros”… The way it got this name is, I have Ancient World History as one of my classes and we were going over some of the creation myths and other stuff like that, and we are currently going over Sparta. I was thinking, what if I made a quest that followed along with these creation myths? Then as I headed to sixth period (my english period) my teacher showed us the story of Gilgamesh. So I decided I wouldn’t do a quest over creation myths, but over what my teacher had been talking about for a while, something called the Monomyth Cycle. For those of you that don’t know what that is, it’s the cycle that every religion, every race, every minority’s story is based apon (sort of). Its the cycle by which every myth follows. So what we were talking was perfect for a RuneScape style quest. Then during the process of making the quest we started going over Beowulf. So I decided to add a Beowulf story in the quest as well…</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">What the quest is about:</span></p>
<pre><code> So, what is the quest about? Well this quest is basically a mixture between Gilgamesh, Beowulf, and my imagination. The quest follows in a pretty good order and it is very challenging I might add...
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s how the story goes</p>
<p>-You start off talking to the Wise Old Man, now the Wise Old Man on my server isn’t like the RuneScape Wise Old Man. The MimzScape Wise Old Man is a nice person, kind of like the steriotypical old guy that lives down the street who is friendly and has so many stories to tell you you almost want to kill yourself. Well anyway, the Wise Old Man speaks of a treasure greater than anything in the whole world. The treasure is the gift of immortality (Gilgamesh Reference). So your trying to find immortality.</p>
<p>-You have to (Monomyth Cycle Reference -&gt;) pass through the “spirit world”. In order to do this, you have to find a special ring and return it to the Wise Old Man so that he can use it to transport you into the Spirit World (aka. heightLevel = 4)</p>
<p>-Here you will be teleported to the ::home area, but you will notice that there aren’t any NPC’s anymore, but everything looks the same. However you see the Ice Queen. You go talk to her and she tells you of the tasks that you must accompish<br>
-You must slay the Dark Beast (Gilgamesh Reference)<br>
-You must slay a Greater Demon (Beowulf Reference)<br>
-You then must kill the greatest beast of them all… the King Black Dragon (King Arthur Reference)<br>
-You must obtain the secret key</p>
<p>-Once you have the secret key, you open the chest that you find laying on the ground behind the King Black Dragon. Once the chest is unlocked you see that there are only ashes left in the chest. So you head back to the Ice Queen and tell her what happened. She says that the treasure has been moved. You then are teleported to a boat (Gilgamesh Reference) and you have to get a rope and then climb off of the boat and into the water. Then you swim around in the water until you find a flower (Gilgamesh Reference). Once you have the flower, you bring it back up and give it to the Ice Queen.</p>
<p>-So now you have beaten the quest… But what are the rewards? Well you get full initiate (with added strength, attack, defence etc. bonuses on them). Also you get a ring of life (which when rubbed boosts your health to 500! Too bad you only have 5 rubs… only) plus 5mil. Now you might think that thats a little too much for a quest, but actually the quest is REALLY REALLY hard. All of the Npc’s health have been boosted up buy 250 hp… Only the best of the best can complete this quest.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Conclusion:</span></p>
<p>So, hopefully you’re interested in this… The only bad thing is, I’m not completly done with this. There are still a few things that I have to finish and fix up before it will be completly done… So this is just what I have so far but the only things I need to fix are</p>
<p>-Npc’s Health<br>
-Rewards<br>
-The Ring of Life<br>
-My home location (it’s not big enough…)<br>
-Npc talking (it works correctly sort of, but theres a glitch where it ends up teleporting you too early in the text…)<br>
-I have 100 errors as of today (but I can easily fix that)</p>
<p>Sooo… Yeah thats just what I’ve been doing and I just thought I’d release that and show off what I’ve been doing whilst I was gone…</p>
<p>Thanks for reading,<br>
