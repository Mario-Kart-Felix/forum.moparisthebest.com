Archaios is a new server that has just reached the end of its coding, Archaios has many features that some other servers may not have.  Archaios a new fully coded 724 RSPS looking for new members ready to play a skilling/economy server.

Archaios is run by mainly two people Luke &amp; Evan They are the two main Developers of this server, they take their job very seriously and are always trying to make Archaios better.

Archaios is a new server so yes we are on the lookout for staff, but this gives no one the right to beg for a spot on the Archaios staff team, matter of fact this would lower your chances of getting on the staff team.

Archaios has almost every skill working and is a very fun server, we will have many events and rare item give-aways to start off the server and see where it goes from there.  We also have Fully Working Dicing

At the moment this is the Archaios Staff:

Developers:

Luke &amp; Evan

Administrators:

None

Moderators:

Alpha

We hope to see you online soon.
