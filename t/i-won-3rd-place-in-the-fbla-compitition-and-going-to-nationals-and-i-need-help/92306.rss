    <description>I won 3rd place in a convention against many other students in &quot;Intro to Technology Concepts.&quot;

[code]If yo do not care, do not post.[/code]

I am going to the national competition, in Chicago.  However, I need you help(for people that use databases)
I went with about 9 questions about a database that starts with h, has the letters: h, e, i, y, c. 
That is all I can remember, they had weird questions about it that I did not know the answers to, please help me.</description>

              <p>I really don’t understand what you’re asking regarding databases.  Do you mean that there was a specific term about databases containing those letters that you didn’t recognize?</p>
