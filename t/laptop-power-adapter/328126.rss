    <title>Laptop Power Adapter</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/laptop-power-adapter/328126</link>
    <description>So I was in class and I had my laptop (Gateway M7315U) plugged in like normal. Screen dimmed down and it said it wasn&#39;t charging.

Power adapter light was off. Came back on and flickered a few times for the next 30 seconds, and then it completely turned off.

Unplugged it for a few hours. I&#39;ve tried plugging it into multiple outlets and the light won&#39;t turn on anymore and it&#39;s not charging my laptop.

So I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s dead? I&#39;m looking to buy a new one, but it&#39;s SO confusing. Gateway linked me to a retailer of their power adapters.

Picked my model and it gives me two options:

http://www.skyline-eng.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=product.display&amp;Product_ID=5716
http://www.skyline-eng.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=product.display&amp;Product_ID=4823

The 90W one looks exactly like the one I have now, but it says MAKE SURE the Voltage and Amps are the same as your current one. Laptop itself says input: 19V 3.42A. So does the adapter. The 90W one is 19V and 4.74A.

So I goto the 65W one. It has the same 19V 3.42A, but looks different. It only has two prongs.

Both of these I can get for ~$40.

I&#39;ve found JUST the part that connects to the laptop, but I&#39;m not sure if my power cable or the part that connects is broke. I&#39;ve found them pretty cheap too, ~$10, but most reviews have said they&#39;re all crap.

So, do I get the one that looks like mine but has more Amps, or the one that has the correct Amps but MIGHT be for my model.

Every other site I&#39;ve been to, when I tell it I have a M7315U it links me to a 19V 4.74A supply. So then why does my laptop say 3.42A on the input?



EDIT:

http://gateway.shopbysystem.com/gateway-90w-replacement-power-adapter-2521997r.html

So that one came up on another search for my model number. It&#39;s 90W but says it replaces 65W model.

Also, I can&#39;t find my model number under the list of the models for the other two links, but I can on this one. But this one is considerably more.


EDIT2:

http://cgi.ebay.com/AC-Power-Adapter-for-Gateway-M-7309h-M-7315u-M-7305u_W0QQitemZ200434199661QQcmdZViewItemQQimsxZ20100131?IMSfp=TL100131173003r18355

This looks most like mine, and with the same specifications. My only concern is how cheap it is.

Same with this:
