Single and Dual core processors. 
- How do they work ? 
- What are the characteristics of each and what is the difference between them? 
- What is the best / most optimized environment for them to perform in?</description>

<p>A multi-core processor is a single computing component with two or more independent processing units called cores, which read and execute program instructions. The instructions are ordinary CPU instructions (such as add, move data, and branch) but the single processor can run multiple instructions on separate cores at the same time, increasing overall speed for programs amenable to parallel computing. Manufacturers typically integrate the cores onto a single integrated circuit die (known as A mul...</p>
