    <description>Hello again!

I want to trouble you with one problem - how to edit the background logo you see, when you try to login ?
That one:
[img]http://img379.imageshack.us/img379/2541/rscdhd1.png[/img]

And not the LOADING logo!


Thanks in advance!
Waiting for response.</description>

I’ll help people like they helped me if they ask a valid <span class="bbcode-b">RSC Server Development</span> question. But right now these threads have been answered a million times and they are not progressing any further except throwing another useless server out there for more players to split up into. By useless i mean a server where someone needs to ask for help for a simple thing, yeh its all fun and games to them except it’s wrecking the rsc world and right now it cant even be fixed.</p>
<p>Nobody here is willing to learn properly and give things a shot. Take a look at the last 100-200 threads on here and you will see that nobody has tried to do something java/development-wise and actually gave something a shot without requesting the entire thing done.[/quote]you didnt answer my question in pm and it was valid. nobody has ever asked it before, and it wasnt simple either but you ignored it anyways and didnt offer me any help whatsoever.</p>

<p>Anyway I’ve never used custom sprites or tried to make any of my own so im not sure where for you to look, but i’d assume its in the sprite files so you need to export/edit/repack and use the new sprite files (iirc that was how it was done)</p>

But right now these threads have been answered a million times and they are not progressing any further except throwing another useless server out there for more players to split up into. By useless i mean a server where someone needs to ask for help for a simple thing, yeh its all fun and games to them except it’s wrecking the rsc world and right now it cant even be fixed.</p>
<p>Nobody here is willing to learn properly and give things a shot. Take a look at the last 100-200 threads on here and you will see that nobody has tried to do something java/development-wise and actually gave something a shot without requesting the entire thing done.</p>

<p>So what is the problem then?</p>
<p>xEnt, true that this community is full of cocky newcomers and leechers, but maybe you could make some difference. Or, just make programs that people could use, then there would be some use of you. Otherwise, your skills are really going to waste if you don’t use them.</p>
