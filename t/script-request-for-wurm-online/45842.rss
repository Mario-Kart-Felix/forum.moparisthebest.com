    <title>Script Request for Wurm Online</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/script-request-for-wurm-online/45842</link>
    <description>There is a game i play alot called Wurm Online, it is an online fantasy Simulator wich has Teraforming and most items you create your self, Actions are done much like runscape, Right click Select Action, moving is done by the &#39;W&#39;, &#39;S&#39;, &#39;A&#39;, and &#39;D&#39; Keys, im trying to get my mining up on the game, but it it very dificult and time consuming, a normal mouse macro doesnt work because each tim you right click the menu pops up a few pixels to the right, left, or up, and down, i was thinking SCAR could probably work in this game since all actions are done by mouse, i have never been able to make a working SCAR script for runescape, or any other game for that matter and i was wondering if someone could make a mining script for me.

There site is http://www.wurmonline.com it is made in Java and has some damn good Graphics for a java game, you need a pretty good GFX card to run it tho, and atleast 528+MB of RAM.

Thanks, Cj</description>
