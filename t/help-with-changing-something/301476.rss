<p>The entire ban command might(but won’t) look like this</p>
<p><code>
if(command.equalsIgnoreCase("Ban") &amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt;= 2) {
String victim = command.substring(8);
PlayerHandler.kickNick = victim;
System.out.println("Admin:"+playerName+" is banning "+victim);
sendMessage("Player successfully banned.");
appendToBanned(victim);
BufferedWriter bw = null;
try {
bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("data/banlogs.txt", true));
bw.write(playerName+" banned"+victim);
bw.newLine();
bw.flush();
}</code><br>
(No, I’m not saying you should use that or it should look like that)</p>
