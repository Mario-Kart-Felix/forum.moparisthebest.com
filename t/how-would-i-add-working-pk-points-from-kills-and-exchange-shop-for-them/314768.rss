    <description>Well i&#39;ve seen all the new servers these days and they all seem to have pk points and a shop to exchange them in, and i was wondering if someone could teach/show me how to do this, if you can please post, idc if you dont wanna spoon feed me, but ill need to learn the basics and then i can catch on but atm i have no idea how to even do anything with it.</description>

              <p>ignore the idiots.</p>
<p>One thing you have to be very careful with on 317 is adding the things that edit the character files.<br>
Depending on your source there is probably something like a didkill didslay etc function. Youll have to look through your client.java for the pking/combat booleans.  Once you find them add a simple pkpoints += 1 like you did.<br>
If your looking for an example to go off of. pvp-evolution is an all pk server with a point exchange. Its delta. ( i think) you can just take the scripts out you need. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

Here’s what I did. In your main file, create an int Example: “PKpoint = 0”<br>
Then find your death method somewhere and for player two when they die add PKpoint = 1;<br>
that’s what I did. I know it’s explained bad.</p>
