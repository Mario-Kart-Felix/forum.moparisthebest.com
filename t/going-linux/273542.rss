    <title>Going Linux</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/going-linux/273542</link>
    <description>Been using windows since 95, fuckin know anything windows like the back of my hand, want a challenge in the computer world.

About a year ago i tried out linux for 10 minutes, downloaded OpenSuSe i think it was, installed it and it just didn&#39;t seem like i installed it right? (screen was half the size, couldent find where to change res)  bunch of other stuff.

People say i should start off with ubuntu, which i may do once i get uncapped so i can download it.

I will be using Linux for everything such as programming , music, irc, browsing etc. Except gaming (Trying to brighten my computer knowledge, nothing else i can learn more until i make the jump to linux)

Will be keeping XP as well for when i game.

Also is drivers and shit gonna be easy to set up? like, i got a mobo which only has windows drivers, how will i get all that shit to support with linux? same goes with video card, external hard drive, is there usb 2.0?</description>

You need to get used to the linux way of installing things.  You don’t google, download and install like on windows.  It is much easier, you simply open your package manager (on ubuntu, I think it comes with synaptic) and search and click install on whatever you want.  xchat is what I recommend for IRC, the best music player I’ve ever used is Amarok, and on all Operating Systems VLC is the way to go for video.</p>
<p>As to your video card, open the restricted driver manager and enable the nvidia drivers (that get’s you the proprietary driver from <a href="http://nvidia.com" rel="nofollow noopener">nvidia.com</a>) and in synaptic install the nvidia-xconfig or nvidia-settings and use that to adjust anything you want about your graphics card.</p>
<p>Any other questions, post here.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m a retard, so I use the root account on my computer. Which means I can’t use VLC right. I ended up getting smplayer for my computer, which seems to be a fairly decent player.[/quote]</p>
<p>Why would you do that?  Just make a real account and use it, running everything as root simply doesn’t make any sense.</p>

<p>XMMS is pretty much Winamp Classic, albeit slightly “buggy”, Amaorak is good from what I hear.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, there are easier ways of getting programs than using google(but it is an option, took me forever to find the mp3 plugin for XMMS on Fedora, and 5 mins or so on google and I found it).</p>

              <p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:11, topic:273542”]You need to get used to the linux way of installing things.  You don’t google, download and install like on windows.  It is much easier, you simply open your package manager (on ubuntu, I think it comes with synaptic) and search and click install on whatever you want.  xchat is what I recommend for IRC, the best music player I’ve ever used is Amarok, and on all Operating Systems VLC is the way to go for video.</p>
<p>As to your video card, open the restricted driver manager and enable the nvidia drivers (that get’s you the proprietary driver from <a href="http://nvidia.com" rel="nofollow noopener">nvidia.com</a>) and in synaptic install the nvidia-xconfig or nvidia-settings and use that to adjust anything you want about your graphics card.</p>
<p>Any other questions, post here.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m a retard, so I use the root account on my computer. Which means I can’t use VLC right. I ended up getting smplayer for my computer, which seems to be a fairly decent player.</p>

<p>Tell us what kind of hardware…Chances are it will just work (you may need to click a button to get hardware accelerated 3d graphics).

              <p>I’m still slowly making the switch from windows to linux (I’ve been using it since 95 too). I just installed ubuntu and xp as a dual boot and use either depending on what I’m doing.</p>
<p>It’s been harder to get drivers for linux and emulate the same sort of things XP has that I couldn’t live without, but sometimes it’s better. My webcam no longer works on xp with the official driver but I got it working within minutes using easycam on ubuntu. Same goes for my printer - I didn’t even need to search for a driver on ubuntu. It also worked perfectly with my video card straight off, XP needed the dell driver disc.</p>
<p>As with windows, external hard disks will function without having to reformat but sometimes drive mounting can be a bit weird if you’re not used to it.</p>
<p>I’m by no means a linux expert but find it much better for productive tasks, and XP for everything else like gaming, os dependant software and a familiar msn ui.</p>

<p>That is a good idea but you would be suprised how many games work perfectly under wine. CS:Source, WoW, Cod 4 are just some games that work well.<br>
Arch Linux is probably the best distro to start off with if you want a “challenge”. Ubuntu is ok if you like/can run Vista but as Moparisthebest said the community is full of retards.</p>
