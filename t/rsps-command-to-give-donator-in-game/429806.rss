Cause I have no idea what your command file (.java) is called. :o</p>
<p>EDIT: Else if you want, just make the source downloadable, and I find it for you. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>“INSERT YOUR NAME HERE”, change that to your character name in-game.<br>
“INSERT YOUR SERVER NAME HERE”, change that to your server name.<br>
Paste this somewhere in your commandspackethandler.java, but if you have another build/version of your client &amp; source, maybe it’s called like commands.java … I have no idea, but commandspackethandler is on a 562 server+ I guess.</p>
<p>If you have some problems, it’s just to ask.<br>
Enjoy!</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Command: That give someone “Donator points”</span></p>
<p><code>if(cmd[0].equals("givedp") &amp;&amp; (player.owner == 1 || player.getUsername().equals("") || player.getUsername().equals("INSERT YOUR NAME HERE"))) {
					int amount = Integer.parseInt(cmd[1]);

						other.getActionSender().sendMessage("You have received " + amount + " donator points");
						other.DonatorPoints += amount;
					}
				}</code><br>
“INSERT YOUR NAME HERE”, change it to your character name.<br>
How it works: when you’re running the server, go to your developer console(admin control panel), or do “::” to do the command… But you probably know that. Now if you’re on the developer console, just write: givedp 1 INSERT NAME HERE<br>
Change “INSERT NAME HERE” to the player name that you want to give donator points to, and change 1 to the amount donator  points you want to give.<br>
Or just write, ::givedp INSERT NAME HERE 1,<br>
and change “INSERT NAME HERE” to the player name, and 1 to the amount donator points.[/quote]<br>
thanks heaps i just don’t have commands.java or commandspacketthandler?? i’m quite confuzzled</p>
