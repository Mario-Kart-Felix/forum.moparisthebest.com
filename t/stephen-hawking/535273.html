You cannot prove anything in science. No theory will ever become a law. Laws describe observations of nature and theories are attempts to describe phenomenon. All theories have been tested multiple times. I hate when people say “Well, it’s just a theory.” A theory on television is a hypothesis and a theory in science is practically fact.</p>
<p>I understand what his theories are with hawking radiation and how black holes emit radiation and therefore explode, but have you ever listened to him talk? He is so arrogant and full of himself and he always loves pointing out that Einstein was wrong. I feel that Stephen Hawking felt Einstein was a fool because he believed in a Spinoza’s god, so he goes about trying to prove him wrong. If it had not been for his debilitating condition Hawking would never have been even probably known to the science community. He had no passion or will to do great things in life. I would say the biggest blessing Hawking has is his condition.</p>

</aside>
<p>You obviously have no idea what you’re talking about. He has probably the biggest contribution to physics and arguably science than almost any other scientist to have ever lived, with maybe the exception of Einstein for physics and Darwin for all of science. Does The Big Bang Theory ring any bells? <em>facepalm</em></p>
<p>Without Hawking, this theory would be almost entirely unfounded. He demonstrated the most essential part of the Big Bang; singularity. But it’s not like you know a thing about astrophysics to understand what that even means, as you’ve shown here.</p>
<p>As for the claims of him being “arrogant” or “lazy”, I’d love to hear some of your well thought out, reasoned examples. Or we could just stick to making wild accusations like you’ve been doing, I can do that too.</p>
<p>So, here goes: judging by your signature, you’re an angry, mislead, misinformed creationist who spends his spare time on the internet trying to refute science because he’s scared it’s a threat to his precious idea which is pretending we did not evolve and that science is completely unsound. Not only are you delusional, but it’s also just funny to see how smart you think you really are.</p>
<p>Also, your whole “just a theory” argument has been refuted time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time again. You know what else is a theory? Gravity. I suggest you go to <a href="http://www.notjustatheory.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.notjustatheory.com</a>. You seem to misunderstand the meaning of a scientific theory, which is different from our conventional use of the word theory.</p>

lol. Georges Lemaître came up with the big bang not Stephen Hawking. Facepalm. Once again, all you have shown is that you watch the documentaries that praise Stephen Hawking for his genius just because he wrote a book.</p>

</aside>
<p>lol and it seems you know even less about astrophysics than I do. Hawking did not introduce the idea of singularities in the spacetime continuum… That was Schwarzschild. Schwarzschild’s metric had two singularities, one at when the Schwarzschild radius equals the distance away from the center of the object (known as the event horizon or black hole), which was proved not to be physical, however when the distance away from the center of the body is 0, then you have a singularity which blows up towards infinity. When Schwarzschild first derived his solution to Einstein’s field equations he wrote to Einstein because this had phenomenal consequences with Einstein’s theory of expressing gravity as the curvature of a fourth dimensional riemannian manifold. Einstein didn’t believe him at first either. We know now these phenomenons as singularities or black holes which Hawking DID NOT DISCOVER.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As for the claims of him being “arrogant” or “lazy”, I’d love to hear some of your well thought out, reasoned examples. Or we could just stick to making wild accusations like you’ve been doing, I can do that too.</p>

<p>Have you listened to him? Apparently you just worship the ground he walks on.<br>

He says so HIMSELF, yes HIMSELF, that he was lazy. He was lazy and took his genius for granted, which I think of as a sin. “So Einstein was wrong when he said, ℠God does not play dice.´ Consideration of black holes suggests, not only that God does play dice, but that he sometimes confuses us by throwing them where they can’t be seen.” Have you even listened to him? He constantly brings up Einstein being wrong, which I take as him trying to prove he is smarter than Einstein. I feel that Hawking thinks of himself smarter than Einstein and wants everyone to think of himself that way. Why else would you bring up that you are right and someone else is wrong? He is basically rubbing it into Einstein’s face saying nah nah boo boo I’m right you are wrong. That is not the nature of science. The nature of science is to improve our understanding not rub it into other people’s face that they are wrong. Now I understand if you still don’t think of him as being arrogant or having a massive ego, as that is my psychological evaluation of him based on interviews with him. I just know an individual like him that is extremely smart but does not apply himself and it pisses me off. If Hawking had not gotten that debilitating disease he would have been a leech to society and not have contributed nearly as much as he has now, if any at all.</p>
<p>[quote=“xEthanx, post:6, topic:535273”]So, here goes: judging by your signature, you’re an angry, mislead, misinformed creationist who spends his spare time on the internet trying to refute science because he’s scared it’s a threat to his precious idea which is pretending we did not evolve and that science is completely unsound. Not only are you delusional, but it’s also just funny to see how smart you think you really are.[/quote] lol. I liked the part where you called me a misinformed creationist who tries to refute science haha. May I suggest you read this wikipedia article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humour" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humour</a></p>

<p>Also, your whole “just a theory” argument has been refuted time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time again. You know what else is a theory? Gravity. I suggest you go to <a href="http://www.notjustatheory.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.notjustatheory.com</a>. You seem to misunderstand the meaning of a scientific theory, which is different from our conventional use of the word theory.</p>

</aside>
<p>lol. You obviously didn’t understand a single thing I said because that is exactly what I said.</p>
<blockquote>All theories have been tested multiple times. I hate when people say "Well, it's just a theory." A theory on television is a hypothesis and a theory in science is practically fact.</blockquote>
Perhaps you are illiterate too.

<p>Stephen hawking is an arrogant, lazy individual which took a life altering disease for him to realize how stupid he truly was.

<p>Although you may be right about him being arrogant you are being extremely disrespectful calling him (as well labeling others) lazy due to the fact they have ALS which is a terminal illness. I had a very close friend who was diagnosed with it as well he passed away within a year of diagnosis. He was by no means lazy and had the same ailment as Stephen Hawking, you disgust me.</p>

He was lazy before he had ALS not afterwards. If anything he was not lazy after he got ALS because he realized he was going to die. I was not saying he was physically lazy, but he totally took his genius for granted and was a lazy student. I’m sorry for the misunderstanding and I’m sorry to hear that about your friend.</p>

<p>It’s alright sorry as well about the misunderstanding and thank you, but on other terms you are absolutely right he was a lazy student before but was subjected to a rare ailment which only 1 in 100,000 people get. I believe he has the right to be arrogant for accomplishing as much as he has and surviving ALS for over 17 years, most people who are diagnosed die within a year of prognosis.</p>
