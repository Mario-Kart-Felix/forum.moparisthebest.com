He was lazy before he had ALS not afterwards. If anything he was not lazy after he got ALS because he realized he was going to die. I was not saying he was physically lazy, but he totally took his genius for granted and was a lazy student.

<p>It’s alright sorry as well about the misunderstanding and thank you, but on other terms you are absolutely right he was a lazy student before but was subjected to a rare ailment which only 1 in 100,000 people get. I believe he has the right to be arrogant for accomplishing as much as he has and surviving ALS for over 17 years, most people who are diagnosed die within a year of prognosis.</p>

You obviously have no idea what you’re talking about.

lol. Georges Lemaître came up with the big bang not Stephen Hawking. Facepalm. Once again, all you have shown is that you watch the documentaries that praise Stephen Hawking for his genius just because he wrote a book.</p>

</aside>
<p>lol and it seems you know even less about astrophysics than I do. Hawking did not introduce the idea of singularities in the spacetime continuum… That was Schwarzschild. Schwarzschild’s metric had two singularities, one at when the Schwarzschild radius equals the distance away from the center of the object (known as the event horizon or black hole), which was proved not to be physical, however when the distance away from the center of the body is 0, then you have a singularity which blows up towards infinity. When Schwarzschild first derived his solution to Einstein’s field equations he wrote to Einstein because this had phenomenal consequences with Einstein’s theory of expressing gravity as the curvature of a fourth dimensional riemannian manifold. Einstein didn’t believe him at first either. We know now these phenomenons as singularities or black holes which Hawking DID NOT DISCOVER.</p>

He says so HIMSELF, yes HIMSELF, that he was lazy. He was lazy and took his genius for granted, which I think of as a sin. “So Einstein was wrong when he said, ℠God does not play dice.´ Consideration of black holes suggests, not only that God does play dice, but that he sometimes confuses us by throwing them where they can’t be seen.” Have you even listened to him? He constantly brings up Einstein being wrong, which I take as him trying to prove he is smarter than Einstein. I feel that Hawking thinks of himself smarter than Einstein and wants everyone to think of himself that way. Why else would you bring up that you are right and someone else is wrong? He is basically rubbing it into Einstein’s face saying nah nah boo boo I’m right you are wrong. That is not the nature of science. The nature of science is to improve our understanding not rub it into other people’s face that they are wrong. Now I understand if you still don’t think of him as being arrogant or having a massive ego, as that is my psychological evaluation of him based on interviews with him. I just know an individual like him that is extremely smart but does not apply himself and it pisses me off. If Hawking had not gotten that debilitating disease he would have been a leech to society and not have contributed nearly as much as he has now, if any at all.</p>

Stephen hawking is an arrogant, lazy individual which took a life altering disease for him to realize how stupid he truly was.

He should be known as a smart scientist who is renown because of his inability to move anything but one muscle. Definitely not the smartest in my honest opinion.<br>
[/quote]I just think you have a closed mind about what he has to say. Theres a quote from a famous scientist and it goes something along the lines of “The great thing about science is even if you don’t believe it, it is true.”</p>
<p>Stephen Hawking is a physicist and scientist. Science and physics are put through many different processes to understand what is specifically happening. All <span class="bbcode-b">theories</span>, are theories until they are proved.[/quote]<br>
You cannot prove anything in science. No theory will ever become a law. Laws describe observations of nature and theories are attempts to describe phenomenon. All theories have been tested multiple times. I hate when people say “Well, it’s just a theory.” A theory on television is a hypothesis and a theory in science is practically fact.</p>
<p>I understand what his theories are with hawking radiation and how black holes emit radiation and therefore explode, but have you ever listened to him talk? He is so arrogant and full of himself and he always loves pointing out that Einstein was wrong. I feel that Stephen Hawking felt Einstein was a fool because he believed in a Spinoza’s god, so he goes about trying to prove him wrong. If it had not been for his debilitating condition Hawking would never have been even probably known to the science community. He had no passion or will to do great things in life. I would say the biggest blessing Hawking has is his condition.</p>

              <p>[quote=“The Wanderer, post:3, topic:535273”]Stephen hawking is an arrogant, lazy individual which took a life altering disease for him to realize how stupid he truly was. Now he’s mostly just arrogant and goes about trying to prove he is smarter than Einstein although he still hasn’t done anything monumental enough in the science community to deserve a Nobel prize. He should be known as a smart scientist who is renown because of his inability to move anything but one muscle. Definitely not the smartest in my honest opinion.[/quote]I just think you have a closed mind about what he has to say. Theres a quote from a famous scientist and it goes something along the lines of “The great thing about science is even if you don’t believe it, it is true.”</p>
<p>Stephen Hawking is a physicist and scientist. Science and physics are put through many different processes to understand what is specifically happening. All <span class="bbcode-b">theories</span>, are theories until they are proved.</p>
