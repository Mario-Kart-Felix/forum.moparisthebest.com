    <description>I&#39;m currently having issues creating a Dialogue with my 317 PI server. I have read many tutorials and even tried to use Dialogue Creation Tools but none of them get me the results I want, and none of the tutorials are getting through to me.

Can someone explain to me how to get this Dialogue working? (I do not need the coords for the locations, i just need an understanding on how i would get this to work.)

              <p>This might look hard, but it really is not. Let me give you an example.</p>
<p>1 second. I will edit this.</p>
<p>Alright, the dialogue is self-explanatory I guess. you get 4 options ok.</p>
<p>Then you will have to search the cases of the options. and the most important thing. you would have to make an int so you can seperate options. i.e;<br>
you want to do something on case 9169. but there’s already done something there. then you could seperate it by doing this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>[code]            case 9158:<br>
c.sendMessage(“You teleport to the Clan Wars minigame.”);<br>
c.teleportToX = 2589;<br>
c.teleportToY = 9423;<br>
Option = 1;</p>
<pre><code>		c.heightLevel = 0;
                c.RemoveAllWindows();
                c.RemoveAllWindows();
            } else {
</code></pre>
<p>//do stuff<br>
Option = 2;<br>
break;[/code]</p>
<p>Alright. That’s one thing.</p>
<p>The thing you are planning doing isn’t much harder. you could do something like this:</p>
<p>[code]</p>
<p>case 9159:  (the case of the dialogue. make sure to check what it is)</p>
<pre><code>            selectoption(
                    "@dre@Where would you like to go?",
                    "Monsters",
					"Bosses",
					"Mini-Games",
                    "Pking", "");
</code></pre>
<p>Option = 3;<br>
break;[/code]</p>
<p>and of those 4 options you could make many more options and eventually a teleport. It’s really easy.</p>
