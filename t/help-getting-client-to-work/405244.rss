    <title>Help getting client to work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-getting-client-to-work/405244</link>
    <description>I have been messing around with creating my own private server for months. I have no problem finding a source or making the server run the way i want it to, but with every source or base i ever work with the same problem occurs with every one. I can run the server, open up the client, and log in. However when i click log in the screen and map are black. I can see the chat box and my inventory (although it is empty) but just about everything else is black. My problem basically is that i can log in, just not play. Also i should mention, this problem doesn&#39;t start right away. i could be playing on a server for days and have everything working perfect then this problem happens again randomly. I have no clue what is causing me this problem and i am asking for help on how to possibly fix it. Please Help! :(</description>
