    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-port-forwould/325547</link>
    <description>ok  hi guys my first tut and ima show u step bye step with pics how to port forwould (sorry about the spelling )



This is one off the hardest tut&#39;s to get rite and looking over my time trina work out how to port forwould there is always one or to things missing that ppl forget to put in and it&#39;s always the moste inportent so here we go 

Diffecalty 4/10

THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW :: geting into your router need pass ect how to download and have an emial adress

THINGS U WILL NEED:: you need java jre not jdk coz we ant codeing a sorce im going to be useing 317 it it the essyest to use and internet :P 

Things i should menchen ::the only routers i know this works with atm is d -link and linksys but yours mite work so still try 



Ok enough with the chit chat lets get started first we gonna go setup a no-ip account.

go to :: http://www.no-ip.com/

now register with them it cost nothing  once u register with them log in.

now ull see a page like this .

[img]http://i973.photobucket.com/albums/ae218/darthax/1st.jpg[/img]

Now go to add hoste:: bye clicking


[IMG]http://i973.photobucket.com/albums/ae218/darthax/1st-1.jpg[/img]

now ull need to make a hoste
[IMG]http://i973.photobucket.com/albums/ae218/darthax/1st-2.jpg[/img]

Now 1. is hoste name come up with something creative add it into the hote name box

now 2. select what u wont you end ip to be in the pic is the moste commen no-ip.biz

now 3.create hoste click and your dun with that bit.

also there is a duc download on the side i donte use it coz it,s pointless just tells u if accounts online.


ok that was the essy bit now for the little bit tricky bit.

1. go to start in your tool bar in left hand corner off the screen look for run

2.typ in the run box CMD

[IMG]http://i973.photobucket.com/albums/ae218/darthax/ggg.jpg[/img]


Then ull get a box that looks like this..:: typ in that box ipconfig

[IMG]http://i973.photobucket.com/albums/ae218/darthax/ip.jpg[/img]


after you have dun that ull get info like in the next pic 

[IMG]http://i973.photobucket.com/albums/ae218/darthax/this-1.jpg[/img]


you will need only one ip from this box it will be called ipv4 or ip adress or somthing differnt it is not your defalt getaway adress .




Now for the last and hard part seting up the router. THIS IS THE BIT THAT GET&#39;S HARD (well not really)

ok open up your web browser and typ in your router ip adress


[IMG]http://i973.photobucket.com/albums/ae218/darthax/this-2.jpg[/img]

you may get a box ascing for a paaword d-link defalt user nd pass is ::user::admin ::pass:: admin

if that dosent work for your router go to google and look for your routers dfalt   pass word


now in d-link router the is a tab with advanced click it not shure what it is for outher routers but i will look it up and add it to here ...




once you have goten into your router ull should have a page the same as mine or simerla ..



[IMG]http://i973.photobucket.com/albums/ae218/darthax/last.jpg[/img]


Now 1. in the first box typ in your server name.

now 2. in to is the importent ip adress typ in the ip adress you got from when we did ipconfig

now 3. three is the port nubers they will bothe be the same 43594 43594

now 4. is click apply 

last thing once u have dun all that use your no-ip ip name so it would be something like 

Youripname.no-ip.biz in your 317 client or in your 508 525 562 client when your server is running off corse 

and hopefully this all worked.







thanx for viewing my tut hope u like it play comment also if i have missed simething let me know i know about spelling mistakes ill read over and fix them but coment and rep tyvm and have a nice runescape privet server day.</description>
