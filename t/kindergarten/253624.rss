    <description>Once upon a time there was a kindergarten. There were several children. Every single one was different. There was Jimmy. Jimmy was a strong kid, and during playing time he always managed to get nearly all the normal blocks. Then there was Boris, he was almost as strong as Jimmy. Boris always got the remaining blocks that Jimmy didn&#39;t get. Georg, who had all the roof parts, was present too. There weren&#39;t that many roof parts, but they were needed to make a nice block house. Georg was friends with Jimmy, at least that was what it looked like. Georg had to do what Jimmy told him. Last but not least, there was Al. Al had nothing. Al wasn&#39;t strong, but he wasn&#39;t a quitter either. Jimmy, Boris and Georg traded their parts so that they each could build their own house. Jimmy&#39;s house was the biggest, Georg&#39;s house was the best looking, and Boris made several small, ugly houses. Al had nothing, all he could do is destroy the houses the others had built. But he only did that if the others bullied him.

If Jimmy thought he didn&#39;t have enough blocks, he&#39;d demand the others to give him some of theirs. He didn&#39;t care if the others got in trouble because of it. 

One day, a new kid came. His name was Chi. Chi became friends with Boris, and Boris gave some of his blocks to Chi. Not many, but enough to get Chi on Boris&#39; side. Jimmy didn&#39;t like it. But it was too late, Chi was on Boris&#39; side.

Jimmy was pissed off. What if Al joined Boris too. He would loose everything he had. A group led by Boris was devastating. Jimmy quickly attacked Chi. But Chi was just like Al. He could hide. Jimmy was furious, and started throwing big blocks at Chi. He hit Chi on the head. Georg didn&#39;t like this overkill, but said nothing. There was blood everywhere. But Chi didn&#39;t give up. Jimmy felt defeated, and stopped attacking Chi. Al did nothing, he didn&#39;t want to join Boris. He hated Boris just as bad.

The next day, when the kids arrived, Jimmy&#39;s prettiest house was destroyed. Nobody knew who did it, maybe Boris did it; maybe it was Georg. Maybe Jimmy did it himself. But Jimmy attacked Al. He ordered Georg to help him, or else Georg wouldn&#39;t get anymore blocks.

Al was fast, and hid often. Then he&#39;d throw a pebble at Jimmy or Georg, and ran away again. Jimmy and Georg didn&#39;t know what to do. If they gave up, there was a possibility that Al destroyed another of Jimmy&#39;s houses. If they kept hunting down Al, they&#39;d get exhausted and get hurt. 

What to do?</description>
