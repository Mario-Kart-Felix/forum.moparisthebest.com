              <p>if your using moparscape web client you dont start a server on that.<br>
there can be multiple problems</p>
<p>no JDK<br>
not portfowarded<br>
to protforward you go to command prompt and type in ipconfig<br>
the type in you default gateway into you address on internet explorer enter your username and password then<br>
get your ip address can be found in ipconfig or on the setup page of your router, after this go to applications and gaming enter start and end as 43594 and keep the “both” box as it is. then after it shows you this(example: 192.168.1.(blank) enter your last number of your ip address there then click enable. after this go to security and uncheck the first box then your done portfowarding (: and your server should be up and running!</p>
<p>oh and you need a host from <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a> log onto your server using your ip address after this.</p>
