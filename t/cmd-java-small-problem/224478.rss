    <title>Cmd|Java, Small problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cmd-java-small-problem/224478</link>
    <description>I really need help on this, well when I got into Programming I started off with newbie bases and fed off em and learnt from moparscape (mostly got spoonfed because the tuts those days sucked). 
but erm My first ever source isn&#39;t &quot;SILAB&quot; and I miss it :(
I stopped this source because it had this problem that really pissed me off...

When I run my server after it&#39;s on for like 3 hours I check Task manager then processes and it&#39;s full of Java.exe and Cmd.exe it made my computer REALLY slow and my server UBER lag so I would have to end all of those processes or restart my computer.
PLEASE help me with this I really want to use my old source, I&#39;m really bored of silab servers.

Inside my run.bat
[code]
@echo off
color 0b
title Barragezaros
set java=&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0\bin\java.exe&quot;
java -Xmx1024m -cp .;./jython.jar;./MySql/mysql-connector-java-3.0.17-ga-bin.jar server
pause[/code]
that looks fine..TO ME and I&#39;m not too good at programming so it would be awesome if you could help me with this.</description>

<p>I only left my server running for just 30 mins and this is how much I got, Usually would get A LOT MORE.<br>
I don’t know if this is a promlem or not but I have a restarter that only needs run.bat to be ran it restarts alone every 30 mins.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 09, 2008, 02:31:49 pm[/size][hr]Guess this isn’t solvable… :s</p>
