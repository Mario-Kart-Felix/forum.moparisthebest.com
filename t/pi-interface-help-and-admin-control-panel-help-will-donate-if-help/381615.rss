    <description>Ok guys i have a PI based client and I currently have a rank on my server called House-Ownership and with this it allowes...
Players to donate money to buy a house in game witht there house they can add a teleporter that goes anywhere and monsters or object or anything like that but the problem is I have to add all the objects and items. At first it was ok cuz i only had like 2 ppl donate for it and now I have like 10 ppl have houses and it is so much work for me to add object for all the time
I was wondering if u could make me a tutorial on how to do this....
if there houseOwnership ==1 they can type a command that will make an interface appear with a list of objects they can spawn in there house and it will permanantely keep them there!
If you could make this I will donate to you or do anything u want!!

Also for my PI I really really really want to make my music tab at the bottom  right corner an admins tab..
only admins can open the tab and when u open it it looks like this...

Info- type the playername in the box and select a command
       [ Box to type playername in ]
[] ban user                   [] ip ban user
[] mute user                 [] ipmute user
[] promote user             [] demote user
[] give item to user        [] give donator to user

              [ Confirm ]
 

and when the admin types the player name in the box and selects one of the commands and hits confirm it will do one of the commands!
if u can make one of these work i will donate a fortune to u and if u can do both omg i would love u!!!! no home 
If u could give me a tutorial link if u make one i will do my best to help u on anything u need and u will be my frikin idol!!!!!!</description>
