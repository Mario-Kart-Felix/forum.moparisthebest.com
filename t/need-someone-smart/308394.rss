    <description>MY SERVER NULLS SO FRICKEN CONSTANTLY.
Delta base, 317. There&#39;s no errors while compiling, no anti leeches. Sometimes when players try to log in, or after they DC, they get nulled. Their screen is black, they can&#39;t click anything, but they can type. Others can see what they type, and they can see their characters. The person that&#39;s typings name comes up as &quot;Null&quot; to him, and his regular name to others. The only way i can fix this is by restarting the server. Is anyone smart enough to fix this? Thanks.</description>

Theres so much shitty code in Delta it will do this I believe, I ran into this problem with Deltascape but that was over a year ago and you should stop using this base unless you want to waste your time cleaning it out and deleting useless code.<br>

Already cleaned it out, and i wasn’t asking for opinions on the delta source, i was asking for a way to fix this nulling. Aparrantly nobody is clever enough to fix it, and neither am i.[/quote]</p>
<p>Just because we don’t tell you how doesn’t mean we don’t know. Deltascape has an anti-mopar client system that nulls specific clients.</p>
