    <title>Differences between 308 and 517</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/differences-between-308-and-517/407591</link>
    <description>First off hi, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever posted here before, but I&#39;ve been messing around with RSPS for a while. I can&#39;t seem to find a definite answer to my issue. I&#39;m looking for a base that&#39;s coded fairly well, that adding to and maintaining isn&#39;t like pulling teeth, I am also trying to find out what the exact differences are between a base server from something like Cheezscape, one of the 308 base servers, and a 517 base server. 

So far the only differences I can find are that the 317 are usually filled with alot of pk, bases, and don&#39;t really have much else. Whereas the 517+ needs the 517+ cache, and it&#39;s own client, plus their isn&#39;t a huge 20k+ line client file, which is a huge plus, the thought of having the majority of the code in one file is a daunting issue for me. Considering I&#39;m a modern day coder, that likes the code I&#39;m working with to be normalized at least somewhat. 

What I&#39;m asking is that someone kindly point me to a empty base, with preferably no skills other then, moving and combat related skill(not a requirement, but I&#39;ve never liked either of those lol), done that way I can truly code the server.

Any help with this would be great, even if it&#39;s just a point in the right direction.</description>

317’s have crappy graphics, less emotes, bad items and alot more. but they are easier to code. 508’s haicer graphics. a few more emotes and the items look better so does the map. but are alot harder to code<br>
and yeah. not really supposed to post this here<br>

They are both java… the only main difference is most of the 500+ servers are packaged, while most of the common 317s are classes all within the same directory. Difficulty of programming them is relative, actually hardly any differences in them.[/quote]</p>

<p>508 is not harder to code then a 317… The only reason people have difficulty is because they either don’t know the basics of Java or the RS2 protocol…</p>

              <p>ok well then is there a base 500+ that includes the basic things such as movement and the client side along with a 500+ cache, without all the skills(aside from maybe combat), npcs, and extra objects?</p>
<p>plus here is another question, is it possible to have construction or map editing using 317, or something like cheezscape?</p>
