        <p>Hello there,<br>
I wanted to post a tutorial here today for the people who are suffering with their Cache’<br>
It can be hard to understand it, it sure took me a while…<br>
So, I want to teach you guys how to change your “Cache Path” There are multiple servers still as of today, that are using C:/ as their path and are having major problems with it.<br>
This method here will make your client work with a MAC OS X as well, not to mention that, it will also locate the Cache if placed in your (C:/ Or Users.home)<br>
I have a Macbook pro and sometimes I prefer to use that for coding via (Eclipse) So I have modified this to work with MAC.<br>
Anyways, enough with the chit chat <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> and back to work!</p>
<p>[Files we will be working on today:<br>
[Signlink.java] [Client Sided] [Difficulty: 1.5/10]</p>
<p>First thing you want to do is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open Your Client Folder,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Locate (Signlink.java) In Your Client Files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open File (Signlink.java) With Notepad Or Notepad++ (Preferably Notepad++ ) (Mac users use: “Sublime Text 2 Or TextEdit”)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once Opened, Search For: " public static String findcachedir() "</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once Found, Keep In Mind That Your “Code” Will Most Likely Will Be Different, But usual PI’s like: Lost Leg, InsidiaX, Hyperion, Deathly will have C:/ and some Users.home. Anyways, You’re going to find 2 Codes on some 3. You Can Scroll Down Slowly From " public static String findcachedir() " And Eventually You Will Find: " public static String sencondDir() { " And On Some Servers You Might Have A Third One, If You Do It Should Be Right Under " public static String sencondDir() { " It’s Called: " public static String findcachedirORIG() " And If You Don’t Have That It’s Fine, We Will Be Adding It Today…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace All 2, If You’ve Found 3, Then Change/Replace All 3 Codes With These Below:<br>
(FYI) The 3 Codes Are:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>[CODE]</p>
<ol>
<li>public static String findcachedir()</li>
<li>public static String sencondDir() {</li>
<li>public static String findcachedirORIG()<br>
[/CODE]</li>
</ol>
<p>The New Codes You Will Be Replacing The Old Ones With:</p>
<p>[CODE]<br>
public static String findcachedir()<br>
{<br>
boolean exists = (new File(System.getProperty(“user.home”) + “/YourCacheNameHere/”)).exists();<br>
if (exists) {<br>
return System.getProperty(“user.home”) + “/YourCacheNameHere/”;<br>
} else {<br>
File f = new File(System.getProperty(“user.home”) + “/YourCacheNameHere/”);<br>
f.mkdir();<br>
return System.getProperty(“user.home”) + “/YourCacheNameHere/”;<br>
}<br>
}<br>
public static String sencondDir() {<br>
File file = new File(“c:/YourCacheNameHere/”);<br>
if (!file.exists())<br>
file.mkdir();<br>
return file.toString();<br>
}</p>
<pre><code>public static String findcachedirORIG()
{
    String as[] = {
        "c:/windows/", "c:/winnt/", "d:/windows/", "d:/winnt/", "e:/windows/", "e:/winnt/", "f:/windows/", "f:/winnt/", "c:/", "~/",
        "/tmp/", "", "c:/rscache", "/rscache"
    };
    if(storeid &lt; 32 || storeid &gt; 34)
        storeid = 32;
    String s = ".file_store_" + storeid;
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; as.length; i++)
        try
        {
            String s1 = as[i];
            if(s1.length() &gt; 0)
            {
                File file = new File(s1);
                if(!file.exists())
                    continue;
            }
            File file1 = new File(s1 + s);
            if(file1.exists() || file1.mkdir())
                return s1 + s + "/";
        }
        catch(Exception _ex) { }
 
    return null;

}

<p>[/CODE]</p>
<p>Now this should work with most PI’s … Remember this only shows/teaches you how to change your “Cache Path, IN: SIGNLINK.JAVA” It has nothing to do with your (Cache Downloader) If you have any errors, please post below and I will try to help you out.<br>
I hope this helps you guys! Good luck!</p>

Sure, your code is neater, that’s cool. However, it still works.<br>
I’ve had a lot of client&amp;Cache problems on Mac. This seemed to have fixed it for me. If you manually place your cache in (Users.home) IN (MAC) Picture here: ( <a href="http://prntscr.com/7rn0pg" rel="nofollow noopener">http://prntscr.com/7rn0pg</a> ) Then it should work with this code.<br>
I know it can be improved much much more, but maybe by someone else, maybe I’ll do it, who knows. I just released what I have knowledge of, if I knew how to do it any better, believe me I would have.</li>

<p>And The first code is for Users.home… The second is for c:/</p>

Yes but I was just explaining (very poorly) that what you have is alright, but can be improved (Code can <span class="bbcode-i">always</span> be improved).<br>
And that you don’t need the extra methods, because… well why have them?<br>
They’re just taking up space, especially when they’re not being used.</p>

Lol when I needed help with this, it was hard and I wanted to try and see what I could do on my own.<br>
Sure, your code is neater, that’s cool. However, it still works.<br>
I’ve had a lot of client&amp;Cache problems on Mac. This seemed to have fixed it for me. If you manually place your cache in (Users.home) IN (MAC) Picture here: ( <a href="http://prntscr.com/7rn0pg" rel="nofollow noopener">http://prntscr.com/7rn0pg</a> ) Then it should work with this code.<br>
I know it can be improved much much more, but maybe by someone else, maybe I’ll do it, who knows. I just released what I have knowledge of, if I knew how to do it any better, believe me I would have.<br>

Yes but I was just explaining (very poorly) that what you have is alright, but can be improved (Code can <span class="bbcode-i">always</span> be improved).<br>
And that you don’t need the extra methods, because… well why have them?<br>
They’re just taking up space, especially when they’re not being used.[/quote]<br>
No Arguing with that, I fully agree! It can be improved much more.<br>
Thank you for letting me know about the “extra methods”</p>
