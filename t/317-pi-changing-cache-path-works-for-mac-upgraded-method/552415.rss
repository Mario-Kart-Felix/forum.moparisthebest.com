    <title>[317] (PI) Changing Cache Path. (Works for MAC) (Upgraded Method)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-pi-changing-cache-path-works-for-mac-upgraded-method/552415</link>
    <description>Hello there,
I wanted to post a tutorial here today for the people who are suffering with their Cache&#39;
It can be hard to understand it, it sure took me a while...
So, I want to teach you guys how to change your &quot;Cache Path&quot; There are multiple servers still as of today, that are using C:/ as their path and are having major problems with it.
This method here will make your client work with a MAC OS X as well, not to mention that, it will also locate the Cache if placed in your (C:/ Or Users.home)
I have a Macbook pro and sometimes I prefer to use that for coding via (Eclipse) So I have modified this to work with MAC.
Anyways, enough with the chit chat :p and back to work!

[Files we will be working on today:
[Signlink.java] [Client Sided] [Difficulty: 1.5/10]

First thing you want to do is: 

1. Open Your Client Folder,

2. Locate (Signlink.java) In Your Client Files.

3. Open File (Signlink.java) With Notepad Or Notepad++ (Preferably Notepad++ ) (Mac users use: &quot;Sublime Text 2 Or TextEdit&quot;)

4. Once Opened, Search For: &quot; public static String findcachedir() &quot;

5. Once Found, Keep In Mind That Your &quot;Code&quot; Will Most Likely Will Be Different, But usual PI&#39;s like: Lost Leg, InsidiaX, Hyperion, Deathly will have C:/ and some Users.home. Anyways, You&#39;re going to find 2 Codes on some 3. You Can Scroll Down Slowly From &quot; public static String findcachedir() &quot; And Eventually You Will Find: &quot; public static String sencondDir() { &quot; And On Some Servers You Might Have A Third One, If You Do It Should Be Right Under &quot; public static String sencondDir() { &quot; It&#39;s Called: &quot; public static String findcachedirORIG() &quot; And If You Don&#39;t Have That It&#39;s Fine, We Will Be Adding It Today...

6. Replace All 2, If You&#39;ve Found 3, Then Change/Replace All 3 Codes With These Below:    
(FYI) The 3 Codes Are: 
[CODE]
1. public static String findcachedir()
2. public static String sencondDir() {
3. public static String findcachedirORIG()
[/CODE]

The New Codes You Will Be Replacing The Old Ones With:
[CODE]
public static String findcachedir()
    {
        boolean exists = (new File(System.getProperty(&quot;user.home&quot;) + &quot;/YourCacheNameHere/&quot;)).exists();
        if (exists) {
            return System.getProperty(&quot;user.home&quot;) + &quot;/YourCacheNameHere/&quot;;
        } else {
            File f = new File(System.getProperty(&quot;user.home&quot;) + &quot;/YourCacheNameHere/&quot;);
            f.mkdir();
            return System.getProperty(&quot;user.home&quot;) + &quot;/YourCacheNameHere/&quot;;
        }
    }
	public static String sencondDir() {
		File file = new File(&quot;c:/YourCacheNameHere/&quot;);
		if (!file.exists())
			file.mkdir();
		return file.toString();
	}
	
	public static String findcachedirORIG()
    {
        String as[] = {
            &quot;c:/windows/&quot;, &quot;c:/winnt/&quot;, &quot;d:/windows/&quot;, &quot;d:/winnt/&quot;, &quot;e:/windows/&quot;, &quot;e:/winnt/&quot;, &quot;f:/windows/&quot;, &quot;f:/winnt/&quot;, &quot;c:/&quot;, &quot;~/&quot;,
            &quot;/tmp/&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;c:/rscache&quot;, &quot;/rscache&quot;
        };
        if(storeid &lt; 32 || storeid &gt; 34)
            storeid = 32;
        String s = &quot;.file_store_&quot; + storeid;
        for(int i = 0; i &lt; as.length; i++)
            try
            {
                String s1 = as[i];
                if(s1.length() &gt; 0)
                {
                    File file = new File(s1);
                    if(!file.exists())
                        continue;
                }
                File file1 = new File(s1 + s);
                if(file1.exists() || file1.mkdir())
                    return s1 + s + &quot;/&quot;;
            }
            catch(Exception _ex) { }
     
        return null;
 
    }
[/CODE]


Now this should work with most PI&#39;s ... Remember this only shows/teaches you how to change your &quot;Cache Path, IN: SIGNLINK.JAVA&quot; It has nothing to do with your (Cache Downloader) If you have any errors, please post below and I will try to help you out.
I hope this helps you guys! Good luck!</description>

Lol when I needed help with this, it was hard and I wanted to try and see what I could do on my own.<br>
Sure, your code is neater, that’s cool. However, it still works.<br>
I’ve had a lot of client&amp;Cache problems on Mac. This seemed to have fixed it for me. If you manually place your cache in (Users.home) IN (MAC) Picture here: ( <a href="http://prntscr.com/7rn0pg" rel="nofollow noopener">http://prntscr.com/7rn0pg</a> ) Then it should work with this code.<br>
I know it can be improved much much more, but maybe by someone else, maybe I’ll do it, who knows. I just released what I have knowledge of, if I knew how to do it any better, believe me I would have.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Yes but I was just explaining (very poorly) that what you have is alright, but can be improved (Code can <span class="bbcode-i">always</span> be improved).<br>
And that you don’t need the extra methods, because… well why have them?<br>
They’re just taking up space, especially when they’re not being used.[/quote]<br>
No Arguing with that, I fully agree! It can be improved much more.<br>
Thank you for letting me know about the “extra methods”</p>
