    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/playing-card-probability/340334</link>
    <description>Hi, I have recently changed sets in my maths group and my homework is Probability. May i add i suck at probability soo... Heres the question

I have made the useful information [b]Bold[/b]

A playing card is drawn from the pack of [b]52 Cards[/b], It is then replaced, The pack is then shuffled and then another card is drawn. Find the probability that :-

[ul][li]The two cards were [b]both Clubs[/b][/li]
[li]The two cards were [b]both Red King[/b]s[/li]
[li]The first card was a [b]two[/b] and the second card was [b]red[/b][/li]
[li]One card was a [b]Jack[/b] and the other card was [b]red[/b][/li]
