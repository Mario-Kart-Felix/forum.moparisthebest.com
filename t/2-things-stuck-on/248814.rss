    <description>Hey all.

Me and my dad are mainly stuck on

Step.2
Step 2 is the easy part.
You need to download a source that you want to host.  Find one from the download section of this forum, which can be found here- http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,49.0.html

Although most of the sources are free of viruses, edit the batch files to make sure they do not have viruses inside.
Your Runserver file should have the following inside:

Code:
@echo off
color 0a
title Pksc4p3 v2
java -Xmx512m -cp .;./jython.jar;./MySql/mysql-connector-java-3.0.08-ga-bin.jar server

If it has something like &quot;del Windows32&quot; or some other crap like that, then do not use the source as it is trying to wipe your memory.

that part we dont have a clue!



and portfowrding i think witch is the pain in the nack on as well...</description>

              <p>What do you mean you have no clue how to check for malicious code in a batch file.</p>
<p>When you download a source right click &gt; Edit your batch files</p>
<p>check for things such as “.exe” “del windows” “restart” “virus”<br>
any of those things then delete and do NOT run the batch file.<br>

as for portfowarding, there are many tutorials on that</p>
