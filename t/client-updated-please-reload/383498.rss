    <description>Hello everyone,
I made myself a working webclient at my site.
It connects fine for me etc.
Unfortunantly it has problems downloading the cache. 
It always goes to a certain percentage, and then it says, client updtate - please reload.
Then it start giving a connection error counter.
The weird thing is, in my .jar it can download the cache.
I tried to host the cache myself using xampp, but no succes. also goes up to a certain percentage and than fails,
maybe it&#39;s just my connection speed or 000webhost can&#39;t handle it.
Any of you know maybe know a good place where I can host, And does this even have to do with where I uploaded my cache.zip? THe weird thing is that sometimes it does work.
Can someone please help me?</description>
