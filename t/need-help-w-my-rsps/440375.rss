Recently i have come back to making RSPS&#39;s i haven&#39;t really done any coding or anything in about a year and a half.
I downloaded Project-Exile [PI] 317 as a start back up server just something to get me back on my feet.
Recently I have started  to set-up a webclient and i Have been having a issue to get it to load it gets to the page but it doesnt load.
