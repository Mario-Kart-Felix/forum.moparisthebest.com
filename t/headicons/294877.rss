    <description>Hello, I was wondering what class handled the display of headicons. I&#39;ve been drawn to 30_2_1_1, method 349, but I&#39;ve ran into a small quirk. The server writes a byte that will display the head icon, and it does it by powers of two. Like 1 is melee protect, 2 is range, 4 is mage, 8, 16, and 32 are the redemption, smite, retribution, 64(2 ^ 6) is the KQ prayer, and in my cache, headicon 128 (2 ^ 7) is the wildy icon. and 255 is all of the icons at once. My question is, how can I make the client interpret the head icon number to be the image index in the cache, rather than 2 to the X power.

For example, how could I do something like this?
headicon 0 - melee protect
headicon 1 - range protect
headicon X - X is the index in the cache
headicon 7 - wildy icon
etc.

The only sort of bitshift operation I see is
[code]
int l1 = -(l &gt;&gt; 2);
l = -(l &amp; 3);[/code]

But it&#39;s not bringing up any sort of index or anything. So if anyone has any information about it, I would really appreciate it.

Also, If anyone has a copy of how Bluurrs client handles the head icons, I would like to take a look at that.</description>
