    <description>Alright I&#39;ve never tackled clients to much extent before. Now recently I need to so I&#39;ve been editing some things and getting better as time passes. Now I&#39;ve tried a couple ways to figure this out for myself before asking but now I&#39;m fed up and I&#39;m asking for help. What I need to do is know how to add new skulls without removing the old ones. All I need to know is what to add to Class30_sub2_sub1_sub1, if it goes there. Also I&#39;m looking to fix the height of the skull + prayer head icons. Also please make things at least somewhat detailed so I can understand but  don&#39;t make it copy and paste so I can learn. Thanks ^.^</description>
