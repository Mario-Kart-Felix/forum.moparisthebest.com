    <title>99 Skills when login</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/99-skills-when-login/460074</link>
    <description>I have a project insanity server, to start. When people login to my server, it shows them 99 skills all of their skills are 99. But it&#39;s not really 99 it just shows it, how do I fix this so when they login , it shows correct statistics? like all 0 except hitpoints are 10. In playerassistant.java ? please I really need this fixed. TY. I also added new chars into the files from my old source, could this be the problem ? Thanks!</description>
