[b]-Information about me[/b][/u]
Hello everyone at MoparScape. My names Dean,and i am trying to do what it seems everyone is failing to do. My dream is to bring back Runescape, to what it was and still should be. Now, in order to fufill this dream, i need alot more help doing this then i currently have. I am requesting some help, creating and bringing this reality to life.

[b][u]-What i need.[/u][/b]
I need everything ranging from coders; to web designers. I am not sure which base i will be running; as delta seems a lil&#39; to buggy to be used for a private server that is expected to be one of the most popular servers ever created.

[u][b]-Why we are better then the rest.[/b][/u]
I mean comeon, look at the other 317 remakes, they have been around, but who has actually released a game availible to be played?

[center]Be sure to comment/pm/contact me if you are intersted in joining, we will make this work.I&#39;ve been trying to make remakes for ever,and decided hell. Let me invest some time/money into this project and actually make it a reality.I&#39;ve been playing RS since eh around 2004-2005 and i really loved it back in the day, i have fond memories of the game, and think everyone else should enjoy it as much as i did. It&#39;d bring great joy to me and many others, seeing how many other forums/servers trying to remake RS 06&#39; have great success.But, no one has actually been able to bring it out yet, so if we could be the first team to develop RS 06&#39; The way it used to and still should be, it would be amazing.[/center]

<p>We are still working on this, and yes, we’re working on another server as well. Now, that being said. Skiire, hope that you can get your partnership going with your dialogues, for i’m not kokoface. XD So I wouldn’t know if he would like to help you or not, but I don’t want to help, because i’ve been working on mine, on getting the dialogues myself. And yes, indeed, it is quite boring. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

              <p>You seem to be lacking a strong  plan in order for you to achieve your goals. I’m not sure if you’re just neglecting to include that within this thread or you haven’t actually thought this through. The amount of content in a <span class="hashtag">#198</span> server would take months to recreate in my opinion and a <span class="hashtag">#317</span> has 10 fold the amount of content. I think anyone who wants to create a remake of RuneScape and use a revision higher then around <span class="hashtag">#474</span> are fools as there is just far too much content to replicate for the size teams that are typically assembled.</p>
<p>Anyways, I’ve been working on my remake, as a hobby, since early January. I’ve been working with a life-long friend on this development, however lately he’s found himself unable to find time to continue development. This is fine with me as I’m capable of working on the server, but I always enjoyed the company. It’s rather boring without having someone else suggesting ideas, abusing pre-made content for potential bugs, etc.</p>
<p>Anyways, back to my proposition. I noticed you posted asking to work with someone in the thread, and I want a partner of sorts. I don’t want another developer with access to my source files, but I’ve recently started the daunting task of dialogues. I find this extremely boring to-do because I don’t have the dialogues already and as such I have to watch youtube videos or even worse, log into RuneScape in order to obtain them.</p>
<p>I’ve seen the way you communicate and there’s just something about you that makes me feel as though we’d get along. So my proposition is that we can work together for a while recreating dialogues? It won’t be a permanent partnership, but  it should be a few weeks or months depending on how much progress we make daily. If you’re interested, even slightly, please private message me.</p>
