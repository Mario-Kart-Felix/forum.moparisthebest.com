    <description>[center][font=tahoma][size=14pt][u][b]Heya all! This is united0wnage here with a GUIDE to making good money on your account or just a level three skillerz.[/b][/u][/size]

This is for everyone here NOT into botting(lol like there is anyone) I&#39;m gonna make a guide of my own for a cheap way for your skiller to make a few bucks in runescape (members only way sorry). 

Well first oiff your skiller is gonna need 35 farming. I THINK!

1. Rake
2. Shovel
3. seed dibbler
4. 3x super compost
5. 3x ranarr seeds
6. a few fally tele tabs, cammy tele tabs and a few ardy teletabs.. 
7. Bring a few plant cures along as a just-in-case. :)

Now your gonna first tele to cammy, run to catherby and rake at the herb patch. place down some super compost, and plant your seed.

Next, teleport to fally and run to the herb patch there (go to south entrance then go to left if facing south) repeat what you did in the first patch

thenn teleport to ardy and do the same.

Play Castle wars, pest, fist of guthix, whatever to just get some time by, go pick your rannars and bank.

Just keep repeating steps. You should have earned back what you paid for with the seeds by the fourth or fifth seed. 

Good luck!

Ranarr seeds suck for cash, snapdragons are the way to go. For experience just do trees (unless you’re poor as fuck), and do farm runs once or twice a day.<br>

<p>Lol, no. I’ve gotten over 5 runs done in a day…[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m talking trees, they take what? 7 hours or so to grow?</p>
