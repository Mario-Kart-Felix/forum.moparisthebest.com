    <description>This whole topic is about[url=http://www.icpnet.pl/~pest/Pest/scarScripts/guildm.txt]GuildMiner knightstreak &amp; DeadlyDragon[/url]. You can find the script here http://www.icpnet.pl/~pest/Pest/scarScripts/guildm.txt

Long time ago when I used to play RS I used to help the makers of [url=http://www.icpnet.pl/~pest/Pest/scarScripts/guildm.txt]GuildMiner knightstreak &amp; DeadlyDragon[/url]. I used to help them with testing the script and stuff and I used to give them ideas on how to improve the script. Sadly I was talking to one of the authors of the sciprt and he told me he quit scripting. 

I am starting to play RS again. I was counting on this script help me mine coal in the guild. Sadly this whole script is out of date. This script is the best guildminer script ever. At the time I used to play RS this script used to mine for more than 7hours straight. 

I was thinking if some experienced scripter and make an updated version of this script. I can help them test and give ideas. I really need this script. Update this script for me and add the following features to it. 

Things that don&#39;t work anymore:
&lt;blockquote&gt;1. Everytime you log into the game I get a screen that says some things and ask&#39;s to to [b]Click Here to Play[/b]. The screen says stuff llike [b]Pin/Recovery Question Last Set/ 0 unread messages/ your not a member[/b]. Then in the bottom it has a red button that says [b]Click Here to Play[/b]. 

2. The statue doesn&#39;t show up in the minimap anymore when I play the game.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Things to add in the script:

1. Fix the problem with the [b]Click Here to Play[/b].
2. Fix the problem with where you have to add color of the statue in the minimap. 
3. Make it logout randomly. After some time make it log back it. This keep you from getting banned. 
4. Put in some features that are found in this sciprt http://www.angelfire.com/ab8/stupid3ooo/StupidGuildminer.scp

Please I am begging you to help me update this script.</description>

              <p>SRL is scar resource library. A group of advanced scripters started it and basicly SRL is a huge include that can do many things. its very useful. I could do this for you but why not learn a little bit of coding? its very simple, goto the login procedure in the script and add this to the start,<br>
clickmouse(123,321)</p>
<p>change 123,321 to the coordinates of the button, to get the coordinates of the button move your mouse over the button and look at the bottom left hand corner of SCAR and there they are. its not hard i used to do this stuff when i was 14</p>

As for the login its extremly simple, if you would like to auto for the mean time add this to the start of the main loop.</p>

<p>change 321,123 to the coordinates of the click here to play button. Or if you want a more permanent solution use SRL[/quote]</p>
<p>What is SRL. Also I don’t know how to make scripts so I wouln’t know how to edit the script.</p>
