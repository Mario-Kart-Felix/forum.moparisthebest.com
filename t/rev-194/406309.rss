    <title>Rev 194</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rev-194/406309</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve been looking at a deob&#39;d 194 client (this was RuneScapes beta client), and I&#39;ve found a bit of a problem. No darn maps are in the cache. It has basically everything it needs but maps. I really don&#39;t want to load 317 maps, due to it not being a proper 194, and that it wouldn&#39;t work correctly (317 objects without the support).

So basically, has anyone got any ideas? Or the 194 maps (prob. impossible)?</description>
