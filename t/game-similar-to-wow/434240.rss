    <title>Game similar to WoW</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/game-similar-to-wow/434240</link>
    <description>I remember years ago my uncle had bought a game that was very similar to WoW but it was not online, it was single-player.

So.... does anyone know this game&#39;s name? I&#39;m hoping to buy it in time.</description>

So you won’t call your uncle because you haven’t seen him in a long time?  That should persuade you to call him even more…<br>

<p>It would be weird, imagine being an uncle who hasn’t heard from someone in a long time. Probably don’t even think about them. Then he calls up wanting you to remember something for him, and doesn’t call again for a long time.[/quote]<br>
I don’t really have anything to say to him, I’m not a talkative person.</p>

<p>Yeah, that would be weird.  But he could just call and talk, and then right before they say their goodbye’s, “Oh by the way, what was the name of that game you bought?”.</p>

Well your description narrows it down a bit.  I’ll just search through every purchase of every game store in the world, check if the person who bought it is an uncle, than find yours.  Brb- doing it.<br>

Wasn’t asking for anyone to search for it, just asking if anyone knew what it was.[/quote]</p>
<p>My reason for typing that last statement was to say that you don’t have enough information for anyone to make a reasonable guess.  Give information, or better yet, call your uncle and ask him.</p>

              <p>I remember years ago my uncle had bought a game that was very similar to WoW but it was not online, it was single-player.</p>
<p>So… does anyone know this game’s name? I’m hoping to buy it in time.</p>
