<pre><code>                               LORD OF THE FLIES ESSAY
                â€œ What is Ralph weeping for at the end of the story?â€
</code></pre>
<p>Every human has an inner demon that grows and feeds on his/her weakness, the evil with in us grows with out awareness. Once it grows it never dies it just feeds up on the anger and greed of us.</p>
<p>As in lord of the flies when Ralph was found by the navel officer after being in a viscous battle, he weeps for what has happen in the island. They started as a group as time went on being alone and away from civilization has caused them to forget about about manner and they started acting like barbarians. The act of being barbarians caused them to kill and to be monstrous.</p>
<p>When they started out the boys were in a pure mind as they started getting lonely and hungry the though of one should care about him self became in them, this caused the demon inside to feed upon them.</p>
<p>They started to kill for food when they were first to kill a living creature the human side of them came as they hesitated, but after going through hard times they forget about what is being human about. The boys only though about what they wanted they didnâ€™t care how they got it.</p>
<p>The killing of a mother pig to killing of human flesh. The boys started with a pig then with out them knowing they killed a human thinking it was a beast, but the beast was with in them all. The beast (demon) inside them grew as they became savages and hid reality from them.</p>
<p>The boys anger grew two rebels were created Jacks side versos Ralph where Jackâ€™s group was much stronger and with more boys. Ralph couldnâ€™t believe the blood thirst and vicious death of his close friend Piggy, who Ralph looked on to save the boys now he was gone. Ralph couldnâ€™t believe what have they became and what it has caused.</p>
<p>Ralph realizes that every human being has a beast (demon) with in them selves and it can cause chaos. Ralph remembers his dear friends Simon, Piggy and the boy who was burnt in the mountain top because of the boys fault for not caring about what their action may cause. As he weeps for the death and the nightmare that happen in the island, he leaves it all behind as the naval officer takes him to safety.</p>

        <pre><code> Okay first of all. The problem with most essays is that the content is disorganized. You may have great ideas and facts that you want to write about, but somewhere during the writing process you start mixing them up. Suddenly your perfect paper sounds all wrong and you want to scream! 

 What you need to do is have a good solid outline. Once you have an outline down, your paper writes itself. Your thoughts are organized and the teacher can understand your main point (which is your thesis) and how you supported that thesis. You need to be focused, and that is the key to writing a good essay.
</code></pre>
<p>This is a good outline format that they teach in school. I have been following this format and have had 98-100%’s on my essays.</p>
<p>I. Topic / Title</p>
<p>II. Introduction of Essay<br>
A. Grab the reader’s attention. Then write a few sentences (2 or 3) that lead into the main point of your essay<br>
B. End the paragraph with your thesis statement (3 main points you are going to support)<br>
1. First point in thesis<br>
2. Second point in thesis<br>
3. Third point in thesis</p>
<p>III. Body of Essay<br>
A. First Paragraph – First point in Thesis<br>
1. Support your point with either quotations or solid evidence<br>
2. Have at least five sentences<br>
B. Second Paragraph – Second point in Thesis<br>
1. Support your point with either quotations or solid evidence<br>
2. Have at least five sentences<br>
C. Third Paragraph - Third Point in Thesis<br>
1. Support your point with either quotations or solid evidence<br>
2. Have at least five sentences</p>
<p>IV. Conclusion<br>
A. Write a few sentences summarizing your essay<br>
B. Restate your thesis and how you proved your point</p>
<p>Here are some other pointers.</p>
<p>•	Don’t have run on sentences. Use commas and semicolons.</p>
<p>•	Don’t use the same words again and again.</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Sorry if I didn’t explain everything in great detail.</p>
