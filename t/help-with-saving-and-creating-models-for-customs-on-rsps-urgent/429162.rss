    <title>Help with Saving and Creating Models for Customs on Rsps [URGENT]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-saving-and-creating-models-for-customs-on-rsps-urgent/429162</link>
    <description>Hey, i have recently been experimenting with cinema 4d and realised that since it is a modelling software i should be able to make rsps customs on it like the other softwares out there. i.e metasequioa. 

I was wondering, what file extension would i have to save the model as so that i can transfer it to RsDatmaker.

thankyou very much.</description>
