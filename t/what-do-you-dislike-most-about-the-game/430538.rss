    <title>What do you dislike most about the game?</title>

    <description>What do you dislike the most about Runescape and/or Jagex?

To me, it&#39;s just the community.  It seems like I can&#39;t talk to anyone who doesn&#39;t seem to live in their own universe and thinks that they&#39;re the best in the game and when they loose a fight, they just go on a rampage saying how you cheated or Ddosed them or some shit.

This isn&#39;t a complaint or hate thread talking about how much I hate Jagex, I just want to know what people dislike about Runescape.</description>

Yes, however I’m beginning to loose faith that that will ever happen with some of the new programmers coming in.  All they do is leech a 2 year old source, make a PI, or ‘clean’ a source.  We don’t need anything cleaned, we need a decent developer team to write an actual stable base that will work.  Even if all you want to do is pk, you should at least show interest in the details and the beauty of the original game.</p>
<p>Also, I do agree that Jagex have made wrong turns, but I also feel the community pushed them into it in a way.  Every update they made, people would say “wow dude dis sht suks lolloololollolololo”.  Even if the update was good, people would still go on a selfish rampage on the forums asking for better content when it’s fine.  They never realized that they are the only ones that dislike it, and therefore the only ones who rant.  The 562 era was the time I knew the game would fail.</p>

I miss when having something like a fire cape was amazing and everyone was jealous of you, but now people just think of a fire cape as nothing now. Oh the joys of the new generation…</p>

<p>even in low, have you tryed updating your graphics card and java or getting a new graphics card somewhere? maybe clearing more space on your ram? such as disk clean-up, removing cookies, deleting folders and stuff that you don’t use anymore, removing programs you rarely use?</p>
<p>HMM… how about restore computer to factory settings! maybe that will solve it  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

              <p>A few things but mostly peoples constant complaints about the game. Every game has its downsides, games need to evolve and change if it doesn’t produce sequels like Rs if yous never knew. Staying the same is backwards, they may make bad updates but they make good ones too.</p>
<p>However, I don’t like how theres not a lot of combination requirements, there needs to be more rather than just making requirements for things high in one skill. An example of somewhere they succeeded in this was Korasi as you needed to do skills and quests rather than making it like 95 att req or some shit.</p>

<p>This. Not to mention I can’t even play on my computer anymore because the lag due to the graphics settings is so bad. Even on minimum. Granted my computer is shit and I’m not investing in a laptop for a few months. Also many, many pointless updates that completely unbalance the combat triangle. Jagex should have realized that bigger is not always better.</p>
