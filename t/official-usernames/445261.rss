    <description>Hey guys,


So, as I understand, the official Moparcraft server is a cracked one, yes? Meaning that anyone can use any username as chosen on these forums.

However, what is the policy if someone has taken a username, then the person who owns the genuine account turns up? Someone has registered and is playing the server under the name &quot;Flenix&quot; - an account I&#39;ve had since Alpha.

Now, generally I wouldn&#39;t care, but its Minecraft. In Minecraft, I&#39;m a server admin for over 18 months, I&#39;ve written plenty of plugins, designed a texture pack, I do hi-res skins for Spoutcraft... I just don&#39;t want people seeing this guy and thinking he is me is all. So is there any way to correct this?</description>

Unless you actually wish to play the Moparcraft server, I doubt we will address this. More to the point I cannot find a person registered to the name ‘Flenix’ on the forums, are you sure you are logging in correctly?<br>

<p>I couldn’t find one either, but I only registered today and it told me the username was taken in both places…[/quote]</p>
<p>If it’s a genuine issue where an inactive user has taken a legitimate person’s username, I’m sure we can make an arrangement to remove the inactive user’s minecraft name.</p>
