    <title>Question about signatures</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-about-signatures/401488</link>
    <description>Okay so somebody had messaged me saying that their signature was removed due to it advertising their programming services and suggested i did the same. I then passed the information on to somebody else.

I am curious now, what exactly are we allowed to put in our signatures? Are we allowed to put forums, advertising paid services, what?</description>
