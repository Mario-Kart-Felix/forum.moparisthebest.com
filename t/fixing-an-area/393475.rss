    <title>Fixing an area</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fixing-an-area/393475</link>
    <description>Well I was making a boss which requires noone else being in the area to kill,

now right now I have if player is blue (team) and player is not red (team) then die, or if player is red (team) and player is not blue (team) die.

Now what I want is that if there is a red player and blue player in the area he does not die, however he still dies.

How could I do this?</description>
