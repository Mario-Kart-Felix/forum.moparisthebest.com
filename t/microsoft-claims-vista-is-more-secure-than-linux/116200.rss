    <description>This has got to be the biggest amount of bullshit I have heard since my dad told me that I could fly without drugs. 

Here is the link to the article.

In my own experience, I&#39;ve gotten way more spyware and other shit while using XP than I did with Ubuntu, but I suppose to Microsoft, that&#39;s moot.</description>

<p>Anywho, Vista has nice security features(eg; driver signing), but, there are two large factors that are keeping me away from it: Microsofts past - security wise - is rather sketchy and the DRM mechanisms are rather, over the top. Regarding Windows XP security; SP2 for XP added lots of nice security features - and since then there have been no <em>major</em> worm outbreaks, prior to SP2 there were heaps eg; Mydoom, Sasser etc.</p>

<p>I believe that is one of the security problems in Windows he was referring to when he said that malicious code could only go so far in *nix. Privilege elevation remains horribly easy in Windows right up to XP (and I assume Vista too, although I haven’t had the chance or motivation to use Vista yet). Sure, Linux has had it’s fair share of kernel vulnerabilites and such like that allowed local escalation, but in Windows it’s practically a built-in feature of the operating system - whether the user who runs a program is running as Administrator or not, any program can do what the shit it likes with a few choice API calls.</p>

<p>Secunia - Microsoft Windows XP Home: 170 advisories, 27 still unpatched<br>

<p>How long has the Windows XP Home edition been around for? It’s been out longer than the latest version of Ubuntu. Windows XP Home has been around, according to Wikipedia, since <span class="bbcode-b">October 25, 2001</span>. 6 years ago, and their system gets a total of 170 advisories and they don’t even fix all of them! How incompetent or complacent are they?</p>
<p>Monopolies stop caring. That’s the biggest problem with all monopolies. Once they get so high that it’s hard for any company to knock down, it’s as if they are unstoppable. Microsoft would be the number one example, but another would be AT&amp;T which was split up after they were sued by the United States. How about Carnegies Steel company and Rockefellers Standard Oil company. Old companies, but they were still monopolies, and they both charged high prices and people were forced to pay them because everyone needed gas for cars and steel for railroads and many other things.</p>
<p>If Microsoft looses as much market share to Linux as they have to Firefox, Microsoft would start improving their Operating System. Just like they improved IE by using the same features Firefox, Opera, Konqueror, and many other browsers have. Also, like how they emulated some of the same features as Apple computers in Microsoft Vista.</p>
<p>Here’s an interesting article titled <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1952606,00.asp" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">When Microsoft-Lovers Base Microsoft</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of the problems are in third-party software, not actual Microsoft products.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If Microsoft was as secure as Linux, the third-party software would never be insecure. Take for example the new way to exploit firefox.<br>
<a href="http://secunia.com/advisories/25984/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://secunia.com/advisories/25984/</a></p>
<p>It’s a bug in Firefox and bug in MS/IE that creates a security threat for Firefox. If MS/IE was more secure, Firefox wouldn’t even have to bother to fix the problem. In Linux, you do not have to worry about security as much when developing a program. You just focus on whatever your program should do, and then do it. Other than that, it’s no worries at all.</p>

              <p>Can we blame it all on Microsoft though? What about programs that have Security holes in them. They were developed for windows, and were not open source. People exploited those vulnerabilities, does that make Microsoft responsible? Or is it that, that chart is only the OS itself.</p>

              <p>Well viruses have been developed for Linux, the problem is that Linux has so many security precautions setup that the virus (if made) can only go so far. Someone made one virus called .bliss or something just to show that Linux is not that secure. Though once found, the virus was fixed within a few weeks.</p>
<p>Plus, people get the wrong idea when they think if the OS/program has a greater market share, then new security holes will be found and exploited. Quite the contrary, if the market share is greater, there will be more developers, and the new security holes will be found and fixed.</p>
<p>There were lots of polls done where they showed that a problem in Microsoft wasn’t fixed in 300++ days (324 or something, I forget) and then they checked with a problem found on Linux and it was fixed within a few weeks to a month.</p>
