    <title>2h and shields. Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2h-and-shields-help/178758</link>
    <description>Ok, i&#39;ve searched and have not found the answer to my question.

I can make it, if i&#39;m wearing a shield and use a 2h, and shield is removed, that bit was easy. But, i can put a shield back on after, and here is my problem.

So if anyone knows how i can make it so i cannot equip a shield, or the weapon is removed once a shield is added, i would be very very grateful!

Thanks in advance, too whoever can help me :)
