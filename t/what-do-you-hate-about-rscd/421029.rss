    <description>Please list things that you disagree with within the RSCD and RSCD based servers, such as RSCA, EasyRSC, DarkQuest, etc.

What do you think could be improved?</description>

              <p>The following is written in the order that I came to think about them - and not in the order of importance:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What CodeForFame said, it has high coupling (and possibly low cohesion). It should be the other way around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lack of a Domain Model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lack of general and conceptual abstractions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Too many circular package dependencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not very efficient to use a single “World” class the way it’s currently done. You could use a single “World” class as the contract, but hide the implementation details. You could use Buckets, Areas, Regions or anything similar for implementation details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why keep external dependencies in the main code? Why not come up with an abstraction and use a Facade or Adapter as implementation? Apache MINA comes to mind. Think of external dependencies and their respective projects as if they were supported a shorter period of time than your own. This usually isn’t the case here, but if it was, what would you do if you needed a bug fixed and noone would fix it? Change to something else? Maybe. If so, perhaps you should make it easy to do that change from the start? I think so! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lot of the classes (especially in RSCA) show implementation details that should have been kept hidden. Just run Javadoc on the source and you’ll see what I mean (well, if you understand what I mean, that is). To fix, just go over all fields, constructors and methods and set their respective access modifiers to the most restrictive one that is still possible. The “public” and “protected” access modifiers tells you it belongs to the contract of the class- or interface type. If they’re “private” or “” (package protected), they’re implementation details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prefer to have as many classes “final”. Also favor immutability over its opposite (mutability). This makes it easier to ensure no other class changes the internal state of the immutable class. Plus, it’ll make it suitable for concurrent use, without external synchronization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write Javadocs for the contracts of the class- or interface types (packages, types, fields, constructors and methods). You can write comments for the implementation details aswell, but that’s not as important - I usually don’t do that myself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On a side note: Almost everything described above are as applicable to RSCDEF-based servers and Geminus-based servers, as it is to RSCD-based servers.</p>
