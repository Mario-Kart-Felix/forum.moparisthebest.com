    <title>Res Issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/res-issue/446469</link>
    <description>I smell foul play.
Im 100% sure I renewed my rez in W1 two weeks ago with the command /res lease renew.

I only bring it up cause I log off for 1/2 an hour and The hybrids loot every chest I have and led all my live stock out. 
To do this they would have to have many players or trips to help as I had alot of chests that were full. This would have had to start the second I logged off with my rez intact.
Is there a way that the rez could be modified or tampered with or an addon that could break it?
Im more worried that they can break rez&#39;s now then I care about my loot.</description>

Punish players that have broken rules blatantly or let them piss on the rules?</p>
<p>as I said before, I would have dished out the same punishment if they have done the same to any other player.</p>
<p>On the eve of advertising for new players should you not want to follow to the rules to the letter? by not doing this you will now have to deal with way more garbage reports and people bitching. It should be as simple as (Rules broken= punishment )<br>
By not banning them you send out a message that the rules are not real rules and they can do whatever they want.<br>
As you said  “I want to encourage a better community” and I don’t think players that do this kind of activity promote this type of play.</p>
<p>And yes I will wage a war with them, as a player that is how I play. Do bad to me I will fight back 10 fold. This will not end well.</p>

<p>I know you think “waging war” makes you look tough and teaches them a lesson, but it really doesn’t, all you’re really doing is inflaming the situation and making my inbox bigger when people complain about it.

The ban should stay if not be longer.<br>
1: They greifed all my piston doors, not just the stone but all the pistons and red stone as well. Only after the ban was n the table did they offer to repair any damage.<br>
2: They Killed or removed all my live stock.<br>
3: They did this to a staff member, some one who is there to help them and deal with their bullshit. Even if my rez was to expire they could have warned me, instead the took EVERY item in every chest and stripped them bare. Not even my bones were left.</p>
<p>What type of message does this send that players can blatantly abuse rules in place with no repercussion. A two week ban is very small I don’t see how that was excessive. They clearly knew the rules as the first thing they did was shout them back at me.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the WAR the will now in sue will be nothing but bitching from them as I will not back down. Every moment spent in the game I will hunt them as they have now proven to be “capable” players that want a war.</p>

<p>I understand you feel a little cheated in losing your stuff, but you have to accept that sometimes stuff doesn’t always go to plan whether the mistake was made on your end or not. The bottom line is this: We can’t ban people without proper investigation for bug abuse. I know you’ve said that the current ban isn’t for the potential bug abuse, but for the rules they have broken, now I’m going to be honest when I say this but you and I both know they haven’t broken sufficient amount of rules to be banned for 2 weeks.</p>
<p>No matter how much you say them stealing all your stuff doesn’t bother you, I know it does. It would both anybody. Until Moparisthebest comes on and checks the server logs a 2 week ban is off the table. We need to be helping our playerbase grow, and to do that we need to avoid conflicts such as these.</p>
<p>Also, the next time you ban somebody please don’t use /ban ingame but instead use the forum function that was added:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php?action=moderate;area=viewgroups;sa=members;group=86" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php?action=moderate;area=viewgroups;sa=members;group=86</a></p>
<p>It’s a lot more convenient for the other staff members  :rolleyes:</p>

              <p>The ban is for the rules that were broken. Had nothing to do with me being mad, I told them every reason they wer banned I would have done it jsut the same if it wasent me that was looted.<br>
Its only for 2 weeks. I wanted to make it a few months.</p>
<p>This post is for the issue how or why the res was faulted. not for their ban.</p>

              <p>They don’t really deserve to be banned, we are going to have to wait for Moparisthebest to look into it before anything can be proven as far as exploits go. I understand your frustration however I’ve lost all my stuff twice due to bugs/exploits.</p>

              <p>I smell foul play.<br>
Im 100% sure I renewed my rez in W1 two weeks ago with the command /res lease renew.</p>
<p>I only bring it up cause I log off for 1/2 an hour and The hybrids loot every chest I have and led all my live stock out.<br>
To do this they would have to have many players or trips to help as I had alot of chests that were full. This would have had to start the second I logged off with my rez intact.<br>
Is there a way that the rez could be modified or tampered with or an addon that could break it?<br>
Im more worried that they can break rez’s now then I care about my loot.</p>
