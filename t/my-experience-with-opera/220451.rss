    <title>My experience with Opera:</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-experience-with-opera/220451</link>
    <description>It&#39;s a piece of shit. All you people saying it&#39;s better than Firefox are clearly basing your opinion on the Acid3 test results or some shit that dosen&#39;t matter. I decided to install Opera on this laptop as it&#39;s not the most high spec in the world and Firefox is a bit of a resource whore. It&#39;s been installed 3 days, and yes, it&#39;s a bit faster and more responsive. However:

+ It randomly crashes while watching flvs, which I do quite often. I have no idea what causes this, dosen&#39;t seem related to anything, just randomly happens, don&#39;t even get an error message it just bails to the desktop.

+ Sometimes the UI will just randomly stop responding for like, a minute. Again, no idea what causes it, just happens like every 20 minutes or so.

+ Pretty much everytime I go to close a tab, it closes the one next to it as well.

+ The most annoying: Like, 1 out of 5 times i click a link, the link dosen&#39;t open, and then Opera enters some kind of &quot;i hate you&quot; phase where no links will work until I close that tab and reopen it again.

In short, Opera fans, your browser fucking sucks, now stop telling me it&#39;s better than Firefox.

PS: Oh, I forgot, the built-in chat client and torrent client are the worst piece of shit ever invented.</description>

<p>The truth is that when software becomes more popular there is a greater crowd of people trying to find exploits and exploiting what they find. You can see this is true because Firefox has a greater user-base compared to Opera, and we can see this has happened in the past with Internet Explorer. (Although Internet Explorer was a bunch of balls anyway).[/quote]<br>
Opera fix Secury holes faster than Firefox guys.</p>
<p>If you seen the difference about Windows and Linux/Mac you see that Windows big userbase is not the only reason that is a piece of crap, Its much easier for a virus to get access to the system on an Admin account than on Linux since you don’t need any password to do anything, but on Linux (Or at least Ubuntu) you need password to even change the clock.</p>
<p>Opera and Firefox is better and more secure than Internett Explorer even if They got 99.9% of the market share. They are build more secure than IE.</p>

Never happened to me

I leave mine open with at least 15 tabs at a time pretty much all the time without closing it, its fine for me.

?????

One thing i'll agree on, it usually works fine though for me.
<p>(Oh and no i’m not basing my opinions ont he acid3 test, infact i’ve never done it on opera yet).</p>

              <p>It’s a piece of shit. All you people saying it’s better than Firefox are clearly basing your opinion on the Acid3 test results or some shit that dosen’t matter. I decided to install Opera on this laptop as it’s not the most high spec in the world and Firefox is a bit of a resource whore. It’s been installed 3 days, and yes, it’s a bit faster and more responsive. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It randomly crashes while watching flvs, which I do quite often. I have no idea what causes this, dosen’t seem related to anything, just randomly happens, don’t even get an error message it just bails to the desktop.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, Opera fans, your browser fucking sucks, now stop telling me it’s better than Firefox.</p>
<p>PS: Oh, I forgot, the built-in chat client and torrent client are the worst piece of shit ever invented.</p>
