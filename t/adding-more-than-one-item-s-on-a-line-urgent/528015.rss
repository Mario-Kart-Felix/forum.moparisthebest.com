    <title>Adding more than one item(s) on a line? URGENT :&#39;(</title>

    <description>Dear People of MoparScape,

I have a serious problem, it might be a dumb one, but a serious problem.

So it all started out when I thought to myself, hmmm I need to make some Donor packages, so I set off to making one. It&#39;s extremely simple, but I got too lazy to keep doing [code]c.getItem().addItem(###, #)[/code], so I started doing arrayOfItems. Although, when I compile, I have everything right... But, the arrayofItems variable cannot be found, or as stated in the compiler, cannot find symbol: variable arrayOfItems

Please help me :&#39;(

EDIT: Nevermind, I put in a public int for the client and called back the items from the ClickItem.java HOWEVER, I still keep disconnecting after using the box!</description>
