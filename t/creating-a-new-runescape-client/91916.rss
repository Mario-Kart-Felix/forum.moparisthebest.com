    <title>Creating a new Runescape client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-a-new-runescape-client/91916</link>
    <description>Alright, I just took an exam in my AP Computer Science class, and my teacher assigned me a free-form project to do, and we&#39;re allowed to program anything. SO, I decided upon programming a new runescape client (if this is possible). I&#39;m going to learn what I can from the code of some of the clients I&#39;ve downloaded, and then program in C. However, to make it interesting, I&#39;ll be programming for the Nintendo DS :)

So far, I&#39;ve been able to get that I need to start up a socket to the server @ it&#39;s port, and send the number 16 (which says &quot;I want to play&quot;), then send the number of your client version. I&#39;ve taken a look around the forums, and I&#39;m not really sure about some things. What is Deobfuscating? Also, why do I need a cache, what&#39;s it&#39;s importance? Also, do you think it&#39;s possible to program a client in C? Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!  :D</description>

              <p>well if you really want to make a client for the DS you need to know some hardware things, such as it’s specs like processing power, and it’s RAM. I would suggest using a pass-thru thing to get to a compact flash or SD card that is in the GBA socket.</p>
<p>3-D: With the newly developed graphics engine, DS can reproduce impressive 3-D renderings that can surpass images displayed on the Nintendo 64. Games will run at 60 frames per second, and allow details like fog effects and cel shading.</p>
<p>Sound: The 16-channel sound allows for greatly expanded use of voices and music, and a richer, more immersive game experience. A plug for headphones transmits stereo sound.</p>
<p>Processing: The unit will run on two processors, one ARM9 one ARM7.</p>
<p>DS Display Dimensions / Timings<br>
Dot clock = 5.585664 MHz (=33.513982 MHz / 6)<br>
H-Timing: 256 dots visible, 99 dots blanking, 355 dots total (15.7343KHz)<br>
V-Timing: 192 lines visible, 71 lines blanking, 263 lines total (59.8261 Hz)<br>
The V-Blank cycle for the 3D Engine consists of the 23 lines, 191…213.<br>
Screen size 62.5mm x 47.0mm (each) (256x192 pixels)<br>
Vertical space between screens 22mm (equivalent to 90 pixels)</p>
<p><a href="http://doc.kodewerx.net/documents/gbatek.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">check here for more information</a></p>
<p>just remember your power and memory is extreamly limited, even Diddy Kong Racing froze just because it went about 210 bytes over the amount possible. Unless you figure out how to do a Live memory Swap like Linux on the DS with a FAT system, you might be able to get a little complex with things.</p>

<p>Not really (as far as I know). If you want to make a functional client, you’ll have to work with RS2. There <span class="bbcode-i">are</span> an awful lot of RS2 private servers you can test against, though. I’d actually start that way, now that I think about it - doing your initial development against the real servers will probably just start banning characters.</p>

<p>If it was easy, one would think there would already be detailed public documentation about the current runescape protocol and a working program to connect to the server without using a modified client. But apparently, there is not.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The basics are almost common knowledge among the people who work with the client. Once you start looking at the code, the protocol is fairly apparent. It’s a fair bet that anyone in our little group who would want to make a packet bot already knows a good deal and could figure out the rest, so there hasn’t really been a need for documentation. I’ll admit that this doesn’t account for people like the OP, but nothing defines this community quite so much as lack of spontaneous motivation - and let’s just say that a dedicated, skilled newcomer is a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>Since a lot of us are holdovers from Classic or at least early RS2, we’ve seen packet bots before and we’ve watched Jagex build security designed to prevent them. It’s not terribly complicated to start a connection. It is complicated to build a game state and respond to it correctly without using the client. It would take even more work to do so undetectably. Then you have the updates to contend with if you hope to use your system longer than a week or two at the outside. That’s why <span class="bbcode-i">we</span> don’t bother. But if you’ve got a different motivation - like the OP - and you’re not just looking for an efficient cheating system at minimum effort, then a packet bot would be cool. I’d like to see one started, and even more to see one finished.</p>

<p>Those few lines of code that you posted are just a small part of an RSA encryption scheme, and it is in no way enough to emulate it without further analysis of the current client.</p>

<p>That really is the core of it. Unless you’re talking about the entire login process, I suggest you take a look at<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA#Operation" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA#Operation</a> - the beauty of RSA is that it’s 90% math, 10% code.</p>

<p>Though it is nice that you have such a high confidence either in yourself or in the person willing to do this for a class mark, I consider that it is important that that person understands that this is no easy task, so that he can choose with full knowledge of what he’s getting into.

<p>Such documentation as there is may be found at <a href="http://rscd.eggsampler.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://rscd.eggsampler.com</a> (but that’s only for Classic)<br>
I totally agree about the amount of work that <span class="bbcode-i">finishing</span> this would be. I know I don’t have the motivation for it. But he’s said that he doesn’t actually have to complete the program, just get started on it and make some things work. As for help- if he asks questions, I’m sure they’ll be answered.</p>
<p>edit: That wasn’t long-winded at all.</p>

If it was easy, one would think there would already be detailed public documentation about the current runescape protocol and a working program to connect to the server without using a modified client. But apparently, there is not. Those few lines of code that you posted are just a small part of an RSA encryption scheme, and it is in no way enough to emulate it without further analysis of the current client. Though it is nice that you have such a high confidence either in yourself or in the person willing to do this for a class mark, I consider that it is important that that person understands that this is no easy task, so that he can choose with full knowledge of what he’s getting into. I know you have more experience with the client deobbing than I do, but you have more experience than he does too, so unless you’re willing to help him (which would be nice, btw, I dont think I’ve ever seen proper documentation about the rs protocol) with the encryption and login packets, I think that he would better be ready for some difficulties.</p>

              <p>Well if you switched back to an old enough RS classic version you could copy Autorune, but would kinda be cheating. Using C++, Java or C shouldn’t be too important, so I would just use the one I liked the most. About the big integer stuff, to see what is going on, I would probably try to find the login area in a deob, and trace from there with a java debugger and Wireshark. However, I suppose someone here has done this kind of research already, so they probably could give better advice at that respect.</p>
<p>About the Autorune source, I never knew it was public. Pwnd, or someone else, can you please post a link to the public autorune source code?

<p>And yeah, I know since Aryan there have not been any good modified client bots (that the general public knows about, at least). I was just using bot in a wide sense: third party program that interacts with the runescape servers.</p>

              <p>zstars is wrong on one point that actually makes your project easier. You don’t have to break anything - the client’s key and modulus are readily available in the source, and with those your program’s connection should be no different from the client’s connection. Just look for the BigIntegers. In the same vein, reversing the protocol is <span class="bbcode-i">much</span> simpler when you look at the client rather than (or in addition to) watching packet streams. RuneScape decompiles quite nicely, unlike those native games.</p>
<p>AutoRune’s source was made semi-public, as was the SCAR source of the same time. It’s very old and was designed for RuneScape classic in the first place - you’d be better off not basing your work on it. Actually, the last thing I heard about RSDemon indicated that it was also a packet bot. Someone by the name of RedLizard (I think) wrote an RS-login program in C back on Kaitnieks, but I don’t know if it would still work since I haven’t looked at the source since then, nor do I know if the login process has changed at all with the new engine.</p>

              <p>Your teacher won’t be able to start seeing progress easily. Getting started is probably the hardest part. (Well, and maintaining it too). Most bots which do connect to Runescape are modified clients, which have been deobbed and decompiled. In fact there has only been one Runescape packet bot, and that was Autorune. Sadly, its source never went public. In any case, to get started, you will probably have to first break the encryption.</p>
<p>Runescape encrypts the login packet using RSA. I’m not 100% on any of this, as I have not checked myself, but I think that a CRC or other hash of the runescape cache is also sent encrypted, so that the server can check that the cache is unmodified.<br>
Probably, at this step the seed for the ISAAC random number generator is also sent.</p>
<p>Most packets are supposed to not be encrypted. Their op-codes, however, are encrypted using a synchronized ISAAC random number generator. That way, if the server and client share the same seed, the numbers it will generate will be the same. If the bot or a potential proxy-bot isn’t running a generator using the same seed, however, it will be unable to know what the op-code of each packet is, and especially, it will be unable to insert a packet. After breaking the RSA encryption, you will have to deal with this. You can do that by finding how exactly this system works, so that you can get get or write your own ISAAC generator, to emulate the real client’s.</p>
<p>If you manage to do all that, one of the hardest parts will be done. The rest is basically just a lot of work, sniffing packets and reversing the client till you know the protocol and have documented enough different packets so that you can emulate a real client.</p>
<p>Note that, although it’s not really an encryption, strings are also compressed. I’ve been trying to find the algorithm to decompress them myself.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you finally decide to try this I hope you keep us informed, as I am really interested in this myself <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
If you need some help I will try to answer, my experience with Runescape is very limited but I have worked on packets on games such as Diablo II or Starwars Galaxies.</p>

<p>I don’t have to finish the project to get a good grade, my teacher just wants to see progress (So, there is no time limit). And I think I’m going to take a look at the bots and see how they connect / etcetera. I’ll also look over the source of the client and see what I can find out.</p>

              <p>It shouldn’t be that hard to emulate the RuneScape client well enough to access the game. You can rip the protocol classes straight out of the client along with the necessary large primes. The problem is that they <span class="bbcode-i">do</span> randomly change things. In the past they’ve added random packets and for <span class="bbcode-i">years</span> they’ve changed the header IDs with each version. I remember some discussions from a while back that they might even be changing payload structure or endianness now. So it’s the interpretation that gets you.</p>
<p>No one does it because there’s no reason to. It would take a horrible amount of work to make a clientless system that undetectably handles every possible game state in the correct manner. And since it’s impossible to play the game normally with a clientless system, the only purpose for having one would be botting (and yet, I would love to see someone write an RSMUD client just to prove me wrong :P). Since avoiding detection would be such a massive (not to mention recurrent) task, people avoid packet bots now. Near-instant detectability is generally a Bad Thing in a bot.</p>
<p>Don’t misunderstand - I can definitely envision a pattern recognition tool to handle the packet updates for you. I just wouldn’t want to write it myself, nor would I want to map the game logic attached to each packet.<br>
I certainly wouldn’t try it for a time-limited project with a grade attached.</p>
<p>I like semaphore’s suggestion of an amusing agent. If your CS class has used Robocode, I’d write an agent (with some kind of sneaky installer) that would open the controls of other bots to yours. Then I’d just have my bot sit there, doing silent damage to the others.</p>

good to see the Jagex FUD team is out in full force.</p>
<p>Dont listen to these people that say it is impossible it may take you a year or more to do but it is possible.<br>

<p>ruler, some day, when someone actually cares, they will put you in your place. The problem is, no one cares about your meaningless thoughts. What is truly sad is that you don’t realize how much all of us that actually <span class="bbcode-i">have</span> done something great laugh at even the mention of you. When I said you are insignificant, I meant it in the most heartfelt way. In the circles that have done things that you couldn’t even imagine let alone code, your name is synonymous with arrogance and ignorance all wrapped into one.</p>
<p>I know you <span class="bbcode-i">don’t care</span> what other people think. You attack me for being right. I am right. I have never mentioned anything on the forums that has not been right. When I said they were monitoring mouse packets and that the flag was on for everyone. I was right. You have yet to prove that wrong yet you spew arrogant and ignorant venom.</p>
<p>Keep bringing on the venom though, it just proves my theory that the ones that cannot, attack the ones that have.[/quote]<br>
I wanna be uberleet like semaphore <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
