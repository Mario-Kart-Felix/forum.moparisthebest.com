    <title>Oh no. Character Problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/oh-no-character-problems/41878</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know what version of what I&#39;m running as a server (I&#39;m a temp host, he turned everything to &quot;Blackscape&quot;, argh), but anyway.

I locked myself out of my character with an invalid item! I&#39;m not really a Java programmer (C/C++, actually), so I don&#39;t know where to do to unlock myself. I tried compiling after editing those txt files in characters\, no luck. Here&#39;s the item:

character-item = 0	8566	1

I tell ya now not to pick that item up.

Where would I put a code like this:

					// Paril, maybe exception? I found item that kills the game!
					for (int n = 0; n &lt; players[i].playerInventory.length; n++)
					{
						if (players[i].playerInventory[n] == 8566) // This item
						{
							players[i].playerInventory[n] = 0;					
							System.out.printIn (&quot;Found item that crashes on &quot;+players[i].playerName+&quot;!&quot;);
						}
					}
