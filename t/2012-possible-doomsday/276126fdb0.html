<p>Why is that defying physics?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Well the closest planet that can support human life is 20.5 Lightyears away.<br>
There is a distance of 18906125715776453830.32 meters between earth and it.  Now we have in the last 50 years broken the sound barrier which is 340.29 m/s.  Now the speed of light is 299792458m/s and we’re far off from that. Now v=s/t which would mean we’d have to travel at a speed of 236326571447205672.87 m/y for 80 years.  That’s also equal to 7493866420.82m/s or 26977919114.97 km/h.</p>
<p>Sorry I orginally made a mistake in the measurement it was a simple mistake that is fixed up now.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure that by the time the human race has achieved such a speed they would probably be looking at ways to expand the suns lifespan or moving earth out past jupiter so in the transformation of the sun the earth isn’t wiped out.  Also it’d be pretty unlikely that by the time we can travel over 11 trililion times the speed of light we wouldn’t also have countless colonies on other planets in our solarsystem.</p>
<p>Not to mention that by that time the human race would have evolved dramatically as for this kind of advancement we’re probably looking for at least a hundred thousand years.  Also by that time the human race would have most likely united and based pretty much everything on logic and not emotion, this is because if that does not happen we would likely wipe ourselves out way before we’re even looking at developing a space ship/station that can travel at lightspeed.</p>
<p>I doubt our kind will survive more than another thousand years, though our advancements in technology are huge we’re still being held back by morons whom of which just happen to be “leaders” in our society.</p>
<p>Yer your right it doesn’t defy physics but I was using it as a figure of speech since when you look at it logically it makes no sense at all and physically it doesn’t seem possible.[/quote]</p>
<p>You definitely need to watch more Star Trek.</p>
<p>It sounds quite far fetched at the moment, I know. But humans in our current form have existed for millions of years. Our technology ‘level’ has grown rapidly over the last 100 years. Before 1900, people thought that going faster then 50km/u would kill you. Now, we are traveling faster then the speed of sound. Let’s assume that the sun stays in its current form for 4 billion years. I doubt we won’t be able to create Star Trek like ships to move to other galaxies. Once we build a base on the moon, we won’t need a huge amount of power to lift off. So we can build a huge ship on the moon, and take off from there.</p>
<p>18.906.125.715.776.453 Km is quite a long journey, but (again, using the 4 billion years) it’s only 4726531,43 Km a year. 12949,40 a day, and 539,56 Km per hour. Using centrifugal force around planets, you can probably reach over 10.000Km per hour (that’s a bad estimate I guess).</p>
<p>There are only two problems in my eyes: paying for/transferring supplies to the moon, and creating a gravitational field so our bodies don’t get fucked up.</p>

<p>Don’t you read what I say properly?</p>
<p>You completely ignored this part of my post:</p>
<blockquote>I'm pretty sure that by the time the human race has achieved such a speed they would probably be looking at ways to expand the suns lifespan or moving earth out past jupiter so in the transformation of the sun the earth isn't wiped out.  Also it'd be pretty unlikely that by the time we can travel over 11 trililion times the speed of light we wouldn't also have countless colonies on other planets in our solarsystem.

<p>I doubt our kind will survive more than another thousand years, though our advancements in technology are huge we’re still being held back by morons whom of which just happen to be “leaders” in our society.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also you say</p>
<blockquote>12949,40 a day, and 539,56 Km per hour. Using centrifugal force around planets, you can probably reach over 10.000Km per hour</blockquote>
<p>Well you did your calculations wrong, look at the amounts I used, they’re proper calculations.</p>
<p>The main problem I see is that for us to achieve such huge technological advancements the human race would need to stop conflicting with one another and the only way to do that is to scrap all beliefs and have everyone be logical.  Pretty much when or if this is possible will the human race be the same or will it be entirely different from we perceive it today.</p>
<p>Also this is ignoring the fact that the human race would also change physically and become better adapted to its society over 4 billion years.</p>

if so, it would be cool if like, something that has to do with the cosmos, everyone got super powers and could transform into different animals, i would be all like “ZOMGWTFBBQ I CAN TRANSFORM IN2 WOLF NAO OLOLOL BARK”<br>
and then i could possibly explain that i am a furry.<br>
and my brother would be like, “ZOMG UR GHEY UR A FURRY IMA PUNCH U 4 NO REASON @ ALL”<br>
and i’ll be all liek, “ZOMFGWTF I BITE U N U CNT MAKE FUN OF OTHER PEOPLE CUZ U R STOOPID”<br>

<p>But some scientists believe that once you hit the speed of light you reach your destination instantaneously, it’s just reaching the speed of light which makes this difficult to test <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

a light year is the distance light travels in a year.  at light speed 20.5 lightyears would take 20.5 years to travel.</p>

<p>But some scientists believe that once you hit the speed of light you reach your destination instantaneously, it’s just reaching the speed of light which makes this difficult to test ;)[/quote]My head hurts… but isn’t that “instantanious” feeling just because when you’re at the speed of light; time stops?</p>

<p>Don’t you read what I say properly?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I completely understood what you said. What I mean is, that even if we didn’t care about colonizing other planets, we could get a ship to travel the distance you stated within the time frame you gave.</p>
<blockquote>[b]or moving earth out past jupiter[/b] so in the transformation of the sun the earth isn't wiped out. </blockquote>
<p>What I wonder is, why would you want to move earth? You say that in a few thousand years everyone will think logical, and without emotions. It would be logical to abandon earth, and settle somewhere else. Taking earth with us would be a decision based on emotions.</p>
<blockquote>Also by that time the human race would have most likely united and based pretty much everything on logic and not emotion, this is because if that does not happen we would likely wipe ourselves out way before we're even looking at developing a space ship/station that can travel at lightspeed.</blockquote> 
<p>I agree, logic should be the base of our decisions. But it will take several generations to reach that point where we can safely say that emotion didn’t have influence on our decisions. We stick to religion, nationality, language, skin colour, the feeling of being different from our neighbors and even gender.</p>
<blockquote>I doubt our kind will survive more than another thousand years, though our advancements in technology are huge we're still being held back by morons whom of which just happen to be "leaders" in our society.</blockquote>
<p>Socialism is that what is keeping us from evolving. With socialism I don’t literally mean the political version of spreading wealth, but caring for people that shouldn’t be cared for. It may sound harsh, but people with born disabilities shouldn’t be stimulated to stay alive. Or that odd thing you see in movies: our ‘hero’ saves the love of his/her live at the risk off thousands.</p>
<p>The political version of Socialism aides this. I’m not saying that a free market is great, but do you really think that giving money to people that didn’t care to spend some time getting a proper education, and now have a crappy job, should be a good thing to do? On the other hand, people that don’t have a chance should be given an opportunity for their kids to get a proper education. But that means that the kids can’t live with their parents anymore. You see a lot of family’s in ghetto’s abusing their kids in such a way that the children don’t care about anything anymore.</p>
<blockquote>Also you say 
[quote]12949,40 a day, and 539,56 Km per hour. Using centrifugal force around planets, you can probably reach over 10.000Km per hour[/quote]
<p>Well you did your calculations wrong, look at the amounts I used, they’re proper calculations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you show me where I made a mistake? I calculated it like this:</p>
<p>18.906.125.715.776.453Km divided by 4.000.000.000 years = 4726531,42894411325 Km a year<br>
4726531,42894411325Km/Year divided by 365 days/year = 12949,40117518935136986301369863Km a day<br>
12949,40117518935136986301369863Km/day divided by 24 hours/day = 539,55838229955630707762557077626Km an hour</p>

        <p>Well, what actually happens is time dilates around you as your speed increases. So everything thats not travelling at the speed of light with you will age at normal time, but you will not age at all. Scientists discovered this when they sent 2 atomic clocks up to different altitudes + flew them at different speeds, they were set to EXACTLY the same time when the aircrafts took off, but when the aircraft then went higher + faster came back its clock was slightly behind because time slowed down for the specific aircraft.</p>

Some states that if you reach the speed of light the time will not go(Around you except your self) when you are moving, therefore it will seems like your travel is instant.<br>
Will give a source soon.</p>

        <p>People think the world is going to end in 2012 because the Mayan calender ends in 2012…<br>
The Mayan’s made that calender thousands and thousands of years ago… Don’t you think that they just stopped at that date because the list was too long? I mean they could have ended it in 2020 and people would say oh no world will end in 2020…</p>
<p>Also another theory I heard from my cousin was that (if you want to stop do it now this will be a long post)<br>
Anyway another theory my cousin told me was that this weird new planet that was recently discovered by scientists. Apparently this newly discovered planet is going to come into our atmosphere in 2012 and switch our north and south poles completely around and it’s going to cause all of these natural disasters such as tsunami’s and hurricane’s etc.<br>
BUT THERE IS HOPE FOR THE WORLD JUST YET!<br>
Apparently the Europeans of something have been working on this weird thingamajig for like 48 years that will switch our poles around without the natural disasters. WHICH MEANS that if they successfully finish it on time we will switch our poles unharmed and then when the planet comes into our atmosphere it will switch it back to normal AND YAY WE SAVED THE WORLD FROM ENDING! OO OO WAIT NOW THE WORLD IS GONNA END IN 2015 BECAUSE SOME HOBO ON THE STREET SAID THAT IT WOULD!</p>
<p>Basicly what I am saying after this long post is that all of this world ending stuff is complete bullshit.<br>
Oh sorry one more thing I would like to point out while I am at this, people also said that the world was gonna end in the year 2000 because all of the computers were gonna crash thus sending all nuclear warheads off and planes crashing to the ground equaling total death for all. Just wait and watch when it comes to the day, I am gonna be kicking back in my chair having a beer and then when the day is over there is gonna be another thread on moparisthebest saying HAHA I TOLD ALL OF YOU FUCKERS THAT YOU WERE WRONG!</p>

ur dumb<br>
the poles are supposed to switch every few 99999 years, and apparently its supposed to switch some time near 2012<br>
also the poles of the sun switch<br>
also on that date the sun is in the middle of our galaxy, not sure what the significance is though</p>

People think the world is going to end in 2012 because the Mayan calender ends in 2012…<br>
The Mayan’s made that calender thousands and thousands of years ago… Don’t you think that they just stopped at that date because the list was too long? I mean they could have ended it in 2020 and people would say oh no world will end in 2020…</p>
<p>Also another theory I heard from my cousin was that (if you want to stop do it now this will be a long post)<br>
Anyway another theory my cousin told me was that this weird new planet that was recently discovered by scientists. Apparently this newly discovered planet is going to come into our atmosphere in 2012 and switch our north and south poles completely around and it’s going to cause all of these natural disasters such as tsunami’s and hurricane’s etc.<br>
BUT THERE IS HOPE FOR THE WORLD JUST YET!<br>
Apparently the Europeans of something have been working on this weird thingamajig for like 48 years that will switch our poles around without the natural disasters. WHICH MEANS that if they successfully finish it on time we will switch our poles unharmed and then when the planet comes into our atmosphere it will switch it back to normal AND YAY WE SAVED THE WORLD FROM ENDING! OO OO WAIT NOW THE WORLD IS GONNA END IN 2015 BECAUSE SOME HOBO ON THE STREET SAID THAT IT WOULD!</p>
<p>Basicly what I am saying after this long post is that all of this world ending stuff is complete bullshit.<br>
Oh sorry one more thing I would like to point out while I am at this, people also said that the world was gonna end in the year 2000 because all of the computers were gonna crash thus sending all nuclear warheads off and planes crashing to the ground equaling total death for all. Just wait and watch when it comes to the day, I am gonna be kicking back in my chair having a beer and then when the day is over there is gonna be another thread on moparisthebest saying HAHA I TOLD ALL OF YOU FUCKERS THAT YOU WERE WRONG!</p>
<p>Ok finally my post is over so… Thanks for reading.</p>

ur dumb<br>
the poles are supposed to switch every few 99999 years, and apparently its supposed to switch some time near 2012<br>
also the poles of the sun switch<br>
also on that date the sun is in the middle of our galaxy, not sure what the significance is though[/quote]Someone has been feeding you a load of hypocritical bullshit.</p>
