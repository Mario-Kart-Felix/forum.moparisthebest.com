    <description>I liked this movie, but it wasn&#39;t like it was portray in the commercials.

SPOILERZ DON&#39;T GET ANGREE IF U SEE WUT IS DER 
[size=6pt]Tim had a wife, and one night while turning off his phone he crashed into a car, and into a bus. The bus was filled with 7 people, and they all died along with his wife. He goes around seeking nice people who truely need transplants, or a new life and helping them with that. He meets a girl that he falls in love with. He finds out near the end that the chance of her getting a transplant would be 5%, so Tim makes a call, that you hear him make at the begining saying &quot;there has been a suicide the victom was me&quot; and his body is taken to a hospital where the sevend people he found get what they need. One woman however, wasn&#39;t given an organ, but a now home away from an abusive boyfriend. The story ends right after Tim kills himself by allowing a jellyfish to kill him  [/size]
10/10 Very good movie.</description>
