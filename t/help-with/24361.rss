    <description>I cant join any server, everytime i try it says, &quot;this server is down, please try again (blah blah blah)&quot;, but my brother can get on the same server with his computer. I was able to log on to any server yesterday but i cant now. 

I know this is probably wrong place to post this, but the &quot;Questions&quot; forum is down.</description>
