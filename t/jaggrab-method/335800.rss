    <title>JAGGRAB Method</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jaggrab-method/335800</link>
    <description>Quick question about a feature I&#39;m adding. Does the JAGGRAB function, when it reads the values from the server and packs it into the cache, if, say, you had the 377 cache with items to 7995, and you sent the data from item 11700 to the cache, and then later the client pulls item 10958, would the order go 7994, 7995, 11700, 10958, or would the client order itself in ascending order? Or if not that, would it add the 2000+ placeholders before adding the items? Or is it possible it would place it at the correct index and sort from there?</description>
