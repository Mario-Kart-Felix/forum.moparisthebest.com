    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-hoster/227983</link>
    <description>Yes well i need a hoster for my server, it is just going to start, but i have big plans for it, i have the forums and everything, just the slight detail i cannot host a server, so i would really appreciate if someone willing to host would post here or contact me on my msn that is

For hosting, all donations for the server will go to you, and also you will get owner with me in the server, i am planning on a great server with good economy and great community, anyone interested please contact me, i would really appreciate it and if your not interested please do not flame or tell me anything, i dont need your comments, i only need a hoster. Thank you
