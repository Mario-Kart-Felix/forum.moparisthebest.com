    <title>Looking for an Herber</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-an-herber/146051</link>
    <description>Hello all, thanks for tuning in here.

I am looking for 1 of 2 specific herb location spots and the script must be able to pick a lock, bank and do the standards. it is only to pick up Law Runes, Mind Runes, Air runes, and Fire runes along with the misc. half keys and rubies +. 

i&#39;d like it to bury bones as well if not too complicated and ONLY pickup herbs from grimy ranarr and up. all others can stay on the ground and whatnot.

depending on the spot, pst me if your willing to take on the job and i&#39;ll tell you the locs for the one and the other if the first doesn&#39;t seem feasible.



Willing to pay RL cash via paypal verified member n whatnot. Hit me up on here or on aim @ Shtcricket





Thanks for your time everyone! GL!</description>
