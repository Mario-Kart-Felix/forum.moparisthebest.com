    <description>Paying .25-.50 for working answer. 
---
Hey guys, This is going to sound like a noob question, Which i&#39;m sorry about. I&#39;m pretty new too HTML, So I don&#39;t know very much about it. So here&#39;s the problem:

I have a website for my RSPS, And a place that you can register on the forums. I added in a text box when you register, saying &quot;In Game Name&quot;. That works and everything, but I want to be able to show it on the users profile. Because currently, if you enter your IGN in their, it does nothing. I would like to be able to see it in the users profile. 
---
Here is the coding for the text box I added:
[code]&lt;/tr&gt;
             &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;
            In Game Name:
            &lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;
            &lt;input id=&quot;username&quot; name=&quot;username&quot; autocomplete=&quot;off&quot; maxlength=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
            &lt;/td&gt;[/code]
So how would I make it add their IGN that they typed into that box come up onto their profile?</description>
