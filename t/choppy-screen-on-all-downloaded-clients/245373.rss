    <title>Choppy screen on ALL downloaded clients</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/choppy-screen-on-all-downloaded-clients/245373</link>
    <description>Hello, i&#39;ve been searching the forums for a while and can&#39;t find answers too my problems, so im now posting this. I have downloaded moparscape client, and it worked normally for a while, but one day the screen became very choppy. I do not have a screen shot on it or anything but there is another post on it with a screenshot, but that post does not have any answers. I think the name is something like &quot;help choppy screen &lt;friends&gt;&quot; or something like that. Too add to the problem, i downloaded a private servers client, donkiescape.no-ip.org and the screen is the same way. Does anyone have any answers? I would like any suggestions. And my other problem is silab servers. When i load it, it says this:     Not Found
The requested URL /loaderror_savefile.html was not found on this server.

Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.

 I have tried to download the client, but the same error appears when i start it up. any suggestions? Please, and thank you.</description>
