    <description>Well, I&#39;m trying to start up my own client and I&#39;ve been using Tico&#39;s guide for most of the way. Right now I&#39;m trying to add global objects but I can&#39;t find the code to start it. On Tico&#39;s guide he gives you the code to initialize it and says to put it after a certain line of code, but that line of code is not in my client.java. I tried downloaded two different source codes, but neither of them had it. Help anyone?</description>
