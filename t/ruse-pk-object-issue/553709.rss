    <title>Ruse pk Object issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ruse-pk-object-issue/553709</link>
    <description>So i moved a few of the thieving stalls/bank booths to entrana (via the customobjects.java in the client), and now they wont work. Seems like any object i move there doesn&#39;t do anything when i click on it. I checked and each object has its own case meaning they should work right? The stalls worked prior to moving</description>
