    <title>Auto kicking?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/auto-kicking/265843</link>
    <description>Okay every time im on the server i notice that there are new players. But the problem is that they are usually at home just joining the server. But the problem is that every time one of them connects, they get kicked... So i think it has to do with them not having a specific client? If that is the problem can someone show me how to set it so that they can use ANY client??

And if that isnt the problem can someone please help me solve this issue? i would appreciate it a lot.

Thanks in advance!</description>
