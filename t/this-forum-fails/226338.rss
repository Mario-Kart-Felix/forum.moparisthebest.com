<p>in my opinion, moparscape moderator is much worse in some cases than graphics master if we are making generalisations here, just because graphics masters earnt their award. most of the more recent moderators, including myself just annoyed administrators so much that they just gave it to us to shut us up. that is with the exception of casey. and thuglife. (sorry if i missed anyone else out).</p>
<p>about me saying that frank_ can convince people on irc and that, it may have been just one incident but i came onto the irc for the first time, frank_ called me an idiot and from then on almost every active user thought the same of me. after a while i managed to convince some that i may be stupid but they could still talk to me without acting like a spaz and swearing at me whenever i said something. i will admit that other people decided for themselves that they didnt like me but quite a few just followed him.[/quote]</p>
<p>Since when did i say that moparscape mod was a special position?<br>
What the fuck are you on about.</p>
