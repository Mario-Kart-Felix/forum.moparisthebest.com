    <description>hi ive looked at many tutorials about jdk environment settings and reinstalled jdk anbout 3-5 times and have finnally decided that i should ask someone experienced (or know how to do this) to help me using the software remote assistance which is most likely to be ready installed on your computer and can easily be done using msn if u can help me please post and PM me and i shall give you my MSN to do this.

thank you</description>
