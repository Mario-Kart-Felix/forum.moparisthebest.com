    <title>RSPS development getting held back due to lack of data gathering</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsps-development-getting-held-back-due-to-lack-of-data-gathering/278418</link>
    <description>I think evolution of good open source server&#39;s are getting held back by lack of important external data such as NPC/Item Ground Locations &amp; Definitions.

Each time i get into the feeling of creating an advanced server, i&#39;m always held back by that data, theres very little of it and i&#39;m not spending my time gathering data that anyone can grab. (not to mention I have done this already for RSC servers)

I don&#39;t know if its just me, but i don&#39;t even bother creating a server without this data collected, anybody can record this data from moparscape yet nobody does it. What&#39;s so hard? I think everyone who can&#39;t help out in the programming side of things should at least help to record data, logging in RS2 and recording NPC ids, spawn rates, x and y coordinates.

Nobody wants to build a private server and have 5 random NPC&#39;s sitting in varrock, it&#39;s not even worth the time.

This data is essential, and very boring to gather but it needs to be done one way or another.</description>

The main reason this probably isn’t being done is because not many people have access to every NPC in RuneScape. Plus with several thousands, it could take weeks to get every single one. I don’t think this is generally MoparScape’s fault,… Err wait, yes it is. Nevermind.<br>

<p>I understand nobody can get 317 data anymore, but IIRC all the mob spawns that you can attack in the free-to-play version of RuneScape i don’t think have changed at all, no newer mobs have been added to it that they don’t have in the 317 i think.</p>
