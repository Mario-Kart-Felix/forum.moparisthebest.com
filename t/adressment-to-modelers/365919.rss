    <description>Hello, I have been helping this forum for a long time now, if I was a troller, I wouldn&#39;t have come back right? I never meant for (my honesty) to fuck you guys up so much..

This is acceptable under &#39;this&#39; section as it is to do with issues in this board.

No tubefish, I don&#39;t hate you, disrespect is a sign of a liar, if I&#39;m being honest, how the fuck is that trolling? Yes.. I soo need that p90x stuff, do you know me? I don&#39;t know you so I don&#39;t fucking judge your ass off, I may be fat, I may not, but how do you know if I am or not?

I am sorry for being honest, and now, here&#39;s a lie (I will be staying on theese forums)..

I have had enough! Of this.. I can&#39;t say anything.. So if thats the case I will not be modeling any further, and I don&#39;t want to waste time staying trying to help you people if you are going to hate me so much..

I have said I will be quitting many times, I thought that you people could change but obviously I am wrong.. This time I will not be returning..

Farewell, thank tubefish and whip of soulz, and all other (trollers) on here..

Then again, I don&#39;t post shit in the section called &#39;H1 SK1LL3R&#39; right? Thats another sign of trolling

Goodbye.. Thanks for your trolling, it really helped me, thanks for the people that liked my work..</description>

Get the fuck over yourself, stop cursing wherever you can in your sentences, stop thinking you are the best and can tell someone their model sucks, and lastly, just get the fuck out for the final time, you’re obviously not wanted here.</p>

Moparscape isn’t going to change any time soon mostly because of people like you to be completely honest. I am not stuck up like you, I will admit that I have trolled and flamed even spammed before, but for you to sit here and say you haven’t then…well…stop being so stuck up.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m stuck up? It won’t change, your right, because you will continually flame people and then they will fight back like me, I’m not stuck up, I just hate people who are as rude as you, I don’t intend to troll and if being honest on this forum is considered trolling, it just proves that it’s worse again…</p>
<p>You will never learn krackkid, but I will, and I’m really sure that EA games will let you work there with that shitty attitude…</p>
<p>Keep flaming me krackkid, I really have no sympathy for you what-so-ever… As I have already said, I will be leaving anyway so don’t make it worse, you could at least try to change and let me post honest opinions because obviously that’s what you do to me… So whatever, you can’t take what you dish out, then guess what else is going out…[/quote]</p>
<p>Or you could just ignore him when he flames you and not make things worse.</p>

The hole reason I got a bad attitude is because of you and your shitty ass way of picking if your going to stay or not, when the going get tuff you leave simple as that.<br>
[hr]<br>
and I been around this forums for a while I have learned a lot, and I know a lot about how things work around here. Also I haven’t flamed a person in the past week. which yes is good for me, normally I get a warning everyday.</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>To sum it all up, you don’t need a thread, just leave<br>
End of discussion.</p>

              <p>Hello, I have been helping this forum for a long time now, if I was a troller, I wouldn’t have come back right? I never meant for (my honesty) to fuck you guys up so much…</p>
<p>This is acceptable under ‘this’ section as it is to do with issues in this board.</p>
<p>No tubefish, I don’t hate you, disrespect is a sign of a liar, if I’m being honest, how the fuck is that trolling? Yes… I soo need that p90x stuff, do you know me? I don’t know you so I don’t fucking judge your ass off, I may be fat, I may not, but how do you know if I am or not?</p>
<p>I am sorry for being honest, and now, here’s a lie (I will be staying on theese forums)…</p>
<p>I have had enough! Of this… I can’t say anything… So if thats the case I will not be modeling any further, and I don’t want to waste time staying trying to help you people if you are going to hate me so much…</p>
<p>I have said I will be quitting many times, I thought that you people could change but obviously I am wrong… This time I will not be returning…</p>
<p>Farewell, thank tubefish and whip of soulz, and all other (trollers) on here…</p>
<p>Then again, I don’t post shit in the section called ‘H1 SK1LL3R’ right? Thats another sign of trolling</p>
<p>Goodbye… Thanks for your trolling, it really helped me, thanks for the people that liked my work…</p>
