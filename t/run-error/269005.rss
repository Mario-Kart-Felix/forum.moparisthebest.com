    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/run-error/269005</link>
    <description>Well ive seen a lot of others with this problem but no real response. Ive had my source for  awhile now and I do know basic java- so you dont have to go ALL noob on me :D. Just today when I try to log on my main admin account- and a new account same error occurs. 

[code]
Jb Blaze signing into server

chacracterfile not found:
Moreinfo file not found:

[/code]

in an attempt to log in again i now get this along with it

[code] Jb Blaze is already logged in[/code]

Im not even sure were to BEGIN looking for this type of error. Im sure this is gonna be a pain in the neck. But if any has any past experience on this id appreciate a response.

Thanks.</description>
