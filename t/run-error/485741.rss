    <title>Run error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/run-error/485741</link>
    <description>So my run stopped working, I was messing with the item.cfg files making them look nice, checking all stats (This source absolutely blows, poorly coded and sloppy, but it is helping me learn a lot for a beginner), and locating some null items that were placed into the server.

After messing around for a few days (kept my computer on frequently saving) I compiled what I had done and my run.exe now produces this error...

Now I figured that I put some accidental spaces instead of tabbing, so I checked and sure enough there was some spaces. Fixed until when I ctrl+f, put in (space) into the search box, there comes up 2 spaces for every 1 line (of course because the spaces for the &quot;item = x&quot;.

I have located most of the locations of the itemHandlers, but I have no idea where the error is coming up and why. If someone could guide me in the right direction, that would be great, thank you!</description>

              <p>I’ve come across this before, it could be or not be the same problem, but you could have accidentally added in an extra value in one of the items, like and extra stat if you understand what i mean. I’m not sure how you could find that out quickly, the only solution i can think of would require you to find the original item.cfg before you altered it. If you could get that back then you could cut your edited version and paste it someone else like your desktop, then paste the old one in your server. Then you could take chunks of the old version and replace bits of your new one, that way you could narrow down what area the error is in quickly.</p>
<p>I know it sounds complicated and there’s a chance that’s not even your problem, but it wouldn’t hurt to try  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
