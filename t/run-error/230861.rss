    <title>Run error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/run-error/230861</link>
    <description>Hi i just finished trying to port forward. My friend was hosting it, but he cant have it up the much. so he sent me the source, and the username and pass to the no-ip so i can port forward on my comp. thing is he didnt have a router. so i eventually i figured it out. and i set up the port to 43594 and such. then opened the no-ip (blazingrangerz.no-ip.org) then port forwarded on my router page. set up the static ip and all. evrything is still as it is. but i when i got to silabs, or the client i made it says this...

[url=http://img151.imageshack.us/my.php?image=runerrorwa7.png]http://img151.imageshack.us/my.php?image=runerrorwa7.png[/url]

i didnt sign in as &quot;loler&quot; though, i normally signed in with my name. rember, i have never done this on my comp.
also when i run it, the status checker on my website says its online. though it doesnt work for me. so i wonder, does it work for other players, and its just me? i dunno.

any ideas?


-------------------EDIT--------
ok i just closed it and re-opened the run server, and now its just error connecting. not even that weird &quot;loler&quot; stuff. no-ip is still on.... so ya

any ideas?</description>

<p>I am still not sure on what a EGUI is, and i cant figure it out. that error no longer occurs, and i need help ASAP. there are people waiting! again i have rechecked and dopne evrything.</p>
<p>from the static ip, to the portforward page, to the no-ip. ive done it all!</p>
<p>im starting to think its something wrong with the source, but one again, my friend was able to run it fine at his place, but he doesnt have a router, he just had to set up the satic ip. i have a comcast cg814wg router.</p>
<p>any ideas?</p>

              <p>hmm that error message that you posted i dont think its an actually error. if you wondering why you typed in ur log in info and its saying connecting to server but you cant see the gameframe then i think its because if you edit anything in ur server file remember to compile it. also check ur EGUI and make sure that the server ip has the name of ur server.</p>
