I just got home from school evacuation. Its like 9/11 out there. We were evacuated due to smoke and the approaching fire.

Gives me some time to get to 91 fletching  :D

They were going to send everyone who didnt get a ride home by 10:30 to another school  :eek:. I started hallin&#39; ass.

We&#39;ve already seen a few helicopters go over with river water to help put it out, and now theirs a threat from falling ambers that are starting more fires.

Might not have school tomorrow either [/s] No skewl  :D</description>
