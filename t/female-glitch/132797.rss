    <title>Female glitch</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/female-glitch/132797</link>
    <description>When a female puts on a piece of armor, or anything in fact, it comes on as a male part and makes it look weird. Is there any way to fix this so it goes on a female as a female item? Thanks for your help.

Ive tried adding ::male and ::female commands, It does no use, its exactly the same as my character select screen, Just that if the person is female, Well the armour looks like male armour not female armour. So do not say you need to add these commands or I need to put in a character select screen.</description>
