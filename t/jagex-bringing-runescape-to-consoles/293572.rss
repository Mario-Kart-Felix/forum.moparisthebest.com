    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jagex-bringing-runescape-to-consoles/293572</link>
    <description>I was just reading through JaGeX&#39;s Questions and Answers page for runescape, and it stated that.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Pur35 Ownage asks; 
Would there ever be a console version on RuneScape like for xbox360 + PS3, i think that they would be a great success if you could get the controls right, but they would have to speak not type which is much better. 

Yes, indeed, we are looking at all the consoles at the moment and deciding which one or two are best for our community.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I myself was pretty surprised by this, what do you guys think?
:)

Could be fun, lol.</description>

also MAG on the PS3 is going to have 256 players which is also an FPS. So if they can deal with heavy load of 256 players on a more complex game something like runescape would be fine</p>

              <p>Probably buy a disc with the “game” on it, but it would actually be the client, update the walking system, Make the way players face different positions more smooth. Probably some skills system like final fantasy/balders gate. Use the joystick to cycle through tabs, X/A for select(equivalent to a mouse click on an interface), Circle/B to close all open interfaces, then walking handled like a normal RPG. Similar to final fantasy.</p>

They’d want it all to be one unified thing.  So, either theyd implement a walking engine into their game for use on consoles (use a flag to control which engine to use), or they would find some way to make what they have work.  I’m going with the latter.</p>

<p>You just embedded an image of using a dds spec on the Wii in my head. I am excite.</p>
<p>Other than that this game will prolly sux and will have their own seperate servers. If any game, probably Mechscape will become a console game since it is more suited for one.</p>

A Runescape movie wouldn’t be that bad. I mean, it would be quite a bit like LOTR combined with Beowulf and other similar movies.<br>

<p>Skilling isn’t really part of the storyline of RS. I can’t really think of a good concept, but something like an adventure through the RS lands, a visit to the duel arena, maybe castle wars and ending up killing something big as the kalaphite queen or the barrows brothers.</p>
