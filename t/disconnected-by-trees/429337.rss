    <title>Disconnected by trees</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/disconnected-by-trees/429337</link>
    <description>When I click on certain trees on my 562/657 server it disconnects me and crashes my client. The trees I know of that do that are the ones on tutorial island and the ones near Isafdar. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</description>
