    <title>A better sorting algorithm for the server status page</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-better-sorting-algorithm-for-the-server-status-page/367067</link>
    <description>I decided to think of a fair yet effective algorithm as to how the list should be sorted (not strictly vote based, not strictly percentage based).

Uptime is highly valued, but people who vote for a server should be valued more - they are human beings with valid opinions and reasoning behind their opinions. However, server reliability should also be valued.

The algorithm I came up with is:
[code]
n = p * 0.2d + 2v
[/code]
n = overall score (higher score means higher on the list compared to other scores)
p = average uptime percentage
d = age (in days)
v = total vote score (positive or negative depending on total upvotes or downvotes)

This algorithm assures that voters have a lot of weight, but server uptime percentage also is very important (servers with 100% uptime will have 100 points right off the bat). Each uptime percentage is worth 1 point, and each vote (positive or negative!) is worth 2 points (negative is -2 points).

Both uptime percentage (server reliability) and player votes (the peoples opinion) are taken into account. I think that this is a pretty good algorithm. What do you guys think?</description>

</aside>
<p>Well, unless you combined the concepts, I see problems on both ends. If it’s a grade, you never have a top sever. You have a ton of servers at the bottom and a ton at the top. Maybe that’s the best way to go, I don’t know.</p>
<p>Otherwise, a progressional system with relative variables could be used. That way no outrageous variables can be created (ie, 10k votes) but, at the same time, you don’t have the limitations of a graded system.</p>
<p>Overall, I doubt any of these systems would be implemented. They seem rather complex, even if the implementation is all backend-related.</p>
<p>Edit: Another way to look at my suggestion is as a method where a subjective measurement and an objective measurement are combined to form a comparative quantity, I suppose.</p>

<p>Hmm, I think I might have actually countered you wrong. I originally intended for the popularity and reliability ratings to be relative, so that no server can dominate another. But, at the same time, there would be no “top server.” I guess it would probably be better to have both of the variables be incrementable/progressional, as you put it.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think your example is slightly misguided. A server running regularly for four months should have a very high reliability rating, even if it has a poor popularity rating. Using averages, this balances out to a decent score. This allows any reliable server to always bounce back through popularity.</p>
<p>A younger server would have a great difficulty in competing with an older server, because it has (or ideally should have) an poorer reliability rating. Even if a server steadily becomes more unreliable, a good popularity rating would allow it to bounce back.</p>
<p>Unless I’m mistaken, my suggestion always allows a server to bounce back, and all servers start off at the bottom, rather than the top.</p>

              <p>I think a factor such as “reliability” should be derived from uptime and lifetime. Another factor, “popularity,” would be derived from uptime and votes. A cumulative score would be derived from the reliability and popularity, creating a balanced system.</p>
<p>More explained: uptime is already calculated from lifetime, but it still represents a unique, significant quantity. The higher the uptime in the shorter lifetime, the more meaningless the uptime (thus, a lower reliability). A lower uptime over a greater lifetime is also a lower reliability. Only if uptime can stay consistently high over an extended lifetime will the reliability be high. Relative maximums or some sort of ratio system would need to be used for fairness.</p>
<p>Popularity is a bit more evident, I think. The more votes over the less lifetime is a higher probability (an inverse usage of uptime as from reliability). The less votes over a greater lifetime is obviously a less popular server. Some line of equilibrium would have to be established I think, in order to fairly judge popularity (could be done with averages, I suppose).</p>
<p>These factors could be combined as simply as an average, or they can be scaled. I guess it depends on whether players are more interested in reliability or in popularity (I think they are pretty close to being even, but I have no clue). Another quantitative measurement to consider is a more accurate form of popularity, such as recording the number of times a server profile is viewed, or how many times the play button is clicked.</p>
<p>My two cents, I guess… <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

Having a reliable source, or dedicated is way more important than how many people “like” a server. How do we even know the votes are accurate? Half of the votes could be from one single person. 200 to 10,000 is a horrible ratio. Where that algorithm stands, dedication is valued 99% less than “popularity”. It’s 1% dedication and 99% popularity. Blakeman mentioned “fairness” before he even presented the algorithm, and if you ask me it’s a bit misleading. Of course I’m not blaming blakeman, I’m just saying he should revise. There’s a lot to take into account.</p>

              <p>You would have to set ratios for each variable depending on how valuable and how common each are. For example, if there are more guest votes than days online you would have to logically make each guest vote worth less than the value of each day online.</p>
<p>Lets say the uptime is at 100%, members votes are at 500, it’s been alive for 15 days and guest votes are at 1,000.</p>
<p>Simply, we could add all of the values together:</p>
<p>100 + 500 + 15 + 1,000 = 1,615</p>
<p>Convert 1,615 into a percentile whole of 100(%)</p>
<p>and then figure out how much each variable has affected the total.</p>
<p>v/1,615 = n%/100% (v being variable value and n being significance on the total of 100%)</p>
<p>uptime: 100/1,615 =    6.19%<br>
memv: 500/1615 =     30.95%<br>
life: 15/1,616 =             .93%<br>
guesv: 1,000/1,615 = 61.91%<br>
-------<br>
~100%</p>
<p>The reason why I’m showing you this is because although you can set uptime to be worth the most points, it can still be outweighed by the guest votes. In otherwords, your most valuable variable will be outnumbered by your least valued variable unless you distribute them evenly.</p>
<p>Anyways, somehow you have to even out the playing field for every variable.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Frankly, I’m a bit confused and hoping that I’m not reading blake’s algorithm correctly.</p>
<p>[quote=“blakeman8192, post:1, topic:367067”]The algorithm I came up with is:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">n = p * 0.2d + 2v</code></pre>
<p>n = overall score (higher score means higher on the list compared to other scores)<br>
p = average uptime percentage<br>
d = age (in days)<br>
v = total vote score (positive or negative depending on total upvotes or downvotes)[/quote]What variables are you using for v? You understand the possibility of the total votes being about 10,000 and multiplying that by 2 would give that portion of the algorithm (votes portion) 20,000 points… and then if p is at 100 and days are at 10 it would be 100(.2*10) which would equal 200 for that portion of the algorithm (uptime and life portion)… So you’re saying that the uptime and days it’s been up is only worth ~1% of their total points?.. What?</p>

Actually, a server with 100% uptime will have 20 points on the first day, then 40 on the next day, unless they get votes. They would only get 100 points on the fifth day.<br>
How about:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">n = 0.3(p(d-1)) + 5v</code></pre>
<p>EXAMPLE -<br>
Day 1, 100% uptime, no votes = 0 points<br>
Day 2, 100% uptime, no votes = 30 points<br>
Day 3, 98% uptime, 2 votes = 89 points<br>
Day 15, 97% uptime, 40 votes = 607 points<br>
Day 30, 96% uptime, 93 votes = 1300 points  whereas one with no votes would have 835</p>
<p>[/quote]<br>
Good idea, but I don’t see why mine is bad if all of them start at 20 (relativity ftw). <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
EDIT: Also, that is a <span class="bbcode-b">lot</span> of weight on votes, and you have to keep in mind that lots of servers bribe their players into voting so the votes aren’t always legit.[/quote]If you weigh votes at all, it’s not going to be ‘legit’. But, chances are that if a server has a lot of votes, players think it is good enough to play. I don’t think people vote for bad servers, even if they are bribed like that.</p>

              <p>I like the idea a lot mate, and I do agree this should be what the status page should be based off of. I don’t see flaws that would lead to danger to the status page, and how much people would dislike the fact about the update to it.</p>
<p>Good job Blakeman.</p>

              <p>I decided to think of a fair yet effective algorithm as to how the list should be sorted (not strictly vote based, not strictly percentage based).</p>
<p>Uptime is highly valued, but people who vote for a server should be valued more - they are human beings with valid opinions and reasoning behind their opinions. However, server reliability should also be valued.</p>
<p>The algorithm I came up with is:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">n = p * 0.2d + 2v</code></pre>
<p>n = overall score (higher score means higher on the list compared to other scores)<br>
p = average uptime percentage<br>
d = age (in days)<br>
v = total vote score (positive or negative depending on total upvotes or downvotes)</p>
<p>This algorithm assures that voters have a lot of weight, but server uptime percentage also is very important (servers with 100% uptime will have 100 points right off the bat). Each uptime percentage is worth 1 point, and each vote (positive or negative!) is worth 2 points (negative is -2 points).</p>
<p>Both uptime percentage (server reliability) and player votes (the peoples opinion) are taken into account. I think that this is a pretty good algorithm. What do you guys think?</p>
