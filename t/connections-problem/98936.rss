    <title>Connection&#39;s Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connections-problem/98936</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know if this should be under this section or under the tutorials section but can someone help me with other players connecting to my server. When I type &quot;localhost&quot; I can get in but other people can&#39;t seem to get in. Do I need to port-forward? Can someone explain what to do? 

  Thank-you!  :)</description>

<p>I’d advise you not to port forward, because you could loose valuble passwords that you dont want other people to know (ex: banking pins, email passwords, etc.) But it’s your choice. If you dont do any of that stuff on your computer, go ahead and port forward.</p>
<p>But if you choose not too, as bad as it is, you could use hamachi. I agree, it might suck, but thats why I went with it, to keep my personal information safe from other people knowing <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Heres the link to download Hamachi if you change you mind:  <a href="http://www.hamachi.cc/download/list.php" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.hamachi.cc/download/list.php</a></p>
