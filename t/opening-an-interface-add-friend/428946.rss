    <title>Opening an Interface (Add friend)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/opening-an-interface-add-friend/428946</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

I&#39;m currently trying to open the add friend interface in which the player types the name of their desired friend. However, every interface ID I find for it disconnects the player. I understand that this interface is probably not as simple as just using a command to open the interface. However I&#39;m looking for any advice on how I can open this interface.

All help is appreciated.

Thank you.</description>
