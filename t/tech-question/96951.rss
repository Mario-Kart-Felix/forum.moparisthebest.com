    <title>Tech Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tech-question/96951</link>
    <description>Hello, my HP laptop&#39;s power cord isn&#39;t working. I have a compaq nc6230, my other power cord (nc6000) is ripped and doesn&#39;t work. Anyways, mine wasn&#39;t working, so i switched the plug part that goes into the wall (that connects to the battery pack.
But, when I moved my laptop, the power cord moved and stopped working. I have tried the same thing to fix it, but I cannot. Also, it makes a beeping noise which apparently my parents cannot hear (only when its plugged in, of course.)
Please Help!
Thanks :)

<p>We never really found out what the problem was exactly but we did have to replace the part the cord goes into on the computer…(sorry I don’t know the name of the part)</p>
<p>Some guy said I probably was cause by a power serge. plugging in and unplugging your laptop without a serge protector can really cause some wear and tare on your comp.</p>
<p>I’m not saying this is what happen to you, but its a possibility</p>
