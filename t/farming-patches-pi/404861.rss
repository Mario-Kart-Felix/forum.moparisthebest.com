    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/farming-patches-pi/404861</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve noticed that when I added a tree patch where you put in the herb and the herb pops up grown, it grows over in catherby, which is where the other farming patch is. (I copied the other farming patch&#39;s ID.)


I found this. What should I do with it? I&#39;ve tried adding that same thing with the co-ordinates of the farming patch I want it to be at, but it didn&#39;t work. And also, I want that farming patch in Catherby to work too, along with the one I want to add.


[code]
		loadCustomSpawns(c);
		if (c.distanceToPoint(2813, 3463) &lt;= 60) {
			c.getFarming().updateHerbPatch();
		}
