    <description>I am looking for a strategic team of dedicated members who are willing to put reasonable hours of contribution into a systematic project. The idea is to create a unique concept which will be emulated into a rs2 server. The project will be hosted on a network and be playable. I am looking for at least 1-3 new members who are experienced enough to undertake this task. The server base has not yet been decided, main runescape features will also be implemented allowing a all-rounded gameplay.

Each current RuneScape skill will be taken, and written to perfection, as well as combat, minigames and other various runescape features. This task isnt going to be easy nor will be done in a few days. This is a Long term project, and i aim this to go pretty far.
