    <title>RuneScape classic private server - Beta 1 weeks</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-classic-private-server-beta-1-weeks/446829</link>
    <description>Hello, it&#39;s been requested to open up a old popular server, but I don&#39;t know much about it. Therefore we have  a &quot;1 week beta stage&quot; to gather information and perhaps bugs.

All accounts can be deleted or reset to this date if anything would be found such as item duping stats farming on any other way that its allowed.

Does who are with us in this week, testing, playing like regular players will be rewarded.

Keep in mind that I&#39;m not funding this with other peoples money, we do not expect to raise money to make a living. if we decide to open donation/subscription we will discuss how the money should be handled.
