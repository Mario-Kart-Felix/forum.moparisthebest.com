    <title>How to fix a pking dupe</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-fix-a-pking-dupe/334743</link>
    <description>i need help with a pking dupe. i believe it has something to do with the deahtimer or the emote. This is how u do the dupe.
Person A has the items your going to dupe.
Person B has 1item+(like a d scimi or whatever.)

They both tele to magebanks(can take place anywhere in wildy)

Person B attacks Person A until their hp is around 30 or 20.
Then they both teleport to assault.
Person A attacks a guard and allows the guard to kill them.
As soon as Person A dies Person B logs out fast
causing Person A to dc which will kick him/her
and they will still have their items. Then the items
Person A had will appear on the ground. etc.

I would appreciate some help. I rarely do ask unless I have no
other options. Thanks and bye.</description>
