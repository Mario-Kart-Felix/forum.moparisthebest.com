    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparscape-help/266145</link>
    <description>ok so i have downloaded Moparscape client.

I just wanted to know if someone or anyone could teach me the basics well in a private server.

not like be in the server but like how to make scripts and stuff. i know how to open up the item, npc, and object lists. 

i know how to get the items. I know how to get multiple items in one thing.

but i made one character. Now i made a new character but all the lvls were 99. how would i fix that.

also some of the servers i was on before start you off at lvl 3. im fine with that, but when u hit something with

attack strength or deffence u got like 300 or 500 xp per hit. how do i do that?

Also it sometimes freezes on me. how do i stop that from happening.

how do i add a teleport? one server i was on had a ::help command. it brought up a thing with helpful stuff.

it said say ::lessers to go to the lesser demons.

or ::dragons to go to dragons. at the top of this it said like easy ways to make money and a whole load of stuff.

how do i do things like this? i know its a lot of questions but if you know an answer to any of them please tell me.

it would really help. 

Thanks :)  ~Now3r3~</description>
