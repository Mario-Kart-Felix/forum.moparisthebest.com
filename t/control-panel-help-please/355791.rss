    <title>Control panel help... Please?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/control-panel-help-please/355791</link>
    <description>[font=courier]I really like the idea of having the control panel that opens when you run your server, but I&#39;d like it to be available for my staff members as well... Is it possible to program the control panel to start up when you run the client, depending on your player rights? 

I&#39;ve thought a lot about this, I can&#39;t imagine why it wouldn&#39;t work, if it&#39;s coded correctly.

Could it not also be coded to run like a client.? You&#39;d run the control panel in a separate file from the server or client you are playing on, and it would &#39;listen in&#39; on specified ip and/or port, just like a client does.?


I&#39;m probably getting a little ahead of myself and my abilities here, but I&#39;m positive other people as well as myself, want this and would really like it. 

Can anyone give me some help? [/font]</description>
