<p>PHP is a recursive acronym for; ‘Hypertext Preprocessor’. It is an immensely popular open-source scripting language. It’s designed to be especially beneficial to web development and it is able to be embedded into HTML. It can be extremely useful in the case of where making a specific webpage you’d like, HTML does not have the capabilities to perform certain actions or processes. You can also use it to simplify your time, as opposed to writing hundreds of lines of HTML.</p>
<p>What makes PHP standout is that it’s a server-based language. As opposed to JavaScript; which is client-sided. What this means is that the code you write is executed on the server, generating the HTML code which is then sent to the client for processing. The client, once received the results of your script, would not know what the underlying code was. You could even program your server to process all of your files with HTML, so your users couldn’t exactly tell what you’re really up to.</p>
<p>One of the best things with PHP is that you can jump right in! It’s easy to understand, so don’t be afraid of it. You’ll come in, start learning, and within just a few hours, start writing some simple scripts.</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section11]1.1 - What will we be learning?[/anchor][/size][/center]</p>
<p>In this guide, you will be learning all the basic necessities in PHP. From variables, to functions, to classes, and all sorts of great utilities that will help you in the everyday usage of PHP! This guide is designed for the audience of newcomers in the language. If you’re intermediate, above average, or just profound with this language, then I don’t think you will find much of this information useful - as you have probably already learned it. PHP is a bold and dynamic language, so I envy you for giving it a shot! Hopefully, you’ll end up being a widely successful web developer.</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section12]1.2 - What’s an IDE?[/anchor][/size][/center]</p>
<p>IDE is an acronym for; ‘integrated development environment’. An IDE will help you a long ways in the development field! It will show where you have made a mistake, or what is being used and what’s not. It will also compile your code and check it before you can! It’s an amazing tool to use if you’re a developer, and can make your projects that you construct much more at ease. They have unique tools such as syntax highlighters, code parsers, built-in compilation devices, and etc. If you’re working on a large project and <span class="bbcode-i">aren’t</span> using an IDE, then I don’t know what you’re doing!</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section13]1.3 - Selecting an IDE[/anchor]<br>
[/size][/center]<br>
Selecting an IDE is as simple as pie! There are a few popular IDE’s out there, and they are popular for a reason. They have a wide variety of tools, UI’s, and plugins that make your coding experience just that much better. There are two ‘most-popular’ IDE’s available for free: <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Eclipse</a>, and <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">NetBeans</a>.</p>
<p>[ul][<em>]<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-php-developers/lunasr2" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">You can find the Eclipse PHP IDE here!</a><br>
[</em>]<a href="https://netbeans.org/features/php/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">You can find the NetBeans PHP IDE here!</a>[/ul]</p>
<p>Go and check each one out, decide for your own, and download that one. They may be a little weird to use at first, as it’s a strange environment to get used to, but once you get the hang of it - it’s a cakewalk!</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section14]1.4 - When and when-not to use an IDE[/anchor][/size][/center]</p>
<p>IDE’s are great and all, but there are times when you shouldn’t use them. For example, IDE’s typically have the capabilities of doing simple work for you. It may sound nice, yes; however, you should be concerned on what you’ve actually learned. When learning the basics, I recommend to use a simple syntax highlighter, or <span class="bbcode-b">code editor</span>. Code editors, such as <a href="http://www.vim.org/download.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Vim</a> and <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.7.9.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Notepad++</a>, are great ways to still understand what exactly you’re writing, and learn in the process. As they have syntax highlighters and code parsers typically build within them, you needn’t worry about your code looking too ugly to work on.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, I recommend you use one of the code editors as previously stated in this section. Code editors are especially beneficial to the learning process.</p>

        <p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">[size=6][anchor=section2]2 - Variables[/anchor][/size]</span>[/center]</p>
<p>Now that we’re getting into variables, we can finally start getting into programming! Variables are little bits of code to store data. These types of data can be a range of things! Such as integers, strings, arrays, functions, or even instances of a class! Alas, for now, we must stick with the basics. In this section, we’ll be introducing you to integers, strings, basic mathematics, and how to call these things.</p>
<p>To get things started, I would like to point out that variables are represented by a dollar sign, followed by the title of said variable. For an example of this, you would use:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>//Your first variable!<br>
$exampleVariable;</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
This would indicate that you have set a variable, and might call on it later.</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section21]2.1 - Integers[/anchor][/size][/center]</p>
<p>Now that we have a variable set, we can apply a value to this. For starters, let’s go ahead and use an integer! An integer is, to put it simply, just a number. It tells the server that there is a variable there, that is a number, and the amount of this number. So, if you wanted this variable to just be the number 10, you would use:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>//This variable is now an integer!<br>
$exampleVariable = 10;</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
That would tell the server that variable ‘exampleVariable’ is the number 10.</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section22]2.2 - Strings[/anchor]<br>
[/size][/center]<br>
However, not all variables are going to be numbers! You can also turn this into a string as well. Eh… You can turn a variable into lots of things, but these are just the basics of variables for now! Strings are just bits of text. You can make it one word, or even an essay if you so choose! So, if you’d prefer to have exampleVariable as a text instead, you can do that with this example:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>//This variable is now a string!<br>
$exampleVariable = “I’m a string!”;</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
Now remember, strings <span class="bbcode-i">always</span> have to be in quotes, or single-quotes. I use the term ‘single-quotes’ as opposed to apostrophes because you are still quoting the string with it. If your text is not inside quotations, then you will receive an error!</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section23]2.3 - Arithmetic[/anchor][/size][/center]</p>
<p>Variables may also be used in arithmetic sequences. It’s just like punching it into your calculator, it’s so simple! You have assignments that you would need to apply to make it an arithmetic sequence. You would use + for addition, - for subtraction, / for division, * for multiplication, and % for modulo. In the example below, you will see a list of variables with their names corresponding to their actions. Read the names of these variables, or the comments above them, to see exactly what each variable is doing:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>//This variable is adding two numbers<br>
$additionVariable = 1 + 2; //value would be 3</p>
<p>//This variable is subtracting two numbers<br>
$subtractionVariable = 2 - 1; //value would be 1</p>
<p>//This variable is multiplying two numbers<br>
$multiplicationVariable = 1 * 2; //value would be 2</p>
<p>//This variable is dividing two numbers<br>
$divisionVariable = 2 / 1; //value would be 2</p>
<p>//This variable is a simple mathematic sequence<br>
$mathematicVariable = 2 * 4 / (1+1) - 4; //value would be 0</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section24]2.4 - Echo &amp; Print[/anchor]<br>
[/size][/center]<br>
Now, if you’re reading this and understand PHP to an extent, you may ask, “why is the echo part in the variables section?” Well, my friend, I have to have some place to put it! I didn’t want it to have it’s own section, so I figured after teaching people variables, I can show them how to call them. So, to start off, the echo statement is what outputs data onto the user’s screen. So, if you were to put:  echo ‘Hello!’; all you would see on the screen was “Hello!”. Print, however, is virtually the exact same. The only difference is, print has a return value of 1, whereas echo has no return value. Allowing you to use the print statement in expressions. If you wanted to call one of the arithmetic variables in the example above, all you would have to do is add a simple echo statement in the line below. Like so:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>//This variable is adding two numbers<br>
$additionVariable = 1 + 2; //value would be 3</p>
<p>//This variable is subtracting two numbers<br>
$subtractionVariable = 2 - 1; //value would be 1</p>
<p>//This variable is multiplying two numbers<br>
$multiplicationVariable = 1 * 2; //value would be 2</p>
<p>//This variable is dividing two numbers<br>
$divisionVariable = 2 / 1; //value would be 2</p>
<p>//This variable is a simple mathematic sequence<br>
$mathematicVariable = 2 * 4 / (1+1) - 4; //value would be 0</p>
<p>echo $subtractionVariable; //this would print the value of your variable ‘subtractionVariable’</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]</p>
<p>Though, you do not have to echo or print variables if you don’t want to. You can easily just write a string of text onto the screen without calling it from anywhere using something like this:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>//Time to print our first line!<br>
echo ‘Hello world!’;</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
From this, all that would display onto the screen would be: Hello world!</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section25]2.5 - Putting it all together![/anchor]<br>
[/size][/center]<br>
Now that we’ve learned the basics of variables and how to call them - let’s write some basic code that will mix all of this together! It may sound challenging, but fret not! What you’ve just learned is some of the most basics that will be used everyday in PHP. You’ll remember these little things quite easily, and once you take a look at the code example below, you will see exactly why:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>//Indicate your variable(s)<br>
$myName = “Example”;<br>
$myAge = 23;<br>
$sequence = 4 * 12 / 2;</p>
<p>//Call your variable(s) via echo<br>
echo “Hello! My name is $myName, I am $myAge years old.<br>I’ve been asked to find out the value of 4 * 12 / 2 which would equal to: $sequence”;</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
This would output to:</p>
<p>Hello! My name is Example, and I am 23 years old.<br>
I’ve been asked to find out the value of 4 * 12 / 2 which would equal to: 24</p>
<p>As you can see, in your echo you can apply variables to it without breaking the line of text you are outputting. Also, you are able to add HTML code within your echo statements, providing more organization to your outputs. However, in a case where you would need to have a break in your quotes, you would simply use periods to inform the server that you are making additions into this quote from elsewhere. For an example of this:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>//Indicate your variable<br>
$exampleVariable = “Example”;</p>
<p>//Call your variable(s) via echo<br>
echo "This is my example text: " . $exampleVariable . “!”;</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]</p>
<p>This would print: This is my example text: Example!</p>

        <p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">[size=6][anchor=section3]3 - Comparisons[/anchor][/size]</span>[/center]</p>
<p>In this section, you will learn how to compare two things in PHP. This is an absolute essential for everyday programming. If you don’t know how to compare, you won’t make it very far. Here, you will learn how to compare integers, strings, and even learn new statements! Hopefully you’ll be in for it, because now we’re getting into elements just a little more advanced. For an example of this:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php<br>
$name = “John”;</p>
<p>if ($name == “Jasmine”) {<br>
echo “Hey, how’s it going!?”;<br>
} else {<br>
echo “Who are you?”;<br>
}<br>
?&gt;[/code]<br>
But for now, let’s get back to the basics!</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section31]3.1 - Comparison expressions[/anchor]<br>
[/size][/center]<br>
Now, in order to compare, you will need to know the expressions to do so. These expressions will always evaluate out to ‘true’ or ‘false’. These are some of the most commonly used expressions in the programming world, and here’s what they are:</p>
<p>[ul][<em>]== / is equal to<br>
[</em>]&gt;= / is greater-than or equal to<br>
[<em>]&lt;= / is less-than or equal to<br>
[</em>]&gt; / is greater-than<br>
[<em>]&lt; / is less-than<br>
[</em>]!= / not equal to<br>
[<em>]=== / is equal to and same type<br>
[</em>]!== / is not equal to or same time[/ul]</p>
<p>You may wonder, ‘what do those last two in the list mean?’ Well, quite simply, it’s to find out if a certain variable is equal to the same type of something else. However, these are commonly used in if statements, which have not yet been explained. Regardless, I will teach you these now. So, for example, if you want to make sure that a variable is equal to 30 and is an integer at the same time, you would use the === expression. Here’s a code snippet example:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>//Setting the variable<br>
$myVar = 30;</p>
<p>//Calling your if statement<br>
if ($myVar === 30) {<br>
echo “Yep, that’s an int that equals 30!”;<br>
} else {<br>
echo “Incorrect.”;<br>
}</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
The result of this would be: Yep, that’s an int that equals 30!</p>
<p>Now that you’ve learned what each expression means, how do we apply them? If you hadn’t figured it out based on my two if statement examples above: with if statements! Let’s continue onto the next section.</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section32]3.2 - The if statement[/anchor][/size][/center]</p>
<p>If you’re following this guide to the dot, then you’ve already seen me use an example of an if/else statement. In here, we’re going to discuss exactly what “if” does. The if statement sends information to the server regarding whether a current state is true, or false; depending on your comparison expressions you set. If the statement is receiving the value it’s looking for, then it will proceed with an action. If not, then it will return nothing. For example:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>//Two basic variables<br>
$a;<br>
$b;</p>
<p>//These two equal one another<br>
$a = $b;</p>
<p>//‘If’ these two variables equal each other, it will return a bit of text<br>
if ($a == $b) {<br>
echo “That’s true!”;<br>
}</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
This would print: That’s true!<br>
However, if you wanted to ensure that this if statement happens <span class="bbcode-i">only if</span> the two variables did <span class="bbcode-u">not</span> equal each other, you would instead use this:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>//Two basic variables<br>
$a;<br>
$b;</p>
<p>//These two equal one another<br>
$a = $b;</p>
<p>//‘If’ these two variables do not equal each other, it will return a bit of text<br>
if ($a != $b) {<br>
echo “That’s true!”;<br>
}</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
As you can see, our comparison expression changed from example 1, to example 2. In example one, the if statement was checking to see is $a was equal to $b (==); and with our variable statement we made beforehand - that made it true! So, it printed the line. However, in this example, the if statement was checking to see if $a <span class="bbcode-i">did not</span> equal $b. And because variable $a was equal to $b, then the statement was false; thus no line was printed.</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section33]3.3 - What <span class="bbcode-i">else</span>!?[/anchor][/size][/center]</p>
<p>What if you wanted to have some sort of output if the conditions are not met in your if statement? Well, that’s where the else statement comes in handy. As you’ve seen in my first example on if statements, you may have seen that line of code that says, ‘} else {’. What this means is - if these conditions are met, an action will be performed. However, when the conditions are not met - this is where the else statement applies it’s action. For example, let’s make an else action display on screen:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>//Simple boolean variable<br>
$a = true;</p>
<p>//If this variable is false, perform an action, ‘else’ perform a different action<br>
if ($a === false) {<br>
echo ‘$a is false’;<br>
} else {<br>
echo ‘$a is true’;<br>
}</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]</p>
<p>The output on screen would be: $a is true.</p>
<p>However, this is not the end of the else statement! You can prolong checkups by searching for another condition if the criteria of the first condition is not met using elseif. This statement allows another if statement to be performed if the predecessor statement’s conditions were not met. For an example of this:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>//Simple int variable<br>
$a = 46;</p>
<p>//If this variable is false, perform an action, ‘else’ perform a different action<br>
if ($a == 50) {<br>
echo ‘$a is 50’;<br>
} elseif ($a != 45) {<br>
$a = 45;<br>
echo ‘$a is now 45’;<br>
}</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
The ladder of checks this does is; first, it checks to see if variable $a is equal to 50. If not, it goes onto the next statement, which is our elseif statement. This then checks to see if variable $a does not equal to 45, and currently - $a is 46. So, this statement sees that $a does indeed not equal 45, so it then changes it to 45, and prints the line, “$a is now 45”; making $a equal to 45.</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section34]3.4 - Combine![/anchor][/size][/center]</p>
<p>Now that you know all the basics, it should be known that you can also compare strings! It’s just as easy as comparing integers or boolean values. Just remember, strings are <span class="bbcode-i">always</span> in quotes. So, now let’s combine all we’ve learned here. If you take a look at the very beginning of section 3, you will see my first example. This is almost a combination of everything we’ve learned so far, all we need to do is just add one thing, and we will be in the go:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php<br>
$name = “John”;</p>
<p>if ($name == “Jasmine”) {<br>
echo “Hey, how’s it going!?”;<br>
} elseif ($name == “John”) {<br>
echo “Hey, John! I haven’t seen you in ages!”;<br>
}<br>
?&gt;[/code]<br>
This would print: Hey, John! I haven’t seen you in ages!</p>

        <p>[center][size=6]<span class="bbcode-b">[anchor=section4]4 - Let’s switch it up![/anchor]<br>
</span>[/size][/center]<br>
Now that we’ve covered if/else statements; what if there’s something you want to add that would go through a large amount of checks depending on the same value? As opposed to writing a mass amount of if/else statements, you could simply run it through a switch statement! Here’s an example of what you’re going to be building:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>switch (2) {<br>
case 0:<br>
echo ‘The value is 0’;<br>
break;<br>
case 1:<br>
echo ‘The value is 1’;<br>
break;<br>
case 2:<br>
echo ‘The value is 2’;<br>
break;<br>
default:<br>
echo “The value isn’t 0, 1 or 2”;<br>
}</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
This would print, The value is 2<br>
As you can see in the parameters of the switch statement, you see that it’s simply “2”. This would mean it would go through the cases until it reaches case 2, then output the action it underlies.</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section41]4.1 - Testing the waters[/anchor]<br>
[/size][/center]<br>
As always, we’re not going to rush anything here. Nice and easy, slow and steady. We need you to learn, not quickly “get this over with”. Each switch statement will be made up of cases. Each case will represent, basically, an if statement. Once you end your case, you will need to (break;) it, showing the server that the case has ended. Once you complete all your cases, you will still need to add your default case. This is there for when every output of your switch would be false, it displays your default case’s action. As it is your default case, breaking this will not be necessary.</p>
<p>You can also choose what you’re switching through, and the properties of the case. If you want to switch through a series of strings, you can do that, if you want to switch through even an array, you can do that! It’s very helpful for when you have a lot of things you’re checking for. Here’s an example of a basic switch statement through strings:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>$fruit = “Apple”;</p>
<p>switch ($fruit) {<br>
case ‘Apple’:<br>
echo “Yummy.”;<br>
break;<br>
default:<br>
echo “None of the above!”;<br>
}</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
As you can see, the switch statement is switching through the cases until it finds the value of variable $fruit. Obviously, the first case is equal to the variable’s value of “Apple”, therefor, it would print: Yummy.</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section42]4.2 - Rack 'em and stack 'em[/anchor][/size][/center]</p>
<p>Another great thing about switch statements is that multiple cases can be applied to the same task! This make things much easier if you want to have the same output for multiple values. Consider the following if statement:</p>
<p><code>  if ($n == 0 || $n == 1 || n == 2) {
    echo '$n is between 0 and 2!';
  } else {
    echo '$n is not found yet';
  }</code><br>
This would check and see if variable $n is equivalent to either 0, 1, or 2. If it is, it would print the string shown in the echo statement. However, there is a much simpler way of doing this, with your switch statement:</p>
<p><code>  switch($n) {
    case 0:
    case 1:
    case 2:
      echo '$n is between 0 and 2!';
      break;
    default:
      echo '$n is not found yet';
  }</code><br>
This would do the same exact thing the if statement provided above does. This could also be applied with strings, and other variables, as I had previously stated. It’s quite a nice feature, and is used very commonly!</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section43]4.3 - Alternative syntax[/anchor]<br>
[/size][/center]<br>
Here, we will kick it back to an earlier section of the tutorial as well. We will learn the alternative syntax for both switch statements, and if statements. “Alternative syntax? What do you mean?” Well, the examples I provided are the most common ways of enacting these statements. However, there’s an alternative route you can go for applying these statements. As opposed to the normal braces, perhaps you can use colons? Take a look at the following:</p>
<p>[code=php]    $fruit = “Apple”;</p>
<pre><code>switch ($fruit):
    case 'Apple':
        echo "Yummy.";
        break;
        default:
            echo "None of the above!";
endswitch;[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, instead of using { } braces as we normally do, we used a colon and ended it with the ‘endswitch;’ statement. You are able to do this for if statements as well:</p>
<p><code>  if ($a == 5):
    echo "a equals 5";
  elseif ($a == 6):
    echo "a equals 6";
  else:
    echo "a is neither 5 nor 6";
  endif;</code><br>
The same applies.</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section44]4.4 - Put it together![/anchor]<br>
[/size][/center]<br>
Now that we’ve learned the basics of a numerous amount of things, perhaps we can put them <span class="bbcode-b">all</span> together and see what we’ve learned so far! Here’s what I got:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>//Our variables; check!<br>
$myName = “Example”;<br>
$myAge = 30;<br>
$isAlive = true;</p>
<p>//Our arithmetic &amp; echo statement; check!<br>
echo 6 * 22 . “<br>”;</p>
<p>//if and switch statements; check!<br>
if ($isAlive === true) {<br>
switch($myName) {<br>
case ‘Example’:<br>
echo “Your name is $myName and you are $myAge years old!”;<br>
break;<br>
default:<br>
echo “Cannot locate ‘Example’.”;<br>
}<br>
} else {<br>
echo “We can’t search you up if you aren’t alive!”;<br>
}</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
The output of this would be:</p>
<p>132<br>
Your name is Example and you are 30 years old!</p>
<p>Congratulations! You’ve finished roughly half of An Introduction to PHP! Keep moving on, you’re learning a lot! We’re going to keep slowly advancing, but I’ll make sure that you have the utilities here in this thread to have a successful start.</p>

        <p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">[size=6][anchor=section5]5 - Arrays[/anchor][/size]</span>[/center]</p>
<p>An array can help with your organization when you have long lists. An array is actually an <span class="bbcode-i">object</span>, so there is a little object-orientation with PHP; but we’ll get to that later! As opposed to generating hundreds to thousands of variables - simply store it in one array!</p>
<p>Think about it this way; an array is like a list of items (for example; a shopping list). You don’t want to put each item on it’s own page (a variable), that’s a huge waste of paper! However, if you put your entire list onto one page (the array), then things will be a lot more organized and more efficient.</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section51]5.1 - How does it all work?[/anchor]<br>
[/size][/center]<br>
Well, if you’re following this guide all the way through, you would probably remember me telling you that you can apply your variables to be arrays. Yes, I’m finally explaining it to you! You know how variables can become integers, strings, mathematical sequences, and etc. You know how to apply them in if and switch statements. However, this is where things get a little trickier.</p>
<p>An array is, as briefly explained in the previous section, is a list of items. Whereas you could write hundreds of lines of variables and call upon those - or you could simply make an array. Take a look at the following:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>//Your very first array! Congratulations!<br>
$myArray = array(“Chips”, “Salsa”, “Rice”, “Corn” );</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
As you can see - the array starts exactly as a variable. You start it with your dollar sign, followed by the name of your variable, then the equal sign. That’s because… You guessed it! It <span class="bbcode-i">is</span> a variable! You’re just designating it to be an array.</p>
<p>To declare it as an array, you need to first act as if you’re just making a regular ol’ variable. Once you’ve gotten passed the '$myVariable = ’ part, this is when it gets different! Once you’ve done this, you’ll want to designate the array. To do this, it’s simple as, “array(  );” Each item in your list will be separated by quotations and commas. So, from my example, you can see exactly this for each list.</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section52]5.2 - To access an array[/anchor][/size][/center]</p>
<p>Now that you understand how these arrays work - it’s time to find out how you call on these arrays! To do this, it’s quite simple. You can either access them by Offset with braces, <span class="bbcode-i">or</span> brackets! Simply call your variable followed by either your brackets or braces. For an example of this:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>$myArray = array(“Chips”, “Salsa”, “Rice”, “Corn” );</p>
<p>echo $myArray[0];</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
This would simply print: Chips.</p>
<p>Now, you can replace the brackets in the echo statement calling the variable with braces, and it would perform the same action. You may wonder, however, what that number means inside the brackets. Well, this number represents which item(s) that I want to call from the array! By default, the first item’s identification number will always be 0, and you would increase it from then on for further items. So, if you were wanting to call the “Rice” item, you would use $myArray[2]; - and this would print that item.</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section53]5.3 - Modify, delete, sort, and push your array[/anchor][/size][/center]</p>
<p>Well, you know how to create and call on a simple array. How about when you need to modify your array further down the road? Well, to do this; all you would need to do is declare the variable, the item’s number, and simply make it equal to a different result. Just like changing an integer variable! Take a look at the code below:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>$myArray = array(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 );</p>
<p>echo $myArray[3];</p>
<p>$myArray[3] = 15;</p>
<p>echo “<br>” . $myArray[3];</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
This would output:<br>
40<br>
15</p>
<p>Simple as that! These features for arrays are always beneficial in a case where it’s dependent on a user’s input. Though, what if you need to delete a section, or item, of an array? Well, honestly; that’s easier than modifying an element of one! All you need to do is use the ‘unset’ statement, declaring your variable and the identification number of the item you want deleted. So, for example:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>$myArray = array(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 );</p>
<p>echo $myArray[3];<br>
unset($myArray[3]);<br>
echo “<br>” . $myArray[3];</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
This would print:<br>
40<br>
50</p>
<p>So, as you could see in that example, deleting the element of the array causes the next element in your array to take the place of it’s predecessor. Pretty neat, huh? Though, in a scenario where you want to sort your array by numerical or alphabetical order… How would one do this? Well - with 'sort’ing it! Just one simple statement, and it is then placed in numerical <span class="bbcode-i">or</span> alphabetical order! It depends on what you choose your array to be! Take a gander down below, and see an example of this:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>$myArray = array(“Z”, “B”, “Y”, “A” );</p>
<p>echo $myArray[0];</p>
<p>sort($myArray);</p>
<p>echo “<br>” . $myArray[0];</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
This would print:<br>
Z<br>
A</p>
<p>As you can see, Z was the first option in the array. Though, when the second echo was called, why was A the first? Well, you see, we sorted the array! This detects whether it is alphabetical or numerical, then sorts it regarding the first number(s) or letter(s) in this array. However, there is also a reverse order to this sorting method - ‘rsort’. Very cleverly named, yes? Take a look at the example below!</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>$myArray = array(“Z”, “B”, “Y”, “A” );</p>
<p>echo $myArray[1];</p>
<p>rsort($myArray);</p>
<p>echo “<br>” . $myArray[1];</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
This would print:<br>
B<br>
Y</p>
<p>Now, just like the sorting method, you see that B is the second item in the array. So, we called that - as you can tell! Though, in the second echo, Y was instead printed. This is because we <span class="bbcode-i">reverse sorted</span> it. This is a neat feature you can use if you ever want to reverse alphabetically/numerically sort an array. Instead of sorting it dominantly, it takes the last letter(s) or number(s) in cycle and sorts it last-to-first.</p>
<p>What if later down the road you’d like to add something to your array? For this, you would use your ‘array_push’ method. This allows you to add elements to your array with ease! So, for example, if you’re working on, let’s say, a turn-based game providential to array-based saving, then <span class="bbcode-i">array_push</span> could come in handy! Observe the following:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>$stack = array(“grape”, “cherry”);</p>
<p>array_push($stack, “orange”, “coconut”);</p>
<p>print_r($stack);</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
The output would print: Array ( [0] = grape [1] = cherry [2] = orange [3] = coconut )<br>
Nifty, right? This could come in all sorts of handiness when necessary. I promise, you’ll be glad that you remember how to do this!</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section54]5.4 - The associative array[/anchor][/size][/center]</p>
<p>So thus far, you’ve learned to construct an array, sort it, push it, delete items in it, and call it via integer. However, in the case of you wanting to be more descriptive of your data, you could use something called an ‘associative array’. Some languages, such as Java, do not view associative arrays to be arrays - and separate them away from any correspondence. For example; Java calls these and utilizes them as ‘maps’. However, PHP treats them as the same as an array. It makes use of <span class="bbcode-i">key =&gt; item</span> pairs which make organization much more simple. For example of a difference between the two arrays:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>//First, the normal array<br>
$myArray = array( “Item1”, “Item2”, “Item3” );</p>
<p>//Now we call it<br>
echo $myArray[1];</p>
<p>//Time for our associative array<br>
$myAssocArray = array( ‘Item1’ =&gt; ‘Value of item1’,<br>
‘Item2’ =&gt; ‘Value of item2’,<br>
‘Item3’ =&gt; ‘Value of item3’ );</p>
<p>//Now we call it<br>
echo “<br>” . $myAssocArray[‘Item2’];</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
This would print:<br>
Item2<br>
Value of item2</p>
<p>So, as you can see in this example - we give each item in our list an identification <span class="bbcode-i">title</span>, as opposed to it having a number. It can be used for readability and organization. Which would be easier to read; a normal array, or an associative array? The answer is obvious!</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section55]5.5 - Using it as a map[/anchor][/size][/center]</p>
<p>Associative arrays, just like Java, are often called <span class="bbcode-i">maps</span>. These are because as opposed to a specific number relation, it uses a defined key. How much tougher would it be to travel from a map, whether it be an online map, an app, or just a standard paper-map, if it was numerically coordinated? So, in a sense, if you’re using an associative array - then you’re already using a map! Congratulations! So, for an example, have a look below:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>$myAssocArray = array(‘year’ =&gt; 2015,<br>
‘color’ =&gt; ‘red’,<br>
‘doors’ =&gt; 4,<br>
‘make’ =&gt; ‘Nissan’);</p>
<p>echo "My car is a, " . $myAssocArray[‘make’] . " and was made in " . $myAssocArray[‘year’];</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
This would print: My car is a Nissan and was made in 2015<br>
As you can see, this form of array is very beneficial for <span class="bbcode-i">map</span>ping your code and making it more readable.</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section56]5.6 - Multiple dimensions![/anchor][/size][/center]</p>
<p>What you may have not knows was:  Arrays can store multiple arrays, causing them to become <span class="bbcode-i">multidimensional arrays</span>. These are especially useful for, say, designating a deck of cards to an array. This way, you could have each card in coordination to their face. Whether it be a 2 of diamonds, or a 9 of spades - this can be done with a <span class="bbcode-i">multidimensional array</span>. Take a look:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>$deck = array(array(‘2 of Diamonds’, 2),<br>
array(‘8 of Spades’, 8),<br>
array(‘4 of Hearts’, 4),<br>
array(‘5 of Diamonds’, 5),<br>
array(‘7 of Diamonds’, 7),<br>
array(‘2 of Spades’, 2));</p>
<p>//Pretend the first card drawn was the 4 of Hearts:<br>
echo 'You have the ’ . $deck[2][0] . ‘!’;</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
Now, this is only a two-dimensional array. There can be as many dimensions as you want, but if you exceed five dimensions in your array, it might get a little tough to manage. However, as you can see from the example, we call this in ‘rows’ and ‘columns’. The first bracket defines your row, the second would define your column. If you were to add more dimensions to this, you would add more brackets.</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section57]5.7 - Mash it all together![/anchor][/size][/center]</p>
<p>Now that you understand your arrays, I want to know if you can put it all together! Learning interactively is statistically the best way of learning, so hopefully, if you’re following this tutorial to the dot, you are doing just that! I know it may be boring, but it’s worth it in the long run, I can assure you. So, if you put everything you’ve learned in this section together, then you should come up with something like this:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>//A standard array<br>
$myArray = array( “Example A”, “Example B”, “Example C” );</p>
<p>//Calling it<br>
echo $myArray[1] . “<br>”;</p>
<p>//Then - associative array<br>
$myAssocArray = array( ‘fruit’ =&gt; ‘Apple’,<br>
‘veggy’ =&gt; ‘Carrot’,<br>
‘candy’ =&gt; ‘Chocolate’ );</p>
<p>//Now we call it<br>
echo $myAssocArray[‘candy’] . “<br>”;</p>
<p>//Finally, our multidimensional array<br>
$deck = array(array(‘2 of Diamonds’, 2),<br>
array(‘8 of Spades’, 8),<br>
array(‘4 of Hearts’, 4),<br>
array(‘5 of Diamonds’, 5),<br>
array(‘7 of Diamonds’, 7),<br>
array(‘2 of Spades’, 2));</p>
<p>//Calling an array yet again<br>
echo 'You have the ’ . $deck[2][0] . ‘!’;</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
This would output:<br>
Example B<br>
Carrot<br>
You have the 4 of Hearts!</p>
<p>So, as you can tell, arrays are a huge part of PHP and any sort of development in general. If you can’t use an array, then you likely won’t make it very far. Now, don’t get anything distorted - there are times to use arrays, and times to avoid them. However, there tends to be more times to use them, than avoidance.</p>

        <p>[center][size=6]<span class="bbcode-b">[anchor=section6]6 - The loop[/anchor]</span><br>
[/size] [/center]<br>
Sometimes, you’ll encounter a tough time when developing. Especially when you are designated a task that requires the same task to be ran over and over. Let’s say we want to print a list containing all the months of the year; I, for example, would use something like this to do so:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<pre><code>      $months = array("January",
      "February", "March",
      "April", "May",
      "June", "July",
      "August", "September",
      "November", "October", "December" );
    
      foreach ($months as $month) {
          echo "&lt;li&gt;$month&lt;/li&gt;";
      }
</code></pre>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
This would print:</p>
<p>[ul][<em>]January<br>
[</em>]February<br>
[<em>]March<br>
[</em>]April<br>
[<em>]May<br>
[</em>]June<br>
[<em>]July<br>
[</em>]August<br>
[<em>]September<br>
[</em>]November<br>
[<em>]October<br>
[</em>]December[/ul]</p>
<p>That, my friends, would be looping an array. We’ll get to that in the meantime. For now, let’s focus on the for loop:</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section61]6.1 - The for loop[/anchor][/size][/center]</p>
<p>So, as you’ve seen me provide an example of a for loop already (well, you saw me use the foreach loop, but it’s deprived off of the norm - for loop), you can see that you are able to loop through arrays. Great for a list, am I right? Well, before we get into that, let’s just start with the basics. Say you want to print the numbers 1 through 20 on separate lines:  Instead of writing twenty echo statements, or just one with twenty <br> tags, you could write a simple three-liner - like so:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>// Echoes twenty numbers<br>
for ($i = 1; $i &lt;= 20; $i = $i++) {<br>
echo $i . “<br>”;<br>
}</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
This would print:<br>
1<br>
2<br>
3<br>
4<br>
5<br>
6<br>
7<br>
8<br>
9<br>
10<br>
11<br>
12<br>
13<br>
14<br>
15<br>
16<br>
17<br>
18<br>
19<br>
20</p>
<p>So, as opposed to writing twenty lines of echoes to do this - you could simply write just one easy for loop. This can make things much easier when you have a large loop to go through; or even if you just have a small loop to go through. It’s more efficient to use than to write, say, three echo lines.</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section62]6.2 - Looping an array causes something new[/anchor][/size][/center]</p>
<p>As you have seen in an earlier example, looping an array causes you to use the <span class="bbcode-i">foreach</span> element. This means - for each item in your variable; this happens. This makes it much easier for you to print a list of items. Just like in my earlier example:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php<br>
$months = array(“January”,<br>
“February”, “March”,<br>
“April”, “May”,<br>
“June”, “July”,<br>
“August”, “September”,<br>
“November”, “October”, “December” );</p>
<pre><code>  foreach ($months as $month) {
      echo "&lt;li&gt;$month&lt;/li&gt;";
  }
</code></pre>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
And just like before, this will output:</p>
<p>[ul][<em>]January<br>
[</em>]February<br>
[<em>]March<br>
[</em>]April<br>
[<em>]May<br>
[</em>]June<br>
[<em>]July<br>
[</em>]August<br>
[<em>]September<br>
[</em>]November<br>
[<em>]October<br>
[</em>]December[/ul]</p>
<p>As you can see in the example above - this <span class="bbcode-i">foreach</span> loop sets it’s own parameters. It first generates it’s own parameters <span class="bbcode-i">as</span> (using the built in method that the language provides) a custom parameter the statement makes. So, as you can see, you use array $months <span class="bbcode-i">as</span> new variable $month - indicating each individual item the array provides. You can also loop associative arrays, check down below:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>$cake = array( ‘large cake’ =&gt; 'I do ',<br>
‘medium cake’ =&gt; 'I do ',<br>
‘small cake’ =&gt; 'I do not ’ );</p>
<p>foreach ($cake as $size=&gt;$decision) {<br>
echo $decision . 'want a ’ . $size . ‘<br>’;<br>
}</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
This would print:<br>
I do want a large cake<br>
I do want a medium cake<br>
I do not want a small cake</p>
<p>Looping is so cool, right? It makes things so much easier to perform than a whole bunch of unnecessary code you could use for just this! Man-o-man, could you just imagine all the if/else statements that would be required for all of that? Would rather just loop it!</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section63]6.3 - While this… Maybe this?[/anchor][/size][/center]</p>
<p>Maybe you want to loop until a certain condition is equal to a certain value? While this condition is false, it will continue looping until it is true. Hence, for this, you’d need to use your ‘while’ loop. I know, they are so creative in naming their methods! Either way, it’s still the same, if not wildly similar, as in other programming languages such as Java, Python, or the C-languages. Take a look down below:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>$headCount = 0;<br>
$flipCount = 0;</p>
<p>while ($headCount &lt; 3) {<br>
$flip = rand(0,1);<br>
$flipCount ++;<br>
if ($flip) {<br>
$headCount++;<br>
echo “H”;<br>
} else {<br>
$headCount = 0;<br>
echo “T”;<br>
}<br>
}<br>
echo “</p><p>It took {$flipCount} flips!</p>”;
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
This would display the amount of times it would take to reach three consecutive ‘head flips’ in a row. As long as there aren’t three “H['s]” displaying on screen, it would keep looping until it reaches three H’s in a row. <span class="bbcode-i">While</span> this condition is false, it will continue looping until it reaches proper standards. So, <span class="bbcode-i">while loops</span> are great for loops that you don’t know when will end. Hence the example above. If we were to flip a coin until we received three head placements in a consecutive sequence, we wouldn’t necessarily know when to stop this loop. That’s basically why the while loop was created.</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section64]6.4 - How do you do?[/anchor][/size][/center]</p>
<p>Now that you understand <span class="bbcode-i">while loops</span>, it’s time to learn - <span class="bbcode-i">how do you do this while this statement remains false</span>? This is where the ‘do’ part of the while loop comes in handy. You may have noticed that the <span class="bbcode-i">while loop</span> checks the condition before each individual iteration. What if you wanted to check this <span class="bbcode-i">after</span> each iteration? Well, that’s exactly what the <span class="bbcode-i">do statement</span> can do for you. If you look at the following:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>$flipCount = 0;</p>
<pre><code>do {
  $flip = rand(0,1);
  $flipCount ++;
    if ($flip) {
      echo "H";
    } else {
      echo "T";
    }
} while ($flip);
  $verb = "were";
  $last = "flips";
    if ($flipCount == 1) {
      $verb = "was";
      $last = "flip";
  }
</code></pre>
<p>echo “</p><p>There {$verb} {$flipCount} {$last}!</p>”;
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
This code will keep flipping as long as the result is heads. As long as the result is heads, it flips until there is tails. So, you shouldn’t expect more than just two to four outputs on this loop.</p>

        <p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">[size=6][anchor=section7]7 - Onto functions![/anchor][/size]</span>[/center]</p>
<p>Functions are reusable bits of code, saving you much copying and pasting. Yes, one thing to know as a developer, copying and pasting may be a common part of your career. Why would you write out a whole block of code that’s just as efficient as the one you’ve seen online - that you could copy and paste? Why rewrite the same code that you’ve already written, as opposed to simply copying that function?</p>
<p>PHP has a wide variety of built-in functions that we’ll be learning. You’ve already learned some of them, most of which being in your arrays section. That matters nay, however! I will teach you these functions and how to apply them, even in OOP! But, we’ll get to OOP in section 8, which is our final section. Take a look below:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>//An example variable we will be using in this subsection<br>
$myName = “Example”;</p>
<p>//The substr function allows you to receive a snippet of your string variable<br>
$partial = substr($myName, 0, 4);</p>
<p>print $partial;</p>
<p>echo “<br>”;</p>
<p>//The strtoupper simply makes your whole string uppercase<br>
$upper = strtoupper($myName);</p>
<p>print $upper;</p>
<p>echo “<br>”;</p>
<p>//The strtolower function does the exact opposite of strtoupper<br>
$lower = strtolower($myName);</p>
<p>print $lower;</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
This would print:<br>
Exam<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
example</p>
<p>Now, as you can see, these built in functions can help with your - eh; functionality. You’ll always want your website to be functional to the best of it’s abilities. And the best of it’s abilities can be basically the best of PHP’s abilities. I know that there are other languages that enhance the scripting language of PHP such as JavaScript and MySQL - but that’s beside the point!</p>
<p>Alternatively, functions can have <span class="bbcode-i">parameters</span>. These tell the function if there is data that it needs to check over. This can come in handy if one is trying to call an instance of this method more smoothly, calling in the <span class="bbcode-i">arguments</span> required for the given function.</p>
<p>Functions can also <span class="bbcode-i">return</span> statements as their actions. You can make these return statements variables that you’ve already set, or that you plan to change in the future. Below, see the following example:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>$name;</p>
<p>function returnName() {<br>
return $name = “Example”;<br>
}</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
Now, perhaps if you were to call this method via echo statement, it would return an “Example” value.</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section71]7.1 - Time to put arrays in them![/anchor][/size][/center]</p>
<p>Putting arrays in functions is as easy as ever. Basically, you just make an array. It’s virtually it’s own function as is! Just join the array with a print statement, and that’s an official function. If you’ll take a gander on the example below, you’ll know exactly what I mean:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>//Name your function<br>
function arrayFunction() {<br>
//Create an array with several elements in it,<br>
//then sort it and print the joined elements to the screen<br>
$the_array = array(“Banana”, “Peach”, “Mango”, “Apple”, “Cherry”);</p>
<pre><code>sort($the_array);

print join(", ", $the_array);
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>arrayFunction();</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
So, as you can see in the example above, joining the array with the statement ‘<span class="bbcode-i">print join</span>’, you can join these arrays by separation based on whatever you decide to separate it with. Whether it be by slashes, periods, commas, or anything! The output of this would be:<br>
Apple, Banana, Cherry, Mango, Peach<br>
And as you already know the rsort method, then you shan’t worry about all the little nicknacks!</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section72]7.2 - Calling these functions[/anchor]<br>
[/size][/center]<br>
If you’re coming from an OOP language, then these parts of the tutorial should be nothing more than a cakewalk. Calling these functions is the easy part. Making them - now that’s the real challenge. However, I’ll let you figure out the more advanced functions that you’re able to construct. In this tutorial - we’ll only cover the basics. So, to call these functions, all you’ll need to do is list the function followed by the parameters if necessary. Take a look at the example below:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>$name = “Example”;</p>
<pre><code>function greetings($name) {
    echo "Greetings, " . $name . "!";
}
</code></pre>
<p>greetings($name);</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
This would print: Greetings, Example!</p>
<p>As you can see, if you parameters are set to an existing variable, it would draw the data from said variable and print it onto the screen via echo statement. However, you can make functions into object-orientation; they are mainly designed as scripts via PHP. There are many wonders you can do with this language, just keep researching beyond this tutorial, and you’ll surely find out!</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section73]7.3 - Messing with parameters[/anchor]<br>
[/size][/center]<br>
Now that you know how to build and call these functions, but they definitely need to be able to take in some input. If they couldn’t, that would just be fairly redundant. This is when <span class="bbcode-i">parameters</span> come in handy. Take a look below:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>$name = “Example”;</p>
<p>function greet($input) {<br>
echo "Greetings, " . $input . “!”;<br>
}</p>
<p>greet($name);</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
This would print: Greetings, Example!<br>
See how in the parenthesis you are naming a new variable $input? Well, this is telling the function that it needs to collect some sort of data in order to process. By calling your method with the variable $name within the parenthesis is just how it’s done. It could be very useful for, say, you want to save an array publicly, but need to call it for the given function.</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section74]7.4 - Apply it![/anchor]<br>
[/size][/center]<br>
Now that we’ve gotten functions down, we need to recap over what we’ve learned. Apply everything you’ve learned - try to shoot for something fancy! Don’t be dull and boring like I am below:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>function arrayFunction() {<br>
//Create an array with several elements in it,<br>
//then sort it and print the joined elements to the screen<br>
$the_array = array(“Banana”, “Peach”, “Mango”, “Apple”, “Cherry”);</p>
<pre><code>sort($the_array);

print join(", ", $the_array);
</code></pre>

        <p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">[size=6][anchor=section8]8 - PHP is also OO![/anchor][/size]</span>[/center]<br>
A wonderful thing about PHP is that it is, too, OOP. Before we start:  What is OOP? Well, object-oriented programming (<span class="bbcode-i">OOP</span>) is a language that bases it’s concept on “object”, which is data, typically in the form of <span class="bbcode-i">fields</span>, built in structures and contain code in procedures; known as <span class="bbcode-i">methods</span>.</p>
<p>Distinguishably, OOP languages have a feature where an object’s procedure can access and often alter the data within correspondence. This can be very useful for when you need to access an object with ease. You would have to construct your properties and set your parameters, however, but that’s easy!</p>
<p>However, most OOP languages are class-based, meaning objects are instances of the given class. Don’t let that fool you! There is much diversity in OO languages. Take a look at an example of OO programming in PHP below:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>//Creating the class<br>
class Person {</p>
<p>//Creating the properties<br>
public $firstName;<br>
public $lastName;<br>
public $age;</p>
<p>//Assigning the values<br>
public function __construct($firstName, $lastName, $age) {<br>
$this-&gt;firstName = $firstName;<br>
$this-&gt;lastName = $lastName;<br>
$this-&gt;age = $age;<br>
}</p>
<pre><code>//Creating a method
public function greet() {
  return "Hello, my name is " . $this-&gt;firstName . " " . $this-&gt;lastName . ". I am " . $this-&gt;age . " years old!";
}
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>//Create a new Person<br>
$newPerson = new Person(‘Example’, ‘Last Name’, 22);</p>
<p>//Greeting the newPerson<br>
echo $newPerson-&gt;greet();</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
This would print: Hello, my name is Example Last Name. I am 22 years old!<br>
Pretty neat, right? Review the code and try to see how it’s doing this. If you figure it out, you’ll probably think that it’s pretty cool. OO is a very functional style of programming. If you can’t figure it out, don’t worry and just read the text explaining it below.</p>
<p>This calls your object, or <span class="bbcode-i">instance</span> from the properties designated in the function you’re calling from class Person. In the <span class="bbcode-i">__construct</span> function, you would declare your parameters to set the variables that are associated with the constructor.</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section81]8.1 - Time for class[/anchor][/size][/center]</p>
<p>Classes are an absolute essential for OOP. It is your foundation to your data structure. So, I suppose it really <span class="bbcode-i">is</span> the ‘structure’ part. You will declare your variables here publicly and call them in your instance after constructing them - making them your properties. When you want to utilize these properties, you will need to add a function to the class and call it with your instance. However, for now, take a look at the following:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>//Your first class!<br>
class Person {</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>//Your first instance!<br>
$newPerson = new Person();</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
You have now generated an empty class and a blank slate of an instance. To make use of these, you will need to assign properties.</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section82]8.2 - Use of properties[/anchor][/size][/center]</p>
<p>To make your properties, it’s as easy as declaring a <span class="bbcode-i">public variable</span>. This would be useful for when you need not any parameters for your instance to utilize it. For example, an if statement would be a great time to use this. Take a look at the following:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>class Person {</p>
<pre><code>public $isAlive = true;
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>$newPerson = new Person();</p>
<p>if ($newPerson-&gt;isAlive) {<br>
echo “It’s alive!”;<br>
}</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
This would print: It’s alive!<br>
As you can see, once you declare your boolean variable, you can call on it. It makes use of <span class="bbcode-i">instance-&gt;property</span> to check these. If you look closely, you’ll see that you in fact do not use a dollar sign to call your property values.</p>
<p>Now, if you wanted your instance to have specific properties for each object, then you would need to set your parameters. To do this, you would need to use your <span class="bbcode-i">__construct</span> method. This declares variables as specific properties for it’s instant. Perfect, right? Have a look down below:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>class Person {</p>
<p>public $firstName;<br>
public $lastName;<br>
public $age;</p>
<p>public function __construct($firstName, $lastName, $age) {<br>
$this-&gt;firstName = $firstName;<br>
$this-&gt;lastName = $lastName;<br>
$this-&gt;age = $age;<br>
}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>$newPerson = new Person(‘Example’, ‘Last Name’, 22);</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
Now, this makes it to where your instant $newPerson is now under the parameters ‘Example’, ‘Last Name’, and 22. This is due to the function in the class. This <span class="bbcode-i">__construct</span> function follows with parameters for the class, and to declare them; it uses <span class="bbcode-i">$this-&gt;variable = $parameter</span>.</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section83]8.3 - Throw a method in the matter[/anchor][/size][/center]<br>
Now, what if you wanted to make a custom action in your class for a specific instant? Well, you can do it just as easy as making a simple function! However, this function would typically receive the data based on the properties of the given class. Look below:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>class Person {</p>
<p>public $firstName;<br>
public $lastName;<br>
public $age;</p>
<p>public function __construct($firstName, $lastName, $age) {<br>
$this-&gt;firstName = $firstName;<br>
$this-&gt;lastName = $lastName;<br>
$this-&gt;age = $age;<br>
}</p>
<pre><code>public function greet() {
  return "Hello, my name is " . $this-&gt;firstName . " " . $this-&gt;lastName . ". I am " . $this-&gt;age . " years old!";
}
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>$newPerson = new Person(‘Example’, ‘Last Name’, 22);</p>
<p>echo $newPerson-&gt;greet();</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
This would print: Hello, my name is Example Last Name. I am 22 years old!<br>
As you can see, the function declares the input of the properties the construct method set. Making use of the very same <span class="bbcode-i">$this-&gt;variable</span>. Then, since it’s drawing the properties, it reads the properties set in the instance calling it. And to call the method, you use, <span class="bbcode-i">$instant-&gt;method()</span>.</p>
<p>[center][size=6][anchor=section84]8.4 - The final chapter[/anchor][/size][/center]</p>
<p>Now that you’ve learned the basics of OOP, let’s see what you’ve learned! Try to be innovative and venture down from everything you’ve learned in this tutorial. You’ll be amazed at some of the things you can accomplish! However, for a review of this section, take a look at my following example:</p>
<p>[code=php]&lt;?php</p>
<p>class Person {</p>
<pre><code>public $isAlive = true;
public $firstName;
public $lastName;
public $age;
        
 public function __construct($firstName, $lastName, $age) {
   $this-&gt;firstName = $firstName;
   $this-&gt;lastName = $lastName;
   $this-&gt;age = $age;
 }
        
public function greet() {
  return "Hello, my name is " . $this-&gt;firstName . " " . $this-&gt;lastName . ". I am " . $this-&gt;age . " years old!";
}
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>$newPerson = new Person(‘Example’, ‘Last Name’, 22);</p>
<p>if($newPerson-&gt;isAlive) {<br>
echo “It’s alive!”;<br>
}</p>
<p>echo “<br>”;<br>
echo $newPerson-&gt;greet();</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]<br>
This would print:<br>
It’s alive!<br>
Hello, my name is Example Last Name. I am 22 years old!</p>
<p>I hope that everything was all clear in this section. I know that it can sometimes be confusing, but once you get the hang of it, you’ll be on the fly! Though, as you can see, object-orientation is very effective for data.</p>

It seems like all of the main web languages have glaring issues, but maybe I’m just trying to compare them to what they (specifically PHP) are not: C++.

<p>You should definitely check out the next major release of JavaScript/ECMAScript 6 as it introduces major changes to the language and has many people excited over its features. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

See, that’s your problem. You shouldn’t be comparing the languages to C++ lol. They simply just aren’t. However, if I were to point someone in the direction of web development, I would honestly suggest Ruby over PHP. I need to start getting to learning that language more in-depth soon. I’m an amateur when it comes to it, and it seems like a very powerful languages. Albeit, it has it’s problems, but every language does.</p>
