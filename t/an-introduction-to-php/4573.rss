A basic understanding of HTML is required


[ul][*]Installing easyPHP
[*]Your first PHP page
[*]X green bottles sitting on a wall[/ul]


[b][size=3]Installing easyPHP[/size][/b]

In order to use PHP your computer must support the .php file extension. There is a way to install php onto your computer, but when i tried i miserably failed. I found that installing a program that provides you with an envirioment which supports PHP much easier. EasyPHP also has PHPmyadmin and supports mySQL.

Firstly go to the [url=http://www.easyphp.org/telechargements.php3]EasyPHP site[/url] (www.easyphp.org), and download the latest version (at time of posting 1.8), and install the program.

Now open EasyPHP, then go to the directory at which you installed it, and open the folder &quot;EasyPHP1-8&quot; then the &quot;www&quot; folder. In my case the directory of this is:

[code]C:\Program Files\EasyPHP1-8\www[/code]

You can now save files with the .php file extension in this folder.

NOTE: to open the folders you must type &quot;127.0.0.1/&quot; followed by the name of the file you wish to display into the address

[b][size=3]Your first PHP page[/size][/b]

You are now going to create your first PHP page. Sounds difficult? You are totally mistaken. PHP pages are exactly the same as HTML pages with one difference, you can use PHP in them ;D.

PHP is recognised by using the PHP tags.

[code]&lt;?PHP
 //code goes here
?&gt;[/code]

Notice the // before &quot;code goes here&quot;. The // makes the rest of that line a comment, meaning it is completely ignored by the browser.

Open notepad, or any other text editor, and enter the following code

[code]
&lt;html&gt;
  
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;my first PHP page&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;?PHP
      echo &quot;Hello world&quot;; //please take notice of the semicolon, this needs to follow every php statement
    ?&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
[/code]

and save it in the www folder as helloworld.php.

It should look familiar, thats because its almost entirely HTML! Except the code in the middle. Open up Internet explorer (or whatever internet browser you use) and type in:

[code]127.0.0.1/helloworld.php[/code]

What does it show? Right click the background a select view source. The following should be displayed:

[code]
&lt;html&gt;
  
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;my first PHP page&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
Hello world
  &lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
[/code]

As you can see echo &quot;Hello world&quot;; has just printed Hello world. And that concludes your first PHP page! Congratulations.

What you have learnt in this section:


[ul][*] What the PHP tags are
[*] That // comments out the rest of the line within the php tags
[*] That echo displays the whatever follows it
[*] That every PHP statement must be followed by a semicolon[/ul]


[b][size=3]X green bottles sitting on a wall[/size][/b]

A strange title yes, but all will become clear soon.

Im not sure if this nursery(?) rhyme is international, but the people from the UK should have heard of it.

&quot;10 green bottles sitting on a wall,
10 green bottles sitting on a wall,
if 1 green bottle should accidently fall,
there will be 9 green bottles sitting on a wall!&quot;

well you have now. We are going to recreate this nursery rhyme in a webpage for X amount of bottles! How exciting, ;)

Firstly open notepad, then enter the following code:

[code]
&lt;html&gt;
  
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Green Bottles&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;?PHP
  $bottles = 10;
  
  while ($bottles &gt; 0)
    {
    echo &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot; . $bottles . &quot; green bottles sitting on a wall,&quot; .
            &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot; . $bottles . &quot; green bottles sitting on a wall,&quot; .
            &quot;&lt;br /&gt; if one green bottle should accidently fall,&quot;;
           //A BOTTLE HAS FALLEN!!! that means we have one less bottle, so lets take one of the number of bottles
           $bottles = $bottles - 1;
           echo &quot;&lt;br /&gt;there will be $bottles green bottles sitting on a wall&quot;;
    }

  ?&gt;
  
  &lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
[/code]

Save that as greenbottles.php in the www folder, and type:

[code]127.0.0.1/greenbottles.php[/code]

into the address bar. Now thats interesting, the php has written the rhyme for us!

Now lets see how it works

[code]$bottles = 10;[/code]

Here we have created an [b]integer[/b], called [b]bottles[/b] with a value of [b]10[/b]. This represents the starting number of bottles. Try changing this value and see what happens.

[code]
  while ($bottles &gt; 0)
   {
   // inside
   }
[/code]

This is a [b]while statement[/b], it tells the browser that while the number of bottles is [b]bigger than[/b] 0, to do this code within the braces [b]{ }[/b]

[code]    echo &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot; . $bottles . &quot; green bottles sitting on a wall,&quot; .
            &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot; . $bottles . &quot; green bottles sitting on a wall,&quot; .
            &quot;&lt;br /&gt; if one green bottle should accidently fall,&quot;;[/code]

as you can see, echo can be carried over different lines, however a . is needed in order to link them. Also INTEGERS can be displayed using echo, and in between text by using the full stops

[code]$bottles = $bottles - 1;[/code]

Here, the number a bottles is changed to the number of bottles minus 1, basically taking one of the number of bottles.

If there is still more than 0 bottles the process is repeated, and thus the rhyme is displayed. However there is a gramatical error! When it reaches [b]one green bottles[/b] it does not remove the s! We can&#39;t have that ruining the image of this reknowned nursery rhyme! However have no fear, this can be fixed very easily, and a slightly more harder way. Since the harder way uses an [b]IF statement[/b] we will be going down that route :)

An if statement is used as shown below

[code]
if (statement)
 {
 //do this
 }
 else
 {
 //do this
 }
[/code]

if the statement returns true (for example 2&gt;1) it will execute the code inbetween the first pair of braces, if it returns false (for example 1&gt;2) it will execute the code in between the second pair of braces.

Lets put this into our page.

[code]
&lt;html&gt;
  
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Green bottles&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;?PHP
  $bottles = 10;
  
  while ($bottles &gt; 0)
    {

   if ($greenbottles &gt; 1)
      {
      echo &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot; . $bottles . &quot; green bottles sitting on a wall,&quot; .
              &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot; . $bottles . &quot; green bottles sitting on a wall,&quot; .
              &quot;&lt;br /&gt; if one green bottle should accidently fall,&quot;;
      //A BOTTLE HAS FALLEN!!! that means we have one less bottle, so lets take one of the number of bottles
      $bottles = $bottles - 1;
      echo &quot;&lt;br /&gt;there will be $bottles green bottles sitting on a wall&quot;;
      }
    else
      {
      echo &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot; . $bottles . &quot; green bottle sitting on a wall,&quot; .
              &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot; . $bottles . &quot; green bottle sitting on a wall,&quot; .
              &quot;&lt;br /&gt; if one green bottle should accidently fall,&quot;;
      //A BOTTLE HAS FALLEN!!! that means we have one less bottle, so lets take one of the number of bottles
      $bottles = $bottles - 1;
      echo &quot;&lt;br /&gt;there will be $bottles green bottles sitting on a wall&quot;;
      }
    }

  ?&gt;
  
  &lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
[/code]

Much better!

What have we learnt in this lesson?


[ul][*] How to use integers
[*] How to use while statements
[*] How to use if statements
[*] The green bottle nursery rhyme of by heart[/ul]


Thats all for now, but dont delete the pages you have created! We will be using the greenbottles.php when i introduce you to [b]forms[/b]. If you are impatient and are eager to learn more, type PHP tutorials into google and have fun :)

until next time,
