    <description>Hello,

As I didn&#39;t see anything like this in the section, I decided to make this guide. This guide will be designated towards an audience of people wanting to learn PHP. I will explain the fundamentals of this language, and I hope it&#39;s thorough enough for easy understanding. So, sit back, get your reading glasses on, and get ready! I give you a warm welcoming to:

[center][b][size=6][anchor=section1]1 - What is PHP?[/anchor][/size][/b][/center]

PHP is a recursive acronym for; &#39;Hypertext Preprocessor&#39;. It is an immensely popular open-source scripting language. It&#39;s designed to be especially beneficial to web development and it is able to be embedded into HTML. It can be extremely useful in the case of where making a specific webpage you&#39;d like, HTML does not have the capabilities to perform certain actions or processes. You can also use it to simplify your time, as opposed to writing hundreds of lines of HTML.

What makes PHP standout is that it&#39;s a server-based language. As opposed to JavaScript; which is client-sided. What this means is that the code you write is executed on the server, generating the HTML code which is then sent to the client for processing. The client, once received the results of your script, would not know what the underlying code was. You could even program your server to process all of your files with HTML, so your users couldn&#39;t exactly tell what you&#39;re really up to.

One of the best things with PHP is that you can jump right in! It&#39;s easy to understand, so don&#39;t be afraid of it. You&#39;ll come in, start learning, and within just a few hours, start writing some simple scripts.



[center][size=6][anchor=section11]1.1 - What will we be learning?[/anchor][/size][/center]

In this guide, you will be learning all the basic necessities in PHP. From variables, to functions, to classes, and all sorts of great utilities that will help you in the everyday usage of PHP! This guide is designed for the audience of newcomers in the language. If you&#39;re intermediate, above average, or just profound with this language, then I don&#39;t think you will find much of this information useful - as you have probably already learned it. PHP is a bold and dynamic language, so I envy you for giving it a shot! Hopefully, you&#39;ll end up being a widely successful web developer.



[center][size=6][anchor=section12]1.2 - What&#39;s an IDE?[/anchor][/size][/center]

IDE is an acronym for; &#39;integrated development environment&#39;. An IDE will help you a long ways in the development field! It will show where you have made a mistake, or what is being used and what&#39;s not. It will also compile your code and check it before you can! It&#39;s an amazing tool to use if you&#39;re a developer, and can make your projects that you construct much more at ease. They have unique tools such as syntax highlighters, code parsers, built-in compilation devices, and etc. If you&#39;re working on a large project and [i]aren&#39;t[/i] using an IDE, then I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing!



[center][size=6][anchor=section13]1.3 - Selecting an IDE[/anchor]
[/size][/center]
Selecting an IDE is as simple as pie! There are a few popular IDE&#39;s out there, and they are popular for a reason. They have a wide variety of tools, UI&#39;s, and plugins that make your coding experience just that much better. There are two &#39;most-popular&#39; IDE&#39;s available for free: [url=http://www.eclipse.org]Eclipse[/url], and [url=http://www.netbeans.org]NetBeans[/url].


[ul][*][url=http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-php-developers/lunasr2]You can find the Eclipse PHP IDE here![/url]
[*][url=https://netbeans.org/features/php/]You can find the NetBeans PHP IDE here![/url][/ul]

Go and check each one out, decide for your own, and download that one. They may be a little weird to use at first, as it&#39;s a strange environment to get used to, but once you get the hang of it - it&#39;s a cakewalk!



[center][size=6][anchor=section14]1.4 - When and when-not to use an IDE[/anchor][/size][/center]

IDE&#39;s are great and all, but there are times when you shouldn&#39;t use them. For example, IDE&#39;s typically have the capabilities of doing simple work for you. It may sound nice, yes; however, you should be concerned on what you&#39;ve actually learned. When learning the basics, I recommend to use a simple syntax highlighter, or [b]code editor[/b]. Code editors, such as [url=http://www.vim.org/download.php]Vim[/url] and [url=https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.7.9.html]Notepad++[/url], are great ways to still understand what exactly you&#39;re writing, and learn in the process. As they have syntax highlighters and code parsers typically build within them, you needn&#39;t worry about your code looking too ugly to work on.

In this tutorial, I recommend you use one of the code editors as previously stated in this section. Code editors are especially beneficial to the learning process.</description>

<p>As you’ll see in my post above, I didn’t specifically say “GO LEARN RUBY ITS MUCH BETTER LOL FK PHP”. I said that Ruby was mentioned a lot in this thread so lets take it from there. Besides that, Ruby when used in a web language can be put to use many different ways, it’s a very versatile language in that sense. The rule of thumb I used was Rails for anything large and Sinatra for any small work. Put simply, rails has a shit ton of things you’ll never use and sinatra is the very basics. I went with Ruby because it was simple and effective. No one is stating that Ruby is a web specific language.</p>

As far as I recall - nobody said Ruby was web specified. It should be commonplace to know otherwise. However, it could be a great doing in building a fairly significant website.</p>

<p>You can rely on PHP to be a pain in the backside, that’s about it. My main point isn’t to be bashing PHP, my main point is that you put your time and effort into learning other languages and furthering yourself as a website developer. Like I said, it’s a well written tutorial but it’s also a rewrite of PHP tutorials that can be found at the other end of a google search. There’s only so many ways that the basics can be written before they start to be come rewrites.</p>
<p>Instead of putting your time into perfecting tutorials like this, put it into reading up on other languages. I see you mention Ruby a lot, take a look at the likes of <a href="http://rubymonk.com" rel="nofollow noopener">rubymonk.com</a> which is a great interactive way to learn Ruby.</p>
<p>Contrary to my name I’m no Ruby expert, I’ve not written a single line of code in over a year in fact but I did have like 6 years worth of PHP under my belt so trust me when I say it’s not worth wasting your time with, I only have like a year or so experience with Ruby. It’s pretty easy to pick it up if you persevere with it. If you’re struggling, post in this board. We may seem like dickheads and that would be 100% accurate but if someone asks for help, we won’t turn them away.</p>

I don’t know the language very well.</p>

<p>No offence to whoever created this like you’ve put a lot of time and effort into it but the real question is why? The time you’ve spent doing this would be much better put into becoming comfortable with another language.</p>
<p>I spent most of my time on MoparScape preaching web development and design, I wrote something like 20 odd tutorials in this board based around PHP and preaching it to the masses. Trust me, it’s not worth it. It doesn’t get any better. People don’t think any higher of you and you don’t really help anyone out. Like I said, I’m not trying to be a dick, you’ve put a lot of effort into this but there are 101 tutorials like this a simple google search away.</p>
<p>You’d be much better putting your time and effort into something worth it like focusing on improving yourself as a programmer and broadening your horizons into a better, more well-designed language.</p>

<p>It seems like all of the main web languages have glaring issues, but maybe I’m just trying to compare them to what they (specifically PHP) are not: C++.

<p>They’ve made some advances on a few critical components such as using an AST for their parser, improving memory usage of their internal HashTable implementation (which is how PHP’s arrays are stored as, of course), removing deprecated database drivers, context-sensitive lexer, and generator functions. I’ve been keeping up with PHP 7 development for these reasons and I believe the goal they have been trying to accomplish was to get as close as HHVM as possible in terms of performance while also adding some extra syntactic goodies to the language.

See, that’s your problem. You shouldn’t be comparing the languages to C++ lol. They simply just aren’t. However, if I were to point someone in the direction of web development, I would honestly suggest Ruby over PHP. I need to start getting to learning that language more in-depth soon. I’m an amateur when it comes to it, and it seems like a very powerful languages. Albeit, it has it’s problems, but every language does.</p>
