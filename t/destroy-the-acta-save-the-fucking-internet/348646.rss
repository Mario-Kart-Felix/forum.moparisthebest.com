    <title>Destroy the ACTA! Save the fucking internet!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/destroy-the-acta-save-the-fucking-internet/348646</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know what forum or thread this should be in or even if it&#39;s ever posted but BAH. IT&#39;S -IMPORTANT. Fuck it if it&#39;s supposed to be in the news section!

[url=http://www.petitiononline.com/stopacta/petition.html]Petition&#39;s here.[/url]

The fuck is this. Google this shit, learn all you can. This is some seriously bad shit. If this passes it will definitely be no bueno. There is no way this is a good thing.

Copy pasted from Id-Boomer&#39;s journal here: [url=http://id-boomer.deviantart.com/journal/33468945/]http://id-boomer.deviantart.com/journal/33468945/[/url]

------------------

[i]So like some ACTA shit is going to stop piracy, WHICH ISN&#39;T A BAD DEAL BUT HERES THE CATCH.

THIS IS NOT ABOUT PIRACY.
THIS IS ABOUT PRIVACY.

Everyone on a computer will be monitored of their progress. No more privacy at all for anybody. NOPE.

- ISPS will now watch what you download, and tattle on you if you download a music track/ any data / rapidshares / torrents etc.
- ISPS will tattle on you, when you do anything which goes against &quot;Governments policy&quot;.
- ISPS will be able to document and store EVERYTHING you do online. nothing will ever be private again

Potential border searches are covered by the &quot;Border Measures&quot; proposal of ACTA. As of February 2009 and according to University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist there is significant disagreement among countries on this topic: &quot;Some countries are seeking the minimum rules, the removal of certain clauses, and a specific provision to put to rest fears of iPod searching customs officials by excluding personal baggage that contains goods of a non-commercial nature. The U.S. is pushing for broad provisions that cover import, export, and in-transit shipments.&quot;[42] Newspaper reported that the draft agreement would empower security officials at airports and other international borders to conduct random ex officio searches of laptops, MP3 players, and cellular phones for illegally downloaded or &quot;ripped&quot; music and movies. Travellers with infringing content would be subject to a fine and may have their devices confiscated or destroyed.[/i]


New link has been added with the following information:

&quot;Canadian officials travel to Guadalajara, Mexico this week to resume negotiations on the still-secret Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement. The discussion is likely to turn to the prospect of supporting three strikes and you’re out systems that could result in thousands of people losing access to the Internet based on three allegations of copyright infringement. Leaked ACTA documents indicate that encouraging the adoption of three-strikes - often euphemistically described as “graduated response” for the way Internet providers gradually send increasingly threatening warnings to subscribers - has been proposed for possible inclusion in the treaty.&quot;

Fucking niggers. I know you guys don&#39;t want that, right MITB? I know nobody is going to want this shit. This shit is serious.

They&#39;re going to monitor EVERYONE AND THEIR PRIVACY WILL BE GONE. And I don&#39;t want to log into my computer and see that someone is watching me.

This is basically what&#39;s controlling everything in the current world. Global corporations, and politics. They don&#39;t want you to be smart. They don&#39;t want you to think you can make a difference. Prove them wrong.

Tell as many people as you can. This needs as much attention as it can get! This is a SERIOUS CRISIS. They need to know we are here, and they need to know that we won&#39;t stand for it! People who are completely innocent can be subject to this. Even if you haven&#39;t downloaded a SINGLE file illegally EVER, they WILL target you. No one is safe.

And I&#39;m not stopping until people start joining in, this minimum amount is ridiculous.


Sign the petition! This isn&#39;t even about piracy anymore, it&#39;s about privacy!

              <p>People can say they wouldn’t buy the product they are illegally downloading, but that doesn’t change the vast amount of people who do nothing BUT download music illegally, who have not paid for music in years.</p>
<p>That argument is a good one to pull, but really, it doesn’t matter if it is for personal use and wasn’t going to buy it anyway. It matters that you are obtaining a product that you do not legally have any right to use. It does not matter at all the outcome or effects of you doing that, the one and only important fact remains - you do not have any right to take that product without paying for it.</p>
<p>These industries want to stop piracy for the knock on effect, letting slide will just lead to continued loss of custom. I know so many people who laugh at other people who not stealing their games or music, it is now a culture problem - people see no implications on their actions or encouragement of others., it goes beyond people taking it because they wouldn’t buy it anyway, it goes to people who would usually be a customer to someone who finds it easier just to pirate everything.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no justification at all for pirating any sort of media.</p>

I agree - but apparently you missed the part where it was an anti piracy bill. That’s not to say it should automatically happen, but its not like talking about piracy when talking about an anti-piracy bill is a bad idea.<br>

</aside>
<p>If anything, the music industry is probably doing better than ever - what with internet advertising (myspace, last.fm etc), and legal sources of music like iTunes. Free access to music has encouraged more people to be more interested in it, and to potentially buy legal music online or from a store. Before I found out how to download music for free I didn’t have a single CD, and I’m sure this is the case for other people too.</p>

<p>This is actually an important point. Loss estimations are oftentimes (if not always) grossly overestimated.<br>
And seriously, people thought cassette tape recordings were going to kill the radio and VHS was going to be the end of television.</p>
<p>As a person that isn’t poor but isn’t particularly wealthy either, I simply cannot condone a $20+ price tag for a music CD. As a deterrent to the music industry I will happily encourage others to exercise their right to fair use.</p>

              <p>Piracy laws have always seemed stupid to me because they always figure that if you didn’t <span class="bbcode-i">steal</span> it then you would have bought it.  Nothing could be further from the truth as we all know…I’m sure many of us (myself included) have downloaded simply because we see something cool…but in no way would we ever consider actually buying it.</p>

              <p>who the hell cares about piracy? i hear adverts saying “piracy is killing the music industry bla bla” would an artist turn down a career knowing they only get say, half the money they could be getting? 5 mil instead of 10? GTFO. artists wanna make money, and they will do.</p>
<p>I can safely say i have downloaded probably about 500 albums, and i would have paid for only 1 of them (which i actually did go out and buy, because i wanted the official copy, and it was cheap at the time)</p>
<p>i wouldn’t go fuckin buy a lady gaga single because i thought it was catchy and wanted to listen to it a few more times etc…</p>
