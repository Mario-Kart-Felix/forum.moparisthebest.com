    <description>Ok I downloaded and saved Ploxagescape and some other clients and its now on my desktop. My problem is they won&#39;t open and I dont know how to get em started. I&#39;ve download Winrar and now they look like 3 colors of books I extracted it and now a new folder come out saying Ploxagescape. I double click on it and its says ClientFiles then after that when i click on it says .jagex_catche_32 after that it says loginapplet or runescape or random or randomDeob503. After I click on all of em they lead me to a dead end and says computer cant open files or som crap and I need some help.
