    <title>My lottery command thingy</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-lottery-command-thingy/197305</link>
    <description>Ok so I have created a really simple lottery command.
All I wan&#39;t to do is improve it by making a message to all if the person wins or not.

Here is the command:

[code]if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;lottery&quot;)) {
if(actionTimer == 0)
if (playerHasItemAmount(995, 50000000)==true)
{
deleteItem(995, getItemSlot(995), 50000000);
sendMessage(&quot;You buy a lottery ticket&quot;);
addItem(Item2.randomlottery(), 1000000000);
sendMessage(&quot;Congradulations if you won!&quot;);
sendMessage(&quot;If not oh well you have 10 wait another 10 minutes before you buy another.&quot;);
sendMessage(&quot;Better luck next time.&quot;);
PlayerHandler.messageToAll = &quot;Do ::lottery for a chance to win the 1 bill !!&quot;;
actionTimer = 600;

}
else if ((playerHasItemAmount(995, 50000000)==false))
sendMessage(&quot;Lmfao you need 50m for a ticket....&quot;);
PlayerHandler.messageToAll = &quot;Lmfao someone just tried to cheat the Prodigyscape lottery!&quot;;
}[/code]

All I would like it so say is something like.
If they win it would say something like, &quot;Playername has won the Prodigyscape lottery of 1 billion coins!!!!&quot;
If they lose it would say something like, &quot;Playername has entered the lottery but lost, too bad.&quot;

How would I add this?
Srsly...

<p>Also, for the “Lmfao someone just tried to cheat the Prodigyscape lottery!”</p>
<p>change that to</p>
<p>PlayerHandler.messageToAll = “Lmfao “+playerName+” just tried to cheat on the Prodigyscape lottery”;</p>
