[B]Introduction;[/B]
It&#39;s been a while since Vitalize was online, we were previously a 317 but times were hard which led to the closure of the server unfortunately. The 614 has been in development for many weeks and I hope all problems are at a minimum so you guys can have a fun and enjoyable experience. If you&#39;re a previous Vitalize member and you have some sort of proof then I&#39;ll be more than happy to give you veteran rank. The new Vitalize is ALL - PvP, after some thought and consideration the idea of PvM has been scrapped due to it playing too low of a part in a master and spawn server. To replace this we&#39;ve included content that fits in perfectly with a PvP server; Mini-games such as Duel arena, Fight pits etc. If you&#39;re looking for a relaxed and friendly environment &amp; community to fight your friends in then this is the perfect server for you!

There aren&#39;t a lot of images you can show off with a PK server, CHECK IT OUT if you want a live demo;)[/CENTER]</description>
