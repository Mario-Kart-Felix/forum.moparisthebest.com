          <blockquote>
              <p>If you have a router, make it forward all connection attempts on the port your server is using to that port. So if the server uses port 43594, send all connections to your computer’s port 43594.</p>
<p>Then make sure your firewall doesn’t block TCP protocol connections on that port.<br>
Pretty simple.</p>
<p>Oh, and to find the IP you need to port forward to, press Windows key + r at the same time, and type ‘cmd’, without the quotation marks.</p>
<p>Then type ‘ipconfig’, without the quotation marks again. It will come up with IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway if you have a router. The number to the right of IP address is your computer’s IP address <em>on your network at home</em>. Port forward to that address, not your internet IP address.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a router, you just allow TCP connections through your firewall to the port your server uses and you should find it works.</p>
