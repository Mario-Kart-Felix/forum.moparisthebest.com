    <title>I Am Afraid To Play</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-am-afraid-to-play/402429</link>
    <description>If I leave my city and I try to raid. In order to raid I break a few blocks and proceed to steal a players stuff. But I end up getting reported, then banned shortly after. It as if the people on here circumvent their anger that builds up in them in real life and they attempt to take it out on others by getting them banned for doing such minimal amounts of damage. You all know who you are, so you can defend yourselves but you will not sway my opinion.

The rules should be revised and the punishments should be less harsh. Administrators should decide punishment length, not moderators. And by administrators, I mean Moparisthebest. A three day ban for destroying a cobblestone block is not only outrageous. Bans shouldn&#39;t be given out so often unless you really need to. Police officers don&#39;t go around shooting criminals every day, they only shoot if absolutely necessary. 

You really hurt others game play when you are so excessive with the bans. I am certain that breaking a few blocks wont ruin someones game play. However, banning someone for doing so absoloutley will. Where is the sense in this?</description>

Why should he quit whining, if he believes he has a unfair disadvantage he should tell us? We all know everyone treats him differently due to his gay brother.</p>

              <p>How about you just sneak in and steal things without breaking anything? It’s not as if it’s hard to circumvent a wall. And going out of your way to say people are just angry about RL is kinda of stupid of you, since it’s irrelevant. Anyway if you’re allowed to break things to get in it defies the point of an iron door rigged with a bomb as home defense, and other things. So I submit that you sir, get over it.</p>

              <p>Yes I agree with you, MineCraft certainly is a terrifying gaming experience. The ratings certainly don’t speak for the stark, ghastly reality of the game. The fear of running around the world, never knowing when a creeper will suddenly decide it has no need for that beautiful wooden structure you spent hours to build is unforgettable, especially by minors aged 6 to 13. My sister had a nervous breakdown because of the zombies, and she is now quite paranoid in real life, always expecting the apocalypse at every clock’s tick. She is now a strong supporter of <a href="http://www.zombiewarning.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Zombie Warning</a> and has led many protests against the lack of a zombie warning system over the entire world.</p>
