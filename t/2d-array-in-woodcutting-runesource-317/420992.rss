    <title>2D Array in Woodcutting. RuneSource 317</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2d-array-in-woodcutting-runesource-317/420992</link>
    <description>Firstly, I don&#39;t want to use enums at this very moment, in case anyone brings it up.

I&#39;m trying to use a 2D array to iterate through the axe item ID and axe animation ID.
[code=java]
private static final int AxeAnim[][] = {{1351,879}, {1349,877}, {1353,875}, {1361,873}, {1355,871}, {1357,869}, {1359,867}, {6739,2846}};
[/code]

I&#39;m not too sure how to use it because when I attempt to cut a tree it doesn&#39;t recognise that I have an axe.

Loop through and check the corresponding axe to it&#39;s animation
[code=java]
public static void checkAxe(Player player) {
		Item weapon = player.getEquipment().getItemContainer().get(3);

			for (int i = AxeAnim.length; i &lt; 8; i++) {
				for (int j = AxeAnim.length; j &lt; 8; j++) {

		if (player.getInventory().getItemContainer().contains(AxeAnim[i][j]) || weapon == new Item(AxeAnim[i][j])) {
			CuttingAnim = AxeAnim[i][j];
				}
			}
		}
	}
[/code]

Where am I going wrong?</description>

<p>This is exactly what I was trying to do, so thanks for your time. Much appreciated.</p>

Using .equals() might work depending on the implementation of the Item class on your server, but the easiest way would be just checking if the weapon's itemId is equal (that is, ==) to the item ID found in the array.

To make it work both ways you should change the comparison as I described above].</blockquote>
<p>Okay, I’ll do this and all. Thanks again.</p>

              <p>First, your for loops start after the end of the array. They should start at the beginning, at index zero, and go until the end of the array. The correct way to do this is to loop from 0 to arrayName.length.</p>
<p>Your inner for loop is incorrect and unnecessary: The item ID of the axe would be <code>AxeAnim[i][0]</code> and the corresponding animation would be <code>AxeAnim[i][1]</code></p>
<p>Try this out:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public static void checkAxe(Player player) {
	Item weapon = player.getEquipment().getItemContainer().get(3);

	for (int i = 0; i &lt; AxeAnim.length; i++) {
