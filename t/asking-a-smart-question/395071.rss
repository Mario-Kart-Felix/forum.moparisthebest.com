Anyone else think that this should be a requirement for any online community, and life in general?</description>

I remember the quiz, and it didn’t really do much to solve the problem of asking questions. As for requiring users to ask intelligent questions… it isn’t going to happen. If you make it a rule, no one is going to pay enough attention, and you’d end up having to moderate most questions people ask.<br>

I think we should have a system for if people render a question stupid or pointless you can report it and when it gets to a level of reports the asker gets like a 8 hour mute and every time they try to post it says to work on making more productive post. Probably wouldn’t work with players though so maybe the mods should do it to people they think deserve it.[/quote]</p>
<p>People would abuse a system like that.<br>
And yeah, i remember the quiz, And its sad that it has been removed, but i actually think the quiz should be a set of random questions that require some googleing/searching as that is what this community is useless at.</p>

              <p>Although, I’m not sure if a quiz would be the best solution. A long time ago, MITB once said that he wanted this community to be a place where people can learn programming (mainly in Java), by way of developing RuneScape emulators.</p>
<p>English should be the primary language spoken on the forums, and if your primary language isn’t English, let the people viewing your topic know this ahead of time. Grammar and spelling should be as close to proper as possible in that case. For example, idioms don’t translate well between languages.</p>
<p>But people should seriously exhaust all their resources before asking a question. If they’re not willing to do that, and essentially demand someone fix a problem for them when they’ve done nothing themselves just makes people more likely to ignore them.</p>
