    <title>Annoying fishing problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/annoying-fishing-problem/413373</link>
    <description>Hi, my server is a 317 Delta. (Don&#39;t hate on Delta. :P)

I have a little problem with fishing.. whenever a player attempts to use a small fishing net, harpoon or lobster cage he/she will be disconnected. But just clicking on the spots causes no disruption in the server. 

My question is, how do I stop them from disconnecting when the use their fishing items on the fishing spots? 

Thank you, Godspeed and party on.</description>
