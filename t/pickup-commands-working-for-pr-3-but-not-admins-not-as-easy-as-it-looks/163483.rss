    <title>Pickup commands working for pR =3 but not admins?(not as easy as it looks)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pickup-commands-working-for-pr-3-but-not-admins-not-as-easy-as-it-looks/163483</link>
    <description>someone please help me... i want it so that mods, admins, and owners can spawn items using the ::pickup command... but my pickup command makes it so that only owners can spawn items... can someone please help?

look at this coding please
[code]if (command.startsWith(&quot;pickup&quot;) &amp;&amp; (playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Liam&quot;) || playerRights &gt;= 1)) {
	try {
		int newItemID = Integer.parseInt(command.substring(8,11));
		int newItemAmount = Integer.parseInt(command.substring(12));
		if (newItemID &lt;= 20000 &amp;&amp; newItemID &gt;= 0) {
			addItem(newItemID, newItemAmount);
		} else {
			sendMessage(&quot;No such item.&quot;);
		}
	} catch(Exception e) {
		sendMessage(&quot;Wrong Syntax! Use as ::pickup 0995 10&quot;);
	}
}
[/code]

this is in my client.java, and i have compiled already, but it still wont let admins and mods spawn... and they (i tested and a few others did too) still can&#39;t spawn if they are an admin or mod, but owners still can spawn...</description>
