I dont think all Muslims are out to kill Americans.</p>
<p>Imagine you’re studying on American history. Think of how it sounds.</p>
<p>9/11 2001 Committed by an extremist group that happened to be Muslim</p>
<p>2011 Muslim Mosque built on ground zero</p>
<p>“Sounds like a victory”.</p>
<p>There is nothing really wrong with it, but its irony will draw way to much attention from Americans. I wouldn’t be surprised if it was burned (already mentioned)</p>
<p>Also jme was right. This thread was made it straightforward that it was being built on ground zero soil, which is much more of an issue than building it near it.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/anthony">@Anthony</a> There are Muslims who disagree with the building to. One was interviewed today actually, but i havent slept and i dont remember her first name. It was along side an argument of the ban in France and (soon) the US from Muslims wearing body covering clothes because it can be used to conceal weapons etc. If Saddam didn’t use all the income from oil sales to build his military instead of helping his country then it wouldn’t be so unstable. It makes/lets people do stuff that leads to bans like this. -Argument i spent months with Radeon on, don’t really have the time to go over it again.</p>
<p>Basically it doesn’t bother me so much that its near it. But it would be in better regards to the owners of the mosque and the residents to not build it there.</p>

<p>Why though? Why should they give into a stereotype that is completely wrong? Asking for it to be moved is them accepting blame for something that has absolutely nothing to do with them.</p>

<p>Religion is bullshit. In essence, it is what starts many wars and acts of terrorism. The basis of the terrorist are Radical Islam and believe that if they blow shit up along with them, they get virgins in heaven. The Holocaust? That started because Hitler decided to get rid of the Jews.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure there are a shitload more of events like these, and what do they all have in common? Religious differences.</p>

<p>we arent against the muslims, were against the fact that terrorists, who happen to be muslim people flew planes into 2 of the largest buildings in new york, and it doesnt seem right to have a church belonging to that religion in the same area… it could be anywhere else, but it has to be next to ground zero?</p>
