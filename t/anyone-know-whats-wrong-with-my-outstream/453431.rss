    <title>Anyone know whats wrong with my outstream?</title>

    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;if (!nonWild())
		{
			outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
			outStream.writeByteC(3);
			outStream.writeByteA(0);
			outStream.writeString(&quot;null&quot;);
			outStream.endFrameVarSize();
		}
		else
		{
			outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
			outStream.writeByteC(3);
			outStream.writeByteA(1);
			outStream.writeString(&quot;@dre@Attack&quot;);
			outStream.endFrameVarSize();
		}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Problem: The option to attack players is visible no matter where you stand, wild or non wild.
Solution attempts: I&#39;ve tried switching the code around, trying other codes, even trying to make my own code by making a IsInWilderness = true/false; statement.. nothing seems to work!

Can anyone help out with whats going on? It seems to ignore the else statement, I&#39;ve tried else if statements.. I&#39;ve done all kinds of things. No luck.</description>
