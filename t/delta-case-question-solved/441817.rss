    <title>[Delta] Case question [solved]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-case-question-solved/441817</link>
    <description>This really isn&#39;t worth a topic but I need to know it.

So I know there is a case for just about everything. I need to know what case number is for clicking objects(if any). If there is none. I need to know what method etc. is used for clicking objects. This is for a handler I&#39;m making.</description>

<p>No not really… I’ll give you an example. Hopefully it makes sense.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">		case 122:

<p>That’s my case 122. That deals with most things with items in the invo.</p>

<p>That is a packet.<br>
Delta packets are stored under a switch which are the cases,<br>
every packet id handles another ingame action which is called from what you click in your client.<br>
which are these things: inStream.readSignedWordBigEndianA();<br>
you should read up about the 317 protocol on the rswiki</p>
<p>btw, 122 is not buring bones only, its the useItem packet which handles the “useItem” option on items in your inventory.<br>
note: this can also be another option, its the first one of the drop down menu on your item, thats why it also can be “bury” and “drink”<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Tbh I never knew about the rsps wiki and all that. thanks for the tip.<br>
Should have known it was 132… EVERYTHING happens in 132 lol.<br>
[Solved.]</p>
<p>RandQm mind clearing some space in your pm box or something. It seems your really the only one that has any relevant help to delta for me :)[/quote]</p>
