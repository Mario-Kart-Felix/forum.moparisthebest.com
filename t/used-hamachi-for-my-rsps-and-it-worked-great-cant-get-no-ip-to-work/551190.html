<ol>
<li>Don’t do anything with utorrent. If it’s using port 43594, change it.</li>
<li>Assign yourself a static IP on your router.</li>
<li>Restart your router, and possibly computer.</li>
<li>Check if your port is open.</li>

        <p>uTorrent works for portforwarding by making an exception in the windows firewall, and it typically uses uPnP. Some routers will have uPnP disabled, so if using uTorrent, you need to make sure that it’s not.</p>
<p>Another issue with uTorrent is, it likes to bind to the port you specify… So running it on port 43594 will bind it to 43594, therefore making it impossible for your RSPS to… The solution to that is to set uTorrent to a port that’s not 43594, run the rsps, and after it’s done and loaded to set the port back to 43594.</p>
<p>However, I’d rather not use uTorrent if I didn’t have to. If you portforwarded in the router already, then I’d close out of uTorrent completely. No-IP is only needed if your IP address (Not your local one, your broadcast IP) is dynamic. Most ISPs these days make them static, so you don’t “need” No-IP, but people still use it. Also make sure your router allows anonymous connections (I’ve heard this being the issue on some routers).</p>
<p>To check that your port forwarded, make sure your server is fully running, and then head over to <a href="http://canyouseeme.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://canyouseeme.org</a> and enter 43594, then run the test.</p>

If canyouseeme comes back that its working, then other people can connect to you(assuming your server is running), only you cannot.<br>
Reason is NAT redirection which does not allow intermingling between network nodes through an external network source, without your permission.</p>
<p>EX:<code>
Client:192.168.1.10
Server: 192.168.1.15
Router: 192.168.1.1
Client --&gt; connect: 192.168.1.15 --&gt; success!
Client --&gt; connect: your_no_ip --&gt; failed!
[192.168.1.10 --&gt;router(192.168.1.1)--&gt;isp--&gt;no_ip_redirection_service--&gt;isp--&gt;router(192.168.1.1)--&gt;ERR]</code> The router saying no because the start and end node are both in your local network. Your ideal way to connect is through the direct ip (192.168.1.15).</p>
<p>How is this a security threat?<br>
Data integrity is vulnerable, prone to spying/alterations.<br>
[client -&gt; router -&gt; OUTSIDE_YOUR_NETWORK -&gt; router -&gt; Server]<br>
Gives a chance for anyone to read/tamper with the data.</p>
<p>Some router’s give you the ability to disable this feature, which is a mistake IMO.</p>
<p>If you think it is not a big deal, consider the fact that it is your server. Try and think of a reason someone would want the username/password of the owner.</p>
<p>sk8r this is not an conflict of your post, just extending what you started.</p>
