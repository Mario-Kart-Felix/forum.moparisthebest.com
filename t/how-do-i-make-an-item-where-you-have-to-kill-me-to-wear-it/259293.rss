<p>Thanks for calling me a nub &gt;.&lt;</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be somthing like</p>
<p>You need to kill +playername+ in order to weild this item…<br>
If (User) has killed +playername+ equipt item (id)<br>
case (action)</p>
<p>Im not too sure but I think that is what you would have to do… If you search for like what you need to weild a firecape and it says jad then change that arround to suit the player that people need to kill to weild the item.</p>
