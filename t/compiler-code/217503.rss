    <description>[b]Thank you for choosing one of Fury&#39;s Codes.[/b]

Here is a compiler code. It works excellently.

[code]@echo off
COLOR 04
title Fury Compiler
echo -------------------------
echo Files Being Compiled...
echo -------------------------
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_06\bin\javac.exe&quot; -cp . *.java
pause

This isnt a compiler, its a batch file, so please stop calling it a “compiler”. I never understood why all of you people want batch files for COMPILING, yes running is one thing, we expect the knowledge of USERS to be low… but what on earth are you call coding in? Notepad? And why arent you using ant, as stated the “rsc” servers use ant, because ant is fan dabby dozy etc. I would IMAGINE most of you guys are coding in a full fledged ide (and given the fact that you need batch files, if you arent, you probably should be)… and if you are not its probably because you are using some powerful editor with powerful features but not incredibly user friendly (emacs, vi etc) and should be more than happy within a console.</p>
<p>Even alot of the most basic “java development environments” will have some level of ant / build support, and if it dosent, suck it up and use a command line, the command line is your friend and can be very useful…</p>
<p>So the only conclusion I can draw is if you use these batch files (which only work on single level heirachies - ever heard of packages?) is that you are coding in notepad, and I dont care who you are, there is no reason you should be.</p>
<p>People compiling files should be “developers” and they should not be using batch files to compile. Shape it up people.<br>

<p>This is a compiler, due to the fact it compiles .java files into .class files.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Sean, post:15, topic:217503”]Yeah I do, I wasnt trying to have a jab at you at all. It just seems that using batchfiles or even condoing their use seems rather strange. They are a horrible solution to a <em>DEVELOPER</em> problem. The way I see it is I expect developers to have a certain level of competance, and if they need to rely on batch files so that they can use windows explorer to compile their applications theres an issue.</p>
<p>For running things its perfectly acceptible to use batch files (well primarily for the public or finished projects). I just dont see why any developer should require a batch file to compile his own code, but I guess its the moparscape gap, people trying to be developers with the knowledge of users. Nothing wrong with that, but they have to learn, and they do tend to learn by following the coat tails of others in the field.</p>
<p>I personally feel that most open source projects are open armed when ant comes in, its the defacto general build system for java atm. Yes there are alot of other avenues you can go into (continuis intergration systems blah blah blah).</p>
<p>ephemeral you seem to know what you are talking about, so dont take any of my post as a slight against you. I just feel that these batch files should not be required by developers, and if a developer needs a batch file, he should surely be able to craft it himself, and not have to come here to look for a user friendly colour changing batch script. If they have to, theres a big problem.[/quote]well, developers dont do that. just moparscapers come looking because they dont even know what the hell a directory is or where to find out if they even have java installed, let alone begin to understand what java is. developers can make their own batch files, but moparscapers rely on others to do everything for them, which is pathetic.</p>

              <p>Yeah I do, I wasnt trying to have a jab at you at all. It just seems that using batchfiles or even condoing their use seems rather strange. They are a horrible solution to a <em>DEVELOPER</em> problem. The way I see it is I expect developers to have a certain level of competance, and if they need to rely on batch files so that they can use windows explorer to compile their applications theres an issue.</p>
<p>For running things its perfectly acceptible to use batch files (well primarily for the public or finished projects). I just dont see why any developer should require a batch file to compile his own code, but I guess its the moparscape gap, people trying to be developers with the knowledge of users. Nothing wrong with that, but they have to learn, and they do tend to learn by following the coat tails of others in the field.</p>
<p>I personally feel that most open source projects are open armed when ant comes in, its the defacto general build system for java atm. Yes there are alot of other avenues you can go into (continuis intergration systems blah blah blah).</p>
<p>ephemeral you seem to know what you are talking about, so dont take any of my post as a slight against you. I just feel that these batch files should not be required by developers, and if a developer needs a batch file, he should surely be able to craft it himself, and not have to come here to look for a user friendly colour changing batch script. If they have to, theres a big problem.</p>

              <p>Yes, that is totally correct. Batch-files are very inflexible, and needs alot of maintenance. I do use Apache Ant aswell, but I have seen that alot of people (when it comes to open-source) does not (just take a look around on this site, for instance), which causes them to complain about the program not working, so I usually put one set of batch-files for Windows-users, and one for Linux-users in subdirectories to the bin-folder in the project. This atleast eliminates the most complaints, but as with everything, not all.</p>
<p>Also, I never mentioned anything about packages in my previous post, and I use them deliberately when needed (which is for the most part in my projects).</p>
<p>When it comes to running projects, I would say that Java Web-Start would be the better choise (perhaps not always, but you get my point?), instead of batch-files.</p>

              <p>I honestly cannot see why compiling with batch-files are bad? I would say, as long as you know what you are doing, it would be just as fine as any other alternative.</p>
<p>On companies, however, they usually do keep certain standards, where they might be forced to use certain programs, because they are members of certain groups etc. that give them lower price on their programs (whether they are IDE:s or other tools).</p>
<p>Personally, when at work I have to use the IDE they use, because of the above stated reason. But when I am at home, I prefer not to. In my own opinion, I think the most (which is all I have ever tried) IDE:s requires too much resources (as in, they take a while before they respond when doing different actions etc. (which looks like if they lag)) on my computer for me to feel comfortable with it (and they put alot of 3:rd-party files to my directories, that makes everything look more crappy). Instead I use a home-made Java-editor to write my files. Sure, it doesn’t have all the nifty features as the most IDE:s, but it is enough for me. If I ever need to refactor, I load everything into an IDE, and do it fast etc.</p>
<p>I guess, it is all about your own taste, and should stay that way. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>And yes, I agree, Apache Ant is a very good thing to use… It makes everything so easy to manage.</p>

              <p>This isnt a compiler, its a batch file, so please stop calling it a “compiler”. I never understood why all of you people want batch files for COMPILING, yes running is one thing, we expect the knowledge of USERS to be low… but what on earth are you call coding in? Notepad? And why arent you using ant, as stated the “rsc” servers use ant, because ant is fan dabby dozy etc. I would IMAGINE most of you guys are coding in a full fledged ide (and given the fact that you need batch files, if you arent, you probably should be)… and if you are not its probably because you are using some powerful editor with powerful features but not incredibly user friendly (emacs, vi etc) and should be more than happy within a console.</p>
<p>Even alot of the most basic “java development environments” will have some level of ant / build support, and if it dosent, suck it up and use a command line, the command line is your friend and can be very useful…</p>
<p>So the only conclusion I can draw is if you use these batch files (which only work on single level heirachies - ever heard of packages?) is that you are coding in notepad, and I dont care who you are, there is no reason you should be.</p>
<p>People compiling files should be “developers” and they should not be using batch files to compile. Shape it up people.</p>
