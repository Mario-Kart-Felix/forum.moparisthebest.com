I haven’t no, I had the virtuous quattro for a while, but I think that’s been discontinued as it hadn’t been updated for around 2 months, but I’ve heard good things <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Have you looked at the Evo 3D?  Here in UK it’s going for around £200 unlocked at Asda, which is fantastic considering it started at £500, has same specs as the Sensation, only it has 256mb more RAM, and a slightly lower megapixel camera.  It’s a good phone, I think it just didn’t sell too well due to the 3D being a bit gimmicky.</p>

droid 4 is coming out soon, basically a droid razr with a physical keyboard - rumor is feb 9 release, here’s a review <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/motorola-droid-4-impressions-finally-a-4g-lte-phone-with-a-decent-keyboard/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/motorola-droid-4-impressions-finally-a-4g-lte-phone-with-a-decent-keyboard/</a><br>

I’ve seen the razr in person, and I wouldn’t remotely want that either, the screen is so friggin big it wouldn’t even fit in my pocket, damn…[/quote]<br>
I’ve not seen it in person, but I know the feeling. The first time I held an epic 4g touch, I was shocked. I’m so used to my optimus’s 3.2’’ screen <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I don’t know if I’ve said it before, but I think Motorola might be dropping something new for sprint sometime soon. Our in-store price for the photon dropped from $199 to $99 a week or two ago, and the XPRT dropped from $99 to $29.</p>

<p>I can pick up a Droid 3 from ebay for about 335 usd including shipping to Sweden, which is a pretty damn low price (borked ESN, aka won’t work on US providers, but fine on others). I probably will within the next 2-3 months or so, as i really want a physical keyboard over the turd that is touch-keyboard.</p>

              <p>idk how to use swype. tried and it doesnt work handed the phone to someone else like seconds after i tried and it worked for them. I used to have to need a physical keyboard but having a large 4.5" screen and swiftkey x everything is fine. has 2 different styles precise and rapid. it also learns how you write so it will get faster the more you use it. you can type 160 chars in lets say 20-30 taps on the screen.</p>
