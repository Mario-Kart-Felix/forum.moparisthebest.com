    <title>Rscb new server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rscb-new-server/310125</link>
    <description>Hey,

Rscb is a new server ive just made, im open to any suggestions and if successful i will add them. At the moment im still adding a couple of things, but ive put online for people to see what they think of it and if they think things should be added/removed 

Ive decided not go with what everyone else does, so ive added Roa into the end of taverly dungeon there is a lever you can pull in edge to get there without having to walk through whole dungeon.

This is Slime, once again decided not to go for the normal npcs and the usual locations, you can teleport to him by adventurer.

I will add more when i get to it but i thought rather than adding what i thought was good idd add a few things and see what the players want, after all they will be the ones playing so please check out the server if you like and add azza in game if you wish to give me any suggestions what you what like adding or post them on the website.

exp rate : 40x atm, changing in 12 hours to 25x
