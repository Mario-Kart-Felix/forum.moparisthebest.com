    <title>In need of a hoster. [please read]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/in-need-of-a-hoster-please-read/123965</link>
    <description>Hello, as you all can see, I&#39;m in need of a hoster for my server.  I&#39;m only about half way through it, but I tested it today, and I got a couple people on it before I crashed myself.  I really don&#39;t want my players being irritated, then leaving, so I&#39;ve come to find a trustworthy hoster.  

The name of my server is [b]Alcatraz[/b](please tell me if you&#39;ve seen the name elsewhere), which is a jail based theme, which no one has ever used before.  At least this &quot;jail&quot; I&#39;ve never seen before on a server&#39;s base.

I can really compromise with people well, too.  See, I&#39;m only looking for around [b][i]10-12/5-7[/i][/b], so this should not be hard to find.  I will get back to you with the exact size of my server. The hoster will be Administrator/Co-Owner on my(our) server &amp;&amp; forums, which is a great reward. 

If you would like to help me out hosting around [b]10-12/5-7[/b], please contact me on my msn at J.Brantz@hotmail.com .  Please allow me time to get back to you and be patient, for I have am not on MSN at all times.  I assure you I&#39;ll get back in touch with you, though.

                                                                              Thanks in advance. 



[i][ == Note == ][/i]  [b]Don&#39;t even try to lie to just get after my source, I can sense when people are trustworthy from those who aren&#39;t.[/b]</description>
