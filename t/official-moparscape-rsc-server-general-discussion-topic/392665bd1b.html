<p>Neither servers will be administered. Kryptix &amp; his mod’s are very bad at supporting it’s players on RSCE why would it change with a different server? I know of a lot of things that went on behind the scenes of RSCE and I honestly can’t be bothered to try RSCDaemon out just because I know the same shit will go on. I most likely will register and attempt to play MoparClassic if it ever comes out, but nothing will happen there. It’s been almost a year since the idea of it was introduced and still nothing. I doubt any of the admin’s or mods will be online to help any players, they all have a bad record of starting something and stopping when shit gets too rough. Can everyone just face the fact that RSC is gone, in all aspects. RSCAngel was the best private server out there and due to skiddies, it’s gone.</p>

<p>Neither servers will be administered. Kryptix &amp; his mod’s are very bad at supporting it’s players on RSCE why would it change with a different server? I know of a lot of things that went on behind the scenes of RSCE and I honestly can’t be bothered to try RSCDaemon out just because I know the same shit will go on. I most likely will register and attempt to play MoparClassic if it ever comes out, but nothing will happen there. It’s been almost a year since the idea of it was introduced and still nothing. I doubt any of the admin’s or mods will be online to help any players, they all have a bad record of starting something and stopping when shit gets too rough. Can everyone just face the fact that RSC is gone, in all aspects. RSCAngel was the best private server out there and due to skiddies, it’s gone.<br>
[/quote]What do mods actually need to do?[/quote]<br>
Well seeing as they want to attract a new community to play this game they will obviously be new, they would have to show a lot of people around and help with various questions they might have. Name 1 mod that is listed in the MoparClassic staff that will actually willing help with that before I even list what else mods should do.</p>

</aside>
<p>The way I’m designing the new system it will make power abuse from moderators impossible. Don’t just think a ‘new server’ means what it usually means (someone using an old source code with a bit of new content and new staff), the whole system is being reworked as it was flawed since Reines’ RSCD. No one will have power in-game, it’s not needed and moderators don’t need any power souch as teleporting, alerting players, summoning (etc) as manual bot checks are no more. The only thing moderators will do is reply to support/appeal/report tickets and being able to ban/mute players directly from a ticket. The player will need to be reported multiple times before a moderator has any power in punishing a player. Zilent and I will be the only administrators and we have nothing but the best intentions for the game and any kind of abuse would be stupidity. We want a fresh slate and have said time and time again no grudges or bad feelings will be passed over to RSCDaemon.</p>
<p>Your comment stems from me not manually resetting your password for you the other day. We both know that full well and personally I see that as good administration because I’m sticking to my word and not being bias. A year ago I posted that I would no longer be manually resetting passwords or recovering accounts and the <span class="bbcode-b">only</span> way to recover an account is via your recovery questions. The reasons behind this are simple, you’ve been hacked before and all your details were made public, what’s stopping that from happening again and your account being stolen from them providing your e-mails, IP’s, names, etc. You’re quite computer literate so imagine how many other players this has also happened to. I don’t have the patience or desire to manually verify every single person that forgets their password which is why I’d sooner draw the line completely. I can’t keep up with all the drama in the scene and nor do I want to. I have seen hundreds (if not thousands) of players having their accounts compromised because someone guessed their e-mail secret question and recovered their account(s) via e-mail which is why that system was removed completely.</p>
<p>As I’ve said many times, the community is just full of people that hold grudges and dislike you if you don’t do everything they want you to do. It’s very hard to remain liked when you have to tell people ‘NO’ which is why RSCDaemon’s system should help towards that from the very start. Everything (and I mean everything) will be handled via tickets in a fair and organised way with no bias decisions and actions only taken when crystal clear evidence is available. I can’t see why anyone would disagree with a system handled like this.</p>

[22:08]  Help me out for a minute please.. It's really not my fault. My old account, same IP as me, etc, I didn't paly when recoveries were put into place , i didnt' play from then till last week and I don't know the pw to one of my accounts
00[22:08]  not happening
[22:08]  -.-
[22:08]  Kinda shitty tbh
00[22:08]  i have no way of changing passwords
00[22:09]  never made a system for it
[22:09]  emails?
[22:09]  i know the email on the account..
[22:09]  but i don't own it anymore, as you recall mine was hacked by that one kid who posted all my info on forums
00[22:09]  that doesn't change anything, i have no way of changing passwords
[22:09]  you could change the email and i could recover it from there?
00[22:10]  you can't recover via e-mail
00[22:10]  recovery only
[22:10]  Wtf -.-
00[22:10]  because people were hacking e-mails
[22:11]  That's a ridiculous system tbh, for anyone except Mods or people who just started playing within the past few months.
00[22:11]  okay
00[22:11]  a much better system is to allow people to recover via e-mail, and people get hacked on RSCE and causes them to quit because they've been phish'd with a fake msn logging in shit

</aside>
<p>And I’ve said numerous times that I’ve made mistakes during RSCEmulation which is why we’re starting fresh to demonstrate this. If you don’t want to give up a grudge and give it a go then so be it, I can’t twist your arm into playing but I’m more than confident that most people will give it a go.</p>
<p>I agree RSCEmulation was corrupt, it makes me sick thinking that after all the hard work that has been put into the project it’s still possible for staff to abuse their powers but without completely redoing how the game is managed it’s not an easy task to overcome. People don’t like change which is why a fresh start is needed. I’ve wanted to remove the Master Fisher for literally years but since it was there from day one (not my choice) people can’t handle the change of it being removed.</p>
<p>You lot might all think these kind of problems only occur on RSCEmulation but that’s rubbish, Zilent and I have to proxy every time we visit Mopar because if we don’t our IP’s are given to whoever and we start to undergo attacks. If that can happen then why can’t players IP’s be released too? I’m not saying this is unique to Mopar either, it’s been happening for years on RSC private servers and we’ve taken this all on board. This is exactly why we’re going through such a radical change because we want the fairest possible game play for the players. There’s no point in making these changes to RSCEmulation because enough people have already gained an advantage.</p>

I agree but that’s what I’m trying to change. At the end of the day anyone you meet online is ultimately a stranger, I’ve trusted multiple people and been fucked over more times than I can count so the only way to resolve things is to remove the power from them whilst still allowing them to help. There’s no need for in-game moderators, there’s no reason for most of the debates which lead to immaturity because those situations won’t occur.</p>
<p>In response to the deletions, I admit I have deleted accounts in the past due to what they’ve posted on other forums but there’s generally always a reason behind this. As I’m sure you’re more than aware, a large percentage of players playing RSC private servers will use automation software if they can and pretty much every single person that gets caught will deny they were doing anything wrong because they know it’s very difficult to prove. What people didn’t know is that on most RuneScape related forums I had contacts that would happily reveal their IP addresses so I could issue mass-bans, these forums included Wartnet, Mopar, RuneLocus, Sythe, Rahbot, etc. If someone was actively going out of their way to discourage others from playing or were admitting to using bots (or doing anything else that broke RSCEmulation’s rules) I did at time simply just mass-delete all associated accounts as they were not the type of players I wanted. I realise now that yes it probably was immature and yes it probably wasn’t the best move to make but ultimately when people are saying your game is swarmed with bots it was the logical choice at the time when every IP on Rahbot was released to me. People used to make anonymous accounts on Mopar and literally shit-talk RSCEmulation into the grown whilst playing it all day. They felt fearless behind their anonymity which is why it was quite pleasurable to delete them only for them to come crying a few minutes later.</p>
<p>With all servers that followed Reines’ RSCD everyone kind of took his concept (which was wrong in many ways) and continued with it as that was the obvious choice back in the day. When RSCEmulation was started we too went along with the same structure (in-game moderators, the ability to abuse power, etc).

Starting a new server isn’t going to just refresh your name and make everyone automatically trust you.<br>
The only reason I will probably not play RSCD is because the lagg of English speaking mods, the lack of maturity mods have, and just the simple fact if you do 1 thing wrong outside the game, IE on Mopar forums, there goes your account.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I agree but that’s what I’m trying to change. At the end of the day anyone you meet online is ultimately a stranger, I’ve trusted multiple people and been fucked over more times than I can count so the only way to resolve things is to remove the power from them whilst still allowing them to help. There’s no need for in-game moderators, there’s no reason for most of the debates which lead to immaturity because those situations won’t occur.</p>
<p>In response to the deletions, I admit I have deleted accounts in the past due to what they’ve posted on other forums but there’s generally always a reason behind this. As I’m sure you’re more than aware, a large percentage of players playing RSC private servers will use automation software if they can and pretty much every single person that gets caught will deny they were doing anything wrong because they know it’s very difficult to prove. What people didn’t know is that on most RuneScape related forums I had contacts that would happily reveal their IP addresses so I could issue mass-bans, these forums included Wartnet, Mopar, google, Sythe, Rahbot, etc. If someone was actively going out of their way to discourage others from playing or were admitting to using bots (or doing anything else that broke RSCEmulation’s rules) I did at time simply just mass-delete all associated accounts as they were not the type of players I wanted. I realise now that yes it probably was immature and yes it probably wasn’t the best move to make but ultimately when people are saying your game is swarmed with bots it was the logical choice at the time when every IP on Rahbot was released to me. People used to make anonymous accounts on Mopar and literally shit-talk RSCEmulation into the grown whilst playing it all day. They felt fearless behind their anonymity which is why it was quite pleasurable to delete them only for them to come crying a few minutes later.</p>
<p>With all servers that followed Reines’ RSCD everyone kind of took his concept (which was wrong in many ways) and continued with it as that was the obvious choice back in the day. When RSCEmulation was started we too went along with the same structure (in-game moderators, the ability to abuse power, etc). We implemented tons of logging to reduce this heavily but that doesn’t stop the damage before it happens. With the new system it will be impossible to abuse powers. No one will have any access to do anything malicious except me and I’m trying to be as transparent as possible to demonstrate that yes I have made mistakes but I see RSCEmulation as a practise run.</p>
<p>With the way the new structure is going to be, accounts will be much harder to obtain (invitation only) so people won’t be quite as fearless. With the high XP rates of RSCEmulation, selection of available bots combined with how easy it is to register (you don’t even require an e-mail address or any validation what-so-ever) it made players simply not care about getting banned and in turn could be as disrespectful, anonymous and childish as they pleased.

<p>I agree it’s not the most ideal system and I would like to improve it for RSCDaemon by automatically checking the registered IP location, asking questions like who is the longest friend on your account, etc. It’s quite difficult to ask questions that the owner would know but no-one else would though. I’m open to ideas.</p>

<p>After a while you have to draw the line though. It has been announced on the website multiple times and you’re reminded to set them every time you login. Even years down the line someone will claim they haven’t played since before they were set. Something had to be done because it’s quite hard to watch players simply quit because someone recovered their account because they had access to their e-mail for example.</p>
