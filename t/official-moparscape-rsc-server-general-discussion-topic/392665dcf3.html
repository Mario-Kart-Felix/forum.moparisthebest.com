<p>Without meaning to be biased it really is the only thing to look forward to. We’re putting a serious amount of work into this; hopefully it demonstrates to people that we do care about the scene and it’s not just a money making venture or whatever other negative things people have said about RSCEmulation in the past. I know a lot of people dislike me but to be honest I challenge any of you to run a server for approaching 3 years and not be disliked, if you ban someone for breaking the rules you’re instantly disliked by them and their friends. If you can’t recover their stolen items or deleted account then you’re instantly a bad/corrupt administrator. I want RSCDaemon to be a fresh slate with no grudges held as it really does seem to be the only hope for keeping RSC alive.</p>
<p>I don’t mean to sound big headed but people know I’m going to stick around and give the project my all doing everything I can to make it succeed so hopefully the hype of a fresh private server using a brand new event driven low latency server base that’s incredibly difficult to bot on combined with proven stability will attract a lot of attention. I’m not going to lie, I’ve made a lot of mistakes with RSCEmulation but I see this as a learning curve and a practise run. Believe it or not I do take the negative comments on board and hope to appeal to the larger audience this time round. I’m sure some people will continue to hold grudges and criticise it but ultimately it’s their loss; anyone that actually cares about RSC and wants it to continue will be all for this.</p>

<p>I hope your actually meaning what your saying, I don’t agree with everything you’ve done with RSCE as noone does, but I do agree that New Server = New Slate, sure you made some mistakes in the past but everyones got to look past that and realize it’s probably the only hope left with RSC, as MoparClassic seems to never be coming out. I look forward to a new server, I feel RSCE has progressed past the point of fixing unless it gets a complete whipe.</p>

<p>How about, you finish RSCDaemon and then you let it administrate by someone we all trust.</p>

Without meaning to be biased it really is the only thing to look forward to. We’re putting a serious amount of work into this; hopefully it demonstrates to people that we do care about the scene and it’s not just a money making venture or whatever other negative things people have said about RSCEmulation in the past. I know a lot of people dislike me but to be honest I challenge any of you to run a server for approaching 3 years and not be disliked, if you ban someone for breaking the rules you’re instantly disliked by them and their friends. If you can’t recover their stolen items or deleted account then you’re instantly a bad/corrupt administrator. I want RSCDaemon to be a fresh slate with no grudges held as it really does seem to be the only hope for keeping RSC alive.</p>
<p>I don’t mean to sound big headed but people know I’m going to stick around and give the project my all doing everything I can to make it succeed so hopefully the hype of a fresh private server using a brand new event driven low latency server base that’s incredibly difficult to bot on combined with proven stability will attract a lot of attention. I’m not going to lie, I’ve made a lot of mistakes with RSCEmulation but I see this as a learning curve and a practise run. Believe it or not I do take the negative comments on board and hope to appeal to the larger audience this time round. I’m sure some people will continue to hold grudges and criticise it but ultimately it’s their loss; anyone that actually cares about RSC and wants it to continue will be all for this.<br>

<p>How about, you finish RSCDaemon and then you let it administrate by someone we all trust.[/quote]<br>
And who would that be?</p>

Moparclassic is a good example why open-source projects where developers are pretty much doing charity work are not successful.<br>

I’m betting that it’s not very long at all, and most likely the very next commit.  More importantly, what is the time it takes for bugs to be fixed on RSCE?  Especially when you weren’t able to fix the bug yourself, and had to find someone else to do it.</p>
<p>Also, when it goes live I know I’m going to be checking it every 10 minutes or so.  I’m sure others will pay more attention as well.</p>

<p>Because MITB has shown very little interest in getting his own project online and is ultimately just a stranger over the internet that I’ve barely spoken to. He also assured me he was going to do something via PM and hasn’t replied since so as far as I’m concerned he’s unreliable.</p>

You’re criticized every day for a lot of other shit, why does something so unjustified bother you?  You have plenty of measures in place for users to recover their accounts, and it’s the users fault.  There is a certain point where you need to draw the line, and say it’s your responsibility to keep track of these things, and manually resetting them is over the line (especially because of the security risks).</p>
<p>Administrators have many other duties, and will be more than busy enough without having to manually recover accounts.  Therefore, their role is still useful.</p>

<p>Bot checks via teleportation are retarded, as anyone with half a brain would be able to detect and react to them.  Detecting them is trivial if you keep track of your position, and you could do something as simple as send the messages to Cleverbot and use the responses.</p>
<p>Here is a quick chat I had with Cleverbot:</p>
<blockquote>Are you there?
Yes, I am here.
Are you botting?
No.
What is your attack level?
5.</blockquote>
<p>There are other ways to do it, but that seemed like the simplest and most effective way of getting a good AI, though you’d need to respond only to mods. Which isn’t hard if you block chat.</p>
