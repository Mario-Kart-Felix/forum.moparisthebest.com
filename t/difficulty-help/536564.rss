    <description>[center][s]So I was reading over this tutorial on different experience modes. http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,545304.0.html 
And I&#39;m pretty sure I followed the tutorial correctly but, Everytime someone logs in it asks you to select a mode and I checked out the character file to see if it registered and the character file was blank? I think it has something to do with finishedTut. I&#39;m also wondering was is the meaning in the code below. [/s]

[code] if (!finishedTut) {       
                                getDH().sendDialogues(850, -1);
                                }[/code][/center]
