    <title>How is this Possible? (Java bots)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-is-this-possible-java-bots/3333</link>
    <description>This is so weird, there are bots all over Runescape, and no one knows where they came from, does anyone have any information on this?

Go on free worlds, Yew Trees below Fally, Draynor Willows, Lumby swamps.

Where are they coming from? This is not SCAR, because there is 3-6 at each spot, on several worlds, and not that many people use one SCAR script at one time.

The only thing I can think of? 
-Java bot made by someone here..
-Autorune was actually released.
-Secret private java bot was made. (But wouldn&#39;t more members no about it here?)


Enlighten me please, and check it out.</description>

<p>Nah, the Minimap automatically rotates, the only way to stop that is by making a bot that stops it, which would require deobing the client… <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Whats the difference between model and colour searching macro? Wouldn’t you still be using only 1 account since the mouse is required? And besides wouldn’t you have to client hack in order to use model macro since you’ll be looking for models instead of colours?</p>

              <p>My thoughts is they (whoever), have a program like SCAR, but instead of bitmaps or colors (DTM’s also), they have the program click on models. The reason I’m saying this is because I know that’s how SCAR will be soon (if someone ever updates it). Another reason is because someone here (forgot name) has made a model viewer already (that’s one step closer to a macro that looks for models instead of colors).</p>
