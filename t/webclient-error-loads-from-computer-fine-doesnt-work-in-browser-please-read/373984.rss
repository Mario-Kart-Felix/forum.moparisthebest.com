    <title>Webclient Error - Loads from computer fine - Doesn&#39;t work in browser Please Read</title>

    <description>Dear community members,

I have been trying to create a webclient for a long time now. I have followed different versions of tutorials trying to make one. In fact I got really close that it loads perfectly from my computer, only it doesn&#39;t work when I try to run it with an internet browser (I&#39;ve tried Firefox and Internet Explorer). I mainly followed Ric&#39;s tutorial and did some more editing to get the server and port correctly, not null.

Anyway, When I try to load the client from my website in the browser I get &quot;Client Updated - please reload client&quot; and then it goes into the &quot;Unexpected Error - Retrying in X&quot;. Here is a link to show you what I mean: [url=http://royalscape.clan.su/Webclient/Webclient.html]Webclient Error[/url]. (I am currently re-uploading my client.jar to my website so the webclient shows the client.class not found but once I get it back uploaded, it&#39;ll do the same Unexpected Error thing.

I am sorry if this is a bit wordy but I have searched and reseached this ever since I started this project, about a year ago. I would give up for a while, then decide to work on it more, take another break, work on it more. I&#39;m so close, I just need some support.

Regards,
