    <description> Dear community members,

I have been trying to create a webclient for a long time now. I have followed different versions of tutorials trying to make one. In fact I got really close that it loads perfectly from my computer, only it doesn&#39;t work when I try to run it with an internet browser (I&#39;ve tried Firefox and Internet Explorer). I mainly followed Ric&#39;s tutorial and did some more editing to get the server and port correctly, not null.

Anyway, When I try to load the client from my website in the browser I get &quot;Client Updated - please reload client&quot; and then it goes into the &quot;Unexpected Error - Retrying in X&quot;. Here is a link to show you what I mean: [url=http://royalscape.clan.su/Webclient/Webclient.html]Webclient Error[/url]. (I am currently re-uploading my client.jar to my website so the webclient shows the client.class not found but once I get it back uploaded, it&#39;ll do the same Unexpected Error thing.

I am sorry if this is a bit wordy but I have searched and reseached this ever since I started this project, about a year ago. I would give up for a while, then decide to work on it more, take another break, work on it more. I&#39;m so close, I just need some support.

Regards,

<p>When loading a class, don’t attach the “.class” to the end. Basically what the JVM tries to do with, for example “client.class”, it(the JVM) tries to load “client.class.class”, which is an invalid class name in the JVM, and is just weird(you wouldn’t do “java client.class”, you would just do “java client”).</p>
