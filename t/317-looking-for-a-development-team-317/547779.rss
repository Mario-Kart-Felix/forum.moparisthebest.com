    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-looking-for-a-development-team-317/547779</link>
    <description>[center]Hey Guys,
I am in the process of creating the PERFECT PK&#39;ing Server. I am using the [i]Lost Legacy[/i] base, which can be found here: http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-server/downloads/476948-lost-legacy-real-release.html

I am looking for a team of the following positions: GFX Designer, Web Developer, Server Developer, and Client Developer.
I have very little java knowledge, and a little bit of Web Design knowledge. My job is to oversee everyone, I will make sure everything is running how it should be. I have many ideas to keep each of you busy, and at the same time make our server the best PK server online. I will cover any and all expenses (VPS, Web Hosting), and if in the future I think you are doing a good job - I may contract you to a paid position.[/center]

[center]I will update this thread with more information/pictures later, but if you are interested in the job please do the following:
Add my skype: xerobots

Fill out an Application

Position Applying For:
Previous Work:
Years of Experience:
Any additional information:[/center]

[center]Things like age, and years of experience don&#39;t really matter. I&#39;m just looking for skilled people that are looking to become part of something big.[/center]</description>
