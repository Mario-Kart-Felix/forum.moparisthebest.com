    <description>Quite frankly I&#39;m tired of browsing the download section and seeing &quot;Leech! Quit coding and get the fuck off Mopar!&quot; (Yes, I&#39;m guilty of this as well, but I vow to change my ways) Everyone starts somewhere, to tell them to give up after one release is ignorant. If they give up, how could they possibly improve? They can&#39;t. Not to mention, half the people who accuse others of leeching have leeched themselves. 

If a certain release isn&#39;t to your liking, atleast post constructive criticism on how they can improve, or don&#39;t post at all. Nobody likes put-downs, and don&#39;t forget... everyone starts from somewhere.

tl;dr - Don&#39;t judge someone by their first release. They can and will improve, if they don&#39;t lose hope from all the shit talkers.

If you all have anything else you&#39;d like to add, by all means go for it.</description>

</aside>
<p>That’s one thing I said, yes.  The reason for much of the flame these days is because of the fact that so many people that were plain leeching were only doing so for the ‘fame’.  Look at some of those who are well known on places like R-S or R-L, because people love their releases, their ego grows quite high.  Same thing with server owners who treat players like shit and do ::hail every 15 minutes.</p>

Yeah, back in 2010, I didn’t recieve much flame when I released WorldRUINS 194. Oh, WorldRUINS, the most obvious leech in the Server Downloads section. Lol</p>
<p>But then, I started to look around in the code. I learned things such as switches, primitive data types, voids, and such. Later, I learned arrays and stuff, still had no flame.</p>

              <p>I’m not shy of telling them that it’s not a good/modern release, even if it’s their first.  Although people should provide more feedback besides “0mfg man this sucks ass for diner go kill your cat”, I have to agree that before releasing something, they should attempt to add some of their own content and code rather than just adding snippets.  It only takes common sense to figure out that if a tutorial thread has thousands of views that it will be common.</p>
<p>I also think people would flame less if they were releasing it because they’re legitimately done with their project, and not just putting it out there so everyone will say “Good job man!”.  If we praise them for doing nothing, it gives them some sense of importance, then they grow an ego, then they become an asshole.  It’s happened on servers I’ve played on many a times.</p>
<p>tl;dr:<br>
Giving praise for doing almost nothing won’t get them, or this site, anywhere.  Why do you think the first month after Hybrid PvP came out that it was basically re-posted a million times?  They were only posting it for the praise, not the knowledge of Java or what have you.</p>

              <p>No matter what anyone does or says the Server Downloads and Server Help sections will always be the most immature section of the forums; this is due to the high count of younger users and in-experienced programmers. If they wish to flame at each other then do so, as long as they keep it inside the RS2 Server Development category I couldn’t care less.</p>

              <p>Quite frankly I’m tired of browsing the download section and seeing “Leech! Quit coding and get the fuck off Mopar!” (Yes, I’m guilty of this as well, but I vow to change my ways) Everyone starts somewhere, to tell them to give up after one release is ignorant. If they give up, how could they possibly improve? They can’t. Not to mention, half the people who accuse others of leeching have leeched themselves.</p>
<p>If a certain release isn’t to your liking, atleast post constructive criticism on how they can improve, or don’t post at all. Nobody likes put-downs, and don’t forget… everyone starts from somewhere.</p>
<p>tl;dr - Don’t judge someone by their first release. They can and will improve, if they don’t lose hope from all the shit talkers.</p>
<p>If you all have anything else you’d like to add, by all means go for it.</p>
