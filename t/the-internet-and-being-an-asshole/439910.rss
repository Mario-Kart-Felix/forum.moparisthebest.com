    <title>The Internet and being an Asshole</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-internet-and-being-an-asshole/439910</link>
    <description>So, since I made this account I have essentially wondered the forums and gone around being a superior asshole to people. As a result I have gained 60 reputation. So, my question is thus: Is the internet just a place for people to express their extreme pent-up hatred for everyone else? OR does everyone just enjoy being a dick as much as I do?

I feel that at a basic human level people love to express their superiority over others and other people like to be able to see someone else suffer and go: &quot;At least I am not as stupid as them.&quot;, regardless of the truth of that thought.

Now, quite frankly, I have enjoyed myself so much that I am happy for people to just have a massive argument with me that quickly deteriorates into insulting each other&#39;s mothers (something which every argument seems to end on) but some actual discussion is also welcome. :)

(I like to think of myself as a researcher rather than an asshole :P)</description>

<p>Welcome to the internet. Get used to it, this is just how people are. Don’t be a hypocrite either, you’ve done it before.

On the internet, there are no consequences for calling someone a retard or a fag. It’s just how everything works.

<p>Well that’s just the thing. And is it a good thing or a bad thing? Removing the threat of physical harm means that people actually feel comfortable to express their true opinion, and, obviously, in some cases this is a truly bad idea. A great example of this is people who are dumping their boyfriend, girlfriend, husband etc over the internet. IRL they wouldn’t have the guts to do this and may have just stuck it out, whereas over the internet it is easy and impersonal and means that relationships can become a lot more fragile.[/quote]I’d slap dat woman if she tried to   dump  me online lols</p>
