    <title>[508] TrexxScape [508] [Day 5]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-trexxscape-508-day-5/542079</link>
    <description>[size=12pt][b]Hello, I figured I should start a topic on my new server I will be creating over a few weeks maybe even months.[/b][/size]

I decided after a 2 year break from coding/hosting I shall start again!  :D
It took me forever to find a 508 S+C that didn&#39;t have broken links or corrupt files.  :mad:
Now, I have only been coding for about 2 or 3 days but that doesn&#39;t mean I haven&#39;t added or coded anything. 
I have fixed various bugs/glitches/items already and coded the shops and other stuff.
I stripped InsidiaX&#39;s source and client and pretty much fixed what he left broken. (not saying he isn&#39;t a great coder  :))

Now, on to the media huh?  :D


[size=12pt][b]Added a &quot;Sell All&#39; button. (Plan on adding a &quot;Buy X&quot; button to)[/b][/size]

[size=12pt][b]Added Gold/Green/Red/Blue charms to the summoning shop![/b][/size]

[size=12pt][b]Fixed general store stock. (It seriously sucked)[/b][/size]

Now, I know this doesn&#39;t look like a lot. But remember I have only been at it for 2 or 3 days and I do have school. 
Now, as for the shops they have a colored names. 

Under Construction
Slowly working on this shop
Finished shop

I have also edited the cache a little. I will be updating daily except for on the weekends! (unless I have nothing to do.)

I plan on adding/coding much, much, much more content. This is the first time I have started a source/client and plan to release it.
All feedback (even negative) is welcome! I enjoy hearing every ones thoughts.  ;D


[size=10pt][b]P.S. If you have any ideas or tips I would love to hear them. :P[/b][/size]

EDIT: I have editing the cache, I changed a lot of logo/frame colors. The servers 2 main colors are obviously Blue/Black.
So that is probably why you&#39;ll be seeing a lot of stuff that is Blue/Black. It&#39;s not done but when it is I will upload photos!
