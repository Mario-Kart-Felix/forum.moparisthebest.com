    <title>Gathering interest to participate in the consumption and usage of a project</title>

    <description>Hello, my name is ranger squad and I am here today to gather a general idea of the amount of interest of the community to participate in the usage of a project,

Would anyone be interested in playing a &quot;fun server&quot; (like funscap3 or Allstar) if I was to create one?

Yours sincerely,
Ranger Squad</description>
