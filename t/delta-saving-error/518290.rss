    <title>Delta Saving Error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-saving-error/518290</link>
    <description>We have a delta client that saves accounts through sql. For some reason though it isnt saving. When you log out and back in its as if you never did anything and the account got reset. Pm me or ask for my skype through a pm, if it helps we can try doing this for a more visual effect and we can go through teamviewer through or something as well.</description>
