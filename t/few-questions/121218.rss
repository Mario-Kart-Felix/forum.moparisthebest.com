    <description>well i started a server yesterday, an i ned to know some stuff.

What is a client?

Whats the purpose of a client?

Cant a just add autospawn, shops.cfg and other things like that to the consle or do i need a client fo that?

I looked at the client page...but that didnt bring much help.

Take note that im just starting java, and its still a little new too me.

Thanks guys. :)</description>
