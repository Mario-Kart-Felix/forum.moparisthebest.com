    <description>How do I replace compress and replace a single file h0x53y39 (for example) to landscape.rscd?

I defined an area in point.java in the wilderness, how would I make just that area not in the wild like a safe zone?

I was trying to make a &quot; duel arena &quot; I made the players teleport to a certain location when the duel was started. How would I make them both teleport back to edge 20 seconds after the duel is over? Or how would you make the staked items show up in the winners inventory instead of the ground?

How did rune wars make a auto drop party?
