    <title>Few Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/few-questions/122933</link>
    <description>Okay..How would I make an Aggressive Npc, how do I edit his stats/max hit, [s]And how would I make him Drop things?[/s]
2)
I was going to try to make my OWN pking rewards system, I would Probably put it in the music tab as nothing is in there. But I Dont know where I would start..If anyone Could get me started (don&#39;t just give me a code to copy and paste, I want to do this on my own) It would be GREATLY appreciated.

[s]3) Is there a way I can make a mod/admin command that makes you completely invisible? [/s] 

4) Is there a way I can make the wilderness so it tells you how deep you are, and make it so that you have to be a few levels away to be able to attack the other person? ( Sorry if that didn&#39;t make any sense, &quot;I&#39;m wanting my wilderness to be just like RuneScape&#39;s Wilderness&quot;)
Thanks for any of your help :)</description>
