    <description>New at coding a 639, so i have a few questions..

I&#39;m using the Torvapkz 637 pk server, and it starts instant 138, how do i change it to were they can&#39;t have instant 138, just removing summoning from them so they are at 126.

Second question, How would i add objects, and add the command ::dice or add a gambler that gambles items..

Sorry if this is too much i&#39;m very new to this kind of server.</description>
