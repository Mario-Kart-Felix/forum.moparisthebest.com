    <title>Few Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/few-questions/455837</link>
    <description>What programming language should I learn first (i&#39;m into game development like runescape, a.v.a, etc). I know a little of html and css. Just web development doesn&#39;t interest me. I started learning blitz3d just to start knowing some basics of programming but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a strong enough language to make a game like runescape or a.v.a. 

Also what language should I learn for game development. C++ or Java? Which ones easier?

Also if this isn&#39;t the right spot, please remove. I&#39;m new to the forums.</description>

What programming language should I learn first (i’m into game development like runescape, a.v.a, etc). I know a little of html and css. Just web development doesn’t interest me. I started learning blitz3d just to start knowing some basics of programming but I don’t think it’s a strong enough language to make a game like runescape or a.v.a.</p>
<p>Also what language should I learn for game development. C++ or Java? Which ones easier?</p>

<p>You should find java easier to learn than c++. Learning c++ should be easier to learn after knowing java, I hear(not in all scenarios). Vice versa too. You should look into python.</p>
<p>Also blitz3d is definitely the funnest basic language to use and you theoretically could create games “like runescape”. But its not a good way to learn programming at all, it will only hurt you. I spent my whole early teens messing with it and I could never pick up anything else.</p>
<p>So theres some advice from someone who doesn’t program anything :o[/quote]</p>
<p>Ye blitz3d is a gay language. I mean the syntax (if it’s right) is really weird o.O. Thanks I started learning java from the newboston really good guy.</p>
