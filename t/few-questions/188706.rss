    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/few-questions/188706</link>
    <description>Hi, I recently created a server. I is off the source of Testscape. How do I change ALL the things that say &quot;Testscape&quot; to my server&#39;s name? 

~ And how do I change the text that appears as you log on?

~ And also, how do I change the commands, and what outfit you start out with?

~And my last question is how do I change some things I edited. I edited my stat levels to all &quot;1&quot; and it stayed the same what do I do?




Thanks for the help!!!!!!!!![br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 12, 2008, 02:46:54 PM[/size][hr]P.S. I&#39;m new at making servers... so don&#39;t treat me stupidly if some of the questions are semi-stupid.</description>
