    <title>Few Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/few-questions/524148</link>
    <description>Alright i have a few questions of to i need an answer, and would be grateful for one. As a side project i took DeathlyPvpz as a base, not alot of people like it but i find it very interesting to work with, I have cleaned most of the old nonsense that hid within the server, &amp; some things i have solved by simply re-reading what i have done, and searching in my files for an answer, yet i cant seem to find these.

Base - DeathlyPvpzV4.

Changing command entry ?
Where would i change the beginning of a command, using :: is just sloppy to me, id like to change it.  i just need a place to begin looking where i can attempt solving it myself.

What file handles this interfaces text ?

TripPk is the name of my server, so im assuming changing it in config.java made wherever handled the interface text change also. I&#39;ve checked client sided, RSinterface, AlertHandler, Client, also Ive checked files server-sided.</description>

<p>Question 2: If your talking about the “You currently have…”, or “Point Shop” then that is part of the interface, you would have to go into your sprites folder and edit the interface using photoshop or gimp or something. If you are talking about the “TripPk”, it looks like you already have found it.[/quote]</p>
<p>i know this, im asking is it possible to change this ?</p>
<p>I said when i changed +servername, it must have changed it wherever that text is handled.</p>
