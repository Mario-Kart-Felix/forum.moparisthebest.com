    <description>[b]Hey Moparscapers![/b]
[u][i][b]
Note; This is the post I had from when I released. This is currently removed.[/b][/i][/u]

[b]This source contains;[/b]
- Fixed ancient curses - Drains like real runescape.
- Vote4Cash (How to fix this will be in the end)
- Donor System (Shop with money)
- Pvp arm
- Pk points and pkpoint exchange.
- FunPK in the arena nearby Magebank.
- Runecrafting.
[b]And alot more that I couldnt be bothered to add in![/b]

[b]Bugs/Glitches[/b]
- The agility does not work, and I dont know how to fix that. Everything for agility is added, but it wont work. I added a command for agility instead. (::agility) Its a 1m fee per 100k agility xp.
- If you hit the player after you killed him in duel arena, you have to tele home, and stats will not be restored.
- The leech bug that idk to fix either, but you might figure out!
- The overload is a 1zip potion, can be fixed in [code]potions.java[/code]
[b]There is more though. You just have to find them.
[/b]

[b]Fixes[/b]
- Duel arena fully works, a few glitches which is easily fixed.
- Donator store
[b]Is a few more things, I just can&#39;t list them because it&#39;s so long since we did them.[/b]

[b]Some pictures.[/b]
The Fully working overload!
