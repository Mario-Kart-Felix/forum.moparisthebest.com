          <blockquote>
              <p>These are the questions that I’ve sent to Davidi2:</p>
<blockquote>1) To start this interview off - why don't you start by telling us a bit about yourself?
2) If you don't already work in such a field, do you think that you will ever program for a living?
3) Are there any users on MoparScape who you find particularly inspirational?
4) A lot of ex-staff fail to keep up activity after leaving - what makes you stay here?
5) What did you learn most about people in general during your time as staff?
6) How long do you think MoparScape will survive for, and remain as an active board?
7) Would you ever consider working on another RSPS project?
8) What originally brought you to MoparScape, and how did the forum differ from today's?
9) If you could make one change to the forum, what would you do?
10) Have you noticed any promising developments or discoveries recently?
11) If you could nominate a single song to be the MoparScape soundtrack, what would it be and why?
12) Is there anything else you want to say? A final comment?</blockquote>

              <p>A good question that we could ask would be “If you were still a staff member, what changes would you make to the forum?”</p>
<p>It’d be interesting to see his response, although it does have a possibility to just become an anti-staff ranting session. I trust David to be more mature about it, though.</p>

              <p>Here are some questions submitted for Davidi2 by Loveandpower</p>
<blockquote>1) Why did you quit being staff? (besides the obvious got tired of it/well deserved!)
2) is there any chance davidscape will return?
3) Why has your personality/attitude changed on the forums?
4) how does it feel having the most post count on the forums for well over two years running?( I think two years? )
5) Did you ever think you would be mod on here? How did you feel when you first became mod?
6) As a semi-veteran moparian if there was any advice you could give to the newer members what would it be?
7) Do you still program? If so, what language(s)? 
8) Tell us a little bit about yourself. Job,age, etc 
9) Do you have any future goals in either IRL or on Mopar itself?
10) If there was any one thing you could do on mopar for the better what would it be, and why? 
11) Anything else you would like to say?</blockquote>
