    <description>Hello, I&#39;m giving you the fact that we&#39;ve released the BETA and you can try it by registering at

http://inscapex.forumotion.co/t1-beta-announcement

and download there. The beta will be up for 12 hours, depends how many players come. So get there and go look around!
Although it&#39;s not 100%, the server is about 79% i&#39;d say. Come online now! http://inscapex.forumotion.co/t1-beta-announcement
