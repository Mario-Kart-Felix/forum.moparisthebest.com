    <title>Custom armor int&#39;s</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/custom-armor-ints/346082</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to learn how to code, got several things figured out, and I believe I&#39;ve figured out how to code weapon int&#39;s, but not armor int&#39;s. I made a custom platebody piece, and put it in my server, it went in fine, but when I equipped it, it took up my weapon slot, so how do I adjust which slot the item will go in?</description>

              <p>[quote=“staypuff, post:2, topic:346082”]You take the item id then goto item.java (serverside) and search for body. There will be something that looks like this:</p>
<p>int body{8801,8029,2671,9671…</p>
<p>Simply add your item Id into that list (make sure to add a comma after it.</p>
<p>It will look something like this:</p>
<p>int body{####,8801,8029,2671,9671…</p>
<p>But remeber for bodies you have to also add it to int platebody. (same way we did it for int body)</p>
<p>What it does:<br>
int body - this sets the item to equip to the body slot.</p>
<p>Int platebody - the removes the chest area where your model is going to prevent overlapping and messed up items.[/quote]</p>
<p>thanks! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> now my platebody equips to the right spot.</p>
<p>but there is one new thing, when I equip it, my characters hands (including wep and shield) move backwards behind the characters body, is this just my client or something else I need to fix?</p>
