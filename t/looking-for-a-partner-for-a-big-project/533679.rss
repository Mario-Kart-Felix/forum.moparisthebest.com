    <title>Looking for a Partner for a BIG PROJECT</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-partner-for-a-big-project/533679</link>
    <description>Hey guys, i got a VPS and I&#39;m looking for a partner to start a RSPS.
I&#39;m not looking to make a RSPS for like 1-2 Weeks. I&#39;m looking for a good big project to run it for years.
I need a guy who know a little bit how to code and how to make a webclient, etc.. I already have a .com Domain for the RSPS that we create.

We will split the donations that we get from people.

If you are interested please pm me and wen can talk more about it!
