    <title>Would someone be willing to</title>

    <description>[center][size=24pt]Sorry if I wasnt allowed to post this here[/size][/center]

Im not at all smart when it comes to php and phpmyadmin. Would someone but willing to give me a link (yes I&#39;ve already tried searching) to &quot;how to create a register/login.php?

I dont know what commands to run in mysql database. Im using smf forums and their users are in the databse as either &quot;members&quot; or &quot;smf_members&quot; (depending upon how the user set up the tables)

If i was able to find the link above, how do I make it when the user either registers on my home page or logs in than its check/registers in &quot;smf_members&quot;?

Thanks for any help guys</description>
