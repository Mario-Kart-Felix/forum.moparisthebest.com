    <title>Is there a way to change peoples levels without going into the char file?!?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-there-a-way-to-change-peoples-levels-without-going-into-the-char-file/226098</link>
    <description>I want to make it so when I use &quot;Rat posion (ID=24)&quot; on a player, it makes there attack level go from whatever they are at, to level 60 Attack.

I tried two things, and they did not work:

[code]		if(itemUseID == 24) {

p2.setSkillLevel(0, 60, playerLevel[0]);
		}[/code]

[code]		if(itemUseID == 24) {
p2.setSkillLevel(0, 60, 210000);
		}[/code]

Does anyone know how to make it work?
Thanks.</description>
