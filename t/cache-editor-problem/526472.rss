    <title>Cache Editor Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cache-editor-problem/526472</link>
    <description>Hey,

I wanted to edit my cache of my client but I could not get the cache editor working, When i downloaded there was only a source folder and no bin folder, so it was not compiled. I made a compiler.bat and a run.bat but still dont understand what the problem is, because the compiler gives me this error:

[code]
Error: Could not find or load main class bin.alex.Main
Press any key to continue . . .
[/code]

Is it possible if someone can check this out? The main class does exist at that location. I had to add zeros to the end of the name of the zip file because it would upload. So it does not mean anything.

Thanks.</description>
