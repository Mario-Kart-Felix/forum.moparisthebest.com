    <title>Requesting these Items to be packaged for me to download? :)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/requesting-these-items-to-be-packaged-for-me-to-download/353888</link>
    <description>FIRST OF ALL, A MOD TOLD ME TO POST IT HERE, SO I AM.

I was wondering if someone could package the ints and models of these items for me, and then lemme download it? :)?...

Dragonfire Shield
Staff of Light
all (or some) male/female Ele clothing
Gnome Scarf
Flared Trousers
Blessed Dragonhide Armour
Armadyl Robe Leg
Armadyl Robe Top
Frost/Blue Dragon Mask
Armadyl Chestplate and Chainskirt
Dragon Pickaxe

Note: i FAIL at coding, so if you ask &quot;why cant you do it yourself&quot;   my answer is: I&#39;M TO DUMB FOR THAT. -.-</description>

<p>Do not waste your breath on the hopeless. He will find out through life when hes out on his own that people wont be there to do everything for him. I have said enough and probably what everyone thinks of him. no need to outline it any more. his irrational thinking and irresponsible greed will get him no where.</p>

<p>Lol well your friend must be a noob who doesn’t know crap. Why don’t you go and grab the models and search for it with in the dat files you grabbed…theres a tutorial for that. Or ask your super knowledgeable sounding friend to help you</p>
<p>And it doesn’t take 15 mins lol. If you actually learned how you would know that. If you are that lazy, then you have no right to make a server. If you did its probably not that good. We here at Moparscape wont hold your hand like your mommy. if you asked “How can i learn how to do this” we would have more respect for you. But your selfish notions will get you no where in any forums of this type. We are coders not lakes to cater to your every whim.</p>
<p>Even the dumbest person can learn how to code. Because coding is about memory and common sense. Learn what the commands do and you can make anything.</p>

<p>Ints are not hard at all… the thing to do is use existing ints for an item and just position your drop model in the model editing program so it shows up well in the client.<br>
I suggest you <span class="bbcode-i">do</span> practice making them yourself and you will see how easy they are and you will feel silly that you made a help topic for something so simple <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
