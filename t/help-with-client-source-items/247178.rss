    <title>Help with client/source/items</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-client-source-items/247178</link>
    <description>sorry about my noobness im kind of new to creating private servers but i have a few requests and i thought id ask and hopefuly if not all atleast some of them i get help with. im not sure which affects the items in game the source or the client so excuse me if i get something wrong

sorry about being lazy but ive tried coding nearly empty sources and pre coded sources and its hard,
so i was wondering does anyone have a source and a client that i can use and that has specs, godswords, darkbow, has a reasonable amount of skills working, has decent areas. but if you find an uber awesome source and client then could i please have a link to download ill give major credits to whoever helps plus maker of client/source

my final request is a tricky one and it is driving me insane i have windows vista (which in greek means piece of beep) with a netgear dg834g router and i cannot get it to work so people can connect using my ip i made. i have no-ip  duc and ive followed guides maybe someone could talk me through it or use teamviewer to do it for me?

if i can get this sorted ill appreciate it so much and help you in any way i can even if its hosting your server 24/7

sorry about the essay and i apologise if i sound like im just trying to leech everything but im struggeling with coding stuff but im learning very slowly
many thanks.
