    <description>Hi, so after just recently trying to run the .bat file to run my client, I got this Windows security issue thing. I&#39;ve never had this issue before until now. I have tested my server using this client before several times, the exact same place, the exact same program/.bat file. So why did this happen, and how can I fix it?

Nevermind, solved it, weird</description>
