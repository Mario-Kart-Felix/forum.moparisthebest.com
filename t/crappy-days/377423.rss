    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/crappy-days/377423</link>
    <description>Have you ever had one of those days where you feel like god has just disowned you for that one particular day? 

This is what happened to me within the past 24 hours. . .

My Great Grandmother passed away from a heart attack. (going to funeral)
Then my Great Grandfather died (other side of my family) of old age (96) (died last night)
I wake this morning to find out that i have to go to a funeral for my friends Grandpa who died in a car accident (idk when).
And the final thing that happened about 15 minutes ago was my Itouch 4th gen broke . . .

Shitty day?</description>

              <p>Well I just came back from a funeral, the person died last Wednesday, the viewing was yesterday, so it took about a week for it all to take place…<br>
But anyways… You all should stop freaking out on each other for the most stupidest reasons.</p>

<p>for god sakes don’t be a jack-ass about this please. I know the words that are coming out of my mouth, do i know why? No. I remember when my aunt passed it was like this because she had diabetes and when she went to bed one night she didn’t wake up. It might be the autopsy, but idk. . .</p>

<p>You realize that you go to the funeral a week or two after they die right? I’m going to there funerals today</p>
<p>BTW peoples whole families die in one day and i’m pretty sure that is worse. Stop trying to act like you know everything because death is a daily thing not luck. . .[/quote]</p>

Have you ever had one of those days where you feel like god has just disowned you for that one particular day?</p>
<p>This is what happened to me within the past 24 hours. . .</p>
<p>My Great Grandmother passed away from a heart attack.<br>
Then my Great Grandfather died (other side of my family) of old age (96)<br>
I wake this morning to find out that i have to go to a funeral for my friends Grandpa who died in a car accident (idk when).<br>
And the final thing that happened about 15 minutes ago was my Itouch 4th gen broke . . .</p>
<p>Shitty day?<br>

<p>I think your bullshitting. 2 deaths and a funeral in 1 day? No ones luck is that bad.[/quote]</p>
<p>You realize that you go to the funeral a week or two after they die right? I’m going to there funerals today</p>
<p>BTW peoples whole families die in one day and i’m pretty sure that is worse. Stop trying to act like you know everything because death is a daily thing not luck. . .</p>
