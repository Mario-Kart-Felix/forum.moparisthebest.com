    <title>Need help editing a 562 ip changer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-editing-a-562-ip-changer/329459</link>
    <description>Ok so i downloaded the &quot;khanz 562 ip changer&quot;

It works fine...but how do i edit it? 

This is what i want to do:


[ul][li]Make the ip stay the same (so you don&#39;t have to type it in all the time)[/li]
[li]Put my servers name on it instead of it saying &quot;khanz 562 ip changer&quot;[/li][/ul]


Only thing is that there is no .java files to edit or a compiler...

And when i tried to edit it with DJ decompiler it said it was too big (but it opened it)
then i changed it and saved as a .java but i had no compiler...so i tried to use a compiler from my 317 source and i got an error...and it never worked...(i only changed 1 ip in the client.java because there was no gui or egui)

So how do i change these?</description>

              <p>it sounds like a closed source… try a differen’t cliend and make sure it says “open source” or “editable” before you download it.</p>
