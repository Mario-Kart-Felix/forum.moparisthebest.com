    <title>Memory Editing Plugin</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/memory-editing-plugin/2799</link>
    <description>WARNING: Use only if you know what you&#39;re doing.

Someone (might have been mopar) asked about memory functions in SCAR, and I had a plugin I started on a while back, so here it is a little cleaned up. Currently it only supports reading/writing dword values. Anything bigger, I might add later, but having write support makes it better than ACTool already.

[b]WriteDword(processID,offset,value)[/b] - writes the specified value to the offset in &lt;processID&gt;&#39;s memory space
[b]ReadDword(processID,offset)[/b] - reads a value at offset
[b]GetWindowProcessID(windowhandle)[/b] - returns the process ID associated with the window

<p>No, this is really meant for SCAR + other games. If you want to make a hybrid bot then ask RegeX for the source to his shared memory map thing, which is definitely my favorite way that I’ve seen it done (basically gives you a SendInterSCARMessage on the Java side). I don’t know what xSCAR used, but it seems to have legions of devoted followers in spite of the fact that it died withing 3 days of release, <a href="http://kaitnieks.com" rel="nofollow noopener">kaitnieks.com</a> collapsed, and semaphore quit. So it must have done something right?</p>
