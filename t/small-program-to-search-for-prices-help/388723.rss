    <title>Small program to search for prices HELP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/small-program-to-search-for-prices-help/388723</link>
    <description>hi there,

i wanted to make a small little program where you can type one of 100 names of an item in and you get a result which is the price of it.. i think i have to do it with java
i mean like this you type in Rune-platebody and get the result 50.000 or something. and i am sure that i have to safe these data like name and the price for it somewhere but how do i do that all?
Please dont tell me its in the wrong section, cause this is also a part of my server and i ve seen posts like this here already :)
AND yEs! Like moparscape has it just the problem is you have to run the client to open that xml file so if possible please just another way or not xml or wayne.. you are the helper :P

<p>I think that is what he means…however he will be unable to do it unless he actually learns Java. Ask Miss Silabsoft to make it for u <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
