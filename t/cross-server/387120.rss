    <description>Hey Mopar,

My Friend Has Sent Me The Files From His Server &quot;HaxScape&quot; Client + Source And I Love Them.

Last Night I Was Playing The Server Through Localhost And Then I Changed The IP&#39;s Back To The Normal Ones.

But Now That I Change The IP&#39;s Back To 127.0.0.1 And Compile Nothing Happens Except I Login To The Real HaxScape And Not The One Running Off My Computer, Any Help?</description>
