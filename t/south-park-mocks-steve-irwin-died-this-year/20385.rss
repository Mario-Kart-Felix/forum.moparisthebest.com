I think it&#39;s down right pathetic. South park go to far just for a laugh.

&lt;blockquote&gt;(Oct. 27) -- &#39;South Park&#39; is yet again the face of controversy after their Halloween episode this past week depicted the recently deceased Steve Irwin at a costume party for Satan.

[img]http://cdn.news.aol.com/aolnews_photos/0b/01/20061027115209990003[/img]

The brief appearance of Irwin, which showed the &#39;Crocodile Hunter&#39; with a stingray poking out of his bloody chest, even questioned its own taste. Irwin was appearing at a party for Satan, who then kicked out Irwin because he thought it was &#39;too soon&#39; and &#39;offensive&#39; for him to be making an appearance.

John Beyer of UK TV watchdog Mediawatch said the depiction of Irwin &quot;is such bad taste and the makers of &#39;South Park&#39; should review their decision to show it. Steve&#39;s family are still grieving.&quot;

&quot;To lampoon somebody&#39;s death like that is unacceptable and so soon after the event is grossly insensitive,&quot; he added.

Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the duo behind &#39;South Park,&#39; have yet to comment publicly on the controversy, but a spokesman for the show told a London newspaper: &quot;We have offended people in the past and probably will again. We know that regular watchers will not be shocked.&#39;&#39;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

it is a bit in poor taste, and seems to have little effect on the storyline, so should probably not be included…<br>

<p>South Park HAS a storyline???[/quote]</p>
<p>Not really, just midless killing that is supposed to be funny, or making fun of nearly everything they see. Either way, I love the show! Hehe.</p>

              <p>Yes it is sad that a man of such quality has died, but one HAS to move on.  If he wasnt famous, do you really think anyone would care?  Maybe someone would go “wtf… some guy got stabbed in the heart by a stingray”, but it woudl blow over ina day.  I know I sound a bit cold but this is quite possibly South Park’s message to all of us.</p>
<p>Plus, it is a common technique to get over one’s death by laughing and telling jokes as one would anyhow.</p>
<p>sorry, i have to do this:<br>

<p>oh and for the record: I really liked Steve Irwin.  A club im in at my school tries to raise money for his WildLife foundation as much as we can.  I think no one will really be able to do what he did [ive watched some of the newer guys, they suck, and i saw one get bit by a snake already].</p>

That’s different. Steve Irwin just died and people in Australia are practically still grieving and upset. Nobody cares that Jesus died, because (hopefully) they weren’t alive all those thousands and what not years ago.[/quote]</p>

              <p>I don’t think it was funny. They stept over the line this time if you ask me. Steve Irwan was one of Australia’s Icon’s and to be mocked like that, is not funny. Down right stupid. I have always been a watcher of South Park with my Dad, but I didn’t laugh once that episode, I actually left because I found it so stupid and appaurling</p>

Lol I just dled the episode and watched it. It wasn’t making fun of it, it was actually sympathizing him. He came to the Hell on Earth party and Satan was like “Dude about the Croc Hunter costume, don’t you think its a bit early?” Meaning he just died so its not funny to mock him. Eventually Croc Hunter tells him its really him and its not a costume and since Satan wanted everyone to wear a costume and Steve Irwin wasn’t wearing a costume he got sent out. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>

There was a link in the first page. And how does the Sting Ray in his chest show sympathy?</p>

<p>Yes I admit the Stingray part was tasteless but then hey, this is South Park the show that mocks and fucks every celeb.  Cruel yes, but we cannot really take action. South Park has done this to many other people as quoted “We have offended ppl in the past and we will probably do it again”</p>
