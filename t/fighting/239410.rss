    <description>Well, I was talking to a bunch of my mates today about fighting and stuff (not the talk like, &quot;I&#39;m going to bash such and such&quot;), more talking about why there are certain acts that are looked down in a fight, example kicking.

A lot of people think kicking in a fight is &quot;girlish&quot;, but I don&#39;t understand why, kicking is a LOT more powerful and effective than punching. But, apparently if you kick in a fight you&#39;re a girl? Which brings me to the main point in this topic:

Submission moves? I was just wanting to see what everyones views are on submissive moves and holds in fights. I, being a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu fighter know how to use proper submission holds, but it&#39;s apparently &quot;dog&quot; in a fight? I can honestly say I would go for a submissive move if the person tried to street fight and tackle me or whatever, until then I would use my Muay Thai martial art skills.

I was just wondering what all of your views on it are.</description>

when your on top of someone pounding the shit out of their face, you should learn to stop after a while.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah, when they can’t fight back.[/quote]<br>
Oh, I am all for that. When you have won, and they have submitted or asked for you to stop etc, then you should stop. Otherwise if you walk away, you’re getting a punch in the back of the head.</p>

<p>Uhh… Well let me tell you, Kicking is considered a girl if you street fighting, outside of that combat style isnt. Just plain ol martial arts. But you can only kick if you do a good combo which is likely to never happen.[/quote]<br>
Why would you say you need a combo. A simple roundhouse kick can produce more power than 4 big long arching punches. You don’t really combo with your legs, it’s simple. Use your hands to jab jab jab until they don’t see it coming. Big kick to the head, hitting in the right spot can cause devastating affects.</p>

<p>Almost all fights I enter are drug-deal related, or defending myself when I’ve been jumped. If someone jumps me and wants to steal my shit, I don’t care about fighting dirty I just care about leaving them as bloody and broken as I can without killing them and getting away safely.</p>
<p>I’m smaller and quite socially awkward around people I don’t know too well. This makes a lot of drug dealers think that they can take advantage of me. But then I return with my good 2 buddies who have my back and seriously it’s been pretty brutal sometimes what we’ve done heh. I probably get in a fight once a month, because of the people I am involved with mostly.</p>

              <p>Yes there may be rules to a fight, even though they aren’t really stated or agreed upon anywhere. I’ll do my best to cover them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always fight 1v1 unless it’s agreed upon otherwise.</li>
<li>Don’t go for the balls, don’t poke in the eyes. A fight ain’t a fight if your opponent can’t move or see.</li>
<li>Wait until your opponent is ready before attacking, a cheap punch will only show you have no confidence.</li>
<li>Never draw a weapon unless agreed upon before hand (unless your opponent draws one unfairly)</li>
<li>Don’t attack your opponent while he’s down. Once again, this shows lack of respect and lack of confidence. If you honestly think that you will lose unless you attack your opponent when down, then you deserve to lose!</li>
<li>Respect your enemies, for victory is not certain and either one of you could end up on the ground crying.</li>
<li>Finish a fight, but only if your opponent wants to finish it. There is no honor in attacking someone who does not intend to fight.</li>
<li>Remember each rule can and will be broken, so always be prepared – for the wiseman’s greatest advantage is the distrust of his fellow man.</li>

Agreed. But my point is, a lot of people think if someone is really tank and big they will pound the living day light out of you, which is why Jiu-Jitsu was revolutionalized by the Gracie brothers.</p>
<p>Say someone who is huge, and you get him to the ground via a BJJ take down method, which WILL bring anyone down, you’d think he’d just ground &amp; pound his way to victory, but if you got him into your guard, he will lose all power in his strikes, and if this is the case, there is basically a <span class="bbcode-i">Gator Choke</span>, as he won’t be able to defend it.</p>
