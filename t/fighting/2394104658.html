        <p>If you know a form of Jiu-Jitsu you’ll know that although kicking is powerfull, kicking can make you loose your balance very easily, the best way is to do what you have leaned. Get someone into a lock, all they think about is how are they going to get out, not how they are going to hit you. The next thing to do is make them loose thier balance and onto the ground. I’d suggest you learn some judo, it comes in very handy, I went to Judo classes when I stilled lived in Ireland, When i moved to Holland, I had and still have a hard time with the language. People like to make fun of me because I don’t always understand what they are saying. On my first week at school here, there was what you would call a typical dutch queer in my class. Someone who really studied how to tease people and bitch behnd thier back. I got really fed up and lost my tempet in class with him. The teacher had left to make some photocopies, although I couldn’t say shit I pulled him out of his chair after he started poking me and laughing at the fact of it. He fell to the ground. I let him get back up and swung a light punch. By this time he got anoyed and everyone started getting out of their seats to hold us back. As he swung for me a grabbed his arm and swung him into a seoi nage forcing him over my back and onto the floor in a split second. His foot ended up hitting a girl in the eye leaving here eye bruised. While all this happend a different teacher had walked past and noticed what was going on. I got pulled away while he was lying on the ground. This was my first week of school and I had managed to get suspended for a week, thankfully I was moved into a different class and everything turned out alright.</p>
<p>Point is most people think if you hit someone hard you’re going to win. That’s never the case. The case is if you hit someone properly you’re going to win the fight. I understand why people think kicking is a pussy way of fighting, because it’s not fightin with youre brain. Fighting with your feet wont hit them in painfull places unless you can stretch your foot to their head without loosing balance and knock them out in one hit.</p>
<p>I’f you want to fight like that you should do kick boxing. It’s like boxing only you get to kick aswell (obviously) there are points scored in different ways and shit. It’s really fun to watch</p>

Had you of read more than the first line of my post you would of realized I do do kickboxing.

My first week of Muay Thai lessons, all I did was basically stretch and a few drills.</p>
<p>Like, yesterday someone tried to fight me and said he would “punch my head off”, I simply laughed as he put his head right up to mine and said a few course words etc, and tried to trip me to the ground by putting his hand on my chest and leg behind my legs as to sweep me, I simply just grabbed his arm and put him into a Kimura shoulder lock, and told him that “I’m not fighting you, there’s no need”. Whilst he was squirming to attempt to break out of it, I just simply kept applying more pressure and told him that if he didn’t settle down and walk away I was going to break his arm (you might think that sounds so tough, but if you research the Kimura lock, you will see how powerful that shoulder lock is).</p>

<p>If you know a form of Jiu-Jitsu you’ll know that although kicking is powerfull, kicking can make you loose your balance very easily, the best way is to do what you have leaned. Get someone into a lock, all they think about is how are they going to get out, not how they are going to hit you. The next thing to do is make them loose thier balance and onto the ground. I’d suggest you learn some judo, it comes in very handy, I went to Judo classes when I stilled lived in Ireland, When i moved to Holland, I had and still have a hard time with the language. People like to make fun of me because I don’t always understand what they are saying. On my first week at school here, there was what you would call a typical dutch queer in my class. Someone who really studied how to tease people and bitch behnd thier back. I got really fed up and lost my tempet in class with him. The teacher had left to make some photocopies, although I couldn’t say shit I pulled him out of his chair after he started poking me and laughing at the fact of it. He fell to the ground. I let him get back up and swung a light punch. By this time he got anoyed and everyone started getting out of their seats to hold us back. As he swung for me a grabbed his arm and swung him into a seoi nage forcing him over my back and onto the floor in a split second. His foot ended up hitting a girl in the eye leaving here eye bruised. While all this happend a different teacher had walked past and noticed what was going on. I got pulled away while he was lying on the ground. This was my first week of school and I had managed to get suspended for a week, thankfully I was moved into a different class and everything turned out alright.</p>
<p>Point is most people think if you hit someone hard you’re going to win. That’s never the case. The case is if you hit someone properly you’re going to win the fight. I understand why people think kicking is a pussy way of fighting, because it’s not fightin with youre brain. Fighting with your feet wont hit them in painfull places unless you can stretch your foot to their head without loosing balance and knock them out in one hit.</p>
<p>I’f you want to fight like that you should do kick boxing. It’s like boxing only you get to kick aswell (obviously) there are points scored in different ways and shit. It’s really fun to watch</p>

<p>Had you of read more than the first line of my post you would of realized I do do kickboxing. Point is, I can kick people in the head, it’s actually not that hard, it took me a week to get that amount of flexibility. My first week of Muay Thai lessons, all I did was basically stretch and a few drills.</p>
<p>Like, yesterday someone tried to fight me and said he would “punch my head off”, I simply laughed as he put his head right up to mine and said a few course words etc, and tried to trip me to the ground by putting his hand on my chest and leg behind my legs as to sweep me, I simply just grabbed his arm and put him into a Kimura shoulder lock, and told him that “I’m not fighting you, there’s no need”. Whilst he was squirming to attempt to break out of it, I just simply kept applying more pressure and told him that if he didn’t settle down and walk away I was going to break his arm (you might think that sounds so tough, but if you research the Kimura lock, you will see how powerful that shoulder lock is).<br>

It’s impossible to have intelligent conversations with idiots like yourself involved. I am not trying to prove myself as being a tough kid, which is what a lot of people jump to conclusions when someone says they do some sort of fighting - fighting isn’t about two idiots swinging to the hills, it is an art and if done properly looks awesome, i.e kickboxing bouts.</p>
