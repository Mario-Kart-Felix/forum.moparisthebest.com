<p>If you know a form of Jiu-Jitsu you’ll know that although kicking is powerfull, kicking can make you loose your balance very easily, the best way is to do what you have leaned. Get someone into a lock, all they think about is how are they going to get out, not how they are going to hit you. The next thing to do is make them loose thier balance and onto the ground. I’d suggest you learn some judo, it comes in very handy, I went to Judo classes when I stilled lived in Ireland, When i moved to Holland, I had and still have a hard time with the language. People like to make fun of me because I don’t always understand what they are saying. On my first week at school here, there was what you would call a typical dutch queer in my class. Someone who really studied how to tease people and bitch behnd thier back. I got really fed up and lost my tempet in class with him. The teacher had left to make some photocopies, although I couldn’t say shit I pulled him out of his chair after he started poking me and laughing at the fact of it. He fell to the ground. I let him get back up and swung a light punch. By this time he got anoyed and everyone started getting out of their seats to hold us back. As he swung for me a grabbed his arm and swung him into a seoi nage forcing him over my back and onto the floor in a split second. His foot ended up hitting a girl in the eye leaving here eye bruised. While all this happend a different teacher had walked past and noticed what was going on. I got pulled away while he was lying on the ground. This was my first week of school and I had managed to get suspended for a week, thankfully I was moved into a different class and everything turned out alright.</p>
<p>Point is most people think if you hit someone hard you’re going to win. That’s never the case. The case is if you hit someone properly you’re going to win the fight. I understand why people think kicking is a pussy way of fighting, because it’s not fightin with youre brain. Fighting with your feet wont hit them in painfull places unless you can stretch your foot to their head without loosing balance and knock them out in one hit.</p>
<p>I’f you want to fight like that you should do kick boxing. It’s like boxing only you get to kick aswell (obviously) there are points scored in different ways and shit. It’s really fun to watch</p>

<p>Like, yesterday someone tried to fight me and said he would “punch my head off”, I simply laughed as he put his head right up to mine and said a few course words etc, and tried to trip me to the ground by putting his hand on my chest and leg behind my legs as to sweep me, I simply just grabbed his arm and put him into a Kimura shoulder lock, and told him that “I’m not fighting you, there’s no need”. Whilst he was squirming to attempt to break out of it, I just simply kept applying more pressure and told him that if he didn’t settle down and walk away I was going to break his arm (you might think that sounds so tough, but if you research the Kimura lock, you will see how powerful that shoulder lock is).</p>

<p>It’s impossible to have intelligent conversations with idiots like yourself involved. I am not trying to prove myself as being a tough kid, which is what a lot of people jump to conclusions when someone says they do some sort of fighting - fighting isn’t about two idiots swinging to the hills, it is an art and if done properly looks awesome, i.e kickboxing bouts.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Agree with you.</p>
<p>Also, I would wanna see you do that Kimura lock.<br>
Made me wanna youtube some fighting :P[/quote]<br>
It’s an extremely easy submission move, and if done properly will leave permanent damage within 5 - 10 seconds, held longer could easily cripple that arm.</p>

<p>I don’t think I am posing at all, and I never intended to - just because someone does something which seems “tough” and posts about it in a RELATIVE discussion, idiots such as yourself fly off the handle, I take no pride or good will doing what I did, which is using BJJ to my advantage, I’m just against school-yard fights, as they’re worthless.</p>

<p>Altough I do agree that when using a form of martial arts enhances your fighting skills, it doesn’t automaticly mean you are stronger then those of your age. Say you are 15, and quite good at karate or whatever. If you fight someone who is raging like a dog with rabies, and that person is heavier <span class="bbcode-b">and</span> longer then you, you’ll probably wont stand a chance (that person also has to be longer, because then his weight is distributed in the same way as yours). You can evade all you want, but one hit from that person and you are out of balance and he’ll finish you.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That is a common mis-consumption, that was the whole reason Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu was revolutionized by the Gracie brothers, it was a form of martial arts which proved that you need not be big and tanky in a fight, via the use of locks and choke holds, as when you get on the ground with your opponent, big isn’t necessarily always better - best example of this is Broc Lesnar vs Frank Mirr in UFC 81, notice how Broc utilized his wrestling ability and controlled Mirr and pounded him, but Frank kept his cool and brought the big guy down via a leg lock.</p>
<p>Lots of people say in a street fight Broc would of won, how so? UFC is street fighting, and if Broc did not tap out to that submissive move, he would be permanently crippled, don’t you just love BJJ <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smiley1bce.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>BJJ’s moves are easily lethal, and can kill - take Rafiel Toree as an example, killed a person via the Rear Naked Choke in 33 seconds.</p>

<p>Oh lets see…</p>
<p>Yz:</p>
<p>, being a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu fighter know how to use proper submission holds, but it’s apparently “dog” in a fight? I can honestly say I would go for a submissive move if the person tried to street fight and tackle me or whatever, until then I would use my Muay Thai martial art skills.</p>
<p>and tried to trip me to the ground by putting his hand on my chest and leg behind my legs as to sweep me, I simply just grabbed his arm and put him into a Kimura shoulder lock</p>

</aside>
<p>All you’re doing is proving yourself as an idiot, I have no shame in saying I do Muay Thai and BJJ, what is wrong with it? Are you jealous because I have something to say for myself? You’re coming of as more of an idiot than you appeared to be initially.<br>
