    <description>[b]REQUESTING SIG[/b]

  I need a sig made with the title &quot; Vicscape &quot; in it along with pretty small words named &quot; owned by vic 08 &quot; or something, be creative.
 
 If you could, i&#39;d like it to be pretty creative, along with something that catches your eye. No girly stuff and some other dum things. I am not really sure on what it should be i just want something that is pretty unique. HAving like a black background or something and dripping metal that spells out vicscape im not entirely sure on what it would look like, also maybe add some monsters? 

 I just want a sig that is pretty creative that i could advertise around.</description>
