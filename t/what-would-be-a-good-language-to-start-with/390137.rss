    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-would-be-a-good-language-to-start-with/390137</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking for a programming language that would be a great introduction into successful computer programming when I am older. I&#39;m 16 now, so what I work on as a kid I&#39;d hope will benefit me in my future.

Any ideas on something that won&#39;t die before I&#39;m ready for college?</description>

<p>Woah that really puts it into perspective. Although I can see you’re a C man…? You weigh up the two pretty fairly. The OP should have a better view on things now.</p>
<p>Nice read.</p>

<p>C has it’s benefits, Java has it’s benefits. since OP is asking what to start with i can only recommend either C or something with a little more friendliness like Python, and Python can be quite daunting when you delve deeply into it. i believe C is a better beginner language than Java for little more reason than simplicity and breadth of both language and general concepts.</p>
<p>with C, it’s a simple language; there’s little in the way of any real paradigm support apart from general imperative and structured programming. it lacks support for object orientation (although that can be easily conjured up) which definitely makes the language simpler at core and, in the context of concepts, there’s only pointers that many people consider a harder concept and they’re pretty damn easy in comparison to some of Java’s deeper concepts/wizardry.</p>
<p>a Java programmer, on the contrast, has to work with objects pretty much 99% of the time, they’re a fundamental concept in the language and thus must be learnt pretty quickly or one shall forever write ugly and bad code. and that’s excluding the concepts that are linked to object orientation like polymorphism and inheritance, which can really prove to be a bummer for the newbie programmer who’s just realised that the <span class="bbcode-i">extends</span> keyword exists. also there’s generics. no comment.</p>
<p>now, it’s a common misconception in many uninformed communities that C is one of the the ugly stepsisters (C++ is the other) and Java is Cinderella. i can assure you, from the standpoint of a beginner, Java will switch roles with C. yes, C can become the fucking ugliest stepsister of them all in the wrong hands; it’s flexibility can be it’s downfall, but for a beginner, you’re more likely to be able to write a little program faster with C than with Java because in C you have to use the best part of 2 or 3 functions in stdio.h. in Java, you’ll probably have to figure out a few classes and the relevant methods and somehow put it all together, placing <span class="bbcode-i">new</span> in a seemingly logical place and hoping that the result is a functional program. to even take a bit of input from stdin you need to either use the Scanner class or BufferedReader while with C it’s a simple as <span class="bbcode-i">gets()</span> (<span class="bbcode-i">fgets()</span> if you’re a safety whore and <span class="bbcode-i">scanf()</span> if you don’t give a shit). of course, C’s standard library is a lot smaller than Java’s and logically, over time it takes a C programmer longer to write something than a Java programmer because C lacks the type safety and the cater-for-all standard library (and pointers are likely to piss you off too). also, C <span class="bbcode-s">can</span> will become very ugly over time, Java is always a lot more legible in a bigger project and, according to TIOBE, Java is more popular.</p>
<p>tl;dr</p>
