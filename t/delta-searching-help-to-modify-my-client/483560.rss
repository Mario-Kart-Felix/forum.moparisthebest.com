    <title>[Delta] Searching help to modify my client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-searching-help-to-modify-my-client/483560</link>
    <description>[size=10pt]Hello[/size], I am using an old delta server and client.
I need help to modify the client so it sends the object packet to the server, when your are near the object. Example a ladder, I dont want people to click this ladder anywhere and you climb-up, i want it to work as when you click the ladder you walk to it and then you climb up.
The client is not refactored, so i cant really read it.
I am not really sure if its the client or the server, but i guess its client-related. And yes i know it is possible to fix it in the server source, but that would cause people to disconnect if they spam-click the objects.

Please dont post useless posts about im using delta, i&#39;ve heard them enough :-)</description>
