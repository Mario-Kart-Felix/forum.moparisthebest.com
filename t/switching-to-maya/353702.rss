    <title>Switching To Maya</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/switching-to-maya/353702</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, I would like to inform you all that I will be switching from Blender to Maya as I feel I&#39;ve progressed as far as I wish to with a program that will get me nowhere post-secondary school. Why did I choose Autodesk Maya? Well, for one reason, Maya (as well as 3DS Max) is used by many major companies in the gaming/movie effects industry, which is where I plan to end up post-secondary. The reason I&#39;m posting this is because I want you all to bare with me as I will be starting from scratch in order to learn a new program, so when I do feel that I&#39;m ready to start posting my models, do not expect them to be at the level I was in Blender (although, the rendering quality will be a lot better as Blender only has mediocre rendering capabilities). Please note that for those of you who do use Blender, don&#39;t think that it is a bad program as it isn&#39;t. But if you have plans on going into the 3D modeling/animation industry you will need to switch programs and its better to do so sooner than later.

*EDIT* I know this doesn&#39;t have much to do with models itself, but as I am never in any other section of these forums, I felt it made no sense to post elsewhere.</description>

Jagex uses Maya, actually. I can’t wait to see what you can pump out <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

<p><em>sigh</em> Jagex use their own programs.[/quote]Nope. There was a video in the RS Discussion board posted and Mark Gherard was in it talking about how they add content, and he mentioned they use Maya/Lightwave.</p>

<p>Yes, Maya is expensive but my parents have agreed to pay for both Maya and a new Quad core processor for my computer so I can actually USE a program properly. Right now my ability to model is VERY limited as my processor can’t support much of anything. Also, I chose Maya because I’m applying at the 6th best Art institute in N.America, which happens to be the only one placing in the top 50 that was Canadian. Wish me luck =D</p>

<p>Wait you pirated $3500 software but your going to buy it?</p>
<p>Did you pay the full price for the software, or did you get the student offer for non commercial and learning purposes?<br>
Is a hell of a lot cheaper, you can get 3ds max, maya, and a couple of other autodesk programs all for £160 (about $250).</p>
<p>Will you be using 3ds max aswell? or just Maya?<br>
I’ve heard Maya’s not great for rendering because you can’t get vray for it? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

I mostlikely will be getting the whole AutoDesk set of programs. Already have 3DS on this comp and now Maya. Atm I have them Pirated but will be getting them legally once I get my new processor (and completely clean out my hard drive.)[/quote]</p>

              <p>Hello everyone, I would like to inform you all that I will be switching from Blender to Maya as I feel I’ve progressed as far as I wish to with a program that will get me nowhere post-secondary school. Why did I choose Autodesk Maya? Well, for one reason, Maya (as well as 3DS Max) is used by many major companies in the gaming/movie effects industry, which is where I plan to end up post-secondary. The reason I’m posting this is because I want you all to bare with me as I will be starting from scratch in order to learn a new program, so when I do feel that I’m ready to start posting my models, do not expect them to be at the level I was in Blender (although, the rendering quality will be a lot better as Blender only has mediocre rendering capabilities). Please note that for those of you who do use Blender, don’t think that it is a bad program as it isn’t. But if you have plans on going into the 3D modeling/animation industry you will need to switch programs and its better to do so sooner than later.</p>
<p><em>EDIT</em> I know this doesn’t have much to do with models itself, but as I am never in any other section of these forums, I felt it made no sense to post elsewhere.</p>
