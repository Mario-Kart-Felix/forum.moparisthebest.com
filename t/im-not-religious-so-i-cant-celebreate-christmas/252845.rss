    <title>Im not religious... so i cant celebreate christmas?</title>

    <description>Ok, so i am Agnostic, not christian...

when people hear about this for some reason they get offended that im celebrating Christmas.
Well Screw You



Christmas is no longer religious. Christmas is about Santa and presents, no one gives a shit about the previous reasons of it except for a low percentage of religious fanatics. 


Sure some guy that alot of you think is super cool was born on this day but we have all gotten bored of you telling us about it so this is what you get. Christmas is no longer religious. 


Seriosly, 5 to 10 years ago, i couldnt go 2 mins without seeing a manger in the middle of a shopping center or a cross hanging on someones door. Now the only indication you get that its christmas is the flashing lights, the fat red men and the copious amounts of presents. 


Non Religious people rejoice! We have taken Christmas! The day that Christ was born is no longer a religious day</description>

<p>You’re a complete fucking idiot, shut up. I’m sick of you posting about me in every single topic you post in. Just because in one topic I speak about my faith, and shed some light on certain issues doesn’t make me resident Bible Boi. You don’t know me, and I hope it stays that way. Stop acting like you’re better than anyone, you’re not, in fact, far from it.</p>
<p>The entire subject, religion, should be banned from the forums. I’m so sick of people hijacking threads that have very little in common with some form of religion. I’m sick of idiots posting topics about religions to get a hot topic going. I’m also very sick of ignorant people who claim to be a religious person, yet know nothing about their religion. And in turn destroy the reputation of that religion.</p>
<p>If you bunch of douche bags would quit flaming people because of their faith then this wouldn’t be an issue. Sure he was asking for it. But even still, be the better person and let it go. There’s no reason to turn a one page topic into 3 pages of spam. The obvious reason for it even being made was to get some posts out of it.</p>
<p>This should be locked.</p>

The entire Christian religion is filled with hypocrisy. I once heard a sermon where the priest said that perhaps there must be an inherent amount of hypocrisy for the church to work. He then went on to criticize the people who criticize the catholic church, something about well organized journalists who have nothing better to do. Bullshit much? I think so.</p>
