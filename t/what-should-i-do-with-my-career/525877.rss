    <title>What should i do with my career?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-should-i-do-with-my-career/525877</link>
    <description>Hey guys, i am going through bit of a bind right now. All my life i have been very interested in going the Marines or Navy Seals or even the National Guards as iv always enjoyed to help people and taking pride in making people happy. I am wanting the roll in combat BUT, Im extremely good with computers so my family and everyone says &quot;if you go into the armed forces, you need to join the technical side&quot; But the thing is, im not really interested with the technical stuff. I think i would have more fun in combat and exploring the world. I am just going as a freshmen in highschool this year and i know i have a long time to think but who thinks what would be better for me?
Note:
I love to work out &lt;3 :D
Push-ups in a minute: 62
Sit-Ups in a minute 42
Pull-Ups Max: 19
Max Running distance so far: 4 Miles Straight</description>

<p>Thanks guys, i am mostly setting my mind to the Marines branch in combat.

<p>I don’t see how putting your life on the line every day is something beneficial for your family. But you’re free to do whatever you want with your life so, go right ahead.</p>

<p>If you want to give your family a “good life”, you will most likely want to consider even going into the military, because it will occupy a good bit of your life, especially if you put into active service.</p>

<p>Veterans have alot of advantages in life. But keep in mind (idk alot but) If they are required in war… and needs drafts<br>
you might be forced in. You might die or be a disabled veteran. It’s very dangerous once you are in war. No way out</p>

I’m not talking about Janitors. I’m talking about a self employed beer bear that goes to parties to make money with no actual schedule or sense of job security. Obviously in this economy there is very little job security, however as a beer bear there really can never be a promised sense of security in one’s job. Nor is there an opportunity to advance in a corporate ladder. However this entire discussion is completely off topic and not what OP is looking for so I suggest we end it here and continue on with the actual subject.</p>

Why are you asking us what YOU should do with YOUR life…<br>
Do what you enjoy doing and is a well paying job to support yourself and your family (if u have children etc)<br>

<p>yeah do whatever the fudge u want[/quote]<br>
Ever heard of a guidance counselor? That is basically what he is asking the community to be. to give their views on possible careers he could have. Obviously in the end it is what he wants to be, but it is always good to hear from people around your age, as well as those who already have careers, to see what may or may not persuade him to a specific career.</p>

<p>You sound more like you’d rather go out and play with death making a low-ish wage than actually go in the military to make a living, which is a bad idea IMO.</p>
<p>I’d suggest joining the Air Force, better living conditions, you get to keep your life, and when you join as an officer you get paid pretty well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.military-ranks.org/air-force/captain-pay" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://www.military-ranks.org/air-force/captain-pay</a></p>
<p>You are guaranteed the rank of Captain (O-3), after 4 years in the service.</p>
<p>And what’s this about you saying you would have “fun” in combat? No you wouldn’t. Nobody does, talk to mostly any enlisted marine. They almost always get out after their 4 year term is up because they don’t wanna go back to that. Its rough out there.</p>
<p>You’ll go in all gun ho and come out lucky to be alive, if you do.</p>
<p>As for the Navy, iirc it isn’t that easy to become a seal, you have to work like hell, much longer than your 4 years to get to that point.</p>
<p>tl;dr: No Marines, no Navy, no National Guard, Air Force is the best road, Army is far behind in 2nd.</p>
