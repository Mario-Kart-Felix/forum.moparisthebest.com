    <description>[size=20pt]Hey guys! [/size]

[size=12pt] :) I&#39;m looking for a partner and or partners for a project I started a while agooooo. :)[/size]

[size=10pt]I had a great time coding some basics for this source such as new home, shops, training all that noob stuff![/size]

Once I had that It was time to get a functioning client, and web-client which was a little bit of a challenge.

I have a working client connected to server with name, etc. But it needs some work done on it since it seems people downloading it have had complications.

I have ran a server before a long long time ago in almost my first week of even getting into runescape private servers..Not to brag really but it had like 30+ players for a while, i&#39;m not saying thats really that good and actually bragging but I guess it okay for starting out? :D

I have gotten in contact with someone who can host the server and know someone who can get it out there a bit more once its released with a runescape youtube channel with over 8k subs!

I made a server development thread on it a while back with lots of pictures so feel free to take a look:

I hope you are interested since I really wanna get the server going but just need some help! I hope the colors arent giving you a headache either! Thank you!</description>
