    <title>Adding a new method to Script.java to to work with BSH scripting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-a-new-method-to-script-java-to-to-work-with-bsh-scripting/507186</link>
    <description>Been having trouble figuring out what i would need to write to add a &quot;repeat option&quot; so that i can repeat PickOptions... I was thinking SendMenu1, SendMenu2, SendMenu3, SendMenu4 ect...

Each time I do a PickOption i have to remove 1 option out of the pick option SO:    

option(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;); it ends up if i choose option 1, i have to remove option 1 so its option(&quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;); it ends up if i choose option 2, i have to remove option 2 so its option(&quot;3&quot;); it ends up if i choose option 3, i have to end it there.. no more options...



example of What i want:

SendMenu(1);

SendMenu(2);


if(SendMenu = 1);
option = PickOption(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;);

if(SendMenu = 2);
option = PickOption(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;3&quot;);

that way i dont need to remove pickoptions til its out of options...</description>

<p>The word “coding” is sometimes used instead of the word “programming”, because it’s shorter. The meaning is the same. We use it occasionally at work.

<p>As for that second bit, there is a difference, and a large one at that. Programming is the development of computer software applications via a programming language of some sort, while of the other hand coding is what RS2 narbs (probably like yourself) say to make themselves look cool in front of friends irl.</p>

              <p>Been having trouble figuring out what i would need to write to add a “repeat option” so that i can repeat PickOptions… I was thinking SendMenu1, SendMenu2, SendMenu3, SendMenu4 ect…</p>
<p>Each time I do a PickOption i have to remove 1 option out of the pick option SO:</p>
<p>option(“1”, “2”, “3”); it ends up if i choose option 1, i have to remove option 1 so its option(“2”, “3”); it ends up if i choose option 2, i have to remove option 2 so its option(“3”); it ends up if i choose option 3, i have to end it there… no more options…</p>
<p>example of What i want:</p>
<p>SendMenu(1);</p>
<p>SendMenu(2);</p>
<p>if(SendMenu = 1);<br>
option = PickOption(“1”, “2”, “3”);</p>
<p>if(SendMenu = 2);<br>
option = PickOption(“1”, “3”);</p>
<p>that way i dont need to remove pickoptions til its out of options…</p>
