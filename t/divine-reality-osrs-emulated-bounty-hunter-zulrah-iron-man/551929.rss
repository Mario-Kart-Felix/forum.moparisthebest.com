[spoiler=Latest Update]Hi guys, bringing you a new update thread and latest news.

Hello guys! Made quite a few updates throughout the day today so I just thought I&#39;d share them here.

- New NPC definitions have been added which should help make combat much better in terms of how wacky the hit calculations have been lately.

- You can no longer hit insane amounts  of damage with magic like 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s, every magic combat spell now has a damage cap.

- Burning fish will now no longer give you the incorrect burnt fish; for instance, burning Tuna and receiving burnt shrimps in your inventory.

- PID randomization has been added, so now PKing and the Duel Arena should pose much more of fair challenge.

- An ::price &lt;item&gt; command has been added which will allow you to search for the shop, low alch, and high alch prices of any item.


There are lots more updates to come! All of these will take effect on the next server restart.


New npc-definitions added 
  {
    &quot;id&quot;: 239,
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;King Black Dragon&quot;,
    &quot;examine&quot;: &quot;The biggest, meanest dragon around.&quot;,
    &quot;combat&quot;: 276,
    &quot;size&quot;: 5,
    &quot;attackable&quot;: true,
    &quot;aggressive&quot;: true,
    &quot;retreats&quot;: false,
    &quot;poisonous&quot;: true,
    &quot;respawn&quot;: 60,
    &quot;maxHit&quot;: 45,
    &quot;hitpoints&quot;: 240,
    &quot;attackSpeed&quot;: 7,
    &quot;attackAnim&quot;: 25,
    &quot;defenceAnim&quot;: 26,
    &quot;deathAnim&quot;: 28,
    &quot;attackBonus&quot;: 250,
    &quot;defenceMelee&quot;: 290,
    &quot;defenceRange&quot;: 300,
    &quot;defenceMage&quot;: 230
  },


We can now customize combat to be much more accurate and enjoyable.

You can now un-note and note items by using them on the bank[/spoiler]</description>
