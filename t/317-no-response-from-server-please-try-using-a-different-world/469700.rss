    <description>I believe I have all my settings correct...

[ul][li]IPs are set to 127.0.0.1 in client.java[/li]
[li]Environmental Variables are set to my jkd[/li]
[li]Canyouseeme.org says &quot;Success: I can see your service on 75.***.***.*** on port (43594)
Your ISP is not blocking port 43594&quot;[/li]
[li]I have a static IP set (It wont work with a dynamic or static)[/li][/ul]


I think all of these are correct right? Is anyone willing to take a look at my files through TV? If not can you please tell me what I&#39;m doing wrong? I know it&#39;s possible to get it to work on my PC because I ran my server with no problem a week ago. And I just can&#39;t remember what it was that I changed :S It stopped working when I unplugged my laptop to bring it to a friends house so maybe it&#39;s something to do with my IP? Please help I&#39;ve been at this for a week already and nobody was of any help ):</description>

<p>I put my server ip in Rune*<a href="http://locus.com/statuscheck.html" rel="nofollow noopener">locus.com/statuscheck.html</a> and it says my server is online.<br>
And my ip is the same on my portforward as the static Ip…</p>
