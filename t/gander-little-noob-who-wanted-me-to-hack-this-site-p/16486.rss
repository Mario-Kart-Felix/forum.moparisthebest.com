    <description>Proof that Gander was trying to get me to hack this site ;)

[url=http://www.megaupload.com/?d=AJ45H7AD]http://www.megaupload.com/?d=AJ45H7AD[/url]

Proof that Gander used and modded me to get enough info so he could sue me (which I doubt he can do, but it&#39;s what he says)

[url=http://www.megaupload.com/?d=0JODZM6J]http://www.megaupload.com/?d=0JODZM6J[/url]

If you need the codec to play the videos download codec here:

[url=http://download.techsmith.com/tscc/tscc.exe]http://download.techsmith.com/tscc/tscc.exe[/url]

Alternatively you can download VLC player which can play videos which use nearly any codec:

[url=http://www.videolan.org/vlc/]http://www.videolan.org/vlc/[/url]

I felt the need to post this as Gander has posted this bs on his site which is making people turn against me. Rofl you can&#39;t crack MD5s without brute forcing, which takes awhile and rarely works.

Here&#39;s what he&#39;s posted on his site, and he mentions SMF, I don&#39;t recall there ever being SMF on rs-server -.-:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Yes, its true xerocheez abused a bug and released the rs-server sql with all your passwords in it, yes they are md5 hashed, but There easy to crack, i cracked my own password in seconds, its true, belive me or not i don&#39;t care, but xeroz doesn&#39;t care about anyone, except him self, he is your enemy, he released his server attacker to screw all your servers up, he hacked this site so many times, he&#39;s immature, he released all your passwords, he always picks on someone thats better than him at coding, previous examples include : whitefang, fasga, silabsoft, slysoft, ramenryoko.


He&#39;s also released this so called video that shows me asking him to hack mopar, which was cooked, the only thing he ever hacked was the old smf boards that he used a nooby perlscript to get in, thats it. the video was cooked I know it was because I know I didn&#39;t type that, he&#39;s trying to frame me, my old rs-server password which was my old msn password was the same, he md5 cracked my old rs-server password from the database he got, then hacked my msn and framed me.


Belive the immature selfish screwed up kid, or belive me, either you do or you don&#39;t I&#39;m not going to make you.

Belive me or not I don&#39;t give a shit, either belive me or that screwed up kid.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

Dear members of Rs-Server,<br>
As some of you will of noticed, Gander is quitting Rs-Server and Private Servers.<br>
Gander did request that I ban him, but he changed his mind, he is still, however, quitting</p>
<p>I am very sadend by Gander’s leave and I wish he’d come back…<br>
But, he seemed pretty darn confident in his decision.</p>
<p>I will soreley miss Gander, he was a very respected members of the forums, a wonderfull admin, and a great friend…<br>
I’ll miss you buddy!</p>
