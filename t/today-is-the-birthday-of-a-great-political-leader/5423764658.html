        <p>[quote=“Loveandpower, post:20, topic:542376”]Adolf may had never did anything that was “good” for Germany, or any other country ( albeit besides dying ) but even I have to admit he was a wonderful public speaker.</p>
<p>Happy Birthday Adolf. Make sure to pick a  giant pineapple for the occasion to get shoved up your ass in whatever type of hell you are probably in.</p>
<p>/inb4 religion<br>
/inb4 movie fanatic[/quote]</p>
<p>To say he never did anything good for anyone is incorrect (unless you see good/bad as a scale, and his bad actions “cancel” his good ones).</p>
<p>[ul][li]Nazi Germany was worried about animal conservation, and introduced hunting laws to protect animals (especially those native to Germany).[/li]<br>
[li]They gained a lot of medical information, especially hypothermia (although unfortunately this was gained through human experimentation).[/li]<br>
[li]Ever wore Adidas shoes, or other pieces of clothing? You have Adolf “<span class="bbcode-b">Adi</span>” <span class="bbcode-b">Das</span>sler to thank for that. If you’ve ever wore Puma, you have Rudolf Dassler to thank. Both brothers were members of the Nazi party.[/li]<br>
[li]What about Werner Von Braun, who helped create the Saturn V rocket which placed man on the moon?<br>
[/li][li]What do you think about the Volkswagen Beetle? Hitler himself said that it should look like a Beetle.[/li]<br>
[li]In World War I, Hitler achieved two iron crosses for bravery - is that not a “good thing” for Germany?[/li]<br>
[li]Nazi doctors were the first to write a scientific paper linking smoking to lung cancer. Hitler was a staunch anti-smoker.[/li]<br>
[li]Thanks to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichserbhofgesetz" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">1933 Farm Law</a> farms were assured sales and given subsidies.[/li]<br>
[li]The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_Through_Joy" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">KdF organisation</a> provided cut-price leisure activities for German workers, regardless of class.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>The Nazis committed atrocities. The Holocaust was one of the worst things, if not the worst thing to happen in the history of humanity. Hitler was the leader of the Nazis, and as such was responsible for the atrocities committed. However, to say that neither the Nazi Party nor Adolf Hitler did anything “good” for the people of Germany or the people of modern society is pure ignorance.</p>

<p>Of course, Hitler committed atrocities. However, as Vain said, Hitler was not a comic book villain. He did what he did in pursuit of greatness for Germany, he did not do it to be evil.</p>

Somewhere in his brain he would have known what he was doing was bad, unless he was mentally ill. If he was trying to better Germany then why did he bother torturing the Jews? Why did he bother keeping them alive in concentration camps to starve, spread sickness to each other and eventually die from torture? Why not just exterminate the Jews right away and move on to the next? He didn’t do these things because he thought he was doing Germany a favor, I think it was because he was a just sick person who had the power to embrace his own beliefs. He believed everyone that wasn’t Nordic was inferior and his actions speak on his behalf. I had a quick look around and it seems as if Hitler did very little for Germany, besides provide jobs and apparently put poverty on a halt (remember this was to his benefit). He made irrational decisions that lead to the loss of battles and soldiers that continued all the way up to his death.</p>

<p>I think you’re all missing the point. Nothing can justify killing one person nor ~six million (as per modern estimate).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think you’re also missing the point. No one is attempting to justify it.</p>
<p>If a newspaper writes “the serial killer, today sentenced to life in prison, was severely abused as a child”, do you get up in arms about how “nothing justifies murder!!!”? I’d hope not, because that’s <span class="bbcode-b">not attempting to justify it</span>, it is (partly) <span class="bbcode-b">explaining it</span>. If you can’t take part in a sensible and civil discussion without placing your fingers in your ears and shouting as loud as you can, fudge off and find another topic. This isn’t the topic for childish behaviour.</p>
<p>I’m not saying what Hitler did wasn’t evil. I’m saying that he didn’t do it just to be evil. He was trying to better Germany, he didn’t skulk around in blood-covered lederhosen thinking about how to get into the League of Supervillains.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Somewhere in his brain he would have known what he was doing was bad, unless he was mentally ill. If he was trying to better Germany then why did he bother torturing the Jews? Why did he bother keeping them alive in concentration camps to starve, spread sickness to each other and eventually die from torture? Why not just exterminate the Jews right away and move on to the next? He didn’t do these things because he thought he was doing Germany a favor, I think it was because he was a just sick person who had the power to embrace his own beliefs. He believed everyone that wasn’t Nordic was inferior and his actions speak on his behalf. I had a quick look around and it seems as if Hitler did very little for Germany, besides provide jobs and apparently put poverty on a halt (remember this was to his benefit). He made irrational decisions that lead to the loss of battles and soldiers that continued all the way up to his death.[/quote]You’re still glorifying him, hence the rise of neo-Nazism.</p>
<p>As for Tabby, he did better Germany in many ways and ruined it in others. It’s not black and white, but overall he ended up crushing their economy (post-war), un-doing most of what he “achieved” and cost them great humiliation (the German people are very patriotic/nationalistic, it’s one of the reason why WW2 was even able to occur). One possible explanation as to his hatred of jews is his miniscule (and his mentors) involvement in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thule_Society" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Thule Society</a>. Another is the fictitious <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a> which I recall him having read, incorporated into German education and even notes it in his book, Mein Kampf.</p>
<p>For the record, most of my arguments are bias because I do not tolerate the spreading of anything that even seems pro-Nazi. I disagree with such ideology wholeheartedly and that’s why I’m upset by such posts and thus my further moderation which seems a personal vendetta.</p>

<p>I’m sorry, did you just accuse me of <span class="bbcode-b">instigating neo-Nazism</span>? You delirious piece of shit! Neo-Nazism where? I’ve never had an indepth discussion about the Nazis in real life (it’s close to impossible because there is always someone who covers their ears and just repeats “any discussion of Hitler is glorification”). There are also rarely discussions on the MoparScape forums due to moderators not allowing discussion of it.</p>

<p>Are you trolling? I hope you are, because if not you are looking like a moron. If you accept that your arguments are biased, and you’re not willing to have a proper discussion on a <span class="bbcode-b">discussion thread</span> without acting childish, then leave this topic and go somewhere else. We’ve already explained why we don’t believe that Hitler was inherently evil; that is not a pro-Nazi viewpoint but instead is a pro-human viewpoint. No one on Earth, past nor present, is completely good or evil - saying the same about Hitler does not make me a pro-Nazi.</p>
<p>If you’re unable to hold a mature, composed and adult discussion on the matter then go somewhere else.</p>
