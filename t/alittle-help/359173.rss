    <title>Alittle Help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/alittle-help/359173</link>
    <description>Anyways, its my brothers birthday today, and he got a thing called a &#39;Creative Zen V Plus 2GB&#39;
Its an MP3 player.. Personally idk why he didnt ask for an iPod, but thats what he wanted so thats what he got.

Anyways, im having some trouble putting music on it, i hook it up with my USB and nothing happens, i dont think its detecting it. The Zen is full charge and stuff, when i try to copy music with wma it doesnt detect it, but i can see that the computer found it. I looked in My Computer for plugins and stuff, still nothing. Can someone help me put music on this? Its starting to piss me off, ive been trying for 3 hours now and my brother is getting mad.</description>

              <p>I think you just plug it in the computer and drag-and-drop the mp3s by opening it up as external storage, much like you would an SD card or USB memory stick.</p>
