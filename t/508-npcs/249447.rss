    <title>[508] NPC&#39;s</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-npcs/249447</link>
    <description>Hi guys, i was just wondering if anybody knows how to code in a few NPC&#39;s? I am deciding to scrap my 317 and move on to 508&#39;s but i need help D: 

The thing i am trying to acheive is add NPC&#39;s to train on and also add NPC&#39;s just beneath the wilderness so that you can get food, change spell book etc.

Can anybody help me?

(Didn&#39;t know if this was correct Section, sorry if it isn&#39;t)</description>
