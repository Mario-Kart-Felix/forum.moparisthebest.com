    <title>Someone threw a lolipop at my bus driver (FML)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/someone-threw-a-lolipop-at-my-bus-driver-fml/312468</link>
    <description>Today I was riding home from school on the bus and the bus driver said something that someone threw a lolipop at her, and she was going back to school if no one admitted to doing it. So no one admitted and we went back to school. The 2 administrators came on the bus and started to ask questions like &quot;Who did it?&quot; and &quot;Admit it NOW!&quot;, etc... No one admitted again, so apparently now the police is going to get involved, state trooper people, etc... And now I was 20 mins late.

FML.

<p>Today I was riding home from school on the bus and the bus driver said something that someone threw a lolipop at her, and she was going back to school if no one admitted to doing it. So no one admitted and we went back to school. The 2 administrators came on the bus and started to ask questions like “Who did it?” and “Admit it NOW!”, etc… No one admitted again, so apparently now the police is going to get involved, state trooper people, etc… And now I was 20 mins late.</p>

<p>Today I was driving these douche bag kids from school till some dick threw a lolipop at me… and I said if no one admitted to doing it I’d go back to school. So no of these faggots admited it so we went back to school. And I called up 2 of the administrators and they’re like “WHO DID IT???” and like “ADMIT IT NOW!”, etc… No one admitted again, so I decided to place charges. and those state trooper niggers. etc… And those faggot kids were 20 minutes late.</p>
