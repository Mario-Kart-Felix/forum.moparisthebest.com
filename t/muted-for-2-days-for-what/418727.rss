    <title>Muted for 2 days? For what?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/muted-for-2-days-for-what/418727</link>
    <description>Hello,

I just logged into my Rune|Scape account to find it has been muted for 2 days. I don&#39;t event know what I did to even get this mute. So, I went over to the appeal and offense and hoped to see if it had anything about why I was muted. Turns out that there was nothing there about this said mute and my account is still in the Green Zone. Now, I am waiting and waiting to hear something from Jagex about why I was muted. Anyway, I don&#39;t really know what to do other than what I am doing now. I wish I could post on the R|S forums but I can&#39;t because I am muted and &quot;banned&quot; from the forum while the mute lasts. I just felt like telling someone about this, if anyone will even care. I am at least glad I got it out of myself into words.

              <p>I still have not received any evidence of the offense from a J-Mod yet. It’s been practically the 2 days now, however, I still want to know why I was muted in the first place.</p>
<p>Edit: Oops! I looked at it wrong. I still have one more day of being muted. That still gives Jagex time to review it and show evidence. (I hope…) I don’t mind being muted so much as not knowing why.</p>

A two-day-mute is not that bad though, at least it wasn’t permanent and I’m guessing Jagex hasn’t gotten to the report because they check all mutes made by moderator at least they say the do, which could be a lie. Anyway, just wait for two days.</p>

P-mods don’t often talk, you know how annoying it is talking ingame and having people swarm you asking questions?</p>

              <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I just logged into my Rune|Scape account to find it has been muted for 2 days. I don’t event know what I did to even get this mute. So, I went over to the appeal and offense and hoped to see if it had anything about why I was muted. Turns out that there was nothing there about this said mute and my account is still in the Green Zone. Now, I am waiting and waiting to hear something from Jagex about why I was muted. Anyway, I don’t really know what to do other than what I am doing now. I wish I could post on the R|S forums but I can’t because I am muted and “banned” from the forum while the mute lasts. I just felt like telling someone about this, if anyone will even care. I am at least glad I got it out of myself into words.</p>
