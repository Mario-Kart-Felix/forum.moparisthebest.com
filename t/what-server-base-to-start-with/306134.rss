    <title>What server/base to start with?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-server-base-to-start-with/306134</link>
    <description>Hello,

I am starting a server and i want your help to choose a base/server that would agree with the following requirements:

Please try to give the exact name of released server if possible (download link)

1. Stable
2. Not custom made / Not made from Scratch, example: Not hyperion, rs2e, shard
3. Most Importantly based on winterlove so i should be able to configure and edit it
easily, difficulty of editing it out of 5 could be 3
4. If it is winterlove based then lots of help is there if i am stuck.
5. Latest features: special attacks, support for latest 377 items or just 317, skills,
magics and etc
6. clutter free / cleaned: if it does have skills, it does not matter, or quests, or
minigames,

So overall, LATEST 317 server which is STABLE and has been in development for quite some time and whose creator was generous and wise enough to released it.

If it is Delta or Czar then it should be heavily fixed and stable

question: would devolution 2.7 be closer to above requirements then emulous 1.7 or runefusion or rs2e?

Thank you in advance and remember your answer will help a lot of other people.</description>
