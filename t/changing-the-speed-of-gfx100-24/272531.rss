    <title>Changing the speed of gfx100(24);</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-the-speed-of-gfx100-24/272531</link>
    <description>In my drawback method, I have
[code]    else if (playerEquipment[playerArrows] == -1) {
	gfx100(24);
    }[/code]
And that lines up perfectly with pkingdelay = 5, but since Arrows] == 1) { is Cbow, I would like the pkingdelay to be 3.  So how could I get gfx100(24); to go fast enough to line up with pkingdelay = 3?

Thanks.</description>
