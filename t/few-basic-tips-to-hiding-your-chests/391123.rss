    <description>[b]Introduction[/b]
In the past a hacker seemed to have replaced everyones chests with dirt. Even though the chances of a hacker are very slim, it may be a bit more safer to hide them


[b]Tip 1:[/b]
Place your chest on top of your roof (very effective if your house is on a hill)

[b]Tip 2:[/b]
Since chests cannot be destroyed by lava, put your chest behind lava. Or place behind a cobblestone generator. [b]Warning, be careful not to place the lava close to wood[/b]

[b]Tip 3:[/b]
Build a decorative fountain and hide it under the water (water is see through so using dirt as the bottom of the fountain blends with the chest, depending on the texture pack. 

[b]Tip 4:[/b]
Hiding your chest inside a mine you have made is quite ideal, but remember where you have hidden it

[b]Tip 5:[/b]
Hide your chest under your floor

[b]Tip 6:[/b]
If you&#39;re going to hide your chest underground then go outside and dig 3-5 blocks down and place it there, but remember to fill the gap up so no see through texture packs and get to it.

[b]Tip 7:[/b]
Hide your chest in the ocean, or somewhere in a lake. I would prefer a more open water since its more than unlikely someone will stumble upon it

[b]Tip 8:[/b]
Hide it with your mob trap, if anyone tries to get to it then they will have to fight mobs

[b]Tip 9:[/b]
Build a fireplace with a hole behind it big enough to place your chest

The first 8 tips were selected by Tom and myself, if you wish to suggest some then please do so. All help is appreciated</description>

If you tried to mine just a block of diamond carelessly sitting there, the floor would wall in and lava would be released around you.</p>
