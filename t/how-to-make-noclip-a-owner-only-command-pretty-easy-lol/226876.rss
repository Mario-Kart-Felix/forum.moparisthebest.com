    <title>How to make noclip a owner only command (pretty easy lol)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-noclip-a-owner-only-command-pretty-easy-lol/226876</link>
    <description>OK since this is so short i cant post it in the tutorials section  ;D
since ::noclip is a client sided command you cant just stick &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 3 on it.
but it is about out that simple to make it owner only or mod only if you like.  anyways basically if you have a command in your client.java that start with noclip its not the noclip command its a command to kick or ban yourself so you cant use noclip (kinda confusing :confused:..) anyways it&#39;s really simple to make that command ban everyone but the owner (or admin or mod whatever works for you) 
ok if you have the command in your client.java alredy good but the command should look like this
[code]        } else if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;noclip&quot;) &amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt;= 0)) {
            PlayerHandler.messageToAll = (playerName
                    + &quot; tried to noclip and has been autobanned!&quot;);
            appendToBanned(playerName);
            disconnected = true;[/code]
all that command is saying is that it will auto ban you if you type noclip
now if you leave the command like it is and change the 
[code]playerRights &gt;= 0[/code]
to
[code]playerRights &gt;= 3[/code]
it will make it so evryone can use noclip except for the owner..and..you don&#39;t want that
so what you do is change
[code](playerRights &gt;= 0[/code]
to
[code]!(playerRights &gt;= 3[/code]
notice that i added a &quot;!&quot; to the beginning of the (playerRights &gt;= 3 ok i will explain
a &quot;!&quot; reverses whatever is behind it so instead of making it ware owners cant use noclip and everyone else can it will make it ware owners can use noclip and everyone else cant =D see what im saying?
kinda confusing at first but i hope this helped =D</description>

            disconnected = true;</code><br>
all that command is saying is that it will auto ban you if you type noclip<br>
now if you leave the command like it is and change the</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">playerRights &gt;= 0</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">playerRights &gt;= 3</code></pre>
<p>it will make it so evryone can use noclip except for the owner…and…you don’t want that<br>
so what you do is change</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">(playerRights &gt;= 0</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">!(playerRights &gt;= 3</code></pre>
<p>notice that i added a “!” to the beginning of the (playerRights &gt;= 3 ok i will explain<br>
a “!” reverses whatever is behind it so instead of making it ware owners cant use noclip and everyone else can it will make it ware owners can use noclip and everyone else cant =D see what im saying?<br>
kinda confusing at first but i hope this helped =D</p>
