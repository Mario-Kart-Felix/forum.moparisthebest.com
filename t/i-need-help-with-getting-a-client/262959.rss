    <title>I need help with getting a client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-getting-a-client/262959</link>
    <description>I need help, I dont know if this is where this belongs. But when I download a client something always pops up that asks me what I want to open the file with, I can&#39;t get around it I need help, I am not really good with computers so you&#39;ll have to bear with me. Any suggestions?</description>
