    <title>Regarding Linux</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/regarding-linux/44303</link>
    <description>I&#39;m currently using WinXP, but I wouldn&#39;t mind switching over to Linux. I&#39;m planning to use AegeanLinux, which is a distribution made by a mate of mine from school (his username on these forums is TimG). Personally, I like it. But I&#39;m also a pretty Windows dependent person... So far, I know that Linux has their own version of a text editor etc, and I am also aware that there is Open Office.

What I want to know is this:
1. Does Open Office basically generate the same file types as Microsoft office programs? (For example, does it make .ppt files in powerpoint, which I could then email to school and use in Microsoft powerpoint? The same goes for .doc files, and the like... I&#39;m sure you get the idea).
2. I read in a post here that there are about 40 Linux viruses of which about 30 odd were lab-born? Is this true, and do I need anti-virus and firewall software etc, or is Linux virtually secure (I also read somewhere or was told that these viruses can only attack files in the user directories or something?)
3. Does Limewire Pro and an easy to use Bit Torrent program run on Linux?

If you can clear these things up, I&#39;d be very grateful. As you can no doubt tell, I know little about Linux.
Thanks guys and girls. :)</description>

Ok, thanks for that. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I just needed to check, because I’m doing two IT type subjects for the next two years, and I wouldn’t mind dumping Windows. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>One other thing - Spyware doesn’t affect Linux either I take it?</p>
