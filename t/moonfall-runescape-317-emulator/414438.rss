    <title>Moonfall - Runescape 317 Emulator</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moonfall-runescape-317-emulator/414438</link>
    <description>It&#39;s been awhile since I&#39;ve thoroughly browsed these forums. Today I noticed the lack of individuallity of content in the Server Development and Server Downloads sections. Besides winterLove derivatives for 317 and 508+ servers there are mainly alterations of iClarity and Azure, which are based off of RuneSource and custom half-built frameworks that implement the Netty and MINA libraries. I find networking libraries to be way too bloated for RSPS and it is impossible for myself to utilise them to the best of their ability with my limited knowledge of their API.

So I decided to start writing an open-source framework for the community that differs from these, just for a little variety. Heres the catch, I&#39;m using standard Java IO and not NIO... Now initially I expect to meet responses of &quot;idiot...&quot;, &quot;winterLove rewritten...&quot; and et cetera. While NIO is useful for serving responses to thousands of clients, there is some overhead in the reactor pattern that would be a performance downfall on a basic private emulator hosting approximately 50-100 clients.

But I&#39;m not going for a thread-per-client model as this is efficient when serving short responses to clients, not maintaining a consistent session (as is done in a MMO). At the moment my emulator uses 2 threads (one for listening to connection requests and another to process network IO for connected clients). The reason the listener has it&#39;s own dedicated thread is because it is blocking.

My plans for this framework are just that. A framework. I haven&#39;t played Runescape in years and haven&#39;t played the 317 revision in over half a decade so my ability to add skills and perfect combat would be poor compared to most of this community. To me this is just a basic project to improve my programming skills and knowledge in standard Java IO, the Runescape update and movement protocol and client to server networking models. So I plan to stop development of this (should I reach this point), after implementing multiplayer updating and movement.

Now while I have nothing against RuneSource, it was how I was introduced into RSPS&#39;s, it doesn&#39;t teach overly good abstraction and OOP programming techniques. I have recently had some interest in working on my old project Stonefall, and writing a Stonefall 2.0 if you will. Starting from scratch using a fresh svn grab of RuneSource. But I feel this project will be more rewarding. So without further ado, click the link below to download my source and give me some feedback as I work on this.

I had a look at winterLove’s and some of it’s derivatives and figured they taught poor conventions and practices. Other than that the rest of my knowledge comes from reading others work as well as random tutorials in The Java Tutorials. I moved from RSPS to my own game development and read up on all the tutorials for Java 2D graphics. I read a book (Killer Game Programming in Java) and plenty of others work from the Java-Gaming community. My high school offered no IT subjects, and I’m currently in a gap year before I attend University next year where I will be studying Computer Systems and Software Engineering as well as a Business course.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah, I’m taking a web design course where I can get certified then I’ll just move on to Computer Science and then AP computer Science.</p>
<p>Look forward to more updates</p>

              <p>So I’ve run into a problem I guess. All I’ve done so far is send the load map region packet to the client. It either then disconnects me client-side or displays the loading message. I thought I may have done something wrong with setting up the cipher but it is deciphering opcodes from the client successfully (I tested this by entering chat text. The server then received the opcode 4, which is correct for chat). I’m sending an encrypted opcode byte of 73, followed by the size of the packet payload which is 4, then I’m sending two shorts, for the map region x and y. The first short is a Special A type.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>It’s been awhile since I’ve thoroughly browsed these forums. Today I noticed the lack of individuallity of content in the Server Development and Server Downloads sections. Besides winterLove derivatives for 317 and 508+ servers there are mainly alterations of iClarity and Azure, which are based off of RuneSource and custom half-built frameworks that implement the Netty and MINA libraries. I find networking libraries to be way too bloated for RSPS and it is impossible for myself to utilise them to the best of their ability with my limited knowledge of their API.</p>
<p>So I decided to start writing an open-source framework for the community that differs from these, just for a little variety. Heres the catch, I’m using standard Java IO and not NIO… Now initially I expect to meet responses of “idiot…”, “winterLove rewritten…” and et cetera. While NIO is useful for serving responses to thousands of clients, there is some overhead in the reactor pattern that would be a performance downfall on a basic private emulator hosting approximately 50-100 clients.</p>
<p>But I’m not going for a thread-per-client model as this is efficient when serving short responses to clients, not maintaining a consistent session (as is done in a MMO). At the moment my emulator uses 2 threads (one for listening to connection requests and another to process network IO for connected clients). The reason the listener has it’s own dedicated thread is because it is blocking.</p>
<p>My plans for this framework are just that. A framework. I haven’t played Runescape in years and haven’t played the 317 revision in over half a decade so my ability to add skills and perfect combat would be poor compared to most of this community. To me this is just a basic project to improve my programming skills and knowledge in standard Java IO, the Runescape update and movement protocol and client to server networking models. So I plan to stop development of this (should I reach this point), after implementing multiplayer updating and movement.</p>
<p>Now while I have nothing against RuneSource, it was how I was introduced into RSPS’s, it doesn’t teach overly good abstraction and OOP programming techniques. I have recently had some interest in working on my old project Stonefall, and writing a Stonefall 2.0 if you will. Starting from scratch using a fresh svn grab of RuneSource. But I feel this project will be more rewarding. So without further ado, click the link below to download my source and give me some feedback as I work on this.</p>
