    <title>Good USB-stick distro, with encryption?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/good-usb-stick-distro-with-encryption/418240</link>
    <description>I can&#39;t seem to find what I want here, and I&#39;d think it would be easy.  I need a distro meant to run from a USB stick, which means it doesn&#39;t mount the stick as a standard filesystem (like ext2, etc) because that will cause it to burn out from many writes to the same location.  It needs to instead run from RAM, and put the files back on the USB stick afterwards.  I&#39;ve found a few that supposedly do that.

But to add to the mess, I&#39;d also like to encrypt the whole root fs with dm-crypt with LUKS, but if that can&#39;t be easily supported, I&#39;d settle for encrypting the home partition the same way.

Any ideas?  (Knoppix looks like it could work, but the torrent tracker is down (no .torrent files to download), and I can&#39;t find a single mirror that works with a recent version, pretty crappy...)</description>

              <p>dm-crypt and yes, that’s doable, but it’s not good for your USB stick because, since it’s meant for a hard drive, it writes far too much to the USB stick, drastically shortening it’s life.</p>
<p>The best combo appears to be squashfs containing the initial OS image, then an encrypted file loop-mounted to contain your personal changes, and a unionfs over both of them to make them appear the same.  I might play around with ubuntu to see if I can get the same result out of it that way.</p>

              <p>By the way, Knoppix is the way to go.  It can save your data to a aes-256 encrypted container, which is over-layed over the read-only filesystem so you can edit the system anyway you like.  It’s also debian-based (even uses the debian repos), so you can apt-get to your hearts content.  It’s the perfect USB-stick distro!</p>

              <p>Well, reading from flash media can be done a virtually unlimited number of times, it is writing that can only be done so many times before it is permanently damaged.  Most USB-stick distros I have seen combat this by mounting the USB stick file-system read-only and use union-fs to combine that with a filesystem in RAM.  Then at intervals or at the end when shut-down, it writes these changes back to the USB stick.  That is what I mean, basically anything that minimizes writes to the USB-stick.</p>

<p>He probably means that you save the data on RAM, and then write all data from RAM back onto the USB stick when you shut down. So you only use read/write from USB stick twice, on start-up and shutdown.</p>
