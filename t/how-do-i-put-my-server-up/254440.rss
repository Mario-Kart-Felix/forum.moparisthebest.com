    <title>How do I put my server up?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-put-my-server-up/254440</link>
    <description>I did everything except one thing.

that thing is stopping me from making a server.

Can someone tell me how to put my server up?
I didn&#39;t do port fowarding cuz i dont have a router, i got e-wire.
I got everything set up, no-ip, files, etc. I just don&#39;t know how to connect to it.
I used silab client trying to test my server, but it didn&#39;t work.

contact me at msn: polasik@live.com

im running utorrent with correct settings, no-ip, anything else?</description>
