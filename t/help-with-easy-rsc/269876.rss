<p>All the commands you are able to use will be in the CommandHandler.java (server side). As for sounds, I am not sure. It’s not something i’ve looked into, sorry.</p>

<p>I haven’t come across anything about quests publically released, so try and work on one yourself. Adding quest list in the game where the “Info” options are is done in the mudclient.java (client side).</p>

<p>You’re welcome <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>To edit the command ::stuck, you will have to search for it in the CommandHandler.java which is server side. Search for “stuck” and change the coords that are in player.teleport(x, y).</p>
<p>To make your rank, you need to go into the players folder, that is also server side. Find the name of your account name. Open it in wordpad. Search for “rank” and then change that from 0 to one of the numbers listed below.</p>
<p>0 = Normal player<br>
2 = Pmod (green crown)<br>
3 = Mod (silver crown)<br>
4 = Admin (yellow crown)<br>
5 = Muted<br>
6 = Banned</p>
<p>Items can be modified in the ItemsDef.xml that is located server side in the defs folder. Note: Anything you change in this file will also require you to change the Items.rscd file (client side) to exactly the same.</p>
<p>Also, if you are wanting to change specific stats of an item once it has been wielded, then that is done in the ItemsWieldableDef.xml which is server side.</p>
<p>As Blade said, all item, object, npc and skill IDs can be found in the “docs” folder.</p>
<p>Once you have made yourself Admin, you can use the in-game command ::item   to spawn yourself items.</p>
<p>Good luck, and remember; if you have anymore questions, please don’t hesitate to contact us <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Take care, Dylan.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Yong-Min</p>

<p>Make sure you have “server=localhost” in your settings.ini</p>
<p>Yes, you can just make a username and log in, however it sounds like you’re using the newest version of EasyRSC, so you <span class="bbcode-b">can not</span> have spaces in the username.</p>

<p>With EasyRSC, you just enter any desired username and password and hit login ^^</p>
<p>That will automatically create that account for you. You can then find the account created in the players folder.</p>
