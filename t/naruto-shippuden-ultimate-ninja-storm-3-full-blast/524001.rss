I know it&#39;s a DLC, but it&#39;s quite the annoucment considering you get to be Sage Kabuto, you also you get all of the DLC costumes that were released previously. I guess the price determines whether I am going to pay for what should have already been in the game or not, I will guess 1200msp, $20.

But from this I am guessing that the anime/manga is coming to an end. I mean if they were going to release another game then they would do so next year but by the the anime/manga would have finished or past this part so I guess they&#39;re pushing out games for people to buy before it ends, in other words you&#39;re buying the story early. More money for them I guess.



Oh, and no Edu Kages. [size=1pt]that we know of[/size]</description>
