    <title>Odd error when running on VPS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/odd-error-when-running-on-vps/551374</link>
    <description>UPDATE (EDITED) -
Problem: 
When my client is connected via my VPS and is connected, it will do this -  http://prntscr.com/723w68 &amp; http://prntscr.com/76v8zr when I login (with an account that was already made before it was brought over to the VPS)


Tips: 
When a new player account is made when running on the VPS it works and is slow, but will end up doing what I stated above after a few days.
When I run my client using my localhost, it runs perfectly with no issues
When I click around it will not move my character
I can still click through the player tabs
It will not let me log out, I have to exit the client</description>

              <p>The information you’ve provided here doesn’t explain anything…</p>
<p>However, this looks like your server isn’t sending the packets to the client correctly. As I’ve had this happen a few times while playing some servers. I’d load the client, download the cache, and try to login, it would display the game world, but the map would be black (as seen in pic 1). After like 20 seconds it’d actually dc me and upon re-connection it would fix.</p>
<p>The simplest way I could say to fix this would be:<br>
Check the packets being sent to the client against the data in the client. If the client is expecting to read 1 byte, then make sure your server sends… 1 byte. And so on.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><code>
				c.getOutStream().createFrameVarSizeWord(53);
				c.getOutStream().writeWord(3900);
				c.getOutStream().writeWord(TotalItems);
				int TotalCount = 0;
				for (int i = 0; i &lt; 22; i++) {
					if (c.getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[i]) &lt; 99)
						continue;
					c.getOutStream().writeByte(1);
					c.getOutStream().writeWordBigEndianA(skillCapes[i] + 2);
					TotalCount++;
				}
				c.getOutStream().endFrameVarSizeWord();
				c.flushOutStream();</code></p>
<p>Here’s the code for sending a shop in a typical PI. (Specifically the skillcape shop)<br>
As you can see, it sends a “createFrameVarSizeWord” at the beginning. Which tells the client “Hey there’s going to be a strange amount of data in this packet, it won’t always be one size”.</p>
<p>And then when you look for packet 53 in the client:</p>
<p>[code=java]<br>
case 53:<br>
needDrawTabArea = true;<br>
int i7 = inStream.readUnsignedWord();// The interface id… or 3900 as seen in the code earlier.<br>
RSInterface class9_1 = RSInterface.interfaceCache[i7];<br>
int j19 = inStream.readUnsignedWord();// The size… or how many items that will be read.<br>
for (int j22 = 0; j22 &lt; j19; j22++) {<br>
int i25 = inStream.readUnsignedByte();// How many of the one item will be displayed… the “1” in writeByte in the for loop.<br>
if (i25 == 255)<br>
i25 = inStream.method440();<br>
class9_1.inventory[j22] = inStream.method436();// The item being displayed on the shop. skillCapes[i] + 2 in previous code.<br>
class9_1.inventoryValue[j22] = i25;<br>
}</p>
<pre><code>			for (int j25 = j19; j25 &lt; class9_1.inventory.length; j25++) {
				class9_1.inventory[j25] = 0;
				class9_1.inventoryValue[j25] = 0;
			}
			pktType = -1;
			return true;[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see here, for every byte, string, int, etc being sent, there is something on the client reading it. That’s what you need to verify in your server.</p>
<p>I’d look at player updating and the data sent on first login, as those will be where your issue is.</p>
