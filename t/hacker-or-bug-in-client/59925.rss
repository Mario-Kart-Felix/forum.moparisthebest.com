    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hacker-or-bug-in-client/59925</link>
    <description>is there any way that ur client can mess with the server? some1 signed on my server and called me a noob so i kicked him and he signed back on and said &quot;try this&quot; then crached my server, he was standing right in front of me, didnt have nething around to click on, like in the middle of wildy so it wasnt an object. then he just did it 2 more times b4 he left, i have to reopen the server each time, then later he signed on kicked me and signed on my name then changed the pass, how would he be doing these things?</description>
