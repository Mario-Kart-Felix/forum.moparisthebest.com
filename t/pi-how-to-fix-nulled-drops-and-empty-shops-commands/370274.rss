    <description>[center][size=18pt][shadow=green,right][u][b]NPC Drop Reloader:[/b][/u][/shadow][/size][/center]
In Commands.java add the beginning of the command:

[code]			if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;reloaddrops&quot;) &amp;&amp; c.playerRights &gt;= 3) {
[/code]
This will make it an actual command in your server.
And the &#39;c.playerRights &gt;= 3) {&#39; part in your command will only allow players with the owner rank to do the command.

Next, add this right under what you&#39;ve just added:
[code]				Server.npcDrops = null;
				Server.npcDrops = new server.model.npcs.NPCDrops();
[/code]
&#39;Server.npcDrops = null;&#39; will tell the server to make no drops able in your server; just in case.
That&#39;s where &#39;Server.npcDrops = new server.model.npcs.NPCDROPS();&#39; comes in handy.
After your server makes all the drops nulled, that little section of the command will make all of them new again.

This part,
[code]for (int j = 0; j &lt; Server.playerHandler.players.length; j++) {
					if (Server.playerHandler.players[j] != null) {
						Client c2 = (Client)Server.playerHandler.players[j];[/code]
I&#39;ll sum this down, this is basically applying all the changes to every player online.

Under that add this:
[code]
						c2.sendMessage(&quot;[&quot; + c.playerName + &quot;] &quot; + &quot;NPC Drops have been reloaded.&quot;);
					}
				}

			}[/code]
This is to confirm that you&#39;ve done everything properly; like, for example, a typo, you wouldn&#39;t get this message if you had one.

You should get a command resulting like this:
[code]			if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;reloaddrops&quot;) &amp;&amp; c.playerRights &gt;= 3) {
				Server.npcDrops = null;
				Server.npcDrops = new server.model.npcs.NPCDrops();
				for (int j = 0; j &lt; Server.playerHandler.players.length; j++) {
					if (Server.playerHandler.players[j] != null) {
						Client c2 = (Client)Server.playerHandler.players[j];
						c2.sendMessage(&quot;[&quot; + c.playerName + &quot;] &quot; + &quot;NPC Drops have been reloaded.&quot;);
					}
				}

			}
[/code]

And nulled drops are bad, it makes it to where nobody can receive any drops on your server.
If he kills an NPC, a player, etc.
That&#39;s why this command will come in handy for those PI servers who don&#39;t have this fixed.

[center][size=18pt][shadow=green,right][u][b]Shop Reloader:[/b][/u][/shadow][/size][/center]
This will be simple, but in Commands.java add the beginning of this command:
[code]			if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;reloadshops&quot;) &amp;&amp; c.playerRights &gt;= 3) {
[/code]
&lt;blockquote&gt;This will make it an actual command in your server.
And the &#39;c.playerRights &gt;= 3) {&#39; part in your command will only allow players with the owner rank to do the command.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under that add this:
[code]				Server.shopHandler = new server.world.ShopHandler();
			}
[/code]
This will make it so that every shop gets reset, in other words, all the items get put back to their max quantity in every shop.

This command will be in good use eventually, because if you didn&#39;t use this command, then eventually your shops would run out of items.
Then all your players would get upset and complain; ain&#39;t that annoying?
But if you use this command, then that would never happen.
You could simply type &#39;::reloadshops&#39; and then your problem would be solved.</description>
