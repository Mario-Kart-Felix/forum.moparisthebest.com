    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/people-flood-attacking-with-pakcets/435729</link>
    <description>hey everyone i was wondering if you could help me out basically.  ok so i was wondering how to i guess it would be mirror packets away from the server that are marked as suspicious. many people use this to DOS a server and time it out so basically there cannot be any connections made.  So if you could guide how to (mark)know when someone is sending these packets to mirror them away or to completly disconnect the ip they are coming from. thanks alot for looking guys :D</description>

<p>Flag them however you please, then use MINA’s <a href="http://mina.apache.org/report/trunk/apidocs/org/apache/mina/filter/firewall/ConnectionThrottleFilter.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">ConnectionThrottleFilter</a><br>
[/quote]Using the ConnectionThrottleFilter just helps with people spamming connections, not actual packets once they’re connected.  Granted, you could override the proper method, but I don’t see why you would when you can decouple the two distinct filters.</p>
<p>Also, I believe that the version of MINA that is being used doesn’t have that class (or even package).<br>
[/quote]Given that you disconnect the player once they’re flagged, the throttle filter will take care of the rest…And yeah, I recall now I had to update MINA in order to implement it<br>
[/quote]That doesn’t address the issue of two different things being tightly coupled for no good reason.</p>
<p>The issue arises when someone breaks the threshold, and they’re IP banned even though they’ve done nothing.  But just disconnecting them can be abused to their advantage.  Also, IP banning someone for exceeding the threshold for some small interval isn’t really a sufficient deterrent to stop them from using it as a way to ‘x log’.<br>
[/quote]That all depends on how you decide to flag the person… and whether you have graduated levels of severity, ie. this person has already been disconnected 3 times, if you have a base time of 10 minutes, the player would be throttled for 30 min. Of course you want to write it in such a way that they’re only getting flagged for purposely packet spamming.</p>
<p>For the x-logging… when they get flagged the connection should end and the player should still remain logged in but given a standard time-out. And of course you’d restrict getting logged out while in combat.</p>
<p>And I don’t see your point about having “no good reason” for the two modules to be tightly coupled. It’s an important part of the server, given the culture… And personally I’d want to have a nice degree of interoperability between the throttle (or any other security related shit on the filter chain) and game engine…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Which is why there should be a service that deals with bans, so you can persist bans, ban for other reasons, and use it throughout the rest of the application.</p>
<p>Coupling the ‘packet spam detection’, and the ‘connection spam detection’ is silly.  Especially when you couple both of them directly with the  code that is actually doing the banning.</p>
<p>In short, it’s just not as flexible as it should be.<br>
[/quote]The system I proposed only requires it to be loosely coupled in the first place, since you can just keep some metrics (how many times they’ve packet spammed previously, packets per minute, packets per some given time frame, number of packets malformed in a given time frame, etc.) and the filter will only be dependent on that data - which the game engine will be keeping track of and using for its own purposes anyway. The point being, accurate detection of packet spammers instead of just a “blind” approach. Once they’ve been identified, disconnected, and throttled- the attack is not a threat anymore.</p>
<p>I don’t see a need for another service when the throttle filter really doesn’t have to be complex at all to to be very powerful. It’s going to use a map anyway, which saves the added complexity of querying another service.<br>
[/quote]This doesn’t deal with persisting bans for constant offenders, or bans for any reason.  With your system, it will require multiple ‘systems’ for banning, this is just silly.</p>
<p>I didn’t mean service as a separate application or anything like that, I meant it as something that just performs a certain task; like when you pay someone to provide a service to you.  Here is an example:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/Lothy/MoparClassic/blob/pre-beta/GameServer/src/org/moparscape/msc/gs/connection/filter/IPBanManager.scala" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/Lothy/MoparClassic/blob/pre-beta/GameServer/src/org/moparscape/msc/gs/connection/filter/IPBanManager.scala</a></p>
<p>Sorry that it’s not in Java, but you should be able to understand what’s going on.</p>
<p>It’s simple, decoupled, and flexible.  Note: In Scala you can define multiple classes (public/private/etc.) within the same file, so it’s not as tightly coupled as it would be considered if it were in Java.  Also, it has some things that weren’t cleanly re-factored (mainly the idea of having a Blocker trait).<br>
[/quote]It doesn’t need to persist bans for other reasons - the db has this information. A user being throttled is not equivalent to being banned.<br>
[/quote]Yes it is…  It’s a temporary ban.<br>
[/quote]Which is accomplished by throttling the user, no?<br>
I do see your point though, your approach is definitely better design wise. But I think functionally if you have your throttle filter implementation as the second (or first if you’re not using the <a href="http://mina.apache.org/report/trunk/apidocs/org/apache/mina/filter/firewall/BlacklistFilter.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">BlackListFilter</a>) filter in your filter chain it’s better than having to process anything other than a check for the address/subnet in the map.[/quote]<br>
All types of banning/throttling should be represented the same way to the BlackListFilter.  This makes the logic a lot easier, and makes sense, because a ban is a ban.  No matter if it’s very short (throttled), temp (a few hours/days), or perm.</p>
<p>This is all that is needed to be done to check if someone is throttled/temp banned/banned is this:<br>
if (IPBanManager.isBlocked(host))</p>
<p>That is a lot simpler (in terms of LOC and speed) than keeping three collections, checking them, and dealing with the logic inside the BlackListFilter.</p>
<p>The connection filter (ConnectionFilter) is a BlackListFilter, and it is first.  After that is the PacketThrottler.</p>
<p><code>acceptor.getFilterChain().addFirst("packetthrottler", PacketThrottler.getInstance()); // Added as first.
acceptor.getFilterChain().addFirst("connectionfilter", new ConnectionFilter()); // Now it's added as first, which makes packetthrottler second.
</code></p>

<p>And I don’t see your point about having “no good reason” for the two modules to be tightly coupled. It’s an important part of the server, given the culture… And personally I’d want to have a nice degree of interoperability between the throttle (or any other security related shit on the filter chain) and game engine…</p>

<p>Which is why there should be a service that deals with bans, so you can persist bans, ban for other reasons, and use it throughout the rest of the application.</p>
<p>Coupling the ‘packet spam detection’, and the ‘connection spam detection’ is silly.  Especially when you couple both of them directly with the  code that is actually doing the banning.</p>
<p>In short, it’s just not as flexible as it should be.<br>
[/quote]The system I proposed only requires it to be loosely coupled in the first place, since you can just keep some metrics (how many times they’ve packet spammed previously, packets per minute, packets per some given time frame, number of packets malformed in a given time frame, etc.) and the filter will only be dependent on that data - which the game engine will be keeping track of and using for its own purposes anyway. The point being, accurate detection of packet spammers instead of just a “blind” approach. Once they’ve been identified, disconnected, and throttled- the attack is not a threat anymore.</p>
<p>I don’t see a need for another service when the throttle filter really doesn’t have to be complex at all to to be very powerful. It’s going to use a map anyway, which saves the added complexity of querying another service.[/quote]This doesn’t deal with persisting bans for constant offenders, or bans for any reason.  With your system, it will require multiple ‘systems’ for banning, this is just silly.</p>
<p>I didn’t mean service as a separate application or anything like that, I meant it as something that just performs a certain task; like when you pay someone to provide a service to you.  Here is an example:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/Lothy/MoparClassic/blob/pre-beta/GameServer/src/org/moparscape/msc/gs/connection/filter/IPBanManager.scala" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/Lothy/MoparClassic/blob/pre-beta/GameServer/src/org/moparscape/msc/gs/connection/filter/IPBanManager.scala</a></p>
<p>Sorry that it’s not in Java, but you should be able to understand what’s going on.</p>
<p>It’s simple, decoupled, and flexible.  Note: In Scala you can define multiple classes (public/private/etc.) within the same file, so it’s not as tightly coupled as it would be considered if it were in Java.  Also, it has some things that weren’t cleanly re-factored (mainly the idea of having a Blocker trait).</p>

Flag them however you please, then use MINA’s <a href="http://mina.apache.org/report/trunk/apidocs/org/apache/mina/filter/firewall/ConnectionThrottleFilter.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">ConnectionThrottleFilter</a><br>
[/quote]Using the ConnectionThrottleFilter just helps with people spamming connections, not actual packets once they’re connected.  Granted, you could override the proper method, but I don’t see why you would when you can decouple the two distinct filters.</p>
<p>Also, I believe that the version of MINA that is being used doesn’t have that class (or even package).<br>
[/quote]Given that you disconnect the player once they’re flagged, the throttle filter will take care of the rest…And yeah, I recall now I had to update MINA in order to implement it<br>
[/quote]That doesn’t address the issue of two different things being tightly coupled for no good reason.</p>
<p>The issue arises when someone breaks the threshold, and they’re IP banned even though they’ve done nothing.  But just disconnecting them can be abused to their advantage.  Also, IP banning someone for exceeding the threshold for some small interval isn’t really a sufficient deterrent to stop them from using it as a way to ‘x log’.<br>
[/quote]That all depends on how you decide to flag the person… and whether you have graduated levels of severity, ie. this person has already been disconnected 3 times, if you have a base time of 10 minutes, the player would be throttled for 30 min. Of course you want to write it in such a way that they’re only getting flagged for purposely packet spamming.</p>

              <p>hey everyone i was wondering if you could help me out basically.  ok so i was wondering how to i guess it would be mirror packets away from the server that are marked as suspicious. many people use this to DOS a server and time it out so basically there cannot be any connections made.  So if you could guide how to (mark)know when someone is sending these packets to mirror them away or to completly disconnect the ip they are coming from. thanks alot for looking guys <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
