    <title>Julius Caesar</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/julius-caesar/62350</link>
    <description>Sup mates,

Obviously I need some help, lol. Anyway, what I need is a reference to a site or some other source of information that has most, if not all, of the quotes from Shakespeare&#39;s play[i]Julius Caesar[/i], which I need to have. Those quotes are listed below. The reference needs to have a description of what the quote mean too. I&#39;ve been looking around, but haven&#39;t had any luck finding good sites.

What I need:
1) Has at least 5 of the quotes listed below from Shakespeare&#39;s [i]Julius Caesar[/i].
2) Description of quote.
3) If possible, significance of the quote. - &quot;How does it relate to the rest of the play?&quot;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Beware the Ides of March. (I.ii,18)

Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look. He thinks too much, such men are dangerous. (I.ii,194-195)

For I believe they are portentous things. 
Unto the climate that they point upon. (I.iii,31-32)

No, not an oath. (II.i,114)

Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius. (II.i,166)

Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out, “Help, ho! They murder Caesar!” (II.ii,2-3)

And so near will I be,
That your best friends shall wish I had been further. (II.ii,123-124)

If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live; If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive. (II.iii,15-16)

I have a man’s mind, but a woman’s might. (II.iv,73)

Trebonius knows his time, for look you, Brutus. He draws Mark Antony out of the way. (III.i,24-25)

Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead! (III.i,78)

You know not what you do; do not consent. That Antony speak in his funeral. (III.i,231-232)

Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more. (III.ii,22-23)

Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears. (III.ii,78)

Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, 
And Brutus is an honorable man. (III.ii,87-88)

These many then shall die, their names are pricked. (IV.i,1)

Do not talk of him, But as a property. (IV.i,39-40)

But it sufficeth that the day will end,
And then the end is known. (V.i,125-126)

Caesar, thou art revenged,
Even with the sword that killed thee. (V.iii,45-46)

O Julius Caesar, thou are mighty yet! (V.iii,94)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thanks,
Leader</description>
