    <title>[MUST READ]How to make your server good[MUST READ]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/must-read-how-to-make-your-server-good-must-read/453184</link>
    <description>There&#39;s starting to be quite alot of tuts on how to do this, but I want to make one too!
I&#39;ll try to get into as many aspects as possible


1. Staff
Quote:
New player: &quot;Can you help me admin?&quot;
Admin: &quot;GTFO!!!&quot;
That&#39;s NOT how that conversation should look!
Try to pick your staff carefully, instead of choosing random people or selling staff!!!
The staff you&#39;re looking for is:
Willing to help new players, and punish rule-breakers!
Willing to participate in events, without ruining them (for example by using an admin item to PK)
Willing to socialize with the players, without giving them free stuff/staff!
The more careful you are when choosing staff, the more likely the conversation will end up looking like this:
Quote:
New player: &quot;Can you help me admin?&quot;
Admin: &quot;Sure, what do you need help with?&quot;
Then, the new player will be happy, and will be more likely to stay!

2. Economy
This one is a HUGE problem on MANY servers!
You DON&#39;T want each player to trade 100 AGS&#39;S for 50 billions each!
But, how do you PREVENT that?
Just follow these simple steps:
1. Money sinks!
You most likely have ways for players to EARN money!
But, they also need ways to LOSE them again!
By removing all the bones from shops, and forcing players to buy them of other players or kill monsters, they&#39;ll spend a quite large amount of money to reach 99 prayer (specially if you make the bones giving a fair amount of XP, without making them give too much) Also, make sure that YOUR monsters 100% drops are the same as the same monster on runescape!
By doing that ALONE, you&#39;ll most likely remove HUGE amounts of cash from the server every day (And, that&#39;s a good thing!)
Do the same for alot of other skills!
Don&#39;t add too good items in shops either!
2. Anti-dupes!
Most people don&#39;t know this, but anti-dupes ain&#39;t difficult to make!
You just have to know how to perform the dupe!
For example, the &quot;Offer X&quot; dupe that&#39;s been around (Idk if it&#39;s also on PI)
Fixing that is simple: Just make the server remember what item from what slot you put on the trade last! If it is the same as the last one you put up, make it just... Do nothing!
Dupe fixed!
Economy improved!
3. Make people WORK for their items
The good items will be worthless if you can just buy them in a shop, or kill a goblin to get them!
Soloution: MAKE PLAYERS WORK FOR THEIR ITEMS!
Make NPCs drop something that would be logical for their level!
Remove potions/food/bows/runes from shops, and make people have to kill monsters/skill for above items! (You may have some secondary ingredients for pots in shops tho)
4. Quests!
On many servers, quest rewards are wrecking the economy!
DON&#39;T make Cook&#39;s Assistant give 500 millions upon completion!
Give quests a logical reward!
Cook&#39;s Assistant should give some cooking XP, maybe a little cash, and (possibly) a little raw food!
5. Thieving!
Here&#39;s another of the common economy killers!
Your level 1 stall AIN&#39;T supposed to give one million!
It&#39;s supposed to be around... 800 GP to 5K
The final stall should give... 20-22K I presume!
You might also make a &quot;Failing Chance&quot;
So, that a player will be forced into combat, damaged in another way or put inside some kind of &quot;jail&quot; upon failing! (To prevent thieving bots!)


3. Stability!
Who wants to play your server if it nulls/crashes every 10 second?
Answer: NOBODY!
So, do your best to shorten your code!
Improving already existing code (if not using an empty base), and do whatever you can to test it (even test it with several accounts logged in, if possible!)
Trust me: You&#39;ll find TONS of bugs that will null/crash your server (or cause other bad effects)

4. Difference!
Why would a player choose to play YOUR server, if all you&#39;ve done is DL a PI, and change the name?
They wouldn&#39;t, because your server is worse than or exactly the same as 85% of the servers out there!
What you shall do is: Code something original(or hire someone to do it for you, if you doesn&#39;t know how to code)
Preferably use a rarely used base, and, use that rarely used base, for something that other people who use it doesn&#39;t (I use Devolution 7.0, but doesn&#39;t code a Dodian Remake!)

5. Player Priorities!
If you let players vote for what updates they want, then this is EXTREMELY important!
Let&#39;s say that this is the voting/results
Update 1
3522 votes
Update 2
8 votes
Update 3
366 votes
Update 4
92 votes

Then, you should make Update 1 (even tho YOU would like Update 2 better)
The normal players welfare is your highest priority
You shall NOT make an update, that YOU would like, if your players WON&#39;T like it!
The customer is ALWAYS right!

6. Patience!
This is most likely the most IMPORTANT of them all!
If you doesn&#39;t have the patience to create the server, it will end up failed!
Also, don&#39;t rush towards the release date...
Do as I do... just take it a little of a time...
That way the coding will be much better!
The economy will be much better!
The staff will be much better!
Anything else will be much better!
So, remember: The more time you spend, the better the server will end
Another thing you shall be patient with is Bug Fixing...
My around 4 years of rsps coding experience taught me: THE CODE NEVER WORKS THE FIRST TIME!
So, you have to try, try and try again!
I almost always try to fix something for ATLEAST 1 week before requesting help with it!

7. Choosing staff
As explained in the first part of this tut, you have to choose your staff CAREFULLY!
You have to be EXTREMELY strict when choosing your staff (breaking even the smallest rule, decreases the chance by alot)
They also have to prove helpful to the other players... And, that&#39;s just when you&#39;re choosing MODS
Admins must be people who actually WORKED on creating the server (website developers, serverside coders, clientside coders, hosters and such)
Co owner(if there is such) must be whoever you STARTED your project with!
NOBODY ELSE WILL EVER GET IT!

8. Activity
Your players won&#39;t like you, if you and your staff never is on!
Try to be an active player, along with the staff member you also are!
Socialize with the players, and help them when they need it!
If you/your other staff for some reason ain&#39;t able to be active ingame, you can make your best mod, an &quot;admin in charge of socializing&quot;
That will increase the chance of players staying on YOUR server several times!

9. Balancing
I know that alot of servers are PK servers, and that&#39;s okay but, what about the people who prefer to do other stuff than PK?
They would try to find a server that fits their needs better!
You can prevent that by balancing your server.
Balancing is done by focusing equally at these things when coding them

PKing
Monster killing
Minigames
Quests
Skills
Anything else you might have on your server

If you focus equally on those (and you code them all well) more people will prefer YOUR server!

          <blockquote>
              <p>There’s starting to be quite alot of tuts on how to do this, but I want to make one too!<br>
I’ll try to get into as many aspects as possible</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Staff<br>
Quote:<br>
New player: “Can you help me admin?”<br>
Admin: “GTFO!!!”<br>
That’s NOT how that conversation should look!<br>
Try to pick your staff carefully, instead of choosing random people or selling staff!!!<br>
The staff you’re looking for is:<br>
Willing to help new players, and punish rule-breakers!<br>
Willing to participate in events, without ruining them (for example by using an admin item to PK)<br>
Willing to socialize with the players, without giving them free stuff/staff!<br>
The more careful you are when choosing staff, the more likely the conversation will end up looking like this:<br>
Quote:<br>
New player: “Can you help me admin?”<br>
Admin: “Sure, what do you need help with?”<br>
Then, the new player will be happy, and will be more likely to stay!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Economy<br>
This one is a HUGE problem on MANY servers!<br>
You DON’T want each player to trade 100 AGS’S for 50 billions each!<br>
But, how do you PREVENT that?<br>
Just follow these simple steps:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Money sinks!<br>
You most likely have ways for players to EARN money!<br>
But, they also need ways to LOSE them again!<br>
By removing all the bones from shops, and forcing players to buy them of other players or kill monsters, they’ll spend a quite large amount of money to reach 99 prayer (specially if you make the bones giving a fair amount of XP, without making them give too much) Also, make sure that YOUR monsters 100% drops are the same as the same monster on runescape!<br>
By doing that ALONE, you’ll most likely remove HUGE amounts of cash from the server every day (And, that’s a good thing!)<br>
Do the same for alot of other skills!<br>
Don’t add too good items in shops either!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anti-dupes!<br>
Most people don’t know this, but anti-dupes ain’t difficult to make!<br>
You just have to know how to perform the dupe!<br>
For example, the “Offer X” dupe that’s been around (Idk if it’s also on PI)<br>
Fixing that is simple: Just make the server remember what item from what slot you put on the trade last! If it is the same as the last one you put up, make it just… Do nothing!<br>
Dupe fixed!<br>
Economy improved!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make people WORK for their items<br>
The good items will be worthless if you can just buy them in a shop, or kill a goblin to get them!<br>
Soloution: MAKE PLAYERS WORK FOR THEIR ITEMS!<br>
Make NPCs drop something that would be logical for their level!<br>
Remove potions/food/bows/runes from shops, and make people have to kill monsters/skill for above items! (You may have some secondary ingredients for pots in shops tho)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quests!<br>
On many servers, quest rewards are wrecking the economy!<br>
DON’T make Cook’s Assistant give 500 millions upon completion!<br>
Give quests a logical reward!<br>
Cook’s Assistant should give some cooking XP, maybe a little cash, and (possibly) a little raw food!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thieving!<br>
Here’s another of the common economy killers!<br>
Your level 1 stall AIN’T supposed to give one million!<br>
It’s supposed to be around… 800 GP to 5K<br>
The final stall should give… 20-22K I presume!<br>
You might also make a “Failing Chance”<br>
So, that a player will be forced into combat, damaged in another way or put inside some kind of “jail” upon failing! (To prevent thieving bots!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stability!<br>
Who wants to play your server if it nulls/crashes every 10 second?<br>
Answer: NOBODY!<br>
So, do your best to shorten your code!<br>
Improving already existing code (if not using an empty base), and do whatever you can to test it (even test it with several accounts logged in, if possible!)<br>
Trust me: You’ll find TONS of bugs that will null/crash your server (or cause other bad effects)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Difference!<br>
Why would a player choose to play YOUR server, if all you’ve done is DL a PI, and change the name?<br>
They wouldn’t, because your server is worse than or exactly the same as 85% of the servers out there!<br>
What you shall do is: Code something original(or hire someone to do it for you, if you doesn’t know how to code)<br>
Preferably use a rarely used base, and, use that rarely used base, for something that other people who use it doesn’t (I use Devolution 7.0, but doesn’t code a Dodian Remake!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Player Priorities!<br>
If you let players vote for what updates they want, then this is EXTREMELY important!<br>
Let’s say that this is the voting/results<br>
Update 1<br>
3522 votes<br>
Update 2<br>
8 votes<br>
Update 3<br>
366 votes<br>
Update 4<br>
92 votes</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Then, you should make Update 1 (even tho YOU would like Update 2 better)<br>
The normal players welfare is your highest priority<br>
You shall NOT make an update, that YOU would like, if your players WON’T like it!<br>
The customer is ALWAYS right!</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<p>Patience!<br>
This is most likely the most IMPORTANT of them all!<br>
If you doesn’t have the patience to create the server, it will end up failed!<br>
Also, don’t rush towards the release date…<br>
Do as I do… just take it a little of a time…<br>
That way the coding will be much better!<br>
The economy will be much better!<br>
The staff will be much better!<br>
Anything else will be much better!<br>
So, remember: The more time you spend, the better the server will end<br>
Another thing you shall be patient with is Bug Fixing…<br>
My around 4 years of rsps coding experience taught me: THE CODE NEVER WORKS THE FIRST TIME!<br>
So, you have to try, try and try again!<br>
I almost always try to fix something for ATLEAST 1 week before requesting help with it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choosing staff<br>
As explained in the first part of this tut, you have to choose your staff CAREFULLY!<br>
You have to be EXTREMELY strict when choosing your staff (breaking even the smallest rule, decreases the chance by alot)<br>
They also have to prove helpful to the other players… And, that’s just when you’re choosing MODS<br>
Admins must be people who actually WORKED on creating the server (website developers, serverside coders, clientside coders, hosters and such)<br>
Co owner(if there is such) must be whoever you STARTED your project with!<br>
NOBODY ELSE WILL EVER GET IT!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Activity<br>
Your players won’t like you, if you and your staff never is on!<br>
Try to be an active player, along with the staff member you also are!<br>
Socialize with the players, and help them when they need it!<br>
If you/your other staff for some reason ain’t able to be active ingame, you can make your best mod, an “admin in charge of socializing”<br>
That will increase the chance of players staying on YOUR server several times!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Balancing<br>
I know that alot of servers are PK servers, and that’s okay but, what about the people who prefer to do other stuff than PK?<br>
They would try to find a server that fits their needs better!<br>
You can prevent that by balancing your server.<br>
Balancing is done by focusing equally at these things when coding them</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>PKing<br>
Monster killing<br>
Minigames<br>
Quests<br>
Skills<br>
Anything else you might have on your server</p>
<p>If you focus equally on those (and you code them all well) more people will prefer YOUR server!</p>
<p>Post below if there’s something I forgot to add!</p>
