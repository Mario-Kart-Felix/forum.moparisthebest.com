    <description>Okay this is how you do this on windows XP

Now this may sound stupid, but it may help for those people who get constantly grounded like me =P
First you need access to an administrator account so this is the hard part, you just have to wait for your parents to leave the computer on or something so you can get on for about 1 minute. (one way i reccomend is tell them you need to research for homework or something and actually research but do this at the same time)

If you somehow get access to the computer administrator account, Go to start&gt;run.  This should bring up a little window where you need to type in &quot;cmd&quot; (with no quotations).. It will bring up the command box where you will type this:
[code]net user[/code]

It will bring up a list of all of the accounts on your PC.  after you type that, type this:
[code]net user (name of user you want to change the password to)*[/code]
So if the persons name was bill you would put:
[code] net user bill *[/code]
Make sure you put a space in between the persons name and the *




Okay now if you cant get onto an administrator account, theres another way to do this (this way is reccomended even if you can get on an admin account, but all credits go to jonckr)

Boot up in safe mode.
Then you want to log in as the account &quot;Administrator&quot;
Do the same steps as earlier, or use the admin account to delete the password, or change the password.

Hope this helps you desperate little folks out there :P</description>

              <p>Okay this is how you do this on windows XP</p>
<p>Now this may sound stupid, but it may help for those people who get constantly grounded like me =P<br>
First you need access to an administrator account so this is the hard part, you just have to wait for your parents to leave the computer on or something so you can get on for about 1 minute. (one way i reccomend is tell them you need to research for homework or something and actually research but do this at the same time)</p>
<p>If you somehow get access to the computer administrator account, Go to start&gt;run.  This should bring up a little window where you need to type in “cmd” (with no quotations)… It will bring up the command box where you will type this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">net user</code></pre>
<p>It will bring up a list of all of the accounts on your PC.  after you type that, type this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">net user (name of user you want to change the password to)*</code></pre>
<p>So if the persons name was bill you would put:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"> net user bill *</code></pre>
<p>Make sure you put a space in between the persons name and the *</p>
<p>Okay now if you cant get onto an administrator account, theres another way to do this (this way is reccomended even if you can get on an admin account, but all credits go to jonckr)</p>
<p>Boot up in safe mode.<br>
Then you want to log in as the account “Administrator”<br>
Do the same steps as earlier, or use the admin account to delete the password, or change the password.</p>
<p>Hope this helps you desperate little folks out there <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
