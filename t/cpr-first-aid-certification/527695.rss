    <title>CPR/First Aid certification</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cpr-first-aid-certification/527695</link>
    <description>Was eating some chips earlier when I nearly choked on a Doritos and it reminded me that I used to be certified.(Thankfully I caught it just in time before it got caught in my throat and was able to force it back out lol)

I haven&#39;t been certified in either one for a good two years now. As a few of you know I am somewhat tight on money so I&#39;d much rather find a &quot;free&quot; place to get re-certified if at all possible. I remember hearing a while back about a few places but I can&#39;t remember the names of them now. I might even consider putting $10 or something into it. 

So yeah I would like to get re-certified. If anybody knows of a place that does anything relative to this for a cheap/free free please list them below. Please note it would have to be done either online ( if possible? ), or in the state of Georgia, USA.</description>

The fee where I live was around 200$ for the full senior first aid certificate and the company I work for were able to fully reimburse the cost. You can also claim the fee on tax (that may also depend on where you live, I’m not sure how American tax works in these situations).</p>

The classes are 100% for people to run, which is why I never understood the fees.  Usually, the only thing you have to pay for is the physical CPR card.  Fire departments are a good one to check, because I know at least 3 people at my department that are certified to teach CPR, and are always more than willing to hold a free class.</p>

              <p>Was eating some chips earlier when I nearly choked on a Doritos and it reminded me that I used to be certified.(Thankfully I caught it just in time before it got caught in my throat and was able to force it back out lol)</p>
<p>I haven’t been certified in either one for a good two years now. As a few of you know I am somewhat tight on money so I’d much rather find a “free” place to get re-certified if at all possible. I remember hearing a while back about a few places but I can’t remember the names of them now. I might even consider putting $10 or something into it.</p>
<p>So yeah I would like to get re-certified. If anybody knows of a place that does anything relative to this for a cheap/free free please list them below. Please note it would have to be done either online ( if possible? ), or in the state of Georgia, USA.</p>
