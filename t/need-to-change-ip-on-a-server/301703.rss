              <p>Lol…A server, When you Run it, Will automaticly Run on your ip…<br>
IF you mean a Client, As in you open it and it Loads the loading screen thingy…<br>
Goto “EGUI.Java” or “GUI.Java”, If you dont have ether Right click on what you click to open it<br>
And press “edit” and it should look something like:<br>
<a class="mention" href="/u/echo">@Echo</a> off<br>
java -Xmx500 .;theme.jar EGUI.java<br>
Or something along those lines<br>
Look for after .;theme.jar and you will see “EGUI.java” that is what It loads<br>
Then open “EGUI.Java”,or whatever it says, And you should see A bunch of numbers at the bottom<br>
EX:<br>
127.0.0.1, 546.265.168.124<em>random ip btw</em>, Or watever with a bunch of dots, Or you may see<br>
blahblah.no-ip.biz…Just change those numbers (or letters) To your ip…<br>
Get your IP from <a href="http://www.whatsmyip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">www.whatsmyip.org</a>…OR if you have a no-ip Just put it there<br>
Hit “Compile” or “compilier” and Your done</p>

              <p>as in?</p>
<p>if your using a custom client and your new to coding… maybe you should start out with a glitchy server and slowly learn how to fix the glitches. (figmentscape) but that’s imo.</p>
<p>if your talking about changing the “ip” of the server… you must go to <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a> login etc… and make a new host</p>
<p>then if you have already downloaded no-ip go to it and check the new ip and uncheck the other one.</p>
<p>is that right?</p>
