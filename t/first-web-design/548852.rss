    <description>Hey guys, so I made this yesterday and I think it looks nice. You have to remember this is my first one so it isn&#39;t going to be spectacular. I am using this template to practice on and try new things such as drop-down menus and such.. Me and my friend (the person who mentored me through learning HTML and CSS) are going to start a mini web development business so I need some feedback on what I need to improve on. This site has no specific theme so I just put random words for the navigation bar and the buttons under the picture, also with random words on it. So tell me what you think of my first web design :D
