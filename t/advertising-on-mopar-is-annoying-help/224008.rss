    <description>When I advertise on mopar server status it always says two things.

You only get one post, one server. (Even when i searched for my servers name and my other comp&#39;s)
Error Server is offline. Please turn it on to register it (But my server is up)

Someone should fix all of the bugs on the server status pages...[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 05, 2008, 06:13:33 pm[/size][hr]woops ok heres what happened...I checked again if it was on any lists. and it was on page 24...how do i take it off the list!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?</description>
