    <title>[Tutorial] Preventing hunger level from dropping in Bukkit</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tutorial-preventing-hunger-level-from-dropping-in-bukkit/547375</link>
    <description>A small tutorial I wrote earlier today, it may come in useful for anyone trying to create Bukkit plugins :)

https://www.jamesmonger.com/post/preventing-hunger-level-from-dropping-in-bukkit.html

&lt;blockquote&gt;Being able to control the player&#39;s hunger is a very useful tool in plugin development, for example if you want to make a plugin where the player focuses solely on combat without having to worry about their hunger. Luckily, it&#39;s also a very easy thing to implement.

You want to head into your event handler class and create a new method to listen for the player&#39;s hunger change. Call it what you wish, but it needs to take a FoodLevelChangeEvent argument. It also needs to be annotated with @EventHandler.

[code=Java]@EventHandler
public void playerHungerChange(FoodLevelChangeEvent e) {

}[/code]

Now, we need to check that the hunger level is dropping and not increasing because both of these are handled by the FoodLevelChangeEvent event. Make a Player object using the event&#39;s Entity.

[code=Java]Player p = (Player) e.getEntity();[/code]

Store two integers, one called before and one after. These will store the food level before the event and the food level after the event, respectively. To get the food level before the event, we will get the food level of the player, and to get the food level after the event we will get the food level of the event.

[code=Java]int before = p.getFoodLevel();
int after = e.getFoodLevel();[/code]

The last part of this guide is very simple. We check if before is bigger than after and, if so, cancel the event. This ensures that the event is only cancelled if the hunger is dropping - we don&#39;t want to stop players from being able to eat!

[code=Java]if (before &gt; after) {
    e.setCancelled(true);
}[/code]

That&#39;s it! Build your plugin and reload your server and your player&#39;s hungers will not drop! If you want to add more conditions to the hunger dropping, such as only preventing the drop if the player has a certain position, place this inside the if-statement checking that it&#39;s dropping.
