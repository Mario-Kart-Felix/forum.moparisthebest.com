    <description>I&#39;m working on a lotto program and am basically done with it.

I am supposed to generate 5000 sets of 5 numbers, 4 regular and 1 Powerball. After that, I generate a separate set of numbers to see if 3 of the 5 numbers in the new set match up to 3 of the numbers from the first 5000 sets of generated numbers. If not, another separate set is generated. This happens until the separate set generated has 3 matches with one of the original 5000 sets. Right now, I am checking not only the numbers generated, but also their location (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th).

If one of my original 5000 sets looks like:

1 2 3 8 9,

..and the new set generated is:

6 2 3 1 7,

the macro does not see that as a &quot;match&quot;, even though the numbers 1, 2, and 3 are in both sets.

Any help or nudge in the right direction would be appreciated. I know there are probably more efficient ways to do many of the things that I&#39;ve done in my code, but programming is new to me, so I&#39;m still in a learning process and do not care much for efficiency at the moment.

NOTE: The Powerball number can be viewed as a regular number, it does not have to be chosen separately, for the sake of this assignment.

This is the module that needs to be &quot;fixed&quot;

[code=Visual Basic]
Sub Match3Nums()

&#39;declaring variables for the 5 numbers to be chosen

Dim myNum1 As Integer, myNum2 As Integer, myNum3 As Integer, myNum4 As Integer, myNum5 As Integer
Dim match As Integer
Dim j As Integer, i As Integer

i = 0
match = 0

While match = 0

    i = i + 1

    myNum1 = Application.WorksheetFunction.RandBetween(1, 34)

anotherNum2:
    myNum2 = Application.WorksheetFunction.RandBetween(1, 34)
    If myNum1 = myNum2 Then GoTo anotherNum2

anotherNum3:
    myNum3 = Application.WorksheetFunction.RandBetween(1, 34)
    If myNum3 = myNum1 Or myNum3 = myNum2 Then GoTo anotherNum3

anotherNum4:
    myNum4 = Application.WorksheetFunction.RandBetween(1, 34)
    If myNum4 = myNum1 Or myNum4 = myNum2 Or myNum4 = myNum3 Then GoTo anotherNum4

    myNum5 = Application.WorksheetFunction.RandBetween(1, 10)

    Call Sort4(myNum1, myNum2, myNum3, myNum4)

    Sheets(&quot;Winner&quot;).Select
    Range(&quot;H3&quot;) = fnlPick1
    Range(&quot;I3&quot;) = fnlPick2
    Range(&quot;J3&quot;) = fnlPick3
    Range(&quot;K3&quot;) = fnlPick4
    Range(&quot;L3&quot;) = myNum5

    For j = 1 To 5000
        If (fnlPick1 = Range(&quot;B&quot; &amp; (j + 1)) And fnlPick2 = Range(&quot;C&quot; &amp; (j + 1)) And fnlPick3 = Range(&quot;D&quot; &amp; (j + 1))) _

            Then
            match = 1
        End If
    Next j

Wend

If i &gt; 1 Then
    MsgBox (&quot;It took &quot; &amp; i &amp; &quot; draws of the Winning Numbers to have 3 of the winning numbers match 3 of yours!&quot;)
        Else
    MsgBox (&quot;It took 1 draw of the Winning Numbers to have 3 of the winning numbers match 3 of yours! &quot; &amp; j &amp; &quot;&quot;)
End If

End Sub

Thanks for any assistance.</description>

              <p>You’ll need to use loops. Lots and lots of loops. For the current set you are checking, loop through each number in that set. Loop through each of the 5000 sets, and for each set you are checking against loop through each number.  If the numbers match, increase a counter and when it equals 3 break  out of the loop as far as needed. Will take 3 nested loops for this method</p>
