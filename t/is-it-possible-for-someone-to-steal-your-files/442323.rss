    <title>Is it possible for someone to steal your files?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-it-possible-for-someone-to-steal-your-files/442323</link>
    <description>After an argument with one of my ex members on my RSPS, he DoSed it, and I just figured out how to get it up again, and he says he stole my source files. Yes he did have Admininstrator Status, but I still do not believe him. I do not believe him because before he DoSed it, I gave my password to his irl friend who was my friend. And I think his friend gave him my password, and did &quot;GiveAdmin&quot; to his account. So is it possible that he has my files? If so, how do I prevent him from making updates to my server? And he also plans on DoSing my server again, any way of possibly defending my server again&#39;st the DoS?</description>

<p>Stealing implies the deprivation of whatever is being stolen. For example, when somebody steals your pink fuzzy slippers, they are depriving you of them.</p>
<p>I’m not saying it’s right, but it’s really just the unauthorized possession of property.</p>
<p>Also, doing an in-game command should not give anyone access to the machine. Unless he knew the machine password, or you were sharing the source (dropbox, etc) then he can’t have the source.[/quote]<br>
In other words, it would be considered copyright infringement, but in all honesty this is stolen code from Jagex anyways.</p>

              <p>Yes.</p>
<p>Although technically it isn’t stealing, because stealing implies the removal of the original copy.</p>
<p>For example, if someone stole your pink fuzzy slippers, then you wouldn’t have them anymore. But if someone copied them, then you’d still have a pair, and they would as well.</p>
