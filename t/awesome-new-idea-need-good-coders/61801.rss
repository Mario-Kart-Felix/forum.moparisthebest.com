    <title>Awesome New Idea, Need good coders</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/awesome-new-idea-need-good-coders/61801</link>
    <description>OK, First, this is not for noob coders. this is for expert coders. Here&#39;s my Idea:

Replace the Summon List With an Actual Music List.

now this music list is not the music list that&#39;s already on runescape. THIS Music list is for YOUR music. LIke lets say you like Panic! at the disco, but it&#39;s better if you do. instead of the summon list saying &quot;GOblin (level1) and such it would say &quot;But It&#39;s Better If You Do&quot;. so basically it&#39;s very similiar to the mopar music player, but this one will be in the game.

My Thought process is this:

1. Completely get rid of summoning and make that you music player, or replace that useless tab next to the friends tab with the music list.

2. Fix the case 185 stuff to make it so when you click on the Song Name name, it plays that song.

3. Make a Music.java file, and make a way to upload the music from it.

im thinking that the easiest music file format to use would be mp3.

Well, that&#39;s my proposition and if your interested,post and hopefull it will be a great tutorial when it&#39;s finished.</description>

<p>1. The music would have to be hosted clientside. 2. Mp3s would take awile to load the client everytime, jagex can take awile and they only use midis. 3. You would have to match the client to the server perfectly for the music to play i.e. file name and directory otherwise they’d risk crashing their client. And finally it’d be your choice of music not theirs as you would have to make the client, and tell the computer what to host. EnurScape comes with a nice mp3 player, as well as with the original runescape songs.</p>

<p>true it would be extremely hard…not the coding part but keeping people on due to massive lagg caused by it</p>
