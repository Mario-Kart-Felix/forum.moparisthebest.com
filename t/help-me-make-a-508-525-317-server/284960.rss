    <description>make a client-

ok well i disparate for a rs2 508/317/525 server, i seriously don&#39;t give a shit lol!
so i was wondering if anybody is willing to create a server with me, or i can be co owner or something like that or they can make a server and they can co owner it since they already have a server that they are owning.
so please just help me, im not offering any money or nothing, but if anyone if generous enough to do this...so be it...

if anyone accepts this can they please tell me on this topic/pm, i would be so greatful.
i am preety well into it, but i might run the server and it will come up and say &quot;the path cannot be specified&quot;, the ip changer clients i do it and it will load but it will stop on connecting to server and on the black square screen that pops up says like error on game or something.

i would like it from these files... thank you.
remember (if u help me with this you will be the owner def and ill be co :) vise versa. with the same rights.
