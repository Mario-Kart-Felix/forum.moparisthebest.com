              <p>You’ve posted a few Dev. Team threads in the past. Can’t imagine they’ve yielded any results due to the unprofessional layout. You provide very vague information, can’t imagine anyone with any actual developing experience wanting to apply. Half-ass threads only bring half-ass developers. It’s also scary to think how this reflects in your server work. My advice, make it look like a 9 year old didn’t create this; make people want to join your team who know what they’re doing. Luck</p>
