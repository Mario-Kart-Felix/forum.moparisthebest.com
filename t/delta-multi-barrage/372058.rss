    <title>Delta Multi-Barrage</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-multi-barrage/372058</link>
    <description>Hello, i have tried adding multi barrage a while back, but i gave up on it because it gave me errors, and i&#39;ve tried various tutorials, Can anybody link me to a multi barrage tutorial that they have actually tested and it works? becuase the ones i have found don&#39;t seem to work.

Appreciated,
