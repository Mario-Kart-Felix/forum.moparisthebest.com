    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-am-having-hamachi-download-problems-please-help/32326</link>
    <description>Ok. This is the story.
I have downloaded hamachi before and used it and have had no problem downloading and/or using it, until now. The last tiem I have done this, I tried to download hamachi on another computer. I worked. I clicked on Hamachi-Setup, so it would download Hamachi and run it. Thats where the problem came in. I clicked it and it said &quot;run&quot; or &quot;cancel&quot; I clicked run. Then it said &quot;Log ME into hamachi&quot; or szomehthing liek that. Then it said &quot;Hamachi version 1.0.1.2 has been detected on your computer. Would you like to proceed with an update? Yes or No&quot; i clicked yes and it upated and said &quot;Hamachi has successfully been updated&quot; So I did the same thing again, and it sdid the same thing. So it didn&#39;t work.

 Now today, I tried to log onto hamachi on this computer(not the other one which I had problems) like normal, and it just stayed at &quot;Logging in&quot; for 20mins straight. I closed it out and tried 3 diff times!! still didnt work, so being me , I unistalled and reinstalled. The same thing happened that happened to my other computer(listed at the top). I reinstalled and unistalled a coupple times and still doesn&#39;twork. Please help me!!! If you have any information on how to fix this problem and let me enjoy hamachi again, please post.</description>
