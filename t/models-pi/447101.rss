    <description>My server has Pernix but I want to change the model for it. All of the models are in the cache, raw folder, but whenever I went into itemdef.java and I looked a pernix body, this is what came up.
case 13354:
		itemDef.modelid = 62709;
		itemDef.name = &quot;Pernix body&quot;;
		itemDef.description = &quot;Pernix body&quot;;
		itemDef.modelZoom = 1378;
		itemDef.modelRotationY = 485;
		itemDef.modelRotationX = 2042;
		itemDef.modelOffset1 = -1;
		itemDef.modelOffset2 = 7;
		itemDef.anInt165 = 62744;
		itemDef.anInt200 = 62765;
		itemDef.groundActions = new String[5];
		itemDef.groundActions[2] = &quot;Take&quot;;
		itemDef.itemActions = new String[5];
		itemDef.itemActions[1] = &quot;Wear&quot;;
		itemDef.itemActions[2] = &quot;Check-charges&quot;;
		itemDef.itemActions[4] = &quot;Drop&quot;;
	break;

The model id is not in my raw folder.. Why is this and where is it?</description>
