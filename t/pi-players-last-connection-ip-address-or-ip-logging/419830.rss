    <title>[PI] Player&#39;s Last Connection IP address, or IP logging</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-players-last-connection-ip-address-or-ip-logging/419830</link>
    <description>Hi,

Is there a way in project insanity sources to where when a player logs in, or an account is created, it will AUTOMATICALLY save their IP address in a txt file with their name next to it?

For example:

No such user exsist
[REGISTERED] Bobby Has logged in
--- 

In text file

connections.txt:

bobby: 44.44.44.23 &lt;-random IP address.


This would help seeing that when people log in their is no IP addresses of their account being logged, or their is, but no name next to it to even know who&#39;s IP it belongs too.

It will stop greifers coming into my server, saying nasty things, and then logging out, I feel hopeless by only being able to ban then just so they can do it again.

Much help would be appreciated!</description>
