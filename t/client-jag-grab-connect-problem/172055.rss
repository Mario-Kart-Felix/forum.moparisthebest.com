    <title>Client JAG GRAB Connect Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-jag-grab-connect-problem/172055</link>
    <description>Hey people. Few of you probably tried my Music and Sound client  :P
But many people are having this problem and I have it gotten it once in a while. On launching the client, even though I have modified Sprite.java (This is a refactored client) to load the title screen from a different image file, once in a blue moon the client will try to Jag-Grab the title screen, and gets stuck on Requesting Title Screen for a while, then an Exception is thrown.

I had the client print out the file that was trying to be grabbed, and finally got the client to try and grab the file. It trys to grab the file &quot;title0&quot;.

Link to the client (Click a World): [url=http://allgofree.redirectme.net/rs/worldselect/]http://allgofree.redirectme.net/rs/worldselect/[/url]

Heres a screenshot:

Any idea how to stop the client from grabbing the file, though I don&#39;t know what causes it to try because this doesn&#39;t happen all the time.  :eek:</description>
