    <description>Okay,
Our server is being spammed by the owners of the players of the server we played before we started ours,
Since all their good player come to our server they are of the meaning they mus spam us.
Instead of spamming back I&#39;d rather like to add some good protection against this.
I&#39;ve looked up some tutorials but only found tutorials that black names with SYi or something.
If someone could hook me up with a good tutorial I&#39;d appreciate,

Thanks,
