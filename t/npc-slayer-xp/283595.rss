    <title>Npc Slayer Xp</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-slayer-xp/283595</link>
    <description>How would I go about making it so when say, you attack a chicken it gives you so much Xp for killing it for Slayer, I know it is possible. What I am asking for is the code. Not necessarily the whole code for all the NPC&#39;s in the slayer Tower. But just one of them and what file I would put it in. If you can help me with this I am very thankful

Thank you, Kevin</description>
