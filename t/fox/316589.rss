    <description>Well,

I got bored of working on this and decided to release my up-to-date work. I realize there&#39;s a lot of shit that&#39;s not exactly needed in the server. I never could be bothered to do a full clean out of the server.

All my work is easily distinguished by conventions and cleaner code compared to 98% of the client class.

Okay:

Base: wLv3
Economy: started, fairly medium.
Customs: No
Client required?: Any other than MoparScape.
Combat system: Shit
Features: Added.
Minigames: I think there&#39;s barrows, if there is- it wasn&#39;t added by me.
Clue-scrolls: Yes.

As there&#39;s still a bunch of ass-ramming uncle fuckers who use Czars and Allstar base, they won&#39;t complain about the combat. This server is adventure-based meaning you [U][B]DO NOT HAVE A FUCKING SKILLING AREA[/B][/U]. You must walk around the server to gain items and go places.

[CENTER]Updates:
[QUOTE]Updates:
Doors added on tut.isle
Shops added, soon to be 100% done
NPC Drops started thanks to Jeddac
Agility base added &lt;3 (pic coming soon)
Camelot tele added.
Teletabs started, models added to the client &lt;3
Glory added, soon ring of duel.
all of Varrocks shops are 100% runescape
Magic exp on the teleports X by 12 now
Arrows now show the exact amount that you are wielding, beforehand it only displayed the item&#39;s ID, before that it showed &quot;190&quot;
Wildy levels being worked on right now
Ardoungne teleport added
Added 100% Climbing boots from Tenzing, same place as RuneScape.
Teletabs finished.
Teleports being a bit nerfed so you dont glitch when in combat
Food 100% up until 377 food, jublys and monkfish included.
Fishing started.
Clues also started, very basic; but effective.
Potions being re-done.
Added agility shortcuts to some areas, just need to add some emotes.
Arrows will delete on use when I compile next.
Farming base made: probably exactly like delta&#39;s, very basic use item on object, show emote and give an item.
Adding poison.
Some npcs added, npc drops done.
Magic should be able to use staffs, combo runes(steam, mud, ect) and basic runes if magic is handled in client.java (there&#39;s no .cfg Wink)
Wildy is now ONLY in the wilderness, I&#39;m pretty sure i got 100% of the wildy areas covered. levels still dont work
Enchant spells work now, 95%, only thing missing is the GFX and onyx&#39;s magic. The exp is handled by ServerCP.
Gem crafting added, correct levels and emotes; only thing missing is onyx cut.
Adding amulet crafting to go with the enchant.
Doors to alkharid and Varrock Hillgiants require correct items and sendmessage.
Potions no longer give 137 in each stat, regulars give 111 and supers give 117, pic being uploaded.
For some reason it doesn&#39;t matter which clue you&#39;re doing it will delete all previous scrolls you might of used.
Clue scrolls no longer delete previous scrolls.
Wc speeds put in ServerCP to adjust economy.
Mining also in ServerCP.
Arrow handler is now in ServerCP to take out the dropping if the duping shits me.
Potions are being worked on and handled by ServerCP.
Weapon poisoning by means of poison&gt;items is started. So far DD (clean) has all its poisons.
Coal job added.
Karamja Banana Plantation added.
Door to Hill Giants requires key.
10GP toll added to Al-Kharid.[/QUOTE][/CENTER]

Clues do work, very basic and I haven&#39;t worked on them for a long time.

EDIT: I realize you probably want to see some credits, fine;
`Jeba - Why not?
winterLove - Base
Jeddac - (drops)
(Anthony) - (Packets)
2012 - (I learned switch-statements from one of his posts.)
Colby_ - (Helped with a part of my SuperHeat)
S Quare Quxx (Taught me timers)
Aeterna - (2D arrays)
Rs2o - (Normal arrays)
BreakPown (Delta) - (Looked at his servers code to learn how some stuff was done)
Webber - (I used his client, without it i&#39;d probably be still figuring out object ID&#39;s- or using SilabSoft.)

There&#39;s bound to be more names coming with future development.. D:</description>
