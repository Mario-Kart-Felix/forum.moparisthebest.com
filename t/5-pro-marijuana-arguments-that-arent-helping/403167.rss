<p>Have you ever tried smoking weed?  No?  Then your argument is based solely on here-say especially since you haven’t quoted one single reasonable study (or even an unreasonable one hahaha).  You continue to relate marijuana to alcohol but your ignorance will be the downfall of that argument.  They are nothing like eachother and affect you in very different ways.  A “few shots of whisky” would leave you not only much more “intoxicated” than a couple bowls, but is a completely different effect on your body as well.  It’s just like how both caffine and methamphetamine are drugs…but one is clearly a lot different!  Being high is nothing like being drunk and until you experience it I’d appreciate the end to all the ignorant non-sense…no offense.</p>

<p>hmm wtf, I thought I replied to this earlier.</p>
<p>I wasn’t saying that’s your argument, I’m just saying it’s treated as a valid argument by those who are opposed to legalization and it pisses me off. I see no reason for it to cause an increase in stoned drivers, and I’ve never seen some sort of facts/theories/anything to make me see otherwise. It’s just as bad of an argument, that’s all.</p>

And where does this idea come from? alcohol is totally legal, but not everyone drinks and certainly not everyone drinks and drives.</p>

<p>I don’t know, I’m not a doctor.  I don’t even know if there is a test for ‘how much weed you have in your system’ like the Blood Alcohol Content test for alcohol, but I’d think that would be something that needs ironed out in the legislation that legalizes it.  Let’s just assume there is such a device, right now, if you were caught driving with ANY weed in your system, you would be over the limit (of 0) and couldn’t drive.  But as soon as weed becomes legal,  what is the limit?  Surely some people would be too high to drive, but, as you said, where is the line?</p>
<p>And maybe it’s as simple as if they can pass a standard field sobriety test, like walking a line.  I don’t know.</p>

and the current system only targets illegal drug drivers and alcoholically intoxicated drivers<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Actually, that’s untrue. The RTA doesn’t distinguish between illegal and legal drugs. It just says that a person is guilty of an offense if they were unfit to drive through the use of drugs. If you cause an accident and it turns out you were whacked out of your brain on codeine or diphenhydramine or some other legal/OTC/prescription drug that impairs concentration you have broken the law.</p>
<p>This is UK specific ofc.[/quote]</p>
<p>Was unaware although I guess it makes sense. I wonder what is deemed abuse with legal drugs though :s</p>

<p>No, because I’m trying to make the point it is the same.  Obviously they are different drugs and the effects are somewhat different, but no one should ever drive when under the influence of either of them, or any other mind-altering drug either, legal or illegal.</p>
<p>I just don’t like it when certain people think it’s safe for them to smoke/drink a certain amount of a drug and then drive, and it’s even worse when they claim in makes them a better driver.</p>

<p>Actually, that’s untrue. The RTA doesn’t distinguish between illegal and legal drugs. It just says that a person is guilty of an offense if they were unfit to drive through the use of drugs. If you cause an accident and it turns out you were whacked out of your brain on codeine or diphenhydramine or some other legal/OTC/prescription drug that impairs concentration you have broken the law.</p>
<p>This is UK specific ofc.</p>

You seem to think 1 bowl of weed is like 3 shots of whiskey, you’re quite wrong.</p>
<p>I don’t condone it, I’m just saying that banning it all would mean you’d have to stop half the country driving (as driving on substances includes coffee and all the other prescription meds people drive on) and the current system only targets illegal drug drivers and alcoholically intoxicated drivers (probably had to make this illegal after a few people died when cars became more mainstream?)  so the entire system is bullshit and hobbled together.</p>

No and I never said that. Don’t put words in my mouth. Also it isn’t the same with alcohol as it is with weed. With weed, it only takes a few minutes to kick in and then you dont continuously get higher. Booze takes a lot longer so you may consume a lot, start driving home and end up become drunker as you drive. Either way, I’m not saying you should drink and drive or do any drugs and drive.<br>
also protip: if you decide to take acid, dont drive once you “completely sober” up. it seems like youre finally 100% but omg it can sneak right back in. terrifying.</p>

              <p>I don’t doubt that some people drive fine under the influence of many things, but the problem is that it is dependent on the individual. For example, I can’t drive stoned for shit. It makes me twitchy, nervous, overcautious and paranoid. I’ve driven many times on amphetamines, however, and I do just fine. This isn’t to say that it’s OK to drive high (everyone’s been young and stupid), quite the opposite, that since we can’t apply a rule to every individual, we ban it for all of them. There’s no situation ever where somebody NEEDS to drive high - if you know you have something important to do, don’t get high. If something important comes up when you’re already high, it better be a matter of life or death before you get in the car, and in those situations an ambulance is a better choice.</p>
<p>And again, this has no bearing on legalisation.</p>

              <p>For what it’s worth, impairment is induced by sleep deprivation as well. In fact, the graphs that describe alcohol-induced impairment and sleep-dep induced impairment are both exponential, and virtually identical after the 24 hours of being awake.</p>
<p>In Australia, we have a legal driving limit of 0.05 BAC (blood alcohol concentration). You can have two drinks and stay under it if you’re male of average weight and height.<br>
The point I’m making is similar to Greeny’s, I suspect. Ultimately we accept mild levels of impairment, otherwise it’d be a zero BAC across the board.<br>
The problem with marijuana is that, being illegal, nobody can quantify ‘acceptable’ or mild impairment levels.</p>
<p>I don’t agree with intentional drink driving, even when it is below the limit. I think someone should go out of their way to avoid driving if they’ve had anything to drink.<br>
But I do think acceptance of low range BAC isn’t the end of the world for those people who have no alternatives.<br>
My opinion for marijuana is similar, but the problem is the lack of information on the quantity that you can smoke before passing that mild level of impairment that society allows.</p>

<p>if a little kid ran out in front of you, you would probably kill them when it could have been avoided if not impaired.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I hate this example for a few reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>If a little kid ran out in front of you, ANYONE could hit the kid regardless of their current mental state. It’s a surprise, people fuck up a lot when they’re surprised no matter what.</li>
<li>For the past 3 years I have driven to a viewpoint over my town and smoked. It’s a 5 minute drive to my house from there. I’ve made it home every single night safely. I live on the coast of BC meaning there is a ton of animals. I pass/avoid about 6 or 7 deer/rabbits/raccoons every night, and never hit a single one. They are more of a surprise than a child, deers jump from the hills onto the road.</li>
<li>‘Heavy users’ of marijuana don’t get stoned like you might, MITB. I’ll smoke a blunt to myself, straight to the dome, and I know I’m stoned but at the same time, I’m not impaired. I feel sober, I don’t feel much different.<br>
Heavy smokers back me up here. It doesn’t make sense to those who have never indulged in drugs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, I’m not saying we can all smoke up and drive, yadayadayada. I’m just saying that that argument is a shitty one.<br>
I will never, ever drive when I’ve been drinking, no matter how much. We have a zero-tolerance law in BC for learners and new drivers. It’ll soon be in place for <span class="bbcode-i">all</span> drivers.</p>
<p>We should be allowed to make the decision ourselves of what we put in our bodies. I am a medical user (not cancer) and with weed in my life, sleeping, eating and everything have become a lot easier and all around a lot more enjoyable.</p>
