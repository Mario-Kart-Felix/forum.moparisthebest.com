SWIM drives regularly high finds that they drive better stoned over short journeys. SWIM thinks that this is because they feel more focussed on driving well, to avoid any sort of interaction with police primarily. SWIM doesn’t encourage this but is a choice that SWIM makes, and SWIM knows his limit of weed.<br>

<p>It’s this ridiculous bullshit that scares the shit out of me.  I ‘know my limit’ when it comes to alcohol too, but you still wouldn’t want me driving on the road while drunk.  The problem is when you are drunk/high/etc you THINK you are more focused on driving and are ‘avoiding interaction with police’, but in reality your sense of reality is distorted, and, chances are, if a little kid ran out in front of you, you would probably kill them when it could have been avoided if not impaired.[/quote]</p>
<p>Ever drive after drinking coffee? Taking paracetamol? Seriously think before you come out with this brainwashed nonsense. I’m not saying you can drive intoxicated with any drug, I’m simply saying your attitude is the reason drugs like this are illegal in the first place. I bet you have no scientific evidence to backup your mindset, you just assume.</p>
<p>Until there is some experiment proving one way or the other you just can’t say. I know for a fact I could drive high (after a couple of bowls) but if I’m too high I’d know before I even got to the car. The same could be said for drinking coffee, drive after a cup no problem. Now go drink 8 cups of coffee then drive… etc etc</p>
<p>That’s why you can legally drive up to a limit but it’s a dumb way to do it because different people have different tolerances to the drugs they are taking.</p>

<p>Did you read past that line of my post? As I explained myself but here goes again;</p>
<p>One is a pain killer the other a stimulant, they do effect you and if you took enough they’d affect your driving. In the same way a bowl of weed will get you high but if you had several then tried to drive you’d be a disaster waiting to happen.</p>
<p>People have these crazy misconceptions about the legal drugs they use being less harmful or powerful than the illegal ones.</p>
<p>EDIT: Antidepressants have driving warnings on them and about 1/3 of the country is on ADs. How is that not a danger in to drivers in the exact same way? and why does it get no attention?.. maybe because ADs are addictive and ingrained into society as a safe drug due to the doctors that hand them out and their status as legal. Plenty of medical studies have found severe issues with ADs yet still no attention. Kinda like how when mobile phones boomed all the studies which found them to cause cancer vanished out of the public eye. No-one gives a shit about you or your health, only their profit margin. Believing what they tell you about “drug” which grows out the ground seems like stupidity to me /highrant</p>

<p>I do not have that misconception at all, i just find some of your arguments very silly. Personally i’d like to see many drugs currently illegal legalized. Not for myself since i only drink alcohol, and that is because of the sheer amount of different flavours available.</p>

<p>It would be better to lay down the law and say no doing  while under the influence of any amount of certain substances such as .

<p>You think someone couldn’t fuck up their driving with too much coffee? I’m glad Sweden has antidepressants banned behind the wheel but UK and USA don’t.  If you realise those are dangerous then surely you realise other meds are; anything that can cause dizziness, stimulate, relax could be taken to excess like alcohol or cannabis.</p>
<p>I’d like to see someone drive with nicotine patches attached all the way up their arm. It’s legal but I bet it’s dangerous  :rolleyes:</p>

<p>if a little kid ran out in front of you, you would probably kill them when it could have been avoided if not impaired.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I hate this example for a few reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>If a little kid ran out in front of you, ANYONE could hit the kid regardless of their current mental state. It’s a surprise, people fuck up a lot when they’re surprised no matter what.</li>
<li>For the past 3 years I have driven to a viewpoint over my town and smoked. It’s a 5 minute drive to my house from there. I’ve made it home every single night safely. I live on the coast of BC meaning there is a ton of animals. I pass/avoid about 6 or 7 deer/rabbits/raccoons every night, and never hit a single one. They are more of a surprise than a child, deers jump from the hills onto the road.</li>
<li>‘Heavy users’ of marijuana don’t get stoned like you might, MITB. I’ll smoke a blunt to myself, straight to the dome, and I know I’m stoned but at the same time, I’m not impaired. I feel sober, I don’t feel much different.<br>
Heavy smokers back me up here. It doesn’t make sense to those who have never indulged in drugs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, I’m not saying we can all smoke up and drive, yadayadayada. I’m just saying that that argument is a shitty one.<br>
I will never, ever drive when I’ve been drinking, no matter how much. We have a zero-tolerance law in BC for learners and new drivers. It’ll soon be in place for <span class="bbcode-i">all</span> drivers.</p>
<p>We should be allowed to make the decision ourselves of what we put in our bodies. I am a medical user (not cancer) and with weed in my life, sleeping, eating and everything have become a lot easier and all around a lot more enjoyable.</p>

        <p>For what it’s worth, impairment is induced by sleep deprivation as well. In fact, the graphs that describe alcohol-induced impairment and sleep-dep induced impairment are both exponential, and virtually identical after the 24 hours of being awake.</p>
<p>In Australia, we have a legal driving limit of 0.05 BAC (blood alcohol concentration). You can have two drinks and stay under it if you’re male of average weight and height.<br>
The point I’m making is similar to Greeny’s, I suspect. Ultimately we accept mild levels of impairment, otherwise it’d be a zero BAC across the board.<br>
The problem with marijuana is that, being illegal, nobody can quantify ‘acceptable’ or mild impairment levels.</p>
<p>I don’t agree with intentional drink driving, even when it is below the limit. I think someone should go out of their way to avoid driving if they’ve had anything to drink.<br>
But I do think acceptance of low range BAC isn’t the end of the world for those people who have no alternatives.<br>
My opinion for marijuana is similar, but the problem is the lack of information on the quantity that you can smoke before passing that mild level of impairment that society allows.</p>

        <p>I don’t doubt that some people drive fine under the influence of many things, but the problem is that it is dependent on the individual. For example, I can’t drive stoned for shit. It makes me twitchy, nervous, overcautious and paranoid. I’ve driven many times on amphetamines, however, and I do just fine. This isn’t to say that it’s OK to drive high (everyone’s been young and stupid), quite the opposite, that since we can’t apply a rule to every individual, we ban it for all of them. There’s no situation ever where somebody NEEDS to drive high - if you know you have something important to do, don’t get high. If something important comes up when you’re already high, it better be a matter of life or death before you get in the car, and in those situations an ambulance is a better choice.</p>
<p>And again, this has no bearing on legalisation.</p>

No and I never said that. Don’t put words in my mouth. Also it isn’t the same with alcohol as it is with weed. With weed, it only takes a few minutes to kick in and then you dont continuously get higher. Booze takes a lot longer so you may consume a lot, start driving home and end up become drunker as you drive. Either way, I’m not saying you should drink and drive or do any drugs and drive.<br>
also protip: if you decide to take acid, dont drive once you “completely sober” up. it seems like youre finally 100% but omg it can sneak right back in. terrifying.</p>

        <p>Interestingly though in the UK you could take maybe 1 shot of whiskey then drive? Not sure how strong it is. Notice though you had to say a few then drive, and I said smoke one bowl then drive, you’re already talkinga bout a few drinks. So all my argument about quanitity and tolerance levels stands. You seem to think 1 bowl of weed is like 3 shots of whiskey, you’re quite wrong.</p>
<p>I don’t condone it, I’m just saying that banning it all would mean you’d have to stop half the country driving (as driving on substances includes coffee and all the other prescription meds people drive on) and the current system only targets illegal drug drivers and alcoholically intoxicated drivers (probably had to make this illegal after a few people died when cars became more mainstream?)  so the entire system is bullshit and hobbled together.</p>

<p>and the current system only targets illegal drug drivers and alcoholically intoxicated drivers</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Actually, that’s untrue. The RTA doesn’t distinguish between illegal and legal drugs. It just says that a person is guilty of an offense if they were unfit to drive through the use of drugs. If you cause an accident and it turns out you were whacked out of your brain on codeine or diphenhydramine or some other legal/OTC/prescription drug that impairs concentration you have broken the law.</p>
<p>This is UK specific ofc.</p>

</aside>
<p>No, because I’m trying to make the point it is the same.  Obviously they are different drugs and the effects are somewhat different, but no one should ever drive when under the influence of either of them, or any other mind-altering drug either, legal or illegal.</p>
<p>I just don’t like it when certain people think it’s safe for them to smoke/drink a certain amount of a drug and then drive, and it’s even worse when they claim in makes them a better driver.</p>

        <p>And as Lothy said, sleep deprived driving, texting and driving, anything that distracts a driver is bad.</p>
<p>Obviously some things affect people less, like drinking a Coke or even a Mountain Dew and then driving would be fine, drinking 10 Red Bulls and driving would not.</p>

        <p>So why do you say that drinking a coke and driving is fine, but having a small toke is not?</p>
<p>I happen to agree with you, but why are they different? Both are affecting the users CNS system, to different degrees in different people, and in both cases there are people who think it’s ok. Where is the line?</p>
