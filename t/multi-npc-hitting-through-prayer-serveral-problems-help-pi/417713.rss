    <title>Multi Npc, hitting through prayer? serveral problems HELP! [PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/multi-npc-hitting-through-prayer-serveral-problems-help-pi/417713</link>
    <description>hey, what i wanted is for a npc (8596) to hit through my melee prayer, so i have this in npchandler :

if(c.prayerActive[18] || c.curseActive[9]) { // protect from melee
						damage = 0;
					else if (c.prayerActive[18] &amp;&amp; npcs[i].npcType == 8596) {
						damage = damage * 0.78;

that didnt work can anyone tell me why?
(im using teamtorva)


.
also i wanted to make the area multi, so i made it so more than 1 player can hit a npc, but what i also need is more than 1 npc can hit a player?

i added this in player.java

(absX &gt;= 3065 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 3081 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 3795 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 3814)

and another one in npc.java (for multi players hitting npc)


lastly, i wanted to make 8596 aggressive so i added his case under this. It didnt work?  :


	public boolean isAggressive(int i) {
		switch (npcs[i].npcType) {
			case 6260:
			case 6261:
			case 6263:
			case 6265:
			case 6222:
			case 6223:
			case 6225:
			case 6227:
			case 6247:
			case 6248:
			case 6250:
			case 6252:
			case 1158:
			case 1160:
			case 1154:
			case 1157:
			case 1156:
			case 795:

			case 8133:
			case 3101:
			case 3102:
			case 5666:
			case 3103:
			case 8596:
			
			case 2892:
			case 2894:
			case 2881:
			case 50:
			case 2882:
			case 2883:

			case 6203:
			case 6206:
			case 6208:
			case 6204:
			return true;		
		}



1. why doesnt it hit through pray
2. why cant mutliple npc hit a player in the area?
3. why isnt the npc aggressive?
