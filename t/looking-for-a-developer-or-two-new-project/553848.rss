    <title>Looking for a Developer or Two (New Project)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-developer-or-two-new-project/553848</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve played around with Java coding before and worked on coding a 317 server in the past, however it&#39;s been years wince my last interaction with Java. I&#39;m open to learning once more as I intend to start up another server...In those regards, i&#39;d like one to two experienced coders who would like to help me get my project off the ground. 

[b][u]What i&#39;m looking for...[/u][/b]

1.) I&#39;m most likely going to be a complete noob at Java so [b]Patience[/b] is key

2.) Someone who can easily and clearly explain things as they lend a hand (I am an adult, so you won&#39;t need  to worry about the bullshit that comes along with trying to teach a pre-teen new things.)

3.) Available to speak on skype or related communication services during weeks and sometimes afternoons during the week. (I get it, my job keeps me busy as hell too, real life always comes first. I&#39;m flexible, promise.)

4.) Trustworthy individuals are VERY important. It should go without saying that I&#39;m not interested in working with a total dirtbag with no semblance of morals whatsoever. Not to say anything bad about the RSPS community, but i&#39;ve met a wide variety of people over the years that give the community a bad name. 

5.) I&#39;m sure I can go on and on with this so i&#39;ll leave number 5 onwards open to whatever bragging and skills/personality you can offer me. 


[u][b]What I can contribute/Do for you[/b][/u]

1.) I have more than enough funds to support the initial launch of the server, meaning....I can pay for the VPS, Banners for sites if applicable, paypal for donations is set already, website is up also, and any other monetary related issues with server development can come out of my pocket during development. 

2.) 50/50 on all donations (Or equal three way split for an additional developer....I sucked at math in Highschool, give me a break.) 

3.) I have limited time because of my career, however, weekends i&#39;m more or less free. I also have an eagerness to learn (Cheesy as this may sound, it appeals to some people.) 

4.) Ask me. If you&#39;re wondering something about me or my resources, don&#39;t be shy, ask. I may or may not tell you certain things about me for reasons, but i&#39;m more or less an open book beside the fact. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope to hear from possible partners and developers.

<p>That being said. This is the wrong section to ask for developers. Next time you should post in the <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,149.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Development Teams</a> section. However, I’ve reported the thread as incorrect location (Don’t worry, you don’t get in trouble for it, it’s just to notify the mods) so it can be moved.</p>
