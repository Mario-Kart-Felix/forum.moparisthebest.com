    <title>[PI] Better Combat?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-better-combat/522588</link>
    <description>Ok, so I am using an older PI Base, and the combat is not completely terrible, but it certainly is not that good. I do not work with combat formulas often so this is new to me. I was wondering what could make combat better? Just fighting players in general, switching, hit delays, etc.. I found a few tutorials but they seem to contradict one another to often. If you know of the best combat base tutorial, please let me know or post your own solutions. Thanks! :D</description>
