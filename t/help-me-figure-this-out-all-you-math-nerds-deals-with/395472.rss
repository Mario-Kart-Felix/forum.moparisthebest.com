    <description>havent been in this area of math for a bit and people are trying to figure this out for mount and blade

ok

Round time: 7:00
Repair fee: 5% of total price
Chance of armor breaking every minute: 4%
Gold gain every minute: 50

Basically every minute the system scans through every item slot. Each slot has a 4% chance of breaking, which is a 5% repair fee. Also every minute, you gain 50 gold. At the end of the round you should have earned 300 gold (not counting repair fees), and also pay for any repair fees.

What is the max amount of armors worth you can wear without losing gold?

That should be all the values needed


I said 6000, simply by saying 300 gold a round, 300 is 5% of 6000, so 6000 total will keep you level.

But someone else has told me 25000, stating only some armor breaks every round, not all (I assumed worst case scenario above)</description>

              <p>25000 is the correct one. You forgot to take the 4% breakchance into you calculation.<br>
(50 / 4) * 100 = 1250 (Gold got before something breaks)<br>
1250 * 20 = 25000 ( A armour worth 25000 will give 1250 in fees, and keep yourselves in 0).</p>
<p>But remember to account for bad luck.</p>
