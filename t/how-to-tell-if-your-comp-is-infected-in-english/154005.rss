    <description>Well as you know, well mabye not, but people keep getting keyloggers/trojans when they can stop it in early stages!!


One thing is that before the virus itself will ruin ur comp badly is that youll get a fake bubble on your toolbar thing on corner next to the time. It will be a bigger red sheild than other virus bubble and windows bubbles. This is the virus, not windows. The shield will have a white &quot;X&quot; on it telling you that ur comp is infected. First thing you is scan your comp with GOOD software. NOT ONES THAT YOU GOT FREE OR 99 cents! Make sure it is a good scanner. I use McAfee and it helps me everytime. Remember do NOT click the bubble. This is just activate the virus/trojan. If you do, then you have a bad chance of getting out but a good one in a sense.



Basic virus info.

There are many viruses. There are worms, trojans, keyloggers, ect ect. Basic names of viruses are, &quot;Not a virus, Elite keylogger, trojan horse, and sometimes some random foreign words...

Viruses can make several pop-ups, take down your firewall, ruin your comp, take private info without a needed pass, record your mouse clicks, and more.

Viruses can be bad with some perm damage rarely, but you can spot one and delete it before too much gets gone.



The signs of a virus.

Several unstoppable pop-ups. Starts when you start your internet. They will continue until your comp just shuts down, freezez, or goes blue screen on you.

Slow-ness. Your computer will go slower than it usually does. If it does then scan your computer to make sure you have no virus. The slowness is the virus taking and changing your personal info. !Remember! Scan your computer weekly/monthly to check for viruses before they can do some REAL damage.

Changes on your computer. Sometimes you will see changed that you/your family hasent made. Well your new room mate, a virus, will change stuff just to get you mad for fun. They will change/delete your files so that they are hard to find. If you see any changes u didnt make or authorize, scan your computer.

There are more, but you will be able to spot them out if you can get the stuff above.


What to do.

Your joking right? Well if you dont know what to do, just first. SCAN YOUR COMPUTER.
If you have a virus, its obvious, delete it. Unless you like having your computer messed up and you want someone doing this then go ahead keep it. Im no computer doctor but if you keep it on your computer ur personal files will be fed, deleted, and your computer will turn into crap and youll got to either nuke it [restart it] or just get a new one and give the infected one to your friend for a prank.

Keylogger, DO NOT TYPE ANY PASSWORDS, EMAILS, CREDIT CARD NUMBERS, OR ANY OTHER PRIVATE NUMBERS. They will just be sent to the keylogger sender. Just scan your computer with a special virus scanner to find and delete it. Then scan after its gone to make sure its gone for good. To avoid a keylogger just scan/delete any bad/unknown emails and stay off bad sites. To see if its bad get a virus system or somethign that has a site rater. It will tell you if its bad, moderate, unsafe, or serious. Well this is mine. Some will also give you a reason why its bad and sometimes redirect your comp to their main site to tell you its bad and if you wish to overide it. Also, stay off pr0n sites. They have viruses dude. Just go buy a playboy if your lonely.

For others just delete te virus before it cuases bad damage and delete bad files and stay off bad sites.


REMEMBER, scan ALL items before downloaded. Including emails. Keyloggers/trojans are sent over emails 82-90% of the time.

no but it’s one of the big factors of how most people ages 12-20 get them, and thats around the ages of the people on these forums, plus with all of us being on the comp the greater half of the day we will be more likely to jack off while looking at porn, thus maybe even downloading some, thus, maybe getting their computer infected.</p>
