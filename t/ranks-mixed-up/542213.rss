    <title>Ranks mixed up</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ranks-mixed-up/542213</link>
    <description>Basically im confused because the helper rank in my source has all the ranks of a helper but is able to spawn like an admin and the yell comes up as an administrator (I can fix that part). If anyone could offer some guidance or help me over teamviewer, it would be greatly appreciated. This is a 718 source.</description>
