    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/allstar-animations/437272</link>
    <description>Hey Mopar! I just started programming recently and I&#39;m working on an Allstar source just for the fun of it.  I have changed the emote  tab to the correct text and when I programmed the buttons to make my player do the animations the button makes my character do nothing.  In other words, the button does not work and does not make my character do the right emote.

[code]            case 168:
                // yes emote
		pEmote = 855;	
                break;[/code]
Sorry if my conventions are off, I will have to read up on them soon, but yeah.  That is just the code for the yes button.  I want to know how I can make it work.  I have tried many many things...
Anyways, thank you guys for all your help and support you have given me!</description>

              <p>I’m not an expert on Allstar sources, by any means, but check out your pEmote method. From what I see, that code should work.</p>
<p>What exactly is the problem?</p>

<p>I have that above one button because the teleport was credited to Mod Allstar, but since I changed the button why still give him credit? If it is really that big of a deal to you, i will remove it. But instead of making useless comments that don’t help anyone, why can’t you make a good suggestion? I use to look up to you because I thought you were a helpful, smart person, but you just lost my respect…</p>

</aside>
<p>Cuz I hate messy sources, and people taking creds for every line they add</p>
<p>you could set on top</p>

<p>Put the void for your buttons in your clicking packet</p>
