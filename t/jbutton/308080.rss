        JFrame frame = new JFrame(&quot;Nubsakes&quot;); /*Create a frame with the title &quot;Title&quot; */
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); /*This is so the window closes when user clicks on the the X*/
        frame.setSize(700, 700); /*Create a frame of 500x500*/
        frame.setVisible(true); /*Set the frame visible*/

Dear Adam,</p>
<p>The point of abraham’s flame was to inform you that simply giving somebody the code will not help. On the other hand, if you would have explained why the button needs to be added to a top-level container and given him a tutorial, then the OP would’ve increased in knowledge and, possibly, epeen. What you have just given him was fuckfood. Now, he knows to write that code, but what does it do? Explaining will help him see the bigger picture and comprehend problems on his own. Of course, we all want to seem cool so I don’t half blame you.</p>
<p>-Tenen<br>
[/quote]Dear Tenen,</p>
<p>However, simply telling him to fuck-off accomplishes what? You notice that I was the only one willing to give him help; yet, you pick apart what I did. If you want to point out the wrong in others, you should start with the individuals that were unwilling to help.</p>

Let’s say you have a plain piece of paper and a cardboard boat shape. You want the boat shape to be on the paper. Therefore, you must glue to boat shape onto the paper. Same thing goes for the JFrame and JButton. You have a JFrame (paper) and you want it to have a JButton (boat shape). You must attach the JButton to the JFrame with the <span class="bbcode-i">add</span> method:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">frame.add(btn);</code></pre>
<p>Furthermore, you can read a comprehensive and in-depth tutorial on your subject here: <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/index.html" data-bbcode="true">http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/index.html</a></p>

I wasn’t aware that a Computer Science major could deprive someone of a general knowledge question pertaining to java. And I’m pretty sure I have the mental capacity to comprehend what’s going on here; however, unlike you I’m not one of the assholes trolling around boasting about how much I know and how much I’m not going to share with other people.</p>

<p>hey abraham, you are cool for depriving this community of general knowledge. Someone has to learn somewhere. As far as I’m concerned, I don’t give a shit what you think.</p>

It encourages laziness…so I guess it really depends on your point of view.[/quote]<br>
I mean you could say something like</p>
<p>“frame is a component and so is JButton you must add the jbutton on to the frame ( hint: add(); ) ;)”</p>
<p>Help them understand it rather than throwing tutorials at them because as soon as you click that link you don’t know wtf you’re looking at or what to look for. Its not spoon feeding if you hold his hand and let him do <span class="bbcode-i">some</span> thinking. Eventually it will just <em>click</em> and he’ll understand how it all works. Until then don’t act like retards.</p>
<p>Im not really sticking up for him but in all honesty you ALL know people have asked worse questions than this. At least he knew to present code and his problem all he needed was a little help.</p>
