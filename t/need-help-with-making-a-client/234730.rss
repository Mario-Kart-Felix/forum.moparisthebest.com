    <title>Need help with making a client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-making-a-client/234730</link>
    <description>OK I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get flamed out of my mind for posting this and you&#39;ll say there&#39;s load of tutorials out there but please, save your reputation. I know that. I&#39;ve read all of them and I&#39;ve spent two full days trying to figure this out. I know some really basic java. I just finished a 900 page book on it (Java ALL-IN-ONE DESK REFERENCE For Dummies) and I&#39;ve been looking through these tutorials and I keep getting stuck. I want to make a pking client for the new PVP update. I just want to add some hooks like your hp, your opponents combat lvl, and prayer left (if that&#39;s possible). I&#39;m not asking you to spoon feed me the code or make the entire client for me, I just need some further help (preferably over MSN) on how to make this. I HAVE searched google but I couldn&#39;t find any help (that I could understand). I&#39;ll post it here when/if I finish it.

If you can help me, add my msn. TheGopher10@hotmail.com
If you can help me out, please just add me and it shouldn&#39;t take more than 20 minutes for me to get it.

Thanks,
TheGopher (noob)</description>

              <p>I didn’t bother adding it to rsbot because the fields were only valid in combat like qauters said. In which case the HP bar is there anyway. The only benefit is if you added something to check online and comeback with a number rather than a ratio. But i cbf’ed implementing that.</p>

That still isn’t accurate ^^, but roughly. Didn’t get your second part though??[/quote]</p>
<p>the second part : to not have to re get the total hp from the highscore save the ones you already have and re use them.</p>

<p>That is a lot of calculations for the server to do, it used to send totalHP and currentHP and let the client perform the calculations.  Even if what you say is true, you could still grab the totalHP from the highscores page, apply the percentage and get the currentHP that way, it wouldn’t be too hard or time consuming to do.<br>

He is true, they currently send a value between 0 and 30 (the amount of green pixels (x-wise) to draw ^^).<br>
It takes less cpu power to calculate currentHP/totalHP * 30 then to send them both (encrypted), also saves bandwidth<br>
They changed it a few months ago.[/quote]If that is true, then could we not paint the health over everyone?</p>

i do beleive the server does the calculations and then sends the percent to the client, the client then draws the square with this percentage. so the most you could put abov ethe heads would the something like “20%”<br>

I am aware that you can’t get other people’s hitpoint and prayer levels anymore but I’m trying to design it so that it makes pking easier for you. I want it to be sorta like RSBot where you can see other players’ combat levels and names above their heads. I’m thinking to have the user decide what level players they are willing to fight and what levels they aren’t willing to fight and they can set it so that they will attack everyone up to 3 levels below them and those players will have their combat level above their head in green. Then say they don’t want to attack anyone over their combat level. The combat level above those higher level players’ heads would be red. That way you can quickly scan the area and see if there’s anyone you want to attack instead of having to right click and look at their combat levels. And I was thinking It would show you your attack/str/def levels on the side so you can see if you need to pot up again. I’ve just been thinking “what would give a pker an advantage over another pker?” There are a lot of possibilities and features to add. I just wanted to make this client as a pking aid, not really even a bot or anything.</p>
