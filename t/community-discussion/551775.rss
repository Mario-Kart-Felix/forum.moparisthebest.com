    <description>Hey guys,

Tom recently posted a topic on how to boost community interest and one of the interests was putting up the official server. However, through out the official servers development we&#39;ve had multiple debates about how to approach the project as a whole and incorporate you guys. I think on that front we have failed, on part because when we first originally decided to move forward on the project in our private topic we thought that we wouldn&#39;t have to ask for the help of the community. Well, correctly said we meant we shouldn&#39;t expect the help of the community. Well now you will have your chance, you are welcome to post here and together we can coordinate a solution to helping this become a success.

There are many of you out there who are talented, and I want to bring you in to form a team. Davidi2 and I cannot do this alone! Your support, and involvement will help see this be finished. We need some people with better track records than mine on the completion department to balance the scale. :P

Here&#39;s a few topics of discussion we&#39;ve had with MITB/myself/David:

- Compensation
- Content Development
- Version control
- Core Development

I&#39;ll touch up on each.

Compensation was discussed to be given to those with outstanding records of helping out with the progress of the server. How so? It wasn&#39;t entirely confirmed but it could be discussed on a case to case basis or even a reward for each person who at least assists.

Content development was a tricky subject. The community is mostly fluent in java, I have been insistent on scripting, however with the introduction of lambda expressions in Java 7 I feel as if a java solution could be engineered. Of course I stress this system is very important, because the easier it is to use for you all then the more content we can develop and the more time people will spend player on the server.

Version control isn&#39;t something we&#39;re willing to budge on. However I think we can use something like Gitlabs to coordinate milestones, and issues. This will help the people developing for the server to work more as a team.

Core development is tricky. ScapeEmu is by no means a bad base however it faces all the modern issues most bases face. If you want me to get into more detail about that, I&#39;d love to. I feel a service based architecture is achievable, and that is something I would love to theory craft with you and share my insight.

I would like to have an IRC discussion at a scheduled date and time to discuss all of these topics and any questions, ideas you have. Please let me know here when you would be able to attend such an event. 

Thanks guys.</description>

<li>You don’t have to do an entire thing at once, one person can just collect data and submit data structures for them. Another can work out the algorithm of how the skill will work, etc, etc. Eventually it will also come together.</li>

<p>We hope to address all these concerns in real time on the possible IRC conversation date.</p>
