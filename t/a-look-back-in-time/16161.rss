          <blockquote>
              <blockquote>"Well, heres a quick summary of the bot going to be known to you all as AutoRune 2-a. But first, a little background on myself. 
I am a seasoned developer with alot of experiance behind me, I was approached by Josh with a challenge, one which I willingly accepted. 
Basically he asked me to take my experiance in the commerical world and apply it to runescape to bring a unqiue prospective with alot of 
innovation into the realm. Now I have taken my time to go around and look at what other people have been producing. Aryan, Sbot3 and various 
other little bots not worth mentioning. I have to say, their developers lack alot of skill, do not get me wrong but they arent achieving 
anything ground breaking. They inject their own code into the client and are full of dirty 'hacks' to make it work. 
<p>So back to the point? What WILL AutoRune 2 do? Well lets get into the details of the archietecture first.<br>
AutoRune 2 will NOT inject ANY code into the client WHATSOEVER. Now I point this out for various reasons,<br>
to do so makes you very vulnerable to any attempts by jagex to disable your application or to detect your users.<br>
Also, this bot shall never call any method directly in the client. The only interfacing this app will do with the<br>
client is infact post mouse events to it via the event dispatch thread. All of the clicks shall be generated in their<br>
own location outside the runescape codebase to remove any potential detection. The clicks shall use advanced algorithms<br>
for human like mouse simulation as to prevent jagex from analyzing the coordinate history. No more flagging worries.</p>
<p>Now some of you will be thinking “oh, a scar remake”, no. This system will be much more powerful than scar, and will not<br>
expose actual coordinates to the script users making the scripting simple easy and powerful. Now I know there have been a<br>
couple of various attempts at such systems to but take a look at the best coded rs2 bot around in the public domain (Aryan)<br>
half of their accessor methods do not actually simulate a click properly and make no attempt to simulate proper human behaviour.</p>
<p>To get to another point that appears to crop up in RS2 bot design (atleast for the public domain) are the heavy requirements<br>
on programming knowledge to script for these applications. The end users should not be expected to be proficient in programming<br>
in order to make their own scripts quickly for their own purposes. There is alot of drive behind the text scripting engine in<br>
autorune and there has been various attempts to recreate this in bots apparently, however these bots parse the text of the scripts<br>
introducing a huge memory problem and severly limits the JVMS Hotspot Compiler from optomising the code. So the proposed system is<br>
for not just text scripts, but for java scripts aswell which shall allow the end users to decide on which is more appropriate for themselves.<br>
The big difference is that the text scripts will generate PROPER java class files transparently for the user. This is a much more optimal<br>
design for this problem. This will mean that there wont be any additional benefit from using java scripting other than personal preferance.</p>
<p>Well, not that you have all skipped the previous paragraphs lets just get down the juicy bits with a brief summary.</p>
<p>What will it DO?<br>
*It will do EVERYTHING, fighting, fishing, walking, talking, cyber sex and others! All of which will be implemented in human like ways<br>
*It shall handle randoms! Perfect, now jagex cant bother us<br>
*Advanced anti ban system<br>
*Advanced techniques for attaching to the actual runescape codebase without them knowing!<br>
*Powerful and simple TEXT scripting similar to the loved but currently lost Autorune style<br>
*Plugin system for all of your little fetishes, allowing you to incorporate pking toolkits and anything else you can dream up<br>
*Advanced logging and reporting system</p>
<p>There isnt much more to say on it, other than check back soon for the released version. If you have any wishes for features<br>
dont hesistate to ask <a href="mailto:dev@autoruneltd.co.uk">dev@autoruneltd.co.uk</a>. As I said, I am a corporate developer doing this is as a side project mainly for fun,<br>
I have little experiance with actually playing the game and all of my decisions for what will be going in comes from a few weeks<br>
of research. I am not saying that I am limited in my knowledge in the game but rather havent had enough time to realise that you really<br>
want a quick method for putting on a pink dress while wavign around a dragon battleaxe in battle. But hey, if you want it, ask for it."</p>
