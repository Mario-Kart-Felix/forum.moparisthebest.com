    <title>The greatest rsps ever</title>

    <description>[u][b][size=14pt]First Idea[/size][/b][/u]
I was thinking about this for a while, what if I made a server that is PVP and skiller.

Instead of mixing the two, which usualy ends up makeing the server a SKilling server, how about seperating them.

The player gets one choice. 

At the begining of the game, when they first log in have two portals. One leads to the Pvp side of the server, the other leading to the skilling side.

If they choose the PVP side, there will be an NPC that gives them 99 in all combat skills, and 700m. (or make npc&#39;s to train on, that give like 50x the normal exp.)

On the skilling side, there will be npc&#39;s to train on, but they give a much slower exp rate, still faster then rs but slower then the pvp server.
Of course it will have the theiving, agility, farming, ect. areas. You can still fight, but that side is mainly basedon skilling.

There will be a portal for the two to meet, but they wont be able to go to the other side of the server.

Tell me what you think.</description>
