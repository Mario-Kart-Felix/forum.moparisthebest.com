I’m related to everybody.<br>
If your dad had 2 parents, and your mom has 2 parents, that’s 4 extra people, then multiply that by 2 because they each had 2 parents, 8 people, then 16, and so on.</p>
<p>Eventually it leads on to you being related to everybody who ever lived in the world. Yes, even the chinese.</p>

</aside>
<p>yet he isn’t the youngest president the states has seen, and there have been 17 presidents within 5 years of obamas age, are you saying all those presidents weren’t qualified to run the country as well? or is it just obama and the 4~ other presidents that were younger than him?</p>

<p>besides the obvious points to make (how would one measure how much a person loves a country? should presidents that love the country less than foreign citizens not be allowed to be the president?), to be a president in the united states you NEED to have been native-born, or have both parents who were native-born, one does not simply become a president of the united states without being an american</p>

<p>Was talking to bowser.</p>
<p>So someone who has heard about life but never experienced it should lead the country? You need to experience life before you even think of running for president. Ronald Reagan was 80+ years old. When he was 20, I’m pretty sure he was thinking about making movies rather than running the country. Young people are too radical to be a strong president.</p>
