those numbers are only that high because he hired back the union workers he laid off, and also he has only created more government jobs witch means tax payers are paying for them. there is no signs of economic growth to be seen, and no sign of unemployment going down. you need to do your home work before posting left wing media poll.</p>

<p>Obama has blatantly lied on multiple occasions. Not saying other presidents haven’t, but I really don’t trust Obama. A lot of the stuff he promised he would do, hasn’t been done. “Oh the Congress cock-blocked him” Bullshit. He had the majority of the senate seats during the first two years of his being in office. Sit down, shut up and let someone else have their turn at ruining America.</p>

Wrong. Bush is only responsible for the $2T debt he caked up from the 2 wars. He didn’t do anything super detrimental to the country other than his foreign dickhead policy, but put yourself in his shoes. Hed look bad if he didn’t go to war after 9/11 also. But the wars should not have been this long at all.</p>
<p>Heres where people get confused and I hope you correct yourself and others around you that share the same opinion:</p>
<p>Carter is responsible for the collapse of 2008. He had a policy that pushed banks to give loans to people who wouldn’t normally qualify for loans a few decades ago. And when those people couldn’t pay back the housing market collapsed because the banks had to compensate. Now, this policy was under the radar for years until like I said, that generation finally hit its peak.</p>
<p>Clinton was unaware of these policies because he was the president during the internet boom which created TONS of jobs and everyone was all pippy happy. Bush didn’t see any hurt of these policies either - yet. And by time clinton was out of office people forgot about it.</p>
<p>Just a heads up Carter is known as our worst president in history by almost everyone.</p>

Re-elect Obama. He’s helped the economy far better than almost any president. It seems as if we’re broker then ever and you assume he’s doing “self-beneficial plans,” though that’s false. It was George W. Bush that fucked us over. After Bush left office, the Bush Administration left us with a dying economy and Obama has turned the unemployment-rate from increasing by 950,000 a year to 100,000 a year. If re-elected, he will have the unemployment rate decreasing by a few hundred thousand if he keeps up the work he’s doing.</p>
<p>He’s a far better president than what we’ve been getting for the past years, America needs Obama at this point of desperation.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Wrong. Bush is only responsible for the $2T debt he caked up from the 2 wars. He didn’t do anything super detrimental to the country other than his foreign dickhead policy, but put yourself in his shoes. Hed look bad if he didn’t go to war after 9/11 also. But the wars should not have been this long at all.</p>
<p>Heres where people get confused and I hope you correct yourself and others around you that share the same opinion:</p>
<p>Carter is responsible for the collapse of 2008. He had a policy that pushed banks to give loans to people who wouldn’t normally qualify for loans a few decades ago. And when those people couldn’t pay back the housing market collapsed because the banks had to compensate. Now, this policy was under the radar for years until like I said, that generation finally hit its peak.</p>
<p>Clinton was unaware of these policies because he was the president during the internet boom which created TONS of jobs and everyone was all pippy happy. Bush didn’t see any hurt of these policies either - yet. And by time clinton was out of office people forgot about it.</p>
<p>Just a heads up Carter is known as our worst president in history by almost everyone.[/quote]<br>

those numbers are only that high because he hired back the union workers he laid off, and also he has only created more government jobs witch means tax payers are paying for them. there is no signs of economic growth to be seen, and no sign of unemployment going down. you need to do your home work before posting left wing media poll.[/quote]<br>
And the mindless right wing people are soo great? The only reason half of you ignorant people are right winged is becuz your local church told you too…</p>

<p>Obviously ‘in the first place’, the planes flew into the buildings because they were flying through the air towards the buildings.</p>

<p>You are retarded due to your own imbecilic nature. You are one of those Illuminati idiots who is ready to point the fucking finger at anything merely because something that you can’t comprehend what happens in the world. Some people claim that man made God out of his own fear and ignorance. I feel the same way about the Illuminati. Its just an ideal held by people who are displeased with the idea of a greater being so they need to find another way to explain the world.</p>
<p>I am not disputing the fact that individual’s ulterior motives influence world policies, because this is commonly seen in the world, but I am expressing my doubt that these actions are all orchestrated by a super secret organization.</p>
<p>So yes, that reply states why I think you are an idiot and why I think you were trolling.</p>

<p>Re-elect Obama. He’s helped the economy far better than almost any president. It seems as if we’re broker then ever and you assume he’s doing “self-beneficial plans,” though that’s false. It was George W. Bush that fucked us over. After Bush left office, the Bush Administration left us with a dying economy and Obama has turned the unemployment-rate from increasing by 950,000 a year to 100,000 a year. If re-elected, he will have the unemployment rate decreasing by a few hundred thousand if he keeps up the work he’s doing.</p>
<p>He’s a far better president than what we’ve been getting for the past years, America needs Obama at this point of desperation.</p>

<p>those numbers are only that high because he hired back the union workers he laid off, and also he has only created more government jobs witch means tax payers are paying for them. there is no signs of economic growth to be seen, and no sign of unemployment going down. you need to do your home work before posting left wing media poll.<br>

And the mindless right wing people are soo great? The only reason half of you ignorant people are right winged is becuz your local church told you too…</p>

<p>Wrong. Bush is only responsible for the $2T debt he caked up from the 2 wars. He didn’t do anything super detrimental to the country other than his foreign dickhead policy, but put yourself in his shoes. Hed look bad if he didn’t go to war after 9/11 also. But the wars should not have been this long at all.</p>
<p>Heres where people get confused and I hope you correct yourself and others around you that share the same opinion:</p>
<p>Carter is responsible for the collapse of 2008. He had a policy that pushed banks to give loans to people who wouldn’t normally qualify for loans a few decades ago. And when those people couldn’t pay back the housing market collapsed because the banks had to compensate. Now, this policy was under the radar for years until like I said, that generation finally hit its peak.</p>
<p>Clinton was unaware of these policies because he was the president during the internet boom which created TONS of jobs and everyone was all pippy happy. Bush didn’t see any hurt of these policies either - yet. And by time clinton was out of office people forgot about it.</p>
<p>Just a heads up Carter is known as our worst president in history by almost everyone.</p>

<p>Why did 911 happen in the first place? Do you think a random group of terriosts attacked america for no reason? Wrong we provoked it in the first place, well i should not say we, but really the right winged part of our fantastic goverment.[/quote]<br>
