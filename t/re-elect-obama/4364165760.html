        <p>It’s my belief, deal with it. I should have as much right to post my opinion as anyone else on this site without being flamed or receiving “backlash”.</p>
<p>As for the United States being in the Bible:</p>
<p>No, it is not in the Bible. However, a well known prophecy in the Bible states that Rome will be restored as the power of the world.</p>
<p>England, like the rest of Western Europe, will be under the apostate influence of Rome and the Antichrist; for there is no power faithfully protesting against this iniquity. For similar reasons, if I might venture to give an opinion (and I never think of giving one’s own thought as more than that), it is that the United States of America will be swamped into a political marsh; and as they have been hitherto a mere conglomerate from the rest of the world, especially from Europe, comprising no doubt a vast deal of skill, industry and enterprise, but also not a little of the scum and refuse of all nations; so I believe they will break up into factions of noisy primitive elements; and, after going off in boastful vaporing, will at length burst as a bubble.</p>
<p>It is a fact that there is no place in prophecy for a vast influential power, such as the American United States would naturally be, if it long so retained its cohesion. Is it conceivable that there should be such a power existing at that day without any mention of it? Can the omission be accounted except by its dissolution? Note: think of what the Rapture will do to the United States with so many caught up, and the restraining power of the Holy Spirit gone. However, I particularly wish everyone to understand that this is merely drawn from the general principles of the Word of God.</p>

let me continue this a little bit, In Genesis it states the there will be a country of unknown origins would appear, that country being the U.S.A, and that the anti-christ would arise from that nation. I honestly always thought Obama was the anti-christ, and if he wins the 2012 election not only is america fucked, but he’ll fuck the worlds economy.</p>

Just because he is the president, does not mean he has arisen to his full power yet. It’s when he announces that he is the anti-christ is when this will happen <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

It’s my belief, deal with it. I should have as much right to post my opinion as anyone else on this site without being flamed or receiving “backlash”.</p>
<p>As for the United States being in the Bible:</p>
<p>No, it is not in the Bible. However, a well known prophecy in the Bible states that Rome will be restored as the power of the world.</p>
<p>England, like the rest of Western Europe, will be under the apostate influence of Rome and the Antichrist; for there is no power faithfully protesting against this iniquity. For similar reasons, if I might venture to give an opinion (and I never think of giving one’s own thought as more than that), it is that the United States of America will be swamped into a political marsh; and as they have been hitherto a mere conglomerate from the rest of the world, especially from Europe, comprising no doubt a vast deal of skill, industry and enterprise, but also not a little of the scum and refuse of all nations; so I believe they will break up into factions of noisy primitive elements; and, after going off in boastful vaporing, will at length burst as a bubble.</p>
<p>It is a fact that there is no place in prophecy for a vast influential power, such as the American United States would naturally be, if it long so retained its cohesion. Is it conceivable that there should be such a power existing at that day without any mention of it? Can the omission be accounted except by its dissolution? Note: think of what the Rapture will do to the United States with so many caught up, and the restraining power of the Holy Spirit gone. However, I particularly wish everyone to understand that this is merely drawn from the general principles of the Word of God.<br>

<p>For which part? The part where Rome will be restored to its original glory?</p>
<p>The Roman Prince : It is in both the Old and New Testament. Daniel 7:8,20,24, he is referred to as the “little horn” coming up amid “ten horns” subduing three of the ten and taking place of power over them all. In Revelation 13, he is mentioned as “a beast out of the sea” (the sea speaks of the restless Gentiles - Rev. 17:15), with authority “given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation” (v.7).</p>
<p>Also in Revelation 17:12-13, he is seen as the political ruler of the ten kingdom empire whose ten kings “receive authority one hour as kings with the beast. These are of one mind, and they will give their power and authority to the beast.”</p>
<p>If you’d like to read more you can go to a public library and borrow the Bible or you can buy your own copy.</p>
<blockquote>Just because he is the president, does not mean he has arisen to his full power yet. It's when he announces that he is the anti-christ is when this will happen</blockquote>
<p>The Antichrist will come out of Israel and he will be a religious leader, not a political one.</p>
<p>Revelation 13:11-17.</p>

'tis true.</p>
<p>Isaiah prophesied that Israel would become a nation in a SINGLE day. Revelation chapters 1 - 3 are pretty specific. Same thing with numbers. The Bible puts a large emphasis on numbers.</p>
