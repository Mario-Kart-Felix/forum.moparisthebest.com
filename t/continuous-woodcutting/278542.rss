    <description>Using this:

[code]if(hasAxe() == true) {
cutTimer = 3;
startAnimation(2846);
addItem(1511, 1);
addSkillXP(35, 8);
sendMessage(&quot;You get some logs.&quot;);
}
if(!hasAxe()) {
sendMessage(&quot;You need an axe to cut this tree.&quot;);
}
}[/code]

(Clearly some things will have to go; I get that) How would I make it so the character kept cutting?  While loop fail, since that checks every like .000000000000000000000000000000001 seconds.  I just need it to be redone every couple seconds.  Any thoughts at all?

Thanks.</description>
