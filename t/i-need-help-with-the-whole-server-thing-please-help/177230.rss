    <title>I need help with the whole &quot;Server&quot; thing. Please help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-the-whole-server-thing-please-help/177230</link>
    <description>When I pull up the JDK Java thing (which I think is Client.Java but I&#39;m not sure) and it says to type in &quot;ctrl + H&quot; and other codes like that... But I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s suppose to do. I can&#39;t open the server I downloaded. When I click on compile.bat, a screen pops up and says, &quot; &#39;javac &#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command, operate or batch file.&quot; and when I click on runserver.bat, it says,&quot;Expection in thread &#39;main&#39; Java.Lang.NoClassDefFound error: server&quot;  I downloaded &quot;Project 16 v6&quot; and honestly, I have no idea what to do. Lol.
So please help me with this... 

[b]Thanks![/b]</description>
