    <title>Purchasing Server Hosting (Not Asking)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/purchasing-server-hosting-not-asking/332884</link>
    <description>Alright so my buddy has got a buddy with a Server company which sells Source Game Servers (CS:S, HL@DM, ETC.) and he is willing to give me some space for my RSPS. Of course I need to give him some details on what my server will take up for bandwidth.

I was hoping one would be able to give me a rough estimate on how much bandwidth one player takes up so that I can get a quote on a per player basis.

Thanks in advance.


EDIT : I do not know much about networking/dedis/etc. He says he needs to know the server load here is a message from him in steam

&lt;blockquote&gt;8:31 PM - xTcR | Kuro 黒: bandwidth is meeningless
8:31 PM - xTcR | Kuro 黒: its all about server load&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>Is all of the information I could get out of it that was useful to me. I have to know how much load the server will be on the dedi. Not what kinds of a VPS I should buy. I cannot afford such a thing.</p>

 Pretty heavy if the server is running in java

 Really?
 I am purchasing some hosting not a full dedi but my buddy is giving me hosting space on his Dedi
 He needs to know how much it'll take so he can give me a price estimate.

<p>So far I am not getting thrilling results from my questions. I have a good idea either the server will be laggy as fuck… Or it will be <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">VERY</span></span> expensive.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should just go with a $24 VPS?</p>
