              <p>as far as I know it’s not a client problem it’s the source what is messing it up I think it’s because the double click thing I added for my empty inventory but I tested it before but I think I didn’t get the hole code out so i’m going to look in to it.</p>

<p>You could add an exception underneath your Shops method where the GP is defined as currency. I don’t recommend you do this though. You should implement a system in your Shops Configuration file to read which currency which shops use. As far as the Password glitch goes, try what Clawz Fury said. Also, check your capitalization method.</p>

              <p>For the tickets check the a currency tutorial, and for the glitch check your login method (initialize(), or run()) in your Client class. This could also be a client sided fix too.</p>
