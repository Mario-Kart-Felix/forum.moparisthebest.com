    <title>RuneClickster Beta</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runeclickster-beta/44566</link>
    <description>This program is a simple client that has features such as auto-clicking macros. It was originally intended for aid in scamming but I quit runescape and so I decided to turn it into more of a client program. I still has features like the gold trick calculator (they ask for 15000 gold, u type in 15000 and it spits hout how much to subtract to get 1500. the scam pretty much just removes the last 0). It has 7 click max macros...probably detectable because the cursor just teleports to the location. You can save your macros to files and reopen them. It supports right click.

It also displays info about the current page which is very useful to detect cookies and use them to create web clients that runescape should run in.

Now remember, this is just a beta and the auto click is probably very detectable and the program may have some bugs. If you feel there is malware in this program, either scan it to relieve your fears or just don&#39;t use it. I&#39;m not gonna waste my time scanning it because I know it&#39;s legit and posting scan screens will be useless because you can claim that they aren&#39;t real.


Also, are there any coders out there who can aid me in smooth and realistic mouse movements? After hours of frustration I have decided to leave the feature out of the beta. I also would greatly appreciate it if someone could tell me how to have the mouse target colors.

[size=20pt]YOU NEED THE .NET FRAMEWORK 2.0 TO RUN THIS!!!!!!![/size]
Download the .Net Framework 2.0 (x86) from Microsoft [url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0856EACB-4362-4B0D-8EDD-AAB15C5E04F5&amp;displaylang=en]here[/url].
If you need the x64 version just click that link and scroll down and you should find it under related links.

Thanks,
Anti-Mac

EDIT:

If you really don&#39;t care if I do the virus scan here&#39;s a pic

Please leave comments so I can make it better. Programmers, I need your help figuring out how to make a cool mouse system like BenMouse so it&#39;s less detectable.

Thanks.</description>

              <p>Ok the program is probably ready for release either tonight or tomorrow night. I’m currently coding an autotyper. It is planned to act exactly like a human (making mistakes and backspacing them etc.)</p>
<p>I completely reorganized my methods and now the script engine has direct access to the methods as well as the main form.</p>
<p>The web-browser control I was using was faulty so I used a different one. The only downfall is that it takes about 1 second extra to close java. But this only occurs when you click to exit so it isn’t bad.</p>
<p>My mouse moving method has pretty much now way to change the speed…I need to fix that.</p>
<p>The mouse moving method is now on a different thread so runescape wont freeze wile the mouse is moving! The autotyper is being coded from the ground up to be on a different thread.</p>
<p>Didn’t start work on the color or picture clicker yet…</p>
<p>The script engine is about 1 fourth done</p>
<p>Thats all i can think of for now.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the support!</p>
<p>(wonderguy, pm me if you still wanna make a file format. make sure u know c# or vb however)</p>
