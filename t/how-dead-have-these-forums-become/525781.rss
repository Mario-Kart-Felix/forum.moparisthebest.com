</aside>
<p>If you have any clue what you’re doing all those features can be included by just writing the code for them. You have no idea what you’re talking about so stop trying to act like you do. vBulletin aren’t going to sue anyone for cracking a forum that they sold to a 3rd party. Get a brain and then learn to use it, then maybe you can come back and tell me your thoughts.</p>
<p>EDIT: To anyone wondering, I didn’t infract him. Myself and another mod were working through the reports and he happened to get this one.</p>

<p>You know the only reason r-s is up is because Kevy got flamed out of Mopar, also r-s is full of morons.<br>

<p>Mopar probably makes over 1k a month easily yet their still using SMF free forums ? yet rune server least has vulletin paid forums.  Also rune-server is organized a lot nicer.  Easier to find and there is a lot of nice people at r-s just saying that now I have met a lot of nice people even from my country I reside in Canada.  Yes I agree there is a lot of retards out but there is everywhere you go look at artik here bitching at everyone or vain there is always morons everywhere you go remember this</p>
<p>YOU CANNOT FIX STUPID, STUPIDITY IS NOT MEANT TO BE TOUCHED[/quote]<br>
In your logic we should use vBulletin (which btw is incredibly outdated, their code is fudgeing atrocious) which is probably the easiest software in the world to crack. Their password is hashed using MD5 for christ sake. Not to mention that just because a forum is paid that apparently means it’s better? No. SMF is much nicer software and more up-to-date. You’re just another retarded kid who thinks because something costs a couple hundred dollars that it’s better. Leave.</p>

<p>That dump? lmao rune-server has been more succuesful then mopar.  Plus it hasn’t even been out as long :L don’t get me wrong I like both</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes that dump. Rune-Server successful? Well why dont we count the real programming gurus and compare. For the short amount of time I was over at Rune-Server I would not see one person who actually knew what they were talking about when it came to programming, I seen repetitive sources over and over with very little ever added, in other words Rune-Server has always been what MoparScape is now. As for money and traffic wise, well yeah any kid gets attracted to shiny medals and badges and any spoiled little kid with mommies credit card will buy those shiny badges. But if you look over here, Moparisthebest aims for something more professional and he actually knows what he is doing compared to Kevy who left here because he was so butt hurt. If you’re looking for real success in history then MoparScape or more preferably Moparisthebest is easily the winner.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I can name about 5 servers that never advertised on mopar that have been succuesful through rune-server.  Just pointing that out there.  Also why use a SMF forums if your bringing in that much money why don’t you upgrade and give people what they want I use SMF and I am upgrading to vbulletin.  Yet I know I don’t make as much as mopar does just from adverts…[/quote]<br>
Okay I didn’t think I had to but I’ll dumb it down for you, again. What has Rune-Server ever done to contribute to RSPS history, nothing. SMF can do exactly what vBulletin can and you don’t have to pay shit all. Also “the people” who demand for looks are as I have already said, the kids who want shiny things. MoparScape serves (served) one purpose, RSPS and not shiny badges or looks. Now please, you’re fighting a losing battle and now it’s just sad because you’re making yourself look like one of those shiny demanding kids. We can probably go as far to say that MoparScape has history and Rune-Server has… shiny badges.</p>

Well said and you know what you are talking about there is a lot of individuals here who know what they are doing.  I respect them for that as well all forums have dumbasses though that’s probably a proven fact.  It’s not really that dead though.</p>

That dump? lmao rune-server has been more succuesful then mopar.  Plus it hasn’t even been out as long :L don’t get me wrong I like both<br>

Yes that dump. Rune-Server successful? Well why dont we count the real programming gurus and compare. For the short amount of time I was over at Rune-Server I would not see one person who actually knew what they were talking about when it came to programming, I seen repetitive sources over and over with very little ever added, in other words Rune-Server has always been what MoparScape is now. As for money and traffic wise, well yeah any kid gets attracted to shiny medals and badges and any spoiled little kid with mommies credit card will buy those shiny badges. But if you look over here, Moparisthebest aims for something more professional and he actually knows what he is doing compared to Kevy who left here because he was so butt hurt. If you’re looking for real success in history then MoparScape or more preferably Moparisthebest is easily the winner.[/quote]</p>
<p>I can name about 5 servers that never advertised on mopar that have been succuesful through rune-server.  Just pointing that out there.  Also why use a SMF forums if your bringing in that much money why don’t you upgrade and give people what they want I use SMF and I am upgrading to vbulletin.  Yet I know I don’t make as much as mopar does just from adverts…</p>
