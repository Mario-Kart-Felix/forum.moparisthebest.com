<p>As I said on the other post from last report. I’m a little on the edge, I don’t understand fully whats going on, but I’m sure this is within the rules. This message mainly goes out to the person who reported your post, good luck finding somebody to help you. Was looking back on this section today and realized how dead it was. I kind of want to change that because of the 5 years I have put into Moparscape. I’ll see what I can do tomorow after I have my good night sleep.</p>

<p>Haha you’ll have to come back to this post when you’re sober or w/e :3<br>
But this section is dead for a few reasons. The biggest two I could think of is 1) Not enough people helping. and 2) The questions being asked are shit. When I say ‘shit’ it’s because that’s the only way I can think to describe them. Could be a various of problems with the post. Misleading/uninformative title making it hard to deduce the issue. topic poster didn’t specify his issue or didn’t give any information on the issue (EX: said “omg i got a nullpointer help me fix” and nothing else). And then there’s the grip of posts that come into this section that don’t belong… <em>hint</em>.</p>
<p>I used to visit the section for hours on end each day… Not always at once. I’d take a peek, help a few, come back later, help some more. etc.<br>
I’ve watched it decline. The people asking for help aren’t just asking for help anymore. Most are basically asking for you to do it for them, or a step-by-step, line-by-line solution. This, to me, doesn’t show they are making an effort to solve their issue. If all I did was give the perfect step by step answer to each post. The same kids would be constantly coming back here, with more and more questions that they don’t understand, since they never learned anything from the first few times.<br>
Sure, I can explain what I did, but not all will read (I have tested this theory aplenty) it. They’ll go to the part where I say “Change this” or “remove that”, etc.</p>
<p>For anyone that reads this and uses this section for help, please understand that we’re here to <span class="bbcode-i">help</span>, not <span class="bbcode-i"> do for you</span>.<br>
[spoiler=exception]There are times where the only way to point out the answer, is to literally tell them what to do and where. Few times, but they exist.[/spoiler]</p>
<p>Hope this info helps you tabby, if you don’t already know that’s why this section is dying.</p>

<p>Well why don’t we read the descriptions of each section… Eh?</p>
<blockquote>Server Help
Got a tricky problem to solve? Ask your question and someone may be able to resolve it.</blockquote>
Nope, doesn't seem to fit...
<blockquote>Downloads
A collection of RS2 related downloads including servers, clients and other utilities.</blockquote>
Nope, not here either...
<blockquote>Development Teams
Post your development teams here.</blockquote>
Seems like you're looking for another [b]developer[/b]. Can't go wrong here..
Oh and look in the section...
[img]http://puu.sh/crmW1/5e2087fb59.png[/img]
Weird. They seem to be asking similar things like you are.
Almost as if that's what the section is for.
