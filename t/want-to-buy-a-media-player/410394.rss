    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/want-to-buy-a-media-player/410394</link>
    <description>I have $300 dollars to spend. I&#39;ve been looking into an iPod Touch (my Dad has one), but also into an Android device. Now, I don&#39;t want a fanboy thread (inb4 imminent), I just want your opinions as to why I should choose one over the other (aside from Android &gt; iOS). Things like warranties, capabilities, restrictions, etc.</description>

              <p>I have a Samsung phone and an iPod 3g as a mp3 player. I’ve had it for 2 years and so far it has done everything I ever wanted it to. The only thing I can ever complain on tbh is that whenever I needed porn the signal was kind of weak so the videos buffered kind of slow. The signal is as strong on an iPod 4g as on an iPhone 3g/4 though <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

The problem was most likely not with android,  but with the phones hardware and how well the company patched it for that phone. I had an HTC Hero that had very small lag whenever it would. I fixed this by simply installing the clockworkmod recovery then installing a custom 2.2 rom.  It ran better and had better bettry life when though it had 2.1 stock. Its all in how well it was patched,  remember that.</p>

<p>Depending on what droid products you get they can have very good built in features, I currently have one of the android phones from Virgin mobile because i couldn’t pass up their unlimited plan. It’s the LG Optimous V and has quite amazing sound quality and is wifi capable like ipods. The speaker in it is amazing and you can hear things crystal clear even in the other room. Pretty good deal for like $150</p>

<p>But see, I don’t want a table. I want something the size of a normal iPod Touch or Android phone (perhaps something slightly bigger). That’s why i was trying to make a PSP kernel. Good size, decent hardware, etc.[/quote]<br>
There are smaller tablets lol. Screen sizes go from like 5-11 inches depending on the model/make.</p>

Wait, you want a media player? Get an iPod.<br>
If you want a phone, head into the Andriod area…<br>

Android actually is not a phone-only OS if you know anything at all. Android is ran on several tablets these days.</p>

<p>But see, I don’t want a table. I want something the size of a normal iPod Touch or Android phone (perhaps something slightly bigger). That’s why i was trying to make a PSP kernel. Good size, decent hardware, etc.</p>

<p>I want an all around device. I don’t want a phone; I already have one. I want a device like an iPod Touch, or an Android device without the “phone”.</p>
<p>I even started working on a PSP kernel a while back so that I could have such a device, but quickly gave up realizing I bit off more than I could chew.</p>

              <p>I will look into my nand dump to see if it is possible to delete some language packs without affecting the phone in a bad way.  Although I believe its just translated menus.  I could very well be wrong. I can fix my phones brick from the computer so no worries there.</p>
<p>Nother reason I like Android is tge ability to install a custom recovery and firmware lol. Did both on my old HTC Hero.</p>

<p>I may sound like a fanboy (and sorry for posting) but as you are a programmer (i think?) I would suggest trying to an Android device. The SDK is free, and only requires a payment if you want a developers license for the market. As well as the fact, cracking superuser permissions on an Android device is much easier to do than an iOS device as Android is mostly open source. I really do sound like a fanboy now lmfao.</p>

<p>Those were actually some of the reasons I was looking at the Android devices. Support for multiple languages, free SDK, and a <span class="bbcode-b">MUCH</span> smaller fee for becoming a Developer. However, in supporting multiple languages, does that make the kernel more bloated? Or can you load/unload support? (ie. unload the JRE, unload the Python module, etc)</p>
<p>I (as well as many others) appreciate the open-source belief of Linux, and thus, Android. There was an article I read a few years ago about an app found from Apple that (if i recall correctly) either wiped all data, or restored the device to factory settings. No one knew why it was happening until they subpoenaed the source code from the suspected developer, and found that it was the app. If it had been open-source, then they probably would have caught it much sooner.</p>
