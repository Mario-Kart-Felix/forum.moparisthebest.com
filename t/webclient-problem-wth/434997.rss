    <title>Webclient Problem. wth?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-problem-wth/434997</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve done this before and I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s not quite working out. So I jarred my client, and that client works fine for most people, but for some people it says &quot; Cannot find main class client&quot;. However, the webclient has an issue for everyone, it gets that little red x in the top left of the screen that says error click for details. Am i uploading it wrong? Or am I doing something wrong when I jar it?
