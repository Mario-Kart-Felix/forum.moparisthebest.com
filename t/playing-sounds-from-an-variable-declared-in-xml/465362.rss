    <title>Playing sounds from an variable declared in xml</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/playing-sounds-from-an-variable-declared-in-xml/465362</link>
    <description>Title may not be clear.. but.. here goes nothing..

Base I&#39;m using is rs474/hyperion whatever floats your boat.

In my source, combat/equipment definitions are handled in xml files, with variables such as &lt;bonuses&gt;, &lt;id&gt;, &lt;maxhit&gt;.
For example, animations are defined in there, with the corresponding animation ids, it reads the id in the tags and uses it to execute the corresponding id for animation. (my guess)

I&#39;m trying to get sound to work the same way, this is all I have done for it so far.
[code]	public int parseSound(Player player) {
		npc.getCombatdefinition().getAttackSound();
		npc.getCombatdefinition().getDefendSound();
		npc.getCombatdefinition().getDeathsound();
		}[/code]
the get methods just return the int that the xml file uses to define the sound chars, but I&#39;m stumped as of how to make a sound execute from that..


Also, for animations, in the xml file it is setup like this:

[code]&lt;animation&gt;
&lt;attack&gt;&lt;int&gt;x&lt;/int&gt;&lt;/attack&gt;
&lt;/animation&gt;[/code]

Would it be more efficient to just get the sound in there, or not because that tag is defined to contain animations (For the sake of neatness), or make a tag &lt;sound&gt; and sublevel the death defend and attack ids there?


EDIT

I&#39;ve changed the method I made up a bit, making it more efficient, fixing errors, etc.
[code]
public void parseSound(Player player, Sound id) {
			getSoundDeath();
			getSoundAttack();
			getSoundDefend();
			attacksound = id;
			defendsound = id;
			deathsound = id;
			player.playSound(Sound.create(id, (byte) 1, 0));
