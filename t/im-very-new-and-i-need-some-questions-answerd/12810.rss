          <blockquote>
              <p>First off go into autospawn.cfg and you will see somthing like this:</p>
<p><code>//------NpcID---CoordX--CoordY--Height--RangeX1-RangeY1-RangeX2-RangeY2-WalkType-Descrption
spawn = 1699	2816	3462	0	2817	3463	2815	3461	2	Ghost Shopkeeper
spawn = 23	2660	3304	0	2662	3306	2658	3302	2	Knight Of Adrougne
spawn = 23	2662	3309	0	2665	3311	2660	3308	2	Knight Of Adrougne
spawn = 20	2657	3307	0	2659	3310	2653	3305	2	Paladin
spawn = 368	3263	3407	0	0	0	0	0	1	Varrock Gate Guard at Magic Shop
</code></p>
<p>Ok here is 1 of them as an example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = 522	3217	3416	0	3220	3420	3213	3411	1	Varrock General Store Shop Keeper</code></pre>
<p>Ok the “sawpn = 552” is saying to npchandler to spawn npc 522 (varrock general store keeper). 1If  you want to make your own then you can copy and paste a new line and then switch the “552” to any npc that you want (which can be found in npc.cfg).  Then the “3217” and “3416” are the Y and X cords of the spawn of the npc. If your in-game you can type ::mypos and then it will tell you your X and Y cords. 2Then you can put those in the line we are making of the cords you are standing. Next there is the “0”. This is the floor on which the npc will be standing. So if we put a “1” then it will be on the second story. 3We will add a “0” to our line. Next is the “3220” “3420” “3213” “3411”. The first 2 numbers is the X cords of where the npc will be wealking. The second 2 numbers are the Y cords of where the npc will be walking. 4For our line we will just put 4 “0” 's. Next there is the “1”. This is the walking type of the npc. 5For ours we will just put a “1”. The final thing is the description. It is helpful to make the description the name of the npc and the location of it. I.E. King Black dragon [next line] Varrock.<br>
Ok here is the examples from the numbers above:</p>
<p>1</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = 50</code></pre>
<p>2</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = 50		3217	3416</code></pre>
<p>3</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = 50		3217	3416	0</code></pre>
<p>4</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = 50		3217	3416	0	0	0	0	0</code></pre>
<p>5</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = 50		3217	3416	0	0	0	0	0	1</code></pre>
<p>6</p>
<p><code>spawn = 50		3217	3416	0	0	0	0	0	1	KBD
Varrock general store</code></p>
<p>I hope this helped. Enjoy!</p>
