        <p>I just had a brain storm out of nowhere which I think could completely stop cheating on a RS server, and I’d like to eventually implement it in MoparScape Classic.  Incidentally, it is also a system that would be fine as 100% open source.</p>
<p>You all know that what I did with RS was basically cheat, and these are the reasons I never stopped:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accounts are free and easy to make, if one gets banned, you just make another one.</li>
<li>Money/items are easy to make and transfer to other accounts, either mains or mules.</li>
<li>When banned, only items currently on the banned account got removed.</li>
</ol>
<p>With that it mind, the solution seems pretty simple, similar to a plugin I’m running on the minecraft server.  This plugin records everything a player does, every block he picks up, every block he destroys, and if a player places lava or something that flows, it tracks where it goes to and what it causes there as well.  If the staff determines a player was a bad player they can ‘rollback’ all their actions with a single command, if the player was ‘hacked’ during the time in question, they can rollback everything they did for the past X hours or whatever.</p>
<p>So here is what I have in mind, track every possible exchange of items (money is an item) in RSC, each transaction will have it’s own unique ID and the ID of the parent transaction as well, a simplified row in the database would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">id, parent_id, username, ip, date, xfer_method, item, amount, rolled_back
#playerx trades 50 gold to playery
0, null, playerx, iphere, unixtimestamp, trade, gold, 50, 0
#playery trades that 50 gold to playerz
1, 0, playery, iphere, unixtimestamp, trade, gold, 50, 0</code></pre>
<p>Etc.  Transactions would include any way items can be transferred, like if they are dropped (or looted while pking), traded to another player, sold to a shop, or wagered in a duel.  Another example of a transaction would be mining ore from a rock, or getting wood from a tree, etc etc.  Basically any time that you get or lose an item.  A transaction would also need to be recorded if, for example, iron ore was smelted into iron bars or similar, then the iron bars would be tracked or ultimately rolled back if the parent transaction was.</p>
<p>Optionally, we should also track experience points gained from using transferred items, so that could be rolled back too.</p>
<p>This is too complicated to handle in-game with chat commands, so a nice web-based front-end could be written for staff to search and handle.  Then when people are banned for cheating, you can remove all effects they had on the game with a single command, effectively removing all incentive to cheat for all players, as cheaters lose everything they ever did, even on their main, and regular players are more leary of buying obviously botted goods, as they know they will just be rolled back anyway.  As a side-effect, it can also be used to reliably detect cheating.  For example, since all rocks mined are recorded, you could run a query to determine if anyone mined, say, more than 100 iron ores per hour for more than 3 hours, no human could keep that up, so it must be a bot.</p>
<p>So, thoughts?</p>

        <p>Jagex also uses rollbacks when being caught.<br>
I like this idea, with a rollback you don’t loose everything, just the amount you botted.</p>

        <p>Jagex rolls back experience (levels), but as far as I can tell, it’s pretty much arbitrary, I don’t think they actually record a set amount or roll you back a certain time.</p>
<p>But this is more about the items, so we could continually remove ALL botted items from the economy with no manual work.</p>

        <p>This would be a gigantic pain in the ass, and would piss legit players off.</p>
<p>Player a hacks player b.  Player a then has a drop party with player b’s stuff.</p>
<p>Player a hacks player b.  Player a goes pking/staking on player b’s account and player c gets the items.</p>
<p>Player a hacks player b.  Player a sells player b’s items to the shop.  Player c buys player a’s items.</p>
<p>Etc.</p>
<p>There are so many ways to transfer items it’s insane, and there is too much potential to drastically effect legit players.  It also can be abused…</p>
<p>Player a stakes and loses a decent chunk of money.  He then starts botting non-stop and intentionally gets caught, so he is rolled back.  Player a gets rolled back, and then the other person loses the money.</p>
<p>Also, what happens when you have long chains?  Player a sells player b some botted items.  Player b sells a portion to c, d, and e.  Player c, d, and e each sell some to other players…</p>
<p>That’s a massive amount of people getting fucked over and they had absolutely no way to tell if they were originally botted, so the ‘they should be cautious of who they buy from’ argument falls apart.</p>

<p>@ originally botted, I’m talking about the general way I have sold botted goods in the past when I used to do that kind of thing.  I’d be selling 5 million cannonballs, and they guys I sold them to knew they were botted (because it would take months to do all that by hand), they even asked me if I botted them.  That type of thing, of course a small amount wouldn’t be a tip off.

        <p>Or, why not record all actions? Then create a client that can replay a set of actions for you. This way you can find out pretty much anything about any player at any time. If someone reported a player, you’d assemble this players last actions and have the client replay them. You could even use this system for statistics (if you’d like). We did just that (for the purpose of debugging and statistics) for an MMOQ-game we developed earlier.</p>

That type of thing, of course a small amount wouldn’t be a tip off.  But again, it would undo the deal like it had never happened in the first place, the buyer would know they were botted (perhaps an automatic message or PM would be in order), and they could buy legit items.[/quote]For the first bit, that’s fair enough, though I’d still be pissed as a player…</p>
<p>For the second bit, not everyone lets their bots get 5 million cannonballs; I’d say most people would get maybe 1k then reinvest their money.  Also, what happens when the items are spread throughout the community already, and people start using the items to skill.</p>
<p>Do their stats get reset, and a whirlwind of rage appears, do the transactions get reversed and you’ve essentially duped the used items if the player is unbanned, or do you ‘prorate’ the transactions because some were used?</p>
<p>[quote=“object, post:6, topic:417102”]Or, why not record all actions? Then create a client that can replay a set of actions for you. This way you can find out pretty much anything about any player at any time. If someone reported a player, you’d assemble this players last actions and have the client replay them. You could even use this system for statistics (if you’d like). We did just that (for the purpose of debugging and statistics) for an MMOQ-game we developed earlier.[/quote]That’s pretty much what I wanted to do, just more in-depth.</p>

        <p>I think you should only undo things for the offending player. If you’re undoing things that were affected by the offending player for everyone involved (even if they were just indirectly involved), a lot of people would complain, yes. But if you have the actions recorded, then just undo all actions for the offending player (on his or her account), that were recorded from the initial offence. You don’t even need a timestamp for that, because you already know what the offending actions are (otherwise you cannot do anything).</p>

        <p>When I would loot enemy clan’s member accounts, I would drop trade the items or trade normally and then call out in the middle of Varrock/Falador: “I’m quitting, someone can have my account and stuff” and inevitably someone would PM me and I would send them the password (or just shout out the password) and then log off. I would login under my regular account with that user on my friends list and see if someone else logged on as it. Jagex never caught on and my IP thus did not show up as the last “logged in” IP address when they finally did recover their account. Chat logs and friends list logs might be a good idea too.</p>
