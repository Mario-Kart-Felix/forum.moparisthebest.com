    <title>Need A Template?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-template/318478</link>
    <description>Alright, i will be willing to make a template of an item, if you are willing to tell me what you want, no guarantee i will make it, since there will be more than just one person requesting and i might miss yours. Pictures help btw. Even if its a shitty MS Paint 5 second picture, as long as it tells me in a little more detail of what you want.

NOTE - These will be made from Primitives, or have color/detail. Im only making the general shape for you to build from.</description>
