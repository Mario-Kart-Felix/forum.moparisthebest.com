    <title>Pure - Prayer or no Prayer?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pure-prayer-or-no-prayer/104539</link>
    <description>I&#39;m creating a pure right now with the following stats;

Attack 30/40
Strength 40/??
Defence 1/1
Hitpoints 34/??
Range 20/40
Mage 25/50
Prayer 1/??

Is it worth getting 31 or 33 or 43 prayer as a [b]f2p [/b] pker? I&#39;ve been wondering for a while now, and I&#39;ve already made two accounts with prayer, both were good, but kept getting owned by the same level.

Do you reckon pures should get prayer?</description>

              <p>Alrite…<br>
Stats for the best low level pures:<br>
Attack: 50<br>
Strength: 70+<br>
Def: 1<br>
Range: 60+<br>
Mage: 60+<br>
Prayer: 31! (for str prayers, and protect)<br>
You use range. then when low hp, you use a g maul, OR you use a rune scimmy and a g maul.</p>
<p>Or, this is what i did ( i don’t really advise it)<br>
Attack: 60<br>
strength: 70+<br>
def: 1<br>
range: anything<br>
mage: anything<br>
Prayer: 1</p>
<p>That last one is TERRIBLE for a pker. Because you seem to find that your being owned by maulers who have 80+ strength. And everytime you die, you loose your dds/d long/d scimmy. So then you get called a 1 itemer, then u get another wep and die.</p>
<p>So i would get 31 prayer. Then mayby when you get 70 attack+ get 52. So you can smite ect.<br>
I agree, Pures should have prayer. Apart from stakers…but you always have a temptation to go into the wildy no matter what kind of account you are!</p>
<p>Hope this helped!</p>
