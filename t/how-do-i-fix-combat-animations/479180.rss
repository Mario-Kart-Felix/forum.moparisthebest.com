    <title>How do I fix combat animations?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-fix-combat-animations/479180</link>
    <description>It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve programmed with Java and RS2 both. The main problem I&#39;ve had with any server is the disgusting combat animations. The arms fly all over the place. The models get stretched out. It looks like poop. 

Would somebody be so kind as to tell me if there is a fix for this? And if so, point me to a tutorial or tell me how to fix this problem? If it matters, the current server I&#39;m testing out is Ventonix v3(also known as TinyScape, I believe). And the client is a generic 508 IP changer client I found here on the forums.</description>

<p>You cannot fix animations without using different software. I know 3DS Max has some sort of animation thing added to it. But it also costs quite a bit.</p>

<p>Thepirate bay is a great solution to this.</p>
<p>But there is no way to fix the animation problem? From what I’ve seen over the years is that the animations are mostly correct. The only problem is that. Say you’re fighting a goblin and he swings at you. Well, I can see his hand is there. But his sword tip is still in his guard position, and the handle is in his hand near me. And the blade is now 3 feet long. His elbow is still at his side, and his forearm is 5 feet long.</p>
<p>There is truly no fix to this but download another server or client? Would the animations be client sided? A fix would be to just find a new 508, if so.</p>
