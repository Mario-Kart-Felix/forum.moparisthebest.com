    <title>Constant &#39;Error Connecting to Server&#39;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/constant-error-connecting-to-server/331349</link>
    <description>Okay, so I haven&#39;t been on Moparscape in a long time, and when I went on today, I saw Moparscape 4.0. I was like &quot;Awesome, finally!&quot; then, I waited a couple of minutes for it to load for the first time, and then,  I went File, Start server, entered a username and password, entered it, and I got Error connecting to server. 
What are some reasons that it would do this?
Any help is greatly appreciated.  :(</description>

<p>Are you entering in your IP or do you think Moparscape 4.0 is it’s own game? Well, it’s not.</p>
