    <title>Here&#39;s How I See Servers Going</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/heres-how-i-see-servers-going/473074</link>
    <description>This is just a fun little prediction I have, and I&#39;m curious to think what you think will happen to servers in the future (by servers I obviously mean RuneScape private servers). This does not include any of the newer like 6xx+ stuff.

-Soon there will be a bunch of playable RuneScape remakes. There&#39;s already Davidi2&#39;s and I believe a couple others, and there are some promising ones in the development section as well.
-Afterwards, when people can&#39;t decide which ones to play and get sick of the slow leveling, the style goes back to either the original popular wL servers like CheezScape or the DeltaScape age.
-People soon get bored of all the game&#39;s original content, and soon the expectancy is to have custom maps, NPCs, items, and the sort.
-Remakes start for the higher revisions
-317 servers/clients become obsolete

What do you think?

<p>my point is nobody is going to do a 530 remake, and if they do it would be retarded(and never completed)</p>

<p>530 Remake? That’s 2009, not even close to the current RuneScape. Also, with EoC pretty much no server is close to the current RuneScape.</p>

<p>The construct map region packet doesn’t magically make the map chunk flat, IF he did use that packet(which he didnt) it would look like the map normally does, and when you spawn another chunk next to it, they form together like so</p>

<p>However the above isn’t using the construct map region packet, it’s a custom map index, but it’s just about the same concept.</p>

<p>clearly you’ve been misinformed because that’s not even remotely close to what i’ve been fucking saying in the first place. i didn’t say there was a “packet to edit maps.” i said that maybe the first link that was posted used a packet that would normally be used for something like construction since it’s just a fucking flat plane.</p>
<p>the main thing the wanker clawz was starting a fight about was the fact that the other guy said that it’s a great map editor and then went on to contradict it. that’s it. further backed up by the fact that it’s not usable enough to the point where everyone can actually use it. i’m not saying nothing has ever been made with it, i’m saying that just about nothing has been made with it. if the map editor’s greatness is defined by the content that can be created in it then by that standard it’s not great either.</p>
<p>i’m done with this thread, full of bloody morons who can’t understand simple logic and people who get all excited at the prospect of making themselves feel better about their existence by trying so hard to insult and prove other people wrong and put words in the other person’s mouth to make their nonsense argument better in their eyes.</p>

<p>well i looked and i couldn’t find anything on your created topics list. also the “played four servers” is kind of irrelevant because it has nothing to do with that specific map editor. probably just done through that packet is supposedly used for construction. all manual.<br>

<p>nowhere does it say that they used peter’s editor, and that’s what we’re talking about. i claim that nobody has made anything in it because it’s pretty much unusable and as far as i can tell the first one is just a flat surface with a bunch of objects.</p>
<p>that could be done using that packet. i’m not saying that everyone uses it, i’m just trying to suggest that not everything is made by a “map editor” that everyone can use because if there was one then everyone would use it.</p>
