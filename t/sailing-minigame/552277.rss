The only other big problem i have right now is that the tiles show over the player when i have them change appearance to the ship im using the pnpc method i know in the client you can adjust abyte68 in entity defintions and it will adjust how many tiles the model covers but if yoj do pnpc it doeant adjust it for the player as well do you have any idea how i ca make this work?<br>

              <p>It would send the opponent to the right region and the requesting player would stay in the same region but the opponents model would populate in the right spot compared to the requesting players position but the region just would not update. I think it may be a client issue as in having two clients open locally not sure. But how i resolved it is just sending the requesting player to a different region and then to the correct one using a timer so i can shorten time just kept it a little higher so that it had time but ill adjust it.</p>

<p>Thanks for the time and criticism, yea definitely its just a prototype lol still have stuff to do but yea as far as the loading i can.make it go a little quicker just was having some technical issues with the moveplayer method, it would changeregions for some reason so had to send the player to a different region by himself then send him next to the other player.

That does sound weird indeed.<br>
So it wouldn’t just directly move them to the area?<br>
You could try making them go into a ‘lobby’ (Both/all players) area first, and then into the game area to see if it’d sync up correctly.</p>
