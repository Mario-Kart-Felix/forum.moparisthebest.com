    <title>Great job offer!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/great-job-offer/387792</link>
    <description>Today, I received this e-mail, containing a once in a lifetime opportunity(!!!):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ELS, [b]american[/b] company known worldwide as a first class [b]diller[/b] for luxury goods, is currently [b]hiring for[/b] administrative assistant/sales support representatives [b]in Netherlands[/b]. [b]This position is originally home-based[/b], so good for those looking for a [b]schedule flexible[/b] and extra cash.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Is this a new kind of e-mail scam? Further on, they ask me to send them my CV. Just looking at the spelling and grammar used in the e-mail, you can understand that this is a big pile of bullshit. But what can they do with my CV?</description>

<p>Just bolded the most apparent errors, which make it even clearer that it’s a scam. What bothers me though is the fact that I got this e-mail on my school mail address, with which I’ve never ever sent an e-mail with. How is it possible that a 3rd party found it?</p>

</aside>
<p>I got endless spam, pharmaceuticals, (fake) job offerings, offers of fake degrees, etc to my uni email literally straight away after it was created. The reason is, most universities have nice but vulnerable email setups.</p>
<p>So at manchester I had my personal email which was <a href="mailto:greenyABC@manchester.ac.uk">greenyABC@manchester.ac.uk</a></p>
<p>However, you could also email <a href="mailto:students@manchester.ac.uk">students@manchester.ac.uk</a>, firstyears@manchester.ac.yj (obs secondyears@ if i was a second year, and so on). Then there was departmental so, <a href="mailto:csstudents@manchester.ac.uk">csstudents@manchester.ac.uk</a></p>
<p>There was probably even more, but you can see how advertisers don’t actually need <span class="bbcode-b">your</span> email address, they just need one of the ones that redirects to thousands of students.</p>
<p>I’m surprised they never installed a decent mail filter  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

<p>I’m not going to respond at all. I know this is a fake. Perhaps you are right about the identity theft.</p>

<p>In the e-mail they don’t ask for any money, but they do offer €1700,- a month plus 5% bonus of the revenue I generate.</p>

<blockquote>Good day!
<p>The ELS, american company known worldwide as a first class diller for luxury goods, is currently hiring for administrative assistant/sales support representatives in Netherlands. This position is originally home-based, so good for those looking for a schedule flexible and extra cash.</p>
