    <description>hey im demonwars owner and coder of RSDW.

and does any1 know how to do these things:

1: make npcs appear in a quest without using commands or items, just like dialogue?

2: how to make npc talk to eachother with text above their heads?

3: how to make textures off .mqo/.dat or any other model file that can be converted to fit in a 508 client (im asking this to make the weps and armor more detailed)

any1 who can help me wif this will recieve exclusive info about the v2.5 every month and get a special rank in the game when it is good enough to put to online play
