    <title>Is this exactly Possible?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-this-exactly-possible/48765</link>
    <description>I dont always have an active internet connection,
I can run a LAN netowrk though through numerous computers.
Am i able to run an offline or LAN version of Moparscape Or something along the same lines?
I would just like to do this while NOT connected to the internet,
Such as Dueling my friends on LAN etc. 
If this is possible can somebody help me out???
Thanks,
Matty</description>
