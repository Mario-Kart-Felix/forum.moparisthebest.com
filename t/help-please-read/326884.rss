    <description>Alright everyone thanks for reading. Now so far, I&#39;ve created a No-Ip account, downloaded No-Ip DUC, created a host and port forwarded.
I checked if my ports were forwarded with the port checker tool and they are.
Now i&#39;m using my other computer to try and log on, and running the server from this computer. I changed the IP my client connects to in Gui.java.
But it doesn&#39;t let me connect. What&#39;s wrong?? Do I need to restart my computer?
Please reply.</description>
