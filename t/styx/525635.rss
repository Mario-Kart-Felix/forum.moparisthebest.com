Repository Link: https://code.google.com/p/styx/source/browse/Styx+Framework/
[/center]

     Styx is a NIO founded framework which I have high hopes for. I finally decided to work out a repository to hopefully get some criticism on the current code. I&#39;m not going to go into listing all the features since you&#39;ll have a pretty good idea of my progress based on the repository. I&#39;ll provide media as soon as I have something worth depicting since the only feature as of now is connection accepting.

     I hope to develop this framework to the point where I can host it as an oldschool server. I don&#39;t plan to attempt emulating RuneScape itself, but instead to emulate the original MoparScape servers and implement well written content. (Home being the eastern Varrock bank)

    I would appreciate any critiques or corrections which can be left in the comments. You can act like a dick while correcting me if you feel so inclined I don&#39;t care, as long as there&#39;s logic behind what you say and it could better the project.

    This project will be open source until after player updating has been finished. This will be a fair amount of time as I would prefer to have all my code in top shape before the link is removed.

Update Log:

[code]
Posted project thread.

Began on a protocol decoding system. Both packets and login will be derived from one super class.

Began constructing the proper systems to begin login decoding.

On Ryley&#39;s recommendation began looking into NIO Design patterns.

Continued researching while I began optimization on my current code.

Created a queue for connections pending login decryption.

Split my initial main class into two separate ones: NetServer &amp; NetSelector.

Removed the ChannelBuffer class.

The NetSelector is now executed with the ScheduledExecutorService.

Began breaking up my classes into smaller and more purposeful classes.

Created an EventHandler to handle the three actions received from the selector.

Connection acception has been completed and is queued when received. It will be removed from the queue and moved when the login process is completed.

Began sketching out some primitive design ideas.

Implemented a new design. NetworkSelector -&gt; NetworkEvent -&gt; NetworkEvent handler where the event sent by the selector is handled.

Cleaned up my code and provided basic documentation.

Updated the repository.

Modified my code style to look neater in the repo.

Updated the repository.

Small bug fixes. Relating to connections.

Thread updated. (Besides Update Log)

Re-factored two classes an began cleaning and organizing the others.

Documented my variables.

Re-named the main class after the application title.

Very small amount of cleaning done.

Began plotting an implementation of the ByteBuffer.

Began implementing an Input-Output system to begin on login decryption. Connections are now stored in a Queue before decryption and now it&#39;s set to one connection per address.
[/code]

<p>This is not mandatory, but I hate it when the inferred type arguments are not used properly (by properly I mean when unconstrained type arguments are left raw or when they infer &lt;?&gt;) You should instead use:</p>

Iterator&lt;SelectionKey&gt; ...</code></p>
<p>again, not mandatory but just my way of doing things, it is easier on the eyes when reading code, when I see SelectionKey as the type argument I am like “Oh, an Iterator over selection keys” rather than “Oh, an Iterator over some class, oh, now I see an Iterator over SelectionKey’s”</p>
<p>on to this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">while (true)</code></pre>
<p>I see these are very misleading and confusing, I would definitely look for an alternative, you do not need an infinite loop.<br>
What I mean by this is to use some resources within your class that provide when to execute to loop and when to stop it.</p>
<p>For example in NIO I tend to do this:</p>

<p>Well, since you’re using NIO and the current implementation looks pretty standard (like rewritten RuneSource) not saying you did, but that is what it looks like, I would suggest looking into <a href="https://code.google.com/p/naga/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Naga</a>, it is a simplified wrapper library for NIO and basic IO (also has support for the asynchronous counterparts!) Also, instead of jamming your NIO code inside your main class I’d suggest looking into some more design patterns to implement that code in a more readable and OO fashion. On another note you don’t seem to have any prewritten planning or design behind your logic it seems to me you are just writing as you go and optimizing as you see necessary – this is a bad way to approach a design, especially with a server. You should definitely take some sit downs and write some pseudo-code or a typed/written project hierarchy and see the flow of your designs before actually programming them.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks i’ll look into Naga, and your right. Until I get the basics done im writing as I go. Once the base is done I plan to go back and optimize where i see fit. Then once I get to more intricate designs I plan to have a sit down and work them out. As I have been doing with an entity system for the past ten minutes. Also I haven’t opened another server since I began this project. I want this to be completely my work, even if that means I have to spend more time on it. I would rather learn from my mistakes then get it right on the first try with somebody else’s code. Thanks you for the comment <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>EDIT: July 20th [11:34] Numerous improvements and changed made. Check the update log.</p>
<p>EDIT: July 20th [12:15] Large amount of revising has been done. Primitive Event system put in place to handle the possible selector actions. Check the update log for more.</p>

<pre><code> Styx is a NIO founded framework which I have high hopes for. I finally decided to work out a repository to hopefully get some criticism on the current code. I'm not going to go into listing all the features since you'll have a pretty good idea of my progress based on the repository. I'll provide media as soon as I have something worth depicting since the only feature as of now is connection accepting.

 I hope to develop this framework to the point where I can host it as an oldschool server. I don't plan to attempt emulating RuneScape itself, but instead to emulate the original MoparScape servers and implement well written content. (Home being the eastern Varrock bank)

I would appreciate any critiques or corrections which can be left in the comments. You can act like a dick while correcting me if you feel so inclined I don't care, as long as there's logic behind what you say and it could better the project.

This project will be open source until after player updating has been finished. This will be a fair amount of time as I would prefer to have all my code in top shape before the link is removed.

<p>Update Log:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Posted project thread.

Began on a protocol decoding system. Both packets and login will be derived from one super class.

Began constructing the proper systems to begin login decoding.

On Ryley's recommendation began looking into NIO Design patterns.

Continued researching while I began optimization on my current code.

Created a queue for connections pending login decryption.

Split my initial main class into two separate ones: NetServer &amp; NetSelector.

Removed the ChannelBuffer class.

The NetSelector is now executed with the ScheduledExecutorService.

Began breaking up my classes into smaller and more purposeful classes.

Created an EventHandler to handle the three actions received from the selector.

Connection acception has been completed and is queued when received. It will be removed from the queue and moved when the login process is completed.

Began sketching out some primitive design ideas.

Implemented a new design. NetworkSelector -&gt; NetworkEvent -&gt; NetworkEvent handler where the event sent by the selector is handled.

Cleaned up my code and provided basic documentation.

Updated the repository.

Modified my code style to look neater in the repo.

Updated the repository.

Small bug fixes. Relating to connections.

Thread updated. (Besides Update Log)

Re-factored two classes an began cleaning and organizing the others.

Documented my variables.

Re-named the main class after the application title.

Very small amount of cleaning done.

Began plotting an implementation of the ByteBuffer.

Began implementing an Input-Output system to begin on login decryption. Connections are now stored in a Queue before decryption and now it's set to one connection per address.</code></pre>
