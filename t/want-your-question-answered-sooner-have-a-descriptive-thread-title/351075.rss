    <title>Want your question answered sooner? Have a descriptive thread title!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/want-your-question-answered-sooner-have-a-descriptive-thread-title/351075</link>
    <description>I noticed lately that it&#39;s worse than ever before.

Thread titles like &#39;HELP!&#39;, &#39;Coding&#39;, &#39;PLZZ!&#39;, &#39;HURRY IMPORTANT!&#39;, &#39;NEED ANSWER QUICK&#39; are not acceptable. If you want the right people (that know what they&#39;re doing) to answer your post, give them some information so that they know what the thread is about before clicking on it. If I know how to add a pvp box, and your question is that, but your thread title is &#39;HELP!&#39;, chances are I will not even look at your thread, and you lost the possible answer right there. However if your thread title is &#39;How do I add a PVP Box?&#39;, I can look at it, say &#39;I know how to do this!&#39; and reply to your thread with the answer.

Summary:
  Please make your thread titles more specific.

PS - This is in addition to [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,375275.0.html]this post[/url], which talks about having descriptive questions inside your threads.</description>

<p>But either way, people aren’t listening to the rule. I think the staff should make it easier to see (I mean seriously, not many people read all of the rules) or start enforcing it.</p>

              <p>I noticed lately that it’s worse than ever before.</p>
<p>Thread titles like ‘HELP!’, ‘Coding’, ‘PLZZ!’, ‘HURRY IMPORTANT!’, ‘NEED ANSWER QUICK’ are not acceptable. If you want the right people (that know what they’re doing) to answer your post, give them some information so that they know what the thread is about before clicking on it. If I know how to add a pvp box, and your question is that, but your thread title is ‘HELP!’, chances are I will not even look at your thread, and you lost the possible answer right there. However if your thread title is ‘How do I add a PVP Box?’, I can look at it, say ‘I know how to do this!’ and reply to your thread with the answer.</p>
<p>Summary:<br>
Please make your thread titles more specific.</p>
<p>PS - This is in addition to <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,375275.0.html" data-bbcode="true">this post</a>, which talks about having descriptive questions inside your threads.</p>
