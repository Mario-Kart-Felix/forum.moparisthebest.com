    <description>Hey everybody I&#39;m new here, and I was just wondering if I can do something. I was searching for a gaming forum on google and came across this site. I have made a FPS (first person shooter) orpg and I was wondering if it would be ok to post it on this site. I know this is for RuneScape, but I also saw a general programming and this section. Is this ok? Please get back to me. Thanks everybody.</description>

Thank you :). I am not the only developer though so is it okay if I add their names on here also even though they are not part of this community?<br>

Eeh, just say they are your friends, not many people here will probably recognize them.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks coonhunter. We are an aspiring gaming team so most likely you havent heard of us. Later on once I talk to the rest of the team I will post a video and some pix.</p>

              <p>Yes, you can post it here. If it is something you are programming onto, or are editing, you can put it into the “General Programming” board, or if its just something you want to talk about, use the “General Discussion” board.</p>
