<p>donate money to a server they cannot freely play.[/quote]rep++[quote=“Davidi2, post:885, topic:391852”]Specifically, asking for donations for a game nobody can even play yet. And then forcing them to pay in order to play prebetaomegaalpha or whatever, I don’t see how that’s different than having to buy membership.</p>

<p>I had asked for my website to be approved multiple times in the past and none of you moderators decided to care. That’s called ignorance right there. Riddle me this. How can a website with 60,000+ members <span class="bbcode-b">NOT </span>be approved? You must’ve been on drugs when you locked that thread.</p>
<p>I demand it to be approved and re-opened.</p>

<p>Nowhere on any of your sites do you support MoparScape, and I just took a look around your site, and you ended up making your own RSPS community?<br>

<blockquote>Over the past week I've been working on creating a RuneScape private server community where you can discuss, download, share tutorials, ask for help, and learn how to create your very own RuneScape private server!
<p>If you’ve ever been interested in programming (or coding as some of you call it), or you already program, this is definitely a great place to learn and extend your knowledge of several programming languages, the big one being Java.</p>
<p>There are a several large communities like this, but not nearly as organized or as professional as RuneBit is, so we’re hoping this will become the most well known place to discuss and learn how to program RuneScape private servers.</p>
<p>Click the following link to go to the RuneBit home page, and make sure to sign up on the forums to start making your very own RuneScape private server:</p>

<p>Yea… my vote would be we just censor your sites completely for using MoparScape as free advertising. I’ll ask Silab what she think.s I also reported your youtube channel to <a href="mailto:copyright@jagex.com">copyright@jagex.com</a> for giggles, I have no clue if they actually look at that stuff though.</p>
