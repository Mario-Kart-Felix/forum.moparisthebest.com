    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rs2006-bringing-back-the-good-ol-days/391852</link>
    <description>[quote=&quot;RSVault&quot;]You do realize that RS2006 has 60,000+ members? You do realize it&#39;s the biggest RSPS in ages to ever hit RSPS? You do realize that my server has brought tons of attention to MoparScape? You do realize that my server has increased revenue from ads from MoparScape? You do realize that your decision was completely ignorant?

I had asked for my website to be approved multiple times in the past and none of you moderators decided to care. That&#39;s called ignorance right there. Riddle me this. How can a website with 60,000+ members [b]NOT [/b]be approved? You must&#39;ve been on drugs when you locked that thread.

I demand it to be approved and re-opened.

Vault.[/quote]

I demand you refund all the people you force to donate to play your shitty server. once you show me the paypal logs I will consider allowing your site to be approved.


[quote=&quot;RSVault&quot;]Honestly, I&#39;m not forcing anyone to pay for pre-alpha you dumb shit. Read about my server before you say ignorant crap like that. NO ONE has ever had a remake that&#39;s become this big, and therefor little minds like you don&#39;t know how to handle things like this, you dumb shit. For the stability test we let everyone on, I&#39;m guessing you didn&#39;t know about that either because your an ignorant bitch, right? Exactly. Don&#39;t say shit without knowing what you&#39;re talking about. It seems like you&#39;re just after the money made from RS2006, which by the way, all of it goes towards the server. I requested my website to approved several times before, but you half-brained, ignorant moderators don&#39;t give a single shit, so don&#39;t go around spreading crap and locking the best project to ever hit moparscape or RSPS.

Dumb shit.[/quote]

This makes you look really good :)</description>

<p>donate money to a server they cannot freely play.[/quote]rep++[quote=“Davidi2, post:885, topic:391852”]Specifically, asking for donations for a game nobody can even play yet. And then forcing them to pay in order to play prebetaomegaalpha or whatever, I don’t see how that’s different than having to buy membership.</p>

<p>Nowhere on any of your sites do you support MoparScape, and I just took a look around your site, and you ended up making your own RSPS community?<br>

<blockquote>Over the past week I've been working on creating a RuneScape private server community where you can discuss, download, share tutorials, ask for help, and learn how to create your very own RuneScape private server!
<p>If you’ve ever been interested in programming (or coding as some of you call it), or you already program, this is definitely a great place to learn and extend your knowledge of several programming languages, the big one being Java.</p>
<p>There are a several large communities like this, but not nearly as organized or as professional as RuneBit is, so we’re hoping this will become the most well known place to discuss and learn how to program RuneScape private servers.</p>
<p>Click the following link to go to the RuneBit home page, and make sure to sign up on the forums to start making your very own RuneScape private server:</p>

<p>Yea… my vote would be we just censor your sites completely for using MoparScape as free advertising. I’ll ask Silab what she think.s I also reported your youtube channel to <a href="mailto:copyright@jagex.com">copyright@jagex.com</a> for giggles, I have no clue if they actually look at that stuff though.</p>

500 people were on spread out over the entire world. When people did ::home, nobody could stay logged in for more than a minute. Seems to me that if you did anything at all you would freeze up and crash. Pre-Alpha is going to be a huge let-down and a lot of “donators” are going to be very disappointed. I am not surprised Vault.</p>

<p>He never came up with it you jackass, the first rs remake was OS Remake and the one after that was RS-Reborn. He hasn’t “come up” with anything. Do you know rs2007? It failed miserably. You might say, “Oh there were a lot of people logging in on one place,” That’s bullshit. He leeched PJA and then offered to pay somebody with money that he received from donators, but when that person rejected, Vault had no choice but to host it and hope for the best. Obviously the server couldn’t handle the players and Vault shut down, taking the donator’s money with him.</p>
<p>I don’t think you understand what ignorant means. The ignorant community blindly spammed two R-S mods because Vault said he was banned. They all spammed unban Vault but neither Scu11 nor Santa has the power to unban. Therefore, the community is ignorant, or lacking of knowledge.</p>
<p>That bullshit you read on rs2006 is completely useless<br>

That’s unfortunate if it’s true. Do you have any proof?[/quote]</p>
<p>For which part? The one where he leeched the source and then tried to pay a programmer?  Scully has a pic of Vault attempting to pay for full combat.</p>

<p>So there is this guy who pays for his content, and this guy who creates his own unique content. Now this guy who recreates a certain time area on a common game is buying his content, and the guy who makes UNIQUE content who writes his own. Who do you think lasts longest? The unique guy! Zing! How is this funny? Cause the truth hurts/is funny</p>
