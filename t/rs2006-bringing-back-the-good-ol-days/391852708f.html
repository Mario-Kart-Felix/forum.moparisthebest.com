Specifically, asking for donations for a game nobody can even play yet.

<p>A donation to find bugs and report them for 1 month. When we opened RS2007 it was too hectic allowing everyone on to test bugs. This way we have a smaller group of people (987) to do the testing.<br>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>We have a great bug reporting system. We just don’t want the THOUSANDS of people we’re expecting to log on and a lot of them thinking (even though I mention it hundreds of times) that accounts won’t be reset, where as in fact they will. I’ve learned my mistakes from RS2007, and this is how it’s going to work. And plus, $1? Really? You can find that on the ground any day.</p>
<p>Also, pre-alpha is a bug testing period. That’s how we’ve advertised it since we brought in the idea. It’s 1 month long. For those who don’t wish to join pre-alpha, 1 month really isn’t all that long. And it’s better than logging into a (possibly) bug-infested version of the game, which I think is highly unlikely with the level of programming that is in RS2006.[/quote]So the difference between people that pay and the people that don’t, in terms of how well they will understand that accounts will be reset, is? If anything, you’re screwing yourself even more, because if someone donated to play earlier, they will probably feel even more entitled to keep their character.</p>
<p>[quote=“Vexillum, post:900, topic:391852”]I respect that and I think you do have a point. It wouldn’t be very nice having tons of people logging on not even doing what they’re there for.[/quote]Same question to you. What is the difference between people that pay to play pre-alpha and the others that would be logging in? Again, if anything, these people are paying to try and play earlier, not paying so they can report bugs.</p>
<p>All in all, you’re better off getting a larger sample size, instead of worrying about how many people are playing. Because what they are doing or if they expect to keep their character has nothing to do with if they donated or not.</p>

<p>Why not just have a group of about ten people go around and test all the functional features at first. Then have the public come on and play to try and identify bugs that the ten people missed?</p>
<p>David why are you going back and forth with him, it’s his server and the way he would like to handle things is up to him. He’s not going to change the way he is handling bug testing just because you think it is immoral to make people pay for something when you can consider it a good marketing strategy. Given the man is a scam artist, no offense.</p>

<p>It really doesn’t matter. Go back to your persuasive talk o’swami. Never said you were flaming, was more or less trying to push you in the direction of maybe it is a waste of time to keep trying to convince someone who seems to have his mind pretty set in what he wants to do. That’s all.</p>

        <p>I find it pointless having to pay for a time where you can play to tell the programmers the bugs to fix in all honesty…</p>
<ol>
<li>Several members of this community by itself could give you a list of bugs to fix on a daily basis easily.</li>
<li>Everybody knows I am the god of finding bugs xD</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Making people pay to play early  only for them to lose the account cause it’s resetting is a pretty bad deal. ($1 is a lot of money to some people)</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, I do have a question for you…</p>
<p>Will those who played in prealpha get a complete reset, meaning, all usernames will be resetted?</p>

[/quote]What? Who said anything about what your project was about? I was simply voicing my opinion at how you’ve run it so far. Whether it’s a remake or a normal RSPS. Specifically, asking for donations for a game nobody can even play yet. And then forcing them to pay in order to play prebetaomegaalpha or whatever, I don’t see how that’s different than having to buy membership.</p>

</aside>
<p>We have a great bug reporting system. We just don’t want the THOUSANDS of people we’re expecting to log on and a lot of them thinking (even though I mention it hundreds of times) that accounts won’t be reset, where as in fact they will. I’ve learned my mistakes from RS2007, and this is how it’s going to work. And plus, $1? Really? You can find that on the ground any day.</p>
<p>Also, pre-alpha is a bug testing period. That’s how we’ve advertised it since we brought in the idea. It’s 1 month long. For those who don’t wish to join pre-alpha, 1 month really isn’t all that long. And it’s better than logging into a (possibly) bug-infested version of the game, which I think is highly unlikely with the level of programming that is in RS2006.<br>
[/quote]So the difference between people that pay and the people that don’t, in terms of how well they will understand that accounts will be reset, is? If anything, you’re screwing yourself even more, because if someone donated to play earlier, they will probably feel even more entitled to keep their character.</p>
<p>[quote author=Vexillum link=topic=489018.msg3898784#msg3898784 date=1327552976]<br>
I respect that and I think you do have a point. It wouldn’t be very nice having tons of people logging on not even doing what they’re there for.<br>
[/quote]Same question to you. What is the difference between people that pay to play pre-alpha and the others that would be logging in? Again, if anything, these people are paying to try and play earlier, not paying so they can report bugs.</p>
<p>All in all, you’re better off getting a larger sample size, instead of worrying about how many people are playing. Because what they are doing or if they expect to keep their character has nothing to do with if they donated or not.[/quote]</p>
<p>There is no difference. Its just that there are a lot of people supporting this and if he let ANYONE log on then there would be a  lot of people and it would make it harder on him.</p>

        <p>RSVault, you should just admit to the fact you require money to fund the updates you pay people to do for you and to make it worth while for yourself as there is a financial motive.<br>
Its a lot better than trying to cover it up.</p>
<p>Eventually the hype will die if you don’t release it soon as free you will only be left with your paying customer base which will eventually die out(I have no idea when your releasing it so this may be invalid).<br>
Take a leaf out of the real Runescapes books/any other game. If you started a year ago and it was no where near ready you should have kept publicity to a low so when you were near ready you could generate the amazing support you have now rather than let it die of slowly.</p>
<p>I’ve seen a lot of constructive critism aimed at you(not from myself of course till this post) and your not taking any of it on board. Your not a genius, you can’t honestly think your doing everything right so maybe try some of it out. Theres a reason why Rs2007 failed and thats not cause of other factors, its cause of you making bad decisions.<br>

<p>Then go try and remake RuneScape.<br>
[/quote]What? Who said anything about what your project was about? I was simply voicing my opinion at how you’ve run it so far. Whether it’s a remake or a normal RSPS. Specifically, asking for donations for a game nobody can even play yet. And then forcing them to pay in order to play prebetaomegaalpha or whatever, I don’t see how that’s different than having to buy membership.</p>

<p>A donation to find bugs and report them for 1 month. When we opened RS2007 it was too hectic allowing everyone on to test bugs. This way we have a smaller group of people (987) to do the testing.<br>
[/quote]How about just design a better bug reporting system rather than making people pay for it…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>We have a great bug reporting system. We just don’t want the THOUSANDS of people we’re expecting to log on and a lot of them thinking (even though I mention it hundreds of times) that accounts won’t be reset, where as in fact they will. I’ve learned my mistakes from RS2007, and this is how it’s going to work. And plus, $1? Really? You can find that on the ground any day.</p>
<p>Also, pre-alpha is a bug testing period. That’s how we’ve advertised it since we brought in the idea. It’s 1 month long. For those who don’t wish to join pre-alpha, 1 month really isn’t all that long. And it’s better than logging into a (possibly) bug-infested version of the game, which I think is highly unlikely with the level of programming that is in RS2006.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Why not just have a group of about ten people go around and test all the functional features at first. Then have the public come on and play to try and identify bugs that the ten people missed?</p>
<p>David why are you going back and forth with him, it’s his server and the way he would like to handle things is up to him. He’s not going to change the way he is handling bug testing just because you think it is immoral to make people pay for something when you can consider it a good marketing strategy. Given the man is a scam artist, no offense.[/quote]</p>
<p>10 people is far too little.</p>
