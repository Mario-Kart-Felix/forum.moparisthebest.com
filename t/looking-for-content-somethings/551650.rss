    <description>[u]Sorry, very difficult to describe what I mean in a short title:[/u]

[i][b]What is this?![/b][/i]
Your role would involve basically playing through/testing a progression path through the server, giving feedback mainly on elements of:
How things interact with each other and how they inter-link together
Any un-even aspects/spikes/walls in progression
How well story is imbued into the actions of the character/things interacted with
And possibly together brainstorming new mechanics and such.

And possibly some simple playtesting when new mechanics are implemented.
Would prefer someone who&#39;s available between the hours of 14:00 and 21:00 GMT.

[i][b]What is the server:[/b][/i]
From Dust to Dragons 3, PvM only server. I am the only coder/developer/creator/host of it and the source I use is so heavily modified that I decided to name it: Katana. I know it like the back of my hand and fixes can be performed before you even finished describing them.

[i][b]About myself:[/b][/i]
I usually update certain aspects of the server; usually the content I create is drafted up and finished off/adjusted through rapid iteration. Sometimes, however... either due to tiredness or some other factor I&#39;ll start doing some rapid iteration on mechanics that were perfectly functional... Usually with the attempt to optimize them... Yes. Good.

[i]Notes:[/i]
There will be a bit of repetition involved, you have to be honest with your criticisms and so on and so forth.
