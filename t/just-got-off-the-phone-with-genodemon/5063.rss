    <description>I have never written a scar script. Even thou i made a scar script obfuscator.

We bascially argued about what functions are needed.  Bascailly I was trying to avoid writting code.

I need your input about color recognition functions.

Functions done:
boolean equalRGB(RGB rgb1, RGB rgb2, int redTolerance, int greenTolerance, int blueTolerance)
boolean equalRGB(RGB rgb1, RGB rgb2, int globaltolerance)
RGB getRGB(int x, int y, int maxAgeInMillisecs)
RGBXY[] findRGBXYs(int[][][] pixelArray, int red, int green, int blue, int redTolerance, int greenTolerance, int blueTolerance, Rectangle bounds)
int[][][] getPixelArray(int maxAgeInMillisecs)

I know the ones done are simple and will change greatly as i learn more.
I am recycling arrays and color grabs to improve efficenty thru asking a max age in millisecounds

Basically

Just got off the phone with GenoDemon and I agreed on:
-   Bitmaps instead being a 2 dimensional RGB array.  A converter option built into our color viewer.
    -   nulls can be inserted into the array and are ingnored in the search thus we can search for a object with a any shape instead of a recatangle
    -   A yellow Disk can be searched for, the number 3, ect.
    -   Tolerance?
-   BitMask function
    -   mark says these are used to find text.
-   Changed Pixel function, basically takes the current image and compares it to one in the future which dependentant on a wait in the function.  Then based on the changed pixles it does a color search? or bitmap search??
-  sorting functions based on distance to a pixel..
-  color spiral x,y , rect bounds

All functions have seperate tolerance support for red, green, blue.
Ability to return all matches and set how many matches to return?

I need your input.  I know most everyone thinks i am reinventing the wheel.  Scar scripts are one thread.  This system is 3 threads, 1 script, 1 random, 1 event queing thread.  A script or random does not have to wait while the mouse is moving, infact they can check to make sure the target has not moved and if it has moved they can re-direct.  This sytem shorten the development time of script.  This system provides color searching abilities that are non-existant in scar.  This sytem dosn&#39;t use your mouse.

Thus far i have developed it all myself, looking for anyone intresting in writing methods.

[code]
protected XY findXYpiral(int[][] colorArray2d, int x, int y, RGB rgb,
			int redTolerance, int greenTolerance, int blueTolerance,
			Rectangle bounds)

protected XY[] findXYs(int[][] colorArray2d, Rectangle bounds,
			int[][] bitmapArray2d, int redTolerance, int greenTolerance,
			int blueTolerance) {
[/code]
First one searches the client inside the Rectangle in a spiraling pattern from the x,y coordinate specified.  Spirals out from that coordinate looking for the RGB specified within the tolerances specified.  Thus you can start in a corner for instances and still spiral out and ignore what is not in the rectangle.

Second one searchs the client inside the Rectangle for a  bitmapArray2d (bitmap) with each color are iun the x,y in the array falling with-in the tolerances specified.  If a coordiante in the bitmapArray2d is -1, it signals a wildcard, thus any shape is possible e.g. a circle.</description>

<p>Does it work just like SCAR, so it works on other games too, or only for RuneScape?</p>
<p>Keep the good work up!</p>
<p>((Even though a bit off topic, I am sorry  :o)</p>
