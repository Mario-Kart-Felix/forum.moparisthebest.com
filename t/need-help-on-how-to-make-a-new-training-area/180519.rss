    <title>Need help on how to make a new training area</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-on-how-to-make-a-new-training-area/180519</link>
    <description>I have a Project Czar based server, and i wanted to make a new training area with NPCs. I looked, but i couldn&#39;t figure out how to add NPCs and make them attackable, have them drop certain items, how high they hit, what their hp is, how to put them in a certain spot, respawn times, etc.

If anyone knows how to do this on a Project Czar server and can tell me in a Tutorial type answer or give me a link to a Tutorial on it I would be thankful.</description>

<p>austin heres what you gotta do, to add an npc you need to open up the file “autospawn.cfg” inside it will probably looks a bit scary at first to the average noob but if you know what your doing its ok, its advisable to jsut copy one of the lines form the inside of the file jsut paste it in and change the stuff about. all the directions to all the numbers is right at the top of the file so its kidna self explanatory. for the npc drops you should fine a tutorial somewhere in the tutorials section, it shouldnt be hard to find Niall_'s tut list. to make an npc attackable jsut make sure its an npc with an attack option on it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
