    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/magic-on-update-78-help-xero-please-or-anyone-who-knows/9566</link>
    <description>If Xero can help me with this would be nice, but I just need the help.
I need to get the magic to work on cheezscape 78 Moderan and Anceint BOTH I&#39;ll give for the codes (or a source with the codes already in it) and an additional 500k if theres a little tut and explantion of how it work.

With graphics (and projectiles: 2mill, 1 mill if without graphics)

I AM NOT BUYING, It will be a small token of reward for helping me :p :)

I&#39;ve tried almost everything I could think of, but it&#39;s still messed up</description>
