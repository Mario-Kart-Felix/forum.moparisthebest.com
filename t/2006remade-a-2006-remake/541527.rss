    <title>2006Remade - A 2006 Remake!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2006remade-a-2006-remake/541527</link>
    <description>Hello people, a LONG time before, when 2006Scape just got shutdown. Me and Mod Tom (or Tom Doyle) were creating this 2006 remake! Just me and him. After awhile it became moderately popular and he hired more qualified people, and ofcourse, fired me.
However since before it had all those other qualified people, we were developing through DropBox. My DropBox to be specific, and I still have a very early version of the source and client (only a few quests added). To this surprise I started getting passionate into server developing again, and realised how 2007 Runescape is going to change pretty soon. Long story short I am developing the server again!
The original thread which Tom Doyle posted: [url=http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-server/advertise/476026-2006remade-2006-runescape-remake.html]http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-server/advertise/476026-2006remade-2006-runescape-remake.html[/url]

Website: [url=http://2006remade.ifhost.net/index.php]http://2006remade.ifhost.net/index.php[/url]

Note: This is going to be a FULL 2006 server, but at the time of the source and client we were just almost opening it up to the public for Pre-Alpha.
So maybe next week or even TOMORROW depending on how fast I develop it.
