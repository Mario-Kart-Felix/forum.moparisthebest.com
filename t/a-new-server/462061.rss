    <title>A New Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-new-server/462061</link>
    <description>I just finished my last project, a rework of hybrid pvp, a few days ago. It has all dupes fixed, better shops, no bugs, less client load time, etc. I might release it soon.

ON TOPIC: Since I finshed, I&#39;ve been wanting to start a new project. What I&#39;m looking for is a PI similar to hybrid pvp with like...epicurus level graphics. That includes proper claw models etc. Preferably, the source would be totally cleaned except for that. Can any of you throw me some suggestions? It will be an economy server.


EDIT: Also, I&#39;d prefer 126 combat level and no summoning or dungeoneering added. Slots in the skill tab are okay but since no 317 has really perfected a system, I dont want to leave sloppy sh** in the server.</description>
