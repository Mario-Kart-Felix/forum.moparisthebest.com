    <title>Logging in to Mopar Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/logging-in-to-mopar-problem/102437</link>
    <description>Hey, I downloaded all the client stuff for MoparScape 3.2 w/Aryan and it loads fine. But when I try to log in, I click Start Server. It says server created blah blah tells me to go login. So I click &quot;enter&quot; and type in a random name and pass, with a server IP of 127.0.0.1 (the default one). Then it says &quot;error connecting to server, must be down. Go create one and log in&quot;. So I repeated the cycle several times with the same results.

Then I noticed down in the black box it said &quot;Server: Error: Unable to startup listener on 43594 - port already in use?&quot;

I don&#39;t know what a port is all I know is that it has to be open to play RuneScape (the original game). So can someone please tell me how to open this port or do whatever I need to do to log in? Thanks.[br][size=1]Posted on: May 29, 2007, 03:30:36 PM[/size][hr]Nobody knows how to open a port here? Sounds relatively simple...come on!</description>
