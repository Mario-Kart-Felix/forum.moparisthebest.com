    <description>ok this isn&#39;t for me. but my friend is having troubles forwarding his belkin F5D7230-4 router and i have been trying to help. i figured out he needed to go to the virtual ip menu to do so. i told him what to put and everything. I&#39;m pretty sure everything is correct. and he applies changes and i tried to connect but it says there is an error connecting? can anyone tell me what he needs to do? what the error is?</description>
