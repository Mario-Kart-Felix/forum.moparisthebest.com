    <title>Andre Gravelle pulled over for driving with no lights on</title>

    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;A man pulled over by police last night for driving without headlights turned out to be a suspended driver.

Police say that suspended driver is 45-year-old Andre Gravelle, a well known Hamilton crime boss.

He&#39;s been charged with 4 counts of breaching his recognizance and police say he was carrying a small amount of marijuana at the time of last night&#39;s traffic stop.

Gravelle is being held in Hamilton while police in Halifax make the trip here to take him into custody.

Gravelle and his brothers were charged in a 15 million dollar Nova Scotia drug bust back in 2008.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It&#39;s my friend&#39;s dad. I&#39;m extremely fucking pissed off, he wasn&#39;t even driving the car, his DRIVER was. My friend was telling me that they must have planted the &quot;small amount of marijuana&quot; when they made the stop, because his dad didn&#39;t bring any on that ride, and it was found in a PAPER NAPKIN.. Cops are just as fucked up as the criminals.

Following that short story, here&#39;s the other one that they&#39;re talking about:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Hamilton crime boss Andre Gravelle has a long history in the drug smuggling business along with members of his extended family.

The 44-year-old businessman, who has been identified by police as an organized crime figure, was one of 12 people nabbed in Nova Scotia on the weekend in connection with an elaborate plot to import 751 kilograms of cannabis resin worth $15 million into Canada from the Caribbean. A Halifax RCMP spokesperson said it was the biggest drug bust in Nova Scotia history.

The alleged conspirators, who face numerous charges relating to the importation and trafficking of hash oil, included his brothers Denis Gravelle, 52, and Daniel George Gravelle, 47, and a relative, 27-year-old Edgar Gravelle.

It was the fourth time in the past 16 years that Andre has been charged with family members in a big international drug smuggling operation.

In 1992, he and his big brother, Paul Gravelle, now 61, were charged in connection with the importation of 450 kilograms of hash oil worth about $14 million from Jamaica through Florida and into Canada. Known by American police as Project Maple Syrup, it was hailed as the largest hash oil seizure in North America at the time. In 1993, a Florida court sentenced Andre to four years in a federal prison and his brother to a two-year sentence.

In 1998, Daniel was arrested along with a group of men in connection with a plot to import 314 kilograms of hash oil worth $12 million from Jamaica into Canadian via Halifax harbour. The drugs were concealed inside the tubing of a boat cradle that was towed along with a boat from Halifax to Burlington. Daniel was sentenced to 15 months of house arrest after pleading guilty to possession of hash oil for the purpose of trafficking.

Andre was also charged in the boat cradle caper. But the Crown withdrew the charge after two Hamilton lawyers swore out affidavits that he was in Hamilton when the cradle and boat were unloaded from a container ship in Nova Scotia.

In July 2002, Andre and Paul Gravelle were charged along with 15 other Ontario people in connection with a $95-million drug bust. The two-year police operation, which started in Hamilton, involved arrests in Quebec and Nova Scotia and resulted in the seizure of 268 kilograms of cocaine and smaller amounts of marijuana and hashish.

In 2003, the Gravelles pleaded guilty to a charge of marijuana trafficking. Andre got a year&#39;s probation and Paul served six months of custody and house arrest.

In an interview with The Spectator after his 2002 arrest, Paul Gravelle strongly denied an involvement in the sale of hard drugs, such as cocaine. They were bad for you, he said.

The lastest arrest comes just two years after Andre was cleared of first-degree murder in the November 1998 gangland-style execution of defence lawyer Lynn Gilbank and husband, Fred, both 52 years old.

Police believed Lynn was the main target and she was assassinated because she had arranged the witness protection program for a drug mule who had worked in Gravelle organization. But the Crown withdrew a first-degree murder charge against him days before his preliminary hearing was to start in June 2006. She said there was no reasonable expectation of a conviction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
