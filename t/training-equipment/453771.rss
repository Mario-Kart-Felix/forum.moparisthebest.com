    <title>Training Equipment</title>

    <description>So I recently added the 474 training equipment since I don&#39;t believe it was in the 317 revision and I was wondering if anyone could help me make the arrows stackable and the server recognize the bow well as a bow. I use delta and a non renamed client I already have all the ints for all the stacks of the arrows I just need to know how to make them stackable.
