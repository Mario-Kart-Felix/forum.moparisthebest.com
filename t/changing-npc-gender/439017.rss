              <p>Definitely. Although, I may have over complicated it. You wouldn’t <span class="bbcode-b">need</span> to change <span class="bbcode-b">EVERY</span> Npc definition in the cache, but you <span class="bbcode-b">SHOULD</span> for the sake of consistency. All you would really need to do is add an otherwise unused definition opcode, and process from there.</p>
<p>EDIT: Actually, you could accomplish this much easier with some protocol hackery. All you would need to do is add a new packet, with the modified model ids for the Npc (much like the player’s appearance block).</p>

But not sure that would work because wouldn’t it have to apply/work for all the entities listed as NPCs?</p>
<p>For example don’t think you can make the shark fin smaller on a shark smaller, and there are some pretty weird things like animated axes</p>
<p>Then again you can symbolize male and female with size differences? Not sure how it would work or why you’d need it but just a thought<br>

<p>It’s certainly possible, but it would require changing the format of the NPC data in the cache. Even then, it doesn’t necessarily need to be restricted to genders. I remember when I was modding Halo 2 maps, there were flags for the permutation of the Banshee (Normal or Heretic), and all it did was load a different image as the skin. The same could be applied here, but instead of skins, the models for the head, torso, legs, arms, etc.[/quote]<br>
Still a lot more work than the OP realized.</p>

              <p>As stated “genders” don’t really exist in the client. Granted, you could add a gender flag relatively easily. The only thing that changes are the models. (Female models are generally thinner, have breasts, etc).</p>

There is no such thing as a gender factor to making an NPC. You can, in fact, call ‘cat’ as a gender if you allow it.</p>
