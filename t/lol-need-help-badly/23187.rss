    <description>What does that hamachi thing mean? I downloaded it and I found post where is name and pass to hamachi.
I putt them to hamachi and POOF there is a gray thing where is ip:s and names. I logged in with that pass and name and I putt that server ip but nothing happens. So what I need to do in hamachi?! :p

When I update things in notepad and save they dont appear in moparscape. Like I click npc.cfg&gt;edit and I put there npc = 1 and hp 900 and I do that npc but it hp is still 0/0. 
Lol Im not good at this jobs and writing english but anyway

When I download project 1.6 and other server or what they are so when I start them there read 

Using port 4357                    I dont remember what port it was. But the server dont start. Why?

Btw I cant open doors and that and I dont know scripts to avoid that bug or whatever it is :p 
So can someone tell me these things fixing codes

Going castle wars
Npcs hp - That was that npc.cfg thing ?
Hitupdate fix - I found that but I dont know how to put that code lol :D more info for that pls
Can open doors and like that updates

BTW I just download testscape and when I started it there comes a message in runningbot:

Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NoClass.Def FoundError: server

How I can fix that?
