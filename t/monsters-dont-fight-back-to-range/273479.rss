    <title>Monsters don&#39;t fight back to range?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/monsters-dont-fight-back-to-range/273479</link>
    <description>Yeah..  For some reason, NPC&#39;s have... Trouble, responding properly to range attacks.  They do fight back to mage, however.  Normally I wouldn&#39;t care, but I have dark beasts, and rangers are just raping.  The dark beasts have decents drops, and I don&#39;t want the rangers to be the richest.  I already altered range pking, so that discourages rangers, but then I have this dilemma.  Normally, I&#39;d go through and read everything, but as of now it&#39;s late, I have to go soon, and I&#39;m working on other things that are of more importance.  Any help?

Thanks.</description>
