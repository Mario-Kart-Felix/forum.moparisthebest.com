    <title>Just take a look here</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/just-take-a-look-here/319137</link>
    <description>First of all , if i posted in a wrong section , just warn me or w.e , i&#39;ll suffer the consequences.

Just think about that:

Why all of you try to make your own rsc srv instead of helping each other to do a better server like stork was ? I think i&#39;m not the only one which want to have a good rsc pking server, for me stork was the best , and when i say stork i mean the FIRST stork not those that followed.

If i was a good coder , really , i did it my self , but i don&#39;t even know how to code , so i&#39;ll wait when someone will think about at what i said. I know some of you are verry good at coding so that might be a solution...
So please just think at those words i write up there and do something , i think ( and i hope ) i&#39;m not the only one which is sick about those servers which have only 10-20 ppl on. I want a server with at least 50 ppl on all the time , like was stork (even if it have more then 50 ppl on everytime) , and at least 30 ppl in wild to pk. 

p.s. sorry for my bad english .. if this topic is useless delete it.</description>

<p>In fact, xEnt actually wanted a PK server along side RSCA but KO9 said the same thing as I just have (I believe).</p>

<p>I said I don’t have the time\am not really interested. However we were going to do one purely to make some money, got a dedi and shit but other stuff got in the way of actually doing anything.</p>
