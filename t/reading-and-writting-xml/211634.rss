    <title>Reading and Writting XML</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/reading-and-writting-xml/211634</link>
    <description>Well serveral people i have spoken to have said that Java handling of XML is slow and CPU consuming.
Compared to the alternate ways for reading and writting, is using XML a better choice?

Because i spent some time learning it when i was creating websites and it would be rather helpful in my programming :)</description>

              <p>DOM is rubbish for java programmers,</p>
<p>DOM code</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">DocumentFactory docfac = DocumentFactoryMaker.getFactory();
Document doc = docfac.newDocument();
ElementFactory elemfac = ElementFactoryMaker.getFactory();
Element rootElement = elemfac.newElement("doc");
rootElement.setText(TextFactory.fromString("text in element"));</code></pre>
<p>[size=7pt]note: these are not the names the DOM library uses, but you get the idea of the structure[/size]</p>
<p>equivalent code in JDOM</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Document doc = new Document();
Element rootElement = new Element("doc");
rootElement.setText("text in element");
doc.setRootELement(rootElement);</code></pre>
<p>as you can see the JDOM code makes much more sence to a java programmer,<br>
if you’re wondering <span class="bbcode-i">why</span> DOM is so bad, its because it was meant to work on many languages other then java, some which didnt even have OOP,</p>
<p>think about it this way, if DOM was so incredible, why did they bother to make JDOM?</p>
<p>as for size, you should see how bloated MS word documents are,</p>
<p>and a Binary XML is the shittest idea ever, it defeats the entire point of xml,<br>
think about it this way ruler, if Binary XML was such a good idea, someone would have already made it (in fact people <span class="bbcode-i">have</span> tried to make it, but its never adopted cause everyone else realises how fail it is)</p>
<p>if you’re trying to optimize for size, you wont use xml, or a Binary XML, but a complete binary solution, which will lose all the advantages of xml,</p>
<p>as for bandwidth, you should see how much is “wasted” by VoIP and video applications,<br>
do you know of an email protocol called POP, it was made quite a long time ago, its a text based protocol, similar to IRC in some ways, and its for reading (but not writing) emails,</p>
<p>it has some very dirty hacks there to make it work, commands are separated by newlines, but emails contain newlines… so POP does very un-elegant things,<br>
POP has gone about 6 or 7 revisions, and its still sometimes used today, and if you’re lucky, you wont get mixed up with versions,</p>
<p>if they used XML in the first place, they wouldn’t have all this dirty cracking, because xml is extensible, they could have very easily added new fixes and features without breaking old systems, and there is no greasy hack to make newlines work either,</p>
<p>I’m a big fan of elegance,<br>
there elegance in mathematical theorems, elegance in chemistry techniques, and elegance in programming,</p>
<p>when it comes to elegance, xml is king.</p>

also a very nice library <a href="http://www.jdom.org/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.jdom.org/</a></p>
<p>also there is this library which comes with java, it has a different structure to JDOM, you can stream the xml, if you want to use less processing power, use this one for reading, it cannot write xml <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/org/xml/sax/package-summary.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/org/xml/sax/package-summary.html</a></p>
<p>its quite likely that other people will attack xml on this thread,<br>
