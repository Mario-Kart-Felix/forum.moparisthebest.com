        <p>right here goes nothing, im someone one of those hundred billion people out there,<br>
a small percentage of the popularty.<br>
life is one of those things that always confuses you at every corner in your life,<br>
the meaning of life always escapes my grasp leaving me confused and paranoid,<br>
people dont mean much to me i like to keep my thoughts to my self or mayby write them down in a story<br>
hiding them in the words, but theres that one but life is sometimes a bore i some times wonder why<br>
do we exist, is it some strange things that happend in he past or is it more than that, we might just be an experiment in a lab<br>
or mayby someone did create us you never know and i doubt we ever will unless we create a time machine (as if).<br>
time another thange that annoys me tick tock theres that clock it drives me insane.<br>
machines bloody hell things that brake down you have to pay to get it repaired why bother leave it, throw it dont matter just leave it on the edge of the curb see if its gone in the morning,<br>
mayby the local tramp will take it but know its still there in the morning, burn it, smash if you mush whatever i dont care.<br>
smoking who ever inveted it i want to hunt down and kill the bloody git the Sticks Of Death i should  write a story about that, NOT!<br>
school school school it desgined to teach us about life when you cannot teach life, life teaches you.<br>
i wish i wish people would copme round to under stand cars will kill us all but know they all still drive the plouting crack car round the earth if we complain.<br>
thats another thing i dont under stand how on earth did evoloution come up with diffrent races its mind boggling.<br>
but still life has its funny part the last 15 years of my life rember tine bits my mind gets set to forget and i forget what iv done<br>
i cannot even rember a few days ago all i know i went to school and came back.<br>
friends man they annoy me moan moan moan thats all they can do and then you got the people that just sit there and take it and not take any notice im sometimes like that<br>
but if i hold that in too long bang i go off like a rocket in a tight container oh well that it for now of one of the figures of life.</p>
