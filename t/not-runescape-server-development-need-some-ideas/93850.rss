    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/not-runescape-server-development-need-some-ideas/93850</link>
    <description>Alright, I can&#39;t stand working with a team, so please only post suggestions and not &quot;I want to help you make the server!&quot; mostly because I prefer working alone and most people who even bother reading this kind of thread aren&#39;t too great at java (no offense)

Also - this is the help AND development section, so dont spam saying this doesnt belong here. Thanks.

SERVERS NAME IS &#39;Not RuneScape&#39; lol by the way, title might make you think other wise.


Current Features:

Nice Arrow/Darts/Knives/Javelins/etc. Projectiles - They fly smoothly through the air like real RuneScape.

Magic Handler For Great Magic - NPCs freeze from entangle, bind, ice barrage, etc. for a short time. If you fail to cast a spell, you still launch the projectile but the finish is a splash isntead of the normal finish ID. Supports runes and levels for all spell.
The entangle timers on npcs and players are only set to, say for instance 30, if their entangle delay is 0 (this way you cant barrage them every 10 seconds to keep them in place without even a second to try to move)
Teleblock holds for less than a minute or else when people die the ywill just log out anywayz to teleport

A Start To Prayer - Retribution works fine for when you die in the wild (hits players around you), Protect from melee makes melee NPCs hit half there normal hit. Protect from magic makes maging NPCs hit half the normal damage (dragons do not apply to this)

Dragons will randomly either headbutt you or hit you with a fire ball

A Good start to worldly NPCs (all over the place, you could walk for instance from lumbridge to varrock and see a decently close replica of RuneScape)

Very close to full special attacks with real special attack bar

Rare item smithing

Runecrafting - Click locate on the tallys to teleport, depending on how many essence you have in your inventory determines how many runes you will recive x2

all skills that normalay are item on item (so no log on anvil to start fire), ARE item on item, so tinderbox/log used on tinderbox/log

Working Woodcutting

Working Firemaking

Working Herblore

Working Mining

Start to thieving, you can pickpocket men and women and thieve from stalls

Start to fletching

Working Fishing

Working Cooking - chances of you burning the food is like 1/100

Working Smelting

The dummy can only be used for a short time, from there you have to train on NPCs

Working Autocast on NPCs

Theres normal PKing, and then theres dueling, where you teleport next to your opponent and cant move until the duel ends, and then theres Final Fantasy style fighting, where you cant attack until someone has attacked you, and once you attack someone, you cant attack, you get the idea.

Player Facing Player, Player facing obects, player facing Npcs, npcs facing players


Simpel Mini-game - As long as you can cast a barrage spell(high enough level), you can play. You have alittle over a minute. You are stuck in a small boxed in area. Outside are cows. Each time you cast a barrage attack on them, you recieve a barrage point. In the end you gain a fair amount of XP in magic depeding on how many you casted, no matter if they hit or not.

MORE TO COME

Alright, I may have missed a few things, but you get the idea of what I have.

So... Any suggestions for my server?? Will go online in up to 3 more weeks (been working on it for id say around 2 weeks now)


opinions on these:

i currently have commands for items, but which the exception of some, that are only at shops, and some that are rare drops from NPCs, such as d chain, d2h, and others, should i keep it like this, or maybe list spawnable items i should have, and rest have to be bought/dropped

MORE TO COME

here are some images of a some of the servers current features, again please psot your ideas for the server

<p>MoparScape isn’t a game, it’s a forum.  This isn’t here so people can play on the RS2 private servers, it’s so that people can learn to code Java and maybe other languages, C++, C, Python, etc.</p>

<p>Everything you named there can be changed dramatically.  Sources are like putty in you’re hand, you just need to know what you’re doing.</p>
<p>The people who work with Jagex, the people behind RuneScape yes, are very skilled in Java and other things.  There’s different types of jobs there, Graphics Designers, Quest Designers, Mini-Game designers, Weapon Designes, cleaners, etc.  The people who work for Jagex and made RuneScape are highly qualified in Java, other languages aswell but mainly Java I would guess.  They’ve been to college and uni, the works.  People here have only learned from some shitty tutorials and maybe if they were patient enough, read some of the Java tutorials on the Java official website.  That’s why, nothing we could do could ever compare to what Jagex do.</p>
<ol>
<li>We don’t have the money</li>
<li>We don’t have the staff</li>
<li>We don’t have the brain power</li>
</ol>
<p>So yeah, that’s why RuneScape2 is better.  We can atleast fucking try to make a decent RS2 private server though, with a little hard work and team-work, no-one seems to be capable of that though.</p>

              <p>I Br3ndan I you make MoparScape sound like a game when all it is is a old RuneScape client. The whole ‘private server’ thing is a spin off of RuneScape. Same NPCs, same items, same world, same moving system, etc with minor diffrences, one of them being we don’t have all the RuneScape updates, our codes suck compared to RuneScapes, and we can make small custom features like skills that for the most part usually suck anyway or custom quests or minigames that usually aren’t as good as RuneScape as well.</p>

<p>For instance, you said the prayer Retribution works “perfectly”, more like, it works the same as in RuneScape2.  Why not think something up of you’re own, think of something else it could do?

              <p>Alright, I can’t stand working with a team, so please only post suggestions and not “I want to help you make the server!” mostly because I prefer working alone and most people who even bother reading this kind of thread aren’t too great at java (no offense)</p>
<p>Also - this is the help AND development section, so dont spam saying this doesnt belong here. Thanks.</p>
<p>SERVERS NAME IS ‘Not RuneScape’ lol by the way, title might make you think other wise.</p>
<p>Current Features:</p>
<p>Nice Arrow/Darts/Knives/Javelins/etc. Projectiles - They fly smoothly through the air like real RuneScape.</p>
<p>Magic Handler For Great Magic - NPCs freeze from entangle, bind, ice barrage, etc. for a short time. If you fail to cast a spell, you still launch the projectile but the finish is a splash isntead of the normal finish ID. Supports runes and levels for all spell.<br>
The entangle timers on npcs and players are only set to, say for instance 30, if their entangle delay is 0 (this way you cant barrage them every 10 seconds to keep them in place without even a second to try to move)<br>
Teleblock holds for less than a minute or else when people die the ywill just log out anywayz to teleport</p>
<p>A Start To Prayer - Retribution works fine for when you die in the wild (hits players around you), Protect from melee makes melee NPCs hit half there normal hit. Protect from magic makes maging NPCs hit half the normal damage (dragons do not apply to this)</p>
<p>Dragons will randomly either headbutt you or hit you with a fire ball</p>
<p>A Good start to worldly NPCs (all over the place, you could walk for instance from lumbridge to varrock and see a decently close replica of RuneScape)</p>
<p>Very close to full special attacks with real special attack bar</p>
<p>Rare item smithing</p>
<p>Runecrafting - Click locate on the tallys to teleport, depending on how many essence you have in your inventory determines how many runes you will recive x2</p>
<p>all skills that normalay are item on item (so no log on anvil to start fire), ARE item on item, so tinderbox/log used on tinderbox/log</p>
<p>Working Woodcutting</p>
<p>Working Firemaking</p>
<p>Working Herblore</p>
<p>Working Mining</p>
<p>Start to thieving, you can pickpocket men and women and thieve from stalls</p>
<p>Start to fletching</p>
<p>Working Fishing</p>
<p>Working Cooking - chances of you burning the food is like 1/100</p>
<p>Working Smelting</p>
<p>The dummy can only be used for a short time, from there you have to train on NPCs</p>
<p>Working Autocast on NPCs</p>
<p>Theres normal PKing, and then theres dueling, where you teleport next to your opponent and cant move until the duel ends, and then theres Final Fantasy style fighting, where you cant attack until someone has attacked you, and once you attack someone, you cant attack, you get the idea.</p>
<p>Player Facing Player, Player facing obects, player facing Npcs, npcs facing players</p>
<p>Simpel Mini-game - As long as you can cast a barrage spell(high enough level), you can play. You have alittle over a minute. You are stuck in a small boxed in area. Outside are cows. Each time you cast a barrage attack on them, you recieve a barrage point. In the end you gain a fair amount of XP in magic depeding on how many you casted, no matter if they hit or not.</p>
<p>MORE TO COME</p>
<p>Alright, I may have missed a few things, but you get the idea of what I have.</p>
<p>So… Any suggestions for my server?? Will go online in up to 3 more weeks (been working on it for id say around 2 weeks now)</p>
<p>opinions on these:</p>
<p>i currently have commands for items, but which the exception of some, that are only at shops, and some that are rare drops from NPCs, such as d chain, d2h, and others, should i keep it like this, or maybe list spawnable items i should have, and rest have to be bought/dropped</p>
<p>MORE TO COME</p>
<p>here are some images of a some of the servers current features, again please psot your ideas for the server</p>
