    <title>Communism</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/communism/243921</link>
    <description>Communism is ofter related to country&#39;s such as China and the former Soviet Union. But let&#39;s define Communism: &quot;Communism is the theory of a classless social system in which all property and means of production are owned in common; socialist theory deriving from the works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.&quot; It also means that everyone is equal. If everyone is equal, you don&#39;t have a government, because the people in a government wouldn&#39;t be equal to the rest. So you can ask yourself: was the Soviet Union really a communistic union?

The Soviet Union had 2 main leaders. First Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, also known as Vladimir Lenin. He was the one that led the October-Revolution. After his death in 1924, he was replaced by Josef Stalin. Stalin was the one that everyone feared. Stalin led a terror regime. Anyone that was in the way of his ideas was either killed or sent to a Gulag. 

But let&#39;s connect the dots. Communism means that everyone is equal. Everyone lives in harmony with eachother. The population is represented in soviets, or counsils. So everyone has an equal amount of power. Stalin, and Lenin aswell, were dictators. They had all the power. According to Lenin, it was a neccesary step towards full communism. First, the state aqcuires all property, and then it&#39;s equally divided between the population and the state stops existing. Lenin died before he could complete his plans. Stalin would never do the last step, he was satisfied with his power.

To summarize: Communism is different from what most people think. The USSR wasn&#39;t (and China isn&#39;t) a communist country.</description>

<p>Ha yes, but I will call myself Reinin, as Lenin is the pseudonym of Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov. Lenin comes from the river Lena. Georgi Plechanov, another Russian Marxist, named himself Volgin. The two didn’t agree with eachother. Volgin comes from the river Volga, and Lena streams in the opposite direction. As did their oppinions.</p>

You are not equal.[/quote]</p>
<p>If the parents, or in high school the students, hear that a teacher isn’t doing his job right, they tell the representative of their counsil.</p>
<p>Let’s say that Mr. Jones is a teacher. He tells his students that they can do whatever they want, as long as they don’t tell anyone. Mr. Jones get’s paid, but he doesn’t teach his students anything. As you saw in one of my previous posts, there is a middle or city counsil. That counsil deals with things like education per school. If needed, some people are asked to come and tell about the teacher. If the counsil thinks that it’s running out of hand, they plan a meeting. They invite the teacher, students that he teaches, parents and if needed other teachers. In this case it’s obvious that the teacher gets fired, and he’ll probably wont be a teacher anymore.</p>
<p>[quote=“bowserjr2, post:34, topic:243921”]Who has the more power, the theacher or the headmaster?<br>
The teacher can’t fire the headmaster, but the headmaster can fire the teacher.<br>
They are not equal.[/quote]</p>
<p>The teachers decide what is best for their school, they don’t need a headmaster. The city counsil tells them what the parents expect from the school, and the teachers plan how to do that. That’s plain logic, because not everyone knows how to run a school. Lets say that in school A they teach Economics, English, Maths and Spanish. Teachers that teach Spanish, don’t know how much about Maths. So it’s obvious that Spanish teachers compose the booklist for Spanish, and the Maths teachers compose the booklist for Maths. So the lower level of running a school is dealt with.</p>
<p>But to run a school you also have to decide what blackboards you need, how many computers you need etc. This is done by all teachers. They come together and explain how many, and why, they need an x amount of computers for their course. Then they make a plan on how many they actually buy.</p>

<p>The counsil is controlled by the people, and the people are the counsil. There are higher counsils so that you don’t have a meeting of 2 million people, but smaller numbers.</p>

<p>That’s the reason behind the revolution started by Lenin. His idea was that in order to reach true Communism, the state had to acquire everything. When that is completed, the ‘state’ stops existing and the counsils (the population) takes over.</p>

<p>Communism is not a good idea, because there have to be different people in a country, we need people with power, like a teacher in a class, headmaster on a school, and someone in the government that decide over the all the schools.</p>

The problem is that what can you live of on the Moon, selling moon stones?<br>
Communism can only apper when a country need a new start to build it self big.<br>
You can’t make a moon colony and hope people will live there. (Or anywere else.)</p>

With capitalism,  more companies are going to produce better quality goods at a lower price due to competition.<br>

With capitalism big companies like Microsoft can control, make it impossible to small companies to start.<br>
Then when Microsoft have the controll they can self decide the price.[/quote]<br>

<p>Dictatorship is not the result of communism, it’s the result of liberators that wanted power. Lenin started this, but it was Stalin who gave the word dictator a meaning.

Answer to quote number 1:<br>
Oh, I actually did not mean it like that, I meant that the ones that has tried out communism or atleast been called communists, never worked out/or wasn’t communistic in the first place.</p>
<p>Answer to quote number 2:<br>
Ah, so your saying that if Lenin (or Stalin for that matter) did perform the last step, Soviet would not have anymore “leaders”? And people just living for themselves. Does not seem perfectly safe to me.</p>
