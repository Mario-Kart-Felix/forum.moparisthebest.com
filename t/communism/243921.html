        <p>Communism is ofter related to country’s such as China and the former Soviet Union. But let’s define Communism: “Communism is the theory of a classless social system in which all property and means of production are owned in common; socialist theory deriving from the works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.” It also means that everyone is equal. If everyone is equal, you don’t have a government, because the people in a government wouldn’t be equal to the rest. So you can ask yourself: was the Soviet Union really a communistic union?</p>
<p>The Soviet Union had 2 main leaders. First Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, also known as Vladimir Lenin. He was the one that led the October-Revolution. After his death in 1924, he was replaced by Josef Stalin. Stalin was the one that everyone feared. Stalin led a terror regime. Anyone that was in the way of his ideas was either killed or sent to a Gulag.</p>
<p>But let’s connect the dots. Communism means that everyone is equal. Everyone lives in harmony with eachother. The population is represented in soviets, or counsils. So everyone has an equal amount of power. Stalin, and Lenin aswell, were dictators. They had all the power. According to Lenin, it was a neccesary step towards full communism. First, the state aqcuires all property, and then it’s equally divided between the population and the state stops existing. Lenin died before he could complete his plans. Stalin would never do the last step, he was satisfied with his power.</p>
<p>To summarize: Communism is different from what most people think. The USSR wasn’t (and China isn’t) a communist country.</p>

        <p>That isn’t true. Take a look at the following schematic:</p>
<p><img src="http://img359.imageshack.us/my.php?image=schematicmh9.jpg" alt width="" height=""><br>
<a href="http://img359.imageshack.us/my.php?image=schematicpo9.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img359.imageshack.us/img359/6902/schematicpo9.th.jpg" alt width="" height=""></a><a href="http://g.imageshack.us/thpix.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img359.imageshack.us/images/thpix.gif" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>Say that the numbers were correct. There are a total of 8 households in a province, divided over 2 city’s. Each city consists of 2 neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Every household has one person as their representative. These representatives come together in the lowest council. They name one person the representative of their counsil, and that person sits in the middle counsil, or the city counsil. Each city names a given amount of people the city representatives. In this schematic it would be one person, but it’s obvious that there are more. Those two are the highest council (again, in this example there are two, but in reality there are more).</p>
<p>The highest council listens to the middle counsil, which in turn listens to the lower counsil. This way, the households are in control. If a household doesn’t agree with something, they let their household representative talk about it in the lower counsil. If more counsil members agree, the lower counsil representative takes some ideas to the middle counsil. Again, if the middle counsil agrees, the issue is taken to the higher counsil.</p>
<p>This is nothing more then a schematic, but it summarised the idea. In a real situation, there would be at least to representatives from each counsil, so that one can keep an eye on the other.</p>

<p>The counsils meet once a week. Those in the lower counsils evaluate their representatives, and discuss about problems that they have. If there is a problem that can be taken care of locally, they vote about different solutions. If there is a problem that involves the whole city, the lower counsil representatives are ordered to take this issue to the city counsil. An example is a malfunctioning sewer system. Every lower counsil should come up with an idea, and the representative takes that idea to the city counsil.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that there are no company’s in a communist country. Everyone has his/her proffesion, and does his job. A farmer produces milk, that can be bought by carpenters. Carpenters build houses, and are payed by those who build the houses. No company’s means that profit isn’t the goal. This means cheaper suply’s.</p>
<p>Say that the wage is €10 per hour. To build a house, you need 200 planks, 500 nails and 50 man hours (quite a simple house, but it’s just an example) It takes 2 hours to make the planks, and 1 hour to make the nails. So a house would only cost 53 hours, or €530. Planks €20, nails €10 and man hours €500.</p>
<p>Lets take that example to capitalism. Again, the wage is €10 per hour, and you need the same amount of materials to build the house. But, because it’s done by a company, there is a profit margin of 50%. This sounds much, but in reality it’s low. Now, the planks cost €20 to make, but with the profit they cost €30. The nails now are €15 and the man hours are €750. That’s a total of €795.</p>
<p>So, in a communist country, you will have to work 53 hours to build this house. To be able to buy the same house in a capitalist country, you will need to work 79.5 hours. That’s 50% more.</p>

        <p>With communism, people are producing goods at the lowest possible price. There still are factory’s, and it is possible that they compete quality wise.</p>
<p>Let’s break down the price you pay for goods in a shop, in a capitalist country. Let’s take planks as an example:</p>
<p>First, you pay capital needed to grow trees. This contains the ground, and the seeds, but also the chainsaws and other machines needed to cut the tree. Then you have to pay for the manhours needed to actually cut down the tree. Next to that you have to pay the profits of the company that cuts the trees. Then the cut trees go to a saw mill. Again, you have to pay for the machines needed to make planks, and the manhours. And yes, again the profit.</p>
<p>The freshly cut planks now travel to a wholesale. This again needs capital, manhours, and profits. Finally it gets transported to a shop (capital and manhours needed), that makes profit too.</p>
<p>Lets summarise the amount of capital, manhours and profit in a capitalist system:<br>
Capital: 4<br>
Manhours: 4<br>
Profit: 4</p>
<p>So, you have to pay for the company’s profits 4 times. Lets say that every company has a profit margin of 50%. Every company has an added value of €10. Here is a table of the costs, and profits:</p>
<p>Step	Initial cost 	     Price after profit	<br>
+ added value<br>
1	     10		                   15<br>
2	     25		                   37.5<br>
3	     47.5 		                   71.25<br>
4	     81.25		                   121.875</p>
<p>(Initial cost means the price the company has to pay for the base product they use. The added value is the value they add, in this case €10)</p>
<p>Now, without profits from company’s:</p>
<p>Step	Initial cost + added value<br>
1	  10<br>
2	  20<br>
3	  30<br>
4	  40</p>
<p>The difference is €81,88 or 204,69%. Again, a profit margin of 50% is nothing. Most companys add at least 80%.</p>
<p>(sorry for the fucked up tables)</p>

        <p>Companies need money to grow bigger.</p>
<p>Let make it little other.</p>
<p>Let us say the price for to make 10 plank is 10€ with paying the workers and things like that. (Both in the capitalism and communism)</p>
<p>Communism.</p>
<ol>
<li>year Make 10 plank sell it for 10€.</li>
<li>year Make 10 plank sell it for 10€.</li>
<li>year Make 10 plank sell it for 10€.</li>
<li>year Make 10 plank sell it for 10€.</li>
<li>year Make 10 plank sell it for 10€.</li>
<li>year Make 10 plank sell it for 10€.</li>
<li>year Make 10 plank sell it for 10€.</li>
<li>year Make 10 plank, but there is so little plank on the marked so they who need it pay more to get the little that is on the market,</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us say, for one hour you need 200 planks.<br>
That will cost 2000€ normal price, but since they who build the houses have raised the price to 30€ for 10 planks it will cost 6000€ for the planks.</p>
<p>Since there is so little house on the marked things like this happen with the house to, the price increase to 3. the price. so the house now cost 18000€.</p>
<p>In the capitalisn system.<br>
Company</p>
<ol>
<li>year Makes 10 planks sell it for 15€.</li>
<li>year Makes 15 planks sell it for 22.5€</li>
<li>year Makes 22 planks sell it for 33€</li>
<li>year Makes 33 planks sell it for 49,5€</li>
<li>year Makes 50 planks sell it for 75€</li>
<li>year Makes 75 planks sell it for 112,5€</li>
<li>year Makes 112.5 planks sell it for 168,75</li>
<li>year Makes 168 planks.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is now near 17 times so many planks on the marked that on the communist marked.<br>
A house cost 200 planks, but since the is so much competion and planks they can only take 20% profit.<br>
So one house cost 2400€ to buy planks to.<br>
There is lots of houses to.<br>
So they who build it can only take 20% profitt at this time.<br>
2880€ will the house cost.</p>
<p>18000€ by communist, 2880€ by capitalist.</p>

        <p>(bowserjr2, could you please pay a little more attention to your spelling? I can read it, but sometimes it’s annoying.)</p>
<p>Ok, lets look at bowserjr2’s statement: company’s (and thus the market they operate in) need money to grow. If you want to prove that this statement is either true or false, you have to consider the complete economy. So let’s remake a small economy, or atleast markets that are needed for the production of planks.</p>
<p>Materials needed:<br>
Chainsaw.<br>
Tractor to transport trees out of the forest.<br>
Truck to transport the tree to the saw mill.<br>
Saw mill.<br>
Truck to transport the planks to the marketplace/costumer, with low demand this can be the same as the previously mentioned truck.</p>
<p>Humans needed:<br>
Costumers<br>
Woodcutters<br>
Saw mill workers<br>
Truck driver<br>
Chainsaw producers<br>
Saw mill producers<br>
Truck manufactorer</p>
<p>Let’s say that in one year, there is a production of 1000 planks. To produce these planks, you need 1 chainsaw, 1 truck, 1 saw mill, 1 tractor and 50 man hours. Again, it is really hard to make an exact estimate, because to make a chainsaw you need steel. To make steel you need ore, etc. But let’s say that it requires 10 hours to make the chainsaw, 100 hours to make the truck, 50 hours to make the saw mill and 50 hours to make the tractor. That’s a total of 210 hours, or €2100 at €10 an hour. The total cost to produce 1000 planks is €2600. €2.6 a plank.</p>
<p>A researcher has developed a new kind of chainsaw, that allows a production of 1100 planks a year. This researcher spent an average of 10 hours per chainsaw to develop it. It’s an average, because it would be stupid if he developed a new chainsaw, and only sell one. So now the production is 1100 planks (the market has grown), the cost was 10 hours, and the gain was 100 planks. In hours, this is 10% of 1000 thus 10% of 260 hours, so a gain of 26 hours. As you can see here, the cost was 10 hours, and the gain was 26 hours. The market grew, and it didn’t cost anything. But we forgot one thing: the chainsaw was developed, but it hasn’t been made. Let’s say that it takes 16 hours to produce this new model.</p>
<p>So, in year 2 we produced 1100 planks. What did it cost?<br>
Chainsaw: 26 hours<br>
Truck: 100 hours<br>
Saw mill: 50 hours<br>
Tractor: 50 hours<br>
Manhours (saw mill, forest, truck/tractor driver): 50 hours<br>
Total: 276 hours, €2760, or €2,51 a plank.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The market grew, and planks became 9 cents cheaper.</span></p>

<p>Dictatorship is not the result of communism, it’s the result of liberators that wanted power. Lenin started this, but it was Stalin who gave the word dictator a meaning. According to Lenin, there is a step between capitalism and communism. First the state has to own everything. The final step is that the state divides everything, and the state stops existing. Things didn’t go as planned: Lenin died, Stalin got the power and didn’t make the final step.</p>

Answer to quote number 1:<br>
Oh, I actually did not mean it like that, I meant that the ones that has tried out communism or atleast been called communists, never worked out/or wasn’t communistic in the first place.</p>
<p>Answer to quote number 2:<br>
Ah, so your saying that if Lenin (or Stalin for that matter) did perform the last step, Soviet would not have anymore “leaders”? And people just living for themselves. Does not seem perfectly safe to me.</p>
