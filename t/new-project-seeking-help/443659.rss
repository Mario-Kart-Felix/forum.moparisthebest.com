    <title>New Project: Seeking Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-project-seeking-help/443659</link>
    <description>Hello--

I&#39;ve lurked these forums every so often for a while, and finally decided it was time to come forth. I&#39;m extremely interested in developing a Runescape Classic Private Server. Like many of the contemporary servers, I&#39;d like to go beyond just providing a simple (or pk biased) classic experience and I assume that the work involved would be a little harder than other undertakings. 

I&#39;m looking to form a team to help me develop the ideas that I have in mind. Anyone with experience working with an RSC Private Server is welcome to send me a private message, whereupon I will give you my little powerpoint. All I&#39;d ask is for privacy (the assumption of non-disclosure). 

I know that it is hard for any one of you to adequately measure the merit behind this post, especially without a more comprehensive understanding of what I aim to do, but I think that those of you who do respond will be intrigued by my proposition. 

There&#39;s no money to be involved (if there comes to a point where we need money to pay for a website or additional resources, I will fund all of the expenses) and no commitment necessary. In fact, if you are simply interested in what I am up to, I will gladly share my idea under the assumption of no-competition (lol, post-facebook, one must keep their proprietary ideas safe). I know that I am probably deviating the norm by seeking a project for a potential commercial release, which requires this thin veil of secrecy. However, this is simply the best place to find real RSC PS developers, and therefore I humbly request your attention.

Tl;dr

I&#39;d like to form a team to develop a project I have in mind based of RSC. Private message me for more information. :-)

Thank you,

Az</description>

<p>True, but this isn’t your typical type of server. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
