[b]exactly. just like on a time line. when society started, it didn't start at a point. it started in a process. more than one exact time. normality isn't all the same. different places, areas, cultures have their own "normal". everything and one is different according to how they've lived, their experiences with other people, and their choices. you can't put a definition around what normal is.[/b]

        <p>It gets slower around 11:00 p.m. Est. I can tell you right now, no one here is normal, given that society defines normalcy as “according with, constituting, or not deviating from a norm, rule, or principle”. by Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary. We operate well outside of the norm here. The whole idea that there is something wrong with everyone is so far off from being right. It’s our flaws that help define us I believe.</p>
