    <title>What is &quot;normal&quot; behavior</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-is-normal-behavior/228010</link>
    <description>yeah i totally jacked this from another community I&#39;m on, but the posts didn&#39;t come in as much as i expected. hopefully you guys will talk a bit more.

Anyways there&#39;s nothing really to add to the title besides some other small opinions I&#39;ve seen.

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no normal, except how society &#39;defines&#39; it. But why should we go along with what society has said?

Everyone has something wrong with them. Everyone should be in a mental hospitals and getting meds for this reason or that. Someone explain the difference to mean between a person with a Narcissistic Personality Disorder and a selfish and arrogant person, not diagnosed by a doctor.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Normality is subject to each individual...for example, if I thought that doing jumping jacks before every meal was a normal thing, but you thought it was weird, then there ya go. At least that&#39;s how I see it. Normality is relative.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Abnormality can be defined by...

-Inability to function adequately
-Falling outside of statistical norms
-Falling out of social norms

and another one i cant remember&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;it is what that person&#39;s habits are. what one person&#39;s norm is different than another person&#39;s. yet in society sense it is whatever doesn&#39;t fit in with that certain way of thinking. the society&#39;s morals and what have you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And my opinion:


&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no normal, except how society &#39;defines&#39; it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[b]exactly. just like on a time line. when society started, it didn&#39;t start at a point. it started in a process. more than one exact time. normality isn&#39;t all the same. different places, areas, cultures have their own &quot;normal&quot;. everything and one is different according to how they&#39;ve lived, their experiences with other people, and their choices. you can&#39;t put a definition around what normal is.[/b]</description>

              <p>It gets slower around 11:00 p.m. Est. I can tell you right now, no one here is normal, given that society defines normalcy as “according with, constituting, or not deviating from a norm, rule, or principle”. by Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary. We operate well outside of the norm here. The whole idea that there is something wrong with everyone is so far off from being right. It’s our flaws that help define us I believe.</p>
