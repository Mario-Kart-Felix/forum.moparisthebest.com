<p>You would be daft to believe that Limewire didn’t profit even a little from the run that they were on. From website advertising, selling their clients (aka limewire pro), etc. Obviously it doesn’t approach the staggering amounts that the music industry is seeking but I’m sure the judge will see fit to make them pay reparations close to what they profited before they shutdown.</p>
