    <title>[Hyperion] How to find out the id&#39;s when you clicked on a button?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hyperion-how-to-find-out-the-ids-when-you-clicked-on-a-button/526311</link>
    <description>Hello

I&#39;m currently trying to make fletching 100%. Now I got the interface loaded, and that works fine, but whenever I click on the bow or on &quot;make 5/10/X/all&quot;, there is no id that is being printed out anywhere, so I don&#39;t know where to start.

This is the code used to load the interface:

[code=java]player.getActionSender().sendInterfaceModel(309, 2, 160, 841);
player.getActionSender().sendString(309, (309 - 296), &quot;What would you like to make?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot; + ItemDefinition.forId(log.getItem()[1]).getName());
player.getActionSender().sendChatboxInterface(309);
player.setInterfaceAttribute(&quot;fletching_log&quot;, log);[/code]
So how would I be able to find out which id is related to make 1/5/10/x/all so the player can actually make the bow?</description>
