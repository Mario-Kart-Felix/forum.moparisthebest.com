    <description>Greetings i am Cashh owner of projectcashh.servequake.com and also if u guys play alot of project czar servers u might know me.

anyways im asking my question is my server i updated pickup command so u can pickupsilabs i added a ::mb command to tele to magebank and pk there lever works. i added a ::edgepk command which teles you to edge wild right before it. also i added a bank there to make it easier to bank so people can fight more often. i did not change starter place but i chnaged starting outfit. i added that when u get 100 skill u get a skillcape hood, skill cape and a skill cape (t). also i added to the zeke shop where u can buy 3rd age armour with the new added 3rd age range. also the 3rdagearea drops it. i added alot of new items. such as ::silabdhide ::silabrobes ::silabele ::silabnavy ::lunararmor ::moonclan , ::silabcapest and ::random there might be more idk right now lol. i ficed the shoulder glitches on torso and all other weapons. i added a kbd area that drops bandos and armadyl. i added def requirements on bandos is 80 armadyl is 80 and 3rd age meele is 85 def. also i added a fun command that some ppl like called ::300armor which is a outfit that looks like one of the people from the movie 300. i have added all the godswords and placed them in the member shop. but i have not yet made the difrent specials for zamorak, armadyl and saradomin. if anyone has a tutorial or advice for me to do that i will be happy to do that. i am posting this in school right now and i do not have my pictures with me but as soon as i get home in like 5 hours i will post pictures of the items and stuff. please mods do not lock this, its only a request to release my server when i finish it. also i would like to state am not the best coder but i am ok. reforced or d d 3 or anyone that reads this and can join me, or maybe help me in making this server a good one for our fellow moparscaper.
 
If you have any questions comments concerns or suggestions about my server on how i can improve it u can either Email me at                  lolup00ned@hotmail.com or i am on msn from time to time.

ty anyone for reading this and taking the time if u did to help me out in my journey to create a good working moparserver.
P:S: if you can help me code or anything i suggest you download this good program that helps coders do work and stuff easily. 
www.teamviewer.com its a good working program.

<p>This sounds okay.</p>

              <p>I use the same design.  I’m adding a GS minigame right now.  I’d also suggest improving your server by taking out the manta buying from shops, and making it so you buy them from people.  Add a couple new pking area’s and… Try and make a working summoning skill.  If you have any questions or need any help doing this Pm me.  My servers ip is darkpk.no-ip.info.</p>
