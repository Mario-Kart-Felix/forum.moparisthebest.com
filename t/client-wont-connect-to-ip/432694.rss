    <title>Client won&#39;t connect to IP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-wont-connect-to-ip/432694</link>
    <description>I have changed the client.java file to my server IP. I have done it in every place in the client.java and in the gui and it is still not connecting to my server IP. The server is online, but the client still cannot connect. Any suggestions?</description>
