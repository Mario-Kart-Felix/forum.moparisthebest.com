    <description>The multi spells hit anyone regardless of their level in the wilderness. For example, If I&#39;m lvl 126 and I barrage a lvl 125 in 5 wild and there is a lvl 20 standing near us, the lvl 20 will also be hit. If I try to attack the lvl 20 directly, it will not work.

I do not want anyone outside of the lvl range being hit by magic. Any idea how to solve this?</description>
