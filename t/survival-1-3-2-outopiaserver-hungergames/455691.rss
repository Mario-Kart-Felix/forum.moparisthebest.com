General things about the server!
The server was setup up about 2 months ago..
The idea of making a server was firstly came up when 3 guys decided to make a LAN server to play minecraft together.
One day, 1 guy of the 3 recommended making the server public for all.
The idea was greatful so they start upgrading the server,they gave it a name..OUTOPIA..
The Outopia Server was a dream that became true for these guys.
&#39;&#39;Tons&#39;&#39; of work by them made a fabulous place for all the minecrafters...The server is still improving and attract more and more people..!!

Staff and website!
All staff recruited for Outopia have to pass a series of applications and interviews in order to make the cut. Any staff caught giving the player a hard time, wielding there power megalomaniac style or just simply not doing their job, will be dealt with in a fair manner.
