    <description>My post is more of a question than a problem.

I am using the U-Rune base by Kihomura, and I want it so that when I click on a portal, it will teleport me to wherever I specify.

So, would I put the case label in the ObjectClick class or somewhere else?
If it does go in the ObjectClick class, would it work if I put it under
[code]
public static void objectClick
[/code]?

Also, would the code to make it teleport from another base, say Allstar for example, work in the U-Rune base or am I going to have to make it from scratch?

Answers are appreciated. =]</description>
