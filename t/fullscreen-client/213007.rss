<p>[/code][/quote]<br>
The presence of javascript is completely independent of whether they use a java applet or not. While injecting the applet tags via javascript may speed things up the reason behind it is to prevent easy scrapping of pages. That is a huge hurdle for non-browser based bots.</p>

              <p>Doesn’t that just have a document.write("") etc etc? I think it allows the page to load, and the html to render, then it injects the applet tags into the html. That way the applet doesn’t load off to the side of the screen at first because the Java plugin freezes the browser and therefore the page rendering.</p>
