    <description>OK to start off im not an idiot. I have been running a server for over a year and have absouloutly no problems with an online situation. Recently my server has gone off line. But there is no reason why. So heres what i have checked.

Port forwarding
Port forwarded correctly, port 5555.

The port
Again still there havent touched it. Number 5555

Run.bat
It runs fine, nothing else coming up. It says Blazingrangerz Online.

No-ip.
Yup blazingrangerz.no-ip.org Set up fine. No update or re-submits required.

Internet Connection. 
Obviously im set up to internet correctly. If im posting here.

Client.java
Yup, blazingrangerz.no-ip.org And I havent touched anything like that recently.

Compiler. 
Compiles fine. No errors at all. 

So heres what I think. The no-ip beilevs my computer is still in use.( being connected to) Because it hasn&#39;t expired. I have internet, and the port is set up.
Either 
1: My internet host (comcast) Screwed me over
2:No-ip is screwing me over.
3: IM skipping a step
4: Something I might have recently done to my computer affected ports.

So yea.
I understand codes, so yes if theres something I need to know in codes. Hit me :D.
And I did add a &quot;Network Connection&quot; For my Iphone so I can check on the server wherever. I tried reversing it back, but I couldent find the network editor, just the network adder.

Please help if you have any idea. There a lot of confused players, and I have no answer.

You can pm me on my forums Blazingrangerz.com</description>

              <p>OK please read my whole post. This could plenty be a server problem.<br>
I know how to port forward. I know the static Ip. It is configured. I will repeat again, I have had a online server for over a year. Please dont send me to basics, its something more.</p>
