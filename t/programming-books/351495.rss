    <title>Programming books</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/programming-books/351495</link>
    <description>I know most of you are against buying books for programming, but I&#39;ve been to boarders and actually sat down for a good 30 minutes or so reading some of them. I think I&#39;m interested in books more than reading docs online. 

I have bought the Java in 24 hours from the &quot;Sams Teach Yourself&quot; series. So far it&#39;s pretty relative and it&#39;s clearing up a few things for me. So, I was wondering, from the bit of you that do read, what are some books that you suggest?</description>

              <p>[quote=“ziplock, post:2, topic:351495”]I want that book. How much did it cost?[/quote]It was $34.99, but I had the money to blow. It’s extensive, so I figure it was money well spent. It’s not like it has no use. I’ve already learned quite a bit.</p>
<p>[quote=“Adam, post:3, topic:351495”]It all depends on what you’re trying to learn Reaper. Also, books are a very biased subject. People base their opinions off whether or not they learned something from it. One person may have while the other person might not have. What you really need to do is figure out what you’re interested in learning, sit down at borders with a book that teaches that, read a few pages and see if it’s something that might be of use for you.[/quote]Yeah, I get what you’re saying ^-^. But it would be nice to get a few suggestions on where to find some good ones, because there are only a few at the Boarders we have.</p>
