    <title>A buzzer game script? good idea or bad? should i try?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-buzzer-game-script-good-idea-or-bad-should-i-try/5643</link>
    <description>it seems like it wouldnt be to hard, just REALLY tedious...... lol i need a script to script for me!!!!!!     ;D
anyway, if you think about it, you could have it set to where the mouse mouse smoothly following bitmaps, it would be a HUGE script, thats just the bitmap codes..... but anyway, think anyone would want it?  i&#39;m starting on it right now, it&#39;ll take a long time, perhaps an hour per level, but i have been bored lately, so ii&#39;m ready for a challenge :D i have to make a bitmap for every piece of the cord for each level, so if anybody is up to helping me code a few levels, i&#39;d be happy :D
i figured using coords would work too, but they seem easily detectable because it would just buzz straight through it..... eh, i&#39;ll try coding one level of each, see which is better :P
that&#39;s my idea, comments appreciated! :D</description>

              <p>yeah, i’m still new to neopets, but i’ve heard that they had color changing too…<br>
so bitmaps would be a bad idea?<br>
i guess i’ll try to do it with coordinates then… a bit more boring, but probably more bugfree <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
