<p>This made me giggle.<br>
Ruby earned his ranking for a reason, from the looks of it, he’s a better PHP programmer than you. This is a simple script that I could have done in a few minutes, literally. As for the other discussion about how it takes a certain amount of time to grasp a language. PHP takes years and years to master, and as Ruby stated, you learn along the way. I can easily say that I’m still learning, sure, I’ve done it for years now, and I do it professionally, however, I’m still figuring out better methods of doing something when programming. I could probably understand grasping HTML in a couple days, however, you’re still not going to learn all of the tags and correct usages or scenarios for them. It’s impossible to grasp PHP in two days.</p>
<p>And also, considering the fact that I was teaching you PHP, and it took a couple days to workout the main script of a log-in system with you.</p>

<p>I’d say It’ll take 1-2 days to learn get the gist of it and “years”? Could take under a month to actually seriously pro. Yeah it’ll take some dedication and daily practise but it is really simple stuff. I’m saying this over experience since I was taught in the most ‘loling’ way.[/quote]</p>
<p>Show us some work you’ve done then we can establish what sort of level you are at. Just because you know a language doesn’t make you a pro in that field. I can know Java but not be an expert at it.</p>

<p>Website development is in now way easy. For example; PHP may be easier to grasp than other languages. However, it still takes some serious work and dedication. I’d even go to the point of years of learning to become considered as a good programmer.</p>

<p>I primarily use Bootstrap and integrate forums to it, if you’re talking about the bare templates yes, they are the bootstrap default. If I was such a bad programmer I would never have been given the badge. I leeched one template a while back and I’ve managed to redeem myself. Don’t you think that Taharok and the staff check up before they go giving badges? In the end if they give someone a badge and its wrongly given it falls back on them. I was assigned a specific task and I completed that task to the standard required.</p>
