    <description>I need help trying to figure out how to put a client on a webs.com forum. Like i have it implemented, http://puu.sh/31ScR.jpg, but it says error connecting to server. It will not actually connect to it so I can play. I have seen it working on other webs websites, but i&#39;ve never tried to actually make it work myself. Can someone help? Private message me please. Or answer here
