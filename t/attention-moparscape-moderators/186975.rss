I thought that tutorials had to follow the Java conventions..

Yes, but the rules here aren&#39;t enforced. So anything works.[/quote]


I have to half agree with him. This is quoted from the tutorial section and proves a great point. There are only two moparscape mods that have any posts in the tutorials section, and not many even between them. Evil_ and Tico135 are the only ones with recorded statistics of posting inside of the tutorial section at all. This means Click Here has less than 2 posts in the tutorial section (assumed 0) and Ikiliki has less than 36 (assumed less than 10). Even Evil_ only has 29 total posts in the tutorial section. It looks to me as though Tico is the only moparscape mod doing anything inside the tutorial section. And, the moparscape boards are impossible to manage with a single moderator. I think that the other moderators need to start expanding on which boards they moderate to greatly reduce the quantity of moderating needed to manage this site.

Edit: And one other thing, one of you need to get out the noob stick and start hitting people in the balls. MoparScapers are thinking they can bend the rules again...</description>

<p>Why make rules so strict? Strict rules are unneeded. All you need is constantly active moderators (even for a few minutes a night, overall making more moderators necessary) who are willing to enforce those rules word-for-word. Their perception of the rules is also vital for punishments, otherwise a revolt of members could brew up.</p>
<p>And about the life lesson, these are teenagers. Unless they are not normal, they probably don’t dwell too much on life changing things.</p>

<p>People don’t realize how much of a life lesson forums like this can be. In any simple job, if you choose not to follow the rules, you choose to receive a punishment. Usually you’ll get a pay cut, or be fired, as you had no respect for the rules, and therefore your boss should have no respect for you. It should be the same way here. Nothing should change that.</p>

              <p>[quote=“TeleNubby, post:62, topic:186975”]Moparisthebest, you know as well as everyone else that Click Here doesnt moderate <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> anymore. So, just putting it out there, why is he still part of the staff?</p>
<p>Taharok, ‘cheat clients’ do help the RS2 private <span class="bbcode-i">server</span> field. The client does things it is not supposed to - and its up to the server owner to fix that. Getting rid of the security holes and vulnerabilities is learning, I assume? Well, its definitely a step up from the present. I thought we <span class="bbcode-i">wanted</span> the people here to learn things and be more creative. <span class="bbcode-b">It’s NOT going to happen IF WE DONT push them into doing it.</span></p>
<p>I also agree with the reset on the Dev/Help and MS Question boards. And if possible, the whole forum. I understand and I see where you’re coming from when you regarded this suggestion earlier, but think about it. Before our newly appointed staff for these boards, Ikiliki and occasionally Silab were the only ones who really moderated the forum. It was hard to keep up with the constant rule-breaking. So many posts were made that did not follow the guidelines, and they are still constantly being brought back up from the grave by users. They’re not needed topics anymore - there’s no point. In addition, the users registered here continue to break the rules, thinking that some are not enforced as well as they should be and ignoring the punishments that can be given. If we had an entire forum reset, then we could start clean. Enforce the rules as best as possible - not letting any of the rule-breaking occur, and letting the community know how it’s done from here on out. I dunno, I just felt like commenting on that.</p>
<p>Also, <span class="bbcode-i">why</span> do the forums crash after a ban is made? And <span class="bbcode-i">why</span> would it be so hard to fix?[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s completely an admin decision to demod Click Here. I do not see anything wrong with him as a person, but he just really doesn’t do anything for MoparScape. If it were me I would ask him if he had anything wrong with being demodded for the good of the site. If he said he was going to start being more active that would be fully ok, but if he realizes that he’s not going to be more active, I think he is a good enough of a person to say yes. However I would leave his vet position, it’s doing no wrong. That’s just my opinion, but I have no control over it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>As Moparisthebest has said cheat clients are not against the rules as this a cheating community, but I don’t like the factor when someone impersonates azn and posts the client. That’s when we have to draw the line. We can’t overally push them, and I don’t see an overall superb way of doing it, but if you have an idea, I’d post it so we can discuss it.</p>
<p>I don’t really know about a reset of the MoparScape Client Questions Section and Development/Help, but again, as Moparisthebest has stated a reset will not happen again. The only thing that we can do against the factor of people pulling up dead topics is warning/muting them when they do something like that. They should already know that is not allowed, we should not have to tell them.</p>

<p>I agree that we need more moderators for moparscape, but as Lothy mentioned earlier, finding trustworthy members that are from <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> is fairly hard to do, there are certainly trustworthy members on the forums, but most aren’t active at all at <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> and therefore would not make good moderators for it.</p>

<p>Ikiliki and I are as active as we can, Evil_ has school and being a fireman, Silab is to busy making money :P, and Click Here is just going through college so we do what we can.</p>
