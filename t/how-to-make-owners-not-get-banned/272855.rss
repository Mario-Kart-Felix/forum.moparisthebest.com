OK,here is something for you, people have access to “cheat” clients, some of these makes you owner, admin ect! which then they could ban. he wants to make it so HE can’t get banned incase of one of these or a freak incident.<br>

you will need to do something like this…(in your ban code)</p>
<p>[code]<br>
<em>make statment that has “if ^playername^”</em><br>
<em>rest of code ladadada</em><br>
if (otherPIndex != -1) {<br>
client p = (client) server.playerHandler.players[otherPIndex];</p>
<pre><code>		writeLog(p.playerName, "bans"); //delete this probably o.o
		p.disconnected = false;
</code></pre>
<p>[/code][/quote]</p>
<p>Wrong. Cheat clients only make u display as staff on your screen they dont give you any powers.</p>
