    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-urgent-help/429399</link>
    <description>[b]While I was playing RuneScape, I saw that someone logged into my brother&#39;s account, he wasn&#39;t on it as he was right next to me.
They said &quot;This is my account&quot;, &quot;I own this account&quot; and the last thing they said was &quot;Thanks for the stuff - Bye!&quot;.
Something like that anyway.
Basically, he doesn&#39;t share his password, use stupid websites where he can share personal info like email and stuff.
His account had members items on it like some dragon and Toxz stuff what ever it is...
He isn&#39;t a member anymore but somehow they managed to trade members items in a non-members world, which I swear you can&#39;t do.
My friend was recently hacked and keylogged but he is paying for a proxy bouncer to keep his computer safe, and my brother did go on his computer to play, but he didn&#39;t hack it either as he was right next to us.
I was wondering if I maybe have a keylogger or something as we last logged into that account ages ago.
His password was pretty hard to guess aswell, no one knew his user or anything.
Can someone let me know how I can securely log into my account without being hacked? I may have to transfer my items incase I get hacked aswell.

Help will be greatly appreciated and if this in the wrong Section, sorry.
Cheers.[/b]</description>

I just dont want to risk logging in and losing stuff.[/quote]Trojans are always harmless, until a client tries to connect with them for gathering information like your keyboard logs,…<br>
So basically, that Trojan means your computer is/was a zombie for as long as you were infected, a zombie that waited for instructions of his master (the hacker) whenever he feels/felt like it, to hand over logs about ex. your keyboard. This meaning that, apart from your RS account, he might have gotten his hands on some other information.</p>
<p>You really can’t tell if it’s harmless or not, Trojans don’t tend to stand out, not even if they are active. They are always active, but I mean when a successful connection is made between a server and a client. They are really subtle so I’d change all my passwords if I were you.</p>
<p>You were being watched buddy, ever felt like someone was watching you when you were not looking? It probably was that Trojan.<br>
What I’d do is not delete the Trojan right away and trace the hacker.</p>

Np,<br>
I’m guessing that Trojan could most likely be the cause for your brother getting hacked. I reckon that your computer should be safe now. But if you want to wait for more responses to this topic then go ahead. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

and most new keyloggers don’t get picked up by an antivirus<br>
check your processes if there is something in it that shouldn’t be there</p>
