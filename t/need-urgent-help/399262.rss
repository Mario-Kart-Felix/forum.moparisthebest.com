    <title>Need URGENT Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-urgent-help/399262</link>
    <description>Ok, I&#39;ve now made a server named, Galaxy 3D. Me and my friend decided to create this yesterday and I have been working on everything for about 10 hours in total. It has taken countless trial and error, tutorials, and just plain common sense. I think I have everything ready to go. I&#39;ve already port forwarded and the thing I am having the most trouble with is changing the ip. So let me start off with asking this noob question, would the place to change the ip be in the client or the source. I have tried many things I have seen and have been suggested. Some being finding the client.java and open it with word pad and Ctrl+F and search for &quot;server=&quot; &quot;ip.&quot; Also searched for that on port (43594 or something) 127.0.0.1. EVERYTHING! Also searched in GUI.java and EGUI.java. This is upsetting me terribly. Anyone who can explain a little more in depth or help me out if you have teamviewer and/or add my msn: sethfrias@gmail.com

Thank you</description>

              <p>Search, ‘127.0.0.1’ or ‘0.0.0.0’ in Gui.java, or client.java</p>
<p>It most likely is in Gui.java, so just scroll down if non of that works. and just search ‘server’ nothing more, nothing less.</p>
