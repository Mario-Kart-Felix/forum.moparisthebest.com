    <description>Ok, So i&#39;m using Umairscape Ip Changer Client.. And my friend tells me about This server [I will not post ip] .. So i log on and its cool and everything.. I go to go on it later.. The client doesnt work.. Is stuck at Connecting to Update server.. Me guessin that meant it was offline.. My Friend then tells me that he is online.. And i still cant get on from now.. Yet he can.. it is always stuck at Connecting To Update Server.. And in the black box that runs with the client it says: error_game_js5connect

Can anyone help me?</description>
