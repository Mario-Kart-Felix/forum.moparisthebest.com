    <title>Router Assistance and Device Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/router-assistance-and-device-problem/397403</link>
    <description>Alright, I&#39;m having a hard time with NETGEAR customer support because we don&#39;t have warranty, and frankly don&#39;t have a card to hand to them, so we can&#39;t get customer support.

So I&#39;m having a problem with the router, and it seems to be not sending out Wi-Fi signals to like the Xbox, Labtop etc., and I&#39;ve tried a lot of things to see if it would work but seems to not be working...

So does someone have a suggestion?
--------------------------------------------------------
I&#39;m having a problem with my music device and it seems to not be working when I plug the cord that goes into the tower of the desktop or my USB port, and then plugging the other end of the USB cable into the music device, it seems to not open up the media files that I need to either add or delete music from.

I&#39;ve even tried to format it with connecting it to the Xbox, and formatting it into Xbox hardware, but then that didn&#39;t even register. So I hooked it up to my desktop, and not even that worked. So I&#39;m asking, what else should I do? I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong, and this device is pretty well new, I&#39;ve never really used it as much as before though.</description>
