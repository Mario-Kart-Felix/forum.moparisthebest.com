    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/berserker-necklase/194047</link>
    <description>This is Basicly a little code i put together into my server, it isnt the best but i enjoy it

Now im hoping you guys can enjoy it to.

This tutorial is meant to teach people, how to add voids to there weapons, how to add random effects and how to limit those effects

First thing we gota do is open up our client.java

Now we need to add the void for our necklase

So we search for [code]public class client extends Player implements Runnable {[/code]

And press enter once, we are now ready to start.

[size=15pt]Adding The Necklase Void[/size]

Here we first need to start our void

We enter the code [code]public void YOUVOIDNAME() {[/code]

For my example i have naimed the void &quot;berserk&quot;

So i have entered [code]public void berserk() {[/code]

Next we need to set the server to know that we only want our strength increased, when we are wielding the maul, the necklase, and it is a random time in combat

To do this we add a [code]misc.random[/code], this bascily means if you are in combat you have a 1\% chance of gaining the berserker effect

I am going to use the number [code]10[/code] for a 1\10 chance of doing the effect

So you will need to press enter once at the end of your[code]public void berserk() {[/code]

And add in  [code]if(misc.random(CHANCEYOUWANT) == 1[/code] You need to change where i have written CHANCEYOUWANT to the number you would like, i am going to use 10 as stated above

So for the example so far i will have

[code]public void berserk() {
if(misc.random(10) == 1 [/code]

But now we need to add the part that will tell the server, that this will only work if we are wearing the berserker necklase and maul, so we use the sign &amp;&amp; to tell the server we need the misc.random to land on the right number AND we want the player to be wielding maul and necklase, we write it like this.

 [code]&amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 6528  &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerAmulet] == 15087 [/code]

That is saying that we need our weapon to be 6528 (tzhaar-ket-om) and our amulet to be 15087 (Berserker Necklase)

So we add that after our  [code]if(misc.random(CHANCEYOUWANT) == 1[/code]

like this [code]if(misc.random(CHANCEYOUWANT) == 1 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == WEAPONID  &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerAmulet] == AMULETID[/code]

You can change where it says playerWeapon or Amulet to whatever you like,

We now press enter once and add a [code]{[/code]

This is telling the server if those variables are all there it will do the next part

So your code so far should look like this 

[code]if(misc.random(CHANCEYOUWANT) == 1 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == WEAPONID  &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerAmulet] == AMULETID)
	        {
[/code]

And for my example it shows [code]public void berserk() {
if(misc.random(10) == 1 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 6528 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerAmulet] == 15087)
	        {[/code]

Now we move onto adding in the effect

Firstly, lets add a message *OPTIONAL*

This bit is simple, you tell the server to send the player a message when the effect has activated

For the example i will use this

[code]sendMessage(&quot;Your necklase increses your strength.&quot;);[/code]

Or you can use 

[code]sendMessage(&quot;YOURMESSAGEHERE.&quot;);[/code]

Now onto making the GFX when the effect is activated

For this we use what is called a stillgfx, this means a gfx that is not travelling about

I am going to use the gfx id = 246 , the id for a red glow

so after my message, if i have decided to include one i need to type in 

[code]stillgfx(246, absY, absX);[/code]

Let me explain, the 246 is the id of the gfx you want

And the absY and absX are where you want it

if i were to put  [code]stillgfx(246, absY-1, absX);[/code]

It would put the GFX one place less than my coordinate on the Y axis

Now the main part, making the necklase increase your strength

Here we have to make the server increase your playerlevel2 (strength)

We do this like this

[code]playerLevel[2] += AMOUNTRASIEDBY;[/code]

So Your code should now look like this

[code]
public void YOURVOIDNAME() {
if(misc.random(CHANCEYOUWANT) == 1 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == WEAPONID  &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerAmulet] == AMULETID)
	        {
sendMessage(&quot;YOURMESSAGEHERE.&quot;);
stillgfx(YOURGFXID, absY, absX);
playerLevel[2] += AMOUNTRASIEDBY; 
[/code]

For my example it is now showing 

[code]public void berserk() {
if(misc.random(10) == 1 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 6528  &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerAmulet] == AMULETID)
	{
sendMessage(&quot;Your necklase increses your strength.&quot;);
stillgfx(246, absY, absX);
playerLevel[2] += 20;[/code]

meaning that only when all the variables are correct it will send my message, the gfx and increase your strength

Lastly in the void we will add The code telling the server to recognise the changes

This is simply done by adding [code]updateRequired = true;[/code]

And then we finish off by adding two symbols to end it, your code once finished will look like this

[code]public void YOURVOIDNAME() {
if(misc.random(CHANCEYOUWANT) == 1 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == WEAPONID)
	{
sendMessage(&quot;YOURMESSAGE.&quot;);
stillgfx(GFXID, absY, absX);
playerLevel[2] += AMOUNTTOADD;                              
updateRequired = true;
	        }
}[/code]

And for my example


[code]public void berserk() {
if(misc.random(10) == 1 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 6528 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerAmulet] == 15087)
	{
sendMessage(&quot;Your necklase increses your strength.&quot;);
stillgfx(246, absY, absX);
playerLevel[2] += 20;                              
updateRequired = true;
	        }
}[/code]

And thats us finished the void, now we need a second void *Im going to explain this 1 a bit faster lol*

We now need a void to make sure the bonus has a limit, so that people dont end up with 999 strength 

so we leave a space after our void we just made 

And add [code]public void SECONDVOIDID() {[/code]

Now we will need to tell the server if the players strength goes over a certain number, while the playerweapon and playeramulet are the same as what they were in your first void, it will set it back to before the limit like so

[code]public void overBerserk() {
if(playerLevel[2] &gt;= 250 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 6528 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerAmulet] == 15087)
	{
sendMessage(&quot;Your necklases effect will not boost you over 250 str.&quot;);
stillgfx(247, absY, absX);
playerLevel[2] = 249;                              
updateRequired = true;
	        }
}[/code]

That is my code for it, yours should be set out like so

[code]public void YOURSECONDVOIDNAME() {
if(playerLevel[2] &gt;= LEVELLIMIT &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == WEAPONID &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerAmulet] == AMULET ID)
	{
sendMessage(&quot;YOURMESSAGE.&quot;);
stillgfx(GFXID, absY, absX); //here i have 247 which is a blue glow
playerLevel[2] = YOURLEVELLIMIT-1;                              
updateRequired = true;
	        }
}[/code]


Now to add the voids so that they actualy work

We have to search for [code]6528[/code] which is the weapon id of tzhaar ket om, if your using a different weapon search for its id

You will have to search a few times until you come across a list with codes like this

[code]if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == (6528)) //obby maul
{
PkingDelay = 5;
wepdelay = 5;
}[/code]

One you have found this you simply add under your [code]wepdelay[/code]

The name of your to voids, so my code looks like this

[code]if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == (6528)) //obby maul
{
PkingDelay = 5;
wepdelay = 5;
berserk();
overBerserk();
}

[/code]

You now have the effect working *Against players*

Now you once again search your weapon id 

Until you find a code that looks exactly like the one you have just changed, 

This is the wepondelays for your weapon against npcs

All you need to do is the exact same as above, add your two void names

[code]if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == (6528)) //obby maul
{
PkingDelay = 5;
wepdelay = 5;
berserk();
overBerserk();
}

[/code]

And yours would look like 

[code]if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == (WEAPONID)) //obby maul
{
PkingDelay = YOURDELAY;
wepdelay = SAMEASABOVE;
YOURFIRSTVOIDNAME();
YOURSECONDVOIDNAME();
}

[/CODE]

Now when you are attacking a player or npc , with all the variables correct your strength will increase upto your limit, on a random timer
------------------------

This tutorial was made 100% by me, it is my second tutorial

I am not the best coder, and this is not the hardest bit of coding, but you can never explain to much 

Good Luck and Best Wishes

updateRequired = true;

<p>One you have found this you simply add under your <code>wepdelay</code></p>
<p>The name of your to voids, so my code looks like this</p>
<p>[code]if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == (6528)) //obby maul<br>
{<br>
PkingDelay = 5;<br>
wepdelay = 5;<br>
berserk();<br>
overBerserk();<br>
}</p>
<p>[/code]</p>
<p>You now have the effect working <em>Against players</em></p>
<p>Now you once again search your weapon id</p>
<p>Until you find a code that looks exactly like the one you have just changed,</p>
<p>This is the wepondelays for your weapon against npcs</p>
<p>All you need to do is the exact same as above, add your two void names</p>
<p>[code]if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == (6528)) //obby maul<br>
{<br>
PkingDelay = 5;<br>
wepdelay = 5;<br>
berserk();<br>
overBerserk();<br>
}</p>
<p>[/code]</p>
<p>And yours would look like</p>
<p>[code]if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == (WEAPONID)) //obby maul<br>
{<br>
PkingDelay = YOURDELAY;<br>
wepdelay = SAMEASABOVE;<br>
YOURFIRSTVOIDNAME();<br>
YOURSECONDVOIDNAME();<br>
}</p>
<p>[/CODE]</p>
<h2>Now when you are attacking a player or npc , with all the variables correct your strength will increase upto your limit, on a random timer</h2>
<p>This tutorial was made 100% by me, it is my second tutorial</p>
<p>I am not the best coder, and this is not the hardest bit of coding, but you can never explain to much</p>
<p>Good Luck and Best Wishes<br>
