    <description>I was fixing some stuff in class9.java and after awhile of doing alot of things I compiled and got 100 errors Is there any way to use eclipse or some other programs to locate errors in java? Even though eclipse does pickup errors in java files it doesnt for any of my server files idk y even if i just hit enter and type a thousand &quot;}&quot;s it wouldnt show the red x next to the line number like it would showing me theres an errors there. I have no idea where my errors is and so I Need this.</description>
