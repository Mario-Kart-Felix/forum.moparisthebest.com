    <title>Beware of paypal scam</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/beware-of-paypal-scam/353947</link>
    <description>I just received this email from:

&lt;blockquote&gt;August 9, 2010: We have reasons to believe that your account was accessed by a third party. Because protecting the security of your account is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection.
OPEN AND COMPLETE THE FORM ATTACHED IN THIS MESSAGE TO REGAIN ACCESS TO YOUR ACCOUNT.

Also when you will complete the document we have sent, remember to ALLOW javascript to run from the bar that will pop-up,
otherwise we cannot verify the informations you have provided.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There was an attached form, and from first glanced it looked legitimate, but closer looking and I realized that all of the button groups were actually images, from some random IP. Here is what the scam page looks like:
[img]http://img227.imageshack.us/img227/3596/scam.png[/img]
Notice that the entire group there is one image. If you get this page, EVER, report it to your email provider (so they can hopefully trace the email)

I also have reason to believe that the person doing this got my email from this site, because the only people that know I have a server (which is the only way I do anything with paypal) are from here.

Be careful everyone!

NOTE: The person is using PHP xMailer, so it WILL say it&#39;s from PayPal! Don&#39;t be fooled!</description>

<p>No decent site will EVER send you an attached form to fill out, they will instead LINK you to a form on their SECURE website.[/quote]Yea, I get those all the time, but then even some of them are scams. Like it will be the same mesage as what I have, but instead of attaching the form, it will say:</p>
<blockquote>Visit our site and fill out the form to verify your account: [url=http://SCAMWEBSITE.com]http://www.PayPal.com/verify/~verifyform.php[/url]</blockquote> (click the link to see what I mean)
<p>That’s when you have to make sure you double check the address bar of wherever you visit.</p>

<p>Yea, I double checked the real paypal because it seemed suspicious.</p>

For once, Krackkid did the site on his own. Normally it was me creating it, and Krackkid just being an Admin. I can say, since he used that theme, instead of the normal SMF Default, it looks much better.</p>

              <p>I just received this email from:</p>
<blockquote>August 9, 2010: We have reasons to believe that your account was accessed by a third party. Because protecting the security of your account is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection.
OPEN AND COMPLETE THE FORM ATTACHED IN THIS MESSAGE TO REGAIN ACCESS TO YOUR ACCOUNT.
<p>Also when you will complete the document we have sent, remember to ALLOW javascript to run from the bar that will pop-up,<br>
otherwise we cannot verify the informations you have provided.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was an attached form, and from first glanced it looked legitimate, but closer looking and I realized that all of the button groups were actually images, from some random IP. Here is what the scam page looks like:<br>
<img src="http://img227.imageshack.us/img227/3596/scam.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
Notice that the entire group there is one image. If you get this page, EVER, report it to your email provider (so they can hopefully trace the email)</p>
<p>I also have reason to believe that the person doing this got my email from this site, because the only people that know I have a server (which is the only way I do anything with paypal) are from here.</p>
<p>Be careful everyone!</p>
<p>NOTE: The person is using PHP xMailer, so it WILL say it’s from PayPal! Don’t be fooled!</p>
