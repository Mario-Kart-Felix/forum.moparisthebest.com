    <description>Hi, I have portforwarded downloaded No-IP 2 months ago. But my No-IP does&#39;nt work anymore, who can help me.

IP is dspk.no-ip.biz does&#39;nt work, I made to a new IP but that IP does&#39;nt work to.

              <p>Make sure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your running your server (runserver.bat)</li>
<li>Your NO-IP Duc is running.</li>
<li>Sometimes your router MIGHT have a dynamic IP (for example mine changes from 192.168.2.1 to 192.168.2.2, if thats the case you might need to re-portforward)</li>
</ul>
<p>And when YOU are logging in, don’t type in the no-ip, leave it blank for the IP. The only people who have to use the NO-IP     are the people who play it excluding you.</p>
