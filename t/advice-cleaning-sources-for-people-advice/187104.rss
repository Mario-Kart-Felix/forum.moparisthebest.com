    <title>[Advice?] Cleaning sources for people.. [Advice?]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/advice-cleaning-sources-for-people-advice/187104</link>
    <description>Heya all.

Just came to my senses, when making a server i came to think;

&quot;what am i doing this for?&quot;
&quot;why when i cannot host?&quot;

So i thought long and hard, i thinik it&#39;s fun and exciting to code servers, but because i cannot host, the most i could host would be like 5 - 10hours on weekend days.

Right, so basically what i want from you members is a bit of support, ideas (suggestions) and then i can be doing some requests, getting rep hopefully. Etc.

So basically all i want you guys to do is take a little time lookign at sources you think *could* be good for a starter, and then post them here, download link if possible. And then i can pick sources to clean &amp; Release!

I hope all my work from now on helps all you guys, coding / &quot;need a clean source&quot; etc.

Also when you post a source for me to clean pick a suitable for me to name this, once i&#39;ve cleaned it.

So here&#39;s what you should post:

[tt]Source name:
Source Download link: (if av.)
Requested name: (This is the name you want it to be called after been cleaned)
Name: (your member name, goes into the source to say you recommended it to be cleaned)
Other info: (self-explanotory)
[/tt]

Thanks to all who support and suggest me :D
