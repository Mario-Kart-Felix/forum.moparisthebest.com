<p>Actually it isn’t… The interface handling for buying/selling at the shops is using the old interfaces from previous Matrix versions (711?). You need to go in and change up the interface handling to work with the new Shops. Not sure if it is an anti-leech or maybe they never got around to working with shops – or hell maybe I am wrong all together. But Shops.java isn’t missing the buy/sell functions. They are there.<br>

<p>Wow haha, I just went back and found them. My bad; also, I knew something was up with the interfaces. But what I think happened is when Dragonkk went to got steal the most up-to-date version of Matrix from his developer, he must’ve not gotten the most up-to-date Matrix source lol. Since in the actual Matrix being hosted, the shops interface does work.[/quote]</p>
<p>Are you sure that the Matrix interfaces worked when they were hosting it? I just fixed the shop interfaces and it works almost flawlessly – I can’t be fucked to set up all the interface buttons and shit right now. And I looked at the RSPS that the Matrix website redirects you to now and it uses the Matrix base but it is a spawn server and shops are also broken in that one.</p>
<p>Anyway. I fixed the shops you just need to fix up the Shop.java and send the correct configuration for the Shop interface. I might make a post about it if someone hasn’t already.</p>
