    <title>Need help designing client. (REVISED)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-designing-client-revised/201718</link>
    <description>Hey, I am trying to make it so that I can use my client with my source. I am using the muhascape source but I will try and find a new one after this is complete. I mostly want it for the &quot;new&quot; RS game interface. The client base I am using is Galkons Client Base. If someone could help me with this it would make me very happy!  :)


 :) Thanks- Kevin  :)</description>
