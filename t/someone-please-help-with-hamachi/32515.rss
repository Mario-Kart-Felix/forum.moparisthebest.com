    <title>Someone please help with hamachi!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/someone-please-help-with-hamachi/32515</link>
    <description>I try to start and it keeps saying:
[code]
Failed to configure hamachi network adapter.

Configuration Problem is most likely caused by your firewalling software
blocking DHCP traffic on hamachi adapter. Please make sure that UDP
traffic from local port 68 to port 67 at 5.0.0.1 is allowed. Alternatively
you can try completely disabling the firewall on hamachi adapter.

If neither of the above help or you dont understand this message, visit
our support forums, report the problem and you will get help.

Would you like Hamachi to keep trying to configure the adapter while
you adjust your firewall settings?

                         YES                                         NO
[/code]
 :eek: :confused: :eek: :confused:
I&#39;ve been using hamachi since this spring and it has worked fine!
Can some one help with this mysterious error??</description>
