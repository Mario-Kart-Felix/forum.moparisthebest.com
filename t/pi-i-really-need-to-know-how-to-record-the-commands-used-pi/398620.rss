    <description>Some of my admins and some of my players keep accusing people of things. The admins are accusing people of things that are un-allowed such as autoing. Then, the admins stories don&#39;t match the ones of the players. The players said the admins were muting and jailing them and i have NO IDEA what to believe. I know some servers have this...so, I would like to record what commands are said. Like what player used them and what command they used!

HELP PLEASE!</description>

              <p>Uhm i’m taking a stab at this, but you can maybe edit chat logs or ban logs to keep a record of commands, maybe experiment a little bit with it.</p>
