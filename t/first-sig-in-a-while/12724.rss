Some notes on it...the render is actually at 100%, I only remembered it didn&#39;t have to be in black and white (I was half asleep when I made it), and it is almost purely defaults, I used 3 brushes in it. Now that I look at it, I realize I forgot to put my name on it...oh well, if anyone wants it, I&#39;ll post the .psd because I&#39;m too lazy to open PS again...Anyways, rate /10</description>
