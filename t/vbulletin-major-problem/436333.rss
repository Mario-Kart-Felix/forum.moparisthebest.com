    <title>Vbulletin major problem!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vbulletin-major-problem/436333</link>
    <description>Hello, i didn&#39;t know where to post this question but i need someone who is familiar with vbulletin 4.1&#39;s help. I was going through trying to fix my counters and somehow i messed something up on there and all the different forum posts and the different forum subjects are mixed up. Like for example if i open the news&amp;announcement and click on one it put the news posted and mixed it with another recent thread posted. This is a horrible issue and i&#39;m new to vbulletin i could really use as much help as someone could give me! THANK YOU!</description>
