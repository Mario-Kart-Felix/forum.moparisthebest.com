    <title>Little Big Planet</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/little-big-planet/241334</link>
    <description>Well i got my copy of it today(day early woot) and i must say it is astounding, the sheer amount of things for you to collect is great, the editability of the levels are amazing, unfortuantely the connecting is bad but i&#39;ve put this down to two things A) everyone who has got their copy today is logging in and B) my shitty internet but i did get to play some levels and i find some of them ingenious the fun that can be had from such a simple idea is amazing. The customizing of sackboy is probably one of my favourite aspects of it, my little sister finds amusing she always trys to make the sack boy match :P I am actually loving the game and am enjoying the taxing little puzzles that are in there and made me stop and think for a while. The Customisation of the pod could be better and there are quite a few glitches and unpolished textures but great apart from that 9/10</description>

              <p>I’m sure the connection problems will be sorted since it ran perfectly in the beta, they’ve obviously just underestimated the load they would be getting.</p>
<p>Anyway, i don’t have a clue where these unpolished graphics are, either you are totally missing the point of the art style or there is something wrong with your copy.</p>
