              <p>Add this into your client.java</p>
<p><code>if (playerIsMember == 0 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerWeapon] &gt; 0)
        {
            remove(playerEquipment[playerWeapon], 3);
            sendMessage("You have to be a member to wield this.");
            dropsitem = false;
        }</code><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">This is for the weapon slot. If you want to change the slot, just change playerWeapon to the slot you choose.</span></p>
<p>Thats the easy way to do it… if you want the more complicated way, I’ll be making a tutorial on it. This code removes the slot as soon as you put it on, but there is still a delay. With the tut I give, the server won’t even allow you to wield it to begin with.</p>
