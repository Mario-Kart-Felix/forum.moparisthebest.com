    <description>Ok well I am re-doing my slayer shop and when I was done adding the items the prices were way to high so I went to &quot;prices&quot; but it only gave me the price as if I were to sell it in coins so it was &quot;id of item&quot; and &quot;32m was the amount in coins&quot; but in the slayer shop its 2,500 slayer points and I want it to be lower how can I change that to like 1,000 slayer points?</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>go to shopassistant.java and type in the item id if the item you want to lower,lets say ur doing armadyl gs which is 11694 so it will say "case 11694:<br>
return 2500;</p>
<p>so the case is your item id and the return value is the amount the item sells for in the shop. there ya go!</p>
