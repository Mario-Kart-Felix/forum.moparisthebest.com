    <description>Hey Moparscape Community! So I have been trying to learn to code a little bit and I really enjoy it and would like to learn more and have some work done to my little server I have been testing around on it is a deathlypvpz v3 I know people do not like it but I personally enjoy it and like to learn and test stuff on it I have attempted doing all of the things in the list below but just seem to not be able to quite make it work. If you can do any of the following items in Client,Source or Website send me a message or reply to this post and we will make it happen. NOTE: YOU DO NOT NEED TO KNOW ALL OF THE FOLLOWING STUFF I WANT TO LEARN AND HAVE DONE just if you can do even one of the things stated below then I am happy to pay you just to get it knocked off the list. Looking for permanent staff/tutor as well if you are interested or not in teaching me the round about of coding just even to the point you telling me how to do it over skype.

I want to be taught as well while you add the content.

Things I want to learn and be taught on the way:

CLIENT:

-(I would like to have the client have a nice looking launcher where it has multiple buttons which can redirect you to forums or voting area or will launch the game)

-Would like the client to have an updated login screen where there is a moving animation in the background

-Just in short I would like to have the client looking really nice

-Working world map

-Like to have mod/owner icons over staff players and would like there icons on the minimap.

-Would like more custom icons as well on the minimap such as bank icons in certain area and e.t.c

SOURCE:
-Deathlypvpz v3 glitches patched up.

-Would like to have working ::vote and ::claim working

-When you have a summoned NPC and it gets stuck behind a while it will teleport to you and there will be the same npc left behind pictures will be uploaded oh what I am talking about.

-Some fun custom minigames and quests would be great.

WEBSITE: 

-would like to have a good looking website and forums. one that is connected to the server that will have a working highscore system.

-working donating system


EXTRA:

Have a unique idea? I will pay on anything that would look cool to add to the server custom items, npcs, pets, and interfaces. like teleporting tabs and interfaces that will be nice looking! 

MORE INFO: 
So you can send me messages/pictures of some work you have done client,source or website sided. 
And again I would really like to learn everything that is changed or added to the server. 

I know this is a lot everyone I am totally aware I just want to learn that is all and have some guidance through the whole process so please message me I am online a lot and will get back to you all as soon as possible thanks!</description>

<p>I suggest making another topic that doesn’t offer a reward. We have these rules for a reason. I’ll leave most of your content untouched because it looks like you’ve put a bit of effort into asking for help.</p>
<p>I also highly suggest thinking about posting in a dev team section</p>
