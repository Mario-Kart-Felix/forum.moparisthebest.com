    <title>Earth Hour 2011</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/earth-hour-2011/385313</link>
    <description>So I just found out about this, but it sounds really interesting.  Apparently it was started in 2007, and this will mark the 5th time world wide.  Basically, as many people as possible are trying to shut off their lights for one hour world-wide in a global movement.  In Singapore, they&#39;re we&#39;ll be having a public walk during this hour and everyone is invited to do so, last year [B]128 countries[/B] participated in this dark hour and walk.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Earth Hour started in 2007 in Sydney, Australia when 2.2 million individuals turned their lights off for one hour to take a stand against climate change. Only a year later and Earth Hour had become a global sustainability movement with more than 50 million people across 35 countries participating.

In March 2009, hundreds of millions of people in 88 countries took part in the third Earth Hour, making Earth Hour 2009 the world’s largest global climate change initiative.

The same year, in Singapore, thousands of people, hundreds of businesses and our island landmarks and icons - the Singapore Flyer, the Merlion, the Fullerton Hotel, Esplanade Theatres etc... - all switched off their lights for the first time.

In 2010, Earth Hour became the biggest Earth Hour ever. A record 128 countries and territories joined the global display of climate action. Iconic buildings and landmarks from Asia Pacific to Europe and Africa to the Americas switched off. People across the world from all walks of life turned off their lights and came together in celebration and contemplation of the one thing we all have in common – our planet.

Earth Hour 2011 will take place on Saturday 26 March at 8.30PM (Singapore time).

This year Earth Hour will become Earth Hour + seeking action not just for 1 hour, but commitment to ongoing change. We want to capture what is being done, the change that is taking place in our world and allow these actions to inspire more action.

Big or small, every action counts because together our actions add up. Imagine what is achievable if we all go beyond the hour.

So save the date and sign up now.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This will be happening at [B][U]8:30 PM, Saturday 26 March 2011[/U][/B].

The official site: [URL=http://&quot;http://earthhour.wwf.sg/index.php&quot;]http://earthhour.wwf.sg/index.php[/URL]

I&#39;ll sure has hell be in on this, and I&#39;ve referred all the friends/family I know to sign up on their site.  I personally have friends in 5 countries who will be participating.  I&#39;ll be cloning this post to SRL, Dodian, Rune-Server, Mopar, and Sythe. (This is the first one made, SRL  :cool:)  Please, please refer your friends and family and join us on this date.

PS, watch the video they have, it&#39;s amazing all the places they turned off last year. ;)</description>

<p>I don’t know. Computers are much more useful than TV and Radio, and they’re potentially much more important.  I agree with these countries declaring access to a computer and the internet a human right. There is much talk from the government here that they see it as a human right, but as far as I know, there is nothing set in stone to state that.</p>

<p>An old article, but apparently internet is a human right in Finland and Estonia. You’ll need something to access the internet, so perhaps they can’t take away your computer either?</p>
