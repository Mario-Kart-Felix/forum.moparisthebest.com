<p>What happens if you disable UPnP?  It might screw with some other apps but it really shouldn’t.  You could always set up Qos to give you most of the bandwidth (by throttling your family)[/quote]<br>
What exactly does UPnP allow people on the network do? Remember I still have to use the network, so don’t want to stop myself from running any half-interesting programs.</p>
<p>I could setup QoS but I don’t think that’d be too useful, because it’d just allow them to use all the available bandwidth which would be about 90% and it’s not really the performance hit I’m worried about, it’s the fact that BT automatically throttle the entire internet connection when people torrent frequently. If I could use QoS to reduce their speed to like 10kbps or a small percentage of available bandwidth, that’d be good because BT’s automated system wouldn’t class that as heavy file sharing.</p>
