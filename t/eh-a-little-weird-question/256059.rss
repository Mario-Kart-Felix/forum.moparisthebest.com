    <title>-eh, a little weird question-</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/eh-a-little-weird-question/256059</link>
    <description>Alright well i released my v2 server the other day, and well, i had around 20 players. So i turned my server on and every 5 minutes people logged onto my server, i was wondering WTF.

So i went to the moparscape status and clicked on the downfall HD 508, and there the answer was, the guy has the same IP as me!

So here we have 5 people joining every 2 minutes complaining about not being able to move, because they are silab or another client, how does this work, my best bets are to change my ip to something else considering im hosting my server on my ip address not a no-ip, yet he&#39;s hosting it on the same ip, but it&#39;s not being hosted on my computer.

HOW DOES THIS WORK, people are conencting to mine, with silab when his says it&#39;s 508. This is extra weird, and if anyone can help me that would be great, even suggestions, or anything :P, thanks!</description>

              <p>Well there is no way the person has the same IP. And if he had the same No-Ip that is impossible as well. Every computer has its own IP same with No-Ip when you create one it will say if it is already in use. So the thing probably is that someone posted your server on moper scape server status.</p>
