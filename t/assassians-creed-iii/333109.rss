    <title>Assassians creed III?</title>

    <description>Only post ITT if you&#39;ve [i]beaten[/i] Assassians creed 2,

Here are my questions:


Did you like it?:
Do you think there will be a third?:
Favorite part:


Here&#39;s mine

-Spoiler if you haven&#39;t played it-
Did you like it?: Yeah, I thought it was great, a big improvement from AAI, because in the second one you actually build your character, and you have a lot of freedom.
Do you think there will be a third?: Yes, definitely. 
Favorite part (Can be assassinations or anything): I don&#39;t remember the guys name, but you fly out (using Leonardo&#39;s flying machine) onto this open court yard, and you have to quietly go over to the gorge and tell him that he&#39;s going to be assassinated by the guy in front of him (Slipped some kind of poison in his drink) too late though, the guy dies. The other guy runs away. So you have to chase the other guy and assassinate him, as soon as I do there&#39;s like 30 or so guards just running through the front gate, most of them are brutes. So I&#39;m shitting my pants thinking of something to do, and then I thought why not just come back the way I came. So I climbed up onto the roof, all of the archers are about to fire, and since this courtyard is surrounded by water, I make the perfect escape and dive into the water, as soon as I hit it, I see over a dozen arrows just fly into the water behind me. Shit was awesome, the escape was the best though.

yeah, discuss.</description>

              <p>I loved, haven’t completely finished. But I nearly have. Altairs is still for the win. ACF is the one who knows all about Assassins Creed, ask him if theres going to be a number three.</p>
