    <title>What would you like to do?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-would-you-like-to-do/431327</link>
    <description>When I&#39;ve left school I&#39;m not really sure what I want to do, and lately I&#39;ve been thinking about it A LOT for some reason. I want to go into the R.A.A.F, graphic game designer, act (just because i love being the person to put on a voice and act serious and all that stuff) or become an artist.

I&#39;ve not really decided and by the looks of it my best option is the R.A.A.F, but it&#39;s just a thought I&#39;ve been having. What would you like to do (if you have options) when you&#39;re out of school?

I&#39;m not sure if this topic has been made before. :)</description>

Also, use this on your resumé: “Alchemy level in skyrim: 100. Herblore level in rs: 99.”<br>
But in all seriousness I have been looking into that for awhile. When it comes to the human body, there are some things I can and can’t stand. Blood and organs I’ve gained an immunity to, but anything like excessive zit/pimple popping (see Tosh.0) I just can’t stand. Pharmaceutical work is best though because you’re not directly dealing with any of that. The creation of drugs has always interest me, and since a young age I’ve always admired those who are looked up to today for their major breakthroughs in science.</p>

              <p>When I’ve left school I’m not really sure what I want to do, and lately I’ve been thinking about it A LOT for some reason. I want to go into the R.A.A.F, graphic game designer, act (just because i love being the person to put on a voice and act serious and all that stuff) or become an artist.</p>
<p>I’ve not really decided and by the looks of it my best option is the R.A.A.F, but it’s just a thought I’ve been having. What would you like to do (if you have options) when you’re out of school?</p>
<p>I’m not sure if this topic has been made before. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
