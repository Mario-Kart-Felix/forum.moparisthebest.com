<p>Kind of. Both sexes can be as bad as each other so i am trying to make more general points.<br>

<p>Your generalization is just as sexist as the guys on here who are calling the crazy girl in the video a whore. There are plenty of guys who don’t fuck before they know everything is A-OK in the emotional department.  There is a difference between being a victim and seeking validation within your self-pity and shitty worldview.</p>
<p>Her parents should be more involved, she probably had some traumatic shit happen to her, she doesn’t know better, there is as you say much more going on, yet none of that is a valid excuse.</p>

        <p>if she wants to have baby there is no one to stop her, admittedly under certain circumstances people shouldnt be allowed to have children as they are clearly incapably of looking after themself let alone another. In this instance it seems unfair to judge, if someone wants to ahve sex with x amount of men/women there isn’t a necessity to call them a whore. Some people have an addiction to sex, a sympton i’ve been trying to convince people that i have but to no avail :). Yes girls have it easier in a pub / club as a girl doesnt need to impress to get laid, unless of course there are more women than men in which case its likely that if she wanted to get sex she would need to stand out. A guy will nearly always take sex without a second thought its just the way we are, its like with other animals where the male mates with a bunch of females to spread his seed far and wide. If a guy wants to get laid he has got to impress, he has got to stand out from the crowd its alot harder as women have certain aesthetic aspects that define how much a man wants them with a man its a lot different. Yeah sure girls like 6-packs and all that shit but they arent the sexual organs whereas 6-packs aren’t. A girl can’t always oggle at a guys cock because its more often than not hidden whereas boobs are clearly on display and girls take delight in torturing guys with them. So regardless of what you may think you have no right to judge until you have met her and genuinely talked to her and found out reasons and facts. Until you have all the evidence you have little or no right to judge.</p>

<p>That’s a really negative stereotype of men, and it’s wrong. I’m not judging this girl, I’m just saying she is responsible for herself and her body. She is making the choice to do what she will. I’m not saying those choices are right or wrong, I’m not judging her. In my opinion they are shitty choices, with real negative consequences.</p>

You sit there and call her a whore/slut but for someone to want to do that there’s a lot more going on then that video clip perceives.  I don’t think anyone here has the right to judge her, especially since most of you are male.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>[quote=“Taois”]but its a known fact guys think about sex more then girls anyway.<br>
So yea, guys i feel do put themselves out a lot more. [/quote]</p>
<p>Your generalization is just as sexist as the guys on here who are calling the crazy girl in the video a whore. There are plenty of guys who don’t fuck before they know everything is A-OK in the emotional department.  There is a difference between being a victim and seeking validation within your self-pity and shitty worldview.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah i agree, it’s hard to generalize especially because people cant be put into the ‘female’ or ‘male’ category because everyone is also different. I was not saying that ALL guys are like that because they are not, certainly if they were, i would be a lesibian now lol.<br>
Sex is also a mutual agreement as is using protection. But i do think she is being taken advantage of. Which is her fault, her parents fault, and also the fault of those she has sex with. I also think its down to the parents to get it sorted but it seems her mother is trying now.</p>
<blockquote>Her parents should be more involved, she probably had some traumatic shit happen to her, she doesn't know better, there is as you say much more going on, yet none of that is a valid excuse.</blockquote>
<p>Yea i agree. I wasn’t trying to stand for her as such but i still don’t think people have the right to simply say ‘your a whore’ without understanding the reasons behind it…and i notice, her dad wasn’t on the show was he? As far as i know there was no mention of him?<br>
But all what she’s doing is DAM RIGHT SELFISH. Selfish to the child she could have and not considering her mother.</p>

There’s 5 pubs in the small area in which i live. All are &lt; 10mins walking distance of each other and they’ve all been the same.<br>
I don’t live in the best of area’s though and it generally has a high teenage pregnancy rate/drug abuse rate/kids with criminal records.</p>
<blockquote>Sorry, that's how the brain works ;). But still it's a good thing as well. It would be boring if both sexes completely ignores each other (besides normal friendship)
I'm having serious doubt if she really wants one. She would just say she uses the pill and do it unprotected. There's no need to publicize it.
Also many men do have to deal with the consequences. It's still yours you know :)</blockquote>
<p>I didn’t mean it is necessarily a bad thing and i’m not trying to lump the blame on guys! It depends on person but…<br>
If you have a drunken one night stand with a girl and she ends up pregnant…it is her who has to deal with it and i tell you(not from experience but from those i’ve seen have children aborted) the experience is not easy and they usually end up regretting it for the rest of their lives…some of course choose to keep it but its a struggle and a big responsibility if they end up raising the child by themselves.<br>
some guys of course take a lot of responsibility which is great, respect to you!</p>
<p>You also have to understand because i have grown up in a bad area, a lot of my views are based on how guys treat girls here… There is an<span class="bbcode-b"> extremely high teenage pregnency rate</span>, my best friend had an ASBO by the time she was 13…her criminal record is about two inches thick…basically you live here and go to a bad secondary school(which most children here have to go to because no where else will accept us because of the bad reputation)…well i’ve not met anyone yet whom got themselves anything better then a minimum wage job…<br>
But if you work your ass off, get into a good school and manage to endure comments from everyone that you are ‘stuck up’ because you didnt drop out of school at 14…you have a good shot.<br>
Guys take a hell of a lot of advantage over girls who have an argument with their parents and are kicked out of their homes for the night.<br>
IE.A girl i knew was basically over the golf course, had sex with three guys and some other stuff…she was 13 years old…the other’s were between 17-21…yes she put herself out there but in this case to me she was taken advantage of.</p>
<p>[quote=“jme, post:38, topic:259639”]I wish people would stop saying I don’t have a right to judge.<br>
Of course I have the right to judge her. I judge everyone. Anyways, in the words of Dick Masterson, <a href="http://www.menarebetterthanwomen.com/every-woman-is-a-cheating-whore" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"> Everyone woman is a cheating whore.</a>[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s human nature to judge but i still people should at least try to understand other facts/situations before simply making assumptions.</p>
<p>‘Everyone woman is a cheating whore.’…ok…<br>
Thats like saying ‘Every person is guilty until proven innocent’…a person has that mistrusting attitude then…good luck to them in life.</p>

        <blockquote>Of course I have the right to judge her. I judge everyone.</blockquote>
<p>You can judge a behavior, but to judge an entire person or in this case gender, is to willingly blind yourself. I have met enough <span class="bbcode-b">people</span> to know that you can’t judge anybody. We determine our personal likes and dislikes and make value judgments in this regard, without choosing to stereotype others based on our own perceptions, if we wish to be fair.</p>
