    <description>i lost the key for one of my games and i had to restore my computer got a virus anyways so i need a keygen and dont really understand how they work so could someone explain? or post a code and ill probably figure it out i really want to play this game but the key was in the manual for the game and i dont really hang onto manuals... also kinda always been currious about this anyways :/</description>

</aside>
<p>Use a Torrent Sharing Website and Download A Client such as : Bitcomet and Utorrent and just simply look for your game<br>
Or simply make your own, But I would not make my own, too much work for something illegal, why do that when its there for you?</p>

<p>ok first, find the game you want to write a keygen for and disassemble/debug it. locate the portion of the game code where serial key validation occurs, and write the keygen according the how the serial validation algorithm works.</p>
<p>ie. if it was a simple validation where the first letter had to be ‘a’, the second and third had to be an even two digit number and the third had to be any letter and the fourth had to be the alphabetical successor to the third.</p>
<p>a valid key in this context would be: <span class="bbcode-i">a26kl</span></p>
<p>a higher level representation of the validation code (yours will almost always be in assembly of some sort) could be something like the following pseudocode:</p>
<p><code>boolean validKey(string key) {
    if key[0] == 'a'
        if (stringToInt(key[1] + key[2]) % 2) == 0
            if key[4] == (key[3] + 1)
                return true;
    return false;
}</code></p>
<p>to write a keygen, you’d have to analyse the above description/code and write a function that generates a key that adheres to the exact specification of the keygen.</p>
<p><code>string generate() {
    string key = "a";
    key.append(toString(26));
    key.append("kl");
    return key;
}</code></p>
<p>this is an extremely basic keygen example, most modern serial key algorithms are a hell of a lot more complex than this example, but this highlights the basic idea of how one would accomplish this. you’ll also want to add random number and character generation into your keygen, so people can use more than one key (helpful if keys won’t work if previously used or there’s a blacklist).</p>
<p>revised:</p>
<p><code>string generate() {
    string key = "a";
    key.append(toString(randomInRange(10, 99, isEven)));
    char gen = randomLetter();
    key[3] = gen;
    key[4] = gen + 1;
    return key;
}</code></p>
<p>possible outputs of that could be</p>
<p><code>a42mn
a98jk
a10tu
...</code></p>
<p>now the fun part is learning assembly and disassembling your game for the super awesome hi-tech serial validation algorithm which you’re going to reverse!!</p>

<p>this is a better idea if a keygen already exists. if it doesn’t, well, see above.</p>
