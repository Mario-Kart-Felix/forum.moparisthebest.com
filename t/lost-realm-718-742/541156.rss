Lost-Realm really does need everyone we can get, I&#39;m not going to lie, but our server has around 10 players every day. We want to exceed that limit, and possibly get anywhere from 20-40. So please, consider joining the server and having a great time here at Lost-Realm 718/742. We welcome you all!!
Thanks guys, take care.
