    <title>Another new computer</title>

    <description>ITS A LAPTOP! the 5/5th computer of mine that&#39;s been brought purely from something to do with runescape.

i was playing aion, got bored of it, looked for a bot and found one (its pretty crap but it does the job if you don&#39;t wanna use your computer, since it pretty much just automates your aion hotkeys) so since i do tons of other things on my pc i had to figure out a way to get another pc.

i then got some cash from as a leaving present from my old rsc pserver i used to dev. i decided instead of another PC ill buy a high spec laptop (easy to move around to lans/friends houses) so i bough this:

http://www.harveynorman.com.au/m/toshiba-satellite-a500-042-laptop.html

[code]The Toshiba Satellite A500/042 Laptop features the Intel® Centrino® 2 Core™ Duo 2.0GHz processor, 4GB RAM, 400GB Hard Disk Drive, DVD Burner, 1GB graphics, TV Tuner, Bluetooth® , 16&quot; screen and the Windows Vista® Home Premium operating system.[/code]

wiped it and put win7 on it (win laptop, might as well have a win OS) and i am happy with it. runs Aion/CSS/L4D/Grid on max settings 60+ fps. 4650 is a damn nice card, id say about 25% slower than a 8800/9800gt, and with laptop&#39;s smaller resolutions its quite easy to max out 99% of games.

Never had a laptop before, its cool. i was making some food today in the kitchen and i decided to go grab my laptop, wireless internet + battery = youtube music &amp; irc on the kitchen bench
