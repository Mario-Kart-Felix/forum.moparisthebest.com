Allow me to introduce myself to the community. My name is Matt (AKA - Protocol)
Let me answer a few questions for you, so that you can understand who is running this server and why.

[b]First of all, why are you running this server?[/b]

Well, glad of you to ask that question. I ran a successful RSC Private server for a very long time. It grew like no other back in it&#39;s prime day. I battled out kids who wanted to take me down, SQL Inject me, DDoS me, hack me. You name it... I fought and won the war. I could have kept my server going but due to a family emergency for over 2 months I had to shut it down. My server stayed up for 2 years because I was a GOOD leader. I knew what my community wanted and I listened to them every chance I had. I didn&#39;t care about the money, I didn&#39;t care about the fame. I cared about making my player base happy, and that&#39;s what I did everyday.

[b]What are you plans for running this server?[/b]

My plans for Protocol is to make it completely successful... I don&#39;t want it to be #1, or #2... I just want it to be.. The best it can be.

[b]Is your server a PK or a skilling server?[/b]

Both. You do what you want. If you want to go make money by slaying and getting Whip, or D Boots and etc.. Then so be it. If you want to go into the wilderness quickly, then so be it. My XP rates for combat and skilling are just perfect! You can basically call it a &quot;Hybrid&quot; server. It&#39;s just &#39;Perfect&#39;. It&#39;s very easy to get rich on my server, you just thieve. Within no-time you get a TON of money, then that&#39;s where you can go and buy some supplies in the general store to get you started for PKing.

So there you have it, some important questions answered there for you.. Now before I do show pictures, I do want to mention one thing...

I know how to run a server, I know what the community wants, I listen to the community, I don&#39;t do things &#39;MY WAY&#39;. If the community wants something done and a vote is done on it, that&#39;s the way it goes. I don&#39;t give out tons of items for donations because that just ruins the whole game. I don&#39;t abuse my admin powers, I don&#39;t act like a immature 14 year old. I am 21 years old, I have experience in running servers. If you choose Protocol as a server to play, you are making the right choice. :)

[b]Now ... ABOUT PROTOCOL![/b]

Protocol is 317 ver.  I have been working on this for nearly 4 months. The thing I hate the most about other servers is that they add custom items and training areas... That&#39;s stupid it honestly is. I just want this server to be as good as it can be like I said, I want it to be just.. Perfect in peoples view. Where you can log in and skill, and get to 99 to achieve that awesome cape and emote.. Or go PK and obtain the glory you want in the wilderness. Oh, and the base is Shard/CS. But Like I said.. I&#39;ve done numerous of work on it for at least 4 months.
