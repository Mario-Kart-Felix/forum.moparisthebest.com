    <title>Possible to switch to 508 client from 474?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/possible-to-switch-to-508-client-from-474/519153</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been developing my server for a weekish now, and it popped into my head... Can I have users switch between graphic styles? How so? Would I have to use different caches? Clients? obviously. But can anyone go about explaining the method?

Any help is much appreciated.</description>
