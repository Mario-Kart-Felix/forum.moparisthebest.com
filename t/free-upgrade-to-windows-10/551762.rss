The (supposed) catch is that Windows 10 is going to have a free trial option for everyone, or a subscription rate instead of a flat rate. We’ll see, so far everything has indicated the free windows 10 upgrade to be completely legit, even if it ends up only being for one year.<br>
[/quote]<br>
unless it gives you the option to downgrade back down once the “free trial” is up, its a pretty big catch[/quote]</p>
<p>supposedly the catch is that it invalidates your flexible multi-install win7/8 keys to a fixed hardware win10 install, I’m not sure if you can downgrade or format from scratch</p>

Do you have a source for the forced updates? I heard that it’s like that currently because it’s in testing and they want everyone on the same build, but I haven’t seen where they said it was going to stay that way. As for candy crush, they had pre-installed games on other versions of windows as well, as long as you’re able to uninstall it easily I don’t think that’ll be the dealbreaker for me<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>That actually makes complete sense for the forced updating. I had not read that. Thank you for clarifying. Bloatware is an inconvenience at most, and the lesser the better. But correct me if I am wrong, Microsoft never defaulted mass-revenue games to their installs in other releases.[/quote]</p>
<p>pinball came with xp and some earlier versions and it was a retail game at the time, some shit came with vista also</p>

<p>[quote]More annoyingly, perhaps, Microsoft has also changed how updates will work with Windows 10. Although the Pro and Enterprise editions will both be able to defer updates, Windows 10 Home users will not have the option. Updates will instead be downloaded and installed automatically as soon as they’re available.[/quote]</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I will be completely surprised if when win10 releases people won’t be able to disable automatic updates, some people simply do not have the data bandwidth or caps for ms to force whatever shit they want down user’s throats</p>
<p>I’m really disappointed that 99% of ‘tech news’ type sites are just parroting what microsoft say and aren’t harassing microsoft for what is essentially forced adware or <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_update/infinte-loop-on-boot-after-update-update-kb2770917/f350dd03-9d22-4eb8-9c96-42a23d13b34f" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">potentially forcing computers to brick</a> with dodgy updates</p>
<p>but then again, given the whole win10 preview keylogger fiasco where a dozen sites tried to claim it was no big deal, I wouldn’t be surprised if no one makes a big fuss when microsoft do force updates to be able to show ads on the startbar or something</p>

<p>Do you have a source for the forced updates?

</aside>
<p>That actually makes complete sense for the forced updating. I had not read that. Thank you for clarifying. Bloatware is an inconvenience at most, and the lesser the better. But correct me if I am wrong, Microsoft never defaulted mass-revenue games to their installs in other releases.</p>
<p>I haven’t been following this close enough to really make a sound decision. I can’t even justify an opinion about Windows 8, as I use Windows 7 at both home and work, but I do know my way around Windows 8. Right now it’s just a stir of opinions and geek-brawling. I am sure that within a couple of weeks there will be much more information.</p>

<p>I’m open to experiment but I’d prefer if a quick option to revert back to 7 was available. I’ll likely sign up to have it download and then do more research closer to July. I am sure a lot of creditable websites will be all over this soon.</p>
