    <title>[PI] Can&#39;t buy from shops, how do I make a shop sell items?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-cant-buy-from-shops-how-do-i-make-a-shop-sell-items/374100</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve posted this problem before on both Mopar and Rune-Server and either no one knows, or no one is willing to help.

I really need some help and hopefully this time I can get an answer.

I&#39;ve added some custom shops and for some reason I can&#39;t buy items from them. The NPC is there, I&#39;m able to trade it and view what&#39;s inside of the shop, view how much it costs, though I can&#39;t buy the items, even if I have coins in my inventory. How do I fix this? Some people have said it has something to do with shopAssistant.java, something about I need to make it so the shop accepts currency or something, but I&#39;m not exactly sure HOW to do that. Please help me!</description>
