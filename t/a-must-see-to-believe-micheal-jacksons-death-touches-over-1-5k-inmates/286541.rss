    <title>A Must See To Believe: Micheal Jackson&#39;s Death Touches Over 1.5K Inmates</title>

    <description>Wow, I know I&#39;ve posted a video already, but this one is overall the best video ever on these forums to me. When I first saw this video I sort of thought it was a joke, but I had belief in me that went against my thoughts. Before watching this video though, I didn&#39;t actually believe it was possible for 1 person to change the world with something so plain, but now I do. Just watching this video you won&#39;t regret that anything is possible:

And some info to the people who think of this as a joke or w/e, this is real. MJ&#39;s death has touched many counties instantly within 1-2 days, people have actually killed themselves too!

PS: Billy May has died at age 50 too! (That who invented faster washing technology, yeah: check out his video: http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshhoo468K6e7EwR3yD1)</description>

<p>Actually, this one may be new. The same jail performed Thriller about 3 years ago, however ;D</p>
