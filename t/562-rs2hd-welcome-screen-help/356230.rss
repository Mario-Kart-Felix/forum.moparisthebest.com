    <title>562 rs2hd Welcome Screen Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-rs2hd-welcome-screen-help/356230</link>
    <description>I downloaded a rs2hd server and client a couple weeks ago and have been working on making them functional. However, I keep running into a problem in the server. Whenever someone logs in, the server is set up to show the &quot;Welcome to RuneScape&quot; welcome screen, which it does. The screen disappears, though, after a few seconds. My best guess is that a graphic update closes the welcome screen, but I still cannot find how to make sure the welcome screen stays open until the player decides to close it.

Any help would be much appreciated. Here is the code that actually opens the welcome screen (it&#39;s pretty bare but it does the job):

[code]           sendWindowPane(549, 0);
		sendInterface(1, 549, 2, 378);
		sendInterface(1, 549, 3, 16);
		sendString(&quot;Welcome to.&quot;, 378, 115);
		sendString(&quot;You are connected from: &quot; + player.getSession().getRemoteAddress(), 378, 116);
		sendString(&quot;0&quot;, 378, 39);
		sendString(&quot;0&quot;, 378, 96);
		sendString(&quot;0 unread messages&quot;, 378, 37);
		sendString(&quot;Owner is Boob Coder is Dj&quot;, 378, 38);
		sendString(&quot;Please register at boobscape.net&quot;, 378, 94);
		sendString(&quot;You have 0 days of member credit remaining. Please click here to extend your credit.&quot;, 378, 93);
		sendString(&quot;You do not have a bank pin. Please visit a bank if you would like one.&quot;, 378, 62);
		sendString(&quot;You have not yet set any recovery questions.&quot;, 378, 56);
		sendString(&quot;Message of the Week&quot;, 16, 0);
		sendString(&quot;Remember to keep your account secure: set a bank PIN, set recover questions and NEVER give away your password.&quot;, 16, 4);[/code]

**EDIT**: When the welcome screen closes, a teleport animation appears where the player is standing. Maybe the animation closes the welcome screen.</description>
