A new prescription drug proposition gained steam Thursday, picking up support coming from key Republicans who have determined that President Bush’s policy for providing prescription drugs to be able to seniors will be in a position to die a quiet loss of life, reports CBS Information Chief Washington Correspondent Bob Schieffer.Instead, they will push a bipartisan strategy that follows the approach taken through the campaign by  Gore  a plan that makes prescribed drugs available as a benefit of the Medicare right program.The strategy is part of a broad change of Medicare sponsored by two senators, Democrat John Breaux of Louisiana and also Republican Bill Frist of Tn, who believe you will find there’s growing consensus to make prescription drugs part of Treatment. "Prescription drugs should be section of Medicare. I don’t consider there’s a difference among any group or perhaps organization that feels that it should not,Inch Breaux said.The Congressional Finances Office estimates the particular Breaux-Frist plan for all elderly people would cost $163 billion over 10 years.The cornerstone of Gore’s advertising campaign was making prescription medication coverage a part of Medicare insurance, but Mr. Bush has opposed which approach as not affordable. Mr. Bush shells a limited plan that could provide coverage only to the poorest seniors. He wants to provide states a $12 billion a year lump transaction that they could distribute to seniors that needed help acquiring drugs.But now, Republican Sen. Charles Grassley regarding Iowa, the new chairman of the Senate Financing Committee who will play the key role inside shaping Medicare change, said Thursday he favors the Breaux-Frist approach to make drugs a part of Medicare, a see other key Republicans tend to be coming to share.Important Republican support makes the chances better than ever that prescription drug legislation will be passed this year.

Imagine waking up one morning hours and finding that the actual stop lights aren’t effective, the police dispatch is paralyzed, and your residence tax records have been lost. CBS Reports Correspondent Jeffrey Kofman reports about the possible outcome of 1999 computer bug."It can affect the hospitals, it’ll affect the businesses, it will affect the people who provide you with the city. It will affect everybody, " says Mayor Tom Suozzi, referring to the havoc the brand new millenium could wreak on life as part of his town – Glen Cove, N.B.The 25,500 residents of Glen Cove are usually scrambling to purge their own computers of the Year Two thousand computer bug. Even so, a recent survey found out that half of New York state town and neighborhoods haven’t even begun to work on the problem. Massive business and big authorities have been deploying a large amount of money and small armies of programmers to repair their computers. These are worried that they is not going to make it in time. Around the world, thousands of smaller authorities face a more simple problem."They simply do not have the money to hire the people to help them become up to date for the year 2000. What is happening at the state amount is that we have misplaced a lot of the professionals who can perform this because they happen to be enticed away by the private sector,In . says Carl McCall, New York Point out Comptroller.The problem is big therefore worrisome that Ny State set up a special satellite teleconference earlier this year so that local government officers could learn how to share resources. That could support Glen Cove, where the mayor has to find $100,000 in their budget to alter the city’s pcs and desktops. “But we’ve not figured out how to deal with imbedded chips, the little chips throughout trucks and turbines and communications methods and beepers,” Suozzi affirms.Figuring out how to resolve all those things is going to take time – and that useful resource is running low for Glen Cove and a large number of other communities, since the millenium approaches.
