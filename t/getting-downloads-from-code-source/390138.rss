    <title>Getting downloads from code source?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-downloads-from-code-source/390138</link>
    <description>I was recently looking at this video for a online 15th prestige hack for black ops and he gives you the website link and on the website has the link to the 3 files you need and to get them, but you have to complete surveys witch probably never end or they probably keep saying ok 1 more survey so is there a way to get the direct download link from either the website code source ore the survey code source?

I am guessing that its probably fake and hes just getting money off of every survey completed and the downloads will never appear but if they are is there a shortcut or something to them?


Or does anybody here host 15th lobbies?</description>
