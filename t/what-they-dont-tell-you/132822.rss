Vegetarians don’t get everything they need when they eat, so they take vitamins. The vitamins they take don’t supply what the actual thing could give, it helps but they aren’t as healthy. Just because they’re eating healthy food, doesn’t mean they’re healthy.<br>

<p>That’s actually bullshit, commonly spouted by “anti-vegetarians”. Vegetable protein provides everything “meat” protein does, except for certain amino acids which are present in other foods. If you know your diet, and combine foods containing the essential acids with vegetables in the same meal, you are eating just as healthily as a meat-eating person is.</p>
<p>Also, there is biological evidence that humans are not designed to be omnivores at all, but herbivores. Of course, there is also evidence to the contrary (our teeth, mainly) but did you know that many cancers of our internals (bowels/intestines etc.) would be a lot less common/would not exist did we not eat meat.</p>
<p>I am not a vegetarian, by the way, I love my meat - it does piss me off when people with no biological knowledge spout this “omg vegetarianz are teh unhealthy!!!oneone” bullshit, however. Especially when they almost certainly have a shitty diet themselves.[/quote]</p>

              <p>Stay away from PeTA. They are just a bunch of crazy vegetarians. I love eating meat, even though it may come from slaughter houses like those that we all saw in that link. PeTA calls it cruel, and I’m not denying that some of it is, but face the facts. We need meat to survive. The point where PeTA says eating meat makes you fat is totally false. Becuase of the STEAK I EAT, I’ve gained about 10 pounds of lean muscle mass over the past 5 weeks. But, I do agree that some of the techniques used to harvest animals are inhumane, especially where they slit a cow’s throat and let it bleed to death. My main point is: IF YOU HAVE TO HARVEST ANIMALS FOR THEIR MEAT, AT LEAST USE SOME SORT OF DRUG THAT WILL KILL THEM OR MAKE THEM UNCONSIOUS SO THAT THEY DO NOT FEEL ANY PAIN.</p>
<p>Anyone have a response…?</p>

              <p>I have to agree with jme. Peta is a bunch of fucked up cooks, that fuck animals. The best thing you can do is never think of opening that web page again, I watched the videos, looked at the pictures, and read the snip its, but the fact is, most of those videos are 9 or 10 years old. Besides, I found conflicting information throughout the site.</p>
