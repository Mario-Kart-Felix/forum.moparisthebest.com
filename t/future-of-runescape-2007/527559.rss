    <title>Future of Runescape 2007</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/future-of-runescape-2007/527559</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been thinking about it and playing runescape 2007 can feel like playing a private server. You know all the tips and tricks and nothing really excites you except for that occasion crazy stake/kill. 

As long as staking, pking, graphics, and game-changing weapons are left alone I think more updates for 07 would be good.

A few examples would be adding a lot more new unique quests that aren&#39;t necessarily tied to EOC. They don&#39;t affect you, you can do them if you want, or you can ignore them and pretend they don&#39;t exist.

New bosses/PvM are also really important, but Jagex has to be really careful not to create inflation by giving gold drops like old pvp world statues, or

weapons like Dclaws that ruin PvP

New minigames would also be fun, perhaps a PvP type minigame where you can collect drops+get additional points to spend on other crap


tl;dr:

Jagex needs to keep updating the game, constantly adding new content that is [i]optional [/i]</description>

No. OSRS came out in February.<br>
