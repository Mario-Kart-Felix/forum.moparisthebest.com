              <p>You would probaly have to have 2 diff server running and 2 diffrent ports. I probally could host it on hamachi for you cause i host my friends also.But steps below on how to host your self.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 1:</span> Go to <a href="http://www.hamachi.cc" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.hamachi.cc</a> and download the free version of hamachi. (you don’t have to register , you can skip it)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 2:</span> Once you have hamachi installed and crap , Push the button on the far left and then it will turn hamachi on…</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 3:</span> Now you will need to make your network for people to join in order to get on your server. Click the button that looks like a triangle and then click create a new network. Put the name and password you want for your server.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 4:</span> Now for people to join your server you must first run your server so that black box is up. And also the people that want to get on your server will have to know you hamachi network name and password. (the one you created in the last step). So once your people are in the server those people will need to follow the steps below.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 5:</span> For those that want to join your server… They have to take the IP that is beside your name on <span class="bbcode-b">Hamachi</span> and go to moparscape and go to file&gt;New server and put that IP there.Then they will have to go to file&gt;new port and put your server port there , unless you did’nt change that.</p>
<p>There you go and if you want to me to host it for you just PM me or contact me though one of these.</p>
