    <description>hey guys, I&#39;ve recently downloaded a source and I started changing things, but I wanted to know how I&#39;d do this. There&#39;s an achievement in the game for logging in for the first time, and it gives you 99 for every skilling stat. I was wondering how can I like , not make that happen?</description>
