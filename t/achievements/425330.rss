    <description>I was on my friends server but I don&#39;t want to ask him how he did it if its easy but on his server he had achievements like the ones i uploaded and I was wanting to know if someone had a tutorial on how to add them or a client/server I could rip them from.
I prefer the second one cause I want to learn how to add them more then just do a tutorial and not really learn anything other then copy and paste. :P</description>

Say if you get a certain amount of kills like 50 it lights up green when you have completed it and then under it it’ll be like 100 kills etc.</p>
