    <title>Korasi special attack not working</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/korasi-special-attack-not-working/396769</link>
    <description>Ok so ive managed to successfully add the a korasi to my game but cannot get the special attack working. 
None of the tutorials seem to cover the way which my source has been coded in order to implement it. so i&#39;ve just been tweaking the code for hours on end trying to get it to work. 

*I don&#39;t have Special.java*
But i do have combatassistant.java  

just to try to test it i have copied the code from a dlong and applied that to the korasi. 

The spawn code is 18786.


[b]Here is the code in the combatassistant.java this doesn&#39;t work[/b] (not sure why)
[code]   case 18786:
		c.gfx100(248);
		c.startAnimation(1058);
		c.hitDelay = getHitDelay(c.getItems().getItemName(c.playerEquipment[c.playerWeapon]).toLowerCase());
	        c.specAccuracy = 1.10;
		c.specDamage = 1.20;
	     break;                                
  [/code]	

In order to add the korasi i added the basic code to Item.cfg and the model into the models folder.

also i had to use ItemDef.java to assign the model to the spawn code and what ever else this code does ive just been applying what was already there to my korasi code. 
[code]case 18786:
                itemDef.modelid = 8002;
                itemDef.name = &quot;Korasi&#39;s sword&quot;;
                itemDef.modelZoom = 1513;
                itemDef.modelRotationY = 525;
                itemDef.modelRotationX = 40;
                itemDef.modelOffset1 = 4;
                itemDef.modelOffset2 = -3;
                itemDef.groundActions = new String[5];
                itemDef.itemActions[1] = &quot;Wear&quot;;
                itemDef.itemActions[4] = &quot;Drop&quot;;
        break;     
	[/code]


I have no idea what&#39;s going on after adding the special attack the weapon is just a normal sword with no special. Im sure im missing something out no idea what. any help would be appreciated.</description>
