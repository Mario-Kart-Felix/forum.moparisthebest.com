    <title>Opinions on a resizable client with image scaling?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/opinions-on-a-resizable-client-with-image-scaling/550508</link>
    <description>Pros:
it would bring in more players as the client was made for 800x600 resolution monitors. higher resolution monitors are making the screen smaller and smaller.

cons:
any cons are worth the pro</description>

              <p>RSCA client supports resizing, so its been done. As for resizing the graphics themselves… not worth the effort. Also if were going to get into mobile talk, you shouldn’t even bother to port this game. Instead, create an automation system via app to control your character in the gameserver (like a bot, but from your phone and you have to enter in key words every x minutes) hell, you could even sell the app for $5… so in a way you could control and make money off the bots on your server.</p>

              <p>Looks great on the galaxy note. RSC is a waste of time on the PC just to resize it. Plus that looks like poo.</p>
<p>More work needs done mobile side if anything.</p>
