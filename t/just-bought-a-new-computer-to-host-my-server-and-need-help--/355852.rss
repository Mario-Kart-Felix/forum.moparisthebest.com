    <title>Just bought a new computer to host my server and need help -_-</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/just-bought-a-new-computer-to-host-my-server-and-need-help--/355852</link>
    <description>Hello, I hosted my server on my other computer but noticed the computer was getting way to slow for me to continue, so I went out and bought an ultra expensive gaming pc, I got back, hooked everything up, took the files and transfered them &quot;via&quot; a brand new flash drive I bought whilst at the store, then I converted the files from the drive to my new computer, I downloaded Java 6 u 21 and set my path and CLASSPATH  6 u 21, I downloaded the No-ip DUC and cranked er on, runs fine, I went to light my server up and it says: &#39;Java&#39; is not recognised as an internal or external command or operable batch file.  The new system is 64.bit, running windows 7.  Please help me, I need help fast.  Thank you!</description>
