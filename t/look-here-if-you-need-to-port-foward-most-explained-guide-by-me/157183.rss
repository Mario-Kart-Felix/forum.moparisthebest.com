[b]Private Server Facts:[/b]

[i]&gt;&gt; They all crash, this means, they will crash while they are running, and they will require a restart, this cannot be helped[/i]

[i]&gt;&gt; They don&#39;t have the most current runescape graphics, they won&#39;t ever be so good[/i]

[i]&gt;&gt; None of them are complete, some magic doesnt work, and most sources are different, it takes years to get it perfect[/i]

[i]&gt;&gt; All sources are based off a few beginning servers, and have been upgraded upon and released [/i] 

_______________________________________________________________________________________________
[b][u]The Mini Download Section[/u][/b]  :|          [b]Downloads updated daily[/b]

_______________________________________________________________________________________________
[b]Download this server source if you are really stuck:[/b]

[b]How to get your server source to a suitable standard[/b]

[u]Step One[/u], [i]Opening your source files.[/i]

[i]When you have opened your source, their will be many files, I will help you get your Compiler and Run-Server working, because you may be getting problems.[/i]

First of all, look for this file:

[IMG]http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/compileertut.jpg[/img]

[u]Step Two[/u], [i]Editing your compiler.[/i]

When you have found that file, Right click on it, and select &quot;edit&quot; as shown:

[IMG]http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/cppilereror2.jpg[/img]

Then a Notepad will come up, replace [b]EVERYTHING[/b] in their with this:

[url=http://uppit.com/d/DKANB]Download Compiler[/url]

[u]Step Three[/u], [i]Checking compiler.[/i]

[i]Then select compile, when it has finished compiling, if it a working, it will look something like this:[/i]

[IMG]http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/happycompiler.jpg[/img]

[u]Step Four[/u], [i]Running your server.[/i]

[i]Now, hit space, and then R+enter, that will run your server, a happy run will look something like this:[/i]

[IMG]http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/Happyrunner.jpg[/img]

[i]It won&#39;t say pkmadscape though, that is just the name of my server, but your could say something like &quot;testerscape&quot;, but it doesn&#39;t really matter.[/i]

[i]If you get an error, saying you need Java JDK, this is where to download from:[/i]

[url=http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp]Download Java Development Kit[/url]

[i]Download version 6.0, as shown below:[/i]

[IMG]http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/javajdk.jpg[/img]

[b]Hope this small tutorial helped you, read on, to find out how to portfoward[/b]
_______________________________________________________________________________________________
[b]How PortFowarding Works:[/b] 

[i]PortFowarding allow&#39;s other people on to your server, to allow this you must PortFoward to allow Guests to enter you Router Gateway, this is safe however but as shown you must not give any IP&#39;s away, if you would somehow prefer not to PortFoward, their is a alternative route to this, you can simply use Hamachi, but it could become to complicated, this tutorial explains both ways to PortFoward, using the PortFoward method or the Hamachi method.[/i]

[b]No-Ip:[/b] 

[i]If you chose to use the PortFoward method, you could possibly get a no-ip, this is near the end of the tutorial. This is how it works[/i]:

[i]If your IP was 124.675.346.1:[/i]

[/list][/ul]
[code]124.675.346.1[/code]

[i]to make it easier for guests to remember, is could be something like tester.no-ip.org:[/i]

[code]tester.no-ip.org[/code]

[i]then you can change the IP via the website of no-ip[/i] 

Welcome To Your Perfect PortFoward Guide, Which Now Has An Hamachi Tutorial

[b]Procedure:[/b][i] Copy And Maybe Paste ;D[/i]

[b]Difficulty:[/b] [i]1.5/10 Which Is Easy  :P[/i]

[b]Reason:[/b] [i]To Make Your Server Run For Other Guests To Come On  ;)[/i]

[u]To Find The Hamachi Tutorial Scroll Down To Bottom[/u]

[b]Part 1, Setting Up A No-Ip Server (PortFoward Needed)[/b]
_______________________________________________________________________________________________
[i]First you need to find your internet IP, you need to click on start, then internet connections, or just use run. Here is a picture:[/i]

[IMG]http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/Part1oftutgoingtoallconnections.jpg[/img]

[i]Then click on &quot;Show all connections&quot;  Write that IP down on a piece of paper, because that will come in handy later on.[/i]

[i]When you have clicked on internet connections, you need to click once on your main network, here is a example:[/i]

[IMG]http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/part2findingip.jpg[/img]

[i]It is very important to remember that IP, or your portfoward won&#39;t work![/i]

[i]Now in the address bar type &quot;192.168.1.1&quot; or &quot;192.168.1.2&quot; if none of those work, go to &quot;start&quot; then on the option &quot;run&quot; as shown below:

[IMG]http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/tutaddedprst1.jpg[/img]

Then in the run box type &quot;cmd&quot; in it, like this:

[IMG]http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/prt2.jpg[/img]

Then a black box will come up, it will look something like this:

[IMG]http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/prt3.jpg[/img]

Now in that box, type &quot;ipconfig&quot; as shown then you will get this:

[IMG]http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/prt4.jpg[/img]

Use the bottom IP first, then if that doesn&#39;t work, use the top one as shown, for my example I would use &quot;192.168.1.1&quot; first, then if that did not work I would use &quot;192.168.1.64&quot;. If none of those work, use this link, and use that IP:

[b][url=http://www.ipchicken.com]www.ipchicken.com[/url][/b]

When you are on that, copy that IP to your address bar.

Then a security bar will come up, it will look like this:[/i]

[IMG]http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/part3typeadminadmin.jpg[/img]

[i]If your mum/dad hasn&#39;t changed it, the user will be &quot;admin&quot; and the password will be &quot;admin&quot;. If you notice that it is not working, this means the password has been changed, if it is changed your stuffed![/i]

[i]If you do have success, this screen should come up, this example is of a linksey&#39;s router settings, but the are near enough the same:[/i]

[IMG]http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/part4goingtogameandappc.jpg[/img]

[i]Now you need to go on to [i]applications and gaming[/i], and copy this example:[/i]

[IMG]http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/part5portyforard.jpg[/img]

[i]The 43594 part is the port you want, to start I would use that port, also the name I used Http and Ftp you can all it anything you want, the &quot;192.168.1.64&quot; was the IP that is on your internet connections box, so just change to whatever IP you had[/i]

[i]An optional way is to use the other portfoward way, this is like this:[/i]

[IMG]http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/part6otherport.jpg[/img]
_______________________________________________________________________________________________
[i]Then save up and you should be done, Hope I helped you! Also if you want a no-ip, use [url=http://www.no-ip.com]www.no-ip.com[/url]

You should get this screen:[/i]

[IMG]http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/part7no-ip.jpg[/img]

[i]Once you have created a name, you will have a display like this, with all your current no-ip&#39;s it will look something like this:[/i]

[IMG]http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/part9no-ip.comips.jpg[/img]

[i]To create a host, use the blue host button at bottom of list, after you click on it you add it as shown:[/i]

[IMG]http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/part10no-ip.jpg[/img]

[i]Well folks, if you need hamachi, this is the tutorial for you![/i]

[b]Part 2, Making A Hamachi Server (No PortFoward Needed)[/b]_______________________________________________________________________________________________
[i]Ok first, we need to download Hamachi, you can download it here:[/i]

[url=http://www.hamachi.cc/download/list.php]http://www.hamachi.cc/download/list.php[/url] Warning: DOWNLOAD HAMACHI AT YOUR OWN RISK
[i]When you are on that, you will need to download version 1.0.2.1 like this:[/i]

[IMG]http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/HAMATCHIPRT1.jpg[/img]

[i]When you have downloaded it, you will need to open it on your computer, when you have done all that, you will get a box, you will need to turn it on, like this example:[/i]

[IMG]http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/part1000000000.jpg[/img]

[i]Now when you have turned it on, you will get an IP at the top like the picture above, that is now your Hamachi IP[/i]

[i]Now to create your own server, you will need to copy this:[/i]

[IMG]http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/24-bitlmao.jpg[/img]

[i]Then when you have that, Create a username for your server and password, it is recommended that you make more than one name ETC: tester and tester1 so you don&#39;t get one name all full:[/i]

[IMG]http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/jamesisgayyyyyyyyy.jpg[/img]

[i]Then:[/i]

[IMG]http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/yourmum.jpg[/img]

[i]Then your Hamachi should be set up. [/i]

<p><span class="bbcode-i">When you have opened your source, their will be many files, I will help you get your Compiler and Run-Server working, because you may be getting problems.</span></p>
<p>First of all, look for this file:</p>
<p><img src="http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/compileertut.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Step Two</span>, <span class="bbcode-i">Editing your compiler.</span></p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Hope this small tutorial helped you, read on, to find out how to portfoward</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">How PortFowarding Works:</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">PortFowarding allow’s other people on to your server, to allow this you must PortFoward to allow Guests to enter you Router Gateway, this is safe however but as shown you must not give any IP’s away, if you would somehow prefer not to PortFoward, their is a alternative route to this, you can simply use Hamachi, but it could become to complicated, this tutorial explains both ways to PortFoward, using the PortFoward method or the Hamachi method.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">No-Ip:</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">If you chose to use the PortFoward method, you could possibly get a no-ip, this is near the end of the tutorial. This is how it works</span>:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">If your IP was 124.675.346.1:</span></p>
<p>[/list][/ul]</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">124.675.346.1</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">to make it easier for guests to remember, is could be something like <a href="http://tester.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">tester.no-ip.org</a>:</span></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">tester.no-ip.org</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">then you can change the IP via the website of no-ip</span></p>
<p>Welcome To Your Perfect PortFoward Guide, Which Now Has An Hamachi Tutorial</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Procedure:</span><span class="bbcode-i"> Copy And Maybe Paste ;D</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Difficulty:</span> <span class="bbcode-i">1.5/10 Which Is Easy  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Reason:</span> <span class="bbcode-i">To Make Your Server Run For Other Guests To Come On  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">To Find The Hamachi Tutorial Scroll Down To Bottom</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Part 1, Setting Up A No-Ip Server (PortFoward Needed)</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">First you need to find your internet IP, you need to click on start, then internet connections, or just use run. Here is a picture:</span></p>
<p><img src="http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/Part1oftutgoingtoallconnections.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Then click on “Show all connections”  Write that IP down on a piece of paper, because that will come in handy later on.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">When you have clicked on internet connections, you need to click once on your main network, here is a example:</span></p>
<p><img src="http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/part2findingip.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">It is very important to remember that IP, or your portfoward won’t work!</span></p>
<p>[i]Now in the address bar type “192.168.1.1” or “192.168.1.2” if none of those work, go to “start” then on the option “run” as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/tutaddedprst1.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Then in the run box type “cmd” in it, like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/prt2.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Then a black box will come up, it will look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/prt3.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Now in that box, type “ipconfig” as shown then you will get this:</p>
<p><img src="http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/prt4.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Use the bottom IP first, then if that doesn’t work, use the top one as shown, for my example I would use “192.168.1.1” first, then if that did not work I would use “192.168.1.64”. If none of those work, use this link, and use that IP:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><a href="http://www.ipchicken.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">www.ipchicken.com</a></span></p>
<p>When you are on that, copy that IP to your address bar.</p>
<p>Then a security bar will come up, it will look like this:[/i]</p>
<p><img src="http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/part3typeadminadmin.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">If your mum/dad hasn’t changed it, the user will be “admin” and the password will be “admin”. If you notice that it is not working, this means the password has been changed, if it is changed your stuffed!</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">If you do have success, this screen should come up, this example is of a linksey’s router settings, but the are near enough the same:</span></p>
<p><img src="http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/part4goingtogameandappc.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Now you need to go on to <span class="bbcode-i">applications and gaming</span>, and copy this example:</span></p>
<p><img src="http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/part5portyforard.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">The 43594 part is the port you want, to start I would use that port, also the name I used Http and Ftp you can all it anything you want, the “192.168.1.64” was the IP that is on your internet connections box, so just change to whatever IP you had</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">An optional way is to use the other portfoward way, this is like this:</span></p>
<p><img src="http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/part6otherport.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<hr>
<p>[i]Then save up and you should be done, Hope I helped you! Also if you want a no-ip, use <a href="http://www.no-ip.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">www.no-ip.com</a></p>
<p>You should get this screen:[/i]</p>
<p><img src="http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/part7no-ip.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Once you have created a name, you will have a display like this, with all your current no-ip’s it will look something like this:</span></p>
<p><img src="http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/part9no-ip.comips.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">To create a host, use the blue host button at bottom of list, after you click on it you add it as shown:</span></p>
<p><img src="http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/part10no-ip.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Your perfect Hamachi Guide!</span> Warning: DOWNLOAD HAMACHI AT YOUR OWN RISK</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Well folks, if you need hamachi, this is the tutorial for you!</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Part 2, Making A Hamachi Server (No PortFoward Needed)</span>_______________________________________________________________________________________________<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Ok first, we need to download Hamachi, you can download it here:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.hamachi.cc/download/list.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.hamachi.cc/download/list.php</a> Warning: DOWNLOAD HAMACHI AT YOUR OWN RISK<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">When you are on that, you will need to download version 1.0.2.1 like this:</span></p>
<p><img src="http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/HAMATCHIPRT1.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">When you have downloaded it, you will need to open it on your computer, when you have done all that, you will get a box, you will need to turn it on, like this example:</span></p>
<p><img src="http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/part1000000000.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Now when you have turned it on, you will get an IP at the top like the picture above, that is now your Hamachi IP</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Now to create your own server, you will need to copy this:</span></p>
<p><img src="http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/24-bitlmao.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Then when you have that, Create a username for your server and password, it is recommended that you make more than one name ETC: tester and tester1 so you don’t get one name all full:</span></p>
<p><img src="http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/jamesisgayyyyyyyyy.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Then:</span></p>
<p><img src="http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/yourmum.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Then your Hamachi should be set up. </span></p>
<p><img src="http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z82/musicmad441/mathanks.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
