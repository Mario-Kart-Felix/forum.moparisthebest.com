    <title>Opiate withdrawl?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/opiate-withdrawl/544362</link>
    <description>We&#39;ll let me start off by saying this, SWIM have been prescribed oxycodone 30mg tablets (120/mo) since  SWIM was 15 yrs old.. And is now about to be 21. Never in SWIMs life had SWIM experienced any kind of withdrawl besides a lil depression.. SWIM has been in many car accidents (thrown out a windshield, crushed by a truck, spine broke by jetski etc) SWIM use to smoke lots and lots of pot and figures this is why he never felt cramps, cold sweats, diarrhea etc. swim has detoxed many times without a problem.. Just as a frequent pot smoker.. Went about a yr without them and went back to doc because of frequent pains and only wanted 10mg 120/mo.. Went 6 months fine, now trying to stop and it&#39;s fucking hell.. I&#39;m on the toilet at work typing this drinking Imodium like crazy.. Can&#39;t smoke pot because SWIM took cops on high speed chase.. SWIM has a really good job now and a 5 month old child lives on his own and is the only one working to support family.. Want to know if anyone has been through this and how they beat it, I have a little over two weeks until I report but my job drug tests occasionally.. Thanks in advance guys</description>
