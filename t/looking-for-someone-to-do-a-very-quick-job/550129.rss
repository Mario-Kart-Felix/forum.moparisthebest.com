              <p><code>            if (playerCommand.equals("home") &amp;&amp; (c.playerRights &gt;= 0)) {
			c.getPA().startTeleport(####, ####, #, "modern");
			c.sendMessage("THE MESSAGE YOU WISH TO PUT HERE");
		}</code></p>
<p>This is a very basic code, that you can use for any of your " teleport " commands for ::train , ::home , ::skilling , and so on</p>
<p>in the first #### would go your x coord, and the next #### would be your " y "</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>The last " # " would be height ( most of the time it is 0â€¦ &lt; ) if you have any questions please ask, this is easier than having someone else do it!</p>
