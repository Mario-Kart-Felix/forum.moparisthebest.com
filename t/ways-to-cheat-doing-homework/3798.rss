    <description>Instead of cheating in school, how do you guys get out of not doing your homework? I personally don&#39;t even have anything up my sleeve, I&#39;m only in grade 8 and I just tell the teacher I didn&#39;t finish it =p.</description>

If you don’t do it you get a Homework detention sticker. (You stay in the lunch time)<br>
If you get 2 of those you get a SAS Suspention after school. You have to pickup rubbish around the school for 30mins. Get 3 of those and you get a detention! (Stay 2 hours after school) Get 2 of those! And You get a in-school Suspension! Get like 3 of those and your suspended for a week! And so on…I don’t want to type more.</p>

              <p>Alright I’m going into 9th in 7 days… My school is evil.<br>
But anyways, I generally help people figure the homework out myself, I don’t give them the answers, but I make the problems a heck of a lot simpler.  As I see it, it’s easy to just go ahead and help people out, but for myself, I just do all of my homework in Study Hall, or in the middle of other classes.  I get alot of sleep at school  :D.</p>

              <p>If your math teacher goes around checking if you did it or not instead of collecting it, show the teacher your work from last week or something, and just use that for the whole year. OR - if one person did the homework that night have him/her give that homework to you and show the teacher that you did your homework.</p>

              <p>i just don’t turn it in, and then tell the teacher i did turn it in several days later when i have a 0 in the gradebook. then the teacher will do 1 of 3 things.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make you do the assignment again.</li>
<li>Give u an average grade for it</li>
<li>Give u a 0<br>
They very rarely do 3 though.</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s also a much easier way, take another persons homework, scribble out their name, and put yours. Then they have to deal with the above^^</p>
