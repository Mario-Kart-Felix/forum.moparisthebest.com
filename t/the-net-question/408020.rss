    <title>&quot;the .net&quot; question?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-net-question/408020</link>
    <description>can u program a class in say c#.net and use it in a vb.net app? or say a asp.net c# class and use it in a windows desktop c# app?

because my teacher says thats how .net works yet i cant get it to work... he wants us to create a simple c# facebook messaging desktop app. so i find 2 c# facebook sdks. the official one and one from codeplex. i think it is for developing server-side code wrote in c#.

ive been looking at how to make a facebook app and stuff; my teacher i believe hasnt even took a glance at it.

tl;dr - is the facebook c# sdk for desktop or web development?
and can .net classes of different .net languages be used interchangeably in different languages, such as c# in a vb project?(im talking about taking a .dll created in c# and using it in a vb project, b/c i cant get it to work)

thx

edit:
if u rename a thread does that remove any posts? i wouldnt think it would but b4 i read my thread it said someone commented then after i changed the name there was no replies, i just assume they deleted their post.</description>

              <p>i fixed it. it was extremely simple but i shouldnt have had to fix it, it should have been in working order when facebook released the example <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> the problem was the namespace of the sdk was Facebook, but they had in the example referencing FacebookAPI.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
ok referencing c# classes from a C# project is easy but now i cant reference the dll in my vb project… i would just do it all in c# but no my teacher wants us to use the languages interchangeably… its should be extremely simple, y isnt it u add the dll to ur project, add it as a reference, and use the import keyword for the namespace of the dll classes,? but no obviously it isnt that simple… he wants use to make a c# wrapper class then reference that class. i dont understand why that will work any different than just using the dll. i have made 2 projects in the same solution one vb the other c#, i added the c# source code thinking i could reference it like that… no i can i never had any problems working with java <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> i cant wait till we get to our java course.</p>
<p>edit2:<br>
got it all working now. the c# target was .net 4.0, and the vb form i was making was set to .net 4.0 client profile. so i just set the target to .net 4.0 and it all works now.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I don’t currently know much about the .net framework, I found an article on wikipedia providing information about dynamic linking libraries, which you can find here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-link_library#Microsoft_Visual_Basic" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-link_library#Microsoft_Visual_Basic</a> it provides source code and information on how to implement a dynamic linked library in visual basic.</p>
<p>As for the Facebook problem I don’t know sorry, I will take a better look tommorow when I have time.</p>

              <p>The C# Facebook sdk works with both web (<a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener">asp.net</a>) and desktop applications. Yes you can use work from a language in the .net framework, in another language of the .net framework by using a dynamic linking library (dll). You must import the dll into your project.</p>
