<p>Yes it does.  It works on anything with a java 1.5 or newer VM.</p>
<p>If you had a problem earlier today, I have fixed it. If you still have a problem (after clearing your browser cache) post again.</p>

              <p>Swine your wrong. I am on a laptop and have been for 3 years and mopar has always worked so idk where you came up with the assumption that it doesn’t work on laptops.<br>
And ant… my suggestion is to make sure that you have the most recent version of java and maybe even go into your task manager and set the client/moparscape web browser to high priority. And if all else fails then i am going to have to assume that it is a POS laptop.</p>
