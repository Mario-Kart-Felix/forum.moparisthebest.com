    <description>My friend rebooted his computer and then he can&#39;t log into his server! I told him to start the runescape client so he can get java... He did and still did not work! I asked him to check if it says install missing plugins and he installed them... Then he had to restart his computer after he installed em.... It still doesnt work.. It shows a grey screen.</description>

              <p>when your trying to run your server. Do this</p>
<p>Open up the SOURCE folder.<br>
Scroll down until you see RUN or RUNSERVER<br>
Click one of them and wait till it says “Source Name” Online!<br>
Then try to log on using silab or some other client.</p>
