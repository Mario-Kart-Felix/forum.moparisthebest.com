    <title>Attention to all who wish to create a Custom Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/attention-to-all-who-wish-to-create-a-custom-server/359517</link>
    <description>I am offering help to all Custom server developers. (I can give advise to other servers too, but I have more experience with custom gear/maps)

I have been away from RSC coding/developing for a while, for various reasons, but I want to help get some new custom servers out there... No I don&#39;t mean the crap gear that&#39;s already there for Subscribers.

What can I do to help.

1. I have a lot of experience with Item modification, NPC editing, and Map making.
2. I&#39;ve been involved with several private servers, not just RSC. (last one I was with was Flamescape... if anyone remembers it)
3. I know how to make a balanced economic based server.

Why should you come to me?

I know my shit.

What exactly can I do?

I&#39;ve had enough experiance to show you how to implement new gear, that keeps balance between the pking and boss fighting within the game.

I am great at solving problems between Economic/Skilling and the Old school/custom pking groups. 

I can show you how to really edit maps... Most is just &quot;snow&quot; and &quot;green&quot; colored, I mean fully equipped, nice looking islands, VIP areas, Pking areas, anything. 

What do I want from you? 

1. if you are a success, put a statue up in edge saying how awesome I am... I&#39;m not looking to make money/free admin or anything. 

How do you contact me?

MSN, Email or Messenger. 

Will I do all the work for you? 

NO, I am just an adviser.

I love RSC, I was going to play, but I couldn&#39;t find any really nice servers besides RSCE and RSCA. So I want to offer some help to those who have &quot;shit 1 week servers&quot; and help them make something that will have a nice player count and some nice custom additions. 

You will have to know how to code, don&#39;t expect to come to me knowing nothing and make the next RSCE, It wont happen. All I can offer is help to those who don&#39;t have a lot of experience balancing a server, or making custom additions.

I can&#39;t be a mod/coder for you, I am currently involved with a non RSC p server, but I can give advise and help you get started.

Do not flame I am only here to help stop some of these source hosted 1 week servers from forming and help them instead develop into something great.

- Send me a forum message if you require my assistance. Removed my MSN from public profile. -</description>

<p>Lol that was more than a joke then anything else, bottom line is, I know how to start a successful server, I know how to edit objects/items/maps, and I’m offering to help for free so we can get some good new servers appearing again.</p>
<p>I’d start my own if I had more free time… so don’t ask why I don’t do it…<br>
[/quote]<br>
What successful servers have you run?[/quote]</p>
<p>I do not run servers, I help people run servers, I am offering to help create a fun server, not make a profit… so I understand why you wouldn’t like me.</p>
<p>I know javascript, I know xml, I know how to edit maps/items… and I’m offering free help.</p>
<p>You haven’t heard of me because I’ve been too busy with college/life to revolve around rsc. I felt like playing and noticed there are no new servers because they have all been sucked into the larger servers.</p>
<p>If you don’t think I can do anything, or help anyone, that’s fine. But if you are starting a new server, and would like some help creating new areas, weapons, monsters, fixing some bugs… I’m offering to help.</p>
<p>I’m not pretending to be something I’m not, I’m just an Old RSC player with experience in Private servers wanting to help people make some decent new servers. Is it bad to want some new server developers who know how to do more than change a source’s name and accept subscriptions?</p>
