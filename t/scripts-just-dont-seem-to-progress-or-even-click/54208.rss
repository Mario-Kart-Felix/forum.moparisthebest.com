    <title>Scripts just don&#39;t seem to progress or even click</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/scripts-just-dont-seem-to-progress-or-even-click/54208</link>
    <description>I used scar years ago with ease but now it seems it just wont function?! I&#39;ve tried using stupid3ooo&#39;s power miner like I did before, it hovers over the ore, say it&#39;s found colors, does not click. Sum&#39;s power miner does pretty much the same thing, as well as starblasters?

I have the includes and the script runs but almost nothing happens? I&#39;m using firefox, also tried I.E my color is on 32bit high?

My screen refresh rate is 60hertz, could that be it?

WTF AM I DOING WRONG?!</description>
