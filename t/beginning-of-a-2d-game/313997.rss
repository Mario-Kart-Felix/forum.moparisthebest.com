    <title>Beginning of a 2d Game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/beginning-of-a-2d-game/313997</link>
    <description>I believe this is the correct topic? regarding it is java programming, just more so development and assistance i guess? :o:

atm i just need some basic help getting a client before i start working on something that i&#39;d probably need to convert from cmd to the client screen later, everything i&#39;ve done was based off small sections of what i believe are things i will be including in the server, so i decided to look up tuts, and followed them for things such as the TCP connection(basically the only thing tbh). any assistance or tips is GREATLY appreciated.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ok, well im leaving moparscape for awile, and i plan on coming back with something decent, and i need some idea&#39;s.

A long time ago, i release a quiz made in java, extremlly 100% basic, but it was a start, since then, i&#39;ve been too busy to start actually learning and working on more detailed games/work. BUT i REALLY plan on making a game, something small, and not something 3d like rs, something basic like,... uh pacman i guess that type of style&#39;d game, but i need some idea&#39;s/opinions on what type of game i should make/start with or atleast what an outline of a game that you would like to see.

I WILL release this when it&#39;s done, like i did with the quiz, it will be an open source, sorted in a folder and compressed, and i&#39;m hoping to make it as small as possible, and as organized as possible, this doesnt mean 3 billion folders, i just mean more sorted text files for to handle certain things, basically a 317 delta with lots of handlers?

I may ask for help or questions, and i will probably update this thread with a section for questions, and ANY help would be appreciated.

I really hope to make something decent, and hopefully impress people for once,and regarding the question, any Links, Video&#39;s, tutorial pages, websites in general, or just your own snippets would be great help for finding idea&#39;s on what to start with or for helping me with problems.

Thanks for reading, and thanks ahead of time for any idea&#39;s you explain to me.

(note): contact me via pm or this topic, i will not be checking other places on moparscape so don&#39;t wait for me to post somewhere an leech off the thread to tell me, i made this topic for reason.

Bye.

=================================

Currently using JCreator IDE btw, here&#39;s some of the stuff i read and worked off from tutorials packed into one class, there are seperate classes as well, just i decided to put them into one for my convience of faster compiling and cleaner cmd while running.
basic concept of this is, it checks the local ip, and host, then moves onto connecting to an ip, for this use any server ip, in the run.bat use
java Main *insert full ip here ex. pur3z525.no-ip.biz*

Then as a test i put an if statement to trigger the following saving, which will be used for player saving, as a result, it saves a text file called Saves.txt.

For full source codes you can get them here although i doubt experienced coders will even need use of this, seeming it was a practical tutorial + self work, should be ready to go, packed it to best quality: http://uppit.com/v/D02I2UN3

<p>uhm @ other posts, conventions were mainly from following tuts, as i said i wanted to get a client working first, then i was going to start over, i was basically making a frame of how i wanted everything sorted, and i was looking through tuts, and the ones that looked like i might have needed to use for things i never knew about, i used.</p>

<p>Well I don’t know about the rest of these xD but I think your graphics design could use double buffering:</p>

<p>A long time ago, i release a quiz made in java, extremlly 100% basic, but it was a start, since then, i’ve been too busy to start actually learning and working on more detailed games/work. BUT i REALLY plan on making a game, something small, and not something 3d like rs, something basic like,… uh pacman i guess that type of style’d game, but i need some idea’s/opinions on what type of game i should make/start with or atleast what an outline of a game that you would like to see.</p>
<p>I WILL release this when it’s done, like i did with the quiz, it will be an open source, sorted in a folder and compressed, and i’m hoping to make it as small as possible, and as organized as possible, this doesnt mean 3 billion folders, i just mean more sorted text files for to handle certain things, basically a 317 delta with lots of handlers?</p>
<p>I may ask for help or questions, and i will probably update this thread with a section for questions, and ANY help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>I really hope to make something decent, and hopefully impress people for once,and regarding the question, any Links, Video’s, tutorial pages, websites in general, or just your own snippets would be great help for finding idea’s on what to start with or for helping me with problems.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and thanks ahead of time for any idea’s you explain to me.</p>
<p>(note): contact me via pm or this topic, i will not be checking other places on moparscape so don’t wait for me to post somewhere an leech off the thread to tell me, i made this topic for reason.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>=================================</p>
<p>Currently using JCreator IDE btw, here’s some of the stuff i read and worked off from tutorials packed into one class, there are seperate classes as well, just i decided to put them into one for my convience of faster compiling and cleaner cmd while running.<br>
basic concept of this is, it checks the local ip, and host, then moves onto connecting to an ip, for this use any server ip, in the run.bat use<br>
java Main <em>insert full ip here ex. pur3z525.no-ip.biz</em></p>
<p>Then as a test i put an if statement to trigger the following saving, which will be used for player saving, as a result, it saves a text file called Saves.txt.</p>
<p>For full source codes you can get them here although i doubt experienced coders will even need use of this, seeming it was a practical tutorial + self work, should be ready to go, packed it to best quality: <a href="http://uppit.com/v/D02I2UN3" rel="nofollow noopener">http://uppit.com/v/D02I2UN3</a></p>
