    <title>My server will not run for me or anyone else</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-server-will-not-run-for-me-or-anyone-else/258320</link>
    <description>Hello, I have downloaded the endless pures source and the endless pures client because they both came together and I thought it would be better and easier to make it into my own so I wouldn&#39;t have to make my own client because I don&#39;t know how lol... Anyways I was wondering why I can&#39;t run it when all I did was like change the client.java and client.class where it said the old ip I think for the person that made the client and source. I changed it to my no-ip thing and now it won&#39;t even run now. I sent the client to my friend for him to check it out and he can&#39;t get it to run either. So I was just wondering how I could make it work or if someone could teach me how to make my own client somehow. Thanks for your time.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: January 24, 2009, 07:16:55 pm[/size][hr]Oh yeah another thing I need to know is like... How do you use any client with your source? Like idk nothing I do works lol...</description>

<p>Alright I will do the server.java thing too… But how would I forward my IP? Is that the same as forwarding ports? I don’t really know what’s the right NO-IP config either because I was just following that one tut on how to do it. Some help with that stuff would also be very much apreciated.</p>
