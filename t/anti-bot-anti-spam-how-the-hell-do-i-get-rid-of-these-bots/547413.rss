    <description>Okay so for some reason I have to do constant maintenance on my website. That includes my sub domains and forums within the sub domains.
Basically, I&#39;m getting way to many bots registering or visiting my website.
Here are my current stats from my cPanel:

Yikes at that CPU though.
I have a pastebin-like system on my website as well. I actually just went in and cleared some 2400 posts to the pastebin. It has a captcha system, but obviously it&#39;s not strong enough to prevent the bots.
Also here&#39;s another example of my site getting way too many hits..
[img]http://puu.sh/cnJAU/97760b7600.png[/img]
That&#39;s a hit counter for a link in one of my smf boards...

Basically, how can I stop these bots from coming to my site? There must be some key word or something that makes it such a big target.

All of my SMF sites have the built in captcha system along with one I added from a package. Most bots do not get past and register, but some still find a way.

Any other info  you want to know? ask ahead.</description>

              <p>I’m not sure if they can get in anyway other than registering like anybody else, however in my past SMF forums, captcha, along with some security questions that pertain to the website itself always worked with no problems. I assume that some of the bots that go through the registration have some sort of AI that solves security questions and what not, somewhere, so if you ask questions that aren’t used over and over like “What is 1+1?” You may get somewhere. (I’d like you to test the above theory lol, as I’ve never had too much traffic on my forums, but from what bots I watched show up on the site never make it past registration)</p>

Also, you cannot <span class="bbcode-i">always</span> trust advertised price. I went to register a domain and went I went between page 1 and page 2 of the checkout, my price jumped up 5 bucks for no reason. Literal. It just decided the domain cost more now. xD</p>

It has a captcha system, but obviously it’s not strong enough to prevent the bots.<br>
[/quote]So try another captcha system?[/quote]<br>
I’ve gone through a couple. I think my current one is holding up fine though.</p>

              <p>Okay so for some reason I have to do constant maintenance on my website. That includes my sub domains and forums within the sub domains.<br>
Basically, I’m getting way to many bots registering or visiting my website.<br>
Here are my current stats from my cPanel:<br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/cnJrx/4db1d8da27.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
Yikes at that CPU though.<br>
I have a pastebin-like system on my website as well. I actually just went in and cleared some 2400 posts to the pastebin. It has a captcha system, but obviously it’s not strong enough to prevent the bots.<br>
Also here’s another example of my site getting way too many hits…<br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/cnJAU/97760b7600.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
That’s a hit counter for a link in one of my smf boards…</p>
<p>Basically, how can I stop these bots from coming to my site? There must be some key word or something that makes it such a big target.</p>
<p>All of my SMF sites have the built in captcha system along with one I added from a package. Most bots do not get past and register, but some still find a way.</p>
<p>Any other info  you want to know? ask ahead.</p>
