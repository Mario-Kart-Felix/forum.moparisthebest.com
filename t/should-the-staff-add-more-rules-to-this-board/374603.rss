    <title>Should the staff add more rules to this board?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/should-the-staff-add-more-rules-to-this-board/374603</link>
    <description>so here are some things i&#39;ve seen in this model section so far and the topics have not been locked

[ul][li]Advertising, advertising different services, this should be what the models help section is for dammit![/li]
[li]Recolors, Make your own damn models![/li]
[li]stealing other people&#39;s models[/li]
[li]Other stupid shit that has absolutely no business in this forum[/li][/ul]

and what the fuck do we do? let the moderators sit on their asses and make out with men. Why does no one care to use their staff positions and lock the damn things, so i say moparisthebest should add someone with modeling experience as a sectional mod, someone with no life who spends all day here modeling and flaming.

I do not give a fuck for these forums as i have my own (but my domain is down so i have nothing else to do). So please pay attention to this and fix it.

Here are some suggestions

Make a posting template (something that a user should use to post with)
Any posts without pictures should be considered invalid
Use a communist-like mentality and do not allow freedom on anything.
Users should have to post with exact standards or receive a lock.

any other suggestions on what moderators should do?</description>

well that’s what i’m trying to solve, get a mod without a life, there are plenty of people i know like that, and the staff should have assigned times aswell for a forum so big. I’m not picking a fight dude, especially with someone like you, a7x 4evr.</p>

<p>If you send me a private message to those topics I’d happily delete them from the board! Don’t be afraid to use the report to a moderator button or even resort to private messaging me rule breaking topics! or hell even msn reporting is good too!</p>

</aside>
<p>the thing is you need to be paying attention to them and not rely on any of these users to send you shit you probably wont respond to. it’s your responsibility not ours.</p>

              <p>so here are some things i’ve seen in this model section so far and the topics have not been locked</p>
<p>[ul][li]Advertising, advertising different services, this should be what the models help section is for dammit![/li]<br>
[li]Recolors, Make your own damn models![/li]<br>
[li]stealing other people’s models[/li]<br>
[li]Other stupid shit that has absolutely no business in this forum[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>and what the fuck do we do? let the moderators sit on their asses and make out with men. Why does no one care to use their staff positions and lock the damn things, so i say moparisthebest should add someone with modeling experience as a sectional mod, someone with no life who spends all day here modeling and flaming.</p>
<p>I do not give a fuck for these forums as i have my own (but my domain is down so i have nothing else to do). So please pay attention to this and fix it.</p>
<p>Here are some suggestions</p>
<p>Make a posting template (something that a user should use to post with)<br>
Any posts without pictures should be considered invalid<br>
Use a communist-like mentality and do not allow freedom on anything.<br>
Users should have to post with exact standards or receive a lock.</p>
<p>any other suggestions on what moderators should do?</p>
