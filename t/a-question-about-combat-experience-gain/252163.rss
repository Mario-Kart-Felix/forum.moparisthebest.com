    <title>A question about combat experience gain</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-question-about-combat-experience-gain/252163</link>
    <description>When you hit something and gain experience, is the amount controlled through a set number multiplied by the damage you deal, or the individual NPC you&#39;re attacking? I want to know for editing experience given. Also, it would be helpful if someone could tell me about experience gains from getting a log from a tree (Normal tree for the purposes of the discussion), or other non-combat instances.</description>

<p>Usually when you gain experience it is based on a value such as your level or the amount you hit on the NPC and multiplied by a set number like you said.<br>
This usually applies to all skills.<br>

I think Runescapes for attack, strength and defense is: (hit ammount) * 4.[/quote]<br>
Yeah.<br>
And if you’re using a controlled style of attack, it gets divided equally among all three melee skills, which is 1.33.</p>
