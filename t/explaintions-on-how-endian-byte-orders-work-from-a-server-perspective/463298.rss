    <title>Explaintions on how endian byte orders work, from a server perspective?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/explaintions-on-how-endian-byte-orders-work-from-a-server-perspective/463298</link>
    <description>[s]Alright, so I&#39;m just defining a few packets, and have gotten stuck on the Item Action 1 packet, here is what I have:[/s]

[code=Java]
	private void handleItemAction1(Player player, Packet packet) {
		int frame = packet.getLEShortA();
		int slot = packet.getShortA();
		int itemId = packet.getShort();
		
		player.getActionSender().sendMessage(&quot;FRAME: &quot; + frame + &quot; SLOT: &quot; + slot + &quot; ID: &quot; + itemId);
	}
[/code]

[s]Have no clue if the frame id is right (don&#39;t even know what that is), the slot is right, but the ID is not, according to the RS Wiki, that short is supposed to have a big endian byte order, I just don&#39;t know how I would go about reordering them, I&#39;ve read what the wiki has to say about them, the big endian ordering the most significant first, and the little endian ordering the least significant first, but I haven&#39;t a clue on how to order this, any help?[/s]

Nvm. Wrong naming everywhere lol.</description>
