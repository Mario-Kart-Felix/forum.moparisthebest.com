    <title>I can&#39;t find Client.Java</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-cant-find-client-java/353781</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;m new to all this, and I had a few questions.

I can&#39;t find the client.java in my server folder. I used the testscape source and I want to change what it says, and add commands and stuff. Also I want to know how to make accounts admins and mods. Can I get any help please?</description>

<p>That was uncalled for.<br>
On topic, Client.java is located in your Source folder in aphabettical order. It should just simply say Client. But, it is a Java file. (Meaning, it looks like a piece of notebook paper.) (DO NOT OPEN THE .CLASS ONE, {IT IS THE BLUE NOTEPAD ONE})</p>

<p>This goes in server help, i never heard of a source w\o client.java. And to make accs mods and admins, its in the char folder, look for the player, and change the playerRights to 1- mod 2-admin 3-owner</p>
