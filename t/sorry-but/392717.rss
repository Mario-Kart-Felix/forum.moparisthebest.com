    <description>Im sorry for the mod that has to lock this but I want everyone to see this instead of just a single post.

This is a Development Teams section am i right?

WHY DO ALL I SEE IS LEECHED SERVERS PRETTY MUCH ADVERTISING AND SAYING THEY NEED STAFF!?

Like this is were you post your work and everyone can see your project mabe you can ask for some help with webdesign or help with the server to be BUILT not come here and have the server DONE that they LEECHED and then ask for STAFF &amp; ADVERTISE!

Thats it  &gt;_&gt;..  *RAGE*</description>
