    <description>Summary, wanna make one event universal, like when i use my meeting command it teles every player in the server to me, thats universal, i dont have my server to work with now so i want people to post how to do it so i can work with it now, because with no example idk how...
How you make somehting universal, i could get it in about 15 mintues but im lazy and need to do homework, and my client got deleted so i cant do it right now neways. like i am going to make some weather stuff but i want it to be universal because i dont want it to be snowing for one person and raining for their freind 5 feet away...its sumthin like a loop through all players maybe?

on a side note can someone please explain to me how the server knows how to handle commands? i bactracked it a little and all i found was a small like 1 line void that sets another variable, and that variable isnt in any other file... i dont get how it knows how to handle it.

probly repeated myself sorry bout wasting space lol</description>
