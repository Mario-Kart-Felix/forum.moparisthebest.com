    <description>Hi, what codes should I add for fully working prayer?

And where should I add it?

I have looked in the tutorials, but they do not work for me.

Can someone please help me?</description>

              <p>Make percentages with numeric variables and operators. Increase max hit depending on percent (for boosting-prayers). For protect-prayers, make a String return method to check the type of attack the opponent is attacking with, and deal with the problem depending on which protect-prayer is switched on. To get rid of client work, I recommend making commands to turn different prayers on and off and add a timer to act as if it is draining their prayer points.</p>
