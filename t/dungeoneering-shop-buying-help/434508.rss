    <description>I need help with buying items in my dungeoneering shop. If i value the item, it says how much it costs, but if i try to buy it, it doesnt buy it. It doesn&#39;t say anothing about not having enough gp or dungeoneering points either. What can i do to fix this? Here is my pastebin for shopassistant.java http://pastebin.com/whGViizV. My shop id is 37.</description>
