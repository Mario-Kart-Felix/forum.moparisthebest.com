<p>We are quite low on staff looking for staff members that are dedicated to the server we launched the server today and within a couple of minutes we ended out with 30+ people online that were pking and enjoying themselves. Remember that can always be you if you tryout DeviousPK, It not a disappointment its a Accomplishment.</p>

<p>The forums are new everything on the server is new so if i’d be you i’d join today and start your Adventure today. There will be a lot of great updates and i assure you that you will like them we are probably gonna put Ovls in pkp shops so its fair for everyone on the server, the Donators Island will be much greater then it was before, Superdonators are gonna be able to do ::bank and a lot more interesting stuff, Lets say it will be worth donating for!</p>
