    <title>Ubuntu 10.04 vs. Puppy 4.2</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ubuntu-10-04-vs-puppy-4-2/342593</link>
    <description>I have a delema, i currently have Ubuntu on my harddrive, but after the troubles on connecting to wireless internet, I decided to look at other distributions of Linux. I want to know, do you think i should go ahead and wipe out Ubuntu and just change to Puppy 4.2, or Stay with it.

My pro&#39;s and con&#39;s of just the little while ive had both.

Ubuntu:
Pro - Nice GUI, (nothing else to decide on yet -.- (is on my harddrive atm)
Con - Cant even get it to connect to something via wireless, but it does find hotspots?

Puppy 4.2:
Pro - Ran this build-in program, and it reconised my Belkin-N card immediately (also currently using via CD)
Con - Not a very good GUI

I just want to know your opinions, since i know very little about either.</description>

<p>Its not the Ubuntu itself i have difficulties with, its just getting it to connect to the hotspots it is able to find. I will download ndiswrapper, and see if i can get it to do anything with that. I’ll let you know if it works.</p>
<p>Didn’t get any further using ndiswrapper. I actually got an error saying “driver already installed” so im guessing i never needed it.</p>
