[b][i]Introduction[/i][/b]
Have you ever lost a text file located deep within you&#39;re computer, and you only remember a few small words that it contained?

Well you&#39;re in luck, I&#39;m currently developing a simple yet useful bit of software to scan you&#39;re computer&#39;s files for pretty much everything! 

Of course, at the moment the program is in a bare bone state. I maybe worked on it around 30 minutes total on and off since last night. So its functionality is limited. As you would guess at the moment you are able to search for all the files in a specified directory, search for a certain extension, and even search for specified text in every file in that particular drive!

I expect to update the program on a daily basis to add new functionality to it, i even plan on allow you to play Mp3 &amp; other media files straight from the program. In the further future i will allow you to share files with friends and even backup files on a specialized server i am currently building!

Let me note that these are just ideas, and the program is still in a very early stage within development. I hope to have a nice stable version out within a month. But you can download a small preview of the program below, and even view some screenshots below that.

2.[quote=“Davidi2, post:28, topic:451298”]General Pony, on this site, you have to learn that the people here can be helpful and give good criticism, but ONLY if you show willingness to learn. Being egotistical about your program and denying that it has faults wont get you anywhere here. A lot of us have to learn that the hard way just like you.</li>

<p>Ignorance, a great way to welcome someone who posted this as there first thread.</p>
<p>Now of course, i don’t need to waste my time here any further. I found this sad excuse for a site (Nice default theme) and figured i would try and keep a few development type logs going. But of course as i figured coming to a site based upon not only  poorly coded software, but also stolen from another company. I would find said ignorance.</p>
<p>You should really get you’re attitude fixed, you won’t make it long in the real world.</p>
<p>And going on the fact of why not improve this software right now?</p>
<p>Maybe i have other things I’m working on? On top of this being my 3rd month studying not only 1, but 4 different programming languages (C#, C++, Java, <a href="http://Vb.net" rel="nofollow noopener">Vb.net</a>) I’m also working on a small Rpg project based upon XNA framework. So i have a lot of time on my hands to argue with you all day over a tiny bit of software i came up with whilst i was bored on a train ride.[/quote]</p>
<p>Honesty, a great way to force you to pull your socks up and filter something a 9 year old could produce to a higher standard.</p>
<p>Oh, please waste your time on this sad excuse of a site (Maybe someone with such a higher intelligence such as yourself would figure to change the theme by the way). Keep your development logs going, of which each “Developed project” is one file consisting of 52 lines of useless code that when thrown together offers no real reason for anyone to use it. Oh, also I’d like to note that this site may be full of poorly written private servers derived off a game - but at least each user participating is actually trying to better their code overall.</p>
<p>My attitude is fine, it’s served me well so far in my life.</p>
<p>If you’re going to post something publicly so that people can give their honest opinion, personally I wouldn’t give it such a half arsed attitude (Maybe you should get that fixed?). Also, learning 4 different languages (Loosely classified <a href="http://vb.net" rel="nofollow noopener">vb.net</a> as a language) doesn’t mean your opinion is solid and correct. You may be learning 4 languages, but from what I can see you might want to focus on one at a time.</p>
<p>Congratulations, you’re writing a small RPG - a lot of members from this useless site full of poorly written code did a little competition making games. How does that make you feel being on par with such “inferior people to yourself”.</p>
<p>fuck off already.</p>

<p>Ignorance, a great way to welcome someone who posted this as there first thread.</p>
<p>Now of course, i don’t need to waste my time here any further. I found this sad excuse for a site (Nice default theme) and figured i would try and keep a few development type logs going. But of course as i figured coming to a site based upon not only  poorly coded software, but also stolen from another company. I would find said ignorance.</p>
<p>You should really get you’re attitude fixed, you won’t make it long in the real world.</p>
<p>And going on the fact of why not improve this software right now?</p>
<p>Maybe i have other things I’m working on? On top of this being my 3rd month studying not only 1, but 4 different programming languages (C#, C++, Java, <a href="http://Vb.net" rel="nofollow noopener">Vb.net</a>) I’m also working on a small Rpg project based upon XNA framework. So i have a lot of time on my hands to argue with you all day over a tiny bit of software i came up with whilst i was bored on a train ride.</p>
