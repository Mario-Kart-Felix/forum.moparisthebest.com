    <title>Unable to run on mac</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unable-to-run-on-mac/517956</link>
    <description>Hey guys, i have been searching and searching, trying and trying to get a rsps going for me to own. But i can understand everything until i begin to press &quot;run.bat&quot; essentially to start the client or what not. But when i do this a pop up appears saying: &quot;There is no application set to open the document “runMoparScape.bat”.&quot;

It does this with most non file things. It&#39;s annoying because I am not sure what application it comes under since it has no application as it is a direct download from the internet.

It would be much appreciated if someone can come up with the solution.

Here are some things I have tried already:

1. Searched on app store. :D

2. Looked for a suitable application to run it on.

3. Tried to got to system/library/coreservice/installer.app

4. Things with terminal etc.

4. Hit my computer a thousand times. ;)

Anyway the main thing is i am mainly trying to get a 317 server going hopefully to own and to develop into a great server. The only thing holding me back is this.

Cheers for any help. :)</description>
