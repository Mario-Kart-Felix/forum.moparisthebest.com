    <title>Creating a NPC + Shop</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-a-npc-shop/393962</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

I&#39;ve recently been trying to add a shop. However it doesn&#39;t seem to work, looked up some tutorials however its not quite working so I was wondering if you guys knew what I&#39;m doing wrong or forgetting. 

I&#39;ve added the NPC in the &quot;npc&quot; file I&#39;ve added it into the &quot;spawn-config&quot; file I&#39;ve added it into the &quot;shops&quot; file (however I&#39;m not 100% sure how to do that so if yo guys can tell me would be awesome) and I&#39;ve added it at the &quot;ActionHandler.java&quot; right underneath the 541 from Zeke. However when I compile it and log on the NPC shows up but when I click it doesn&#39;t show a shop.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
