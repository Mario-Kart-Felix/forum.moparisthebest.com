    <title>Player Updating Help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-updating-help/353726</link>
    <description>Alright. So I am writing a 317 server from scratch, and I need help with how Player Updating. I am done with logins, and have no idea how Player Updating is done. Here are a few of my questions:

[hr]

[b]Q[/b] - What are a few efficient ways to gather all the players that should receive this update, rather than the method Winterlove servers use?
[b]Q[/b] - What bytes do I need to send to the players being updated?

I will add more questions as I venture further and further into the updating.

[hr]

If you do not know the answer, or are just going to post nonsense, then please. I beg of you to not post in this thread.

Thanks.</description>
