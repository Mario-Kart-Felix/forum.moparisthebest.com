    <description>Non-Multi -&gt; Multi Instead of the other way around like it is in the DS source. If you are standing in multi, you can attack as many people as they want out of multi, just so long as you are in multi. Is there anyway to make it the other way around? (Will add examples after school)

Attacking while following/running (with melee) - when someone runs out of the wild or from your specials, it gets very annoying... does anybody know how to fix this? I tried search attackingon2 but I couldn&#39;t seem to find out what to change or where.

Smiting with barrage/autocast - Can&#39;t get these to work together, and when I stand right next to someone with ancient staff auto-casting barrage with smite on, their prayer drains 7 points every 1/2 a second.

Any help or attempt of help would be greatly appreciated ;)</description>
