    <description>ok today i have been looking around to make my own rs2 server, and i have made a server from a difference source than this forum and it has a login screen with no password field, just username and IP.. it has no npcs or anything so its pretty lame...

i know some of the admin commands like ::item iemID and ::myposs ::tele 6478,43344  and i have spawned myself some armour to test this....

anyway i treid getting a server from here (because its better from what my freind tells me) and i registerd at no-ip.com, but i got stuck after the JDK link would not work.... i tried the video and the forum has been moved/delected so i cant follow the indtructions. 

i would like to host a server with a password feild and be able to import/add npcs and be able to attack monsters and other things.... please can somebody help me i been trying to get a proper rs2 server for weeks now  :(</description>
