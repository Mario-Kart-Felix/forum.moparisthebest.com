    <title>Help with changing the background</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-changing-the-background/412503</link>
    <description>Hey guys I downloaded 317 Bronze Age client, the only problem is I want to change the background also the flames but it has no sprites in to change it, so I guess the image is coded in somewhere. The reason I have decided to download Bronze Ages is because I wanted the 2004 game frame and not to mention that the clips are perfect for me.

              <p>Hmm if it has auto cache downloader you need to get the cache change the background and reupload.<br>
Also If the cache is already inside the client you open it up find the background pic and compile. Easy Peasyâ€¦<br>
Though Im Not Sure You Have To Compile <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
