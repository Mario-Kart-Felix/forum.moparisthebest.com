    <description>Okay so when I do the ::master command i get all 99 stat combat skills. But then when I logout and log back in
2 skills have basically resteted. The skills are Magic and Health. But there not actually level 1. When you use a magic attack it resets back to 99 and when you get hit by a npc or a player it restes ur HP back to 99? I have no clue were fix this bug!! 

Help would be very appreciated! 

Thanks!
