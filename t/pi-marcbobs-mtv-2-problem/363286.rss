<p>Problem one I never had this problem or anything. You have to use the same password. There shouldnt be any other reason for it saying invalid</p>
<p>Problem 2 you change your yelltag by doing ::yelltag hi  (for example that makes your yelltag hi so when you do ::yell hey anyone wanna pk it will say, [hi]Username: anyone wanna pk)</p>
