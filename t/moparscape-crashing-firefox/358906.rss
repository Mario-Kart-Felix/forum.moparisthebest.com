    <title>Moparscape crashing FireFox?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparscape-crashing-firefox/358906</link>
    <description>Just today, I began to experience problems when browing the Moparscape forums with Firefox.
I started looking through the Client Hacking tutorials, and it crashed.
At first, I didn&#39;t think anything was wrong, since FireFox crashes on occasion for me.
However, it happened again when I restored all my tabs.
Same result after 3 more tries. :|
After stopping FireFox from restoring Moparscape, it stopped crashing.
When I opened up a new tab and loaded the site again, it started crashing the browser again.
I think this has only been happening in the Client Hacking board though.

Has anyone else ever had a problem with this?
I think the weirdest thing about this is that no other SMF site does this. O.o</description>
