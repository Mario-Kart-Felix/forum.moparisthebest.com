    <title>Writing character files to a SQL Database</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/writing-character-files-to-a-sql-database/332968</link>
    <description>Does anyone have a tutorial for this/is able to tell me how to do it?
I think if anyone does know how to do it, they should write a tutorial for it because the way characters are saved at the moment is the most terrible way to do it possible and I believe that SQL Databases should be a standard for saving info that needs to be kept for every player.</description>
