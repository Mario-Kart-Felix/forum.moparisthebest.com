              <p>Well if you want stronger npcs, you cant actually change the combat level (not possible unless through editing moparscape.) But you can change the hp of the monster making it longer to kill so if its already strong it makes it harder (I.E. TzTok-Jad with 1000 hp.) And for auto-attacking there was a tutorial that DanieB made, butit looks like he has not posted it back up yet, sorry…</p>

              <p>Yes - it depends what you mean by harder. For them to have more hp is easy, go into npc.cfg then press ctrl + f and enter the monster you need to change hp/lvl of. (spaces are _ for example kalphite_queen). Once you find the monster - it will have HP and LVL next to it. Simply change the values to whatever you wish!</p>

              <p>What i started doing was going into file and using “find” to see if i could change anything (Ctrl+F), like, for instance… I needed to find the noclip command in the client.java, so i searched for “noclip” cuz i wanted to make it legal, and add a setitem thing so it logs when people use ::setitem #### #### into my setitem.txt, kicks them, tellls everyone that they are using it, and deletes their entire inventory… All you gotta do is search for it, and if you don’t know what file to look for it in… then just use the search option at the top of the folder bar, its just a matter of finding the code, then looking at it and deciding what can be changed to make it how you want it</p>
<p>Just another example for you, i found the “summoning” section, and i wanted the monsters to be able to be attacked by other players, so i looked at the spot, and simply changed just a few things, added a few things that i saw other places in the file, and it was done <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I dunno about auto-attack, but to make them stronger go into the npc.cfg i THINK</p>
