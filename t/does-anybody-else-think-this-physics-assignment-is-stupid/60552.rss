    <title>Does anybody else think this physics assignment is stupid?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-anybody-else-think-this-physics-assignment-is-stupid/60552</link>
    <description>I just started physics grade 11 this year, and I have an assignment: A biography on a physicist.
I was thinking about going to the hod to try and get out of it, I just thaught I would get some opinions incase I am wrong and look like an idiot.

Is it just me or is that completely irrelivent? The study of physics, is basically how things work. Now a biography is a test on research and english skills. The assignment testing my english, not my physics knowledge.

One might argue that the point is that I learn about physics accomplishments, but they would be wrong. ;)

It is a biography, so I basically say &quot;born then, grew up this way, invented this this and this, died then&quot; in 3000 words. I learn nothing of physics.</description>

We build ridiculously tedious projects which have nothing to do with physics.  So consider yourself lucky.</p>

That may be worth going through (if you can find it at your library) to find a physicist whose work/life you find interesting if you haven’t already.</p>
<p>I guess if you’re just interested in actual quantitative physics, learning the history of it is not satisfying…I really have an interested in learning about the old, famous mathematicians and physicists, but that’s just me.  You don’t really learn concepts or how to work out problems, but you gain a sense of how people were able to come up with such amazing theories and how they were able to apply the knowledge of their time to advance scientific knowledge…that is worth something if you go to work in that field.</p>

              <p>I just started physics grade 11 this year, and I have an assignment: A biography on a physicist.<br>
I was thinking about going to the hod to try and get out of it, I just thaught I would get some opinions incase I am wrong and look like an idiot.</p>
<p>Is it just me or is that completely irrelivent? The study of physics, is basically how things work. Now a biography is a test on research and english skills. The assignment testing my english, not my physics knowledge.</p>
<p>One might argue that the point is that I learn about physics accomplishments, but they would be wrong. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>It is a biography, so I basically say “born then, grew up this way, invented this this and this, died then” in 3000 words. I learn nothing of physics.</p>
