    <description>Ok guys, I have made a topic before close to this, but I found out error. I don&#39;t know what I have done at all, but I tried to edit the drops and drop rate on the KBD, and just KBD, but it has litterly stopped droping ANYTHING, other than charms, and charms only. Also this doesn&#39;t only apply to KBD, for some reason other Dragon&#39;s seem to be affected by this too.. Any help PLEASE? If you suggest putting a code in or anything, put the code in, where I should put it, and under what file. Also, I have 5 &quot;NPCDROP&quot; folders..Why? I have 3 &quot;.TSM&quot; 1 &quot;.java&quot; and 1 &quot;.cfg&quot; Help anyone? Thanks ! Will rep.

I am using Project Insanity, Torvapkz source</description>

I’ll show you an example.</p>

13362:1	13358:1	13360:1	13355:1	13352:1	13354:1	13348:1	13346:1	13350:1</code><br>
8528 is the npc. 20 is the drop rate.<br>
therefore you get 8528:20, meaning every 20 or so kills you get a rare drop. Make sure you use tabs when you put drops in between other drops.<br>
Also, where you see like 443:2000, it means this: 443 is the itemid, 2000 is the amount.<br>
The top row is the normal drops, and the bottom row is the rare drops.</p>

              <p>okay.<br>
what did you do? XD</p>
<p>i’d recomend replacing the files you edited with the ones from the archive and trying again, this time, following the tut more closely.</p>
<p>changing drops and shit are only read by .CFG, it’s really basic.</p>
<p>the KBD is actually the first thing in my drops.cfg.</p>
<p>/<em>npcdrop = (NPCID)	(ITEMID)	(ITEMAMOUNT)	(CHANCE)</em>/</p>
<p><code>
/*King Black dragon*/
npcdrop = 50	1747	  1	100
npcdrop = 50	4675   1	2
npcdrop = 50	1540	  1	15
npcdrop = 50	1149	  1	2
npcdrop = 50	2577	  1	2
npcdrop = 50	2581	  1	3
npcdrop = 50	536	  1	100
npcdrop = 50	1601   5	1	1</code></p>
<p>just edit it in there, you shouldn’t have like five folders. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/open_mouth.png?v=5" title=":open_mouth:" class="emoji" alt=":open_mouth:"></p>
