    <title>CorruptedCraft - Unique In Every Way</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/corruptedcraft-unique-in-every-way/405622</link>
    <description>Friendly Community:
With heavy anti-griefing protection and active and friendly staff we can assure a fun and friendly time for everyone!
Building cities, constructing towns, making friends, etc is not only encouraged but can even be rewarded!


Unique Gameplay:
We offer no monster/animal gameplay mixed with PVP and no health regeneration to give you a survival feel mixed in with that creative touch!
We also offer custom crafting recipes, custom block drops, custom games, custom battles, custom mind maps for rewards such as items, tips, hidden areas, crafting recipes, access to towns, etc..
Imagine trying to figure out that recipe to make bonemeal to grow you&#39;re crops while you and you&#39;re buddies are defending you&#39;re castle and deciding whether you&#39;ll need that diamond armour for the adventure map or you&#39;re better off without it, then realizing whilst breaking stone you found some gold, and just beyond that&#39;s a portal that leads to an area you&#39;ve never seen before!
So many secrets about this server, when you finally think you&#39;ve got everything figured out, you&#39;re just getting started.


I could go more (far, FAR more) into it, but I think you get the point!
