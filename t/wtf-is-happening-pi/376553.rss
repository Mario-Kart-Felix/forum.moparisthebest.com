    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wtf-is-happening-pi/376553</link>
    <description>OK well i was pretty sure that you edit the start location for a new playing under Config.Java And i checked there and my Coords that i want are there.. My coords are at Barb village But when i make a new acc when i log in im at like far side of varrock Multi? The bar... please someone clear this up for me on what to do to make it where i want it..

Also 1 quick EZ. question: On login the message at the bottom says owners are Sagi &amp; Strato , but it only says that when a NEW player logs in.. not a Recent one. A recent player it wont say that but only for a new one

Thanks guys Moparscape helps me alot :D</description>
