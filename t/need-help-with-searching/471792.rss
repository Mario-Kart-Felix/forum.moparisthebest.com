    <description>I have been reading some tutorials, to be honest I am tired of googling, I was thinking of practicing on some rs classic private server, should be easier, so far I can make a hello world program and then use bcel to change the hello message in it but I still don&#39;t get how am I ever going to find something useful inside a runescape client, like my hp for example, how would I search for the class that contains the field or whatever you call it that contains the value of my hp, a piece of example would be nice.</description>
