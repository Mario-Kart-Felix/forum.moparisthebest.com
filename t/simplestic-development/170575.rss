[center][size=18pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/center]
Well, I posted recruits for project un named, both here and on rune-server.net and I have decided to cancel it due to a lack of interest. But all hope is not lost for me, I am still going to persue the goals of this team solo, even if I don&#39;t have the expierience or knowledge to do it, which I don&#39;t, I will learn along the way and I will figure things out. I am going to read some tutorials then get started editing both the server and client. I could use a &quot;tutor&quot; though, I can do some nooby stuff with the server, most compilcated thing I can do really is add some basic booleans and voids :-\, but I am almost completly inexpierienced with the client side of things. Nonetheless, I will strive for perfection of my goals, which I will be discussing in a little bit. But I will frequently update this topic as I make advancements in this project. My goal is to have the server and client 100% done by January 1st, 2009. I started this on New Years Day, 2008, so it gives me a full year to work on it, and I totally think I can do it with some help.

What I Currently Need To Know Now: How to set up safe and wild zones and making players able to attack each other

If you took the time to read that long, boring beginning, I thank you. And if you are looking here because you want to help me, then thank you alot. I am not looking for a full time tutor, but rather multiple people that are willing and kind enough to teach me a thing or two. Anyways, like I said before, I know some basic stuff, but I will need to know some hardcore stuff to finish this project going solo. So if you would like to &quot;tutor&quot; me, please sign up with this application:
