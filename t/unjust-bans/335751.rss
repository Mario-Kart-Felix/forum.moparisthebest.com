    <description>[b]THIS POST IS ON BEHALF OF AMERIKA AND LEWK![/b]

I would talk to moparisthebest himself, but since I am banned from the forums and he nevers get on IRC, I asked a friend to post on our behalf.

First off, I believe that what Lewk and I did was childish, and unneeded.

Second, WE DIDN&#39;T DO 1 THING TO THE FTP. They ruined the FTP part of the site, and therefore caused THEMSELVES HOURS OF TIME, and the so-called $700.

Another point I have is exactly what The Soul said in a previous post ([url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,432078.msg3171778.html#msg3171778]here[/url]), asking Javafire why we (Lewk and I) should be punished on a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FORUM than the incident happened? It&#39;s is rather dumb to be punished for something that didn&#39;t even happen on this forum.

Finally, no one was physically (exlcluding the people in the images we post, which we used to [b]annoy[/b] a SINGLE MEMBER of this site) hurt. Therefore, what&#39;s the damage?

We&#39;ve heard people say we DoS&#39;d the site, and that we used automated software or scripts to do what we did to their Forums. We did NOT USE ANY SOFTWARE. It was all manual effort of copy, paste, submit, repeat.

I know I will be instantly banned or something to that extent, but I am really trying to get a message out there, which was proved in the 3rd point. Why be punished on a completely different forum for something that happened on another, ant-size community.

Again, I&#39;d like to state that Lewk and I regret what we have done, even though we may have found it funny at the [b]time[/b], we realize that we we&#39;re childish. Hope you can forgive us sometime down the line.

Regards,
AMERIKA and `Lewk_</description>

              <p>I do not want this ban lifted early. They should have thought before they did, knowing that the users were originally from MoparScape and would come here and rant about it. As a major community ourselves, you need to respect other communities as well.</p>
<p>Obviously people who thought these trolls were funny will try and lift this ban. What happens when they get their 2nd chance. I’d bet on that they continue their old ways. They should have been banned ages ago (for their constant trolling and spamming).</p>

<p>They haven’t even crossed ‘that line’. All you kids need to stop being cry babies especially you frell. They posted a few things on the kids site. Oh waaa, I checked it out, it’s got barely any members so who cares?!? The posts didn’t hurt anyone in anyway and it’s not going to stop people from joining moparscape, especially the 10 lil kids on that site won’t care after it’s over I’m sure.

I’m kind of on the same road as Anthony with this one. All types of people here, good and bad, make this community what it is. `Lewk_ and AMERIKA happen to be a part of this as well. The trolling will never stop; if you ban one, ~2 more will come back in their place.<br>

<p>Than ban them. If I still had my mod I wouldn’t care if you stayed up two weeks creating accounts.<br>
I would sit there and ban each one on the spot.</p>
