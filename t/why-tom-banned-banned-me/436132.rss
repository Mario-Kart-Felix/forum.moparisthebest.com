    <description>i was told that tom banned me for breaking a mob spawner inside a dungeon, is that allowed??, didn&#39;t grifed or anything, just broke a mob spawner, maybe i&#39;m wrong and this isn&#39;t allowed, but he could have warned me before banning perm...
maybe is because we killed him while pvp was on and he was angry or something, i really don&#39;t undesrstand his attitude towards me...</description>

<p>You always just walked around, just stood in places, had horrible grammar/spelling, and was just a sketch in general. You never seemed like someone that was trusty and that you did a lot of griefing but one block at a time.</p>

              <p>I repeat, we killed tom and sppt before they reached the spawner i broke,i also didn’t know until now that the spanwer couldn’t be rolled back, i’m not a really good minecraft player, i only wanted to kill tom while pvp was on like he did with me in W2, about your house, i know it was offensive what i did, i tryed to rebuild it, but if it’s so important why tom didn’t modified it after i rebuild it??, as he was always complaining that it wasn’t the same??<br>
it wasn’t my intention to be a d**k, i didn’t know about the spawner thing, sorry</p>

              <p>All 3 spawners were found by members of our team fairly, and certainly not within 5 minutes. It sure as hell was luck that we picked the right location, however.</p>
<p>Also, breaking a spawner should be counted as a serious offence in my opinion, as once broken they do not spawn mobs anymore, even if rolled back by Hawk. You’ve caused permanent damage to what would of been a massive area of potential for us, and worst of all, you were seemingly unprovoked.</p>
<p>edit: It’s also very convenient that you happened to be building in the same area as us, and exploring in it. We picked that location at random as it  best suited our needs and desires. There was no previous buildings anywhere near that area, so by right and by the fact that we were there first and found the spawners first, they are ours.</p>
<p>May I ask, why the hell did you break the spawner(s)(?) after just coming off a ban? And more importantly, why did you happen to break our specific spawner(s)? You had just been banned for griefing our old house completely, so was it because you were angry? Just food for thought.</p>

<p>The spawner was clearly lit up around the cave system and had holes in we were using to hit them when they came to us. Hell, 3 members even announced we found it on public chat while some of you were online.</p>
<p>Shortly put I’m done giving you warnings after the show you gave me last time. You’re also a fool to play the “because you xrayed it” card considering I have multiple people who have all your friends pinned on cheating. You’ll find all the mob spawners I own are attached to cave systems which are all lit up.</p>

<p>But I know one of you did it because I was speaking to Nokturth about it. I don’t care about the state you’ve left my mine in as long as you clean it up, you’ve put tunnels digging down everywhere and holes of lava (your group)</p>
<p>It’s the principle of the situation - Punishments are supposed to teach the person a lesson, you logon 5 minutes after your unban and started breaking stuff that isn’t yours to break.</p>
<p>Your ban probably won’t be perm, but it’ll be until you learn to control your mouse clicking habits. You also didn’t kill me, you killed Sppt while he was mining so if anyone would be angry it would be him.</p>
