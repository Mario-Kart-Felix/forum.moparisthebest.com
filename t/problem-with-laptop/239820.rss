    <title>Problem with laptop</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-laptop/239820</link>
    <description>my laptop is fucked up. every so often my cursor goes up or down, in one direction until it cant go any further. is this a virus? i would think for the most part if i had a virus, it wouldnt just move up or down. it only moves in a straight line where i last left the cursor, if someone hacked my account they have some good steady hands. full system scan, nothing. i usually use the pad, i connected the mouse to see if that was the problem. no difference.
restarted computer. nothing helps.</description>
