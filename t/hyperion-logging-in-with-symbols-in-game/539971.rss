    <title>[Hyperion] Logging in with Symbols in game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hyperion-logging-in-with-symbols-in-game/539971</link>
    <description>Would anyone know how to fix the fact that on my server players are able to log in with any symbol and spoof peoples usernames?

for example:

&quot;#Ryan&quot; shows up in yell and regular chat as just &quot;Ryan&quot;.

Anyway to block all symbol characters from logging in?</description>

its been converted to tons of other revisions like 464, 474, 508 (i think) and 562 (i think)[/quote]The original I was mentioning, regardless the process doesn’t change. You will receive the username at some point (probably near the end) of the login block, run it through a method to test its validity and voila.</p>

              <p>Doesn’t hyperion already have this? When the login request is received, run the player’s username through an array to validate all characters - a simple for-loop should suffice. The username is obtained near the end of login in the 317 protocol, read <a href="http://rswiki.moparisthebest.com/index.php?title=317_Protocol" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> for more information on the login protocol.</p>
