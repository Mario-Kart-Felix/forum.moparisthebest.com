    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/portforwarding-help-needed/313186</link>
    <description>Hello All,

I&#39;ve learned a lot lately on rs2 private servers all thanks to the people here, and myself for having a better understanding on what tutorials to google hahah..


But, I&#39;ve came to another stop. . . Port fowarding! :eek:


SO I thought sence you all gave me such good advice before that you could give me good advice again! :)


So I have a Belkin F5D7234-4 (v1) router, and I was wondering if you all could tell me how to port forward it so i could distribute my rs2 private server.    

What I&#39;m asking is can you give me details on how to open up a port forward with all the details? And, where in the files I would go so they njust start the client, and start playing!

Thank you all very much for all, and any help!!

              <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>Thanks for all of your help!</p>
<p>But, I think I have a problem… I went to <a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">google.com</a> and tried the thing to see if my server was online, but it said it was offline. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>And, in the server and client files I turned the i.p. address to my ip address, then tried the port address, then tried the no-ip.biz one, and they still all gave me a “offline” thing on google. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>So, does anyone out there have any ideas on what may be causing this problem? Cause I don’t want to give out the client, and it not work…</p>
<p>Thanks for all your help, and hopefully any help I’m going to get.</p>

<p>(weird problem. . . every time i put in “rune     locus”   it put in google…)</p>

If you want to change something that happens in game like a command you would go into client.java in your source folder. For example lets say you wanted to change the starter message of the server to Welcome to Monkeyscape! You would search for the current welcome message by hitting Ctrl+f in client.java and search for Welcome to. If you have a current welcome messgae it will be in here. So to find your current welcome message, go on your sever and log in. If it says in the chat box “Welcome to examplescape” that is what you would search in client.java. If it said “Potato” in the chat box when you logged in, that is what you would search for in client.java. Now save and compile. If you get compile errors try to change the text inside to your JDK version (jdk1.1.0_16) or whatever. You can find this out by going to C:\Program Files\Java\YOURVERSIONHERE. Input that number into your compile where it looks like it should go.</p>
<p>Omg lol. Sorry if that wasnt to easy to understand.<br>

              <p>First off if you have vista type in cmd in the start bar, right click on it and select run as administrator.<br>
Then type in “ipconfig”<br>
and look for somthing like this “IPv4…192.168.1.1**” (The “*” will be part of you’re ip adress)<br>
you will need the last 3 numbers for later.</p>
<p>Go into your router, if its linksys you gotta type 192.168.1.1 in your web browser.<br>
Then go into “Applications and gaming”<br>
you’ll see somthing like<br>
“Application-----Start----End-----Protocol----IP Adress----Enable”<br>
And under application put “server” under Start put “43594” or you can have it as 5555. and under end put “43594”<br>
Under protocol select “Both” but this should be set already. under IP Adress put the last three numbers (As I showed you above)<br>
it should look like this “192.168.1.1**”<br>
Then you should be done! just check the enable box, and save. Hope you have fun with you’re server!</p>

<p>go to <a href="http://192.168.1.1/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://192.168.1.1/</a> in your browser, log in and find the port-forwarding panel. The rest should be self explanatory.</p>

<p>Well I’ve gotten to that part, and btw for me its <a href="http://192.168.2.1/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://192.168.2.1/</a>, don’t know if that makes a difference.</p>
<p>And, I’ve went to virtual servers, and put 43594 in both of the in bound ports and 43594 in both of the out bound ports… and the type is TCP. Is all that right, and is the TCP right or is it supposed to be UDP or both in the type? (and the description is “mrserver”)</p>
<p>Also, where in the server, or client files, do I change so it works?</p>

              <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>I’ve learned a lot lately on rs2 private servers all thanks to the people here, and myself for having a better understanding on what tutorials to google hahah…</p>
<p>But, I’ve came to another stop. . . Port fowarding! :eek:</p>
<p>SO I thought sence you all gave me such good advice before that you could give me good advice again! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>So I have a Belkin F5D7234-4 (v1) router, and I was wondering if you all could tell me how to port forward it so i could distribute my rs2 private server.</p>
<p>What I’m asking is can you give me details on how to open up a port forward with all the details? And, where in the files I would go so they njust start the client, and start playing!</p>
<p>Thank you all very much for all, and any help!!</p>
