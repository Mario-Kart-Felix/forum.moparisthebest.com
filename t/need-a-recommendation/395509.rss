    <title>Need a recommendation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-recommendation/395509</link>
    <description>Well I&#39;ve downloaded and messed with what seems like hundreds (I&#39;m sure it&#39;s closer to dozens) of sources and they always seem to be lacking in some area, or are already over-coded for what I&#39;m looking for.  

Can anyone link me a source (with a client as well, pref) that has the essentials? (working teleports, bank booths, npcs, etc)  I&#39;m not a good enough coder to start from a complete scrap source, but I also want the source to be fairly clean so I can give it my own taste.  Any and all replies are much appreciated.</description>
