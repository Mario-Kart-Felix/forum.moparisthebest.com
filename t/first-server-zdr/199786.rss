    <title>First server! (ZDR)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/first-server-zdr/199786</link>
    <description>Probably gonna get flamed for this   not really botherd, but the owner of ZDR &quot;ben&quot; gave my mate the source and because he couldn&#39;t host he let me do it, the server will be on 24/7 only every hour it will restart for like 5 seconds or less.

I havn&#39;t changed anything on this server it will not be changed it&#39;s the same as the real owner had it. If you want me to get pictures i will i just assumed you knew what the source is, but if not i&#39;ll get pics.

i just released this yesterday and i&#39;m hoping to get loads of players 
So far 50 downloads 

Client: http://uppit.com/FKMGVL 

Forums: www.theukpk.co.nr

If you want to play this server pm me or go to forums and go to annoucments, remember to play you need the client, well you don&#39;t but if you don&#39;t use the client you won&#39;t see any items! (btw thanks dd for telling me to post here)
About the server: Most skill capes have emotes, fully working prayers, fully working dagger specials, moving fire capes, great pking spots, good timing on all weapons/mage/range.

Don&#39;t flame for taking someone elses server i&#39;m just hosting,  

Remember the server is 24/7! no lagg</description>
