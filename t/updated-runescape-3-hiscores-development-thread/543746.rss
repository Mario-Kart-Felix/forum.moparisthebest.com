<p>I made this development thread about half way through the project. I only updated it once before I found it pointless. This project has been completed, tutorials, download links, and images can be found <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,662661.msg4428907.html#new" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here, in the Server Tutorials section</a>.</p>
