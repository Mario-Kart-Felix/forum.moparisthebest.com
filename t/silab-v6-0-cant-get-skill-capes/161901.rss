    <title>Silab V6.0? Can&#39;t get Skill Capes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/silab-v6-0-cant-get-skill-capes/161901</link>
    <description>Hi. A while ago I got reports from my members that ::pick 10704 was turning out to be a key of some sort. Naturally I investigated this and found that SilabSoft had been updated. I copied her ItemDef into my Item.cfg but when I try to ::pick 14074 (attack skill cape), it doesn&#39;t do anything. It&#39;s only a problem with numbers higher than 11000 (the maximum id I had before V6). I tried making a command (silab1) that would give you most Skill Capes but when I tested this I got a &#39;fatal&#39; error, disconnected and a load of rubbish about OutOfArrays or something on packetsend or something like that. Can someone please tell me what&#39;s wrong![br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 01, 2007, 03:26:29 PM[/size][hr]Also found another error. I can&#39;t seem to eat any type of food. Sorry but I really need help with this aswell. You can be Mod on my server if you fix this!</description>
