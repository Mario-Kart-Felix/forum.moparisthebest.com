    <title>Parents...Computer usage...etc</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/parents-computer-usage-etc/136713</link>
    <description>I am 13 years old, and I&#39;m on the computer for most of my day, this tends to annoy my mom to no end. She is constantly bothering me to &quot;Get off&quot; and &quot;do something else&quot; etc. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m overweight, nor is it like I just talk mindlessly on MSN all day, I program, work on websites, read ebooks, and make a fool out of myself by suggesting the usage of a struct in a Java program. Regardless of what I do, it is seen as &quot;sitting in a chair&quot; and &quot;staring at a screen&quot;. I do a physical work out every day, yet it also seems to count for nothing. I once got into a debate with my mom, which ended up with the conclusion that the only way she would ever be happy is if I did nothing but exercise. Just proves how very little she thinks about this matter -.- 
How can I convince my mom that working on the computer isn&#39;t a bad thing, and that a lot of arguments will be avoided if she just leaves me alone?</description>

Nah, I’ve fixed her computer before, she understands not every 13 year old knows how to program, but it’s just constant “GET OFF” and then she forces me to endure the utterly pointless activities, otherwise known as shopping and hiking to the middle of a field.</p>
