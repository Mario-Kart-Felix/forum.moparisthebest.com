    <title>An evolution essay I wrote</title>

    <description>Note: This is not the complete version, the last paragraph is not in there due to the final version being saved on my school computer.


PROMPT: “For some prognosticators the end of the world was in sight by the year 1000. How do you foresee your world of 2020?”

The body encompasses the vast surroundings of the outer shores. The mildew protrudes the encrusted remains of dead skin. Its porous flesh is pierced by the elongated beaks of famished seagulls. With the whale’s eyes left gazing towards the misbegotten sea.

The world as we know it is bound to change for whales and humans alike. Our evolutionary process which we have so profoundly boasted will cause our eminent destruction. Technological advances have allowed us to see and do unimaginable things, things for the greater good of our societies—the societies of the human race, no other. Mother Earth has sheltered us in her bosom, cradled us in her outstretched arms, and we, as children, have yet to learn the great wisdom of our Mother.

A common misperception as children is our ultimate purpose in our lifetimes. To make the world a better place is a skewed proverb portraying the negligence which has soundlessly become our reasoning. What have we done for the world? Caused countless extinctions within the animal species, destroyed our forests, depleted the ozone, and so much more all for the “greater good” of mankind. With the rise and fall of all great species, natural selection has always taken its course. Our existence began as a lone balloon floating towards the sky, the timid ascent, the boasting rise, bursting, silenced by the perilous demise.

Our persistence towards being humane has altered the entire basis for all creatures around the globe. Being humane has commonly stated that we as humans know better, thus our actions towards each other reflect our society as a whole. What makes us any better than any other species on the planet? We are one of the newest additions to the world, and our qualifications to make these types of assumptions are dumbfounding. If we knew better, why did we destroy our natural habitats? Our arrogance as a species has prolonged the inevitable downfall of the human race.</description>
