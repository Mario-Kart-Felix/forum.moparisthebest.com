              <p>[quote=“amy_webb, post:5, topic:530589”][quote]<br>
In this remarkable book, George Dawson, a slave’s grandson who learned to read at age 98 and lived to the age of 103, reflects on his life and shares valuable lessons in living, as well as a fresh, firsthand view of America during the entire sweep of the twentieth century. Richard Glaubman captures Dawson’s irresistible voice and view of the world, offering insights into humanity, history, hardships, and happiness. From segregation and civil rights, to the wars and the presidents, to defining moments in history, George Dawson’s description and assessment of the last century inspires readers with the message that has sustained him through it all: “Life is so good. I do believe it’s getting better.”<br>

Maybe you should have read the book like you were assigned to do, that would have helped a bit.<br>

This^</p>
<p>Did you expect people on the forums to read the book for you and help you write a thesis? If you can’t be bothered to read, atleast look up a summary and write a thesis about that… Pretty sure there are thousands lying around the internet and they are probably better than answers most people give on these forums anyways[/quote]<br>
i’m not expecting someone to read the book for me, maybe someone knows three reasons why this book is inspirational?</p>
