    <title>Your favorite rsc private servers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/your-favorite-rsc-private-servers/553122</link>
    <description> project pee 2 pee hosted by Matt was my favorite server of all time. The player base was great, the staff was active and helpful, the economy was one of the best of all servers. It just had a great atmosphere to it. Sucks that it had to go down the way it did, its the only place that ever felt like home.   King-Pk would be 2nd place for me, just the massive amount of pking happening a all times at all levels, straight fun.</description>

Having discussed this with stork back in the day, StorkPK source is gone he hasn’t had it at least since '08 and he never sent it to anyone.  The closest thing resembling it has always been VarekD.</p>

<p>I only played RSCA for a couple months before I noticed the trend and switched over to RSCE April 2010.  ProjectRSC never met it’s potential.</p>
<p>RSCE is my favorite, but I really wish I would have been around to play RSCD.  Many still rave about it to this day.  I was simply too late to the RSC private server scene, for I didn’t even know it existed until after I graduated high school lol.</p>

              <p>Another coder and moderator of p2p <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> was invited to do p2p again but no. If only the original had a legit admin. It was fun while it lasted.</p>
<p>King pk was never my thing due to the economy inflating so damn quickly.</p>
<p>RSCD was brilliant.  A 10/10 performance for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>RSCE, kryptix banned me within the first 20 seconds of being online rofl. So never played it, but observing it over the years it’s always had a huge problem with bots and inflation.</p>
<p>RSCR has too much of a fake feeling to even try to get into. It probably has something to do with admins not being true to themselves and trying to act and perform like other past influences who did it before them.</p>
<p>RSCA, what a shit show, was awesome to bot though! Was one of the easier servers to bot on.</p>
<p>DarkQuest, I liked some of the content but it never translated to actually being its own game. So it was quite difficult to get into.</p>
<p>DemonClassic hosted by Zoby, oh man. This server held 200 or 300+ on his home computer and had a great balance with the point system and the economy.</p>
<p>Stork, 10/10 for obvious reasons!</p>
<p>DemonikOnline, so close to being my number 1.</p>
<p>There are a bunch that I cbf to write about,  but I’ll just say that every server has been a stepping stone,  always bringing something new to the table for the betterment of the community.  My favorite times were with servers that you could walk through walls and dupe via trade or duel. I just loved that time.</p>
<p>In order:</p>
<ol>
<li>RSCD</li>
<li>Stork</li>
<li>DemonikOnline</li>
<li>RSCA</li>
<li>DemonClassic</li>
<li>EdgePkz</li>
<li>RSCE</li>
<li>ProjectRSC</li>
<li>DarkQuest</li>
<li>RSCR</li>
<li>KingPK</li>
<li>Reloaded</li>
</ol>
<p>Something along those lines</p>

              <p>project pee 2 pee hosted by Matt was my favorite server of all time. The player base was great, the staff was active and helpful, the economy was one of the best of all servers. It just had a great atmosphere to it. Sucks that it had to go down the way it did, its the only place that ever felt like home.   King-Pk would be 2nd place for me, just the massive amount of pking happening a all times at all levels, straight fun.</p>
