    <title>Changing texturesize?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-texturesize/421588</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to add new textures with Toms Cache Suite,
but obviously there&#39;s a restriction on the size of your file.
Original texture was around 5kb
New one is 12kb, 

When I add the new one, my game freezes, when i resize my new texture till its around 5kb, then it works but then my texture is fucked up.

[b]Is there a way to change the size restriction, or a good method to crop the size of my texture without resizing? [/b]
thanks in advance</description>
