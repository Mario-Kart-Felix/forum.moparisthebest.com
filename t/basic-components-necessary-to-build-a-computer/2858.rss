    <title>Basic components necessary to build a computer ;)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/basic-components-necessary-to-build-a-computer/2858</link>
    <description>Alright I was bored as hell so I&#39;m going to tell you the basic components neccessary to build a computer  :D feel free to add things if I&#39;ve forgotten them. Lets begin:
So a computr eh? When I was little, I always wondered what the hell was in a computer and then I cracked open the case and I&#39;ve magically learned them ;). 

     Anyways First and Foremost is the Motherboard. The Motherboard is almost like the heart of the computer, you do all your crap their and there&#39;s RAM slots in there CPU slot, PCI, PCI Express IDE, and SATA.Your motherboard should come with onboard LAN these days and onboard graphics which is not recommened if you game :P. The motherboard comes in all sorts of shapes and sizes and their  particular sizes include the ATX form factor which is 12&#39;&#39; by 9.6&#39;&#39; the Micro-ATX (woot woot) which is 9.6&#39;&#39; by 9.6&#39;&#39; and BTX Fill me in here, and Micro-BTX same thing. You may need these form factors to figure out a case for a computer although not necessary, a case can provide awesome airflow which means awesome cooling and silence. 

     Mmm.. Second I would guess is the Processor the processor just processes stuff yawnn (juice this up a bit people thanks :)

     Third! The fans very neccessary the processor these days, without a heatsink can explode in a matter of seconds so a heatsink check out this pic =) [img]http://images10.newegg.com/NeweggImage/productimage/35-101-001-02.JPG[/img] which is a pretty decen ASUS heatsink. And of course there&#39;s the fan for the case.. You should consider getting liquid cooling for your computer only if it&#39;s at a pretty decent clock speed, pretty hot as in dunno 60C for Stable Temps and 70C under load, and is loud as hell even with great airflow.

     Fourth mmmm the Hard Drive well the Hard Drive these days are now using Serial ATA (SATA) which the cable is smaller and more compact then IDE. Yep...

     Fifth mmm Optical Drives CD-ROM DVD-ROM DVD+-RW floppy yep....
      
     Fifth hmm ahh yes the Power Supply which is an essiential part without power your computer can&#39;t run (Duh).

     Sixth Case yep case matters..Pretend you have great cooling but is as loud as hell some one else could have the same processor and cooling gears but is silent, that&#39;s airflow. I would reccomend you to get a case with a fan on the front of the computer a fan on the back and a side vent for pretty good airflow. 

     Seventh RAM yeah you need RAM, it stands for Random Access Memory these days OS&#39;s are very demanding and maybe require at the least 248 MBs of ram

     Eigth and OS or Operating System whether it be Windows, Linux or MAC the decision is yours  ;)

Well I think that about covers it feel free to add anything 
Thanks. 

     EDIT: Let&#39;s add a pic of a MoBo Shall we?

NOTE: The MoBo is an ATX form MoBo with 240pin DDR2 RAM slots</description>

<p>no its more like the processor is the P.I.M.P and sends his homies out to other homies so they go meet somewhere and do something</p>
