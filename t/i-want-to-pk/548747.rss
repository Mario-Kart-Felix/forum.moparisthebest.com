    <title>I want to pk</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-want-to-pk/548747</link>
    <description>I want to start playing osrs but I am lazy and don&#39;t want to train. Does anyone know legit sites you can buy accounts off of? If there&#39;s too high of a risk of people recovering then obviously I won&#39;t.

I either want a great pure or a great main. My budget is very large and can get this done. Do you guys think if I buy off someone with tons of posts on sythe and I get the email set to it, I&#39;ll be safe?</description>

Not the official rules, but I think he’s right. My “gatherer” bot got banned but my account I actually play/check didn’t get banned.</p>

<p>it doesnt take long to train honestly. especially since jagex doesnt ban “afk” training now.<br>
[/quote]So do bots not get banned as long as you at least attempt to move around?[/quote]i honestly don’t get it. most bots are easily detected but they won’t ban afk magic splashing/guthan bandits.</p>
