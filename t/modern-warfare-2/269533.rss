    <title>Modern Warfare 2</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/modern-warfare-2/269533</link>
    <description>Infinity Ward has released their first &quot;teaser&quot; trailer for the expected hit game &quot;Modern Warfare 2.&quot;  

http://www.gametrailers.com/player/47178.html

Watching it the first time you will be rather disappointed with what you see, as you&#39;ll be wondering what in hell is going on.  I suggest watching it more then once, as the more you watch it, the more things start to make themselves more clear.  I have some of my own thoughts which I will post a bit later on.

[b][u]Guns[/u][/b]
- Steyr AUG A1
- AK-103
- Colt AR-15</description>

showing those three different characters Rio de janiero 2 doesnt point to character customization at all, COD4 had about 3 different models for each online time. Also random lights? those white lines look painting on a runway so they are probably runway lights. Also you need to get a life<br>

unless they’ve changed it to about 10 different models for each team with a variation for the classes</p>

<p>For this short clip, I have taken a few screenshots and pointed some things; if anyone has any other pictures that they feel are important (every frame is not necessary, as a lot of the frames focus on one picture for a few seconds) please feel free to post them.  If you wish to view these pictures in a bigger size, click the “Bigger” link beside the explanation.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#1</span> - Special Forces 1<br>
<img src="http://i184.photobucket.com/albums/x231/Rylee1010/specforce1r.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
<a href="http://i184.photobucket.com/albums/x231/Rylee1010/specforce1.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Bigger</a></p>
<p>In this screenshot, we see of course a Russian special forces team, which may possibly be footage of the new special forces mode.  We also see the obvious implication of riot shields, which will be fitting with this mode (as seen).  We also see the Russian flag, which shows us that these are definitely Russians.  In the back, we see the landing gear of an airplane, which leads us to believe this may be happening in a hanger or warehouse.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#2</span> - Special Forces 2<br>
<img src="http://i184.photobucket.com/albums/x231/Rylee1010/specforce2r.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
<a href="http://i184.photobucket.com/albums/x231/Rylee1010/specforce2.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Bigger</a></p>
<p>In this screenshot, we again see another Russian special forces member who is holding a riot shield.  We also can clearly make out the characters’ gun: it appears to be a HK UMP .45.  On his back, there is rope, which may be used for repelling?</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#3</span> - Airport<br>
<img src="http://i184.photobucket.com/albums/x231/Rylee1010/airport1r.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
<a href="http://i184.photobucket.com/albums/x231/Rylee1010/airport1.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Bigger</a></p>
<p>In this screenshot, we can see a character holding what appears to be an M4 Carbine (or other variant).  Around him, we see several airplanes, and what appears to be a boarding bridge to the upper-left of the screen (which is used to get people into a plane; if you’ve been on a plane, you’ll know what I’m talking about).  On the bottom, there is a luggage “trolley” (for luggage transportation).</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#4</span> - Rio De Janiero 1<br>
<img src="http://i184.photobucket.com/albums/x231/Rylee1010/riodejaniero1r.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
<a href="http://i184.photobucket.com/albums/x231/Rylee1010/riodejaniero1.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Bigger</a></p>
<p>In this screenshot, we see three characters preparing to jump.  We also see an M4 Carbine or other variant.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#5</span> - Rio De Janiero 2<br>
<img src="http://i184.photobucket.com/albums/x231/Rylee1010/riodejaniero2r.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
<a href="http://i184.photobucket.com/albums/x231/Rylee1010/riodejaniero2.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Bigger</a></p>
<p>In this screenshot, we see the three characters actually in-air.  While there’s not much more to notice here, we have to look closer.  Each of the three characters are customized completely different: one character appears to have a Mohawk type hairstyle, another is wearing a helmet, and the final character a mask (perhaps like the ones the SAS use?).  Additionally, there appears to be increased gesture reality.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#6</span> - Unknown<br>
<img src="http://i184.photobucket.com/albums/x231/Rylee1010/unknown1r.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
<a href="http://i184.photobucket.com/albums/x231/Rylee1010/unknown1.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Bigger</a></p>
<p>In this screenshot, we see a character which appears to be Soap, to his left, we see what looks like a hostage/enemy or even an airplane pilot tied to a chair.  We also see some random lights which have an unknown use.</p>

<p>In this screenshot, we see crashed/destroyed airplanes, and then we see a sign where “Lot” can easily be made out, but the other side of the sign cannot.  To the right of the destroyed plane, is the explosion of a car; as you can see, the car has flown into the air when exploded (increased reality?).</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#8</span> - Rio De Janiero 3<br>

<p>In this screenshot we can clearly see the location is Rio De Janiero, due to the statue seen in the top-left.  Stealing the spotlight is the character that appears to have tackled an enemy/hostage/civilian.  We also see shards of glass, which show even more realism.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#9</span> - Rio De Janiero 4<br>

<p>Similar to the last image, comes this screenshot: notice the car that was originally there in the previous shot?  Perhaps cars will dent when they are landed on?</p>
<p><em>These next few screenshots were seen in the gamplay reveal promo; some analyzation is inspired by GT.</em></p>

<p>Fighter Jet (possible F-15?) is seen flying over what appears to be a Little Bird with a solider inside holding a Sniper/Bolt-action rifle.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#12</span> - Gameplay 3<br>

<p>We see the after-shock of the “hip-toss” melee move, along with the Steyr AUG A1 that the victim is holding.  Behind him, we see a solider that has dropped their gun due to the explosion of the fighter jet (increased physics).</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#13</span> - Gameplay 4<br>

<p>Another MH-6 Little Bird is immediately seen on the ground with what looks a mountain (or the clouds/smoke behind the MH-6) behind it.  To the right we also see a Jeep.</p>

<p>In this screenshot we are on a snowmobile, chasing a hostile.  The hostile is holding an HK UMP .45.  On the snowmobile, we see two hostiles: this gives us even more of a clue towards snowmobile gameplay.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#15</span> - Gameplay 6<br>

<p>We see a heat-censored (airstrike) that is about to hit a public place (shopping center or mall?).  This place also has handicapped parking spots which may help us to identify the location.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind this is what I am seeing, and if anyone can confirm what anything truly is, whether it be guns or anything at all, then by all means post.</p>
<p>Seeing as there a lot of different opinions regarding guns, here is the list of guns that have been identified by users posting in this thread:</p>

<p>Way to contradict yourself. I suggest you seek a job at the naming department at Capcom, or even Rockstar games, I’m sure you’ll do fine deciding the release names of the Resident Evil, and GTA series.</p>
<p>I mean fair enough, I wouldn’t call call it COD5 if it was an expansion to COD4, but it’s pretty much a different game, even if it was only reskinned.</p>

<p>I’ll suck dick if it keeps the trend of balancing weapons by making the weaker automatic weapons more powerful, or no customizable ranked lobbies/game browser as well as matchmaking, or a feature so you don’t rejoin a game after leaving it while using matchmaking, or if it doesn’t fix the horrendous syncing issues, or if it doesn’t balance double tap, juggernaut and stopping power and/or buff the perks in the same class up, or if martyr isn’t nerfed to where you can no longer fire after you loose so much health(and then drop a grenade unless you are killed, much like how last stand works except automatic), or if the random spraying = headshots isn’t nerfed.</p>

<p>Not only is there no number, it’s not even “Call of Duty.”</p>
<p>Edit: Low ad behold I just went to the store and (thankfully) managed to pick up a copy of the June edition of the Game Informer magazine.  Of course I will be distributing the text that the member of the IW forums gave me, but I will have a look through it and scan some pictures for you all to see.</p>

<p>It’ll probably be terrible, as well as COD7 whenever they plan on releasing that.</p>

<p>COD7? There isn’t even a cod5 yet. And plus this is made by Infinity Ward not Treyarch so might not be too shit. Teaser/Trailer is shit though.</p>

MW2 = COD5, WAW wasn’t numbered. Look at the box theres no “5” on there. Ok it was labelled as cod<span class="bbcode-b">5</span> but there hasn’t been a cod5 yet.</p>

              <p>Game Informer has released a magazine with 10 pages devoted to Modern Warfare 2, now available in the US at GameStop among other gaming stores and other locations.  A member of the Infinity Ward forums was nice enough to send me the text of the 10 pages, and I will be willing to distribute it to anyone who pm’s me (due to possible copyright infringement (as the member of the IW forums has stated)).  Please remember I do not take credit for this text.</p>
