<p>There are only about 7000 Royal Marines at one time, there may be far few less sas troops but you have to join the army to start with. Everyone says that the sas are amazing, so are the royal marines, but do you hear of the sbs? Anyway as for the Royal Marines 99.9% of people need not apply, BECAUSE the training is so difficult.</p>

I was referring to the United States Marine Corp - I don’t even consider the Royal Marines as enlistment service. I, along with any other person who knows a thing or two about them, would agree. They very much deserve the rank of special service. Only reason they’re not; the pass rate.</p>

You do not need to start with Army to join the Special Air Service; in fact, in Australia more people have passed the training, and originated from the Navy as a Clearance Diver in the Tactical Assault Group (East), seeing as they pretty much work with the S.A.S (yes I know, Tactical Assault Group (West) hosts the Special Air Service, but the two work together <span class="bbcode-b">alot</span> in foreign affairs [don’t get me confused, they don’t train together, but they work together]), they’re basically prepared already.</p>

Tough isn’t the right word for it. “We don’t aim to test you, we aim to kill you” is the old saying since the formation of the service.</p>

Another thing I really find annoying about the modern warfare games, is the ‘OpFor’. ‘OpFor’ stands for Opposing Force, and it is a branch of the American military used in training drills. Why on earth would the US Army Rangers fight the US Army OpFor?</p>

<p>They don’t rank higher than the US Army, stop spinning shit. They’re the Infantry of the Navy. They specialize in force projection from the sea, or force projection from Naval vehicles. Yes, this does include the rope-slide out of helicopters, seeing as they are Naval Seahawks. Marines aren’t as well trained as you think they are. They think they are gods gift to the earth, and that they are special because they passed the 6 weeks training before shipping out for war. The whole ‘hoorah’ thing drives me crazy.</p>

<p>Hmm well for the british army they have the standard training… But for the Royal Marines their training is known as the toughest training around… So for us… Royal marines are better trained then the standard british army<br>
[/quote]<br>
I was referring to the United States Marine Corp - I don’t even consider the Royal Marines as enlistment service. I, along with any other person who knows a thing or two about them, would agree. They very much deserve the rank of special service. Only reason they’re not; the pass rate.</p>

<p>then there’s the shit the SAS have to go through, thats seriously tough</p>

</aside>
<p>There are only about 7000 Royal Marines at one time, there may be far few less sas troops but you have to join the army to start with. Everyone says that the sas are amazing, so are the royal marines, but do you hear of the sbs? Anyway as for the Royal Marines 99.9% of people need not apply, BECAUSE the training is so difficult.</p>

</aside>
<p>They reckon theres only about 250 SAS soldies and only 2 troops… one out in foreign wars and one doing counter terrorism</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Noone knows how many troops there are assigned to the S.A.S. There are a few numbers floating around on the internet, but mark my words; <span class="bbcode-b">noone</span> outside of the service knows.</p>

<p>You do not need to start with Army to join the Special Air Service; in fact, in Australia more people have passed the training, and originated from the Navy as a Clearance Diver in the Tactical Assault Group (East), seeing as they pretty much work with the S.A.S (yes I know, Tactical Assault Group (West) hosts the Special Air Service, but the two work together <span class="bbcode-b">alot</span> in foreign affairs [don’t get me confused, they don’t train together, but they work together]), they’re basically prepared already.</p>

Another thing I really find annoying about the modern warfare games, is the ‘OpFor’. ‘OpFor’ stands for Opposing Force, and it is a branch of the American military used in training drills. Why on earth would the US Army Rangers fight the US Army OpFor?[/quote]</p>
<p>Um i read on the british army site that you need at least 2 years in the british army to tryout for the british sas.</p>
<p>As for the “no one knows how many there is”</p>
<p>Fair enough thats right… Thats what people think</p>

<p>Ill have to agree with you on the killstreak thing, some are way to over powered ESPECIALLY the gunner, Along witht he tactical nuke. 25 Killstreak and you call it in EVERYONE dies and your team automatically wins.</p>
<p>Predator missile is win tho.[/quote]</p>
<p>You get used to the nuke, it doesn’t phase me. It’s fucking awesome when you get one though, knowing you have the power to end the game with a flick of a switch. Honestly, when the other team gets nukes, me and all my friends leave the game for teh lulz.</p>
