    <title>Glow (Repping)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/glow-repping/447978</link>
    <description>Hey, I would like to add a glow to either the cape or the actual character in the game. These glows will all be different colours and would be activated if you had, for example, 99 herblore would give you a green glow. All moderators/owners/donators will have certain colours. Does anyone know how to add this? I tried using gfxs but all the glows were just like the dragon battleaxe special. Would I need to add a new custom cape exactly like a skill cape but with a glow? Sorry for the long post and thanks for any answers.</description>
