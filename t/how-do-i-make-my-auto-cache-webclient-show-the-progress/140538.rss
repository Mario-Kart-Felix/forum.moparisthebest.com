    <title>How do I make my auto cache webclient show the progress?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-make-my-auto-cache-webclient-show-the-progress/140538</link>
    <description>How do I make my auto cache webclient show the progress? As in show a percent or a loading bar thing.

I have a webclient that loads the cache fine, but when it loads it looks like it freezes for a few mins then its done, My users think the game just freezes all the time, So I really need to know how to do this. Thanks a lot for who ever helps.[br][size=1]Posted on: September 04, 2007, 04:34:20 PM[/size][hr]Nobody knows?</description>
