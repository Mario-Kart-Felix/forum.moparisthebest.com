    <description>im just saying i think the rsc server development thing is going down the shitter, its just my opinion, because everyone is DDoSing other peoples server so they get more people. It&#39;s getting very annoying and shitty, seriously, people spend at least sometime doing servers and other people have to ruin it by hacking/db hacking and ddosing each other, nobody can accept that there is other rsc servers. I just think its un thoughtful to do that. we are trying to bring back rsc but all we get is &quot;0mfgz, Sw4g r dd0sedz, oh n0ez&quot; and shit like that, idk about you guys i just think this community is in the gutter atm, im going to play this stuff again once its going good again like when ddosing didnt happen much
so farewell for a while.</description>

              <p>RSC was dead years ago<br>
No point in making a private server because no one is going to play since we all assume it will be taken down again shortly. I’ve played on 2 private servers, 1 where I reached 99 99 99 and then it was gone. I don’t think I could put that much energy into it again and I doubt many other people would either… Private servers were cool when they were new, but now they are old and not reliable enough. If someone could keep one up for a while then maybe this forum would come alive again, but it’s just too much of a waste to start playing, knowing the server won’t last long.</p>

Even though I am your friend, I don’t think you’re in any position to be calling anyone an idiot when it comes to Runescape cheating. When was the last time you had anything to do with Runescape, other than playing it?</p>

<p>Development on this forum is dead, because all the development that does get done do not get done on these forums.

<p>The smart one’s who can do something, know it’s not right to come post on these forums. These forums are just about help setting up a server and server advertisement. I doubt it will ever change too.[/quote]</p>

              <p>But that’s where your wrong, people here are not trying to bring back rsc servers, a few out of a hundred maybe but all the rest is some shitty 2 minute servers who cannot advance in anyway.</p>
<p>Development on this forum is dead, because all the development that does get done do not get done on these forums. I know a bunch of people who i talk with in other places other than this that do development. Except the word Development in these forums is completely ruined and you’ll notice there’s not much development around here, because it’s all private.</p>
<p>The smart one’s who can do something, know it’s not right to come post on these forums. These forums are just about help setting up a server and server advertisement. I doubt it will ever change too.</p>

              <p>im just saying i think the rsc server development thing is going down the shitter, its just my opinion, because everyone is DDoSing other peoples server so they get more people. It’s getting very annoying and shitty, seriously, people spend at least sometime doing servers and other people have to ruin it by hacking/db hacking and ddosing each other, nobody can accept that there is other rsc servers. I just think its un thoughtful to do that. we are trying to bring back rsc but all we get is “0mfgz, Sw4g r dd0sedz, oh n0ez” and shit like that, idk about you guys i just think this community is in the gutter atm, im going to play this stuff again once its going good again like when ddosing didnt happen much<br>
so farewell for a while.</p>
