By the way, I‚Äôm not having you do all the stuff I don‚Äôt feel like doing. That is not why there is so much questions. This is all stuff I attempted to do already and I couldn‚Äôt figure it out. I also eliminated some stuff that I will ask later when it‚Äôs more important. I am still looking around for answers to any of these:</p>
<p>[s]stop npcs from walking through walls (when i ran away from an npc inside of a castle it followed me and when i looked back it went back to its place and to get there it went through a wall???)</p>
<p>Can you give me some tips to keep the economy good.</p>
<p>Change trees (some of them look really wierd bc they are custom made by someone)[/s]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-s">I need to clean up my cache if u can get me tips or how to‚Äôs that would be great and if u want i could send u the cache to do it yourself because its such a big file <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowningae52.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> It‚Äôs 205MB when it‚Äôs not in a .zip file.

<span class="bbcode-s">fix examine for items instead of examine saying<br>

on the teleports take off the incorrect description for example instead of the description of the Monster Teleport says Teleports you to Varrock</p>
<p>some npcs open a shop if you talk to them I need to make those npcs say something like<br>
‚ÄúHiya. It sure is a nice day in the world 1 of DestinyScape!‚Äù and when you want to shop you have to right click and trade them. The problem is I don‚Äôt know how to force them to have a trade option. Do I just add the text and it does it automatically?</p>

        <p>For NPCs going through walls: You need to add NPC clipping.<br>
For good economy: Don‚Äôt put EVERYTHING in shops. And make sure coins are worth something. Don‚Äôt put in a money making method that can make you max cash in an hour.<br>
Change trees: Get a different client or take out the crappy tree models.<br>
Take off custom items: Rename it in the item cfg file and remove them from class8.java in your client<br>
For the monsters ‚Äòturning to weird shapes‚Äô when they die: Fix their death emotes to match their proper emotes.<br>

<blockquote>make the character appear at home each time you log in instead of the area where u logged out</blockquote>
Why would you want to do that? And uhm, just take the coord x and coord y out of the player saving and make sure their original values are the home coordinates.

        <p>-Can you give me some tips to keep the economy good.<br>
Don‚Äôt load mystics, ancient staves, large amounts of foods, etc.<br>
Mystics can be obtained by killing infernal mages, no point in all the mages running around with mystics.<br>
Ancient staves are also obtained from infernal mages with the same concept.<br>
Make people work for their food/potions, so the economy is skill based rather than shop based.<br>
Take out dumb shit such as dragon armour, whips, furys, etc. from shops; they should be earned.</p>

<p>[size=36pt]Thanks!![/size] Your advice was sooo helpful! I‚Äôm gonna try out the code l8tr on I‚Äôm still testing my server for bugs. It looks about right. I would make you go to home at login because of cheating and if you login and your internet is slow it may take a bit and if your in PK someone could get a free kill. Usually that wouldn‚Äôt happen but it‚Äôs happened to a lot of people on websterscape. that was my first rsps. So how would I change the monsters ‚Äòdeath emotes‚Äô? I‚Äôll look up a tutorial for the NPC clip It probably won‚Äôt be hard to find. Thanks again! Keep up the good work!</p>

Those are great tips! The doors being deleted: I figured it out, your close but you have to use the object void thing inside of object manager or something like that. I dont have that major glitch with the torag hammers and guthans chainskirt 0. But you can probably find a fix somewhere on <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a>. :3 I‚Äôm going to use all of your economy tips along with all of Kanes economy tips. I knew that about the examine so I figured I would keep most of them normal but change some. But that would just be a waste of time because it doesn‚Äôt matter if I have a good RSPS anyways. Your great keep coding and helping people on mopar youll be as good as I_Vain_I eventually [size=36pt]You too Kane!!![/size]</p>
