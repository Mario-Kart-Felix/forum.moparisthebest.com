    <title>Upgrade in a couple of months, suggestions?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/upgrade-in-a-couple-of-months-suggestions/395974</link>
    <description>Alright, i&#39;m going to do a bare-minimum upgrade of cpu, motherboard and memory. The plan is something along the lines of a 3.2ghz i7, 12gb ram and an appropriate motherboard for a reasonable price. My budget is basically infinite, but realistically i don&#39;t feel like spending over 1k euros.

Gogo suggestions!</description>

It just depends how much you want to spend.  You can spend $2000 on a CPU that will be a $400 CPU 3 months from now, so unless you have a lot of money you just want to throw away, you have to draw the line somewhere.  I’d rather have a ~$200 CPU that isn’t the absolute top of the line, but isn’t noticeably slower than it either, and will still last for years.</p>

<p>€985.53[/quote]The RAM there is attractive as fuck due to it being 3 sticks rather than 6. Means i can be a bad boy and get 24GB eventually (epenis growth + 500000). The motherboard is quite expensive, i’ll probably get a cheaper one instead. The CPU however looks like something i’ll get.</p>
<p>Thanks for the tips!</p>

              <p>Alright, i’m going to do a bare-minimum upgrade of cpu, motherboard and memory. The plan is something along the lines of a 3.2ghz i7, 12gb ram and an appropriate motherboard for a reasonable price. My budget is basically infinite, but realistically i don’t feel like spending over 1k euros.</p>
<p>Gogo suggestions!</p>
