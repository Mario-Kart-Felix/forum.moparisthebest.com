I am currently looking for a few experienced Client, Server, and Forum Developers, I&#39;d prefer it if you would be well rounded and looking to be completely serious about helping out with the development of Revived Destiny.

I am especially looking for someone who is quite well with webclients also!

Some of the perks of joining our development team is you will have an experience you have never had before with any other RsPs out there!

We currently have multiple Open positions for Developers! So Apply now! I don&#39;t tolerate trolling so there really is no point in applying if you aren&#39;t going to be dedicated to the development of this one server!

              <p>It would be better to make this server to a different server. I am sick of all these servers being the same, then claiming that we’re better. If you look at top-servers, all of them are the same, so why do people claim that there server is more superior to the other if they just share equality. I hope you make a special something to your server to get that extra spicy touch into it. Try to make like, your own code, for that you will surely be successful. I hope you also observe your code, because if you don’t, then I will be like, urrrgggggggggg! SO please, I beg of this server to stand away from the other horrid servers and stand out to be the best.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

for one rep has nothing to do with it… and adding npc’s shops’ and changing home to a source doesnt show good development. thats basic stuff anyone can rip out of a tutorial. your argument is invalid. good day to you sir.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Anyone with Higher rep whom had actually earned their rep constructively criticizes most of everything instead of posting a 2 word reply. And I’m bug fix oriented, I’ve fixed about 99% of the dupes on this base and working on other things, and the start of a good server is a good home. And find another server with this home, By the time you do I should be able to rep you.[/quote]I earned all my rep legit so shut the fuck up kid and also all you did was leech insidnia x and call it a development and acctually takes time and effort to make a development you can’t just download it and start a development team because you can’t develop for shit…</p>
