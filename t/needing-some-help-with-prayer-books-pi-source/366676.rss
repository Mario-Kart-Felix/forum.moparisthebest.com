    <description>hey, i dled tragedy pking source and im editting it atm, i want to add the speech for the prayer books like last rites etc, and i think im on the right track here but how would i make the player say this above his head

&quot;Thy cause was false, thy skills did lack; see you in Lumbridge when you get back.&quot; 

my code is this atm[code=java]			case 3840:
				c.sendMessage(&quot;Thy cause was false, thy skills did lack; see you in Lumbridge when you get back.&quot;);
			break;[/code]
this is for the sara book, and if anyone could give me the code for adding the anim i would apreciate it very much.
also where would i add the option part to? clicking most or action handler?


OK i got the forcedChat working, but how would i make an option pane appear when its clicked then link it to say different things like wedding ceremony, last rights etc??

any help atall is greatly apreciated</description>
