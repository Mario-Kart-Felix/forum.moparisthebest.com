    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-webclient-has-a-mind-of-its-own-pi/381142</link>
    <description>I made a webclient for my server, and it workd 100% for me and a select few of people. But some other people it doesnt work. When they try and load the webclient it skips loading the cache and just freezes. Any Ideas?</description>
