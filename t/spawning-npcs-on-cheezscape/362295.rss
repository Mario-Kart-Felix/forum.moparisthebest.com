    <description>ok...heres the deal that im in...im using cheezscape base server and i need to spawn 8 NPCs i have absolutly no idea how to do this as the server guide doesnt have a command that i saw.

<p>autospawn.cfg in your cfg folder, now type this in</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = AAAAA   XXXX    YYYY    xxx2    yyy2    xxx3    yyy3    0    1</code></pre>
<p>AAAA is the NPC ID<br>
XXXX is the x coord<br>
YYYY is the y coord<br>
xxx2 is the second x coord - edit if you want your npc to move<br>
yyy2 is the second x coord - edit if you want your npc to move<br>
xxx3 is the second x coord - edit if you want your npc to move<br>
yyy2 is the second x coord - edit if you want your npc to move</p>
<h2>dont remember what the 0 and 1 mean so just leave them alone.<br>
if you dont an npc to move just set all the xxx2 and stuffs to 0.</h2>
<p>onto renaming, open up client.java and search for cheez and just replace all the cheezscape names and stuff to roidscape.</p>
