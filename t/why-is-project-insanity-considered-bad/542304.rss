    <description>Why do most RSPS coders, intermediate - advanced, say that Project Insanity (PI) is a shitty base? I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s good, I&#39;m just wondering why.</description>

Say that again when you can’t support more then 20 players or when 90% of your game content contains a dupe. What about that heavy benchmark? There is also instability + you can’t say it’s good code when you know there’s a memory leak. You can’t expect developers to fix bad code for you.</p>

<p>there’s a lot more to project insanity that’s bad than just dead code.</p>
<ul>
<li>does not scale well at all</li>
<li>main loop is jammed with tons of code which causes lag</li>
<li>no object orientation</li>
<li>no packet validation (which is why it has so many dupes)</li>
<li>misuse of concurrent locks</li>
<li>some use task systems that run on their own dedicated thread which isn’t thread safe</li>
</ul>
<p>and so much more that by time you’re done fixing it, it’ll look like a half assed worse performing version of Runesource… so why not just use Runesource (or any other base for that matter) to begin with? doesn’t it seem illogical to waste time cleaning out a project insanity when you can DL another server and start working straight away?</p>

I use PI, and I use it a lot.<br>
The base is indeed written badly, there is a lot of dead code (Talking about the original), and you don’t even want to get me started on how many times Insanity called static methods in a non-static way. Sure, some things are easy to fix (esp. for the above-average users), but then you have things like the combat system (oh god the horrors), playersaving (not so much), all the extra code in client.java’s process method, etc. I could go on, really.</p>
<p>But that’s not all what is wrong with it. What’s wrong with it is that it was one of the more known “named” server/client packages. It was better to use then delta because of packaging and some other crap. It took the net by storm, and there were like 300 new servers up/day because of how easy it was to plug and play (What i mean is, is download it, change a name, and host). With this huge ass wave of servers coming up, there was one fatal flaw. 90% of the owners didn’t know 2-shits about java (tbh I was one of em at one point) so they threw in code they copy/pasted either from other parts of the server, the internet, or from some friend.</p>
<p>All they did was pile bad code onto more bad code, creating a pile of crap. Then eventually those kids finally decided to learn how to code, and started making better progress at cleaning up PI and making it better. But eventually they realize:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>by the time you get the server to it’s backbones - which is what needs to be improved first - you could have already written something much more efficient, and you can call it your own!</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s when you started seeing Hyperion, Rune Source, etc popping up.</p>
<p>Now, yet again, we’re at the stage where a bunch of servers are being released without much being done to them (this time it’s with 7XX because of matrix). Difference is the base code was overall written better than PI.</p>
<p>tl;dr: PI is not just shit because of the base code, it’s shit because of shit kids adding shit into it making it more shitty.</p>
