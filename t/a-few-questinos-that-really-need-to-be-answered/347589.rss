    <title>A few questinos that really need to be answered</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-questinos-that-really-need-to-be-answered/347589</link>
    <description>Alright guys I have a few quick (maybe not so quick questions)

Q1: How can I encrypt my client so that other people can&#39;t rip it, but they can sitll play it?

Q2: How can I add world maps to places like Ardougne and the Gnome village, and where do I get them from?

Q3: How can I clip firemaking? Its driving me crazy....

Any help would be really appreciated, should I post this in the client help section instead?

Thanks,</description>
