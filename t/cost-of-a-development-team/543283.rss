    <title>Cost of a development team?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cost-of-a-development-team/543283</link>
    <description>Sorry if this isn&#39;t the right place to ask but I have been searching a bit and can&#39;t seem to find an answer to my question.

I&#39;m looking to fund a game development not a runescape copyright or any other copyright I&#39;m just looking to completely have a new game developed. I&#39;m trying to get rough estimates on how much this could cost me. And if anyone knows were or how I would find a development team for this?

I have ran my very own rsps a few years ago and I enjoyed it a ton. Which is how I got the idea to save to have my own game developed.</description>

You need to provide something that inspires them to work for significantly less than they could get elsewhere, and you need to accept that they’d want to take ownership of the project as well as yourself. Based on your posts so far you don’t seem like that kind of person. These “self taught” programmers willing to work for less than a liveable wage simply do not exist.</p>

              <p>An entry-level developer’s market salary in Australia is typically $50k or higher. And as entry-level developers, they aren’t going to be super productive. Most people earning that kind of salary are fresh-faced and straight out of university.</p>
<p>A senior developer is probably $80k per year, if not higher. A graphic designer, probably $45k  - $55k per year.</p>
<p>What do you think you’ll get for $10k? That’s not even enough to furnish a small office environment for five workers (assuming $1500 per computer, and then other things like desks), let alone rent and salaries.</p>

              <p>Sorry if I’m coming off dumb but I’m new to this why do I need an android application I was just hoping to find a few people who know how to code and graphic designs ect. Or if I was lucky I could find like 2-4 people who can put my ideas together. Idk I was hoping for 10k-20k to just get the game started then obviously update and make the game better as the game grosses money.</p>

A polished android application can cost anywhere from $200k and up. Developing a non-trivial game would run into the millions.<br>

<p>Damn , that’s alot of money for such thing… Don’t you think?[/quote]</p>
<p>Not really. You would have more then 1 developer and you’ll also need to find people for graphics, music etc too. If anything 200k is budgeting.</p>
