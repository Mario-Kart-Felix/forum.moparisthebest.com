<p>[SIZE=“4”]<span class="bbcode-b">Welcome to LilwermScape V3!</span>[/SIZE]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Our aim:</span> Our aim is to achieve, not the biggest community, but the best community for a private server. We cannot do this without picking the finest staff first. Our staff may not be extremely active at this point in time, but once we start to build our wonderful community up, they will be more than happy to come entertain everyone during gameplay. This source is based on Ballscape source (credits at the bottom). Ballscape was a great server, though I am working my hardest to make this my own server, and implement my own features.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Membership:</span> We want people to actually stay and play, and not just log out after 5 minutes. We’ve set up a free membership feature where you have to have membership to use certain features/items. In order to gain membership, you must reach 100 combat level (with the exception of skillers and pures). Skillers and pures must talk to a staff member to get their membership.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Respected players:</span> We don’t have anything to offer to the respected players at this point in time, though I will be setting up loads of features for the people that I have loads of respect for. Respected players will be chosen by staff based on how loyal you are to the server/community.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain Items:</p>
<ul>

<li>Dragon platebody</li>
<li>Metal whips (Bronze - Dragon)</li>
<li>Abby whip (Strong)</li>
<li>PVP Armors (Distributed in Battle Grounds point shop)</li>

<li>And loads more…</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Economy:</span><br>
Good items such as: Bandos, Armadyl, Dragon, etc. will be dropped by npcs. Some of them will be in the shops somewhere, but if they are found in the shops, the price will increase dramatically.</p>
<p>All rares will be received only during certain occasions (Holiday events, drop parties, etc.). When you receive a rare, you are allowed to sell it for whatever price, to whomever you want.</p>
<p>Any duped rares that are found, will be deleted, and the dupee (Person who duped) will be punished by isolation.</p>
<p>Isolation punishment:<br>
When a player is isolated, they are unable to trade, drop, and stake. This is a new punishment and I hope to use it on anyone who violates the economic rules stated above.</p>
<p>The report abuse button works almost 100%, and I check all the abuse logs every day. Use it only if you need to. It sends a text file containing about 60 seconds of almost every action and also chat logs in the same file, so I will know when someone is or is not following the rules.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">We are working hard on building more membership features for you guys so that it will actually be worth getting. As these features come out, we will update the status page and the forums with these updates as well.</span></p>
<p>[COLOR=“Lime”]I got tired of switching music over youtube while playing, so I set up a shoutcast server for people to listen to while playing. I will also be doing chats with staff and players via skype and air them over the shoutcast. It could be used for server news as well.<br>
-The music list is small for now, but contains a variety of genres. Although you will hear lots of repeats, I am building the playlist as we go.[/COLOR]</p>

        <p>Just a few things…</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Membership:  Skillers and pures must talk to a staff member to get their membership.</p>
<p>Why not just make a system to automatically recognize these players, and give them their<br>
benefits? Staff members don’t need to be bothered with such things I.M.O.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Respected players: We don’t have anything to offer to the respected players at this point in time, though I will be setting up loads of features for the people that I have loads of respect for. Respected players will be chosen by staff based on how loyal you are to the server/community.</p>
<p>Why not let the community as a whole decide who respected players are? Staff members aren’t fit to make such choices, because players will always show respect, loyalty, and their best qualities to Staff. Why not setup a Loyalty system? Each day you log in consecutively day-by-day, you earn rewards. The rewards reset every 24 hours. For example, if someone were to log in for 1 week without missing a day, you could have it give them a rare or equipment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any duped rares that are found, will be deleted, and the dupee (Person who duped) will be punished by isolation.</p>
<p>This is silly, you shouldn’t even be talking about item duplication in an advertisement thread. Isolation will only make them dupe more, but to hurt your work; not for their gain.</p>
</li>

        <p>Well I wouldn’t consider this troll as much as constructive criticism. Thanks for your reply, but a few of the points you mentioned I don’t agree with.</p>
<p>Skillers needing to talk to staff is because we’re still trying to figure out requirements for skillers to get membership. When a staff member thinks that a skiller is well deserved of membership, he or she is the only one that has a command to make them member.</p>
<p>Why would the community choose the respected players? The community can suggest who can be respected players will be, but not everyone in the community is respected themselves. The staff can have a better view of who would be good for the position because I can trust my staff more than I can trust my community as a whole.</p>
<p>And for the dupes, any known dupes were pulled out. We even had people come online saying that it was easy to dupe, tried, but failed. If the major known dupes were possible, I would make restrictions on trade, stake, and drop until they are fixed. This is just saying that if someone were to somehow miraculously dupe, they would be isolated. The isolation punishment will be used for more than duping, as explained in the server rules.</p>
<p>And I’m talking to my head-moderator on skype and he says hi!</p>

        <p>[quote=“lilwermscape_ftw, post:3, topic:449949”]Well I wouldn’t consider this troll as much as constructive criticism. Thanks for your reply, but a few of the points you mentioned I don’t agree with.</p>
<p>Skillers needing to talk to staff is because we’re still trying to figure out requirements for skillers to get membership. When a staff member thinks that a skiller is well deserved of membership, he or she is the only one that has a command to make them member.</p>
<p>Why would the community choose the respected players? The community can suggest who can be respected players will be, but not everyone in the community is respected themselves. The staff can have a better view of who would be good for the position because I can trust my staff more than I can trust my community as a whole.</p>
<p>And for the dupes, any known dupes were pulled out. We even had people come online saying that it was easy to dupe, tried, but failed. If the major known dupes were possible, I would make restrictions on trade, stake, and drop until they are fixed. This is just saying that if someone were to somehow miraculously dupe, they would be isolated. The isolation punishment will be used for more than duping, as explained in the server rules.</p>

<p>I wasn’t trolling at all, I’m just trying to help you out here. Your community as a whole can be trusted MUCH more than a single Staff member to pick and choose who gets what. People will always play favorites.</p>
<p>Skillers won’t need to speak with Staff if the requirements are already set up.</p>
<p>Eventually people will find another way to duplicate items. I’m not sure who your head-moderator is, but tell him I said hi back.</p>

<p>Thanks man, and yes we are working on coming up with requirements for skiller membership. And as far as dupes, when I see it, I will try my hardest to remove them.</p>

</aside>
<p>Thanks, and yes. I don’t like anything 500+, but there are a few items that just needed to be added. I feel as if dragon claws, ags, vls, and pretty much all pvp armors play a huge role in my server because the demand for them on my server is extreme, and they’re all kinda rare. But when we start talking about newer graphics, gameframe, models (as a whole), maps, monsters, pretty much everything that RuneScape has done within the last few years, I don’t like any of it.</p>
<p>EDIT: BTW, Team_Rocket, if you’re still reading this, the requirements are different for skillers and mains, so how would I get my server to know what kind of account you are to see if you have the right requirements? I think it would be pointless to add an interface in the starter to choose if you are main or skiller, just to get membership later on down the line. And I don’t want to add a button saying “I’m a skiller, trust me!” because they might just want membership earlier than everyone else.</p>
