    <title>No CD crack for Rise and Fall: Civilizations at War?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/no-cd-crack-for-rise-and-fall-civilizations-at-war/7227</link>
    <description>I just downloaded a torrent of it, but I cannot find a no CD crack. I have searched Google, Gamecopyworld, and even read all the comments on a few torrent sites that have it available. None seem to have anything that will work.

Out of deperation, I even removed my DVD RW drive from my laptop, and mounted it wil Daemon tools to virual drive D:, yet it still doesn&#39;t work. I tried copying the .exe from the demo version (that works on some games), and even that didnt work. I would really appreciate it if someone could shine some light on the situation.</description>

              <p>Well… It uses Starforce 3.7 for the protection, which actually installs its own drivers. This one may be pretty hard to crack.</p>
<p>This is bugging me. I REALLY want this game, but I am broke and cannot afford it.</p>

              <p>i hate it when that happens.  I would say search google and torrents, but since youve done both of those, maybe nobodys ever made one (or made a public release of one) yet.  Its a nutbuster trying to find no cd cracks, i always end up pissed off when trying to find one <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
