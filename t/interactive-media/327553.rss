    <description>So I have a few options for some classes this year.
I want to take Interactive Media Senior year but I&#39;m not really sure about it. I think
I&#39;ve got some really good ideas to do but I have no talent in art at all. I think that a few programs are used
this year such as photoshop, adobe, etc. There&#39;s also a lot of work with animation which I like. So I just
wanted to ask if this might be good for a profession or if it&#39;s any fun at all.</description>
