[center]Hey! We are the guys from Outbreak-Gaming.net! 

Outbreak-Gaming is a non-profit gaming community which promises that our gaming servers will always be free and open to everyone and most importantly fun!! Our administration team puts in a lot of hard work into our servers and devote a lot of their free time into making sure that everyone is happy and that everyone is getting the most out of playing on our servers. 

We are here today to let you guys know that our Minecraft server is now back online and we are inviting you to play! Our server is a survival/pvp/light clan wars kind of server where building is encouraged and where we try to cater to a wide range of our player’s wishes when it comes to minecraft.

Some of our server&#39;s current features include:

Dedicated Host! - Online 24/7 with almost no downtime in 2 months.

Runs Bukkit! - We run bukkit and update regularly, we add any fun plugins we come across/that are suggested to us.

Multiple Worlds! - We have multiple worlds for you to explore and conquer! From and unlimited build world to the nether or into the floating islands of the skylands!

Pvp enabled! - Kill other players for the loot or steal from their strongholds chests!

50 Slot Server! - Loads of people to play with and against! Reserved slots for donators!

Economy! - Money and shops everywhere! Every item has a worth to others, players can make shops to sell their items.

Donator extras! – If you donate to our server we look after you and you get commands and features normal player don’t have access to.

Team up! – Party commands and chat make it easy to play with your friends, set up your own clan, get your own chat, turn of party pvp so you can’t hurt your friends and more!

We hope to see you on our server soon!
