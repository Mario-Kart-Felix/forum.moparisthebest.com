    <title>Firefighters film UFO in China</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/firefighters-film-ufo-in-china/258521</link>
    <description>It&#39;s scary how much it sounds like what I saw, except what I saw was a little more bright and definitely faster. Not just a sighting I&#39;ve had, one that almost the entire town of Waltham Quebec saw one night (where I was at the time..) 

I still think there&#39;s a logical explanation to everything. But it doesn&#39;t change the fact that it was still an unidentified flying object.

I would like to see the video when it comes out.</description>
