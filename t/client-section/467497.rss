If you’re trying to condense the boards, then why make a client and a server tutorial board? Combine them. I like both suggestions, however the only problem I have is with the ‘Featured Downloads’ section in Davidi’s post.

[/quote]Yes it was just an idea, but of course there would have to be work related to it to come up with featured downloads.</p>
<p>As for the tutorial sections, I had them split up because I think client development is a lot different than server development, and putting them together would have any ‘client tutorials’ be lost in the sea of server tutorials.[/quote]Make one section there a client tutorial forum and an “other” category.</p>

But for arguments sake say you had 11 forums boards, all pointed at different specific categories to do with RSPS. Advertisement, Help, Discussion, Show-Off, Tutorials, Downloads, Tools, Informative Threads, Snippets, Requests, Teams &amp; Configuration. Why have 11 boards such as that when you could have the following 5 boards:<br>
General Discussion(Discussion, Show-Off, Configuration, Informative Threads)<br>
Resources(Downloads, Tools, Requests)<br>
Projects with team requests as a sub-forum.<br>
Tutorials with snippets as a sub-forum.<br>
Advertisements<br>
Help<br>
[/quote]I was going to reply a while ago with my own setup but I lost the post and was too lazy to make it again.<br>
One thing for sure I wanted was to combine the downloads, having a ‘server and client’ downloads section, with a tools/data sub board (for things like drop lists and tools; but definitely not requests). I also like the idea of a show off board, we have people making ‘should I release this’ threads, and honestly I think it’s good people are proud of what they make, we just don’t have a place for it. But we do already have the project/teams sub board, so yea. I definitely hate the ‘configuration’ board idea.</p>
<h2>RuneScape Private Server Development</h2>
<p>General Server Discussion<br>
Downloads<br>
– Tools &amp; ??? (Idunno what to call it, ‘data’ sound bad)<br>
– Featured Downloads (new concept I just thought of, could talk about it?)<br>
Server Development (aka show off), or rename to projects and create a show off subsection<br>
– Development Teams (or recruitment)<br>

– Snippets<br>
– Customization (everything related to custom items and such)<br>
Server Tutorials<br>

– Informative &amp; Featured Tutorials<br>
Help</p>
<p>And then we’d just leave the advertisement board as is. Of course this is all just off the top of my head and could be changed around a bit[/quote]<br>
I generally like your layout that you have but I don’t know if you’ve made a mistake or if it’s deliberate. You’ve put the client related tutorials in the client development section and haven’t included server tutorials in the server development section. I think instead of holding the tutorials boards inside that we make a separate board for tutorials. For example:</p>
<p>Featured Tutorials<br>
– Server Tutorials<br>
– Client Tutorials<br>
– Snippets</p>
<p>I think that would look neater. Although I do like the idea of featured downloads, what would the criteria for having a featured download server? Would it be the frameworks as they were? Original RuneSource, original Delta and then room for massive modifications on the bases e.g Project Zeta evolving from Delta.</p>
<p>However, I do think that we all agree the way to boost the activity in the client section is to include the client section inside the RS2 Server Dev. category.</p>

              <p>As you know Ruby, the RSPS community is surrounded by a large group of idiots who lack the common sense to read stickied threads which contain information on what is allowed in the boad/sub-board. If we are going to slim it down and have expect someone to post in the right section and they just joined us, 99% chance its going to be in the wrong board. With the community as it is today, we as the more experienced group of members can’t get what they want just for the looks. We had to provide for those lacking common intelligence.</p>

              <p>But for arguments sake say you had 11 forums boards, all pointed at different specific categories to do with RSPS. Advertisement, Help, Discussion, Show-Off, Tutorials, Downloads, Tools, Informative Threads, Snippets, Requests, Teams &amp; Configuration. Why have 11 boards such as that when you could have the following 5 boards:<br>
General Discussion(Discussion, Show-Off, Configuration, Informative Threads)<br>
Resources(Downloads, Tools, Requests)<br>
Projects with team requests as a sub-forum.<br>
Tutorials with snippets as a sub-forum.<br>
Advertisements<br>
Help</p>

<p>Really? Around half of those boards aren’t needed. They could easily be merged together. There’s also no need for half of the categories to be separated.[/quote]Providing posters with extra places to post is good. You don’t want something like Delta where everything is handled in one class or in this case, one board. I think its good to provide boards for those who can’t figure it out.</p>

              <p>If the client and server sections weren’t split up I believe it’d be more active. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>RS2 Server Development<br>
– Server Help<br>
– Client Help<br>
– Tutorials (client and server sided)<br>
– Server Development<br>
— Development Teams<br>
– Server Downloads<br>
– General Server Discussion<br>
– RS Models<br>
– RS2 Client Hacking</li>
</ul>
<p>Or something along the lines of that layout, I believe that’ll boost the whole activity of the client boards especially since they’re closer to the more active boards.</p>
