<p>Can you describe your current rehabilitation system? Is there more to it then a few years in jail?[/quote]<br>
Actually, that’s an interesting question to put forward.<br>
The answer is more obvious when you talk about rehabilitation for drug offenders – they go into rehab which aims to get them off the substance by withdrawing them from it in a controlled environment.</p>
<p>I’ve never even given thought to how people would be rehabilitated for other offences though.</p>

<p>There are no pro-death penalty arguments that hold.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Except everyone currently does the death-penalty wrong.  It’s ridiculous to sentence someone to death, then pay for their care and appeals for usually 20+ years before putting them to death.  They should carry the sentence out directly after court, or at least no longer than a week later, then the cost would be far, far lower.</p>
<p>Cost isn’t why I believe in the death penalty though, it’s because there are some people in the world who simply can’t be rehabilitated and do nothing but pose a danger to their fellow man.  People who kill for fun, serial killers, pedophiles and such, they should all just be killed and this would be a much better world.<br>
[/quote]Yes, what a brilliant idea! While we’re at it, let’s kill those gay people too!</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Wow.  You know I believe that being gay is a choice, and I don’t agree with it.  But not even I would lump them in with and compare them to serial killers and pedophiles.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Why? You do realize that being a pedophile, just like being gay is not a choice right? What if someone is a pedophile but knows restraint, and does not violate any children? Does he still deserve to die?[/quote]</p>
<p>Again, I disagree with that.  Someone is not a pedophile unless they do something inappropriate to children, those are the people that I think should be put to death.  (mainly because they have something like a 90+% re-offender rate, basically guaranteeing that they will molest another kid if let out)</p>

<p>Wow.  You know I believe that being gay is a choice, and I don’t agree with it.  But not even I would lump them in with and compare them to serial killers and pedophiles.[/quote]</p>
<p>Why? You do realize that being a pedophile, just like being gay is not a choice right? What if someone is a pedophile but knows restraint, and does not violate any children? Does he still deserve to die?</p>

Our justice system is heavily leaned in the favor of the accused, and rightly so, since it means that almost never is the wrong person convicted.  We have all sorts of rules and laws for this, such as always assuming someone is innocent until proven guilty, and that 12 of their peers must find them guilty ‘beyond any reasonable doubt’ for them to be guilty, also the accused can never be tried twice for the same crime (double jeopardy), regardless of whether new evidence is found.</p>
<p>So yes, a conviction means you are guilty.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>So what about this guy then? He’s still guilty, even though he was found innocent?[/quote]</p>
<p>Once in a very long while, it’s statistically possible that someone will be wrongfully convicted.  But it doesn’t mean you should abolish a just punishment, just as you have a (much better) chance to die every time you leave your house, but you still leave it.</p>
<p>Also, this guy was exonerated with DNA evidence, which wasn’t available at the time he was convicted, so if his trial took place today he would never have been tried, let alone found guilty in the first place.  DNA just gives us more assurance that those found guilty are, in fact, guilty.</p>
