    <description>I&#39;m looking for 3 good programmers to develop RuneSource with me. Don&#39;t be fooled by my low post count and reputation, I just started this account because I don&#39;t use this forum often.

What I need from you: Conventions, clean-code, and dedication.

What I have to offer: 4 years of RSPS experience, conventions and clean code.

I can do full combat systems, skills, and the works. I expect you to have past experience doing those as well.

I&#39;m looking for the server to be new age with an old age feel. We&#39;ll all share the profits the server makes.

If you are interested please post some work you have done yourself.
