    <title>What source has the cleanest commands?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-source-has-the-cleanest-commands/86552</link>
    <description>[i]I know that there are some sources that say they only have certain commands, but when I look in the client.java, there are about 20 other commands.  Most of them are personalized with their friends names etc.[/i]

[b]Can somebody redirect me to a source that has only basic ban/kick ones but at the same time not all the pointless commands? [/b]

I just want a basic source that I can add stuff without having to remove stuff. 

Thanks,
