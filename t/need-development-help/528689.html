        <p>Hello Guys/Gals, to be honest i‚Äôm not sure that this post should even go in this thread but it seems like the best place for it. If this is the wrong place let me know and i will be sure to move it.

<p>I am very new to ‚ÄúCoding‚Äù or developing RSPS‚Äôs :palm:. I‚Äôm the type of person that kind of likes to try things first before asking for help. Believe me, i have done that, but to no prevail  :(, i need someone who has some type of experience that i can ask questions to if i have no clue what i am doing and they can help show me so that i know for the next time. I don‚Äôt really want someone to code my RSPS for me as much as i want someone to teach me how to code it. I guess you could say i‚Äôm looking for a mentor‚Ä¶ <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">   Anyhow if anyone of you are willing to help me with this it would be great and i‚Äôm sure quite an experience for the both of us. if you are willing to help please either comment, PM, or Skype me.  ;D</p>
<p>Also, i know some people like to have some type of look on the server, if you are interested it has 317 map data with 474 interfaces. If anyone would like even more information such as pictures or whatnot just ask ill do my best. (P.S. hope you dont mind Gyazo and tell me what you want pictures of‚Ä¶)</p>
