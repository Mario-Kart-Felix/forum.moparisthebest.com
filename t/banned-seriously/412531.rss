    <title>Banned? Seriously?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/banned-seriously/412531</link>
    <description>I got banned for having multiple accounts...All I did was see if I could change my moparcraft name and see if everything switched over, and it didn&#39;t so I changed my name back. It&#39;s not like I created a new forum name for it or something. My name I had originally was manbearpig, then I changed it to trollmachine because I kinda wanted to play incognito, but none of my stuff transferred over, and so I switched back to manbearpig. Was no intent of trying to cheat or anything. :&#39;(</description>
