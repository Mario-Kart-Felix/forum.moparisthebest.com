    <description>If im loading model definitions for say d claws from itemdef.java in client do i also need to hardcode the noted model? because i can not for the life of me get the noted model for my claws idk what it is im doing wrong... i have the definitions setup and everything but my d claws will not be in noted form the best i can do is get it to stack it just doesn&#39;t show as noted. Any ideas?
&lt;blockquote&gt;case 13699:
            itemDef.itemActions = new String[5];
            itemDef.itemActions[1] = &quot;Wield&quot;;
            itemDef.modelID = 13699;
            itemDef.maleEquip1 = 13698;//anInt165
            itemDef.femaleEquip1 = 13698;//anInt200
            itemDef.modelZoom = 789;
            itemDef.modelRotation1 = 240;
            itemDef.modelRotation2 = 60;
            itemDef.modelOffset1 = -1;
            itemDef.modelOffset2 = -23;
            itemDef.name = &quot;Dragon claws&quot;;
            itemDef.description = &quot;A set of fighting claws.&quot;.getBytes();
            break;
		case 13697:
            itemDef.modelID = 13699;
            itemDef.name = &quot;Dragon claws&quot;;
            itemDef.description = &quot;A set of fighting claws.&quot;.getBytes();
            break;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

13697 is the noted version and the above is the un-noted version in itemDef.java</description>
