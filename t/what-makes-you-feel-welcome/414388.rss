<p>My you do an emote and GFX and force text says “Im Back Guys!”<br>
Then a custom interface pops up telling several different information.<br>
Such as days of membership left: if your a donator or not then a donate button (i had too :/)<br>
a random tip and then what status your accounts in green yellow red depending on how many “black marks” or “warnings” you have. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> not the MOST original thing but pretty up there!</p>

Not too much crowded stuff so it’s not overwhelming. Rules list so I don’t get banned for something I didn’t no was against the rules. A few moderators in case I need to report any bugs to them. But make sure there’s a rule against bugging moderators over stupid stuff so that the moderators don’t quit. A nice beginner look so that I don’t look like some random guy who’s dressed up for a mexican festival. (not racist or anything im 8th mexican) <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Make a chill zone thats easy to get to and better than home for just chilling add 2-3 monsters there so that more people are attracted to there so that home isn’t super crowded and it doesn’t look overwhelming. Not to many things moving fast like a bunch portals going in circles super fast. Maybe one or 2 just for decoration. A really nice welcome message so they feel more comfortable playing the game.</p>

Thanks, what is your opinion on how long it should take to reach maximum level on a skill? Right now I’m working out the bugs but the max level for all skills is 125, I plan to have the skill cape stay at 99 but unlock something special at 125.<br>
[/quote]<br>
My little concept I had a while ago. And you get level 125 at like around 190m exp or so, so it is similar.</p>
<p>[quote=The Wanderer]First off this was concepted for a 317 server. When you reach 200,000,000 experience in a skill you would be given the opportunity at your will to teleport to the RuneScape’s God’s Temple and receive a God Cape of Accomplishment in said skill. You get to decide which god you receive it from, but it doesn’t matter. Each god is sitting in a throne. With these capes comes a new set of emotes and effects. Effects affect your gameplay whether you are wearing the cape or not.</p>
<p>Attack:<br>
Emote: Does two roundhouse kicks in succession and then jumps in the air. Your character seems to float there as he does multiple superman punches. Then he lands on his feet and it is over. Each kick/punch would have flames around them almost like they are breaking the sound barrier.<br>
Effect: Never ever hits a 0 with melee attacks.</p>
<p>Strength:<br>
Emote: Pick up a huge boulder and throws it/picks up the world and carries it on his back.<br>
Effect: 10% chance of hitting double your max hit.</p>
<p>Defence:<br>
Emote: Arrow flies at the character and the character simply catches it with both of his hands like praying and tosses it aside. A magic fireball is blasted at the character and he brushes it aside. A boulder is hurled and the character and he crosses his arms in front of his face and the boulder smashes to dust on impact.<br>
Effect: 25% chance of reducing a hit by half</p>
<p>Ranged:<br>
Emote: Shoots an arrow high up into the sky and as it comes down he shoots another arrow and break the arrow descending in half.<br>
Effect: Never hit a 0 with ranged weapons.</p>
<p>Magic:<br>
Emote: Shoots an air blast similar to air surge, then causes a mini wave to come from the side, then causes a huge pillar of Earth to rise from the ground, then a wall of fire surrounds the player.<br>
Effect: Half of runes are required for spells.</p>
<p>Prayer:<br>
Emote: Character clasps his hands together and bows his head, and a aura seems to envelop the character. A sword is swung at the player but is recoiled by the aura. Three arrows are shot at the player, but the aura acts as a shield and they clatter to the ground. A magic fireball is casted at the player and it seems to envelop the player, but the player is left unscathed because the aura acted as a shield. The player unclasps his hands and looks up. The aura seems to dissipate and a shadowy figure is seen above him, watching over him.<br>
Effects:1/2 of prayer points consumed while praying.</p>
<p>(I’m going to skip a few skills and put blanks later as typing on a small iPod with big fingers is annoying. I’ll only put the ones down I have emotes for now.)</p>
<p>Agility:<br>
Emote: Does a barrellroll and then does two back flips in one jump.<br>
Effect: unlimited running</p>
<p>Slayer:<br>
Emote: Tussels with a dark beast barehandedly, finally grabs it by the heand and slams it into the ground. Then the player places one foot on the dark beast like a captain Morgan pose.<br>
Effect: Requires no slayer equipment and slayer monster effects are useless.</p>
<p>That’s all of the skills I thought up while concepting this idea. Hopefully this will inspire one of you to finish what I never accomplished.[/quote][/quote]</p>
<p>I really like all your work bro <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

<p>Thanks, what is your opinion on how long it should take to reach maximum level on a skill? Right now I’m working out the bugs but the max level for all skills is 125, I plan to have the skill cape stay at 99 but unlock something special at 125.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>My little concept I had a while ago. And you get level 125 at like around 190m exp or so, so it is similar.</p>
<blockquote>First off this was concepted for a 317 server. When you reach 200,000,000 experience in a skill you would be given the opportunity at your will to teleport to the RuneScape's God's Temple and receive a God Cape of Accomplishment in said skill. You get to decide which god you receive it from, but it doesn't matter. Each god is sitting in a throne. With these capes comes a new set of emotes and effects. Effects affect your gameplay whether you are wearing the cape or not.
<p>Attack:<br>
Emote: Does two roundhouse kicks in succession and then jumps in the air. Your character seems to float there as he does multiple superman punches. Then he lands on his feet and it is over. Each kick/punch would have flames around them almost like they are breaking the sound barrier.<br>
Effect: Never ever hits a 0 with melee attacks.</p>
<p>Strength:<br>
Emote: Pick up a huge boulder and throws it/picks up the world and carries it on his back.<br>
Effect: 10% chance of hitting double your max hit.</p>
<p>Defence:<br>
Emote: Arrow flies at the character and the character simply catches it with both of his hands like praying and tosses it aside. A magic fireball is blasted at the character and he brushes it aside. A boulder is hurled and the character and he crosses his arms in front of his face and the boulder smashes to dust on impact.<br>
Effect: 25% chance of reducing a hit by half</p>
<p>Ranged:<br>
Emote: Shoots an arrow high up into the sky and as it comes down he shoots another arrow and break the arrow descending in half.<br>
Effect: Never hit a 0 with ranged weapons.</p>
<p>Magic:<br>
Emote: Shoots an air blast similar to air surge, then causes a mini wave to come from the side, then causes a huge pillar of Earth to rise from the ground, then a wall of fire surrounds the player.<br>
Effect: Half of runes are required for spells.</p>
<p>Prayer:<br>
Emote: Character clasps his hands together and bows his head, and a aura seems to envelop the character. A sword is swung at the player but is recoiled by the aura. Three arrows are shot at the player, but the aura acts as a shield and they clatter to the ground. A magic fireball is casted at the player and it seems to envelop the player, but the player is left unscathed because the aura acted as a shield. The player unclasps his hands and looks up. The aura seems to dissipate and a shadowy figure is seen above him, watching over him.<br>
Effects:1/2 of prayer points consumed while praying.</p>
<p>(I’m going to skip a few skills and put blanks later as typing on a small iPod with big fingers is annoying. I’ll only put the ones down I have emotes for now.)</p>
<p>Agility:<br>
Emote: Does a barrellroll and then does two back flips in one jump.<br>
Effect: unlimited running</p>
<p>Slayer:<br>
Emote: Tussels with a dark beast barehandedly, finally grabs it by the heand and slams it into the ground. Then the player places one foot on the dark beast like a captain Morgan pose.<br>
Effect: Requires no slayer equipment and slayer monster effects are useless.</p>
<p>That’s all of the skills I thought up while concepting this idea. Hopefully this will inspire one of you to finish what I never accomplished.</p>
