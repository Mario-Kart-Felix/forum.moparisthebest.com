    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-vps-looking-for-a-development-team-vps-317/337294</link>
    <description>I am looking to complete my development team. I am creating a server that I have high hopes for. This server is a Delta based 317. It is called Chromescape, you can google it although I am not allowed to post the link. This server is hosted on VPS 24/7. I am paying for it and do not plan on stopping paying it until the server shuts down/dies.

Please no flaming or immaturity, I am just trying to complete my team so I can make the game more fun for the people playing it.
