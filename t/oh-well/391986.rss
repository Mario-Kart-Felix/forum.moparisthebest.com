    <title>Oh well</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/oh-well/391986</link>
    <description>Okay, so my brother met this guy. It seems he&#39;s quitting. He gave away all of his items, including his bcp, tassets, 100M + in cash... &#39;doubled&#39; money, I gave him 5M he gave me 10M in return, someone gave him 20M he gave them 40M. Seems pretty legit, as if he was really quitting. So it turns out that he has a Santa, and so do I. He said he would double it today, and yesterday he gave out all of his items in front of my face. Easily 200M worth of items. Now I trust him a lot, so I thought he could double my Santa. I traded him, gave him my lovely 90M item, he logged out. This happened around 3:00. I&#39;m bummed. What do I do? :S. I hope this is the right place to put this.. I really just want to get my Santa hat back. The person&#39;s username is Deadly 1789. If you think I never had a Santa hat, please for the love of God stay the fuck out of my topic, I&#39;m not in the mood to get blown up by trolls saying I never had a hat. Fuck off.
Thanks.</description>

              <p>I think this fits with the new rule Silabsoft added. But no matter what, you NEVER trust a doubler. EVER.<br>
Even if ZEzima himself logs on and offers to double your bank or whatever, do not trust anyone with your valuables.</p>
