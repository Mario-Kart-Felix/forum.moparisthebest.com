    <description>Okay so i follow the steps here http://forum.ragezone.com/f368/tut-a-317-377-old-client-making-a-webclient-448998/

Didn&#39;t work... anyway to fix this?

my web client is at http://ksclient.co.cc

YES I DID FOLLOW THIS :

[quote=&quot;NaikBoi&quot;]Fixes:(if needed)

This should stop the connection problems.  The connection error &quot;Error connecting, retrying in 10 seconds, 20 seconds, ect.&quot; is just an error while connecting to the cache.  The easiest way to fix this is to get the client to look for the moparscape cache, because most people have this in their computer and it is always in the same place.

Step 1:
Open your signlink.java file. 
If you scoll about half way through the file (it could be different on yours) you should see the following line.

[code]

        String string_0_ = &quot;.file_store_32&quot;;
[/code]Change the .file_store_32 part to C:\WINDOWS\.mpr_file_store_32\

There is an alternative way to fix this.
If you have a line below that line that says
[code]

        String string_1_ = &quot;./cache/&quot;;
[/code]Then you can do it this way.
Make a directory called &quot;cache&quot; (without quotation warks) on your website.  Upload all the contents of any of the private server cache folders (like .mpr_file_store_32) to that folder.

PLEASE SCAN EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU UN-ZIP/RAR THEM!![/quote][br][br][size=1]
