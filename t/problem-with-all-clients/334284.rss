    <description>so i have this weird problem with ALL clients i try to run..
client&#39;s would run perfect, but once i get into gametime maybe about 1 minute in, the client will suddenly close out, i&#39;ve been trying to figure out this problem all day long..

any reason for this?
any fix?

-thanks.</description>
