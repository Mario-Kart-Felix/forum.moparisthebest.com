    <title>World 2</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/world-2/419735</link>
    <description>It&#39;s obvious we have some clashing in opinions on what exactly the rules for world 2 are. Instead of trying to punish people and running loops around the guidelines let&#39;s just settle it here and add/remove what we see fit. 

As far as I&#39;m concerned it&#39;s the same rules as W1, but some other staff disagree, so what rules should be changed for W2? Some of the changes I&#39;m aware people want is:


[ul][li]Looting to be bannable (consider as griefing)[/li][li]PVP off? (What happened to the plugin anyway :s)[/li][/ul]

[hr]

I&#39;d like to bring another thing up as well (may as well):

Why do we still even have World 1? No one uses it - it should be scrapped for a creative world! (Fat cookies put forward this idea btw). Then all creative people can have peace and fly in harmony.</description>

              <p>It’s not the looting that bothers me, it’s how this ‘world’ has already turned into a war zone when it’s intention was to try and get some cooperation between players… (with a bit of added drama at night) which is why I’m curious you turned PvP on instead of off when the plugin wasn’t available for use</p>

<p>As you can see, PvPTime only supports up to build 1060.</p>
<p>I created this ticket ages ago, it was accepted, but as far as I can tell, it was never worked on:</p>

<p>So if any of you want to find a plugin, write a plugin or find someone to write it, feel free, and let me know.</p>
<p>As far as rules, it should of course be the same as World 1.  Before we should make ‘looting’ against the rules, we should just make unlimited LWC, right?</p>

<p>You don’t understand what I’m saying. I’m not trying to say you didn’t support PvP at night, I’m trying to say that having PvP on all the time because we don’t have the plugin is ruining the world.</p>

<p>PS updated OP please read folks.</p>
<p>YOUR EDIT:</p>
<p>“trying” doesn’t mean banning folks or disabling PVP completely - I’m all for chest raiding being looked down upon and PVP at night but the complete removal of that from the server is not something I will support.</p>
<p>YOUR OTHER EDIT:</p>
<p>I then go on to say I support it at night, I’ve said this so many times now - I DO support PVP at night BUT do not want it disabled because the plugin is yet to work.</p>

              <p>Edited, not sure if you read that.</p>
<p>And I also voted for PvP at night, which is a lot different than PvP-whenever-you-want-because-they-possibly-annoyed-you-and-now-you-want-all-of-their-items, thought I’d probably vote for the plugin to make it so people don’t drop their items (so the other person can pick them up), but they still lose them (as if they were dropped in lava or something)</p>
<p>And look at the last bullet, that pretty much puts the nail in the coffin. We were trying to create a world a more natural game fear (all the baddies come at night OoooOoOoooHHhh) which is why we supported PvP at night, anything before that was shot down.</p>
<p>Answer me this: Why do we have the 1,000 border limit if we weren’t initial trying to create a more peaceful work with coexistence?</p>

              <p>[quote=“Tom_BETA, post:1, topic:412949”]something got a discussion going in regards to another world! Basically it’ll be a world which is (almost) pure vanilla. So:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Creeper explosions on (does block damage)[/li][li]No residence (bad plugin)[/li][li]A border limit (This is good! It means the world map can be updated a lot more, and there is a lot closer communities!)[/li][li]The staff will be active, because the server doesn’t suck![/li][li]<span class="bbcode-b">PVP disabled (no fighting!)</span>[/li][li]anti xray mod (no xraying!)[/li][li]Potential lwc locks (free locks!)[/li][li]<span class="bbcode-b">A close together community, where we can’t kill the shit out of each other, and one with active staff!</span>[/li][/ul][/quote]</p>
<p>Can we get some consistency here? The only reason I agreed to this world was because of that stuff, and now you guys just want to take it ALL away again? I was hoping for a little change in the server that I had lost interest in due to the hatred and bitterness that ran rampant throughout the player-base because of small trifles and quarrels, and now you can already see it happening in world 2.<br>
“He killed me!”<br>
“He started it!”<br>
“Oh yea? Well now my faction is going to kill you on sight!”<br>
“Haha stole your items!”</p>
<p>The only things that DID happen were the border limit and replacing resi with lwc, but why? Why bother with those if you’re changing the point of the world again?</p>
