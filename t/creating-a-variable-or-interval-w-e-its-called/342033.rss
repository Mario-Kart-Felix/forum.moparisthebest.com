    <title>Creating a variable or interval w.e. its called</title>

    <description>Okie dokie arti-choki,
you know how every acc has basic stuff such as a height level, energy, etc.
and some sources have a slot of assault points, pc points, cw points, etc.
How could i make it so that when ever a acc is created it has a slot such as
q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, etc.
so that when a player completes a quest the variable or number whatever can be
set to a number such as 2 and the player cannot re-do the quest, event etc.
here what i was thinking code wise
[code]
if(npcID == 28) &amp;&amp; q1 == 0){
sendframe(&quot;Ready to start the quest fuck head!?&quot;, 1234);
} else {
sendframe(&quot;Nice try cunt! You&#39;ve already complete this quest!&quot;);
toX = 6969;
toY = 6969;
sM(&quot;Go fuck your self now!&quot;);
}
BTW im an amateur coder but i could prefect this by looking at other peoples code&#39;s
im just too lazy to look atm.
[/code]
so if you could help me with this problem then you will make a clown happy.
BTW on one last note i had delta source omg i spent so much time
i made it fucking beast, added 2 minigames. fixed cw. shops, trainng, etc.
then i realized delta sux.. &gt;.&lt; anyways im looking for a new source
i used to play santaman.no-ip.org the good days :D rip winten and football12somenumbers here
anyways the point is thee the creators of devolutions!!! ahah i was thinking about using it as a new source but i know the coding is diferent so idk. BUT if you know a blank source &#39;id
love to have it but im not good enough to do combat stances and all that shit
so if specials, skills, comabts stances, doors that kinda shit is worked out then yea
you&#39;d make a clown wanna blow you. please comment with some info!
clowns forever!</description>
