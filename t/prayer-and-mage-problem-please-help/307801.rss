    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/prayer-and-mage-problem-please-help/307801</link>
    <description>i dont know if this is a client side but i got 3 problems
ok the first 2 problems are prayer related,
1st is solved
[s]1st) when i put any kind of prayer, my prayer doesnt decrease, i mean if u have 50 prayer and u put protect from mage, even for hours, u will keep 50 /50 prayer, doesnt decrease, how to make it decrease?[/s]

2st)if some1 smites u and u r skulled, and when u r out of pray (because of the smite) so when u get 0/99 prayer, u get an icon that looks like protectfrom mage and range together, how to remove that?.

now this problem is mage related:
3rd)mage with autocasting works, but if u didnt have staff, and u want to attack some1 ur lvl with mage (not auto casting) it says ur lvl is too high, move deeper, 
but even if he is the same lvl, and even if u both are at lvl 50, and u try to attack some1 ur lvl with mage it says the same, ur lvl is too high move deeper

please how to fix
