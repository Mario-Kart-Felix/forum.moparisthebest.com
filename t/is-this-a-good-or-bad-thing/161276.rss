    <title>Is this a Good or Bad Thing?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-this-a-good-or-bad-thing/161276</link>
    <description>Ok. This started a long time ago, I found out who my friend liked, and over myspace i told her that he cut himself, and i tell her something bad everyday. Now, i know that he never liked her and that he used her to covor up who he really liked b/c he knew i would screw it up for him. He had a girlfriend the whole time i told who he said he liked that he cut himself, and after 2 years today, she broke up with him and became emo, but me and my friends take all his sharp objects, today i but himself with a broken cd.  His girlfriend he had all along broke up with him b/c she thought he was cheating on him, and he wasn&#39;t. And i bug him about it everyday screaming her name in her ear, today he got suspended b/c he punched my in the mouth, and kicked my friend down the stairs b/c we were both screaming her name. Now He tells random people i want to do &#39;things&#39; to them. When he punched me in the lip, my braces cut open his nuckes. and i would have kicked his for 2 reasons, he is half my size(im 5&#39;9), and he has a arm cast. We are all 6th graders and everybody in this is in 6th grade. Is this bad or good?</description>

Your a fucking retard, 1. You you would not be in the hospital and 2. Yes i do have braces you dumbass.<br>

Yes he would, punching with a force as strong as that would mash your hands, seeing as braces are blunt. And no you dont, your in 6th grade, you still got your little baby teeth.[/quote]<br>
I didn’t have my baby teeth in 6th grade. I lost them early ( for a guy) but so could have him.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Cryme Time, post:1, topic:161276”]Ok. This started a long time ago, I found out who my friend liked, and over myspace i told her that he cut himself, and i tell her something bad everyday. Now, i know that he never liked her and that he used her to covor up who he really liked b/c he knew i would screw it up for him. He had a girlfriend the whole time i told who he said he liked that he cut himself, and after 2 years today, she broke up with him and became emo, but me and my friends take all his sharp objects, today i but himself with a broken cd.  His girlfriend he had all along broke up with him b/c she thought he was cheating on him, and he wasn’t. And i bug him about it everyday screaming her name in her ear, today he got suspended b/c he punched my in the mouth, and kicked my friend down the stairs b/c we were both screaming her name. Now He tells random people i want to do ‘things’ to them. When he punched me in the lip, my braces cut open his nuckes. and i would have kicked his for 2 reasons, he is half my size(im 5’9), and he has a arm cast. We are all 6th graders and everybody in this is in 6th grade. Is this bad or good?[/quote]Amg, he cuts him self with broken CDs</p>
