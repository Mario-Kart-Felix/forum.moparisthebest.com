Yesyesyes! That white island was where white knights were. You needed at least one 99 melee combat. Did not remember there being that many shops. Not sure if you have your old Skype still, but if you ever want help trying to make it an actual server, you know I’m in.[/quote]<br>
For what it’s worth, the server does look incredibly fun. If you needed or wanted me, you could have me too, Mr Chapman.</p>

<p>Bezza actually visits rserver from time to time. Stuie is there also (stumeo) as well as Afro and a few other players. Wasn’t there a portal that took you to an island to fight white knights?</p>
<p>Also, runecrafting was awesome in PkIsle. Only 1 altar and it was in the wild. Every 10 levels you made 2x more runes. I really want to host a just for fun server based around that.</p>

              <p>Single best thread in the past like 5 years. I miss the good old days… That server was one of the best. I wish Bezza had stuck around. I remember leading both KFN’s and Lasagne’s moderator applications. Both of those guys were great. And the fact that white armour was the best armour in game and required 99s to use it was the best XD.</p>
