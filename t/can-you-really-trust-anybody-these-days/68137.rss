    <title>Can you really trust anybody these days?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-you-really-trust-anybody-these-days/68137</link>
    <description>Trust - It is something that is very... shall we say.. sacred.. it&#39;s like your virginity.. Once you lose it, it never comes back to you. The lack of innocence is always there.

Can you really trust anybody anymore? There are only a hand full of people I can mention that I can/dp truly trust/respect. But all the liars, scammers, cheaters etc. They come on to you so.. truthful, so caring and you fall for it.

Notice, some of your &#39;Best&#39; friends will deceive you. They will (sometimes) take what&#39;s yours for them selves. You  understand, right?

It&#39;s sad how you can&#39;t trust anyone anymore...

Leave a wallet on a park bench and walk away for 5 minutes and when you come back guaranteed its gone no matter where you live and the chances of getting it back are slim.</p>

<p>My mum says the only person she trusts is me(she said that’s also pretty pathetic ;)).</p>
<p>I wouldn’t trust anyone with anything really important, my mum probably but then who wouldn’t trust someone they’ve known and loved all their lives?</p>

              <p>Back in september 06 i trusted nobody, after the closure of my very lovely school and loosing tonnes of friends in april, the school had finally re-opened, but with only 16 people in my year.<br>
I didnt trust anyone and spent most of my break with my head inbetween my knees at break on a bench near my playing field.<br>
Eventually after a month of that i began trusting people, i actually was having a good time.<br>
But oct 06 everything went wrong, got suspended because of failing a drugs test. (ive never done drugs). A week later i proved my innocents by having a proffesional hair drug test done in london for £90. The school invited me back, but didnt apologise and didnt even aknowledge what happened to me, i had lost my faith and trust in everything at that point.<br>
i stayed off school another 2 months and had a few home schooling sessions.<br>
After a while news came that my head master was being sacked for drug testing kids without parents permission.<br>
After i heard that news i wanted to go back. And another few months have passed now and my trust level is back at a great level, i just finished my school performance of guys and dolls yesterday and had an awesome time.</p>
<p>I just wrote that out to say that trust can be lost, but despite what is said in the first post here, it can eventually come back, no matter what.</p>
