    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/port-problem/508716</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve got some problems with the ports, we&#39;re kinda in war.
Alright
I tryed to Check if my Ports are open,
It says 43594/UDP is open, and 43594/TCP is filtered 
Dont tell me i portforwarded Wrong, I did already hosted a server about 3 weeks ago with atleast 10 players online no lagg.
So thats not the problem, thats what i think..

Already added rule&#39;s to firewall before
Tryed it with that static ip tool shit
