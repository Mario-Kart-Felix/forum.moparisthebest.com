              <p>oke lets start with this fact<br>
ure cmd.exe (look there for ure IPv4)<br>
oke, u did that and it was open.<br>
cmd.exe isn’t always keeping the same ip as IPV4,<br>
i had to change it a couple of times a week when i wanted to host. so start with that<br>
look into ure cmd for the ip to portforward again.</p>
<p>if u got any more trouble i’m willing to add u on skype and help u with it.<br>
