    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/owners-admins-still-lose-their-items-in-pking/291767</link>
    <description>Yeah, I was pking with some friends in my server, and I died. No big deal, I thought, until I saw I lost my stuff, even though I&#39;m the owner. How can I fix this?</description>

              <p>or you could make an exception in the pking area, where it says oh dear you died… you could do something like <code>else if(playerName.equalsIgnoreCase("name") { </code><br>
idk it would prolly be something like that… Idk… new coder… but have been tryin to get the hang of this crap… so…</p>
