    <title>Computer Drive Name&#39;s</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/computer-drive-names/408379</link>
    <description>Well recently I got a new laptop that I have been building up to be a just coding computer and so far I have put a decent amount of work into modifying windows xp to suit my need&#39;s but one thing I failed to notice is that when I installed xp in the first place (was preloaded with windows 7) I had changed the dive name from C to I. Now it&#39;s nothing major but it gets quite annoying when installers mainly install to the C drive, is there anyway to change this without completely re installing and formatting the drive back to C because doing so would lose about a weeks worth of edits and free lanced coding.</description>

go use linux its 100x better<br>

I have a desktop with more dedicated ram and a higher speed connection for linux that I use for higher level coding. This ones mainly for when I’m on the road or on flights when I just want to get some work done for either my company or working on firmware for my phone and the few apps I update on android market.</p>

<p>Well window’s seven may be visually pleasurable the way it is built is basically for social networking and gaming.

<p>OT I made a back up online of my files, had to re install due to the system file’s.[/quote] i wholly agree, but you can run xp inside of windows 7, cause xp is soooo damn laggy</p>

"Start Here:<br>
1). Start Menu<br>
2). Run<br>
3). type “control” (with out quotation marks)<br>
4). go to “Administrative Tools”<br>
5). go to “Computer Management”<br>
6). click the little “+” beside “Storage”<br>
7). click “Disk Management”<br>
8). if there is already a drive with the letter “c:” right click on it (in the top right window) and change it to some other arbitrary letter (it doesn’t matter which one really)<br>
9). Then right-click on the hard drive and change it to c:\</p>
<p>Now if this does not work follow these steps<br>
1). Go back into your control panel<br>
2). Click “System”<br>
3). go to the “Hardware Tab” (up top)<br>
4). Click “Device Manager” (about half way down window)<br>
5). Click the ‘+’ beside “Disk Drives”<br>
6). There should be your harddrive, right click it and go to “Uninstall”<br>
7). Click “ok” in the box that pops up, then restart</p>
<p>When it restarts it should automatically rename it to C:\ (it will automatically reinstall itself when you restart)"</p>
