    <title>Screen Blacks Out After 2 Secs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/screen-blacks-out-after-2-secs/360096</link>
    <description>I have an IBM lcd monitor that blocks out after 2 seconds. I have taken a few courses about Electronics and such, was thinking &quot;replace the capacitors&quot;. Well I ordered those, (same ones, 1000uF 10V), and got them in today. It still has not changed. Is there anything else that could be causing the problem? I am doing to re-check the solder connections for the new capacitors, but any suggestions would be nice.</description>

<p>How about giving us the model # and, holding off on taking apart that lcd just yet. What is it plugged into?</p>

</aside>
<p>Its not that I’m impatient, I just don’t want to pay someone to fix something, that either me or my aunt can fix. As for the model #, Its a IBM 6734-ABO. From what I hear, Its around $350 for an LCD Inverter, So please don’t go looking up the part, because I’m not doing that :P. My laptop, Was dual-screening with another screen of my friends, before he decided he wanted it back. Now that I am getting ready to order a new Desktop, I need to get my old LCD fixed. Atm, I was trying to plug it into the same laptop, to make sure it worked.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t testing the capacitors (or anything else for that matter) be better than just replacing stuff willy-nilly?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>They had signs of being bad anyways. Otherwise I would have tested them. Plus, For $3 (3 capacitors) I’m not going to worry. I have my aunt (electrical engineer) looking at it Sunday to make sure I didn’t solder something wrong.</p>
