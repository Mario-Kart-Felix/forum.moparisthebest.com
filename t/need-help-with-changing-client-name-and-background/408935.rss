    <title>Need help with changing client name and background!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-changing-client-name-and-background/408935</link>
    <description>Ok so i was researching on how to do this, and appearently i just go into the client files and find gui.java and type in the original server name which would be &#39;BrokenX&#39; but nothing appears, so i also tried doing that in client.java and i changed anything that was already BrokenX to mine which is Based World but still nothing changes. Please explain why? Or give me a different method of changing this.
As for the background i was told to just look for the image in a &#39;sprites&#39; folder, but i don&#39;t have a folder called sprites. All i have is a file that&#39;s a notepad file.
Here&#39;s pics of what i&#39;m trying to change if you don&#39;t understand:

              <p>You look in the sprites folder for the background image, if it’s not in there I cannot help you because, it will be in-coded into the main file.dat and you will need toms cache suite to change it you can find tut’s online for that.</p>
