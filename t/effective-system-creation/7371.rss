    <title>Effective System Creation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/effective-system-creation/7371</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve seen a few interesting directions and discussions about which way to go for developing an internal bot framework. There were even mentions of using BCEL. &quot;/golfclap&quot;.

By far and away the best approach I have come across would be the framework that modifies the game before it starts. Here is a quick rundown of the steps necessary to create your own system:

1. CYA
2. Load Up
3. CheckVersion
    3.1 Store CheckVersion Hash
    3.2 Search/Modify/Inject
    3.3 Validation
4. Start Game

The steps are simple, but then again, I have never seen them enumerated.

1. CYA - Cover Your... Butt.

The most effective way to do this is through a combination of SOCKS and making the appropriate HTTP calls. (Credit: pplsuqbawlz - He and I went round&#39; and round&#39; about this. I finally gave in and admitted that though the possibility is incredibly small, there is still a chance that they can use the lack of HTTP requests as a means of detecting your clients). It is not enough to just implement the HTTP signature requests. You really should use a list of SOCKS proxies. Reinventing the wheel is bad. Use this: [url=http://jsocks.sourceforge.net/]http://jsocks.sourceforge.net/[/url].

Doing these two things *properly* will ensure that your client looks exactly like a browser connection (on the surface that is). It is also important to note that IF you don&#39;t do this properly, you can get caught faster than you would using Aryan.

2. Load Up - Get the loader.

The new engine/loader was fun to break. Get to know how the new loader works. There are traps they put into the new loading mechanism that are not immediately apparent, and unless you know java classloading more than casually, you will get caught/flagged/noticed. One thing to keep in mind is that the UID is generated/accessed very early in the loading phase. I will emphasize this again: It is very important that you know intimately which classes are REALLY being loaded.. the consequences can be worse than soloing Azuregos.

3. CheckVersion - Check the version that you are working with.

This step happens so quickly with step 2 that they could almost/should almost be merged into one step. It&#39;s important that you do not search/modify/inject every time you load the client. This is a complete waste of time. Once you get the Loader, validate the version. There are a few ways to do this. One common way I&#39;ve seen is where someone actually looked in the loader.class&#39;s constant pool for the &quot;runescape.js5?crc=XXXXXXXXX&quot; or &quot;unpackclass.jar?crc=XXXXXXXXXX&quot;. Although I&#39;m loathe to even mention that approach, it is likely the fastest check you can make. Just make sure that you form your search to accomodate the changes they are likely to implement in order to thwart your search. ie &quot;runes&quot; + &quot;cape&quot; + &quot;?&quot; + &#39;c&#39; + &quot;rc=&quot; + &quot;XXXXXXX&quot; + &quot;XX&quot;. The more effective, yet slightly slower, way would be to SHA the loader and the game code and check that hash against your last pre-updated version.

3.1 Store CheckVersion Hash

Once you have found that your computed hash doesn&#39;t match up to what you were expecting, save the hash somewhere safe. At the end of the validation step, you will store it somewhere more permanent.

3.2 Search/Modify/Inject - Add your modifications

This is likely to be the time-consuming step. It is likely to take more than 80% of the load time. Using the method of your choice, find the hooks necessary and inject the code you need to access it all. I use BCEL only because the search is built into the API. Call me crazy, I don&#39;t reinvent wheels. I&#39;ve also toyed around with:

[ul][li]jclasslib [url=http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jclasslib/overview.html]http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jclasslib/overview.html[/url](beautiful.. had to write my own search API)[/li]
[li]ASM [url=http://asm.objectweb.org/]http://asm.objectweb.org/[/url](Another great bytecode api)[/li]
[li]I heard that pplsuqbawlz has written his own API for bytecode manipulation... I also heard that someone has spotted Elvis on every continent and that aliens want to take over the earth. Hey.. anything is possible. :) love ya long time P. but you exaggerate a touch... then again.. we all do.
[/li][/ul]

One more thing to remember is that there are the new added traps to various method invokations. Make absolutely sure you know exactly how and when events are fired in the normal course of execution. For example... some things happen an exact number of times no matter what you do. This makes completely bypassing a method to bypass a trap very unwise.

3.3 Validation - Check your changes.

This is where you verify that the changes you made are not going to get you into trouble. This would be a good place for some sanity checks. I would recommend keeping track of all of the hooks you must have in your system and while they are being injected/accessed/stored or whatever, determine if it was done successfully and set a flag. The AND value of these flags will determine if your update was successful. If any of them failed, report it in this step. (This is likely to be a fatal error.. so quitting the app would be a good idea too :P)

4. Start Game - Let the beast run.

If your system has made it this far, then you have a live framework for the loading of runtime bots into the game. Surely if you have come this far, starting up the game is incredibly trivial. (Don&#39;t forget your Context and your Stub)...</description>

<p>It’s also possible for me to reach New York City from Washington D.C. going through Australia. Some things, though possible, are not the most efficient. The issue that you state as the <span class="bbcode-i">only issue</span> is really the killing-blow. You won’t find any patterns using reflection alone. You will need some form of bytecode search in order to find what you want. And if you are already searching the bytecode, then it is trivial to inject/modify/remove. What do you have to gain by searching in bytecode but backing up and using reflection? You won’t be able to access non-static members anyway. The only way you could is if you injected code that provided access to the nonstatic object instances so that you could make reflection calls on them… which is dangerous anyway because of the method invokation checks they instituted.</p>
<p>So it is possible to use reflection but it’s like trying to use a fly swatter to stop a B52 bomber; it’s just not tough enough for the job.</p>
<p>Use a dark room, a cold beverage of your choosing, the bytecode library of your choice, and either eclipse or idea.</p>
<p>As far as tutorials go, write code, and BCELifer it. That’s what I did to learn how to use/leverage BCEL in my projects. You also could ask psb for his bytecode library. He would tell you that it really isn’t that hard to do. I don’t know personally because I’m lazy and don’t like reinventing wheels. I also don’t have time to learn the entire class-file structure byte-by-byte. I understand it on a high level but as far as taking the time to write a complete package to do it? Nope. I’m sure the guys that wrote BCEL are a little better at it than some punk kids or this old fart here.</p>

<p>reflection is also viable, the only issue is how to determine the patterns.  The patterns can be deterined thru the deobs or bcel</p>

<p>A couple questions’ answers will shed light on the issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you using a loader of your own design that seeks to hijack the normal loading process?<br>
1.a. Meaning… are you loading the applet in your own frame?</li>
<li>Are you absolutely positive that the classes you THINK are being loaded… are actually loaded at runtime?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you need more assistance, look me up on IM, I’ll help you there. As far as everyone else is concerned, there is plenty of information to get the system working by yourself. If you have a few more questions post them. I don’t think it helps anyone to just blatantly spew gems for everyone. Most of the fun of this is finding it on your own with limited help from the outside.</p>

              <p>I’ve seen a few interesting directions and discussions about which way to go for developing an internal bot framework. There were even mentions of using BCEL. “/golfclap”.</p>
<p>By far and away the best approach I have come across would be the framework that modifies the game before it starts. Here is a quick rundown of the steps necessary to create your own system:</p>
<ol>
<li>CYA</li>
<li>Load Up</li>
<li>CheckVersion<br>
3.1 Store CheckVersion Hash<br>
3.2 Search/Modify/Inject<br>
3.3 Validation</li>
<li>Start Game</li>
</ol>
<p>The steps are simple, but then again, I have never seen them enumerated.</p>
<ol>
<li>CYA - Cover Your… Butt.</li>
</ol>
<p>The most effective way to do this is through a combination of SOCKS and making the appropriate HTTP calls. (Credit: pplsuqbawlz - He and I went round’ and round’ about this. I finally gave in and admitted that though the possibility is incredibly small, there is still a chance that they can use the lack of HTTP requests as a means of detecting your clients). It is not enough to just implement the HTTP signature requests. You really should use a list of SOCKS proxies. Reinventing the wheel is bad. Use this: <a href="http://jsocks.sourceforge.net/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://jsocks.sourceforge.net/</a>.</p>
<p>Doing these two things <em>properly</em> will ensure that your client looks exactly like a browser connection (on the surface that is). It is also important to note that IF you don’t do this properly, you can get caught faster than you would using Aryan.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Load Up - Get the loader.</li>
</ol>
<p>The new engine/loader was fun to break. Get to know how the new loader works. There are traps they put into the new loading mechanism that are not immediately apparent, and unless you know java classloading more than casually, you will get caught/flagged/noticed. One thing to keep in mind is that the UID is generated/accessed very early in the loading phase. I will emphasize this again: It is very important that you know intimately which classes are REALLY being loaded… the consequences can be worse than soloing Azuregos.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>CheckVersion - Check the version that you are working with.</li>
</ol>
<p>This step happens so quickly with step 2 that they could almost/should almost be merged into one step. It’s important that you do not search/modify/inject every time you load the client. This is a complete waste of time. Once you get the Loader, validate the version. There are a few ways to do this. One common way I’ve seen is where someone actually looked in the loader.class’s constant pool for the “runescape.js5?crc=XXXXXXXXX” or “unpackclass.jar?crc=XXXXXXXXXX”. Although I’m loathe to even mention that approach, it is likely the fastest check you can make. Just make sure that you form your search to accomodate the changes they are likely to implement in order to thwart your search. ie “runes” + “cape” + “?” + ‘c’ + “rc=” + “XXXXXXX” + “XX”. The more effective, yet slightly slower, way would be to SHA the loader and the game code and check that hash against your last pre-updated version.</p>
<p>3.1 Store CheckVersion Hash</p>
<p>Once you have found that your computed hash doesn’t match up to what you were expecting, save the hash somewhere safe. At the end of the validation step, you will store it somewhere more permanent.</p>
<p>3.2 Search/Modify/Inject - Add your modifications</p>
<p>This is likely to be the time-consuming step. It is likely to take more than 80% of the load time. Using the method of your choice, find the hooks necessary and inject the code you need to access it all. I use BCEL only because the search is built into the API. Call me crazy, I don’t reinvent wheels. I’ve also toyed around with:</p>
<p>[ul][li]jclasslib <a href="http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jclasslib/overview.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jclasslib/overview.html</a>(beautiful… had to write my own search API)[/li]<br>
[li]ASM <a href="http://asm.objectweb.org/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://asm.objectweb.org/</a>(Another great bytecode api)[/li]<br>
[li]I heard that pplsuqbawlz has written his own API for bytecode manipulation… I also heard that someone has spotted Elvis on every continent and that aliens want to take over the earth. Hey… anything is possible. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> love ya long time P. but you exaggerate a touch… then again… we all do.<br>
[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>One more thing to remember is that there are the new added traps to various method invokations. Make absolutely sure you know exactly how and when events are fired in the normal course of execution. For example… some things happen an exact number of times no matter what you do. This makes completely bypassing a method to bypass a trap very unwise.</p>
<p>3.3 Validation - Check your changes.</p>
<p>This is where you verify that the changes you made are not going to get you into trouble. This would be a good place for some sanity checks. I would recommend keeping track of all of the hooks you must have in your system and while they are being injected/accessed/stored or whatever, determine if it was done successfully and set a flag. The AND value of these flags will determine if your update was successful. If any of them failed, report it in this step. (This is likely to be a fatal error… so quitting the app would be a good idea too :P)</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Start Game - Let the beast run.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your system has made it this far, then you have a live framework for the loading of runtime bots into the game. Surely if you have come this far, starting up the game is incredibly trivial. (Don’t forget your Context and your Stub)…</p>
