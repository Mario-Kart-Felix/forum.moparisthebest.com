[/b]Hello people of mopar  :) adrenaline is looking for some new developers!
We are currently working on a 317 pi. im not going to tell you everything
About our content because its on a need to know basis, and if i tell you id have to kill you..
Im kidding i wont literally kill you :D now lets get down to business shall we..

[size=10pt]Adrenaline is a friendly enviroment were you can be yourself.
Were not just a team, were friends trying to make rsps`s at its best
What were looking for in our developers is unique, imaginitive, mature developers!
Our server will be unique and fun, with TONS of quests, minigames, npc&#39;s, storylines and
Much much more in future updates! We want our players to feel the rush of &quot;adrenaline&quot; while they play!
Were not one of those servers were the staff doesnt communicate with its players, we want our players
To feel welcome, and feel they can trust us. So were looking for top developers that are up for the task 
To help us rise to the top[/size]

Who we need!
 skilled source developers! -- Must have recent work to show!
 skilled client developers! -- Must have recent work to show!
 skilled GFX designers! -- Must have unique work to show!
 skilled web develeopers! -- Must be professional!
