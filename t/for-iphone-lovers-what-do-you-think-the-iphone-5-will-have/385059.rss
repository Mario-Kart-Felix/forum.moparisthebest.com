    <description>Yea so what features do you think it will have.

I&#39;m guessing it will have the same processor as the iPad2 so a dual core yum.</description>

<p>They already have to meet some certain requirements (i’m not sure what they are), as not <em>everyone</em> who does it gets the marketplace - mostly the cheap, no-name manufacturers who pump out rubbish tablets. So that would just be a little extra on top of what they already have.</p>

<p>That, again, is the sole fault of the hardware manufacturer.  There is no reason a phone couldn’t ship with the ability to load any OS on it at will, rooted or not.</p>
<p>It’s just opinion, and everyone is entitled to their own, but I think a ‘consistent user experience and control’ is a bad thing because it doesn’t leave much room for innovation.  Who is to say what the best UI is?</p>

              <p>Oh, I do like certain Apple products and that is quite a thing to admit on a forum like this. But I’ll justify them and tell you why, I completely agree with many of the criticisms, like stupidly priced laptops, peripherals and their strange policies on the App store that have eased up, there is still some frustrations and it is annoying, but as a package I do enjoy iOS more.</p>
<p>I have been ready and willing to move to Android when I put that HTC Desire on my insurance, I had the choice to keep it, but I just didn’t like it as much as iOS. But me doing that was out of pressure from friends who all couldn’t accept that I genuinely do prefer it for real reasons and a bit of uncertainty myself, but after looking at other operating systems too, like Windows Phone 7 - which follows a few iOS-like philosophies but also allows different manufacturers to use the OS I do now know exactly what I like, and that is consistency in user experience and control.</p>
<p>On my phone that is, because it fits in with how I use it. I know people with iPhones that use their iOS device in such a way that it clearly doesn’t suit them, and an Android phone would - but I’m not one of them.</p>

              <p>Haha when I got my first Android phone, the whole reason I didn’t get into app developing is the reasons you stated.

<p>See it’s easy to see me as an Android fan boy, I am in fact just an Apple hater <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
Their business strategy, and the way they conduct themselves just boils my blood because it’s all about the money, and the vast majority of their fanboys think they’re all about the end user. Now don’t get me wrong, the same goes for all these money hungry corporations, but Google release literally everything employees create, whereas Apple cherry picks the best ideas it can exploit for shit loads of cash.</p>

<p>May I ask Thug-life, why do you dislike Android? (you said “ew”?)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t entirely dislike it. I think it has done great things for the mobile industry, but also done some bad. The good things, is offering a completely free operating system to all, which has got rid of all those horrible, hacked together Operating systems that hardware manufacturers shoved on their phones.</p>
<p>The bad, for me, is there is a lack of consistency across the platform. Android market a bit of a mess in comparison to the App store, revenue on the iOS app store is leagues above that on Android (<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/02/18/apple-maintains-lead-in-mobile-app-store-revenues-but-its-share/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.engadget.com/2011/02/18/apple-maintains-lead-in-mobile-app-store-revenues-but-its-share/</a> 82% vs 4.7%) which attracts professional developers (not just independent) which spend real money on creating good, consistent applications that fit with the iOS system and continue to support those applications.</p>
<p>Something I feel I can’t get half as well on my HTC Desire. I don’t hate Android, I love it as an idea, I think there needs to be some rules on the Android store, you can still keep your freedom, but maybe a little consistency wouldn’t hurt. Why I like iOS (and WP7) is for those reasons, as a user experience it is great and the app store is great, ignoring some of Apple’s silly policies.</p>
<p>[quote=“Mopman, post:33, topic:385059”]Calling it an unofficial route is disingenuous, imo.</p>
<p>In your IPhone case, the hardware manufacturer and software manufacturer are the same.</p>
<p>Somebody installing a newer android that their hardware manufacturer hasn’t pushed yet is no different IMO to getting an apple update, because its a software update… from the software manufacturer. You can’t compare them directly, because theyre different situations.[/quote]</p>
<p>But that is the problem, you’re not getting the software update from the hardware manufacturer OR the Software manufacturer. I don’t like that, not everyone wants Android to be this tinkerers platform, the HTC Desire I gave to my sister, for example, she doesn’t want to piss around rooting her phone and putting a new software update on it, she wants it pushed to her like it is on my iPhone or on her iPod touch.</p>
<p>As for Apple not wanting you to do it. But they can’t stop you from doing it, there is nothing they can do. Also, it isn’t as if all Android OEMs are all for rooting their phones either. Motorola purposely put some extra security in place in attempt to stop people doing it on their newer Droid phones, of course, people got around it. But they’re both entirely irrelevant.</p>

<p>I’m saying thug-life shouldn’t count hardware manufacturers not giving support as a negative for android (and then bitch at people who point out that you can go get it yourself), because getting it yourself is a perfectly valid route from the software manufacturers point of view. They’re not really comparable situations, because when you buy an android phone you buy a device running software from another vendor, rather than an all inclusive thing.</p>
<p>It’s kinda like saying the pc sucks because dell doesn’t push driver updates often enough, despite the fact you can go get them yourself (but its an unofficial route!)</p>

<p>I haven’t used Windows Phone 7 for more than 10 minutes, so can’t really comment. It seemed the same as the old Windows Phone but a little smoother. I presumed that was just the better hardware (a friend of a friends phone), if its truly better then fine but it still lacks all the best features (afaik) of the iPhone and Android.</p>

<p>More Android devices, more choice, larger variety of hardware (I’ve already said this…) Apple is always going to behind, even if they “pull the lead” for a few months, Apple can’t compete and beat all the other phone manufacturers in a hardware race. You can’t even have a hard keyboard if you want to.[/quote]</p>
<p>The variety argument is completely legit. I agree, that is where Android will always have the lead over Apple on that. As for the Microsoft part, you’re talking about old Microsoft mobile operating systems. Windows Phone 7 is a completely different system (better than Android, in my opinion) and Microsoft keep full control of the updates.</p>

<p>You can hack your Android phone, I can hack my iPhone to do the same, overclock the CPU and “run minimalistic applications”.</p>

</aside>
<p>Wait, rofl. So its ok for you to go through unofficial routes, yet you think they’re not available for iPhone? Besides the iPhone 3G is coming on to 3 years old, it is currently on the latest iOS firmware. Support has <em>only just been dropped</em>. The previous iPhone is still getting updated and still has support, the iPhone 4 will have the same support when a new one comes out.</p>
<p>Updates is not one you can win on. Not at all. I’m staggered you think there is a way to win on this part, because even when support is dropped (something you shouldn’t care about, because you get little from your manufacturers anyway in regards to software updates) you can hack on the latest firmware on to the iPhone too.</p>

<blockquote>Speaking of updates. You're on 2.2 Great. Oh wait, we're on 2.3 already with the 2.4 coming soon? When will you get that, officially? At least Apple (and Microsoft with Windows Phone 7) update their latest phones as soon as it is available. (The 3G has just had support dropped for it).</blockquote>
Officially isn't important on an open source OS. That's why it's so brilliant, what a silly argument.
<p>LOL@Microsoft updating, I used Windows phones for two years, and still maintain my dads. There was never a single OTA update, and downloadable ones came once every 2-3 years with very little support for older devices that hadn’t been released with the new version already on. Windows Phone is also just slow and generally horrible to use.</p>
<p>Apple is like the Call of Duty franchise with its updates and upgrades, which is why I’d never go near them.</p>
<p>Ignoring all those phone specs because using Android I can do this wonderful thing called OC, run minimalistic applications and generally get better performance out of my phone. Which you can’t on an iPhone. Also you know as well as I do, the hardware is important but if the software is shit it doesn’t mean jack (like running windows on a brand new PC then comparing it to a Linux install on the same system.) Apples software is written for illogical people who think aesthetically pleasing UIs are more important than functionality. Also, the amount of people who think that iOS is more functional is ridiculous.</p>
<blockquote>So yeah, really. The iPhone 4 is not behind at all. Apple's hardware inferiority on their iDevices has seemingly stopped now (they're slowly scrubbing away criticisms). So yeah, if you enjoy using Android (ew) and like living under this idea that you using hardware that is massively ahead of the latest iPhone (which you aren't), then so be it.</blockquote>
<p>More Android devices, more choice, larger variety of hardware (I’ve already said this…) Apple is always going to behind, even if they “pull the lead” for a few months, Apple can’t compete and beat all the other phone manufacturers in a hardware race. You can’t even have a hard keyboard if you want to.</p>
<p>May I ask Thug-life, why do you dislike Android? (you said “ew”?)</p>
