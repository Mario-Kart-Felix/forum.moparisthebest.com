    <title>(Game Development != Runescape) Where to Start?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/game-development-runescape-where-to-start/410432</link>
    <description>  Hey guys, for the past year and a half, I have been self-teaching myself Java Programming. I have read a couple books on it, and I&#39;m not quite familiar with the language.

  Private servers aren&#39;t my thing, to say the least. I want to get into Game development and very visual software. Java swing just isn&#39;t enough for me, I&#39;ve made simple games with Java swing, and I want to take it up a notch.

  So I ask you guys, do you know of websites, books, of any sort. That jump in Java Game Development? Obviously I have used Google and found a few, but I want to get your opinions on what you have found and what you find to be good/bad.</description>

<p>Ah yes, I’m very familiar with DGIJ. I’ve reworked with several copies of his software engine, eventually building my own with some elements very closely based on his book. Nevertheless, I would not recommend it because it teaches people how to build a software 3d engine, and does a terrible job at doing so. His engine is rather slow and there is little practical use nowadays for a software engine.</p>
<p>It’s great for learning purposes, but not really for game development. I’m definitely planning on posting my own software engine in the future on these boards, but as a mere learning exercise. If someone wants to make a serious 3d game in Java, I would recommend using JOGL or LWJGL for starters, and maybe even a 3d engine like Xith3D or JMonkeyEngine.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>But it is good for learning the aspects of game development going through what a game comprises of and what you need to know maybe not in the detail or complexity that others may desire. I havn’t reached the 3d section yet but I am going to be happy to get through it, what are your thoughts on the 2d section because even though it is small I am thoroughly enjoying it. so far. Also if I do end up having a few questions about 3d modelling would you mind answering at all? [/quote]</p>

<p>Edit: Yeah, I skimmed through the 2d sections again. They are pretty good for giving you a crash course into making a simple game using the Java2D architecture. I wouldn’t particularly recommend using Java2D, but many would argue there’s absolutely nothing wrong with it. It keeps your application entirely portable, and its speed is inconsiderable in a simple 2D game.</p>
<p>I do give it props for teaching the use of NIO for networking and multiplayer solutions, though. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Thanks, believe me, I’m very strict on “good, efficient, and readable/organized programming”. Thanks though, I probably need to look up more on advanced concepts.<br>

try and remember that game development isn’t just something you can fly straight in to, a good game developer usually knows a fair amount of maths as well as programming related things. i’d recommend you start off learning/reminding yourself of things like trigonometry as it’s basically essential to figuring out things like collision and distancing etc. teach yourself to use a good library for graphics and learn about software design and data structures (basic ones as well as sorting and (graph?) searching algorithms) it helps to learn about graphics too, ie. what an alpha level is, rotation algorithms, etc.</p>
<p>when you’re ready to move into 3D you’ll want to learn good amounts of linear algebra, calculus and even more comp-sci/programming things but with the latter it’s more a case of “you’ll learn it when you need it” rather than a bunch of prerequisites however knowing how matrices work and such is going to be a definite prerequisite in the 3D world.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks, what you just said was very helpful. I somewhat forgot about the Math part of game development, and not everything will be just a prerequisite inside a book. Thanks man.</p>

<p>Private servers aren’t my thing, to say the least. I want to get into Game development and very visual software. Java swing just isn’t enough for me, I’ve made simple games with Java swing, and I want to take it up a notch.</p>
<p>So I ask you guys, do you know of websites, books, of any sort. That jump in Java Game Development? Obviously I have used Google and found a few, but I want to get your opinions on what you have found and what you find to be good/bad.</p>
