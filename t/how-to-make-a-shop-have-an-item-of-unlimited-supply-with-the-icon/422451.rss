    <title>How to make a shop have an item of unlimited supply with the icon?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-a-shop-have-an-item-of-unlimited-supply-with-the-icon/422451</link>
    <description>Hey, Does anyone know how to make a shop have an item of unlimited supply with the icon? By icon I mean the unlimited icon I don&#39;t like the numbers as it doesn&#39;t look good in my opinion.

Thanks, Mr Rushed</description>
