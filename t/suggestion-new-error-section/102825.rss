    <description>i would make a suggestion cause the lots of errors that are posted here topics go faster back to later pages..
and ppl dont get the answers to the question and keep on posting them

would it be usfull to have another section where all the errors can be posted and with stickys of the most common erros such ass the 
100 errors and sultion how to find the errors?

this would result that people that have normal question without errors more change to get there answers</description>
