    <title>Client Error NEED HELP FAST PLEASE!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-error-need-help-fast-please/239424</link>
    <description>Well, i was trying to play on my server yesterday, i just installed JDK 6u7, and everything was running fine.
I try to run my client, and this pops up : &#39;JAVA&#39; IS NOT RECOGNIZED AS AN INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL COMMAND, PROGRAM, OR BATCH FILE. I have no idea what this means, my friend does all the coding, but his client was working fine for him, so i dont know what is wrong.
PLEASE message me on msn -- Kyle1067@comcast.net because moparscape doesnt load well for me, it takes like 5minutes to load. Or you can post here, thats ok.

please, help, lol i tried playing my server on silab, it didnt work out so well XD


thanks everyone,
