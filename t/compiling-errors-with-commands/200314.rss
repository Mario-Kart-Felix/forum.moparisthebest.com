    <title>Compiling errors with commands</title>

    <description>A few problems.

1. i added a few commands, such as &quot;::whip&quot; and &quot;::gmaul&quot; using the spawn command maker at rune locus. (i&#39;m not a java coder.. lol), and whenever i compile my server... i get this:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
client.java:12958: cannot find symbol
symbol  : variable command
location: class client
                if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;::whip&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 0) {
                    ^
client.java:12963: cannot find symbol
symbol  : variable command
location: class client
                if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;::gmaul&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 0) {
                    ^
stream.java:232: warning: [deprecation] getBytes(int,int,byte[],int) in java.lan
g.String has been deprecated
                s.getBytes(0, s.length(), buffer, currentOffset);
                 ^
2 errors
1 warning

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the 2 errors are what im primarily worried about, and the code i inserted for them looked something like this...:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;::gmaul&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 0) {
 addItem(4153, 5);
 sendMessage(&quot;&quot;);
}

and... for the whip...:

if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;::whip&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 0) {
 addItem(4152, 5);
 sendMessage(&quot;&quot;);
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The problem is also the fact that if i got this fixed, on my server console it would say something about not being able to find a specified path non existant on my computer and looking for a file that is there.. so if i could also be enlighted on how to change what path it searches for, i&#39;d appreciate it.

2.I personnaly enjoy the massable g maul special attack. So, i found someone with the code for a massable one, and have it saved to my desktop. Just wondering if anyone could tell me where i put the special code for the g maul.

Well, that about covers my errors..

I appreciate anyone that can help me with anything of this sort.

Thanks,
Void Knight.</description>
