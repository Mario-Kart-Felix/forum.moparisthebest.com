    <title>[Suggestion] Base Put On Topics [Suggestion]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/suggestion-base-put-on-topics-suggestion/362734</link>
    <description>Note: I do not know the official place for putting suggestions. Correct me please. 

Ok, I really hope this suggestion goes through. It will help alot of people on this forum.

My suggestion:
When making a topic in &quot;Server Help&quot;, &quot;Client Help&quot;, etc, there should be a place under the &quot;Subject&quot; box. It should be &quot;Base:&quot;. I am tired of people just putting &quot;HELP!&quot; as a topic, not putting if it is Delta, Project Insanity, Hyperion, etc. The base would be posted next to the subject in smaller letters. This could also go with server versions. Examples: 317, 474, 508, 525, 562, etc.</description>

              <p>the problem with the whole “base” idea is that virtually all the server are exactly the same. no such thing as a delta or a project insanity they are all just winterlove clones. as for the versioning. Unless its directly relating to a packet it should not be version specific. It should also be up the reader to distinguish if they can or cannot use a tutorial. if a tutorial calls a bunch of methods you don’t have chances are you can’t use it.</p>
