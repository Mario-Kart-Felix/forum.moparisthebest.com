Yes, what half of the people are here for. Lol

If you know a lot about Java Programming especially [PI] I&#39;d like you to talk with you if you&#39;re interested in programming for the server.

I&#39;m currently doing this as a hobby right now which means it could be long time before BETA could even come out, so I could use the help. Please post below if you&#39;re interested and I&#39;ll give you some contact information so we can speak. :)

I don&#39;t need the help but would love it so I can release this soon to be awesome server out to all of you![/CENTER][/I]</description>
