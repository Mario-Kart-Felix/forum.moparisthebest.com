    <title>Which client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-client/423961</link>
    <description>Hi guys. I&#39;ve decided to get into old school style rsps&#39;s (a little custom ones)

I found a source of this 317 server that has some customs like dgs&#39;s, etc: https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,354350.0.html

Now the client is deleted, I wanted to ask whether you guys can supply me with a suitable and functional client, and/or tell me if any 317 client will work.

The reason I&#39;m asking this is because the server has some customs in it, and I&#39;m not that certain if every 317 client works. 

Suggestions?</description>
