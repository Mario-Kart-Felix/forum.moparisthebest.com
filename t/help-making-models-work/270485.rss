    <description>Alright, i have an entire set of capes i have made for staff. I have .rar&#39;ed them because that is what all of my other models are. I converted them to .dat before i .rar&#39;ed them. They still dont work. I have the int correct. But when i use the pickup command it freezes my client and i hafto go into char files and take that item out of my inv before i can log back in. Why is this?? I have herd about gzip. Yet, i have no idea what that is. Nobody will tel me anything........</description>
