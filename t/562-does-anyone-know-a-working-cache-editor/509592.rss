    <title>[562] Does anyone know a working cache editor?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-does-anyone-know-a-working-cache-editor/509592</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve tried Dragonkk cache editor &amp; alexcacheeditor.

But they all have been release without compile or run batch files, so i had to create them myself. After i dont that, I run it and it had tuns of errors.

I tried fixing it but its just way too much to do. I am not a briliant java programmer. Has anyone used one that actually works? I just wanted to edit the logo .</description>
