    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-changing-stats-on-an-item/253091</link>
    <description>Ok, I know How to change the stats but I would like to know if there is a way to make a NO hit sheild?  So I Can give it to one of my  admins as a late christmas gift lol (he allways gets owned) ..  So is there any way to make make something so the player never dies?   IS that possible??  I know how to make a One hit weapon but I dont want that in this server. 

I am a noob So I am playing with other ppls servers codes, I realy dont know what is the best base or starter server yet, but I am learning...  Hopefully soon I can make my own server ^_^   Just so you know I do give credit to the correct people lol I dont like it when I dont get credit for something.  SO I allways give credit to the ppl that help!!!!


Any Help would be GREAT!!!

Thanks inadvanced for any help
