    <description>Hey I was just wondering, where do I place my I.P:Port for the client, Mopars client, provides an i.p slot, but most upto date clients, don&#39;t allow that and I assume it&#39;s someone where in the source files.. So where do I add my I.P for the client to know where to connect? 

Also another questions is, where does the client check if username and passwords are valid and how? Like with php it uses post methods, so like &quot; username=example&amp;password=example &quot; and then it sends a request, to auth.php, then auth.php checks user files to see if valid, so i assume java/the client does the same type of method just with different output, so where&#39;s the script that checks that and how does it to do?</description>

The user/pass is done a lot differently.</p>
<p>Somewhere in client.java there’s a string like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>These are all possible characters for the person to use when they’re typing in the client itself. I believe the actual user/pass fields don’t allow special characters.</p>
<p>When a player presses the login button on the client, that sends a ‘message’ (a packet) to the server and then the server makes sure that everything is all nice and tidy, and if so they can log in.</p>
<p>As for the IP, it’d really depend on what client/server you’re using. But most servers nowadays don’t need a IP, but the client does. It’d typically be in client.java, search for common names like “Serverip” “server” “ipaddress” and so on.</p>
