    <title>[Project] Artificial Bot/Human-Like</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-artificial-bot-human-like/538276</link>
    <description>I haven&#39;t done anything website-related in quite some time, so I&#39;m here again. I&#39;ve been working on this project for maybe a month solely so that I can retain some of my website development knowledge. Here is a quick run-over of some of my plans, and progress updates! Everyone loves progress updates.

Overall thought: As stated, this is for retaining website development knowledge, it&#39;s not a skill I&#39;d want to lose. Anyways, I&#39;ve been constructing a robot that combines various different online robots. This robot will learn about the user, it will almost be as if you&#39;re having a friend. The basics that the robot will be able to do for you:


[ol][li]Give movie and song suggestions.[/li]
[li]Mathematics, even to the extent of word problems.[/li]
[li]Spell check, it&#39;ll be a grammar-Nazi and correct you when you&#39;re talking to it. While maintaining conversation.[/li]
[li]Geography help, if you ask, it&#39;ll tell you where Germany is, what Germany is known for, everything you could need to write a paper.[/li]
[li]Learns what you like through context.[/li]
[li]Will tell you news and weather updates.[/li]
[li]If you tell it that you&#39;re going on vacation, it&#39;ll memorize the date and give you weather updates depending on where you are in the world.[/li]
[li]Science, you gotta love science.[/li]
[li]When you&#39;re in a bad mood, it&#39;ll tell you inspirational quotes.[/li][/ol]


This is just a very rough list, I&#39;ll add more eventually, here are some of the updates and progress.


[ul][li]Does basic mathematical equations.[/li]
[li]Progressed the mathematics portion to include word problems.[/li]
[li]Grabs movie information from IMDB.[/li]
[li]Grabs weather updates after reading current location.[/li]
[li]Corrects basic grammar problems, such as different forms of words (ex. Your, You&#39;re - Their, There, They&#39;re) also punctuation.[/li]
[li]Learns who your family members are (why the hell not add this feature?)[/li]
[li]Easter Egg: If you tell the bot to talk dirty to you, he/she will do so.[/li]
[li]Broken laptop screen or electronic? The bot will help instruct you how to fix it.[/li][/ul]


The local Apache install is on my local computer, so next time I&#39;m at home I&#39;ll take some pictures and code snippets. Let me know if you have any suggestions, or what you think of the project. Thanks!</description>

<p>I’ll be honest, I’m not always the greatest when it comes to completing work. A lot of my projects are just for more learning experience, and to try something new. I usually do the main things that are different and problem solve to do them. But with big projects, after you get the base done, everything else is just busy work of things I already know. I lack the motivation to complete a project, in all honesty. If I had a project listed on Moparscape and people really seemed interested in it, I would continue to work on it until it’s completed, so that I don’t let people down. Otherwise, it’s mostly just a learning process for me. In this case, it’s to retain some of my programming knowledge.</p>

<p>This project is far outside the scope of “web design”.  The web design part will actually be the EASIEST part.  If you want to implement even a quarter of what you wish to out of those two lists, you have a bit of way ahead of you.  Your understanding of advanced programming techniques will be tested.  Hell, you might as well be an employee at Google.  You’d be encapsulating a bunch of other websites together, into a robot that can “speak” it to/with you.</p>
<p>I do say, good luck.</p>

I could understand your argument if he was planning to profit off of this project, but he clearly said he was doing it to retain his knowledge, so I honestly don’t see why there would be any problem with this.</p>

              <p>I haven’t done anything website-related in quite some time, so I’m here again. I’ve been working on this project for maybe a month solely so that I can retain some of my website development knowledge. Here is a quick run-over of some of my plans, and progress updates! Everyone loves progress updates.</p>
<p>Overall thought: As stated, this is for retaining website development knowledge, it’s not a skill I’d want to lose. Anyways, I’ve been constructing a robot that combines various different online robots. This robot will learn about the user, it will almost be as if you’re having a friend. The basics that the robot will be able to do for you:</p>
<p>[ol][li]Give movie and song suggestions.[/li]<br>
[li]Mathematics, even to the extent of word problems.[/li]<br>
[li]Spell check, it’ll be a grammar-Nazi and correct you when you’re talking to it. While maintaining conversation.[/li]<br>
[li]Geography help, if you ask, it’ll tell you where Germany is, what Germany is known for, everything you could need to write a paper.[/li]<br>
[li]Learns what you like through context.[/li]<br>
[li]Will tell you news and weather updates.[/li]<br>
[li]If you tell it that you’re going on vacation, it’ll memorize the date and give you weather updates depending on where you are in the world.[/li]<br>
[li]Science, you gotta love science.[/li]<br>
[li]When you’re in a bad mood, it’ll tell you inspirational quotes.[/li][/ol]</p>
<p>This is just a very rough list, I’ll add more eventually, here are some of the updates and progress.</p>
<p>[ul][li]Does basic mathematical equations.[/li]<br>
[li]Progressed the mathematics portion to include word problems.[/li]<br>
[li]Grabs movie information from IMDB.[/li]<br>
[li]Grabs weather updates after reading current location.[/li]<br>
[li]Corrects basic grammar problems, such as different forms of words (ex. Your, You’re - Their, There, They’re) also punctuation.[/li]<br>
[li]Learns who your family members are (why the hell not add this feature?)[/li]<br>
[li]Easter Egg: If you tell the bot to talk dirty to you, he/she will do so.[/li]<br>
[li]Broken laptop screen or electronic? The bot will help instruct you how to fix it.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>The local Apache install is on my local computer, so next time I’m at home I’ll take some pictures and code snippets. Let me know if you have any suggestions, or what you think of the project. Thanks!</p>
