    <title>How to add a JFrame?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-add-a-jframe/398535</link>
    <description>I would like to add a JFrame to the bottom part of my client with a vote and forums button, I don&#39;t have EGUI or JFrame.java so I&#39;m guessing I have to start from scratch.

I don&#39;t really know any java (I do know some) I tried looking up a few tutorials about jframes but they didn&#39;t really help me at all due to my lack of knowledge =/

So if someone could help me out I would love that :)</description>
