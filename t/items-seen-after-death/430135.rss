    <title>Items seen after death</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/items-seen-after-death/430135</link>
    <description>Firstly the problem was in funpk items were dropped and anywhere else within the game map nothing was dropped when you died. This problem has been sorted but now if somebody is killed by a monster/pked the items never appear to other people you can just tele back and pick them up from the area where you died, even in the wilderness. Items being dropped just dissappear, not sure if this is linked to it :/ can anybody send me in the right direction where to look please, thanks in advanced :)</description>
