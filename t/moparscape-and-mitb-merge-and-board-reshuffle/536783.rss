    <title>MoparScape and MITB merge and board reshuffle</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparscape-and-mitb-merge-and-board-reshuffle/536783</link>
    <description>Hello. I propose a suggestion to merge the MoparScape forum with the Moparisthebest forum, for a few reasons.

Firstly, as I understand it, one of the main reasons that installing mods to our forum instances is due to the current link between the two, and if this is not the major reason for the inability to install mods then I would be happy to be enlightened about the subject. Merging the two into one board would remove all problems with installing any mods that were developed for the current SMF version. Any of a recent version would require a small amount of patchwork to be usable, but nothing major. Being able to add in modifications whenever needed is an obvious benefit and I can see no way in which the ability to add in modifications can be detrimental. For reference, there are 58 unresolved suggestions immediately prior to posting this, and of the resolved suggestions there is an 82% denial rate.

Secondly, the Moparisthebest forum is very inactive. Unfortunately, the &quot;Forum Statistics&quot; page is linked between the two sites, but we can see that there is an average of 1,536 posts per day, whilst in the past month Moparinthebest has received around 8 new posts. If we take a month as 31 days, Moparisthebest is receiving 0.02% of the total traffic across the two sites. A serious consideration must be made to decide whether or not it is worth having a worse site at MoparScape to prolong the survival of Moparisthebest - should 99.98% of usage be affected negatively in order to benefit the other 0.02%?

Thirdly, a large portion of Moparisthebest&#39;s discussion boards have been cloned on MoparScape anyway. Boards such as General Programming, Web Design and Development, Graphics, Reviews and Multimedia/Writing, Discussions and Debates, and General Discussion have all been brought from Moparisthebest because it was seen that the MoparScape community could benefit from having these boards. However this cloning could have accelerated the decline of Moparisthebest - with the boards they desire over here, why would people visit Moparisthebest if no one else does? Fewer people visit Moparisthebest and so in turn even fewer people visit. It is trapped in a vicious cycle of user decline because the site no longer has a way of attracting users. As the majority of boards already exist on here, and a large portion of people who still use Moparisthebest also use MoparScape (Yz85racer, Newty, Mopman, Pwnd) there would be no harm in merging the two - all &quot;recent&quot; discussions could be merged over actively and the rest could be archived.

Below, I have laid out a possible board structure that we could have following a merge. I also took the time to make a few other small changes to the structure, which people can discuss.

[ul][li]I moved the Community Suggestions category to the top of the General category in order to potentially attract some more attention from anyone thinking of suggesting something, and also to show importance.
The News section was added as a child to the General Discussion section.
Debates was moved into one section - any &quot;non intellectual&quot; debates should be regarded as Discussion and put in the General Discussion section (a non-intellectual debate is just a discussion)
Programming was moved into the General Category and became the parent of Game and Web Development.
Graphics was moved into the General Category and became the parent of the Models forum. Modelling is a type of graphical work, and the move will attract artists who aren&#39;t interested in RuneScape, boosting the popularity of the section.
The Reviews and Multimedia section was added to the General Category
The Technical section was added to the category, although I&#39;m unsure if there&#39;s really a use for this section.[/li]
[li]A new category called Gaming has been created
I do not feel that RS2007 deserves its own category outside of the RuneScape EOC section, although a child board would be more acceptable. Only 3.5% of the total posts in the two sections is in the RS2007 section, which I don&#39;t feel warrants a separate board. For that reason, RuneScape has become a parent category to RuneScape Guides (which will host EOC and 2007 guides, as there were only 9 in total) and also RS2007 Discussion.
MineCraft has been added to the Gaming section, and has become a parent of the MineCraft Tutorials board (renamed to Tutorials for obvious reasons)
The Other Games (Talk about other games here) board has been moved and renamed[/li]
[li]The RuneScape 2 Server Development section has remained unchanged.[/li]
[li]The RuneScape 2 Client Development has gained a few sections. It has a Client Help section, a Client Tutorials section (Featured Tutorials are not needed at present but may be needed in future) which holds a Snippets section, a Client Development section and a General Client Discussion sec tion. These changes should improve the speed of our work on the RS2 client.[/li]
[li]The RuneScape Classic section has been given a layout more like the others and has gained a distinct section for Help, Tutorials, Development and General Discussion. The Tutorials section will be parent to a Snippets section (again, Featured Tutorials could also be added) and the General Discussion section can be used to discuss both RSC servers and clients.[/li]
[li]The last big section will be the Server Advertising section, although this could be moved higher up (above Gaming possibly). It will store all advertising in one place for anyone looking for something to play. It will store RS2, RSC and MineCraft advertisements.[/li]
[li]The MoparCraft section will hold MoparCraft Discussion and Infraction Reports to give MoparCraft a distinct place for all its discussion.[/li]
[li]The MoparClassic section remains unchanged.[/li][/ul]


Please look at this with an open mind and just add a comment with anything you feel warrants further discussion.</description>

As for removing MITB and creating all the boards on MPSC, that’s not going to happen, Moparisthebest is completely against it.</p>

<p>This is actually pretty well thought out. I like it.</p>
<p>However I don’t know why we keep having this discussion, MITB isn’t for it and therefore it won’t happen unless his mind changes which I doubt it will.</p>

The ability to install mods would be an improvement because people could vote on posts within the RS2 development boards (in a Reddit kind of way), we could have the “thanks” system we’ve wanted, the “spoiler” system", thread prefixes and numerous other useful improvements. I think you have completely misunderstood all of the reasons I have stated for a merge - it was <span class="bbcode-b">not</span> to gain increased traffic from the users of <a href="http://mitb.com" rel="nofollow noopener">mitb.com</a></p>

<p>That would be like throwing a big brand name like Walmart or Amazon away and then giving it a new name that nobody associates with the brand. Why, you ask? Because it’s an unnecessary waste of time. The Moparscape name is fine as it is, there’s nothing for us to gain by changing the name to Moparisthebest from what I can see.</p>

<blockquote>We don't need rearrangements, we need new content. Spending 8 hours rearranging boards then doing it again doesn't get us any closer to a new active member. Absolute waste of time.</blockquote>First of all it would take all of an hour or two, and secondly, the only way that logic works is if the admins/staff team are like clocking in/out hours they spend working on the site. Even if we don't do the rearranging that doesn't mean they are going to use those 'working hours' to add new content, so it makes no sense to even make the comparison that for some reason spending time reorganizing the site somehow takes away time that could be used adding new content. Because we know how much free time Tom has, he just doesn't have the power to upload files (and other stuff, etc), which he doesn't need to do to rearrange the boards. 
tl;dr - Comparing rearranging boards to other additions or saying rearranging boards limits other changes being made seems silly to me and this topic should just be about which board changes should be made (if any)

I don’t understand why that’s irrelevant at all, it makes complete sense. If people put the time and effort into giving the site new content that attracts the new users rather than a board structure that does nothing but favour the current members then we’d have some progress. It’s actually hugely relevant.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>New members will become “current members”, your message makes it sound as though the new structure will only be available to members who have been here for a while. It will be available to everyone and it will make it easier for new members to find what they’re looking for by giving it a logical structure. I would say that it being easier to find content would probably attract new members.</p>
<p>But we mustn’t rely on content alone to attract people. Everyone on Rune-Server and RuneLocus knows about MoparScape and will download what they want and then leave (or just wait for it to be mirrored over there). We need to attract people by being the best site in general, not just by having the best content. An administration team with a complete, innate repulsion to change does not make us the best site. Like I said, 82% of suggestions that have been acted upon have been denied, and the majority of the ones accepted haven’t been added, months later. The resolved suggestions also only make up 46% of the total posted - a lot of them never receive a verdict from the staff and are just left.</p>
<p>I think that attempting to be the best website of our kind whilst the staff have no intention of taking any actions to improve it is a very futile pursuit.[/quote]</p>
<p>You’re completely right, but certain tools and help with certain aspects of development really does push us in the right direction, which is just about all we can do right now. Tom told me this morning that srt8 is pretty close to having their newest baby therefore it’s going to be a big toll on his activity (as small as that is) so all in all there’s not much we can do on the staff side of that.</p>
<p>David, I never said it was a bad idea; I’m only getting the fact over that, in my opinion, the time could be better spent doing things that could bring in a few new active users.</p>

If people put the time and effort into giving the site new content that attracts the new users rather than a board structure that does nothing but favour the current members then we’d have some progress. It’s actually hugely relevant.</p>

              <p>You’ve said it yourself, Moparisthebest is a busy man and a lot of the technical side of things is on his end. You know better than I do regarding things like this, so bringing that up is largely irrelevant.<br>
EDIT: I’d also like to point out that this topic is mainly one concerning board order. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Yes that’s what people want to see in a forum, a newly arranged board structure. Not any new content like tools or a source library or documentation that’s easily accessible and widely known.</p>
<p>A board rearrangement won’t change anything other than confuse everyone who uses MoparScape for the next two weeks. After that everyone will realise it and then 6 months down the line suggest a different one. We don’t need rearrangements, we need new content. Spending 8 hours rearranging boards then doing it again doesn’t get us any closer to a new active member. Absolute waste of time.</p>

<p>Can’t see that going through either, Taharok tried to rearrange the forums while he was still active as an administrator and it done pretty much sweet fuck all except confuse everyone for a few weeks. Board rearrangements probably won’t go through.</p>
