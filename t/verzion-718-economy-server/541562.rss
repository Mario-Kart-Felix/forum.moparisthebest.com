[code]
Verzion is a Runescape private server as my partner and I have been working on. Me as a coder, I&#39;m trying to make my players happy for my RSPS. Therefore, adding as many features into a Regular Player, so my players will not get bored while playing Verzion 718. My goal with this is to have a good RSPS experience. I hope that you will give me a chance by playing.[/code]
