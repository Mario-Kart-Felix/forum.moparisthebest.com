    <description>&quot;Today we have made an adjustment to rune essence mining due to players breaking rule 7 and rule 12, using macros to mine the rune essence and then sell it.

As you are probably aware we have various systems in place to detect people breaking rule 7 and ban them. These systems work very effectively at detecting people breaking this rule, and make macroing a really bad way to try and train a high level character.

The problem we are now solving is not a problem with our macro detection systems which are still working well, but rather a problem with banning being an ineffective punishment against abusers who only use very low level accounts, and who have no intention of ever playing the game properly.

Over the last few weeks we have banned literally hundreds of accounts a day for macroing at the rune essence mine. However the bans were ineffective as the abusers could just create more low level accounts that they didn&#39;t care about to mine more. We also track trades so we can ban the recipiant of the illegally obtained items, but the abusers in this case were swapping the runes for gp, and then selling the gp for real world money on auction sites. Of course the person buying the gp for real world money gets banned, because we track the money they received in an unbalanced trade to a macro account, but the seller doesn&#39;t care that their customers get banned shortly after, as they have their real world money by then.

The fundamental problem is that rune essence was one of the few areas of the game which could be used to generate a reasonable amount of RuneScape money on a &#39;throwaway&#39; low level free account. Normally to earn large amounts of money quickly you need to level up an account first, and then of course you care if it gets banned so our normal deterrent is effective. &quot;

I&#39;m glad Jagex finally realizes what cheaters have been doing for years (Make account - auto - trade to mule - sell for rl money). I&#39;m not sure if this was a wise move, though. Most human being are eager by nature and this kind of opportunity (making real life cash out of game) could be too much for a legal player and he/she might jump in the cheaters camp and start searching for macros.

Enough of BS, lets get to the point: Is it possible for Jagex to detect if the GP is autoed after the money has passed from person to person? Ofcourse, it is technically possible but does Jagex really trace the RS GP? I find it quite hard to believe and I&#39;d like to hear your opinions on it.</description>

              <p>im sure they can track but as mopar said it only flags high amounts however mopar i dont think killing yourself in the wild with high amounts of stuff will go unnoticed i dont think they moniter just high amounts of items in trades but rather accounts with high amounts of items the code was allready introduced in private servers by xerocheez</p>

<p>Anyways the client has a converter between the two UID and USERNAME... What if they just identify cheating accounts and put their UID on everything that passes through them. 1 long on an item doesnt take much data at all. And then you're banned.</p>

<p>Maybe stop using aryan, the intensive care unit of botting. (Thanks krichevskoy :laugh:) And stop heeding none of my advice, or krich's advice. I think you'd be rudely surprised.</p>

<p>What, that large trades for nothing are suspicious? Obvious much?<br>Anyway, if you don't have the initiative to launder your gp then I guess you'll just get caught. I imagine a massive bot-run network of characters trading small amounts of gp for newb items and eventually funnelling the full amount to the intended recipient (over the course of, say, two days to a week depending on the amount). Most people aren't that patient, but I'd love to write those scripts sometime, run it as a service...<br>Anyway, I've always assumed that there are tons of "rule-breaker" flags on your char data serverside, marking suspicious activity and such. Could easily be a "LARGE NULL TRADE" alert, and if your character has been marked for something else as well then you're screwed.</p>

<p>But for all we know, the client is just drawing the graphics, and as Andrew himself has once said (something like): "The client is about 10% of the code, server is 90%". </p>

<p>Could Jagex somehow mark the autoed money and after every trade the server would check if the gp is marked, and if a large amount os this marked money is being traded for nothing between the same IP, they would give you a free trip to the <span class="bbcode-b">ban</span>ana isle.<br>I doubt it but someone beyond my knowledge could probaly enlighten me if this is possible and do they actually do this.</p>

<p>No Jagex is blowing smoke up people's asses when they say they can "track dirty money" as they put it, obviously it would be easy to write some serverside code that detects a high amount of somthing (or money) being traded for nothing or a low amount of somthing, it could be done in 5 lines or less, If/when I start botting again the way I will trade will be undetectable, I will simply trade all of my botted goods to one bot account, then log in with my mule/main account (the bots will always be using a proxy) and kill the bot account with all my stuff on it out in the wildy, pick up my stuff and go home <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png?v=3" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

              <p>"Today we have made an adjustment to rune essence mining due to players breaking rule 7 and rule 12, using macros to mine the rune essence and then sell it.</p>

<p>As you are probably aware we have various systems in place to detect people breaking rule 7 and ban them. These systems work very effectively at detecting people breaking this rule, and make macroing a really bad way to try and train a high level character.</p>

<p>The problem we are now solving is not a problem with our macro detection systems which are still working well, but rather a problem with banning being an ineffective punishment against abusers who only use very low level accounts, and who have no intention of ever playing the game properly.</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks we have banned literally hundreds of accounts a day for macroing at the rune essence mine. However the bans were ineffective as the abusers could just create more low level accounts that they didn't care about to mine more. We also track trades so we can ban the recipiant of the illegally obtained items, but the abusers in this case were swapping the runes for gp, and then selling the gp for real world money on auction sites. Of course the person buying the gp for real world money gets banned, because we track the money they received in an unbalanced trade to a macro account, but the seller doesn't care that their customers get banned shortly after, as they have their real world money by then.</p>

<p>The fundamental problem is that rune essence was one of the few areas of the game which could be used to generate a reasonable amount of RuneScape money on a 'throwaway' low level free account. Normally to earn large amounts of money quickly you need to level up an account first, and then of course you care if it gets banned so our normal deterrent is effective.
