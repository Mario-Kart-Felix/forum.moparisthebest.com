    <description>Anyone seen; http://www.watchingfreemovieonline.com/player.html?red=13176  ?

And on another note just wanted to say; R.I.P all the people involved in 9/11 shouldn&#39;t of happend.
But what I don&#39;t understand is why would they want to comitt sucide because they thought they would get 72 virgins in heaven, pretty sad...

Edit; how did they get bombs and knifes through security?

discuss/watch (like i am now).</description>

<p>They are the heroes of 9/11 - the passengers killed fighting their hijackers. But a new book claims they were shot down by U.S. fighter jets...and that the whole story is a cynical cover-up</p>

<p>No. Flight 93 crashed 5 minutes before NEADS was even alerted that the aircraft was a hijack.</p>

              <p>Frell, way to listen to the government account of what happened, which may I add, completely contradicts eye witness accounts…  The people who live in Shanksville say they saw flight 93 crash, then moments later saw a military plane fly away from the scene, and 2 civilian planes following it.  When asked what military plane they saw, most of them identified it as the A10-Warthog.  Also note that the way the plane was described to crash is the same way a plane crashes when it gets its tail shot off.  Also look at the flight path of flight 93.  Shanksville was the last place it could have crashed/been shot down without debris landing in highly populated areas.  Honestly, if the government shot it down, they made the right choice.  The people on that plane we’re dead, no matter how anyone looks at it.</p>

<p>Oh and it wasn’t shot down, she (and her team that was taking off ~5 minutes after her) couldn’t find the plane and later that day they found out the passengers caused the plane to crash.</p>

<p>Some religions include their ideas as to how it was all created. That doesn’t mean a religion is defined BY the religions of today. You can’t say whoopdie do, Christianity has all these features and stuff, and if something else doesn’t have them, it isn’t a religion.</p>
