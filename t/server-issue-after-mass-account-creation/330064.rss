To keep it from happening you need to set a max amount of characters pr forum accunt or set a throttle inbetween creating ingame characters.<br>

He’s using EasyRSC.</p>
<p>Your options are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Only allow character registration via a website (and remove registration via the client).</li>
<li>Set a limit between character creation using their IP address to identify them.</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s been no public release yet to fix this issue but xEnt did it for BeyondRSC so maybe he will post what he did and how he fixed it.</p>
<p>If it was me, I’d personally use no. 1 as I’ve never liked automatic character creation. View the PHP code I posted in Server Development and edit it to allow people to create a character if it doesn’t exist and then completely remove the automatic creation from the client.[/quote]<br>
Yea personally i think no,1 is the best option, I have the same problem, But im looking for someone who is willing to code it for a small fee of $$, since i never expect ANYTHING free.</p>
