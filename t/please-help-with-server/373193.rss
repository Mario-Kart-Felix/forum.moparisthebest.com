    <description>[font=arial black][size=36pt]PLEASE TEAM VIEW I NEED HELP PLEASE[/size]
Ok i&#39;ve tried everything possible to make my server work and it just wont!

Ok i have JDK6u23 and i&#39;ve updated my Environment Variables to this:
CLASSPATH:[CODE]CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23\bin;%CLASSPATH%;[/CODE]
PATH:[CODE]C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23\bin[/CODE]

I did make a no-ip and and it is my &quot;.no-ip.org&quot; is checked on the No-Ip DUC.

I also have a Source and Client. My server will work on IP 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1 but thats useless!

Now Port Forwarding was the hardest part, idk if i did it right or not! I have a 2Wire 2701HG-B Router. Its from att&amp;t! I Will Post a Picture on what mine looks like!
