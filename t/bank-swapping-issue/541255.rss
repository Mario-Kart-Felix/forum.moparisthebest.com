    <title>Bank swapping issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bank-swapping-issue/541255</link>
    <description>Hello moparians.

I&#39;m stuck with a little problem.
When someone clicks swap in bank, they can swap any items.
Though, items can only be swapped until the 16th row in their bank.
After that, the swapping gets bugged and it just doesn&#39;t work anymore.

Does anyone have an idea on how to solve this?
Thanks for reading.</description>
