<p>If you have the model, you can’t just add the int’s + model and just be done.<br>
You need to do this after you added it.(Also to npc.cfg for stats)<br>
Just plain out loud say this, “addmodel (model id number)”</p>

<p>I’m honstly sorry, but I’m lost on the knife thing lol. . .<br>
I can find what file It’s in though if you want.<br>
Also It’d have something to do with a timer, anmation, and gfx, and hit rate.</p>
