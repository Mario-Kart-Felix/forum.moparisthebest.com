    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cannot-connect-to-server-on-localhost/416470</link>
    <description>Well i am a bit new to the coding process, but i am trying to code up and view what different codes do, i compile my server to go into the game and see what i have added with the codes, and tweak it, after compiling bother server and client i will run server wait about 1 minute and run the client, now it is a 659 client created by austin, ALL CREDITS TO AUSTIN for project dungeonfest! and the ip and port in Clientsettings.java are set as follows.

public static final String ip = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;;
	public static final int port = 43594

and even on local host i cannot connect to the server, the client&#39;s CMD is stating: Error.j5gaming.connect or somthing, i do not have portforwarded yet, someone please help me!

Thanks
Best regards,
