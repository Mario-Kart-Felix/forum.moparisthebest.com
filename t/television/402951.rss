    <description>Hi guys,

I recently made some money, about £800, I want to buy a new TV.

I have a few questions, is 3D TV worth it? been looking at panasonic

http://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/panasonic-viera-tx-p42vt20b-42-full-hd-plasma-3d-tv-08160381-pdt.html?srcid=867&amp;xtor=AL-89&amp;istCompanyId=bec25c7e-cbcd-460d-81d5-a25372d2e3d7&amp;istItemId=xwxiptlw&amp;istBid=t

do you have any opinions? I 100% want plasma for the refresh rates being 600hz opposed to lcd and led&#39;s which are pretty crap.

I could also spend £400 on a tv and invest the other £400.

heres a few i have seen

<p>Plasma’s in general are more power hungry than LCDs, regardless of their state. But it is dependant on the TV, some of the newer more expensive plasmas are very efficient.</p>

<p>im quite hungover at the moment so my posts probably dont come across as they should. i think i just dont understand how you think the image is made worse as i can clearly see when i turn 3d on it improves quality and gives the image depth, both in movies and games (only tested crysis2)</p>

The difference arises in the fact you dislike 3D based on current content, I like it based on what the technology (and the newer screens without the need for glasses)  have to offer.</p>
<p>So we both agree in regards to content, as in your previous post with numerous examples from current generation 3D, the only which we’ve both experience is Avatar and I don’t disagree with you, although I didn’t find it distracting - bare in mind we’ll both have seen it on different TVs.</p>

              <p>So now you’re backing off that only you are right and that no one else can possibly have an opinion? Because the only people who dislike it don’t know what it is like, right?</p>
<p>My eyes are fine, I see the effects perfectly fine too. I just don’t think it offers any meaningful improvement, it adds depth to the image, but it isn’t right. The depth is there, I see it. My main argument is that it counters the advantages of proper, high resolution content - which in my experience it does, I’ve seen Avatar in 3D and then seen it in HD on blu-ray, I preferred watching it on Blu-ray because the images were sharper and you’re not distracted from the colour and didn’t get any extra enjoyment out of watching it in 3D.</p>
<p>Same with the games I’ve played in 3D. Motorstorm: Apocalypse, it didn’t make it look any better, and in fact, because of how these games work - it lowers the resolution because it renders it twice to give you the 3D effect, I’ve played GT5 and Killzone 3 in 3D too - nothing. It serves as nothing but a distraction for me.</p>
<p>I’m perfectly fine with you enjoying it. I’m continuing this argument because you two dare insult me with the bullshit that either, I’m purposely disliking it because I don’t have a 3D TV thus invalidating my argument, or I’m sticking on the fact it has little compelling content, ignoring my other argument about the actual effects of it.</p>

<p>you are entitled to your own opinion, but i do disagree with you that it hinders quality because it definitely doesnt. one of my friends did not think it improved quality, but this is because he is blind in one eye so it doesnt work properly, maybe you should go to the doctors and check to make sure your eyes are OK because it does give depth to the image.</p>

It would be absolutely fantastic if it worked as you said it does, but it doesn’t. You’re fucking insane.</p>

<p>So no. What you said doesn’t apply to me at all. 3D is shit, because it doesn’t improve anything, it serves as nothing but a distraction. My point about the content is that it is yet another nail in the coffin, for me. I’m usually one of those early adopters, but with this, and I gave it so much time - it isn’t one I’ll jump on. Because it does nothing but dilute proper HD content. It is a fucking parasite on the industry at the moment.</p>

              <p>Yes, you dislike an emergent technology because no-one is yet to produce suitable content for it. So the problem is obviously the technology o_O</p>
<p>You dislike the 3D content, not the 3D. If people were capable of producing amazing films in 3D there wouldn’t be an issue, the problem is while it’s still a money grabber they’ll just produce none story-lined special effect packed films for it. However I fail to see how that’s different to any of the standard blockbuster films that have been released in recent years, such as Transformers.</p>
<p>People didn’t like DVD when there was no titles available on it, they stuck with VCR. They disliked BluRay and HDDVD for the same reasons. Android was slow to popularity because people said there wasn’t as many apps for it as iPhone, content takes time. For this reason I fail to see how your point are even relevant (they’re certainly relevant for the present but my post was addressing the technology and the future of it, if that wasn’t already abundantly clear)</p>

              <p>I don’t dislike it because i’m being non-conformist. I dislike it because there is seemingly no content at all that makes it worthwhile, I was at Eurogamer 2010 hoping to be converted on games after seeing different films and sports shows in 3D and not being anywhere near convinced.</p>
<p>The games didn’t convince me either, and much like the films and sports, the 3D just serves as a stupid distraction. I don’t mind wearing the glasses, I don’t get the fuss around that unless you wear glasses yourself, I don’t get headaches with it - it is just annoying and it doesn’t improve the picture quality at all, in fact much of the time it makes the picture look lower resolution than it should (Both active and passive).</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with the price, I’m happy to pay a fuckload for a TV and content, it has to do with the actual quality being less than satisfactory and that few content creators are actually understanding what to do with it.</p>

<p>It does, 3D is obviously better, as it better represents our normal vision. The TV certainly feels more “alive”. People who complain otherwise do so become they are non-conformist!</p>
<p>My parents got a Panasonic 3D, the picture is stunning. However I don’t think the price justifies it and I think that’s where people like Speljohan dislike it perhaps… for me also the glasses seem outdated for lack of a better word.</p>
<p>Ofcourse now patents have been made for 3D without glasses, once those are the standard in about 20 years looking back at current TV will probably feel weird as hell. My main concern is I hope that all the awesome movies don’t appear shit quality to me then. All the best movies are from years ago but if it’s like listening to shit quality MP3 when I could have FLAC… I suppose my major concern is filmmakers these days are shit and as such 3D movies are.</p>
