    <title>Why not change the looks of clients?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-not-change-the-looks-of-clients/233600</link>
    <description>[b]Hello.  My name is starwarsfz and i&#39;m here to bring up a few questions![/b]

Why do all the clients use the same old login gray box?

Why not change it up and design your own?  Or do you have to use that?  I know i&#39;ve seen people change the background but never the login box.  

I am intrested in designing my own client graphics but i can&#39;t code for nothin but i want to make skins for people to download and use for there client.  is that a good idea or not?Okay thats all.  I know it&#39;s short but it&#39;s what i need to ask to see if its possible because i want to make custom skins.  It would look like this but better this is just a crapy example! [IMG]http://i214.photobucket.com/albums/cc172/starwarsfz/skin-1.gif[/img] By the way I don&#39;t know if that is a real ip address.

P.S. If this is in the wrong spot may a mod please move it.  Or if it go&#39;s nowhere then lock it, i don&#39;t want to break any rules.

Also I do want to learn how to code my own client so if anyone knows a link that can help me in that, that would be just Great![br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 28, 2008, 08:38:08 pm[/size][hr]Any one?</description>
