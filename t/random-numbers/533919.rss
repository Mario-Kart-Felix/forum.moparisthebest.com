    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/random-numbers/533919</link>
    <description>is there a way to get all the numbers (5 in total on to a list?)
starting with 4
like
48283
42823
49999
(all starting with 4)
how do you get all of them on to one list
(its going to be a million or more but I don&#39;t care)</description>

              <p>I come more from the angle that a veteran Java programmer will make novice mistakes when working with direct memory in a low-level language. It’s rather unfortunate, too, seeing as being able to understand how the operating system and memory work is paramount to being a good computer scientist. Those are often left out or heavily hidden from Java (and other managed languages) programmers.</p>
<p>I would recommend learning C before C++, seeing as C++ is derived from it. Bad practices coming from learning from bad programmers. You can learn bad practices when learning any language; C and C++ are no exception (and may even be the prime example).</p>

And really, saying you have a Java certification qualifies you of little in my book. I’ve seen and done some of those certification tests, they really are not worth bragging about, sorry. I commend you for taking your Java education to the next level, but Java is not a particularly difficult language. If anything, achieving that certification means you should be moving onto more difficult languages and trying to master them now. You would be amazed at how much better of a Java programmer you would become if you try to apply concepts learned from other languages to it.<br>

I’ve been working on C++ – it’s basically identical in terms of concepts to Java, though there are a few advantages. Thanks though.[/quote]</p>

<p>It’s nothing close to Java. There mere differences between C++ and Java is a featureset larger than the entire Java language. But very good that you are learning it.

<p>although you need to be aware that learning C and C++ concurrently can result in headaches and bad practices. heh…</p>
<p>i wouldn’t say that Java programmers suck at memory management insomuch as they simply aren’t exposed to it unless they’re <span class="bbcode-s">lucky</span> unlucky and, along the line, encounter something from the (fortunately quite small) set of memory problems. unless you’re saying that Java programmers tend to suck at mem management in C/C++, idk, i’ve found a lot of C/C++ newbies tend to overemphasize the memory management (<span class="bbcode-i">free(a); free(a);</span> lol) and fall-short elsewhere.</p>

<p>That’s a good one to read for any aspiring Java experts.</p>
<p>Honestly, all I have to comment about all these solutions is: try doing it in C, then port it over to Java. If you use a lot of low-level programming, you reach a point where you start to really appreciate the easy concatenation or string ops that Java has–so much so that you learn how to not depend on them. In C, you are forced to do things in a more direct way without using tons of memory allocations, etc.</p>

<p>random(4, 5) should give you exactly what you’re asking.</p>

Problem being I did not teach him nor advocate bad programming practices, I simply gave him a solution to work off of. NEVER did I state that he should copy and paste it, it was actually much more like pseudo-code with the intended purposes; however, it gives him some insight into how to do some different aspects of the problem. Again, if you have a problem with that, that’s your fucking problem, not mine nor his</p>
