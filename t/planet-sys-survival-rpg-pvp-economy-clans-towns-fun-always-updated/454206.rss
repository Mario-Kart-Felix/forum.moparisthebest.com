    <description>Whoaaa! 
After a while of waiting, it is finally here! 


Welcome to an unstable planet with unstable atmospheric storms that lurk around every corner. The planet is in fallout. All the remaining survivors form different guilds, fighting with desperation for natural resources with unlimited amount of resources to survive. Some prevail, some constantly fail.
The gods and creators are beings that can take your thoughts into creations with the uniqueness of love, wisdom, knowledge, passion, and of course,b!tches. loll, but yeah. 
Lets play Planet Sys. Join the game and become a victim of this world of thought.

IP Address = planetsys.no-ip.org
You&#39;ll be in handcuffs until you understand the world.
Once the loyalty comes, you&#39;ll be released.


Lol yeah, its a fresh server that is growing fast. Use your imagination. If there&#39;s something you&#39;d like to add to the server, speak freely and we&#39;ll see what we could do. We just ask that you follow the rules and forreal, enjoy your time!
