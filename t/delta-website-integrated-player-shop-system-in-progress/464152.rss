    <description>I was thinking of some cool projects I could do that no one else has tried before, so I thought of something great. Most servers have the standard player shops where you right click someone and click &#39;View Shop&#39;. I&#39;m doing something like that except players talk to an NPC and give the NPC items to add the the, &#39;Auction House&#39;, the player says a price for the item, and whether or not to have it just a buy for a set price, or people to auction for it. Currently I have it displaying a players inventory on the site, with images, it&#39;s real time and updates instantly. Below is a video showing the process..
[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyJy1afgZGI[/youtube]

I&#39;m going to change this later on to read the information from what the user is selling, upon someone purchasing it on the site, it takes money from the buyers inventory, and sends it to the sellers inventory, then gives the buyer their item they have purchases, if there were no problems with the transaction. Most of the stuff is going to be done website sided with Javascript/PHP/SQL, just recently I&#39;ve added switching between Item IDs and Images (for my personal debugging purposes), and grouping. So in the shop you can choose to shop by type, say you select runes (show in the picture below) it&#39;ll get all of the runes for sale and display them to you with options to purchase and compare prices, etc.

Update Log:
[code]
- Have Inventory save to Database.
- Have Player Inventories viewable with inventory.php?username=USERNAME.
- Added over 2000 item images and coordinated them.
- Created Item information, and ItemID will pull the item image, name, requirements, etc.
- Worked out the basic functioning of the shopping system.
- Created item categories and grouping.
[/code]

Coming Soon:
[code]
- Actual shopping on the website system.
- Auctioning items.
- &quot;Store&quot; pages on the site, players join a store that can be justified to one category of item selling.
- Integration with SMF and Vbulletin forums (view someones shop on their profile)
- Searching through items efficiently.
- Tons of other nice features.
[/code]

You all can help by letting me know what you think, and providing suggestions if any come to mind. I&#39;m going a bit slower paced as I&#39;m still learning some Java and not fully advanced with it as I am with PHP. Let me know if you have suggestions on ways I could improve the development of this system. - The Web Guy

<p>I linked a currency system with my forums to my game before and people loved that so I’m sure they’ll love this <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> more or less the more they posted the more money they got ingame (the economy was shit, it was a 667). The forums were dead and I had to get them active somehow.
