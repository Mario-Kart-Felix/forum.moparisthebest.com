    <title>Hybrid pvp Problem with Player vs. players</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hybrid-pvp-problem-with-player-vs-players/450422</link>
    <description>When i tryed to pk some other player i was using range and he was using meele. I didnt do damage to him but he did damage to me? Its the same for mage. If a player has mage and the other has range they both dont deal any damage to eachother. But it works when a player has mage and the other player is using meele. And in the cmd prompt for run it says when i use range and mage against players.

As Team_Rocket stated you should look at your delays. Also make sure to look at your combat methods. Like the way you say it I think there’s a problem with your ranging. You should take a look at the methods that handles ranging.</p>
