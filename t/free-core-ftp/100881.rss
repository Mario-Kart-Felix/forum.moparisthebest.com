    <title>Free Core FTP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/free-core-ftp/100881</link>
    <description>Hello girls (and guys),
I want to share a program that i always use to upload/download files to/from the internet. The program is called Core FTP.

Core FTP is a professional FTP (File Transfer Protocol) program.

Now, i want you to share the experience with me. So i am giving away serials for free. I will pay for them myself. I am not using a Keymaker (Or whatever those program things are called) or anything like that. Just a pure pay.

In order for me to pay to get the serial for you. You&#39;ll need to download Core FTP Pro Trial version from the official website. I suggest to use [url=http://www.google.com.au/]Google[/url] to search for it.

Now, you&#39;ll need to fill out this form and post it in a reply:[code]First Name:
Surname:
Core FTP Version:[/code]

You do not have to use your real first name or real surname. It is just required in the payment.

When the payment process is complete, you will receive a PM from me. It has the serial and identification information. The steps to install the serial will be in the PM too.

[b]NOTE:[/b] You will not receive your serial straight away. The payment takes a while to be processed, when i get the e-mail with the serial, then you&#39;ll receive a PM.

This is not a lie.
Enjoy :).
