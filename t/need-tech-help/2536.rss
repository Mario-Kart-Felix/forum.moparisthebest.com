    <description>Well I have two computes. One in my fathers room and one in mine. He connected to the internet usinga [i]Artion[/i]tec USB/Ethernet DSL Modem to connect to the internet. And I connected to that modem using a Wireless-G 2.4 Ghz Broadband Router(54Mbps)(Linksys). Now I&#39;ve recently switched to a Comcast Motorola SB4100 [b]Surf[/b]Board Modem. And now I can only connect to the internet on my fathers computer and I have no idea how to make the router work so we can both be on simultaneously. Any help?</description>
