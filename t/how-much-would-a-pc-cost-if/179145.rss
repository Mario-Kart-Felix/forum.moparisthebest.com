    <title>How much would a pc cost if</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-much-would-a-pc-cost-if/179145</link>
    <description>I wanted to know, how much it would cost, generally , if a PC had linux, 2gb of ram, Like 50gb hard disk space. And like 2GHz, now if there was anything else involved lemme know. I have a mouse, screen, and a keyboard, keep in mind. However it comes with a screen/mouse/ or keyboard its okay. Don&#39;t tell me to google it, I have. 

You can either post a link with these specifications or tell me how much it would normally cost.</description>
