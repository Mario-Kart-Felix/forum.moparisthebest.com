    <title>[help]Connecting to own server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-connecting-to-own-server/223893</link>
    <description>I port forwarded to 43594 with TCP and I port forwarded it to my default gateway(192.168.1.1).
I signed up on no-ip and I have it on and it&#39;s checked.
I opened port 43594 on my firewall.
My client is on my no-ip and uses port 43594.
My server is running.

I tried it, and I get Error connecting to server but I did everything. It works fine with the IP 127.0.0.1, but I want my server the be public. Help??

EDIT: I fixed my CLASSPATH/PATH and rebooted but it still didn&#39;t work.

EDIT2: I tried it on Hamachi and it worked perfectly fine, so I&#39;m guessing there&#39;s an error with my port forwarding.

EDIT3: I port forwarded with UCP and TCP and changed it to my internal IP.

EDIT4: I went to my no-ip with my browser(FireFox), and it went to my router page.</description>

If you saw EDIT3, I said internal IP which is technically the same as your computer IP. I went to   it without the 43594.</p>
