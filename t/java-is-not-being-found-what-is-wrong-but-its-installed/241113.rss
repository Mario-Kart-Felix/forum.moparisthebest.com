    <title>Java is not being found. What is wrong? But its installed</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-is-not-being-found-what-is-wrong-but-its-installed/241113</link>
    <description>Is it because its too new? I downloaded the latest JDK. I think its 1.6.0.10? Edited the compiler in every client I downloaded and they still will not run. Moparscape is the only one that will run. Moparscape is old and buggy so I&#39;d really like to use a new client. Yes I changed my environmental variables.
