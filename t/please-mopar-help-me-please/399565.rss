    <description>Alright, here&#39;s the situation:

I&#39;m having a little problem with my schedule because me and my girlfriend have diffrent lunch periods, and I didn&#39;t expect us to have some classes together besides lunch at least. Though since because of this, we&#39;re not going to be seeing each other at all, and this worries me a lot. I&#39;m sending a big e-mail to the scheduling administration requesting that they can move me to another lunch period which being third. I&#39;m acting like I&#39;m one of the parents sending out the letter, and talking like I&#39;m not Jimmy/James.

At the moment I have this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Hello SHS Scheduling Administration,
	This email is regarding my son, Jimmy Hernandez. I believe it would be in his best interest if we can somehow find a way to rework his schedule so that I would please ask of you to hear me out on this as I have come across a problem with the sent schedule.
	I have seen that during Jimmy’s work ethnic, it will obviously also require eating lunch at least as earliest as possible, though I would be pleased with regarding suggestions about this matter and appreciate all the help I could get. I’m truly worried about what his current lunch period being, and think that it should be a little earlier, at the latest of third lunch.
	I’ve talked it over with him and he told me that last year because of having fifth period lunch worked for a little while, he said that sometimes he would not even eat breakfast and want to eat around third and fourth period. Which I can conclude because of this, this has affected him in his academic classes. So I would please and will of course a e-mail back about this matter.

Please contact me if you have any further options or questions regarding this email.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#39;m hoping I can have them change their minds because the administration clearly stated that they would not change any lunch schedules but this girl is all I have, and I don&#39;t give a SHIT what people tell me just because I&#39;m 15 and I don&#39;t know about Love, but because of this woman, she has shown me a lot and I can&#39;t stand not being with this girl, please Moparscape, please please help me with this one.

For once in some of your trolling life times, or mean ass life times please ask normal, and a little mature and help me with this one, if I can get them to change their mind, I don&#39;t know what the Hell I&#39;ll do.

So basically what I&#39;m asking is what I typed up good enough, what changes do I need to make to persuade them anything, please help me!</description>

I’m heading into highschool freshman year this year. I have a girlfriend currently, almost our 1 year anniversary. I love her yeah, but i’m not <span class="bbcode-b">IN</span> love with her. We’re too young for love, if you can manage to stick with her the rest of your life, then you guys are in love. But we’re still young, especially me. I know i’m not in love yet and won’t be for a long time.</p>
<p>My uncle met his wife when he was 16, and he’s now 43 and they’re still married. That’s true love. I’m not saying you can’t be in love at a young age, but you have to know what love is.</p>
<p>I can’t see my girlfriend everyday, sometimes I can’t see her for weeks at a time, but we manage to work things out, make the best of it when i see her.</p>
<p>tldr; Make the best out when you see, forget what everybody else says, listen to your heart. Give her what she wants, spoil her, just make sure she has a great time whenever she’s with you.<br>

              <p>This is getting ridiculous, everyone has their own sense of what love is. Mine is not to yell, hit and steal from my like my parents did, you can’t say someone doesn’t know what love is because pure love is what we experience when were at our youngest and at our oldest. I remember how much I loved my best friend when I was 6, I still love her to this day. Long story short love comes in many different forms and just because it isn’t the same as the love you know doesn’t mean its not real.</p>

<p>I think Vain is absolutely right, you need to man up and start taking some fucking responsibility, if you wanna see her that bloody bad talk to her fucking parents, you really do sound like a Drama queen, James.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
I’m dating a girl right now, I haven’t been able to see her for 3 weeks now. She’s still in the city, and stuff, but she’s busy. I’m not being a queen about it because I know I’ll be able to see her soon. Just wait till school finishes.</p>

<p>I never expected in the first place that I would be up her ass 24/7, all the emotions and feelings I have for this girl are true. So stop telling me I don’t know what love is, because I at least know the simple fact of it.</p>
<p>I never intended on becoming some kind of person who tells her girlfriend to move on if we don’t have some classes together, that’s not the point. The point is that after this year she may not even or ever see me again because I’m going to night school.</p>
<p>So get to learn the whole thing before jumping to a big conclusion.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Others</span>: Jesus Christ, I don’t intend on being with her the whole time, stop jumping to conclusions. I never wanted her to be smothered, ever SINGLE time I told her when she’s asked me to go out with her, I continue and continue to request that she hang out with her friends instead, she REFUSES EVERY SINGLE TIME. I’m not going to make her tear up and cry if I don’t come, that’s the stupidest move ever first off. Second off, she wants me to smother her basically, and if that’s what she wants, then I’m not going to stop her from wanting it.</p>

Calm down there big guy, and taking what I’m feeling wrong. I don’t plan on sticking with her 24/7 and stuff. It was a simple statement of telling her that she can or needs to move on when or if we don’t have the same classes.</p>

When I went out on a date with her last night, I told her that she needed to move on if we didn’t have the same classes. She started almost tearing up and told me no, and kept repeating it, she refused and refused, we’ll see what happens if we don’t have the same classes.</p>

              <p>Well all I can say is if you really love this girl you will find a way, I remember when I was in high school I use to get detention because we didn’t have a room just for it and they would put me in some random class room that always turned out to be my girlfriends class because the staff at the school liked me. Also don’t listen to anyone telling you that you don’t know what love is at your age, if anything the teenage years are when you know what love is the most because of all your hormones.</p>
