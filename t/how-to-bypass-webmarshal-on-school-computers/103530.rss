    <title>How to bypass webmarshal on school computers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-bypass-webmarshal-on-school-computers/103530</link>
    <description>I realize there is already a tut out, but it seemed complicated and a lot of people said it didn&#39;t work. I apologize if this is already a topic but I don&#39;t want to spend my time looking for it.

How to bypass:

go to www.vtunnel.com 

then type in the website you want to go to, then your done.  :D

<p>Maybe if you got off your arse and looked you would see i actually have… and maybe u should get off your arse and read this forum rules… the bit where it says search before you post your topic, there might already be one here.</p>

<p>I don’t like flaming but I will under any circumstance defend myself. Okay, so be quite clear here, I did search 2-4 topics and looked in the tutorials list thread for a duplicate thread. I found other ways to bypass the webmarshal. But not this way. I am not going to spend my time looking through 8 or however many pages just to try to contribute to this community, especially if this is what i’m going to get back.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t have gotten so upset had you said “There is already a topic for this, but thanks anyway” or something like that, but you came in here just plain rude. I did take the time out to read a page or two of your last post’s, which came out to mostly be spam or flame.</p>
<p>If you want to talk about rules, maybe you should read some yourself.</p>
<p>Rule 3:<br>
We don’t make spelling mistakes on purpose. We use “you” not “u”, we use “why” not “y” etc.</p>
<p>Rule 6:<br>
We respect each other and other communities. We don’t flame each other or other communities. We don’t fight on the forums.</p>
<p>I could continue flaming but I won’t.</p>
