    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Seeing as this is a semi new server starting out ive got several things i would suggest im a coder myself and have been since 2001 i suggest putting your skills in handlers also moving npcs around making your own original new home if you cant i can help with that i also suggest making more training npcs and a better place to train skills like a woodcutting farm and the more logs you turn in the more exp you get kinda like a mini game i mean it would be really nice if you were a little bit more creative umm i can add custom items and things because thats a little more complicated and you could possibly be looking at having to change clients if you wanted custom items i would also suggest some stuff like a few quests&lt;/blockquote&gt;
