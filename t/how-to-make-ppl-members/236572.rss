              <p>Ok, this is what i do, Open the “Characters” Folder Find the characters name, now it will say character name pass etc, should have Player mem or somthing saying about members anyway, change that to 1, then save, now open the folder that says “members” type the characters name onto that, if that doesnt work pm me.</p>

              <p>Owner god-of-war’s way is how to make someone a mem, but an even better &amp; easier way is to use a makemem\givemem command.</p>
<p>Here is one i just made 4 you.</p>
<p>To work it just type in    ::mem PLAYERSNAME</p>
<p>The playersname bit is where you type the name of the player of which you want to give membership.</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<p><code>if(command.startsWith("mem") &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 2) { {
	try {
		String victim = command.substring(4);
            int index = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(victim);
            client v = (client) server.playerHandler.players[index];
		sendMessage(""+playerName+"");
		BufferedWriter bw = null;
	bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("data/members.txt", true));
	bw.write(""+victim+"");
	bw.newLine();
	bw.flush();
		} 
	catch(IOException ioexception) {
			misc.println("membership.txt: error loading file.");
		}
	}
}</code></p>
<p>You put this code with your other commands, preferably near (under or above) a command like   my pk (search mypk" to find where it is, if you have it) or a command like   suggest (search suggest" to find where it is, if you have it).</p>
<p>Yeah and don’t forget:<br>
Change the number 2 in the above code (playerRights &gt;= 2) to either,</p>
<p>1 for mods plus<br>
2 (leave it as it is) for admins plus<br>
and<br>
3 for owners plus (even tho there isnt anything better than owner… oh well.</p>
<p>and the other thing not to forget is that you still need to make a   members  text document in your data folder, for this to work. Also a    text document named    membership   would be appropraite for you to have in your data folder as well, although you don’t have to.</p>
<p>Hope i helped…<br>

Actually thats incorrect <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>Correct way - Open the data files. Now open members. NOTE: have the player log out for 10-15 seconds as you enter his name into the members file. Now save it and when he logs in he will be a member.</p>
