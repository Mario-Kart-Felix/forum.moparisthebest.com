    <description>well i tried to access my site this morning and it was down. So i left it a while expecting it to be up but 2 hours later still down, So i decided to contact them and tell them about it and hope they could fix it. So i sent them a golden ticket telling them about it, they replyed saying sorry we are doing matinence on the servers and they will be finished in 1 hour. So 1 hour went past still down, 3 hours went by and still down so i contacted them saying about it again and now my files have gone missing. Oh yeah and my site kept going down yesterday and the day before.

so to sum it all up &#39;they have allot of downtime, and do not keep very good care of there clients&#39; so yeah stay away</description>
