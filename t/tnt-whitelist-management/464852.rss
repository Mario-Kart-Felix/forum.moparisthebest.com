    <description>There hasn&#39;t been much said on the topic of the whitelist for a while, so I will reaffirm what the system is supposed to be.


[ol][li]Somebody posts a TNT application in this topic: http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php/topic,536988.0.html[/li]
[li]A staff member views it, and then posts a topic here: http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php/board,227.0.html [/li]
[li]The staff then discuss the applicant, which is then accepted/denied by an administrator[/li][/ol]


There should not be any discussion of applicants outside of that section, it should be treated as staff nominations and such. Posts on the official application topic should only be people applying for TNT, nothing else.

Don&#39;t know what to put in the topic? Try to include things such as: How long they&#39;ve played, past offenses and so on.</description>

              <p>Of course they will know why, as I said, it works like the nomination system. They will be PMed by the administrator stating if they’ve been accepted/declined, and why. It’s hardly an extensive process either, a whole 3 steps  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>To be honest it seems a little unnecessary going through all of those steps, and then the person applying could be declined and not know why?</p>
