    <description>Hello :)

Ok first, i&#39;m trying to change my prayer icons in my sprites and my hp bar&#39;s in my sprites to but i can&#39;t seem to find them anywhere in there. I even looked in hidden folders it&#39;s just so annoying and frustrating.. I just want to know how to edit my hp bars and my prayer icons. Answers would be much appreciated
