    <title>Decompiled Packaged Dodge Ball</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/decompiled-packaged-dodge-ball/380170</link>
    <description>I looked at the failed thread made by a user (not to be named), where he simply edited some sprites and called it his own version. I simply decompiled and packaged the JAVA files so people can see how it works, and can edit it properly. The files are attached.

[i]Note: I take no create in the creation of this game. The game is property of the original creator and no creations using this code should be released unless allowed to do so. If the creator of the game would like the source code removed, I would be happy to do so.[/i]</description>

<p>You really are stupid. Now you’ve released its already leeked so there would be no point in him to ask for the source code to be removed.[/quote]<br>
