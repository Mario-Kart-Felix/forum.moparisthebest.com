    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-i-need-help-i-need-client/440925</link>
    <description>Hey guys, i need a [PI] client with the awesome HP bar, like insidiax v8, but i need a client that works with &quot; HYBRID PVP V3 &quot;, so yeah.. =\  I tried that insidiax V8, but the damage (hitmarks) or hp bar doesn&#39;t show up, when i hit..

I need a good client with that awesome hp bar, that works with a source/server &quot; HYBRID PVP V3 &quot;

Thank you. =]</description>
