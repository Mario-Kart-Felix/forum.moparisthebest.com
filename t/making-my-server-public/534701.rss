    <title>Making my Server public</title>

    <description>Hey moparscape community. I am having trouble making my server public. It is Trisidiax v3 source. I have portfowarded correctly and i have the no-ip working as well. I checked to make sure i portforwarded correctly at canyouseeme.org and it says 43594:success and when i test my webclient on rsps community it says it is online. But when i try to login on another computer using the rspscoding webclient it takes a while then it says error connecting to server. Any suggestions on what the problem could be? Thank you for the help! THANKS!</description>
