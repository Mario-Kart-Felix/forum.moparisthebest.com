    <description>StorkPK Replica the [url=http://www.storkpk-replica.org]RuneScape Classic PKing Private Server[/url] is back.

Rates on exp and on drops are the same as the first and original Stork.

Which could make you 15 1 15 or trade them in for cash to get a decent gear for your coming top StorkPK character.

<p>People are losing interest for a simple reason, Rocket is a fag.</p>
<p>Rocket needs to pull his head from his ass and start working on the game, there hasn’t been ANY patches since 10th of August… I’ve read his posts on DayZ forums and seems like he’s arrogant douchebag and he definetly shouldn’t be the head guy of this game, even though he made it.</p>
<p>Look at this fucking big list of bugs:<br>

Over 600 bugs to fix, yet this guy is slacking and most of those bugs are fairly simple to fix.</p>
<p>Another stupid mistake that Rocket/Bohemia has made is that your player is fully aware of every single tent, player, zombie, vehicle on the server, no matter how far you are from it. With ‘DayZ Navigator’ you can see everything on the server.</p>

</aside>
<p>Big talk from a guy that ran off with subscription money on his own server after failing to give subscribers their full membership, didnt keep in contact with his community and doesnt even have the decency to explain to the community why you did what you did.</p>
<p>Its funny how you talk about bugs need fixing when you yourself ran your own server into the ground because of your lack of communication, bug fixes/updates and emo personality. You haven’t patched or updated your own server since BEFORE 10th August. So, by your post that makes you worse than Day Z and in fact you are the fag that needs to pull his head out of his ass.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy the sub money you got to spend on your car. If i ever find out which car is yours i will gladly break its windscreen and key it all over, back to bare metal.</p>
<p>You should be banned from these forums imo.</p>

</aside>
<p>[/quote]This is not me defending him, because I have no idea what’s been going on with the server from the beginning of august;<br>
That being said, when I did play, Panu was there, handling the server.<br>
But as always, the players just could not appreciate what he was doing, people were insulting him, his girlfriend and so on.<br>
Now, can you really blame him when the players themselves drove him away?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Thats a bunch of crap. No-one was trash talking his girlfriend or him until his lack of expertise and updates forced players to call him into action, to no response from him (even then no-one trashed his gf). He was not even talking to the people he put on as staff and no-one had heard from him in 3 weeks, from the beginning of August. If he was annoyed, pissed off or anything of the sort he would have started banning players, made a quitting post or some other form of communication.</p>
<p>He quit doing updates pretty much as soon as he released an auto-subscription system, which was at the same time he was talking to me on MSN about what cars he should buy for his first car. Even so, he never came online to give the players their full months that they paid for (max sub was 21 days and he said he would add the extra for people when it came to it). I support everyone in charging back their paypal funds and letting Nemesis take the expenses on the chin for his failed server. He had an implied responsibility that he was going to be active and fixing bugs/updating once he started taking players money for the dedicated server and his own pocket.</p>
<p>He has no-one to blame but himself and to do so is confirmation of his immaturity. He should be banned from these forums or at the very least, banned from being able to release new servers in any form of game on this forum.[/quote]Now now, just because you don’t know what happened earlier, doesn’t mean it didnt happen.<br>
I saw the romanian crew insult his gf and him.<br>
This was waaaay before he quit;<br>
Although, I do think he is way too soft on people, several players got away with breaking the rules.<br>
Also, the server was done before he quit, due to people running rampant and stomping on the rules without any consequences.<br>
Another thing is, do you have any sort of proof that he stole the money from subs? Anything other than you saying so?<br>
It is totally possible that he did so, but until he confesses to it, or you break into his paypal account, there’s no way of knowing.<br>
If you have a personal grudge with him, which you seem to have, this is not the place for such a thing.</p>

<p>Has everyone already lost interest in this game or something? I still find it very fun.</p>

</aside>
<p>People are losing interest for a simple reason, Rocket is a fag.</p>
<p>Rocket needs to pull his head from his ass and start working on the game, there hasn’t been ANY patches since 10th of August… I’ve read his posts on DayZ forums and seems like he’s arrogant douchebag and he definetly shouldn’t be the head guy of this game, even though he made it.</p>
<p>Look at this fucking big list of bugs:<br>
<a href="https://dev-heaven.net/projects/dayz/issues?set_filter=1&amp;sort=priority%3Adesc%2Cid%3Adesc&amp;tracker_id=1" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://dev-heaven.net/projects/dayz/issues?set_filter=1&amp;sort=priority%3Adesc%2Cid%3Adesc&amp;tracker_id=1</a><br>
Over 600 bugs to fix, yet this guy is slacking and most of those bugs are fairly simple to fix.</p>
<p>Another stupid mistake that Rocket/Bohemia has made is that your player is fully aware of every single tent, player, zombie, vehicle on the server, no matter how far you are from it. With ‘DayZ Navigator’ you can see everything on the server.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Big talk from a guy that ran off with subscription money on his own server after failing to give subscribers their full membership, didnt keep in contact with his community and doesnt even have the decency to explain to the community why you did what you did.</p>
<p>Its funny how you talk about bugs need fixing when you yourself ran your own server into the ground because of your lack of communication, bug fixes/updates and emo personality. You haven’t patched or updated your own server since BEFORE 10th August. So, by your post that makes you worse than Day Z and in fact you are the fag that needs to pull his head out of his ass.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy the sub money you got to spend on your car. If i ever find out which car is yours i will gladly break its windscreen and key it all over, back to bare metal.</p>
<p>You should be banned from these forums imo.[/quote]</p>

Kid, any server i’ve been mod at ive NEVER abused.<br>
You asked to get out from dm arena,cause you were bugged in there. so i teled u to modroom cause wanted to talk about did abandon you glitch you or not,like u said, then u start shouting in global ‘‘OMFG MOD LEGEND ABUSING OMG HE TELED ME OFF DM’’ when u asked to get out of there, then u were crying off that.</p>
<p>Next, u said i’ve getting demodded and Panu is replacin you as me as mod, and if i get panu on im demodded, well i got him on and nothing happend.</p>
<p>Only thing that happen’d is ur banned there now, by Panu, so dont start to talk shit it was me.<br>
Peace out</p>
