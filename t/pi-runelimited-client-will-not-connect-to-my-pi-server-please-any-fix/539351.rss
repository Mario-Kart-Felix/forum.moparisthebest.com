    <description>[size=10pt][b]Hey

[My Problem]: when i go on runelimited client or anyother resizeable client that i tried it says cannot connect to server use your forums id and pass... 
and server is running and uptime 100% and working on other client at the same time!

i searched for this and didn&#39;t find any fix they just say change source 

but i really worked so hard on this source and fixed alot of stuff dupes glitches and much more also fixed minigames to work more than 90%

so it hard to just delete this one and get new source just because the client dont connect to my server

so please any fix for this problem or any other RESIZEABLE client that works with pi source like mine!

i am working on pi reflexion edited source

any help?
