    <title>What would you have done?</title>

    <description>I had a dream where some crazyass guy was going around killing people, and that he was coming to my house to kill me.
Now for some reason, he killed four people and moved on. Three people were holding clubs (not my family members, didn&#39;t really care if they died) and it came down to me, my mom, my dad, or my sister. I had the club and any of them would gladly take it and be one of the 4 people.
There was a chance we could overpower the guy, but very slim.
I always say I would risk myself for my family but when it came time to make a choice, I was scared out of my mind. Before the outcome of my dream had come, I woke up.

I wan&#39;t to know, if you, one of your siblings and parents were in this situation, tell me what you would do, and why.</description>

<p>I agree with Taharok. I did think in the situation that I would save them but it was wrong for me to assume that knowing when the time came that I wouldn’t.</p>

</aside>
<p>Every time someone tried relating in this topic or giving some sort of advice, you blew them away with your replies. If you don’t want people to discuss your topic, perhaps you should not post it.</p>
<p>And if I was in the position, I really cannot say what I would do. It is an incomprehensible position to be in and saying just plain out that ‘oh, that’s an easy one! ill kill him’ is pure and utter bullshit. You have no idea what killing someone is like and, unless you are not human, you would have a tremendous emotional breakdown from even going through such an event.</p>
<p>Try to imagine that you are in school (any normal day, let’s say the library), and in the distance you hear gunshots. Your immediate reaction is to maybe panic, investigate, or just to try to hear more of it. Well, the gunshot sounds sound less distant and they are more rapid. You are sure you know what is going on and you do not know what to do. You are ushered toward a corner with the rest of the students in the library as well as the librarian and are now in the most frightening position you may ever have to experience. Suddenly, the library doors bang open and you see hooded figures walk in carrying automatics and start firing at the students you are with. You watch in shock as your friend falls to your feet, gasping for breath and dying by the second. After the entire event, you then hear that your sister (who attends the same school) had been shot and killed.</p>
<p>This scenario is a realistic one and pertaining to the possible experience of watching loved ones die before you for little or no cause. You tell me right now that you can honestly watch your friend get shot, watch the blood spurting from him, and then charge after the killer which is the same as saying that you are probably going to die.</p>
<p>Please, do not think you can do things you would never do in that position. It is so devistating, these situations are. Dreaming is so very different, too realistic in essence. But, telling the difference between the dreamworld (never-gunna-happen) and the realworld (so much different) is what is important.</p>

<p>I don’t play violent games.<br>
Maybe violent thoughts of killing my professor, but that’s basically it.</p>
<p>Im guessing when the time came. I would go with swordskid61’s desicison, what happens happens. If my family and I ran, and I got killed and the madman was satisfied, no problem, if my family died, I would have to face it.</p>
<p>I was fucking scared out of my mind. If I could hang myself, wear earplugs, blindfoldmyself and hangmyself by my legs, and wait for my killing, no problem.</p>
