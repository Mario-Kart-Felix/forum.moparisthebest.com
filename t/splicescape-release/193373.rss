    <title>SpliceScape Release?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/splicescape-release/193373</link>
    <description>Well, the reason this is in help is because im not sure wether to release because so many leechers were on original czar and mine is a czar source - A bit of info

Edge Based

Rune C&#39;bow
darkbow and karil bow trains range
range bonus matters !
more drop based... drags in wild drop rune c&#39;bows and dark bows - kq drops fighter torso and more...
Changed drop rates for gs from the darkbeast and other monsters.
Arrow type matters..
Only sharks in shop instead of mantas... (brings fishing more popularity)
rune c&#39;bow max I&#39;ve done is 45... Hits low and high :D
Elf warriors just south of edge bank drop crystal bow and range sets... (THEY GOT ALOT OF HP) Crystal bow is also non members and is fixed to be better... (must wield 1 rune arrow to hit high) :P

well should i release or would it be to many leechers?</description>
