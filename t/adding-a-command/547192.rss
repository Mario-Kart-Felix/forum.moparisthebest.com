<p>First of all, you must create a ‘String’ variable. So what I want you to do is, above</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Now also, just before ‘setRights’, make sure it is locating the player class.

<p>or replace your setRights line with; <code>
player.setRights(7);</code></p>
<p>If you receive another error please quote me. Thank you.</p>
<p>p.s. I noticed that you won’t actually find the player with that command, as you are using a variable that you have not defined. Basically, your trying to find ‘target’ except you haven’t actually defined who target is. So what you need to do is create a player instance that gets the player with the name ’ tim '. You can do so by adding something similar to this;</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Player target = World.getPlayers().getPlayerInServer(name);</code></pre>
<p>It won’t be exactly like that, so I don’t suggest copying and pasting it, but have a browse through your methods in your World class and see what you can find.[/quote]</p>
<p>You are saying save files are the same for a 718 as a 317? Even server structures are different. If you want to add a command or adjust player rights, it depends if your save is in a database or a text file, serialized object form, or with json.<br>
If you want to adjust playerRights for a player (what he is trying to do do himself)<br>
The source is required because i would like to break down the reason of why all of his variables are undefined. If someone knows the source he is using, they can help (by giving the real variables/format).</p>

<p>So we can give him help based on his base server. Example being that PI servers have packaging and use the variable ‘c’ for the Client object (Really the player, Client extends Player) and delta servers (9 of 10) do not have any packaging, and all of it’s code is basically handled in the client class alone.<br>
It’s not because “the language is different”, it’s so we can tell them where files are and etc if we know it.</p>
<p>Your help, while good, isn’t what he wanted.<br>
He apparently (reading the command) wants to make the player “tim” owner when the command is executed.</p>
<p>So, OP, I believe you’ll need to take a look in your World class to get the actual method, if you have it. But there should be a method somewhere in it that returns a player based on a string parameter.<br>
Example name: getPlayerForName(String playerName)</p>
<p><code>
if(cmd[0].equalsIgnoreCase("giveowner")) {
     Player targetPlayer = World.getPlayerForName("tim");// alternatively, you could construct the name through what you typed in the command
     if(targetPlayer == null) {
          self.sendMessage("Error, player \"Tim\" is null.");// change self.sendMessage to the appropriate one..
          return;
     }
     targetPlayer.setRights(7);
          self.sendMessage("Player \"Tim\" is now owner.");// Again here.
     // I think you would want to either save or disconnect (which would save) the player here, so they can relogin and the client will update their rights.
}</code></p>
