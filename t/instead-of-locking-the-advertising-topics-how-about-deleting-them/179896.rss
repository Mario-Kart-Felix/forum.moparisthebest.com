    <title>Instead Of Locking The Advertising Topics how about deleting them?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/instead-of-locking-the-advertising-topics-how-about-deleting-them/179896</link>
    <description>Well I&#39;ve seen some mods and other staff locking the topics that advertise forums and servers.Locking them doesn&#39;t do anything except wait for other topic&#39;s to get bumped or posted in so that the locked topic gets moved down the list.Instead of locking how about deleting it and sending them a PM about how this is wrong.In my eyes I see it as people can still look at the site or the ip of the thing there advertising.Just a suggestion don&#39;t flame me and this section is for moparisthebest.com and moparisthebest.com.</description>

              <p>On moparscape, there is no such thing as ‘it servers as a warning to others’. Moparscapers do it their way and only occasionally get banned for it.</p>

              <p>Well usually when mods lock a topic for advertising they will edit the original post to get rid of the URL/SERVER that is being advertised. Just to tell you that.</p>
<p>Not really sure about why they do not hide them.</p>
