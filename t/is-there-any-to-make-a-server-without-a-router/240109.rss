    <title>Is there any to make a server without a router?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-there-any-to-make-a-server-without-a-router/240109</link>
    <description>Is there any way to do this? 
Please don&#39;t say &quot;go buy a router&quot; and such, I CANT  afford one. 
There has got to be a way to get my server online, cause runescape, I 
KNOW they don&#39;t have 100+ routers for each server.
 (sorry. Its upsetting that people can&#39;t make a server unless they got dsl only)

Please help me,
