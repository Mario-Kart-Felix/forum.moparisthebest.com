<p>Well, you need to remove your Advertisement you’ve edited into the Thread now. You’re welcome for the tip. Why not just copy/paste the sample Application I gave you, instead of picking and choosing things from it/rewording select strings? You’ll probably also want to post exactly what you can ‘bring to the table’ in detail, and also list the compensation you have in mind.</p>

Simply posting three sentences and buying a public Domain isn’t enough I’m afraid.

In other words, in this current state, your R.S.P.S. will fall flat of your expectations, and will probably be labeled as a ‘leech’ like so many others.[/quote]</p>
