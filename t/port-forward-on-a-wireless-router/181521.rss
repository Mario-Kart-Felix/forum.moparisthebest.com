    <title>Port forward on a wireless router?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/port-forward-on-a-wireless-router/181521</link>
    <description>Ok, I&#39;ve been at making a server for a long time now and I&#39;m sick of it. On runelocus I heard someone talk about if they can portforward on a wireless router and they said things like it was tough or they gave up. It didn&#39;t really answer the question very well. I have the WRT54G wireless router and hoping if anyone has the guide to portforward with it. Been stuck on this forever. If you add me on msn n0vak0@hotmail.com I would appreciate it :]</description>
