    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-a-webclient/350466</link>
    <description>Ok, I searched the forums, but I could not find a legitimate answer for this question, if anyone could please link me to a guide, or tell me how to make one, I would be very grateful and it would get rid of the need for people to download my client that is 324mb :)</description>
