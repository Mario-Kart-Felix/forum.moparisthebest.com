    <title>Which drugs should really be illegal? why and why not?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-drugs-should-really-be-illegal-why-and-why-not/524494</link>
    <description>I been researching and some illegal drugs with harsh penalties still exist such as
psilocybin mushrooms and cannabis, but when studied they promote new brain cells,
Quite possibly reduce anxiety and promote better moods, with little to no toxicity
I have never heard of death from Psilocybin mushrooms/cannabis itself, you would
probably have to ingest an amount that would kill you from the physical overload and trauma
rather than toxicity itself, too much caffeine, fat, Pop/soda, sugar probably does more damage then these substances
What are your opinions? and if you took too much of any substances fact is you&#39;ll probably feel
a lot less healthy, whereas cannabis or psilocin will probably just make you fall alsleep.

Compare Smoking cannabis buds to alcohol for an example
Or Alcohol to amanita muscaria
Sure smoking has it&#39;s downsides, but so does ingestion.</description>

<p>I’m not so sure you understand what ketamine is, it has no physical addiction and needles are only used in extreme cases ~1% of users.</p>
<p>The only addiction is a phycological one and is true of any drug, if you have an addictive personality you will probably enjoy taking drugs - no matter what, and because ketamine is cheap and readily available you will probably do that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.steps2rehab.com/addictions/ketamine/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.steps2rehab.com/addictions/ketamine/</a></p>
<blockquote>Whilst there is no evidence for the development of a physical dependency to Ketamine, the chances of developing a psychological addiction are high. Thus, while an abuser can stop using without any known withdrawal effects, the desire to continue to use remains significantly strong.</blockquote>

<p>Wouldn’t call meth awesome, but if it wasn’t illegaal it never would have been cut up with god knows what else, which is really the most dangerous part.  Especially in drugs like heroin where some places its purity is less than 10%.  Just because of black market.</p>
<p>Drugs will always exist.  There ill always be a demand you can’t make them just go away, so why not deal with it in a way which will save lives and minimize damages (both physically and socially).</p>

<p>What should be illegal is the mistakes people make on drugs.  If I do an 8ball of coke, go out and kill someone, then charge me with murder.  But if I do an 8ball of coke and commit no violent crimes or effect anyone in a negative manner then why should I be in trouble?</p>
<p>Having said this, I think many drugs are very terrible and evil, cocaine being by far the most evil, and don’t suggest anyone ever does it.</p>
<p>Cannabis being legal is just a generally accepted fact by everyone who, unfortunately, has no say in its legality.  One day when the old generations die off and ours take parliament things will be different.</p>

probably have to ingest an amount that would kill you from the physical overload and trauma<br>
rather than toxicity itself, too much caffeine, fat, Pop/soda, sugar probably does more damage then these substances<br>
What are your opinions? and if you took too much of any substances fact is you’ll probably feel<br>
a lot less healthy, whereas cannabis or psilocin will probably just make you fall alsleep.</p>
<p>Compare Smoking cannabis buds to alcohol for an example<br>
Or Alcohol to amanita muscaria<br>
Sure smoking has it’s downsides, but so does ingestion.</p>
