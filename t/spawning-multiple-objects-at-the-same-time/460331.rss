    <title>Spawning multiple objects at the same time</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/spawning-multiple-objects-at-the-same-time/460331</link>
    <description>I&#39;m currently coding farming for my server, and as some of you may know, a lot of &quot;object spawning&quot; or &quot;object replacing&quot; is involved with this skill.

I normally spawn/replace objects in a loop, which has been going pretty well until I&#39;ve started to do this on patches with 20+ tiles. Because the objects are being created in a loop, you can visually see the objects spawning one at a time.

I was wondering if there is a way to spawn these objects all in unison, rather than in a loop one at a time.</description>
