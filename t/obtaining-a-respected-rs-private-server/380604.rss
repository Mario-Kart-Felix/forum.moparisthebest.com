    <description>[size=90pt]STILL BEING WRITTEN[/size]









[size=16pt]A RSPS is where players interact together and enjoy the lovely time of skilling, combat and much more. If you are an owner of a server and want the best for your players, you need to obtain a respected server. I will show you a few factors affecting this and how you can help them to change or avoid them.[/size] 

[b][size=15pt]Economy[/size][/b]

Economy is the system of how money in your server goes. Let&#39;s say that your server uses coins for currency, as an example. If I give max cash to a noob, what do you think (s)he will do? It all depends. He or she can drop it, make me go bankrupt. Or he/she can divide it and give it to other noobs. Now what do you think a noob that is really stupid will do when he/she get&#39;s 50M? They might do lot&#39;s of things that can ruin your server&#39;s economy. Here are a few things:

Dupe - The player will duplicate the money making it 100m, 200m 400m 800m 1.6b, and so on.
Drop - Waste the money by losing it.
Quit - Quit the server wasting the money in another way.
Give to other players - One player that can be given to can do any of the above with the money.

While giving maybe 5m to a player or so may seem king and generous, be aware of the side affects and what can really happen. Think - Will they really use it? What if they waste it? What if they dupe it? What if they give to someone I dislike?

Being aware of your server&#39;s economy is really important. A bad economy can include the following:

- Everyone get&#39;s bored as there is no challenge to making money
- People quit because the server is lame
- Everyone ends up with max cash easily.

Here are a few strategies and tips to help your server&#39;s economy stay good and not drift away like many servers.

- Prevent duping. If a person starts with 10m, they can double it and in 5 minutes they are a billionaire. 
- Don&#39;t give to much starting equipment! A player can find his or her way if the server is clean. Giving a 500m or rare item starter can do really bad things to your server. The player can think &quot;Oh this server sucks, I&#39;ll just dupe this cash and give it to some noob!&quot;
- Don&#39;t make NPC rare drop&#39;s rate so high! If players are no lifers and kill it constantly, they will easily get the rares and become rich!
- Re-check any system you will make that will affect curreny. For example: PK points or other currencies can damage the larger currency.
- Reduce the power of extremely strong weapons. Weapons that hit 40+ are considered power weapons. Players who hold power weapons will easily kill other players and it will get unfair.

Maintaining a good economy is a very good start to a respected RSPS. Remember, your players depend on the server&#39;s quality to stay or leave. One thing that will make them love your server is a good economy.

<p>This made me LOL</p>
<p>Obviously you wouldn’t give them the money… but if you do then:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fix the dupes</li>
<li>Let them drop it, I don’t see why you keep saying “waste” over and over</li>
<li>Players quitting does not ruin the economy</li>
</ol>
<p>Economy is usually ruined by owners making it too easy to make money, as you mentioned monster drops shouldn’t be too common. But it doesn’t stop there, money from skills (eg thieving) should not flow in the millions, especially at lower levels and shops should only contain the very basic raw materials and a limited stock of finished/-unmakeable products.</p>
<p>It really depends on the type of server though. For example on a PK-based server the economy will generally be weaker because there won’t be as many options for making money (or as many items traded) but the ones that are available will over-compensate and yield a greater amount of cash more often than not.</p>

              <p>[size=90pt]STILL BEING WRITTEN[/size]</p>
<p>[size=16pt]A RSPS is where players interact together and enjoy the lovely time of skilling, combat and much more. If you are an owner of a server and want the best for your players, you need to obtain a respected server. I will show you a few factors affecting this and how you can help them to change or avoid them.[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[size=15pt]Economy[/size]</span></p>
<p>Economy is the system of how money in your server goes. Let’s say that your server uses coins for currency, as an example. If I give max cash to a noob, what do you think (s)he will do? It all depends. He or she can drop it, make me go bankrupt. Or he/she can divide it and give it to other noobs. Now what do you think a noob that is really stupid will do when he/she get’s 50M? They might do lot’s of things that can ruin your server’s economy. Here are a few things:</p>
<p>Dupe - The player will duplicate the money making it 100m, 200m 400m 800m 1.6b, and so on.<br>
Drop - Waste the money by losing it.<br>
Quit - Quit the server wasting the money in another way.<br>
Give to other players - One player that can be given to can do any of the above with the money.</p>
<p>While giving maybe 5m to a player or so may seem king and generous, be aware of the side affects and what can really happen. Think - Will they really use it? What if they waste it? What if they dupe it? What if they give to someone I dislike?</p>
<p>Being aware of your server’s economy is really important. A bad economy can include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone get’s bored as there is no challenge to making money</li>
<li>People quit because the server is lame</li>
<li>Everyone ends up with max cash easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few strategies and tips to help your server’s economy stay good and not drift away like many servers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevent duping. If a person starts with 10m, they can double it and in 5 minutes they are a billionaire.</li>
<li>Don’t give to much starting equipment! A player can find his or her way if the server is clean. Giving a 500m or rare item starter can do really bad things to your server. The player can think “Oh this server sucks, I’ll just dupe this cash and give it to some noob!”</li>
<li>Don’t make NPC rare drop’s rate so high! If players are no lifers and kill it constantly, they will easily get the rares and become rich!</li>
<li>Re-check any system you will make that will affect curreny. For example: PK points or other currencies can damage the larger currency.</li>
<li>Reduce the power of extremely strong weapons. Weapons that hit 40+ are considered power weapons. Players who hold power weapons will easily kill other players and it will get unfair.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maintaining a good economy is a very good start to a respected RSPS. Remember, your players depend on the server’s quality to stay or leave. One thing that will make them love your server is a good economy.</p>
