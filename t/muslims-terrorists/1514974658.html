no one knows who actually did 9/11, unless the U.S. Government had cameras in the planes, which I doubt, for all we know, it could’ve been a drunk pilot.<br>

<p>Check my recent posts, I explain why there are there.</p>
<p>War for oil is bullshit and is why we need to stop the media from covering this war and turning us against it.</p>

<p>A drunk pilot? hah there are so many things wrong with that.</p>
<p>[ul][li]They would not allow a drunk pilot to fly a plane, his co pilot would of noticed or something[/li]<br>
[li]There was two planes that crashed into the towers, does that mean they was both drunk or just some really strange coincidence[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>The reason why people say it was Muslim extremists that launched them attacks is because its supposedly bin laden who had them arranged and there has been a number of videos of him bragging about these attacks, and praising the bombers.</p>
<p>Also, no one is saying all Muslims are Terrorists, just at this moment all the recent terrorists attacks are by Muslim extremists.<br>
No one calls all the irish terrorists because yes, quite a few years ago us, here in england had to put up with the IRA (some irish terrorist group) bombing major citys around england, car bombs, everything, but no one thinks of the irish as terrorists just like no one thinks of the muslims as terrorists, it just so happens the ones that have been carrying out terrorist attacks recently has been the muslims.</p>
<p>During the IRA attacks here people used to say much the same as they say now, “LOOK AN IRISH MAN, TERRORIST!”, pretty much the same thing as what they say about the muslims now but replacing muslim with irish.</p>

<p>No offence Lothy, but are you raicist?<br>
You do know, most muslims think Ben Laden is a disgrace and are against forcing people to pray?<br>
In the prophets day, they lived with Jews in ‘Madina’, and they got along fine.<br>
Its just these days, people misread the Quran, and think Jihad is fighting anyone not muslim. Which is wrong, the prophet fought the people that started a battle on Islam, he even said to his troops “Be merciful to your enemys, and do not slash anything above their soldiers.”<br>
And the U.A.E. is a muslim country, Dubai, which is a city has millions of non muslims not practicing.<br>
So does Egypt, Lebanon, and every other muslim country.</p>

        <p>Not all muslims are terrorist, but the main part of them in the Netherlands are criminal. Why? Because they come from poor countries, and they won’t stop stealing. Last weak a Muslims stabbed a kid, cause he threw a pen to his head. If you look at the Dutch prisoners, 90% is coloured. It says something…</p>
