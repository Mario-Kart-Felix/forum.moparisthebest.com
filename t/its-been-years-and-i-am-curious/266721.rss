    <title>It&#39;s been years - and I am curious</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/its-been-years-and-i-am-curious/266721</link>
    <description>Edit: Well, of course I was right. This IS an improper forum to post in.  :(
If you must, then lock this, but hey at least it&#39;s a decent question to ask.

Hey guys, I am VERY sure all of you forgot about me.  ;)

Anyways, it has been just about 2+ years since I have last visited the RSCC (RuneScape Cheating Community) and I just wanted to ask how the private server development has been going?

I&#39;m not necessarily interested in developing private servers anymore and bots, well, I got tired of getting banned from RS.  :rolleyes: 

So ya! What&#39;s the progress with private servers nowadays? I&#39;ve noticed a server advertising in HD graphics and another server with... player wings (interesting!). If you would consider this the wrong forum, then sorry, just making a quick post.

If you do remember me, let me know!  ;D
