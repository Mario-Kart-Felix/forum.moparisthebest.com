<p>Please post if you looked. I want to know opinions and what to add etc… I need ideas.</p>
<p>Sorry for it being so long but to know everything that is going on you really need to read it. I tried to shorten things up.</p>
<p>Well here is the update list I keep I will just post what I made and show pics.</p>
<p>UPDATED Will post all updates here as this will be my official project thread.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Working on MY verison of smithing. Hopefully a basic where you can actually get items from bars and bug free!</span></p>
<p>9/22 Updates<br>
Smithing Added!<br>
This is about 40% done<br>
Can smith…<br>
Platebody, Platelegs<br>
Full Helmets, Arrow tips So far…<br>
Proper lvl req along with bars</p>
<p>9/19 Updates<br>
Arrows will now drop as your range.<br>
So you will not lose all of your arrows.<br>
Same with bolts.<br>
Ava Accumulator works-will make arrows last longer before you lose them.</p>
<p>Next I will make it so it does the same with Knifes. Stay Tuned!<br>
Added ranging following! Credits to “sami” from google for the idea. But I made it a lot better<br>
Will post vid.-FINISHED range following!</p>
<p>9/17 Updates<br>
So I was going through max hit formula again because I thought hits were too high.<br>
I looked at a few rs max hit calcs and now they are close. With full bandos and max str bonus etc…<br>
You can max with 58 with gs. Tipit says max is 60. Spec so far maxed 74. I went through and fixed up weapons again to make em even better. I lowered how high void melee can hit, it will hit lower then max str bonus because it was dumb having it better. Don’t get me wrong it will be good, just not as good as full bandos lol.<br>
So that spec you see down low with void on, you won’t hit that high.</p>
<p>KBD Vid <a href="http://tinypic.com/player.php?v=apgox3&amp;s=3" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://tinypic.com/player.php?v=apgox3&amp;s=3</a><br>
Spirit Beast Vid  <a href="http://tinypic.com/player.php?v=10s6k90&amp;s=3" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://tinypic.com/player.php?v=10s6k90&amp;s=3</a></p>
<p>9/16 Updates<br>
Special Attacks…<br>
NOTE: I went through EACH AND EVERY weapon to make them base off max hit plus adding so it will hit higher<br>
without using (gethit) So now… Specials don’t ignore opponents def bonus. But they don’t hit<br>
like crap if someone is wearing bandos. Before you could hit 80 with ags everytime on someone with bandos.</p>
<p>EVERY WEAPON that has a special bases off of your max hit now!<br>
D hally- perfected.<br>
Dragon 2h- perfected<br>
DDS- Perfected<br>
G-Maul - Perfected, (actually a good ko wep)<br>
Drag Long- Perfected<br>
Ags- Perfected<br>

Bgs - Perfected (Lowers stats, hits good)<br>
Sgs- Perfected (You know the deal etc…)<br>
Dragon Claw- As stated above will post again.<br>
First hit is your normal/max hit (hopefully you will hit high XD)<br>
Second Hit is half of first<br>
Third is half of second<br>
and the fourth is same as third<br>
Drag Skimmy- Kinda perfected (Will take protect prayers off, Made it so it will turn prayer icon off.<br>
Before it stayed on and you could not tell wtf was going on.)<br>
Whip Perfected- Hits Pretty good, its nothing fancy, just a whip special…<br>
Dragon Mace- Perfected (Just that still shows as darkbow in inv but wutever…)<br>
Dark Bow - Perfected (Pretty good projectile, Also both attacks base of max hit not random hits etc…)<br>
Magic Shortbow - Not done, still working on it, I want to actually make it usable and good.</p>
<p>Sorry if i did not list all. But for the most part there ya go…</p>
<p>9/13<br>
Herblore- Added unfinished pots.<br>
Added second ingredients to add to unfinished.<br>
DDS Special now bases off you max hit. Which is a whole nother forumla.<br>
Instead of using (gethit) which means anyone with any level could hit 30-30<br>
Perfected Energy pots.<br>
If your drink it it will add +10 to your run.<br>
But if your run is 90-99 it will make it so it wont go over 100.<br>
EX: 96+POT=100 RUN, 94+POT=100 ETC… But 60+pot=70 run</p>
<p>Added godsword stuff.- anims,specs etc…<br>
New right click menu.<br>
Fixed picking up dupe from floor.<br>
Made Acrane Spirit Shield give extra mage bonus.<br>
Divine will just be stronger then rs (Defence Wise)<br>
Elysian will randomly only do 1/2 the dmg that was supposed to be dealt and will send a message so u will know.<br>
Made spirit beast<br>
spirit beast has 2 attacks. mostly range…<br>
random mage hit which can do 50 dmg!(which makes it hard)<br>
made it multi.<br>
Pretty much impossible to solo, took me full inv in max ranged gear and dragon bolts to solo.<br>
I had 0 food, 7hp, and d bolts will be hard to get.<br>
Fixed up combat so hits will be so much better and realistic.<br>
You can actually tank.<br>
Attack option only shows in wild.<br>
Pure pking is a lot better.<br>
Whip special added and hits good.<br>
wearing bandos and torag you can still hit 30±30+ with d bow and arrows.<br>
Added new ancient magic interface<br>
added new normal magic interface. No more scroll bar., Black box hovers.<br>
added new weapon interfaces.<br>
spec bar works, still glitchy.<br>
added dragon arrows- can only use with d bow.<br>

When server resets it should save a lot more recent then it did.<br>
Godsword smithing added. Only made blades and hilts. No need for full.<br>
KBD FULLY CHANGED. iNFO…<br>
SO KBD had a few attacks. All 3 types (mage range melee) Use protect mage, if you dont he will hit 50+!<br>
He will hit a random melee/range attack which can max at 27 dmg. One mage attack hits through pray max = 13.<br>
Also with any attack if you dont have anti shiled your dead. can hit up to 70!<br>
But kbd is soloable but is not easy. It is also not in wild.<br>
Added fully working equip screen.<br>
Will show “-” or “+” depending if your bonus is positive or negative.<br>
Can add/remove items and it will update your bonus.<br>
Made the interface close with the (X)<br>
Working ring of recoil</p>
<p>Now pics…</p>
<p>I really like the combat. Do not get fooled by the hits and be liek amg u hit soo high everytime its garbadge.</p>
<p>Those took me a while to get a nice max hit like them.</p>
