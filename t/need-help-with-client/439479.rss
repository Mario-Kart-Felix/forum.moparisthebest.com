    <title>Need help with client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-client/439479</link>
    <description>Well, I downloaded a source and a client, Have winrar, also extracted both client/source. Thats about as far as i got on this. Not alot of experience in the rsps creation field.    I have JDK, the right one too..     I think i&#39;ve done it all right up untill now, When run the source everything goes normal ( i think ) then when running the client the &quot; command promt &quot; comes up just as when i run the source and it has a bunch of writing and such and nothing happens after this, command promt stays , nothing opens..    Not sure what the problem is, but if anyone can help me i&#39;d be very grateful. :D</description>
