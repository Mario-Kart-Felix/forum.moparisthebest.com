    <title>Need help with Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-client/6741</link>
    <description>Ok, I need a good base script, that runs the game. I need one with monsters, NPCs, and where the ::pickup command works. Cheezscape&#39;s source code is a piece of sh*t. 

I also need help making it where I put a download link on my webpage, and make it where they download a window for my server that limits them as a regular user.</description>
