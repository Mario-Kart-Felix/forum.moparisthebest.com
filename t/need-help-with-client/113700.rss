    <description>[center][u]Need help with my Moparscape client![/u][/center]

It keeps giving me the 5 instructions to do:

[b]To fix this try the following (in order):

1:Try closing ALL open web-browser windows, and reloading
2:Try clearing your web-browsers cache from tools-&gt;internet options
3:Try using a different game-world
4:Try rebooting your computer
5:Try selecting a different version of Java from the play-game menu[/b]

I have tried all of these - and still nothing. I have Java 6u1, i have cleared my cache from internet options. But none of these work. 

Below is a picture of what my client command prompt shows.

I want to know what &quot;Error: loaderror bobStarting up 20&quot; means!!!
I&#39;m pretty sure that is the reason this is not loading. Can anybody help me?

PLEASE IF ANYONE HAS THE SAME PROBLEM AND KNOWS HOW TO FIX THIS, OR IF YOU HAVE ALREADY FIXED IT PLEASE POST BELOW! I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT!  :)    

[center]Thanx Very Much!! ;)[/center]</description>
