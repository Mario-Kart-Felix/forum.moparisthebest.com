    <description>Figured I should post this too..

I don&#39;t think you should post the same thing or answer a question when it was already answered. Your basically posting the same thing the person did above you.

It&#39;s spam and theres no point. If anybody disagrees with me feel free to voice your opinion.

And on a side note, *ahem* http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,68842.0.html

Kind of falls into this, if you decide to go against this and just post anyway don&#39;t flame.</description>
