    <title>How to make a normal staff ancient?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-a-normal-staff-ancient/331905</link>
    <description>Hai,

I was just wondering how I can change a staff from Normal, to Ancient, so it can cast ancient magics.

I have searched for over 2 hours now, and haven&#39;t found anything at all. 

Pretty much what my problem is, is this:
I have a Zuriel Staff that casts Normal Magics.
It says &quot;You cannot cast ancient magic spells with a regular staff!&quot;
I want to make it so I can cast ancient magics.

Thanks in advance,
Ace.</description>
