    <title>Weapon timer Glitch?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/weapon-timer-glitch/437091</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve got a cammy pvp source and there is a glitch on there where if you hit with a 2h then click on your karils bow, eat and at the same time, It will cancel out the 2h weapon timer and hit as a kbow would hit, And cause to hit quick 50&#39;s and 40&#39;s. Just wanting to know if anybody had the intelligence to teach me how to fix this. 


Thankss Please give me feedback!</description>
