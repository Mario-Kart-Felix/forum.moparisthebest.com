    <title>P server ::char HELP!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/p-server-char-help/286499</link>
    <description>ok me and my friend max are having trouble.. For only a certain person, it doesn&#39;t save the char completely. like when we type ::char and set up our character and log out and log back in it goes back to normal. we have tried every possible solution, deleted the account and remade it, tried to set up custom clothes using the character folder and file, tried to copy someone else`s outfit. still fail.. if anyone has a answer to this problem.. please post here or email me at anooprai@hotmail.com.
