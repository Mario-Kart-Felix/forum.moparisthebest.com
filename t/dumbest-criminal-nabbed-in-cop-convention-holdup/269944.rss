    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - A retired police chief said he was robbed by &quot;probably the dumbest criminal in Pennsylvania,&quot; at a police officers&#39; convention on Friday morning. John Comparetto said as he came out of a stall in the men&#39;s room, a man pointed a gun in his face and demanded money. There were 300 narcotics officers from Pennsylvania and Ohio at the gathering.

Comparetto gave up his money and cell phone. But when the man fled, Comparetto and some colleagues chased him. They arrested a 19-year-old man as he was trying to leave in a taxi.

The suspect is also awaiting trial on four previous robbery charges.

The suspect was arraigned and taken to Dauphin County Prison. When a reporter asked the suspect for comment as he was led out of court, he said, &quot;I&#39;m smooth.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
