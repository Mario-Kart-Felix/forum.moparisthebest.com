&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]StarCraft MMO blasts into orbit[/b]
Blizzard&#39;s new sci-fi MMO is set to rock the world later this month, CVG has learned

The long-rumoured new instalment of Blizzard&#39;s massive StarCraft series is set to be unveiled later this month - and it&#39;s another massively-multiplayer online game in the style of World of Warcraft, CVG can reveal.

Well placed US sources have revealed to us that the StarCraft MMO will be unveiled at an upcoming Blizzard event on May 19 in South Korea - the epicentre of the sci-fi RTS series&#39; rabid fandom.

The unveiling of the new instalment has previously been rumoured for the South Korea event, though we now know that the title is in fact an online spin-off and not a new RTS game as previously assumed.

Of course this is massive news for both Vivendi and the MMO world; Blizzard&#39;s other online offering World of Warcraft has topped 6 million subscribers and is arguably the biggest game around today.

The question is, is there room for both World of Warcraft and a StarCraft MMO? The later will have to be a very different type of online game to convince gamers to subscribe to both of Blizzard&#39;s pair.

We will of course let you know as soon as soon as Blizzard officially confirms the game on May 19.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
