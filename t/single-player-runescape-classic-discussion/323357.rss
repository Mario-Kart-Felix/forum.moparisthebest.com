    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/single-player-runescape-classic-discussion/323357</link>
    <description>       I had the idea of a new venture for rsc, no more reliant on players but really just development. Basicly just something to discuss and hopefully find some people who have an interest in it.

       Generally it would be based around quests, final bosses in which would provide combat level bonus&#39;s and unlock items. Definately something to provide a new perspective of the game.

      What kind of opinions and idea&#39;s do you guys have about such a venture? I would think that you wouldn&#39;t need to max out 123 combat to finish the game, but it would certainly require a high combat and alot of gaming time, but not as much as the normal experience rates would take up.

     Expensive hosting wouldn&#39;t be an issue anymore and money could be made from either donations or just advertisements.

Exactly my point.If we’re going to create a single player rsc, it cannot be all original. Something has to go; imo the engine.</p>
