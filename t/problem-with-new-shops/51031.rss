    <title>Problem with new shops</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-new-shops/51031</link>
    <description>I have a problem with my shops.
Untill about a week ago, all shops worked fine.
But when i try to add new shops, i can not open them.
And when trying to use a other npc for a working excisting shop, it wont work either.
But when putting the old npc back, it works again  :confused:
Anyone got an idea of what the problem may be? It is really anoying

Edit: Untill a week ago all newly added shops worked normal, but now  they stopped working too O.o</description>
