    <description>[size=24pt]Chaos Returns[/size]

Hello, First off i want to say that yes i am hosting this on Hamachi and there is a perfectly good reason for that which you will find if you download the server, there is a file in the folder that says &quot;Useful Information&quot; if you download please take your time to read it

Let us begin.
Chaos Returns is a 718 loading 742 Runescape Private Server that is ran through Hamachi.
Every single skill is 100% Working except from Dungeoneering which has been started but isn&#39;t
completely finished.
I will list some of the features that this server has to offer below.

- Change character appearance and gender.
- 742 items and npcs 
- Working double xp weekend, [Friday - Sunday]
- Perfect PvM &amp; PvP
- All Mini-Games 100% 
And so much more...

There will be a folder called &quot;Pictures&quot; when you download. there you will be able to see
what the server has to offer. sorry that i am not uploading any to this, i may soon just not right now
so bare with me.

And finally.
This server is simply to have fun and for anyone that wants a small (pass-time).
This means that i do not want any foul language or behavior, this sounds bad but i want a
nice and calm environment so that everyone can just have a good time. 

Also, Please no bad comments to this thread, i don&#39;t want any hassle for just posting a server
advertisement, Feel free to Rep++, feels weird saying that, Never have before  :P 
But anyway come on and enjoy yourself
