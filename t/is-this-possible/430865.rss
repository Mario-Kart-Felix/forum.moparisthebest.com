    <title>Is this possible?</title>

    <description>Hello guys,

I&#39;m currently kinda &quot;making&quot; my own server starting from scratch and i&#39;ve added quite alot in one day already, but my friend wants to play my server whilst im still constructing my server. I know I need to shut down the server and then compile to make changes work obviously but I mean, before I do that, could I make a hamachi network, send my client to my friend so that he changes the IP in the client to my hamachi IP and then connect to my server? I know this is gonna be an issue when u get alot of people but we just want to play just us 2 for now.

thx guys</description>

              <p>yes it is possible. do just that… However, everytime the server is shut down, by logic, He will be kicked… I dont know if you can keep it hosted and work and recompile… i believe there is a VPN program by microsoft that allows you to make changes to your work and run it off of your hamachi network… this program also takes snapshots that give you the ability to back it up to that point. For instance youmake a change and it recompiles wrong you can back up a step with the program</p>
