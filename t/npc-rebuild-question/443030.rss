    <title>Npc Rebuild Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-rebuild-question/443030</link>
    <description>Okay with the Npc rebuild method how would I execute it? like let&#39;s say I had some event going on in my server which gave the boolean &#39;eventSpawned&#39; a value of true... but I need to rebuild the npc list everytime the event is called... My event calls a method which misc.randoms a couple things, and depending on the outcome of that , different npcs spawn for the different outcomes... so basically what I&#39;m trying to say is... how would I make these npcs from the event disappear once the event is called again, to avoid double spawning(if the event outcome is the same) and to remove event 1&#39;s NPCS(example) , because the outcome from the misc.random event called the event 2?(example)  ... if you need more explaining just ask:P all help appreciated</description>

              <p>Show some sample code so I can better understand you, but from what I did understand you simply want NPC’s in a specified coordinate to vanish every time a new “wave” (so to speak) is initiated. To do that just create a boolean with the coordinates of the area and if a new wave is called have all entities within that boolean vanish.</p>
