<p>I already installed bukkitforge, that’s how the other plugin works.

Well I had to roll back the world to the 5th before the server would even finish loading. Now we have found out the offline authentication plugin isn’t completely compatible with all the machinery of ftb so it’s constantly spamming stack traces in the console. So the temporary solution given by Tom was just to enable online mode so at least some people could play problem is, mitb’s server doesn’t allow outgoing connections so the server can’t authenticate users.</p>

Honestly, the server is still fairly new’ish that’s why I asked. I was expecting like 300 to 400mb. But you make it seem like its 4-6 gigs[/quote]It’s 6Gb.  Anyway I’m out of ideas. Also mitb is the only one capable of doing the firewall/connection settings to allow it connection to the minecraft user authentication server. Also the 6Gb is the entire world folder I know the individual dimension is smaller but it’s still 1Gb.</p>
