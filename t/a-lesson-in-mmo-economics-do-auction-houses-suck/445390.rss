The same reason is why that shitty server corruptionX failed, people know nothing about the very basics of economics.</p>

It reminds me when the Grand Exchange was put it - it made the game dramatically more boring than not having the Grand Exchange.</p>
<p>Could Jagex possibly fix the economy by removing the Grand Exchange and reverting back to full player-based trading instead?<br>
[/quote]That’s what i meant when i said this was relevant the RS Economy.</p>
<p>The economy is already working, and doesn’t “need” fixing. It’s just a completely different system (see the article on Getter-economy). But i no doubt prefer the old system in every way. They could expand upon it much like SWG did, that would be optimal.[/quote]</p>
<p>Taking a look at the article, it shows that everything in SWG was player constructed, making certain items more sought after than others, kinda of like the drop system for bosses items work in RuneScape, however, I see where RuneScape’s personal flaw comes into play because there is a massive overflow of the individual items that create the ultimately sought after item, say godswords. Since plenty of people go out and boss regularly, these items are common regardless of their usual ‘rare’ quality. This causes their overall value to go down, JaGeX ruined the economy by fixating it, after they found stabilized numbers on running the G.E. a few months. This is where I think the economy for RuneScape is flawed. It is player controlled but to an extent where the players will never have complete freedom over what they wish to sell or buy, anymore.</p>
<p>Never ever use the auction house in WoW before though, I thought it was dumb.</p>
<p>I’m currently waiting to see how combat level is reworked in the game, I’m interested to see what happens. They’ll probably just add up all the combat skills to get a number instead of using a complicated algorithm. That update will effect the economy like never before, I expect it will, at least.</p>
