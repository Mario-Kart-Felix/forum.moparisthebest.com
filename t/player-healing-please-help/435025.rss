    <title>Player Healing - Please help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-healing-please-help/435025</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using DemonWars server and Client. And whenever a player logs into the server they health regeneration never stops. When you get hit you slowly regenerate your health one by one over time, but it doesn&#39;t stop at your level. If you have level 99HP you still regenerate health past that non-stop. How do I set a limit to this? I know the code would look something like this.
[code]
if (!(skillLevel[3] + 1 &gt; skillLevel[3]))
//heal
//else
//don&#39;t heal
[/code]
But I can&#39;t find the Health Regeneration. Can anybody help please?

The code I used above was improvised code I took from appendHit(). Since the regeneration is healing about 1 every 15-30 seconds I assumed it was like a ++ modifier.</description>

              <p>I edited by appendHP() method. I’ve yet to test it. But I’m using a 508 source, so I have no client.java. I’m going to just mess around in Player.Java until I get it. If this works, thank you for the help.</p>
<p>EDIT<br>
Well, It’s been over a minute. And my health hasn’t reached past 112. So thank you! it worked! I did have to do a small bit of rewriting the updateHP() method but it stopped the overhealing! thanks a bunch!</p>
<p>EDIT<br>
I spoke too soon… :’(</p>
