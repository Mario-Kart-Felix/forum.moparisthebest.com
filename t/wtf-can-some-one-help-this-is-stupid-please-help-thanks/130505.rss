    <description>wtf do i do?  :confused:

ok so i deleted a few npc&#39;s in the CFG folder (autospawn) then i changed like a general store person into an elf, and now i cant buy stuff of him, nothing at all happenes when i try to talk to him, i changed my food person from the staff seller (zaff) to the sandwich lady, how do i go about making the thing pop up.

Also how do i add a new object, do i just find portals, and just stick a new object there (in my client.java file) with coords (eveything else is that way so i think thats what i have to do) just making sure with u awsome coders out there, and if u could, add me on msn
