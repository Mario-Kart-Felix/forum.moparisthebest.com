    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/please-help-me-with-server-constant-server-crashing/117473</link>
    <description>I can&#39;t go 10 min without the server crashing tell me if I am doing anything wrong or tell me how i could fix the problem please. First thing i do is compile the server and run it with lamez&#39;s compiler. Then I log on and play/ help people then when i log out the server bascially crashes and people are forced off server. Another problem I have is people connecting to my server and the new server advertisement almost always says my server is offline either though I have like 3 people playing.  :| :| :confused: :| :|</description>
