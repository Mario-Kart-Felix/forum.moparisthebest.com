    <title>Portforwarding help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/portforwarding-help/322237</link>
    <description>If you need help with port forwarding, reply to this topic and I will try to help you.

This topic has been created to cut down on most of the help sections most related replies, there are more and more topics being created about port forwarding when there is a topic in the tutorial section providing help with port forwarding. Although every router has different settings people can easily make a mistake or forget to add something while forwarding a port.

I am offering Team Viewer assistance at a specific time of day, although I cannot promise I will be online, I will try my best though. This way the help section will cut down on all port forwarding topics. Please refer a member to this topic if they are asking for assistance of forwarding a port and report the topic to a moderator.

[b]Details[/b]
If you haven&#39;t already got Team Viewer you can download by clicking the following link:
http://teamviewer.com/index.aspx
Once installed successfully you can run the software, it will provide you with a ID and password, keep this for later use;

Now you are connected to Team viewer you can post your ID and password in this topic, the Team viewer must be online before anyone can connect.

[b]Time[/b]
I am normally at my computer from 4:00PM GMT - 4:00AM GMT (I know it&#39;s a long time, but I don&#39;t care).
If your moparscape account is online at that time, we will contact you via private message or MSN before we connect to your computer.
