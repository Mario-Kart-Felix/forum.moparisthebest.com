    <title>Alright, I have a few problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/alright-i-have-a-few-problems/28949</link>
    <description>Alright, number 1: I don&#39;t know how to get on.. &quot;Error Connecting to Server&quot;, any suggestions?
Number 2: Where do you find item codes, I&#39;d really like to know what codes to use to pick something up..
Number 3: Am I doing something wrong with the server? I&#39;m using ThundaScape, I put in name and pass, found a server, put in my username and pass on Mopar, and then IP. Then comes the &quot;Error Connecting to Server&quot;.. Anywho, any suggestions and help would be appreciated, thanks.</description>
