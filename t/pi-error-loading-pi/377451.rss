    <title>[PI] Error loading [PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-error-loading-pi/377451</link>
    <description>I found this new PI source and I thought I would make it my first project to enhance and code on it as I am new to this and want to learn.  However, when I go to load the client it gives me an error message.  It says &quot;Error Loading&quot;; I gave the source and client to my friend and he was able to get on the server successfully, but I wasn&#39;t.  Anyone help?</description>

              <p>That’s wierd that your friend could start up the client fine but you couldn’t, maybe the Cache didn’t download properly for you.</p>
<p>Only follow the below instructions if you Client downloads a Cache, if not don’t bother reading and i’m sorry I couldn’t resolve your problem.</p>
<p>So I advise downloading Dropbox, add the Cache to winrar and change it to ZIP then add to Dropbox, you will then get a link, go into Cachedownloader.java and search for this;</p>
<p>private String cacheLink = “Your Dropbox link here”; //</p>
<p>Change the link.</p>
<p>If all else fails, try placing your Cache into C: or just put it into the Client folder.</p>
