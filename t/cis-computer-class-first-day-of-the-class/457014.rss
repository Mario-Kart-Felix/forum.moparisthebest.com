    <title>CIS(Computer Class), First day of the class</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cis-computer-class-first-day-of-the-class/457014</link>
    <description>It started like an ordinary college course,  had a lecture bit and bytes, different internets like internet2,  speed internet, fiber optic cable etc... then we got to the socail networks, which leaded to gaming which leaded to an hour and a half discussion on World of Warcraft; which we all found out one of the instructors teaching the class plays it on the realm Fenris. 

This goes to show you that World of Warcraft is used for not only gaming but educational purposes.

Just thought I&#39;d share about my night tonight.</description>

<p>Well sounds like he’s not a dedicated teacher, more a dedicated nerd.<br>
[/quote]My psychology teacher was the same way. His way of teaching us about Freud was giving constant examples os sexual items… was sort of creepy/interesting both at the same time. (I know Freud was messed up but still… )[/quote]</p>
<p>Trying to convince anyone who listens that every young man deeply lusts to have sex with their mother? Then to kill their Father? Saying that all women are born sexually attracted to their mother? Did he happen to mention his views on these matters? I’d bet anything that your teacher condones this type of activity, lol.</p>
