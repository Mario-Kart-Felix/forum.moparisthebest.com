    <title>Server Donations - Payment Options</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-donations-payment-options/441744</link>
    <description>Well, as some of you may know, I&#39;ve been working pretty hard on a server, which I admitted, was partially for money. I&#39;m interested in actually creating a great server that&#39;s fun to play and performs well, but I&#39;m also very interested in a new computer and until I can get a job, this is the only way I see that being possible. Now, I&#39;m against selling items or really anything in-game, and want to host my server and have it live primarily off donations. But, I&#39;ve had problems with PayPal and heard a ton of bad things about them.

To any server owners out there, what should I do to accept donations? I let my friend use my PayPal account for donations, and it got limited within days (Although he was actually selling items). That&#39;s not a problem, as I have parents who have a lot of trust in me and see what I do and would gladly open up a PayPal account under their names (plus that way it&#39;s actually legal as I&#39;m only 17) and fill out additional identification information. I feel my best bet right now is to actually have one of my parents open a PayPal account, fill out everything, and just see how things go. I&#39;ve looked over PayPal&#39;s user agreements, and I don&#39;t see anything against donations. Seeing how this isn&#39;t a business and people would pay me out of their own generosity and/or maybe hopes of a primary hosting computer, I&#39;m also not selling virtual property.

What should I do? The only other option I know of that accepts PayPal is 2Checkout, but they require a business registration ID, which I cannot provide (But again, this isn&#39;t a business). Thanks in advance,

I didn’t mean it like that. Anyway, as long as you’re over 16 and you go to school, the Australian government pays you $200 a fortnight (assuming you don’t have a job). Perhaps you should take a look and see if there is a similar project in your country.</p>

              <p>Frig donations, what you want to do is open up a paypal business account, and when you open up a business account spend 3-5$ on a shopping Gimp/flash, and add that your website, so people can directly buy something off your website, and it will send to your paypal as a payment and not a donation, and just add on top of your website, a claim stating that all sales are final. No way they can charge back, because if they do, just show proof for paypal that they accepted your claims once they payed for it.</p>

<p>I’ve never had any problems with Paypal personally. If anything pops up, such as chargebacks, give them a call to the customer support line.

EDIT: The reason I said give them a call on their customer support line is that their online support is horrible imo. You’ll have a lot more luck calling in.</p>

<p>I had over 160$ (from selling rs accounts to gold sites and recovering) and I cant spend it.</p>
<p>Go with any site but them.</p>

I’ve never had any problems with Paypal personally. If anything pops up, such as chargebacks, give them a call to the customer support line. It happened to me once(50$ chargeback) and I lady I got in contact with was very nice and walked through it with me and I had the chargeback handled within an hour. Cost me nothing. Just be ready to supply proof of the item given.<br>
EDIT: The reason I said give them a call on their customer support line is that their online support is horrible imo. You’ll have a lot more luck calling in.<br>

I asked people on mopar about this and did what they said and used pp to receive some money via pp. Phoned up etc then they said they can’t do anything as they don’t do anything about virtual goods…[/quote]<br>
Well then the person you got in contact with is retarded.</p>

              <p>Well, as some of you may know, I’ve been working pretty hard on a server, which I admitted, was partially for money. I’m interested in actually creating a great server that’s fun to play and performs well, but I’m also very interested in a new computer and until I can get a job, this is the only way I see that being possible. Now, I’m against selling items or really anything in-game, and want to host my server and have it live primarily off donations. But, I’ve had problems with PayPal and heard a ton of bad things about them.</p>
<p>To any server owners out there, what should I do to accept donations? I let my friend use my PayPal account for donations, and it got limited within days (Although he was actually selling items). That’s not a problem, as I have parents who have a lot of trust in me and see what I do and would gladly open up a PayPal account under their names (plus that way it’s actually legal as I’m only 17) and fill out additional identification information. I feel my best bet right now is to actually have one of my parents open a PayPal account, fill out everything, and just see how things go. I’ve looked over PayPal’s user agreements, and I don’t see anything against donations. Seeing how this isn’t a business and people would pay me out of their own generosity and/or maybe hopes of a primary hosting computer, I’m also not selling virtual property.</p>
<p>What should I do? The only other option I know of that accepts PayPal is 2Checkout, but they require a business registration ID, which I cannot provide (But again, this isn’t a business). Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>~Lin</p>
