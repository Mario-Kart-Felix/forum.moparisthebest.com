    <description>Yes I&#39;ve made server and noone but me can connect to it it&#39;s been up a few days have had around like 30 people on today and all of sudden like noone none of my top players anyone can get on cept for me. I can get on their account seperatly but when they attempt to they can&#39;t get on! if anyone has any trouble shooting tips I can follow that&#39;d be really nice so I can get back to working on it and helping people.

Things I&#39;ve tried

1: dling a whole new source file &gt; failed

2: deleting my client.java file and having my friend give me his (he had the base client.java file for me from his own source unedited) 

3: checking all my ports turning em off and on.

4: turning my internet off and then back on then checking my port forwarding everything was in place..

And now I&#39;m out of ideas please need help A.S.A.P TY MUCH LOVE HOMIES</description>

              <p>Have you downloaded No-ip duc?</p>
<p>Have you port forwarded?</p>
<p>If you have a wireless modem, I suggest downloading utorrent.</p>
<p>Then once you have utorrent do this:</p>
<p>Options &gt; Preferences &gt; Connection</p>
<p>Make sure “Randomize port each connect” is ticked.</p>
<p>Then open your run.bat (Reason you open it now is because If you do below first, When you try to run the server is will say “server already in use.”)</p>
<p>Then on utorrent in the port box, whatever is in there, Change it to 43594, Or whatever your servers Port is 43594 is the most used port…</p>
<p>Then push Okay.</p>
<p>Next,</p>
<p>Options &gt; Speed Guide</p>
<p>Click “Test if port is forwarded properly”</p>
<p>It will redirect you to a page, Which will open your port!</p>
<p>Post if you have any problems.</p>
