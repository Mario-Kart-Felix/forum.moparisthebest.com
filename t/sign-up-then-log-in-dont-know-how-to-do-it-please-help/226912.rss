    <description>Hello people, I have server called Bass-Scape that is not realy big right now...
And a lot of people are logging in and then quitting 2 weeks later and i have all these files in the character folder and i don&#39;t know which ones are valid bass-scape players and which ones are 5 minute quitters. And so i heard that you can integrate your server. &quot;Bass&quot;ically, this means you have to sign up before you play and not just any random username or password. Anybody know how. BTW i haven&#39;t really tried because i have no idea like even where to start to do this. If one of the requirements is a website, i have that.</description>
