The Catholic Church is controlled by an old man, supported by other old men. While the European state-churches are govern by the government. For the others you could look them up. I simply doesn’t care about any denominations other than that, since they have no historical value.<br>

That’s what my Dad told me when I asked him 2 years ago.  I narrowed it down though, he gave a long talk about it.[/quote]</p>
<p>Christians SHOULD be strict about a lot of things. Our human nature won’t let us live a Godly life. Some of the greatest men in history have committed horrible, horrible sins (see: King David or King Solomon) They weren’t Christians but they did try to live a Godly life. It doesn’t mean God loves us less.</p>

<p>I do believe in a higher power who does not interfere with anything in our lives. I’ve also been finding Buddhism very fascinating and intend to study it more as its more about bettering yourself as a person, now a higher power.</p>

Well, I may get flamed and whatnot for this, but I do not belong to a religion. I believe that there is not a god. I believe that everything can be proven by science. I’m not sure if their is a certain name for it, but it’s just what I believe.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Isn’t that like Scientology?[/quote]</p>
<p>No, Scientology is basically the belief that Dianetics and other writings by L. Ron Hubbard in which a person is basically freeing themselves from their past. You can throw in brainwashing and taking as much money as they can if you wish to.</p>
<p>I think its safe to say your an atheist though.</p>

        <p>My religion of choice is… none! I don’t believe in any religion or religious scripture, I do not believe in any god either, or anything supernatural, I do not believe in anything that cannot be proven or disproved for that matter. That’s not to say that I’m saying no god exists, I am merely saying I don’t know and have absolutely no way of knowing therefore I do not hold the position that a god exists. You can call me an atheist if you like but so long as you also call me a non-stamp collector or a non-model train enthusiast.</p>
<p>In regards to my upbringing, I was born non-religious like everyone else on the planet into a largely non-religious household and country, where the most religious someone gets is counting themselves as a Christian due to it being culture or tradition despite not technically meeting the criteria for being a Christian, I only consider someone I meet in my country a Christian if they attend church weekly or make it known that they believe in the Christian god.</p>

<p>I quote from the bible:</p>
<p>Deuteronomy 34 10 Since then, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face<br>
Exodus 33 11 The Lord would speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his young aide Joshua son of Nun did not leave the tent.<br>
Exodus 33 18-20 Then Moses said, “Now show me your glory.” And the Lord said, “I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim my name, the Lord, in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. But,” he said, “you cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live.”<br>
Genesis 32 30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.</p>
<p>Matthew 27 5 So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.<br>
Acts 1 16-18 and said, “Brothers and sisters, the Scripture had to be fulfilled in which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through David concerning Judas, who served as guide for those who arrested Jesus. 17 He was one of our number and shared in our ministry.” (With the payment he received for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out.</p>

I am very similar to you. I was born into a Roman Catholic family and that’s what I am. I attend a private school which is Catholic.</p>
<p>I believe in it because I feel there is some kind of a greater being out there. I don’t believe in everything about being Catholic anymore, however. One of the head priests in my middle school took like nearly all the money the church had and gambled it. That’s when I lost some of my faith.<br>

That’s just losing faith in Roman Catholicism though, truly from my point of view, Christian is the way to heaven, doesn’t matter what denomination it is, as long as you believe Jesus is your savior, that’s all that matters.[/quote]There’s more to it than that broski.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Niall, post:24, topic:451436”]My religion of choice is… none! I don’t believe in any religion or religious scripture, I do not believe in any god either, or anything supernatural, I do not believe in anything that cannot be proven or disproved for that matter. That’s not to say that I’m saying no god exists, I am merely saying I don’t know and have absolutely no way of knowing therefore I do not hold the position that a god exists. You can call me an atheist if you like but so long as you also call me a non-stamp collector or a non-model train enthusiast.</p>
<p>In regards to my upbringing, I was born non-religious like everyone else on the planet into a largely non-religious household and country, where the most religious someone gets is counting themselves as a Christian due to it being culture or tradition despite not technically meeting the criteria for being a Christian, I only consider someone I meet in my country a Christian if they attend church weekly or make it known that they believe in the Christian god.</p>

<p>The following content in this post merely serves as educational material, nothing more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve yet to see any so-called biblical contradictions hold water</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I quote from the bible:</p>
<p>Deuteronomy 34 10 Since then, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face<br>
Exodus 33 11 The Lord would speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his young aide Joshua son of Nun did not leave the tent.<br>
Exodus 33 18-20 Then Moses said, “Now show me your glory.” And the Lord said, “I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim my name, the Lord, in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. But,” he said, “you cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live.”<br>
Genesis 32 30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.</p>
<p>Matthew 27 5 So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.<br>
Acts 1 16-18 and said, “Brothers and sisters, the Scripture had to be fulfilled in which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through David concerning Judas, who served as guide for those who arrested Jesus. 17 He was one of our number and shared in our ministry.” (With the payment he received for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out.</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>Isn’t that like Scientology?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Scientology has nothing to do with science and the namesake Scientology likely came about from the term Science Fiction or SciFi, due to how the nature of Scientology isn’t too dissimilar to science fiction writings.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m no good in fixing quotes up so I’ll just type it out lol.</p>
<p>There’s a 3 fold nature of God. No man has seen “The Father”. Only Christ has revealed Himself to mankind since the beginning and is the mediator between the Father and mankind. It goes waaay deep and unless you’re actually interested in hearing me out, I’ll refuse to post a tl;tr post. I’ve done it a few times and learned my lesson lol.</p>
<p>Not sure what Judas has to do with any contradiction you’re trying to form though. O_o</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very similar to you. I was born into a Roman Catholic family and that’s what I am. I attend a private school which is Catholic.</p>
<p>I believe in it because I feel there is some kind of a greater being out there. I don’t believe in everything about being Catholic anymore, however. One of the head priests in my middle school took like nearly all the money the church had and gambled it. That’s when I lost some of my faith.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s just losing faith in Roman Catholicism though, truly from my point of view, Christian is the way to heaven, doesn’t matter what denomination it is, as long as you believe Jesus is your savior, that’s all that matters.<br>
[/quote]There’s more to it than that broski.<br>
[/quote]God never intended or wanted there to be more than one denomination. He said when the end times are near that the denominations will unite and be one.</p>
<p>I am a theist, I really don’t know what’s out there, but I think the bible is very interesting.[/quote]</p>
<p>You’re right about God never wanting there to be denominations. God is about unity and peace, not separation.</p>
<p>However, God does outline that there will be a falling away. Only those who truly stand for Christ will unite. I’m glad you find it interesting…  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Hebrews 3:15<br>
While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</p>
<p>One thing I’d like to add. The bible is relevant until the end of time. All prophecies have/will come to pass. It’s one of the main reasons I turned my life over to God.</p>
<p>Realization that God is right.</p>
<p>Realization that He exists and I am an enemy of God.</p>
<p>My heart is open and willing to change, knowing I need it.</p>
<p>God calls out to me.</p>
<p>You get the picture. God destroys the prideful, and lifts up the humble. If you’re serious about seeking truth, you’ll find Him (although He isn’t far from any of us)</p>

        <p>Atheist. I believe that going to church, religious private schools etc is a form of brain washing. I don’t think its right for people to tell you what to believe and what is right from wrong. If there was a God he would not care what you believed in or your actions because he did create you. If he makes everything then the stuff you do/believe would be a result of him am i right? I think people should believe whatever they want to believe, not stick to one certain religion. Go off what THEY believe is right and wrong.</p>

<p>Don’t be ignorant and insult others customs. You made the choice to be free of religion, but insulting someone who has chosen to follow a tradition.<br>
(Exclude children in this, because we all know its not fair to really force unknowing children to do something-that I don’t like)</p>
