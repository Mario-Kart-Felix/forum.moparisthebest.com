    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/post-your-religion-of-choice-and-why/451436</link>
    <description>Since there&#39;s so many debates about religion and all that, I wanted to start a topic about what your religion is and what made you have faith in this religion.


I&#39;m a born Catholic.  My parents raised me as a Roman Catholic and took me to church every Sunday to learn the ways of God.  I had my First Communion, and was confirmed by St. Thomas Catholic church when I was 15.  My parents have always had certain beliefs about certain situations, but it was always the Catholic way to them.  Personally, I believe that there is something out there, my background forces me to believe it&#39;s God, but I do know that there is something whom created us all.



Please do not start debates on which religion is better, and please do not bash on other religions no matter the circumstances.

Post your religion here, and maybe an explanation if it is not common, and post what made you believe in this sort of religion.</description>

Exodus 33 11 The Lord would speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his young aide Joshua son of Nun did not leave the tent.<br>
Exodus 33 18-20 Then Moses said, “Now show me your glory.” And the Lord said, “I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim my name, the Lord, in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. But,” he said, “you cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live.”<br>
Genesis 32 30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.</p>
<p>Matthew 27 5 So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.<br>
Acts 1 16-18 and said, “Brothers and sisters, the Scripture had to be fulfilled in which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through David concerning Judas, who served as guide for those who arrested Jesus. 17 He was one of our number and shared in our ministry.” (With the payment he received for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out.</p>

<p>I’m no good in fixing quotes up so I’ll just type it out lol.</p>
<p>There’s a 3 fold nature of God. No man has seen “The Father”. Only Christ has revealed Himself to mankind since the beginning and is the mediator between the Father and mankind. It goes waaay deep and unless you’re actually interested in hearing me out, I’ll refuse to post a tl;tr post. I’ve done it a few times and learned my lesson lol.</p>
<p>Not sure what Judas has to do with any contradiction you’re trying to form though. O_o</p>

<p>You’re right about God never wanting there to be denominations. God is about unity and peace, not separation.</p>
<p>However, God does outline that there will be a falling away. Only those who truly stand for Christ will unite. I’m glad you find it interesting…  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Hebrews 3:15<br>
While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</p>
<p>One thing I’d like to add. The bible is relevant until the end of time. All prophecies have/will come to pass. It’s one of the main reasons I turned my life over to God.</p>
<p>Realization that God is right.</p>
<p>Realization that He exists and I am an enemy of God.</p>
<p>My heart is open and willing to change, knowing I need it.</p>
<p>God calls out to me.</p>
<p>You get the picture. God destroys the prideful, and lifts up the humble. If you’re serious about seeking truth, you’ll find Him (although He isn’t far from any of us)</p>

Isn’t that like Scientology?[/quote]</p>
<p>No, Scientology is basically the belief that Dianetics and other writings by L. Ron Hubbard in which a person is basically freeing themselves from their past. You can throw in brainwashing and taking as much money as they can if you wish to.</p>
<p>I think its safe to say your an atheist though.</p>

<p>Christians SHOULD be strict about a lot of things. Our human nature won’t let us live a Godly life. Some of the greatest men in history have committed horrible, horrible sins (see: King David or King Solomon) They weren’t Christians but they did try to live a Godly life. It doesn’t mean God loves us less.</p>

<p>I’m an atheist, and there is two reasons that I see as sufficient justification.</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no evidence.</li>
<li>Religious people say that we doesn’t fit God’s standard. But what I’m seeing is that gods doesn’t fit our standards. We the people are the force of good and evil in the world, not God and Satan. I doesn’t see this world as a product of a just god, and I can see the reasons for evil, I can’t blame Satan for that.</li>

              <p>I’m a Christian. I’m not the “stereotypical” Christian. I guess the stereotype would be someone who goes to church, listens to a priest and goes home. I’m not about that.</p>
<p>Let me first start off by saying (cus this’ll bother me when i write about it), I don’t go to Church. I am part of the Church. Many people believe that Church is the building, but according to the bible, that isn’t true. The Church is the group of Christians. Whenever I go to “church”, I say I am going to meeting. But for the sake of this post and readability I’ll just call it church.</p>
<p>Sunday morning, there is no priest, there is no clergy, there is no altar, there is no pastor, etc. Everyone is gathered around a table with a loaf of bread and a cup of wine. We sing and pray, and then a Brother - a male who is eating at the Lord’s Supper - led by the Holy Spirit, prays over the Bread and Wine, and then passes it around to all of the brothers and sisters - others who are eating at the Lord’s Supper - who eat a piece of bread and take a sip of wine. Then we go off and have sunday school etc.</p>
<p>We have other meetings and stuff during the week too.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a certain denomination or title, I guess you could say I am a branch off of the Plymouth Brethren. Here is my church’s website, <a href="http://www.gospelhallch.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.gospelhallch.com</a> &lt;-- My dad made it.</p>

I am very similar to you. I was born into a Roman Catholic family and that’s what I am. I attend a private school which is Catholic.</p>
<p>I believe in it because I feel there is some kind of a greater being out there. I don’t believe in everything about being Catholic anymore, however. One of the head priests in my middle school took like nearly all the money the church had and gambled it. That’s when I lost some of my faith.<br>
[/quote]<br>
That’s just losing faith in Roman Catholicism though, truly from my point of view, Christian is the way to heaven, doesn’t matter what denomination it is, as long as you believe Jesus is your savior, that’s all that matters.[/quote]</p>
<p>I truly don’t know much of the difference between Catholics and Christians.</p>

<p>And for people who believe science has all the answers, I agree with you to a certain point. Some things just can’t be explained, like why certain things were created and how they happen.</p>

              <p>[quote=“marcbob, post:2, topic:451436”]I am very similar to you. I was born into a Roman Catholic family and that’s what I am. I attend a private school which is Catholic.</p>
<p>I believe in it because I feel there is some kind of a greater being out there. I don’t believe in everything about being Catholic anymore, however. One of the head priests in my middle school took like nearly all the money the church had and gambled it. That’s when I lost some of my faith.[/quote]<br>
That’s just losing faith in Roman Catholicism though, truly from my point of view, Christian is the way to heaven, doesn’t matter what denomination it is, as long as you believe Jesus is your savior, that’s all that matters.</p>

Well, I may get flamed and whatnot for this, but I do not belong to a religion. I believe that there is not a god. I believe that everything can be proven by science. I’m not sure if their is a certain name for it, but it’s just what I believe.<br>

Isn’t that like Scientology?[/quote]<br>
Not sure. Never really looked it up.</p>

<p>Atheist, I believe.  Hopefully nobody flames lol.</p>
<p>But yeah what you guys said, I also experienced something similar.  It’s something that you can not explain, no matter how hard you try.</p>
