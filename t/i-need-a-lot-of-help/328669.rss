    <title>I need a lot of help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-a-lot-of-help/328669</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to make a server/client/whathaveyou,  and I&#39;m not doing a very good job.
I&#39;m running into a lot of problems.

1) When I hit &quot;run&quot; on it, I get the message:
&quot;The system could not find the path specified.
Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.noclassdeffounderror: net/com/canownueasy/Server ....&quot; and a lot more Java stuff

2) Sometimes I get the &quot;Java is not recognized as a internal or external source&quot; Or something like that, I don&#39;t remember exactly what it says.


PLEASE, if anyone could help, I&#39;d be EXTREMELY greatful.
thanks :)</description>
