    <title>I need a lot of help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-a-lot-of-help/510006</link>
    <description>I&#39;m pretty much a first time poster, well this would be my fourth post or something.
But I&#39;m really new to this and need some help. Everyone has to start somewhere.

Okay, well I downloaded the ZenithScape and Zenith client at here http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,555776.0.html .

What my problem is, is that I just do not know what to do. I have read through that thread and tried ways to get it to work, but I just don&#39;t know what to do.
When I compile the server, it says the path is not specified and then says it has finished compiling the folders and stuff.
Once I run the server, then try connect with the client, I get stuck on &quot;Checking for updates %1&quot;. Can someone help me?
I also wish to play the server on LAN with a few friends, could someone help me with that also?</description>
