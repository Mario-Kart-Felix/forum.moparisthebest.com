    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-cant-turn-on-my-private-server/217040</link>
    <description> :confused: my friend he gave me his private server and he gave me a program called no-ip. i do not know what its for. i guess it has nothing to do with this problem but anyways he gave me the files for the private server and i extracted them and i clicked the runner. but it says open on port 43594, so when i try to log in it says &quot;error connecting to server&quot;. someone please help me with this problem

p.s. im using a wireless laptop with vista if that has anything to do with it</description>

<p>You have got to keep Run.bat open,try using the IP 127.0.0.1 and tell me if it works.You also may want to try port forwarding,do you connect to your own network or someone Else’s network.You can contact me if you need more help.</p>
