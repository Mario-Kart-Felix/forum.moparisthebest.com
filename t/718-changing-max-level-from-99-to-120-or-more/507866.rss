    <title>[718]Changing max level from 99 to 120 or more</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-changing-max-level-from-99-to-120-or-more/507866</link>
    <description>Just wondering how it would be possible? I went to getLevelForXp and changed max level to 120. Well it didn&#39;t quite seem to work since I got levels like defence 120/99. In client reminder xp also was removed (like if it was 99) and it only showed current xp. Not sure if its server or client that has to be fixed. Any ideas?</description>
