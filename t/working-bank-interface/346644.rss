    <description>Can anyone give me the working bank interface.
When playing, You can type in &quot;Full -1 5292&quot; and will open a bank interface but its just the window and not the actual players bank. Can someone please tell me the code for the players actual working interface? I know there is one because I had it once but have forgotten it.
Thank you.</description>
