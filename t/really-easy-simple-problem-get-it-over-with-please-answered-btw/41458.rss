    <description>How do I make my person an admin?
It was working just going into files and changing...but now whenever i do that, it changes back i&#39;ve even went into client.java and put

if (playerID = &quot;Jonathan&quot;) {
playerRight = 3 ;
}
and failed (didn&#39;t compile right)</description>

              <p>Go to the tutorials section.  That code isnt right at all. it should be like <code>if (playerName.equalsIgnoreCase("Sir Green"))
				{
					playerRights = 3; </code>.  Don’t put that as the last one, because if you do, you need an extra } in there.  Just put that somewhere in the middle, and change the Sir Green to Jonathan</p>
