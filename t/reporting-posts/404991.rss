    <description>Hi.

I was just wondering, when should you really report posts to a moderator with being a brown-nosing, wannabe-mod snitch?

Obviously, posts that are a blatant attempt at spreading something malicious should be reported straight away. Every other legit report, in my opinion, helps clean up the spammers etc., so the people know what&#39;s and what&#39;s not acceptable.

I believe it&#39;s quite important to report even the minor things, to help build the &quot;atmosphere&quot;, so to speak, of the community. This then makes the whole experience that little bit better for [i]everyone[/i].

I realise too, that maybe some administrators don&#39;t really care for the little things, so long as there is a relatively respectful forum at present.

Although there are rules, there&#39;s always going to be grey areas, so here&#39;s the chance to discuss it.

What do you think?</description>

This is why I created the thread, to try and distinguish the point where you it’s unnecessary to report spam, even if it was innocent and harmless.</p>
<p>There’s always a time and place for everything. If someone creates one of those “banter threads”, then fine, but what if someone posts a tutorial of some sort and you decide to use the same banter to one of your friends posting on the thread, that shows total disregard to the topic at hand.</p>
<p>Should they not be reported and action taken against them then? Even <span class="bbcode-i">if</span> it was just about “having a laugh”.</p>

Precisely. So what if something was reported that you deemed petty and annoying that someone would report that, but the reporter deemed it unnecessary for whatever reason? You would think they are looking for something to report whereas the reporter had a genuine reason.</p>
<p>This is where things get twisted and people start to make judgements, resulting in false projections of people.</p>
<p>Like for instance, all this “what the fuck is there to think about” may seem stupid to you, but I truly think at least an effort of a discussion would be good/useful to some people reading this.</p>
<p>Another example, I wouldn’t want to be portrayed as something negative for posting a topic like this, as I think people getting the true image of who you really are is important.[/quote]</p>
<p>Not unless it’s a repeated ‘offense’, if you will. Otherwise I’ll just close it and think nothing more.</p>

Precisely. So what if something was reported that you deemed petty and annoying that someone would report that, but the reporter deemed it unnecessary for whatever reason? You would think they are looking for something to report whereas the reporter had a genuine reason.[/quote]<br>
When I was a mod, I never dismissed a report without solving it unless it was blatantly retarded.  Usually, I would just ignore it, and let another mod deal with it.</p>

<p>This is where things get twisted and people start to make judgements, resulting in false projections of people.</p>
<p>Like for instance, all this “what the fuck is there to think about” may seem stupid to you, but I truly think at least an effort of a discussion would be good/useful to some people reading this.</p>
<p>Another example, I wouldn’t want to be portrayed as something negative for posting a topic like this, as I think people getting the true image of who you really are is important.</p>

<p>When someone is harmlessly having a laugh with another forum-er, and in effect still spamming, should they still be reported for derailing/trolling/having a laugh.</p>

              <p>I’m probably going to report this topic because it’s going to turn into a spam war. If a rule is broken, take action. I don’t always type the same thing, even if it’s the same issue. Example<br>
“Wrong section”<br>
“section = wrong”</p>
<p>Or sometimes it’s something clever that relates to the failure OP, because of advertising, etc.</p>

              <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I was just wondering, when should you really report posts to a moderator with being a brown-nosing, wannabe-mod snitch?</p>
<p>Obviously, posts that are a blatant attempt at spreading something malicious should be reported straight away. Every other legit report, in my opinion, helps clean up the spammers etc., so the people know what’s and what’s not acceptable.</p>
<p>I believe it’s quite important to report even the minor things, to help build the “atmosphere”, so to speak, of the community. This then makes the whole experience that little bit better for <span class="bbcode-i">everyone</span>.</p>
<p>I realise too, that maybe some administrators don’t really care for the little things, so long as there is a relatively respectful forum at present.</p>
<p>Although there are rules, there’s always going to be grey areas, so here’s the chance to discuss it.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
