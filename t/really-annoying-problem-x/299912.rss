    <title>=&#39;( Really annoying problem..X&#39;(</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/really-annoying-problem-x/299912</link>
    <description>Well, I searched, and searched, and tried, and tried, over and over again, for 3 weeks now, and nothing..so this is my last option, and I don&#39;t got a lot of confidence this is going to help, or if anyone knows how to fix, or if it is even possible..=/

Well, lets get to the point!

As some of you may know about the Pwnscape 3 - Delta source, the Make-Over-Mage interface sucks! (Interface ID = 3559).
So what I am asking is, does anyone know how to fix the glitch where when you change a color the client crashes? I am not sure if it is server side, or client side. I am using both client, and server, from the previous owner. Also if this may help, below i have added what the error states in the clients DOS box, when it crashes. (Freezes)

Exception in thread &quot;Thread-8&quot; java.lang.NullPointerException
        at Class30_Sub2_Sub4_Sub6.method476(Class30_Sub2_Sub4_Sub6.java:1253)
        at client.method75(client.java:6410)
        at client.method105(client.java:9772)
        at client.method112(client.java:10498)
        at client.method146(client.java:13997)
        at client.method102(client.java:9229)
        at client.method9(client.java:10422)
        at Applet_Sub1.run(Applet_Sub1.java:127)
        at client.run(client.java:5359)
        at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)
[/code]

Tip that might help:

I think this problem can be caused by the interface ID, so I think I need to get into the interfaces internal code. Only problem is, i don&#39;t know the location. Anyone know where it is? (I think it is a case in client.java server side.)

Guys please,  this is a serious matter and it is really irritating when people say unneeded things. If you do I am not going to respond, really not in the mood for that stuff. Also if someone is doing that, all the other mature people, please don&#39;t respond to that either and crash this post by making it a huge, unneeded fight.

Thanks and I will really appreciate the help. =) 

EDIT: Keep this in mind: 

[code]at Class30_Sub2_Sub4_Sub6.method476(Class30_Sub2_Sub4_Sub6.java:1253)[/code]

And in there, I found the method:

[code]    public void method476(int i, int j)
    {
        for(int k = 0; k &lt; anInt1630; k++)
            if(anIntArray1640[k] == i)
                anIntArray1640[k] = j;

    }
[/code]

So does this do anything? =/ I am not good with clients.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 03, 2009, 06:41:46 pm[/size][hr]Nvm Fixed =DDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</description>
