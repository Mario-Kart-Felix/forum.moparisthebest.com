    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fences-java/346399</link>
    <description>I wrote up this simple java file for those who will use it.

--EDIT--

This is for advanced coders only, unless you can figure the little error out.  If you can figure the error out, you are worthy enough to use this.


Here&#39;s the snippet:

[code]
import java.io.*;
public class Fences {
	public static int fences[] = {2086,9027,9028,9029,9299,9300,13450,13453,13454};
	public static int gates[] = {37,38,39,47,48,49,50,52,53,89,90,94,95,166,167,190,1551,1552,1553,1554,
				     1555,1556,1557,1558,1559,1560,1561,1589,1590,1596,1597,1598,1599,2039,
				     2041,2050,2051,2058,2060,2154,2155,2199,2200,2255,2256,2259,2260,2261,2262,
				     2307,2308,2391,2392,2394,2432,2433,2438,2439,2552,2553,2607,2608,2623,2664,
				     2665,2673,2674,2685,2686,2687,2688};

	public static int heightA[] = {0,1};
}
[/code]


Let me explain this for those who do not understand that much.


These are object ID&#39;S for fences and gates, they are all X1, Y1, Height 0 or 1.




If you have enough potential you can make this work to your advantage, say making it so players can only shoot monsters through gates and fences.  This can be simply done by adding a method reading if the player is using magic or ranged.  If you isolate these two methods, you can easily make a quick statement saying that if the object is now a fence or a gate, the player will not be able to attack using range, mage or melee.


For those who say this isn&#39;t development, it actually is.  This is a step closer to stopping anti-clipping in servers.</description>

<p>I indeed did this, also to Mapristhebest…</p>
<p>I didn’t finish the arrays off simply because not every server uses all the areas.  In fact, in most servers, if you were to walk to lumbridge, falador, camelot, ardougne, castlewars, any of those, there is nothing there.  So I just decided to put object ID’S that servers would have some type of action around.</p>
<p>There is a reason why I did make a fences.java file, simply because I didn’t want to start pulling ID’S out of arrays in other files.  If I were to do the arrays in client.java there would be a moment of mass lag for the player when they visit a new area.</p>
<p>My server starts up and loads files one at a time, so like on Hyperion, my server will load folders, then different config files.  The fences.java was just a way to ease the lag a bit.</p>

              <p>This is the type of thing that should only ever be loaded from a configuration file or database, there is no reason to hardcode arrays like this EVER.  Also there is no error checking, if one of those arrays aren’t the right size the code will throw an exception and the server will shut down.</p>
<p>In short, no one should ever use this, and instead should write a class to dynamically load these values from storage AND check them for errors.</p>

<p>Agreeing with what you said, I manipulated the client and created a code that offers clipping through NPC following players and other NPC’s.  It wasn’t easy, but it wasn’t hard.  It was more of something I enjoyed…Perhaps I should just release the full fences.JAVA, the one that I have, with the walkable method.</p>

<p>I wrote it up, and yes it is a useless import, that was to stop people with little knowledge from using the code.  There are simpler ways of doing this, but when you can import arrays into a method and state, something like</p>
<p>if(fenceExists() &amp;&amp; AtkType &gt; 0){<br>
resetAttack();<br>
}</p>
<p>This is the exact same code I use in my server, it works perfectly.  Now all you need to do is make the void for existing fences.  It is easy and with some knowledge, can be done in a matter of 20 minutes?</p>

<p>Dude, I don’t mean to be rude…but this is for NPC’S and PLAYERS.  This is not the full code of course, this is the list of id’s for areas that have fences that are used in RSPS’S.  Places like, Lumbridge’s fences by the bridge, Faladors fence by the garden area, stuff like that.  I might release a full list, but like I said, this is for combat making it so if theres like a wall of a building, players won’t shoot through it…Not so they run around it…</p>

honestly if he releases this, then most likely he has the full thing on his server, and just removed some.<br>
Also, I might actually use this, I cba to find the Id’s before, and you’ve found them for me. thanks.</p>

              <p>I wrote up this simple java file for those who will use it.</p>
<p>–EDIT–</p>
<p>This is for advanced coders only, unless you can figure the little error out.  If you can figure the error out, you are worthy enough to use this.</p>
<p>Here’s the snippet:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">import java.io.*;
public class Fences {
	public static int fences[] = {2086,9027,9028,9029,9299,9300,13450,13453,13454};
	public static int gates[] = {37,38,39,47,48,49,50,52,53,89,90,94,95,166,167,190,1551,1552,1553,1554,
				     1555,1556,1557,1558,1559,1560,1561,1589,1590,1596,1597,1598,1599,2039,
				     2041,2050,2051,2058,2060,2154,2155,2199,2200,2255,2256,2259,2260,2261,2262,
				     2307,2308,2391,2392,2394,2432,2433,2438,2439,2552,2553,2607,2608,2623,2664,
				     2665,2673,2674,2685,2686,2687,2688};

	public static int heightA[] = {0,1};
}</code></pre>
<p>Let me explain this for those who do not understand that much.</p>
<p>These are object ID’S for fences and gates, they are all X1, Y1, Height 0 or 1.</p>
<p>If you have enough potential you can make this work to your advantage, say making it so players can only shoot monsters through gates and fences.  This can be simply done by adding a method reading if the player is using magic or ranged.  If you isolate these two methods, you can easily make a quick statement saying that if the object is now a fence or a gate, the player will not be able to attack using range, mage or melee.</p>
<p>For those who say this isn’t development, it actually is.  This is a step closer to stopping anti-clipping in servers.</p>
