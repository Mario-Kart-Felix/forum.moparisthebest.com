    <description>Hi,

I&#39;m using a Vote System off a site I can&#39;t mention, and it&#39;s having a bug. When people vote and then wait 24 hours, it doesn&#39;t delete their query from the database after 24 hours. It should though as I see it&#39;s supposed to, but it&#39;s not. 

Here is the code:

[code]$sql = mysql_query(&quot;SELECT * FROM `votes`&quot;);
if (mysql_num_rows($sql) &gt; 0) {
	while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($sql)) {
		if ((time() - $row[&#39;time&#39;]) &gt; strtotime(&quot;+1 day&quot;, $row[&#39;time&#39;])) {
			mysql_query(&quot;DELETE FROM `votes` WHERE `authcode` = &#39;&quot; . $row[&#39;authcode&#39;] . &quot;&#39;&quot;);
		}
	}
}[/code]

If anyone could help me with this, it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.</description>
