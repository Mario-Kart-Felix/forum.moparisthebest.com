    <title>MoparScape client opens, loads a tiny bit, then exits (more info inside)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparscape-client-opens-loads-a-tiny-bit-then-exits-more-info-inside/280174</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve recently had a craving to start playing MoparScape once again, and I was excited to do so.
However, I downloaded the regular MoparScape client (3.2 w/Aryan) and the same thing happens every time, no matter how much I delete and re-install.
I open it, the black screen (Running Bot) stays empty, the client loads but stays at &quot;Starting Up&quot; until it finally closes and goes to the Running Bot, which says &quot;press any key to continue&quot;, which just closes the Running bot.

I know this is probably on this website a million times, but I truthfully used the search engine and couldn&#39;t find anything at all, so I&#39;m very sorry about that.

Does anybody know how I can finally solve this problem? I use Windows XP, and all the MoparScape files are saved in a folder called MoparScape on my desktop, which I doubt changes anything.

Thank you in advanced! :)[br][br][size=1]Posted on: May 28, 2009, 05:03:21 pm[/size][hr] :|.............. Bump</description>
