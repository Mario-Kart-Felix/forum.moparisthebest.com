    <description>Okay guys so im a newbie coding PI - eco-pkscape i think and i wanted to add a custom dice thing.
heres what i would like to know if it is possible.

if when i type ::rolldice which i have already added and the emote of rolling a dice appears but i want to know if it can force a random number from 1 - 100 when i type it but im not sure how.
this is my code at the moment:

if (playerCommand.equals(&quot;rolldice&quot;) &amp;&amp; (c.playerRights &gt;= 0)) {
			c.sendMessage(&quot;You roll the dice&quot;);
			c.startAnimation(11900);
		}

if you understand what i mean by forcing the text to say a random number from 1 - 100 please re-write this code or tell me how to put it in. 

:3 its probably really simple but im used to coding 317&#39;s and i have stayed away from RSPS&#39;s for quite awhile :P

Thanks.</description>
