    <title>Chrome-Isle</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/chrome-isle/512353</link>
    <description>I currently have a server named Chrome-Isle with a player base of around 20-25 daily. However I am unhappy with the base I used to create Chrome-Isle as it has VERY bad stability and I have done everything I can to fix it. I am looking to re-start the project with a much more stable source, whilst chrome-isle will still be online and available to play we will be creating a whole new experience for the players.

I have a VPS and a domain paid for.

I&#39;m looking for highly experienced programmers who know java very well.

For more info add my skype : Swake_melty


Thank-you.</description>
