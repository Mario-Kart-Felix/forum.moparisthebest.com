    <title>Someone please tell CumeScape that his site is a CMS, please!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/someone-please-tell-cumescape-that-his-site-is-a-cms-please/266527</link>
    <description>K so basically, me and cumscape got into a argument over something stupid. He says his site , zyberscape, is not a cms site (custom by him btw) when it actually is, you can sign up on his site, make a thread, and even edit it, which entirely declares his forum as a cms.

Okay, 8 times out of 10 most kids on this site will say coding is not the same as programming, actually it is. What I really want to say is [url=http://zyberscape.com/thread.php?c=1&amp;f=3&amp;t=98&amp;goto=1]zyberscape[/url] is a cms! And I got the evidence to proove it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A content management system (CMS or Web CMS) is content management system (CMS) software, [b]usually implemented as a Web application, for creating and managing HTML content.[/b] It is used to manage and control a large, dynamic collection of Web material (HTML documents and their associated images). A CMS facilitates content creation, content control, editing, and many essential Web maintenance functions.
[b]Most systems use a database to store content[/b], metadata, and/or artifacts that might be needed by the system. Content is frequently, but not universally, stored as XML, to facilitate reuse and enable flexible presentation options.

[b]Administration is typically done through browser-based interfaces, but some systems require the use of a fat client.[/b]

Unlike Web-site builders like Microsoft FrontPage or [b]Adobe Dreamweaver[/b], a [b]CMS allows non-technical users to make changes to an existing website with little or no training[/b]. A [b]CMS typically [sub]requires an experienced coder to set up and add features[/sub], but is primarily a Web-site maintenance tool for non-technical administrators.[/b]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The CMS fully automates the publishing of your site&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ok, so if your a person that actually knows what a cms is, you should and would know that this is a CMS! Now tell cumscape his website is a cms, cuz he thinks its not. Its wierd how he knows what CMS mean, but not knowing what the purpose of it is...</description>
