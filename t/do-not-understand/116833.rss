    <title>Do not understand</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/do-not-understand/116833</link>
    <description>For some reason, when I try to load the MoparScape web client, it wont let me. It comes up with some page that says &quot;Error Loading RuneScape.&quot;

Also, when I try to log into a server that is up 100% of the time, it won&#39;t let me, it says it is down. 

I need to know how to log into a server that includes other players, and also where I can post a topic where I can talk about my ideas for a Machima, (sort of like Red Vs Blue), and ask for other, more experienced programmer&#39;s help in the matter.</description>

<p>The server status page updates ever 30 min so it could have just gone offline and it wont be posted offline yet.</p>
