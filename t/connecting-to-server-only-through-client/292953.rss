    <title>Connecting to server only through client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connecting-to-server-only-through-client/292953</link>
    <description>I tried to do the tutorial, but for some reason it was already implemented into Ddsspeced v2, so I enabled the code.  It didnt work at all, but when I changed the UID in the client.java on the server to &gt;= 1, it worked.  Anyone help?  (Add my MSN if you cant speak here).</description>
