    <title>Apollo | Something I did while I was bored</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/apollo-something-i-did-while-i-was-bored/529821</link>
    <description>I did this out of pure boredom, started last night and finished today when I got bored of it.

I didn&#39;t really do much, this is based off of the Apollo version that Major- put on Github (it had like bug fixes and stuff)

This is the changelog:

[code]
	ChatEventDecoder fix
	Player region changing fix
	Walking height level fix
	ThirdObjectActionEvent fix
	Combat level formula fix
	Item equipping fix
	2-handed weapon equip fix
	SwitchItemEventDecoder fix
	SetInterfaceTextEventencoder fix
	317 packet length fixes.
	Archive decoding fix
	Updated all assets to their newest version
	Removed multi revision support
	Removed JRuby scripting
	Replaced XML parsing with json
	Rewrote some of the JRuby core, translated to Java.[/code]

Yeah, I removed the JRuby scripting. Have a problem with it? Kiss my ass. I was going to implement another plugin language but didn&#39;t feel like writing the implementation. So I just converted the Ruby core to Java.

Lets see.. what else, I removed the multi-revision support, because fudge that, bug fixes.. yada yada, I converted the XML parsing to Json, I personally prefer Json because it&#39;s &gt; *

Yeah, so uh, have fun.
