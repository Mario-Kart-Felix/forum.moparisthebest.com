    <title>Using Telnet on WinXP Home? (Please reply)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/using-telnet-on-winxp-home-please-reply/9474</link>
    <description>I have two computers, and I want to be able to run commands from one to the other by connection through Telnet. One of my computers is XP MCE (very similar to XP Pro), and the other is XP Home. The one with XP MCE obviously has the telnet service, but Home doesn&#39;t. Is there anything I can download that will add the Telnet service to XP Home, or at leaste add another service that will work to send commands (command prompt).

Please let me know, I really need this.</description>
