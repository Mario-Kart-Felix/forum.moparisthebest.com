    <description>Ok, i have another problem..xD im a problematic person or so it appears lol.
Well i&#39;ve been trying to get people to post on the site and everything but they wont REALY benifit from it too much, so they dont post.. so i thought perhaps i would make members only items.. but i dont know how to lol.
I&#39;ve tried one TuT but it made no sence to me and i cudn&#39;t follow it properly... so i&#39;d like for someone to either help me out or add me on msn and help me on there..
