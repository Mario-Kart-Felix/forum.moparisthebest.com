    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-little-song-i-wrote/17223</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been waiting (waiting...)
I&#39;ve been killing (killing...)
I&#39;ve been sleeping(on the ground...)
And I&#39;ve died...
ONLY FOR YOU!!!!

[Chorus:]
DOES..THIS..SEEM..FAIR?
To constantly waste my life
I&#39;ve been waiting...
I&#39;ve been dying...
ONLY FOR YOU!!!
It&#39;s not fair that I must,
Haul my ass back and forth to you.
I don&#39;t deserve this bullshit.
I DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON&#39;T!!!!
[End Chorus]

No more...
I won&#39;t take it...
I&#39;m not gonna ridicule myself.
ONLY FOR YOU!!!

[Chorus]

Now you can do this yourself...
I&#39;m not taking this shit...
ANYMORE!!!!

(Guitar Solo)

You could go and die...
AND I WONT GIVE A FUCK!!

BECAUSE... IT&#39;S... YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOU!!!!

I was thinking &quot;Only for you&quot;</description>

<p>Yeah I agree, but most of the ‘kids’/teenagers like to hear swears in songs, so they have a lot of swears in songs lol.</p>

              <p>Pretty couragous to post something you wrote. I don’t think I’d have the balls to do that.</p>
<p>If you want my advice I would say first write the music, and then lyrics to go with it. I don’t feel a meaning from it other then someone did you harm. 7/10 on lyrics because they aren’t bad. Maybe short though.</p>
