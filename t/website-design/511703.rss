              <p>I’d get rid of all of the ‘Indigos’ behind the navigation bar, get rid of the huge RuneScape player, and make the Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube icons a little bit smaller. Other than that, I like the design and colors of it.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of flaws in the design of this, and that’s before you put any code behind it. First and foremost in the header you have the “indigo” text several times across it, this takes away the power of the navigation bar in user-friendliness. The navbar itself is flawed, the spaces between the elements aren’t equidistant from each of the dividers so it looks wrong. The login form should also be a modal or drop-down rather than an actual form in the navbar. I don’t like the mixing fonts in the purple part underneath the video, they just don’t really flow into each other and make a big clash. The bottom right looks uncomplete with the large cross there rather than an other RS player. I also think that the icons linking to the social media sites etc are too large, they draw attention away from different places and that you could do an extra bit of work on the footer as well. Overall it’s a good attempt but some parts look like it’s been rushed.</p>

<p>The X in the right is there because i couldn’t find nothing decent on google images <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
The nav bar was a little rushed however because I used tab spacing and photoshop does not seem to like that so I left it like that for temporary. Icons are slighty large to consume space because i ran out of ideas, as far as the fonts concerned I was meant to keep the same font style constantly once I found something decent.</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback and I’ll deffo make the tweaks before putting it to code.</p>
