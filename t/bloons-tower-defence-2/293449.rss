    <title>Bloons Tower Defence 2</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bloons-tower-defence-2/293449</link>
    <description>Bloons Tower Defence and Bloons Tower Defence 2 are Flash games which, in my perspective are very good. I&#39;ve only actually played number 2 but who knows, maybe number 1 is also that great.

The main aim of this game is to pop all of the balloons that pass by each level without letting the balloons get from the start to the finish. You start with 100 lives and there are 3 difficulties or levels to speak of being Easy, Medium and Hard. I normally play on the Easy difficulty or level. It&#39;s labelled Easy but it isn&#39;t that Easy. The first 20 levels are Easy, hence the name but as you get further it isn&#39;t. You may be wondering how we pop these balloons. You start off with 650 money and you spend it on creatures and weapons to pop the balloons. Positioning is important and you can only place them on the blue area of the game.

You can try it online here: http://www.ninjakiwi.com/Games/Tower-Defense/Play/Bloons-Tower-Defense-2.html

Sure, it is a bit odd but it&#39;s still quite fun at the same time. How do other people think of it?</description>
