    <title>Can&#39;t log in</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-log-in/370774</link>
    <description>alrighty then, so I have downloaded a ton of sources/clients and edited and done everything in tutorials and stuff, except for portforwarding and np-ip.com.
I have an acc for no-ip, but i don&#39;t understand what to do with it, and I want to know why the hell i am supposed to open my ports on router? can&#39;t i just log in local? I&#39;ve tried logging in and it just says error connecting to server.
So i have deleted all my RSPS files, and am starting over.
---I would like it if somebody could give me a link for a good source/client download that I can work with.
---and explain to me what the hell i need to do with portforwarding(why), and what no-ip is for.
---also, am i able to just log into the client on my computer without it online? just local?

thanks alot guys :P</description>
