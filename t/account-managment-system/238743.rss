I wrote this out of boredom / to familiarize myself with Swing. Turned out to be a rather OKish first project. It probably won&#39;t work with you server and if you have no idea what the fuck you&#39;re doing, don&#39;t download this. 

To get it working, you basically have to either rename the table names in the script, or in your database. 

Mostly posting this as a reference on how to bypass some of the problems I had, but I wouldn&#39;t suggest starting to learn Swing with this. It&#39;s horrible code that I never finished/cleaned-up/optimized. It&#39;s basically a very rough sketch.</description>
