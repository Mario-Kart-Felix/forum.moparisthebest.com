    <title>This stupid Swine Flu shit</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/this-stupid-swine-flu-shit/283290</link>
    <description>I&#39;m a freshman in High School.  Today we had our first day of finals.  In my school, we have a study period, an exam period, study, exam, and leave.  In my second study period, oh quarter after 10 I think?, I was sittin&#39; there, just kinda relaxing. A secretary announces that there is an urget health warning, and one kid from every class had to go down to the office to get like 20 papers.  Each of which containing a letter.  Maybe I&#39;ll post a small picture of this letter, but let me tell you the insanity of the matter (this is a DIRECT QUOTE from the table on the front half):

[b]If your child has both:[/b]
&quot;Fever (100.4 degrees F or 38 degrees C) [b][u]AND[/u][/b] sore throat or cough.&quot;

I used the word &#39;degrees&#39; but on the paper it&#39;s the degree symbol, which Iunno how to make.
Second column, same row:

[b]Then you must:[/b]
&quot;[u]Keep your child home for 7 days.[/u] If after 7 days the child still has symptoms, stay at home until symptoms are gone for 24 hours. Your child might have the flu. Other symptoms can include runny nose, body aches, vomiting, and diarrhea.&quot;

Can I stress the MIGHT HAVE THE FLU part that was mentioned AFTER the part of staying home for 7 days?

I don&#39;t know how everyone else views the Swine Flu, but for fuck sake, they&#39;re telling us to stay home for a whole damn week if we feel like we have the flu.  Can anyone agree/argue with me?  And can anyone list reasons for knowing if you have the normal flu, or if it&#39;s swine flu?  This is just ridiculous.  I can&#39;t wait until there are more &#39;outbursts&#39; and then a vaccine magically comes in, and pharmacies start making a shit load.</description>

Funny thing about the Swine Flu.  The vaccine killed more people than the actual flu.<br>
[/quote]thats terrible![/quote]</p>
<p>It’s true.  Places with outbreaks, as reported by third party media, kill more people who got the vaccination than who didn’t.</p>

              <p>Swine Flu is nothing. It’s a waste of money for the vaccination, and it’s no worse than the regular flu. Not many people have died, the media just makes it sound like thousands. If you get it, you just treat it like any other flu. People in Mexico die because they don’t have the same lifestyle as we do, so they can’t always treat it properly.</p>

<p>didnt think we had a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8071758.stm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">vaccine</a> for swine flu. The reason you should take tamiflu is that it destroys the protein made by the virus strain H1N1, it makes symptoms alot less likely to occur and makes the virus a lot less lethal. It isnt a cure however it just can prevent the proteins</p>

The reason you should take tamiflu is that it destroys the protein made by the virus strain H1N1, it makes symptoms alot less likely to occur and makes the virus a lot less lethal. It isnt a cure however it just can prevent the proteins</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>I’m a freshman in High School.  Today we had our first day of finals.  In my school, we have a study period, an exam period, study, exam, and leave.  In my second study period, oh quarter after 10 I think?, I was sittin’ there, just kinda relaxing. A secretary announces that there is an urget health warning, and one kid from every class had to go down to the office to get like 20 papers.  Each of which containing a letter.  Maybe I’ll post a small picture of this letter, but let me tell you the insanity of the matter (this is a DIRECT QUOTE from the table on the front half):</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">If your child has both:</span><br>
“Fever (100.4 degrees F or 38 degrees C) <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">AND</span></span> sore throat or cough.”</p>
<p>I used the word ‘degrees’ but on the paper it’s the degree symbol, which Iunno how to make.<br>
Second column, same row:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Then you must:</span><br>
“<span class="bbcode-u">Keep your child home for 7 days.</span> If after 7 days the child still has symptoms, stay at home until symptoms are gone for 24 hours. Your child might have the flu. Other symptoms can include runny nose, body aches, vomiting, and diarrhea.”</p>
<p>Can I stress the MIGHT HAVE THE FLU part that was mentioned AFTER the part of staying home for 7 days?</p>
<p>I don’t know how everyone else views the Swine Flu, but for fuck sake, they’re telling us to stay home for a whole damn week if we feel like we have the flu.  Can anyone agree/argue with me?  And can anyone list reasons for knowing if you have the normal flu, or if it’s swine flu?  This is just ridiculous.  I can’t wait until there are more ‘outbursts’ and then a vaccine magically comes in, and pharmacies start making a shit load.</p>
