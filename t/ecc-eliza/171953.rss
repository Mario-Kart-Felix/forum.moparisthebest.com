    <description>Hi,

[s]I was wondering if someone could help me find ECC Eliza v4.09. I tried google and was unable to find it. I know it&#39;s not really &quot;programming&quot; writing for it, but since it is outputted variably, I guess it does somewhat count...
oh and Sorry if this is the wrong section :\[/s]
Never mind, found it, it was labeled wrong.</description>
