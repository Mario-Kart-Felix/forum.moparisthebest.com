    <title>Fans in PC sound like they&#39;re taking off</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fans-in-pc-sound-like-theyre-taking-off/346623</link>
    <description>My tower has two fans in it, three if you count the power supply. The power supply fan isn&#39;t doing it though. Basically what happens is when I&#39;m running multiple things(it&#39;s happening now and I have VMWare running, iTunes, Photoshop, and chrome with gmail and mitb, plus msn/aim/some other lightweight things..)

My computer isn&#39;t lacking speed at all, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s struggling with running the stuff.

And here&#39;s the problem: My fan will randomly accelerate to around 6000rpm, stay there for 2-3 seconds, then go back to around 2000rpm. I could understand it if it was staying at 4000-6000(6000 is quite loud) for a while to cool down, but for some reason it just throttles back and forth between the two for a while.

What&#39;s weird is when I run intensive things for long periods of time(modern warfare, after effects rendering, autodesk inventor), it doesn&#39;t do it... It&#39;s only with certain combinations of processes.

My processor temperature is 62 Celsius atm, which I didn&#39;t think was that hot(is it?)

Someone told me I should try applying new thermal paste to my processor. Would that help?

tl;dr pc fans are buggy, wat do</description>

<p>I was using “CPIUD Hardware Monitor” for those readings, it displayed both cores</p>
<p>My motherboard isn’t Asus, it’s some strange name I’d never heard of. I looked it up the other day and couldn’t really find much info on it :x I forget what it is now though and cba restarting to see that number thing atm <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>My BIOS doesn’t have those options anyways :\</p>

Secondly, what socket do you have?<br>
Thirdly, you should reapply some thermal paste to the cpu and then, more importantly, you should make sure the heat sink is tightly secured to the cpu.</p>
<p>I personally was a bit bored so I decided to take my processor out for lulz but after I didn’t screw my heat sink back in properly and had the exact same problem. (temps exceeded 65C, fan was constantly at 5000rpm). I then simply screwed the screws tighter and everything was fine.</p>
<p>ps, 62 is safe but is still hot.[/quote]</p>
<p>AMD Athlon 64bit dual core 5200, 2.7ghz</p>
<p>If by socket you mean where the processor connects, I’m not sure, it’s got the pinholes with a lever to open/close(i’ve seen it in a lot of computers, I think it’s default?)</p>
<p>I’ve taken the heat sink and the processor out completely, to see if there was anything obstructing the pins or the heat sink and the processor from touching, and there didn’t seem to be anything. I guess I’ll go to Radioshack tomorrow and pick up some of the paste, it says they’ve got it online, I guess it’s worth a try.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/ollie">@Ollie</a>, I’ve tried SpeedFan and I read the configuration to make sure I was doing everything correctly, but for some reason it never seemed to change anything. And I’ve also checked my BIOS, but I don’t seem to have any control over the fans?  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>But yeah, I’ll try the thermal paste. Hopefully that works, thanks! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Edit: I was actually wondering, about the BIOS… I can see my processor speed, and some other settings, but they’re grey and unusable while the other settings are blue and selectable. The BIOS manufacturer is Phoenix, do they not allow you to change these settings for things like over clocking?</p>
<p>Edit2: Quick unrelated side note, I just emptied my recycle bin and it said it was deleting 10.4 TB of data o.o I didn’t even know my HD was that big!(It’s not :p)</p>

              <p>check in the bios they are not set to max, I thought my processor was overheating all the time because it was running ridiculously fast all the time, whilst being extremely loud at the same time. All I did was go into the bios and set my fan speed to auto-configuration based on the CPU temp, it found its max and min speeds and chose what would be best. I have the P5Q Deluxe motherboard, but the option should be available on most motherboards. If not use <a href="http://www.almico.com/speedfan.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">SpeedFan</a>.</p>

              <p>You have obviously never had an aftermarket fan for a AMD Athlon XP CPU in your computer.  They sound like they are taking off from when you turn the computer on to when you turn it off, all of the computers I’ve ever had have been pretty loud mostly, at least until the intel core2duo fans got so quiet.</p>
<p>Though if it is speeding up and slowing down like that, you may have another problem.</p>

              <p>My old pc used to be pretty quiet unless I put it under high load and then the case fan would double in speed, making it much much louder. Perhaps your pc is doing this? Also 62C is pretty hot for a CPU, a GPU at that temperature i’d consider normal though.</p>
