    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-block-cheat-clients/420453</link>
    <description>hi i was just wondering how to block cheat clients from connecting to my server? i know the uid method but are there any other ways to defend from cheat clients?

also i was wondering on how to make a specific monster have attack delay. the monster hits like over and over again with no delay.</description>
