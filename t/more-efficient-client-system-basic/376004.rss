    <description>Tired of updating your client, rarring, it forever, then taking another lifetime to upload it?!?!?!
This system will make it easier for you, by making it faster to rar your files, and to upload them faster as well, and for your players, faster downloads and less space taken up!
Works with: Almost any client with a signlink class

Difficulty: If you cant do this, please.. just leave...

Files/Folders Edited: Signlink.java, Cache folder


First, go to your signlink.java, and search for something like:
[code]String string_0_ = &quot;cache&quot;;[/code](Vaires for different clients)
and you should be confronted with a code like this:
[code]public static final String findcachedir(){
		do {
			String string;
	    try {
			String string_0_ = &quot;cache&quot;;
			String string_1_ = &quot;./&quot;;
			File file = new File(new StringBuilder().append(string_1_).append(string_0_).toString());
			if(!file.exists() &amp;&amp; !file.mkdir()) break;
			string = new StringBuilder().append(string_1_).append(string_0_).append(&quot;/&quot;).toString();
		} catch(Exception exception){ break; }
			return string;
		}
		while(false);
		return null;
	}[/code]

Now see this?
This is were the client detects the cache to use it for sprites etc.
Now look at this:
[code]String string_0_ = &quot;cache&quot;;
String string_1_ = &quot;./&quot;;[/code]
the &quot;./&quot; is saying that the cache is in the same folder as were the other java files are, so change that to
[code]C:/cache/[/code] or whatever your cache&#39;s name is, so it looks like this:
[code]String string_0_ = &quot;cache&quot;;
String string_1_ = &quot;C:/cache/&quot;;[/code]

Now its telling the client to look for the cache in the c drive, this is also used in making webclients, now you can take the cache out of the client, .rar it, then put your copy of it in the C: drive, then upload the .rar, then your players put the cache inside the .rar in the c: drive once, so they wont need to anymore, this exponentially lowers client size, and will make your players happier, by not having to wait a long time to download HUGE files, only once, and the rest is easy quick downloading

Enjoy!</description>

</aside>
<p>yes it will, your not getting some cache from a different source, your using the same cache that you used before the tutorial, ive tried this on hyperion (474 version), delta, and PI, all working perfectly.</p>

like i said, this is very basic, i know its messy, but this was code was ripped out of some client i found laying around on my desktop, which is how most bluur/clients for delta are <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
