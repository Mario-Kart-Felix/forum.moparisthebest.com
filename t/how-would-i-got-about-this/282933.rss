    <title>How would I got about this?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-would-i-got-about-this/282933</link>
    <description>How would I make it that if I click the rocks (mining) I continue mining for like 2 to 3 ores? (I know to use misc.random) but how would I make it that if I clicked it the person would mine and mine until he gets like 2 ores then the animation stops? This is my current code.
[code]if (objectIDz == 450) {
			mine(85,451,1,1750,&quot;Rune Rock&quot;,3);
		}[/code]
To explain the above code &quot;85&quot; is the level of mining needed for the rock. &quot;451&quot; is the ore &quot;1&quot; is the amount &quot;1750&quot; is the animation. So yes help :P</description>

To explain the above code “85” is the level of mining needed for the rock. “451” is the ore “1” is the amount “1750” is the animation. So yes help <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
