    <title>Server Memory Usage</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-memory-usage/303410</link>
    <description>Hello, what the normal memory usage is for a blank server. Blank as in player rendering, no world items, no other players. Because I did ::fpson on the client and it says it&#39;s using 15mb of RAM, and the client is using 90mb+. Is that normal or considerably higher than what it should be?</description>
