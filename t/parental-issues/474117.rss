    <description>I know most of you don&#39;t care, but I figured I&#39;d seek advice anyway.

When I was 14 I had this bright idea to go out with friends and vandalize shit. I didn&#39;t care (at the time) how hard people worked for their belongings, all I cared about was having fun and entertaining my friends. It&#39;s sad to say we all got caught and spent a weekend in juvie. I am currently on probation until I reach 18.

Alright, now it&#39;s time to get to the point of this thread. Here lately I&#39;ve been hanging out with a &#39;bad&#39; group of people who smoke, drink, etc, and my parents don&#39;t want me near/around them because they know I&#39;ll end up getting into trouble again. However, right now we live in the &#39;ghetto&#39; and every kid my age is like that. So, earlier today I went out to hang with a few buddies, and it just so happens my mom pulls up and sees them smoking. It is then she yelled for me to get my ass into the car, which was really embarrassing.

So, what should I do? Do as she says and pick new friends? Thanks for any advice.

Just to let you all know, I may seem like a selfish punk but I&#39;m really not. I&#39;ve just made a few bad decisions.</description>

<p>Your parents can’t just start making more money, (if people could just start getting more money, don’t you think everyone would do that?) and if you tell them to work harder, they’ll probably get mad at you.</p>

Stop hanging out with them. If your 14 and on moparscape, I can assume that you are partially intelligent (since a good majority of people have no clue how to use a computer) and with that being that case, hang out with nerds, people of your own kind. I understand about the “nerds” are the geeks or losers or whatever; but junior/senior year of high school comes around and no one gives a shit.<br>

<p>not true at all, those that give in when others call them ‘pussy’ just shows what a pussy they truly are. and it lets other people know that you are influenced so easily by something as simple as  a 2 syllable word.</p>
<p>I remember in school one time kid A called kid B a pussy and he simply replied ‘i am what i eat’ kid A then proceeded to call kid B a faggot but that was the end of the conversation and pressure.</p>

<p>I don’t know what to think of this post, so I won’t.</p>
<p>Look OP, the people you hang with doesn’t matter,it’s the decisions. You might hang out with kids who are a ‘bad influence’, but that’s only if you let them influence you. You CLEARLY understand their actions are immortal, therefor you have the self control to not do those things. It’s all about what you do. Don’t let them affect how you act, what you say or what you wear. Sure It’s human nature to go with what’s around us, but sometimes that’s not always right.</p>
<p>Take civil rights issues in the 50s, for example. Based off what I’ve heard, you wouldve been on the white side telling those niggers (my phone doesn’t have that as a word. Really android?) to sit in the back and to get off of the white water fountain. Sure you knew it was bad, but what difference does that make? Knowing is the first step. Acting is the second.</p>

Im really only 13 and i would  consider my self pretty smart because most kids my age can even make a simple command on java or anything and really ive almost finished a whole server. so my recomemdation once more is to find your talent and do what u can to earn a couple $ and then finally move away from the “ghetto”</p>
<pre><code>            Hope i helped you at all,
                                              Host Gushers</code></pre>

If your 14 and on moparscape, I can assume that you are partially intelligent (since a good majority of people have no clue how to use a computer) and with that being that case, hang out with nerds, people of your own kind. I understand about the “nerds” are the geeks or losers or whatever; but junior/senior year of high school comes around and no one gives a shit.</p>

              <p>Well to me, you seem like a hopeless moron, but if you want to change, here are a few suggestions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Get a job<br>
-Less time to be around your idiotic friends and an income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get new friends<br>
-If you get in trouble with your friends again, you have multiple convictions on your file. Say goodbye to any potential college and enjoy flipping hamburgers as a career.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do better in school<br>
Good grades/participation in activities=COLLEGE=getting away from your ‘ghetto’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do all the above, than go to the juvenile center and find out how to get your records expunged/sealed. This will mean no future employers/schools/etc can view your records(though must places block the viewing of juvenile records, you need to do this).</p>
</li>
