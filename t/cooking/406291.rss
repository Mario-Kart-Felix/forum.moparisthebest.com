    <description>Well, I need a rotation int for the Item On Item packet. I am trying to code cooking, but I have no idea how the variable for the item&#39;s rotation works. If anyone has a source that has cooking and has it displayed like this:

You would need to search for something like...
[code=Java]sendItemOnInterface(1743, x, shrimps);[/code]

Where 1743 is cooking interface, x is rotation, and shrimps is raw shrimp id. If it was coded sufficiently, shrimps shouldn&#39;t be an actual number. For example mine is:
[code=Java]sendItemOnInterface(1743, x, f.getRaw());[/code]</description>
