So what happend is, i got back stabbed by an friend, he hacked my status page, and it was on hes account.
so he uses my Ip to get hes owner server 100%, he just edited the advertisements things, and now
hes asking cash from me, then he will delete it, the point is, if i want to add a new no-ip, then i cant
approve my server, since it results to the same ip as the other one, i would like to if im able
to get my host back, just give me a reset link that i must open on the vps, i would like to.
