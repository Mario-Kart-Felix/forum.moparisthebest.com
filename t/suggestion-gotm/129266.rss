    <title>[Suggestion] GOTM</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/suggestion-gotm/129266</link>
    <description>FastBawlz, can you please consider doing a Graphic of the Month. Contestants can use Photoshop, GIMP, 3DS Max, Terragen, Maya, C4D ect (whatever they want) to create a large image that impresses the voters. I think this would be a really good add on as I like competing in competitions that have to really make me work for a week or two. 

Maybe you could speak to an admin about a reward? [br][size=1]Posted on: July 31, 2007, 04:56:57 AM[/size][hr]Opinions?</description>

<p>You go searching, I remember it being asked a few times, but the difference is they wanted SOTM, Signaute of the month, your just wanting to change the S To a G.</p>
<p>So yeah, basically thats what I’m saying</p>
