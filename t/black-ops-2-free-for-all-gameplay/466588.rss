              <p>[quote=“Kidpaparoach, post:15, topic:466588”]You clearly didn’t read my note at the end of my post, I badly word my sentances. I meant can be used, of course they can still be used like that but its not the main function. If it was they wouldn’t have been buffed.<br>
YOU HAVE TO PAY POINTS TO USE THE PISTOL, IF THEY DIDN’T MAKE IT GOOD THEN NOBODY WOULD USE IT. I just told you the reason why they made them good in close range, now stop repeating yourself unless your going to not ignore what I responded to it.<br>
You can’t hide in blops2 very well if you weren’t aware, believe it or not but the how the game works is not how its meant to be i.e. you regenerate health super fast = not a normal thing.<br>
The dude was too slow at knifing.</p>
<p>The excecuter is like a shotgun (2 bullet kill in close range), 5 bullet mag(?), it has no range and the reload time is slow. The b23r (3 burst pistol) is the best pistol, it is very good at close range, medium range it turns to poo and its got a 15 bullet mag(21 ext mags) which is easy to burn through fast if you want to use the gun effectively. If you want the ext mags attatchment you may aswell go for overkill with the ksg shotgun (not much worse range with the shotgun tbh). The rest of the pistols aren’t very good. Of course you have the option to akimbo your pistols which does make them op in close range and utter poo med-long range.[/quote]<br>
First of all, stop getting pissed off. Second of all, you seem to be stating the same thing over and over to, so you can shut up a bit about that. Third, you have to pay A POINT, to get the pistol, same with every gun in the game (aside from the defaults). I obviously read what you said, otherwise I wouldn’t have been able to respond in the way I did. Seeing as kids use pistols in anything from long range, to close range, they aren’t as weak as you are stating. It’s the same deal with the shotguns, the semi-auto requires 3-4 bullets at a range where the 1 burst can still 1 hit you. But that’s understandable seeing as it’s semi-auto. As for you comparing the strength to mag size, a 15 round mag is plenty more then the 5 round mag of a shotgun, yet they are equally powerful, compared to a vector at 48 (i think), or most mg’s at 30-60. LMGs, having the most ammo, sit at 100+ (usually). Difference is they take the longest to reload, even with all attachments/perks to help speed them up.</p>

<p>Look right there. You state clearly that pistols are not meant for last resort anymore, then blatantly state they are to be used for last resort. I’m saying, when your in a run-and-gun situation (say kill confirmed) a mg, or smg should be able to drop a pistol any day of the given week, not the other way around.</p>
<p>For snipers being over powered, I didn’t mean the actual power of the gun, I mean, it’s a sniper, that’s the point, to be hidden and take out enemies fast. But still, the semi-automatics shoot too fast (some might have had a modded controller).</p>
<p>Look about 40-42 seconds in this vid:<br>

it shows how bad the knife is, not that he panic knifed, but how he clearly had the hit, and nothing happen.</p>

<p>I agree with you there, for a split second I thought that he was giving us black ops for free… <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>Also, my two cents on this game, I like most things about it. It’s fair, it’s actually a challenge to you and it’s now more team-based. The only quarry I have with this is that there are some highly over-powered pistols. They absolutely shit on any sub-machine guns with their bullet damage (I think the pistol fires 2 bullets per one trigger stroke?). I only got the game today, mind you, so those are basically my first impressions.</p>
<p>I think it’s quite good that you can’t walk into the game and expect it to be easy. A game should be hard, so they were spot on with that aspect of the game.[/quote]<br>
^This guy agrees the pistol is overpowered.</p>

              <p>No, I wasn’t debating that. I was debating what you claim are facts, you can’t suddenly chang what you stated as a fact.<br>
Knifing, I’m not sure about. I use the tactical layout, I don’t panic knife.<br>
You get 10 points to spend, if pistols were bad nobody would want to use them. They only overpower primary guns in certain situations against weaker classed primary guns (i.e. the b23r would overpower the m27 in close range however the   m8a1 would overpower it; in long range all pistols get overpowered exl the use of modded controllers).<br>
Pistols cannot beat any MG(bit vague, machine gun, did you mean SMG?), the guns can only perform as well as the user if your constantly loosing to pistols you mustn’t be very good. Pistols are no longer meant to be used as a last resort, their meant to be used with snipers, specialised classes, shotguns and of course as a last resort.<br>
Snipers cannot shoot a clip in a second, the semi automatic sniper rifles do have a fairly fast fire rate but other factors doesn’t make that overpowered. Their aren’t many lines of site for snipers, maps for the most part are fairly small, the semi-automatic ones aren’t automatic obviously and social factors which put people like myself of using them as it is considered an ‘asshole tactic’. They are of course a powerful weapon but they are not overpowered. The zoom time for the snipers are pretty slow exl the semi-autos, even the dsr-50 has a pretty bad zoom in time.<br>
The guns in this game are powerful, you don’t play the mw series so of course you wouldn’t be used to it.<br>
I have a fair few grammatical mistakes and missed out parts I should’ve said but effort.</p>

I get moabs etc on mw3, I’m genuinly a good player. I don’t know of any gun I’m not decent/better than average with. Now blackop2s …, I’m not very good at it.<br>
If it were similar, I’d be good at both? The guns have more of a blackops 1 feel to it apose to a mw3 feel…<br>
It isn’t the same in any respect exl perks. I don’t really like blops2 and blops1, I like mw2 and mw3 = explain.</p>
