    <title>How to add prayer?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-add-prayer/260682</link>
    <description>Can anyone help me with adding a good prayer that actually works.
I mean when u activate the prayer the icon lights up. But it doesnt do anything. + i need to limit how much prayers of one type can be activated at once(ex: protect item and protect mage at the same time on?)
So what i need help with is adding prayer and also adding the values and the head icons i need them to come up when u do smite , protects and so on.

Any lead or help would be greatly appreciated. :mad:</description>
