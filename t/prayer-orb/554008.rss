    <title>Prayer orb</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/prayer-orb/554008</link>
    <description>I was removing a lot of clusters server sided that i didnt want, literally kinda even deleted full files and then fixed the errors, everything was working fine, but when i tried to login, the client had an error loading the prayer orb and froze, i used the client on another server and it worked, so i commented out the prayer orb loading and now it works, but i thought the orbs where added client sided and im pretty sure i didnt remove the prayer points, is there something else i could&#39;ve screwed server-sided?</description>
