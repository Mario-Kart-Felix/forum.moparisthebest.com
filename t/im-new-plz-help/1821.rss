    <description>OK first of all my first post!!!Lol.OK i need some help.Im absolutely new in these codes etc. but i want to learn it.I need some help with graphics handler.
1)Where exactly i have to put all the codes?Could you give me an example so i can understand it more?
2)How do i test that graphics?I dont know the command.I tried ::mageid ::graphicid etc.
3)I tried to make new shop but it doesnt work.I placed new npc in shops.cfg ,edited the autospawn.cfg so that npc spawns, added items to sell in file which contains it etc.I put that npc in first place of autospawn like somebody in this forum said but it still doesnt work.When i try to trade to npc nothing happens.
