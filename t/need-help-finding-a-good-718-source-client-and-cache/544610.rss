    <title>Need Help finding a good 718 Source,client and cache</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-finding-a-good-718-source-client-and-cache/544610</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been wanting to open up my own rsps for some time now. I have the money for a vps, But the problem is, I dont have a source to throw onto it. the reason i want a source and client is so i can look at it before i put it on my server. Im looking for a source that can be on my server for a temporary time untill i can learn how to create my own quality source. Im looking for the regular stuff.
-Gwd
-Nex
-corp
-Upgrade tokens if possible?
-Dung
-Setup donating stuff (Areas and such)
-dicing
-G.E (If Possible)

Those are jsut some of the things i want in it.
As i said,Im Going to only use it untill i learn how to code my own 718 source
I will give ALL credit to the person who made the source untill i create my own.
Thank you.
And please dont call me lazy. ive tryed coding with no avail and looked all over moparscape and all other websites for good source,client and cache.</description>
