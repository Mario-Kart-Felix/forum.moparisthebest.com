What is Varrador?

Hi there guys. Welcome to Varrador&#39;s Official Moparscape project thread. This thread is going to contain exclusive updates on my new and first project &#39;Varrador&#39;. Yeah okay, its a 508 but WHO CARES!. 508&#39;s are just perfect if they are coded correctly and by someone who knows what they are doing. Varrador is hopefully going to be one of the most advanced 508&#39;s projects going at this time.

Varrador is going to be an all round server, Just like Runescape. There will be 100% Pk/Wilidy with a fantastic custom coded combat system giving the best combat possible, All skills will be working to the highest they can be, they might not be perfect but they will be close. 80% of the Runescape Minigames back in the day and just so much more. This is going to be a Giant project for me and hopefully I can pull this of and work on other servers if i enjoy doing this.

I also do note that I am not very confident with Runescape features. I&#39;m just a Java developer and wanted to start something different.
