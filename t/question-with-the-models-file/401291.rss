    <description>I have a model file here but there is only one, should there be only one or more? (i did not code the client), if it was more or only one, should it be on a .rar or I have to extract it to the models file?</description>

              <p>all all depends on how your client loads models, there is only 1 models folder and you dont need any more.</p>
<p>if all the models inside that folder are .DAT files then thats where you have to extract and compressed models and add them. if all the ressed are compressed then you dont need to worry</p>
