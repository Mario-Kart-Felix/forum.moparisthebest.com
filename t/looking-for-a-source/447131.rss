    <description>I NEED A SOURCE! POINT ME TOWARDS ONE PL0X!

Hello, I quit RSPS coding and stuff a while back and am looking to get back into it again. I&#39;m looking for a server source to start upon. I plan on making it a PK server, but I have some epic ideas etc. to add in. Basically, I&#39;m looking for a clean PI with a bunch of stuff added, IE torva, claws, and all those newer items. There doesnt have to be anything but the source and the items...and a client to use or one that works with it. I repeat, please do not lead me to a source with a bunch of sh** added to it. Thanks in Advance.</description>
