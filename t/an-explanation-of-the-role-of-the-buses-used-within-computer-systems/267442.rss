    <description>Heya,
    
     Left my coursework kinda late... i got like 6 hours before i need to upload it and im virtually done except for this question. 

[b]&quot;An explanation of the role of the Buses used within Computer Systems 
and how they interact with the CPU
So add information to show the process of data flowing from input, RAM, CPU, Storage and output naming the buses it uses.&quot;[/b]

I understand where the data flows from and where to flows to, but i dont remember what buss&#39;s it uses... or even fully understand the question to be hounest. Can anyone give me a hand?</description>
