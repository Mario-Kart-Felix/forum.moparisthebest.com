    <title>SCAR Popularity Going Down? Or Just Noobs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/scar-popularity-going-down-or-just-noobs/1342</link>
    <description>Lately I&#39;ve been seeing that SCAR is being dissed by MANY

people. After i saw a former SCAR scripter Underestimate SCAR, 

i fealt (sp?) it had gone too far. Please post possible reasons 

why this is happening and how it can be stopped. I do NOT 

the general public seeing this so i&#39;ll post this here</description>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<p>Agreed with this as well. I spent so much time getting my version to the point its at now, and after looking back, its all wasted. I have done alot of good, but really, I could had already just made one by now proabably. Aryan started out with design flaws that just takes too much to overcome all the way. Dont get me wrong, it was a great bot at one time. Props to the devs that created it and looking at the source jump started me tremendesly on my own endeavors.</p>

<p>I talk to people to try to get an idea if they would be someone good to work with, and everyone wants to try to fix Aryan. I wish them good luck, but I am beyond that stage of thinking for good, its not even an option I will consider. (No time to actyally do alot of work is causing me major problems though.)</p>

<p>Yeah, Extract the data out of the client, and then 100% mouse/key events sent to the applet is the way to go. Filling the mouse movement arrays is ok/decent, not ideal, but a short term fix and is not as undetectable as real events.</p>

<p>Public Aryan's are screwed...(I have no motivation to make it better and it it out for all the idiots) Havent dug through rulers source, but from experience I am pretty sure he has at least partially wasted his time. In the end all of it probably. :)[/quote]<br>haha not all of my time is wasted yet :).  Well if one does dev a bot that uses just key/mouse actions most aryan scripts can be converted to be compliant with some work.  (tiles,object ID's)  Now why can't aryan be made into this bot?  Design flaws in what areas?  Keep in mind the current detection methods don't req all mouse/key events.  In theory they might in the long term.</p>

<p>Ford owns jaguar and alot of other european companies, and mopar <em>cries</em> has merged to make daimler chrysler, which owns mercedes, so of course since they are now the same companies some of the european crap designs are making their way over here, for the most part if you want a good quality automobile you have to look for cars at least 1990 or older <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png?v=3" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

</blockquote></aside>

<p>again you are wrong, the SRT10 has a 8.2? liter 508 cubic inch aluminum block V10 motor in it, its not a hemi <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=3" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> (and hemis have been around since the first hemi in a car, the awesome 1951 Chrysler 300 :D)</p>

<p>and dragsters are awesome in thier own right</p>

<p>(you still dont know enough about cars to argue with me, grab a book <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> :D)<br>[/quote]</p>

<p>I'll stay in my area you stay in yours, I don't think I want to learn about Obese Fuel Tanks and nor do you want to learn about the sophistication of German Engineering. I don't learn from books I learn from experience. Mainly because my cousin is a mechanic. He owns a American Car (unfortunately) Plymouth Barracuda.</p>

<p>Leave it to the Americans to put a Racebred Engine in a Pickup Truck.</p>

<p>Just pretend we do not exist and continue with SCAR or Aryan or whatever this thread was about :P[/quote]</p>

<p>your cousin is a smart man, owning an awesome mopar like that and all <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png?v=3" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>and I know from experiance, I have worked on many many cars, Im also studying to be a mechanical engineer, foriegn engineering basically sucks when compared to american engineering in every aspect, they simply wouldnt know how to build a good solid decent car if it bit them in the ass <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>again you are wrong, the SRT10 has a 8.2? liter 508 cubic inch aluminum block V10 motor in it, its not a hemi <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=3" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> (and hemis have been around since the first hemi in a car, the awesome 1951 Chrysler 300 :D)</p>

<p>and dragsters are awesome in thier own right</p>

<p>(you still dont know enough about cars to argue with me, grab a book <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> :D)[/quote]</p>

<p>I'll stay in my area you stay in yours, I don't think I want to learn about Obese Fuel Tanks and nor do you want to learn about the sophistication of German Engineering. I don't learn from books I learn from experience. Mainly because my cousin is a mechanic. He owns a American Car (unfortunately) Plymouth Barracuda.</p>

<p>Leave it to the Americans to put a Racebred Engine in a Pickup Truck.</p>

<p>Just pretend we do not exist and continue with SCAR or Aryan or whatever this thread was about <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=3" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>In the same manner if Aryan or any other bot brings in more money than SCAR it's ovbious SCAR is going down in popularity. I only use SCAR on my main now since it's hardy detectable.</p>

<p>Well deuh, they don't bother learning to script properly, they make scripts even a 3 year old could detect -.-<br>I say we just find new ways and keep the noobs satisfied with what they have, atleast Jagex decreased the millions of brainless aryan bitches in the game.</p>
