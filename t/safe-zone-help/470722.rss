    <title>Safe zone help!</title>

    <description>Im trying to add pvp and safe zone in a mine,
I managed to make half of the mine pvp.

The other half on the other hand is not?
It still has this walkable skulled interface, but if i click attack it does the correct thing, &quot;this play is not  in the wilderness&quot;
So basically i just cant make the skulled interface into a safe zone interface? 
Yes i have put the safe zone coord in the player.java

ANy help?</description>
