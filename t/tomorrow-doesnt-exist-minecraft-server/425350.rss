    <title>Tomorrow doesnt exist minecraft server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tomorrow-doesnt-exist-minecraft-server/425350</link>
    <description>the admin of this server is unable to get on irc, always gets connection refused from irssi.
is there still demand for the server? anything you want changed?
the admin apologizes for downtime, but it&#39;s been stable for a while now.

if it&#39;s just been forgotten about/no one knows, the admin welcomes all players interested, preferably cm and up.
this isn&#39;t meant as an ad, as it was just put up for people on irc, but just in case anyone is interested
tomorrow.doesntexist.com is the server address, default port</description>
