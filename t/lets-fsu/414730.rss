    <description>Hey guys so im totally new to coding servers and everything and basically my ideal thing to do right now would be to pair up with someone who can code well or above well and dual code a server. Note im not like most people who cant code and just wanna make money so they beg and beg for help from someone who can. I want to mutually code a server, learn as we go, have a good time, run a sucsessfull server, and basically just have some fun  So ofc if u help me u get co owner or whatever rank u want in the server...i can host from my house (have it all set up) and once we start getting donations all the moneys going to go to the server (atleast untill we have a good vps, and other things.) and so yeah...Oh yeah real quick, some info about myself...
Im 14, but dont worry im not one of thoes immature anoying kids and also my voice isnt all high pitched so thats a +  My names tanner...odvisully..i want to work on computers for a living, i have skype/T.V/and i will get any other program...so yeah thats about it  thanks and i hope somone wants to do this with me!
