              <p>The first one is the very bottom left of the area you want non wildy.  The second cord is the bottom right of the area you want wildy.  The 3rd cord is top left of the area you want wildy and lastly, the 4th cord is the top right cord of the area you want wildy.  Explained well enough?  Also he is saying, you need to make a few of these to get it just right if the area isn’t a square or rectangle.  So if the area you want non wild has jagged boundaries, you need to make a big area non wildy, and on the outer edges that are jagged and are still wildy, you need to make it non wild too by repeating the steps above for the other small, jagged areas.  It’s quite simple once you get the hang of it.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Ok here we go</p>
<p>Open up client.java and search for <code>public boolean nonWild() {</code></p>
<p>You should see a bunch of codes like these.</p>
<p>(absX &gt;=3365  &amp;&amp; absX &lt;=3366 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;=9767  &amp;&amp; absY &lt;=9766 )||</p>
<p>Copy that and the 3365 is the X cords on the bottem left corner of the room and the 3366 is the right cords of the room so then the 9767 is the y cords of the bottem left and the 9766 is the top right y cords of the room.Thats how to make it non wild.You may need to make mulitple codes of these to make a room thats not square non wild.</p>
