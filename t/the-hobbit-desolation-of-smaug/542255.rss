    <title>The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-hobbit-desolation-of-smaug/542255</link>
    <description>[center][img width=300]http://www.ramascreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/The-Hobbit-The-Desolation-Of-Smaug.jpg[/img][/center]

So I just got done watching The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, and I must admit Peter Jackson really knows how to work magic in films. I was looking through quite a few reviews and exclusives and Peter really makes sure every frame of the movie is perfect, I read somewhere that even a simple conversation scene can take days to fill Peter&#39;s satisfaction. The guy really has a love for film making, and as someone who wants to follow the path as him, I can very much say he&#39;s one to look up to.


So the Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug picks up from the chase of the hunt, the Orcs and Azog the Desecrator are hunting down the Dwarfs and Bilbo, but keep in mind this is just a bug on the window, it&#39;s not the only major obstical. Throughout the whole movie I couldn&#39;t help but notice that every single foreign character has it in for Thorin, he&#39;s got it bad man, I mean everyone and their mothers give him the stank eye, you&#39;ve got to feel for the guy. I cant stress how much I want you to see the movie, I don&#39;t want to review much about the story itself, it&#39;s one of those movies I want you to experience yourself, going into the movie with a fresh mind. But I do want to say one thing, Bilbo has one line at the end of the movie and it really is flawless, he says it and then the movie fades out to perfect music. I was sitting there after he said it with my fist ready in the air and I said &quot;don&#39;t you do it, don&#39;t do it!&quot; and then it does it, the movie fades to black. I&#39;ve never been so impressed and hyped by an ending of a good movie, even though I didn&#39;t want it to end. The music after it fades is flawless and fits the editing, cinematography, script, acting etc perfectly. You can just see, smell and taste the amount of effort and time there was put into such a simple end. These movies are the closest thing you&#39;ll get to perfect, though, there was this one scene with a terrible cut and it made me giggle to myself. Knowing that the film was based off the book, it might have been intentionally done to show the childish side that the book has.


So the movie is flawless. You&#39;ll watch it and without a doubt you&#39;ll walk out with the biggest smile of your face and fist full of wanting more. If you choose to pass this movie for whatever reason, it&#39;s your loss and you&#39;re missing out on movie history. Forget every high rating I&#39;ve given every other movie because The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug has set a new standard and it&#39;s nailed it to a golden totem. I&#39;ll give this movie a 8.95555555555555 degrees of fire out of 10.</description>

              <p>The Hobbit book was written more so for children. I can only guess that they tried to make The Hobbit movies the same, characters bouncing around and the CGI as substitute for animation. So much money went into The Hobbits so i’m sure they’ve done it this way for a reason. Just do not compare it to the lord of the rings and you’re fine.</p>

<p>The LoTR trilogy (the first 2 anyways) used CGI as little as possible. Obviously in this day and age CGI is going to be used a lot but honestly it can be overdone. Which is exactly what the Hobbit movies have done.</p>

              <p>An easy way to enjoy the movie is to forget about the book entirely, just see it as something they wrote up themselves, gods knows that most of it probably is. I don’t think The Hobbit is slow, its just long and some people don’t like that as much as others. I kind of agree with the character development, I have only seen development with with Thorin, Bilbo and a tiny bit of Tauriel, but other than those 3 and what should have been the dwarves and possibly Legolas, no one else needs any development.</p>

              <p>2/3rds of the trilogy is painfully average so far. It has no cohesive story to pull you through the three hours each film is, Jackson’s decision to stretch a short book over three 3 hour films has ruined the series so far.</p>
<p>It seems like a cash in for people who love to experience that world the way Jackson presents it. And he does it well - but this is all The Hobbit feels like, it’s a slow, almost meaningless journey through various points in the world and plot, focusing on minor details and embellishing the most minor details. My problem isn’t that it has strayed from the book, it’s that they’ve tried to get far more out of the book than was there in the first place, and it suffers for it. They’ve spread what little content they had far too thinly.</p>
<p>The representation of the world and everything is great. But the characters on the whole and way they progress through the story is really weak, a huge portion of the film feels like nothing but filler.</p>

<p>So I just got done watching The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, and I must admit Peter Jackson really knows how to work magic in films. I was looking through quite a few reviews and exclusives and Peter really makes sure every frame of the movie is perfect, I read somewhere that even a simple conversation scene can take days to fill Peter’s satisfaction. The guy really has a love for film making, and as someone who wants to follow the path as him, I can very much say he’s one to look up to.</p>
<p>So the Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug picks up from the chase of the hunt, the Orcs and Azog the Desecrator are hunting down the Dwarfs and Bilbo, but keep in mind this is just a bug on the window, it’s not the only major obstical. Throughout the whole movie I couldn’t help but notice that every single foreign character has it in for Thorin, he’s got it bad man, I mean everyone and their mothers give him the stank eye, you’ve got to feel for the guy. I cant stress how much I want you to see the movie, I don’t want to review much about the story itself, it’s one of those movies I want you to experience yourself, going into the movie with a fresh mind. But I do want to say one thing, Bilbo has one line at the end of the movie and it really is flawless, he says it and then the movie fades out to perfect music. I was sitting there after he said it with my fist ready in the air and I said “don’t you do it, don’t do it!” and then it does it, the movie fades to black. I’ve never been so impressed and hyped by an ending of a good movie, even though I didn’t want it to end. The music after it fades is flawless and fits the editing, cinematography, script, acting etc perfectly. You can just see, smell and taste the amount of effort and time there was put into such a simple end. These movies are the closest thing you’ll get to perfect, though, there was this one scene with a terrible cut and it made me giggle to myself. Knowing that the film was based off the book, it might have been intentionally done to show the childish side that the book has.</p>
<p>So the movie is flawless. You’ll watch it and without a doubt you’ll walk out with the biggest smile of your face and fist full of wanting more. If you choose to pass this movie for whatever reason, it’s your loss and you’re missing out on movie history. Forget every high rating I’ve given every other movie because The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug has set a new standard and it’s nailed it to a golden totem. I’ll give this movie a 8.95555555555555 degrees of fire out of 10.</p>
