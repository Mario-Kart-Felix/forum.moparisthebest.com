    <description>I&#39;m sick of people from xerox&#39;s server or others who think they themselves can code yet they don&#39;t even have a fucking server... and probably don&#39;t even know what a boolean is... Wow people understand I don&#39;t care if you don&#39;t like that you can&#39;t spawn items on my server... Wow you can&#39;t do it on real rs can you? Just because you can on others... I don&#39;t give a shit... Yes wow xerox has clues like omfgzors...I believe I was the one hwo posted how to do the clues yes he might have editted quite abit but I almost guarantee he got the idea from be considering i was the first to have clues.... and also... I have changed it its not just 1 god dam clue anymore for you faggots who think you know my server after 5 minutes of playing it... jesus christ... its people like this, that are the reason why the people who actually do enjoy my server won&#39;t be able to use it anymore....</description>

              <p>Well thanx both of you, I actually decided not to quit infact the server is 24/7 now that I have a macro that closes the game and reopens it every hour now... and autosaving every half hour which will soon be made to like every 5 mins... Mopar i like your client, yes some of them have some issues smetimes, but I still like them and I know what hard work it is to edit and work with java, getting errors can get very frustrating and sometimes errors lead to more errors which can make you accidently delete something you really need... so basically it sucks... It is hard work and it sucks when people don't give you any respect for what work you've done...</p>

<p>I'd explain, but no time for that. Lets just say a lot of people don't appreciate other's hard work.</p>
