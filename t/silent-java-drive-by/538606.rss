    <title>(silent) java drive by</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/silent-java-drive-by/538606</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know much about this subject, maybe some of you do?

Some people I know were talking about this.
I said that you&#39;d have to be pretty dumb to just give any random java application permission to run in your browser.
But their reply was that a silent java drive by doesn&#39;t need your permission to run, so you could just get infected without even knowing the site you enter wants to run java.

Is this true? If yes, what could you do against getting infected by such a silent drive by?</description>

<p>“HEY COME TEST OUT MY SERVER, ILL GIVE YOU ADMIN FOR FREE!!” and link the person to a fake client. Just one of the ways I’ve seen it done. You’d be surprised how easy people trust each other out there.</p>

              <p>Java applications that can make changes to your system without notifying you are utilizing an exploit for unsigned applets. There was a huge exploit a few months back, it’s fixed now as long as you update to the latest Java runtime. Regardless, it’s pretty stupid to run ANY application (regardless of runtime/language) that doesn’t have a verifiable source (unless of course you have the source code and time to look through it).</p>
