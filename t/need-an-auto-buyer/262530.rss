    <description>My First Request for an Auto.

I was wondering if anyone would make me a script, which includes the following-
-An Auto Log Out/Break
-Random Event Solver

I wish to buy limestone bricks from Keldagrim. I would be at the bank with the cash, run/walk to the stonemason to buy limestone bricks, return to the bank with Cash in the first inventory slot and limestone bricks filling the other 27 slots. Then i would bank the limestone bricks, and repeat the process of buying the Bricks. 
  If anyone does reply to this request, and sends in a script, i&#39;d like to thank you for all the help.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: February 16, 2009, 09:46:38 am[/size][hr]Willing to pay 200k for a decent script. I would like a test run on the script before any money is given.</description>
