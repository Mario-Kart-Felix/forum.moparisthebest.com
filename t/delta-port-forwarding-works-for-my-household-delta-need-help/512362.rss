    <title>[DELTA] Port-forwarding works for my household [/DELTA] NEED HELP!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-port-forwarding-works-for-my-household-delta-need-help/512362</link>
    <description>Hey guys, so I recently portforwarded my Server &amp; everybody in my household can connect to the 192.168.1.4 IP.
But when I change the EGUI to connect to my actual IP (76.XXX.XXX.XXX) I get an error connecting... therefor people outside of my household will not be able to connect to my server, any ideas on how to fix this!?</description>

              <p>In order for people outside of your network to connect, you must make sure your router is portforwarded so they can bypass your firewall and connect to your private server.

People in your wifi network can only conect to you with your local direction(IPV4) and people outside your wifi network can only connect to you with your ip, and it has to be portforwarded.<br>

<p>Yes, I understand that. My problem is I portforwarded my IPV4 &amp; it works well, but when I try to connect using my IP it doesn’t work… I’m not sure what’s going on with it:/[/quote]People in your household can’t connect to your ip.</p>
