    <title>Help Would Be Appriciated =D</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-would-be-appriciated-d/403817</link>
    <description>Hello Moparscape, 
I have been working on a very interesting project, I was working with two other people but they unfortunaly quit
the project because of personal reasons. Anways, I&#39;m going off topic, I came here to ask for some help.
What I need help with is the following:
I need a command such as ::ipban, ::mute, ::jail, ::kick, ::ban, but let&#39;s say my ingame name was Mopar, so if some admin was to type ::ban mopar they would not be able to, but would be able to ban other players. I tried to do it myself but it ended up screwing up.
The last thing I need to know is Project-Insanity uses a different color base, what I mean is before it use to be @blu@ or @whi@ etc. But I do not know the new color codes, if you have them I would really appriciate it. Thanks.</description>

<p>As I Vain I said, I would like to learn instead of leeching, thanks anyways.</p>
<p>[quote=“I Vain I”]The color base used has nothing to do with servers. It’s actually the client’s text-engine. Most <span class="bbcode-i">Project Insanity</span> servers use a client with a 459+ text-engine, which loads <span class="bbcode-u">decimal</span> color values via the shadow and color codes.</p>
<p>As for the, no ‘punishing’ the owner account; you can do something like this;</p>
<p>[code=Java]if (playerCommand.startsWith(“ban”)) {<br>
try {<br>
String[] args = playerCommand.split(" ");<br>
String name = “”;</p>
<pre><code>    for (int i = 0; i &lt; args.length; i++) {
        name = args[i] + " ";
    }

    for(Player p : PlayerHandler.players) {
        if(p != null) {
            if(p.properName.equalsIgnoreCase(name)) {
                if (!p.properName.equalsIgnoreCase("OWNER")) {
                    final Client c = (Client) p;
                    p.disconnected = true;
                    Connection.addNameToBanList(name);
                    Connection.addNameToFile(name);
                } 
            }
        }
    }
} catch(Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
</code></pre>

[/quote]Some people actually wish to learn instead of leech. So, either post useful shit, or leave.[/quote]</p>
<p>Sorry but im not quite understanding what you mean when u say the client text engine. And thanks for the command. I really appriciate it. i will be making the order commands using this base XD</p>
