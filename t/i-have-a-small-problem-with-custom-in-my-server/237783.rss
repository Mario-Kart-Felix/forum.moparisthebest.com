 I just added 5 godswords (custom) and bandos whip in my source..thing is when you move the godswords stay still and dont move..the whip does...but the godswords don&#39;t...and when you attack with any of em they dissappear long enough for you to hit with your hand instead of the weapon then reappear...and the godswords just dont look right....when you hold em...if you look at em from certain angles they are only partially there.Can anyone help me fix this?If so can you tell me how?This is my first time adding custom weps to my server...the armor works fine.
