    <description>MASSACURE:

[IMG]http://i193.photobucket.com/albums/z144/Blueangels50/massacure.jpg[/img]

Everybody,

Im sure your all aware of the runescape masacure. There was 2 people there called:


-Durial
-cursed_you

Both combat 126

Now I want you ALL to read this as carefully as you can. Me and Chemical found it really creepy, it&#39;s one of the scariest thing&#39;s ive seen even though it&#39;s from a game.

-People say the runescape masacure happened from a giltch, by accident! but the truth is it wasn&#39;t by accident. Weve found enoughf evidence to get you thinking, as for this is no joke.

On the 6/6/06 the runescape masacure was filmed, when the glitch happened. Known to what we know was done by these 2 players, on that mysterious date, which im sure your all aware of what it is.

The glitch some how, made it so people could &quot;kill&quot; each other. 

Durial321 made an account on youtube called, durial321, the person that we think made this glitch, on the date of 6/6/06, Check this out, on the vid made about masacure, check out what he posted. look carefully.

[IMG]http://i193.photobucket.com/albums/z144/Blueangels50/massacures.jpg[/img]

He made a random post, and look at how many hour&#39;s it was when he posted, 666 not 111.But how was there still mysteriosly 111? a glitch? no I dont think so. But they posted at 111 hours, this happend in world 111

[IMG]http://i193.photobucket.com/albums/z144/Blueangels50/durial.jpg[/img]

People are saying hes coming back with a glitch

[IMG]http://i193.photobucket.com/albums/z144/Blueangels50/omfg.jpg[/img]

Hes in that picture, taken after the masacure, but he was banned? hes there?

check up durial321 on the high scores, if you pass him in runescape logout immediatly.

Here is something to get you thinking, the new thing posted on runescape.com after he said he is going to put a virus on there, look at the thing posted in the runescape announcment&#39;s. Scary? 

Also watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt4bq6qfScE

Put the music on aswell it blend&#39;s in.
On tip it, they have an interveiw about durial, even there shakey about him

Something is going on, it&#39;s all done on 666, just like the day omen was made.</description>
