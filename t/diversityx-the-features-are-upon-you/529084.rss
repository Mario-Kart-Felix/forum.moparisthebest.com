[center][u][b]We as a team want to give you the best adventure you have ever had on an RSPS.  We want to give you the best features you can possibly handle.  We strive for the most success and we want to give it to you.  We are willing to give you updates everyday and we want people asking for more updates so we are able to add them.  Ever since I was familiar with RSPS I wanted to start a 2006-2007 remake but I never had the motivation to.

This RSPS will be different then the rest and we count on you guy&#39;s for our feedback and for our players![/b][/u][/center]

We want to give you the best features you can possibly handle.  We strive for the most success and we want to give it to you.  We are willing to give you updates everyday and we want people asking for more updates so we are able to add them.  Ever since I was familiar with RSPS I wanted to start a 2006-2007 remake but I never had the motivation to.  Now that I have actually came to this point it’s just I want to do the best that I possibly can and keep everyone satisfied.  We want you to stick to your chairs like it is glue.  This RSPS will be different then the rest and we count on you guy’s for our feedback and for our players!</span></span>[/center]</p>
