    <title>Simplicity-X • Looking For Another Developer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/simplicity-x-looking-for-another-developer/550983</link>
    <description>[center]Hello, here are Simplicity-X we strive daily, to work hard and provide everything our players want to see. We&#39;re different from alot of other 718&#39;s due to what we&#39;re doing and how we&#39;re doing it. We have tons of content being added everyday, and in our next patch release their will be 3 new interfaces. Some new bosses, armors, weapons, places to go, quests, new monsters to kill, new skilling options, and alot more. I have everything I need, I have every resource I need, and I do everything with my team how it is now, but I&#39;m searching for ONE more developer to join up on the team. Requirements is you must contribute some of your time (obviously) but I don&#39;t want no inactive developer that goes MIA for days, randomly. You need to be VERY dedicated this will be a LONG-TERM position. You must have at least a almost intermediate level understanding for Java. [b][u]I&#39;m willing to work with people who aren&#39;t that experienced, as long as you know the basics, and I will help you understand anything you don&#39;t, and teach you anything you can&#39;t do that you&#39;re interesting in, or trying to do.[/u][/b]

[u][b]- Leave a brief summary about you, and your RSPS / programming experiences, and reply here with your skype name and I will contact you.[/b][/u]
