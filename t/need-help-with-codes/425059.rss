<p>if command (changebook ) &amp;&amp; sidebarinterface = 0 {<br>
setsidebarinterface 1<br>
else if siderbarinterface = 1 {<br>
setsidebarinteface 0<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p>its not needed to use 2 commands though, just let it check the spellbook type</p>
<p>and to make tele commands</p>
<p>if commandequals(home) {<br>
triggertele(X, Y);      //x and y are the coordinates, also can be that your servers uses hight then it has to be<br>
triggertlee(x, y, height);<br>
to change the position without the teleport effect u can use<br>
toX =<br>
toY =</p>
