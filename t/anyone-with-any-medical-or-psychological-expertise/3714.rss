    <description>Well this is going to sound really weird... and it&#39;s going to be long

[b]Also, I don&#39;t want any flaming here. This is a very serious matter, and I want it taken that way.[/b]

Well anyways...

Back in February I was sick for a good two weeks with broncidus(sp?) and I slept for 16-18 hours a day during that time. The doctor also gave me some sleep medicine with Codine in it. If you don&#39;t know, Codine is a very powerful narcotic that makes me drowsy and dilerious. It worked well and go me better. But a month later, I was still sleeping ALOT. It started rolling over into school. It started off maybe 1-2 times a week. Not that bad. Then I got talked to by the principle and he asked me if I did/doing drugs. I said no. A week later I had to get a drug test. Fine. Everything came back normal and everything kind of stopped there. Two weeks later, people will still noticing the problem, now that it was happening 1-2 times a day. I then had to go get a sleep study. A sleep study is where the hook all the electrodes up to you to monitor Heart rate, C02 levels, brain waves, and a bunch of other crap. That all came back normal as well. So now, 2 months later, and a $5000 hospital bill, there&#39;s still nothing. I was told to go to a phyciatrist. He said that it could possibly be post-lyme since I had lyme in 2001. I go to another doctor, she takes more blood. 2 weeks later the results come back, all negitive,  run twice. She is the best lyme doctor in the U.S. so i&#39;m pretty sure I don&#39;t have that. So now i&#39;m falling asleep a good 3-4 times a day in school. I have to go to a learning study thing on the 19th and another lyme nuro thing on the 17th. And now, 4 months later, I;m all sad and confused. I don&#39;t know what it could possibly be and now I&#39;m scared that I am dying. If anyone has some ideas/advice what I should do, please tell me. Either here or PM. Thanks.

<p>if yo mean how would they test for it, they cant, its just something that happens to some people, and if you mean how do you get it, you take the codine and then your gene that makes the hormon to put you to sleep is left on and never turned off, so at points it builds up and you just fall asleep</p>

Well, take a look on google for some health or medical forums and you should be able to get some good answers.</p>
<p>I had alopecia areata and had lost a lot of hair. I had countless quartazone shots into my head, they would poor acidic solutions on my head, nothing was growing my hair back. I asked on some forums and they gave me some tips on diets and pills and it all came back, although my hair does fall out extremely easily(strange).</p>

<p>well it will, take what i said and talk to you doctor about it… becauase your condition is serious, you do need to cure it if you wish to survive in life, my doctor told me that if i didnt fix it then i would probally die from oversleeping(who ever heard of that) but seriously, your body is suffering from side effects and you need to change your habits around and dont sleep until you do it without meaning to. if you want ill email your parents a nice long well written out paragraph about this so that they can understand it(but im not donna call them, long distance and stuff, im in frigging hawaii, and your canadian right?)</p>

              <p>okay here is your problem, why you where takeing Codine, your body devolped a defect that causes random sleepyness(the best way put) becasue you have to much of the hormone in your body at certain times(becasue your body doesnt know when to express that gene) so you fall asleep randomly for no reason. now the best way to cure this is to get a medical leave from schoo(about two week) get an xbox live name and play halo 2 for as long as possilbe without sleeps(its the most addictive thing i know so that the best way to help) tehn you need to sleep without disturbances for as long as possible(so if you could get an hotel room or something where you would be understurbed) if you keep doing this, you should soon lose your random sleepyness. i suffered from somethign very close  to this when i was on morphine(Codine’s cousin basically) and this is the best possible way to solve this problem</p>
<p>good luck with that, and taking the drug Melatonin wouldnt help, it would most likly make you much more tired(since your gene would always be expressed) guys he isnt being affected with not being able to sleep,its that he sleeps too much…</p>
<p>oh and off topic, why does xerroxcheez hate you so much?</p>

<p>How many hours of sleep do you get each night?<br>
(While the number varies from one person to another, anything under 8 is likely to cause accumulated fatigue)<br>
Are you, or do you have reason to believe you’re being disturbed in your sleep at home?<br>
Food. Eating the right things, in proper amounts is always going to help in any case.<br>
Even though its approved as a food supplement in the US, and thus available without a prescription, I would suggest you discuss using melatonin with a doctor prior to doing so. Take a look on Wikipedia for some more details on it.</p>
<p>Good luck,</p>

<p>I’m getting 8-10 hours a night of sleep.<br>
I am having a right diet… Well not perfect.<br>
2 glasses of milk a day. 3 of water.<br>
veggies and fruits… proteins… Everything right.<br>
I’m not stirring in my sleep at all.</p>
<p>I having heard of that drug, I’ll suggest it to my psyciatrist.<br>
Thanks.</p>

              <p>You’re not dying.  Chronic tiredness is a cycle.</p>
<p>What you need to get is a supplement called melatonin. It’s naturally secreted by the body to help you go to sleep, and it’s harmless when taken as a supplement. Unlike many other sleep aids, it’s completely non-dangerous and has no side effects of any kind. Take some before you go to bed, and have a strong cup of coffee when you wake up in the morning and you should be fine.</p>

              <p>Well this is going to sound really weird… and it’s going to be long</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Also, I don’t want any flaming here. This is a very serious matter, and I want it taken that way.</span></p>
<p>Well anyways…</p>
<p>Back in February I was sick for a good two weeks with broncidus(sp?) and I slept for 16-18 hours a day during that time. The doctor also gave me some sleep medicine with Codine in it. If you don’t know, Codine is a very powerful narcotic that makes me drowsy and dilerious. It worked well and go me better. But a month later, I was still sleeping ALOT. It started rolling over into school. It started off maybe 1-2 times a week. Not that bad. Then I got talked to by the principle and he asked me if I did/doing drugs. I said no. A week later I had to get a drug test. Fine. Everything came back normal and everything kind of stopped there. Two weeks later, people will still noticing the problem, now that it was happening 1-2 times a day. I then had to go get a sleep study. A sleep study is where the hook all the electrodes up to you to monitor Heart rate, C02 levels, brain waves, and a bunch of other crap. That all came back normal as well. So now, 2 months later, and a $5000 hospital bill, there’s still nothing. I was told to go to a phyciatrist. He said that it could possibly be post-lyme since I had lyme in 2001. I go to another doctor, she takes more blood. 2 weeks later the results come back, all negitive,  run twice. She is the best lyme doctor in the U.S. so i’m pretty sure I don’t have that. So now i’m falling asleep a good 3-4 times a day in school. I have to go to a learning study thing on the 19th and another lyme nuro thing on the 17th. And now, 4 months later, I;m all sad and confused. I don’t know what it could possibly be and now I’m scared that I am dying. If anyone has some ideas/advice what I should do, please tell me. Either here or PM. Thanks.</p>
