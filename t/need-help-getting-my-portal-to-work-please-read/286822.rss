    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-getting-my-portal-to-work-please-read/286822</link>
    <description>Ok, so i added a global object, A Portal (2468) im sure it was that.  Anyways i read some tuts on how to get it working and they all say search for case 2468 in my client.java as thats where i added this portal in and &quot;Case 2468&quot; is not in that folder.
So i used abit of commen sence and made it with some of the other case&#39;s but when i compiled it came up with 100 errors.

Please if you could try to help me then please do.

Thank You,
