    <description>I got some trouble with my npcs i place. They always have 0 hp! How do i give them hp?
Also when i place them i can&#39;t talk to them if that option is availible, help would be appreciated!

Also how do i personalise shops? You know, decide what they sell, and all that?

Finally it won&#39;t let me change to ancient magick. any help? I know about ::switch but it doesn&#39;t work on mine!!</description>

              <p>Ancient magik help:<br>
Not 100% certain but if you go into the MoreInfo folder and find the character you want to to haveancient magic change this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">character-ancients = 0</code></pre>
<p>To this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">character-ancients = 1</code></pre>
<p>This is a temporary solution or just look at the [TuT] which tells you how to get it on the tab left of friends…[br][size=1]Posted at: October 29, 2006, 05:03:47 AM[/size][hr]Shop help:<br>
Open up shop.cfg in Notepad.<br>
Now Browse through the shop list editing what item you want them to sell and how many of each item.<br>
For example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">shop = 1	Varrock_General_Store				1	1	1931	5</code></pre>
<p>Shop = 1 is the shop number - don’t worry about this.<br>
Varrock_general_store is the name<br>
The first 1 means that the shop will sell anything and the other 1 means it will buy anything, when changed to a 2 it means that It will only sell items that it buys So say for the arrow shop shop you can only buy/sell arrows.<br>
The 1931 is the item code<br>
and the 5 is the amount of that item.[br][size=1]Posted at: October 29, 2006, 05:11:36 AM[/size][hr]And finally NPC’s:<br>
Open up npc.cfg in notepad.<br>
Simply find the Npc you want to edit Using cntrl+f and change the health from 0 to whatever you like, you can also edit the NPC’s combat level too.<br>
For example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">npc = 1		Man				2	7</code></pre>
<p>Npc 1 is the code of the NPC - Man<br>
the 2 is the combat level<br>
and the 7 is the health level<br>
Simply change, save and compile!</p>
<p>Hope i helped  ;)[br][size=1]Posted at: October 29, 2006, 05:17:10 AM[/size][hr]So has this helped you or not?</p>
