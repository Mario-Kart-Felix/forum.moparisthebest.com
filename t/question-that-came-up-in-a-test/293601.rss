    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Question 3: If one person invites three people to his party and 4 die how many people are left?
 8
 7
 0
 45
Only invites 3&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The correct answer is `Only invites 3 `, according to the website but, I think it is 0 because of the fact,

One person (There is already 1 person at the party) invites 3 people to the party (1 + 3 Guests = 4) and 4 people die, that makes 0.</description>

<p>Only invites three is the correct answer, because the “and four die” only applies to the invited <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
