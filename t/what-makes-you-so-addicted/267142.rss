    <title>What makes you so addicted?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-makes-you-so-addicted/267142</link>
    <description>Hello,

Ok this is where it comes down to the discussion about if you are &quot;Addicted&quot; or not, i remember when i first joined runescape all i wanted to do was play, and yes i admit it, i did...
I think the reason i liked runescape and got quite addicted was that the fact is a online &quot;Competitive&quot; game.
The way there was high scores and people trying there best to become high in that skill, to get a chance to feel good when pking etc, whats your reason?</description>

              <p>I’ve played since around march '04. The first thing that got me was money making; being richer than everyone else :P. Since I got out of that I used to PK all the time when I was on RS until the wilderness changes happened. I was already into RSPS’s before the wild changes, but the wild changes inspired me a lot more to work on private servers. Every server I’ve made has been a pking one, or one based around pking.</p>

<p>I’m guessing allot of people will say pking, at the time when most people first joined towards the start of runescape, pking was one of the main mini games, but now we have allot more different ones, but still my opinion is that there still not as good.</p>

              <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Ok this is where it comes down to the discussion about if you are “Addicted” or not, i remember when i first joined runescape all i wanted to do was play, and yes i admit it, i did…<br>
I think the reason i liked runescape and got quite addicted was that the fact is a online “Competitive” game.<br>
The way there was high scores and people trying there best to become high in that skill, to get a chance to feel good when pking etc, whats your reason?</p>
