    <description>I&#39;ll just make this short since I can&#39;t be bothered typing a novel right now.

[u][i][b]I&#39;m being sponsored by a hosting company whom I&#39;ve worked with earlier, they&#39;ll provide me with a free host for the first 3 months.[/b][/i][/u]

They are aware of what I&#39;m capable of doing and therefor they decided to grant me a free host, the rent for that hosting service would normally cost 90$ per month. They&#39;ve faith in me and I&#39;m more than sure that with some qualified peoples I&#39;ll be able, we&#39;ll be able, to make something huge.

I&#39;ve made several successful Runescape private servers in my past, my last one was called Misthalin - The Kingdom. 

Observe: That server had it start in June 2010 and went active for at least 1 year before I decided to shut it down due to lack of willing-to-work staff!

I&#39;m graduating from a technical gymnasium this summer and I&#39;ve a lot of knowledge regarding most types of coding, including web-development but I&#39;m not interested of doing all the work my self. 

[u][i][b]I&#39;m looking for:[/b][/i][/u]

5 coders.

3 web developers.

I&#39;m not looking for moderators nor admins right now.

This is a serious project and I&#39;m without any doubt sure that I&#39;m able to make a 317 server in top 3 of all Toplists.

My server Misthalin was ranked 1st server for about 1 year in a row, on several ranking sites and we had a lot of users.

I&#39;m looking for a large staff group, a serious group of people to do this project with. I&#39;m not doing this to make money, it&#39;s a hobby for me.

I&#39;ve also ran several other successful gaming servers during the years. Including Runescape, WoW, PWI, Aion and minecraft.

I&#39;ve never failed and I won&#39;t do it this time either, I&#39;m an experienced leader and I do know how to advertise and get players etc.

Soo... Does this sound good to you?

Make sure you&#39;re adding the swedish one.

Age requirement: 16+ 
(Can be overlooked if you&#39;re good at what you&#39;re doing &amp; if you&#39;re mature enough to handle the responsibility)
Be able to speak proper english. 
Be dedicated to the project!

You&#39;ll be rewarded a moderator/admin position in-game.

I&#39;m not looking for young unexperienced staff members, be mature and be willing to spend time. Lets make something huge together!
