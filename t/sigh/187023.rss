    <description>I used to play videogames like crazy. I&#39;d play for so long my hands would start to hurt and cramp up. It would usually take me a day to beat any game because I had no life. But now, I&#39;ve been playing them less and less, which is weirding me out because I love them.

I guess they&#39;re not as fun as they used to be. I&#39;m still gonna play Guitar Hero, which is pretty much the best game I&#39;ve ever bought.</description>

              <p>Same here. My life was based on video games from age 4-11. Now for the past 3-4 years, I just play some halo if friends come  over. Or I’ll play Guitar Hero once a week.</p>
