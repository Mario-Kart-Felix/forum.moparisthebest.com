    <description>Well I have already written a crawler, and a mouse macro/auto clicker, but I was thinking just a moment ago, why not use image detection to earn the whereabouts on-screen where to click and such, instead of color detection? I assume it would basically be the same thing, but instead of taking individual colors and using them, why not load the clients textures from the client and use them directly? Is the cache encrypted like the client is? I know I did mess with the 317 cache ages ago, but I never even tried dicking around with the 508 cache or anything newer then that. Although if is encrypted you could always use edge detection to extract parts of textures, and make databases. I&#39;m just wondering about this shit, so I made a thread. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s in the wrong section but if it is I apologize in advance.</description>
