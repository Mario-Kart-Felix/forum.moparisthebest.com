    <title>Downloading selection</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/downloading-selection/54009</link>
    <description>I wanted to know if there was a software which lets you select which files you want to download that are inside a rar or zip file. Right now i am using internet download manager but it downloads the whole thing. eg. i was looking for a key for kaspersky internet security and there was a rar file that had the kaspersky setup and the key. but i already have kaspersky installed and i just wanted the key. So is there something that lets you download a single file instead of the whole pack?</description>
