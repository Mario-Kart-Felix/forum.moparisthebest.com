    <title>Important. Read All</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/important-read-all/17580</link>
    <description>So besides the fact that my day has been ok. I see that Wall of Fir has posted his 10th or maybe 11th time about him leaving. I&#39;m just here to tell you bud, that CM is a crapload of work; I dont hate you nor dislike you but I just dont like the fact that you are wasting bandwidth and time posting your pointless threads. I&#39;m not trying to be mean, but I would appericate it as many others would too, if you would stop your mindless ranting about people and accept the hatred as a small dose of Reality. People are always going to hate you and thats how life is going to flow. You just need to learn who to make friends with and who to ignore if you continue to waste your life away trying to make everyone like you then you&#39;ll realize too late that people will always hate you and that you have been wasting your life away trying to make them like you or at least not hate you. This is a generally thing on every community, the more you help out and the more you get people to respect you the greater the chance you have of becoming a better person and member of the great community. There is no need to make threads or put things in your sig about who hates you and who doesnt hate you. You just need to realize that life isnt about who hates you and who loves you; Its about who is going to help you in your greatest time of need and if you have someone like that then you&#39;ll be alright because no matter what happens you&#39;ll always be able to to count on that person. That is all for tonight.</description>
