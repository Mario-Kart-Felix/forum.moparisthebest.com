    <description>I don&#39;t post in here very often, but I came across this group several weeks ago. They&#39;re graduates and soon-to-be graduates from Sydney Australia&#39;s Conservatorium of Music, which is basically the most prestigious music school we have.

So far they&#39;ve done classical arrangements for a number of pop songs. I know that will probably turn some of you off immediately, but for everyone else check them out here:

In my opinion some of the songs may as well be their own; the arrangements are brilliant.
Here&#39;s a few favourites of mine:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIziWfCvNjM -- Khe Sanh by Cold Chisel
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLpmaWEUobI -- Only girl in the world by Rihanna
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FHaGG4a08 -- Born this way by Lady Gaga</description>
