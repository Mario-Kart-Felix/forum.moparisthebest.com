    <title>Looking for some (probably) simple help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-some-probably-simple-help/354464</link>
    <description>2 years ago, I had my own 2 up and running servers, but the the thing that differs then from now, is that those servers were only on moparscape. People just had to go onto the client and type in my info, and connect to it. But now, I want to have my own client, and I&#39;ve gone through the forums serveral times and can&#39;t seem to find the proper help. I&#39;ve gone through and downloaded several of the sources and clients provided for everyone to use, but there are still 2 things I&#39;m confused about.

1 - How do I turn that client into something that others can download, and connect right to me. I feel like if I just turn around and send the client to someone without changing something, it obviously won&#39;t connect to my server if they push run.

2 - What is it that I have to change to make the client automatically connect to my server. My ports and everything are forwarded. I&#39;m all set on that stuff.

Thanks in advance for any help.</description>
