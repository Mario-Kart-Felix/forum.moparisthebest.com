[CENTER][COLOR=RED]Latest Update: 6/26/14 - 9:00 PM[/COLOR][/CENTER]

Note: the game takes place in [i]just[/i] the islands that RuneScape contains (including underground and other various locations), so that content can be packed into every little object and the gaming experience is a lot different, and more enjoyable.

[B]Q: What is &quot;Stonewall&quot; and what should we know before playing? Plans and ideas?[/B]
[I]
A: Our key plan for the server is to create an experience unique and diverse for players. Yes, that means you guys reading this right now. I don&#39;t mean any garbage like, &quot;omg custom items and new donator supplies and shops omg.&quot; I&#39;m talking about something that most servers don&#39;t even utilize. We want to emulate an environment in which players can explore and have plenty of game time to try out new things. This consists of many new content ideas (such as quests, a story line, tons of miscellaneous features, loads of interactive content, and et cetera), not to mention updates as frequently as we can develop them. This game will require a large team for development and hours of work put into it. I don&#39;t even expect a type of release to the public anytime soon. Enough of my blabbering talk, let&#39;s get on with the first and for most basic ideas.[/I]

[B]Q: You say unique huh? Will there even be a storyline to the game?[/B]

[I]A: I&#39;m glad you asked that question, because yes. There will be infact! We haven&#39;t decided a final idea but here is a quick mock-up for a quick storyline idea to get the feel of it.[/I]

You wake up stranded on some foreign island that you don&#39;t recognize (Entrana). You notice that you don&#39;t remember your name or who you even are. A lone tramp walks up to you and wonders who you are, because he&#39;s never seen you in these parts. He tells you a story of one particular storm, which by some odd chances had occurred last night. He suggests maybe you were on a boat when the storm hit and you were washed up on the shore. The tramp acknowledges your confusion, mainly because there is a huge gash in your head which seemed to have caused a concussion referring to his loss of memory. He then tells you that it&#39;s better if you go talk to people around the island and maybe they can figure out why you&#39;re here or who you are. (the story continues as you do quests, tasks, and research to find out who you are or what you can do to help the others in need)

[B]Q: Why was hunger your first choice addition to the game?[/B] 

[I]A: First of all, hunger is an extremely easy thing to contain and add new side effects for. We chose this because we think that the basic health system in RuneScape is quite cheesy. As in RuneScape, your health basically stays the same unless you have some sort of status condition. We decided to utilize that idea and create the basics of hunger. You start out with simply 0% of hunger or starvation. The task then uses this so that each minute you gain one percent of hunger. Once you a hit certain point of percentage, you will receive some sort of status condition. In this case let&#39;s use poison as an example. You are nearing to a low 80% of starvation before you are fully starving. As soon as you reach that point, you become poisoned and start to gradually lose health. Once you hit a hunger percentage of 100, resulting in an absolute death from starvation. Food, drinks, and all the basic consumables will be able to gain your hunger percentage restored, just as you&#39;re doing with your health. This makes the game slightly more tricky and more to pay attention to.[/I]

○ [COLOR=red]Gain less experience[/COLOR]
○ [COLOR=red]Hit strength, accuracy, and defense is reduced[/COLOR]

[B]Q: What is so great about titles? I mean, they&#39;re just a text by your name.[/B]

[I]A: That&#39;s what you would think. We&#39;d like to use titles for more than just the basic &quot;title&quot; of it. We would like to use these as rewards from quests, achievements, and miscellaneous tasks from NPC&#39;s. We want to do more for the use of titles. We want to make titles grant access to new locations, exclusive costumes, rewards, dungeons, privileges, and so on. Each title will be obtainable in different ways, depending on what you do. Also, each title will be colored based on what you did to receive that specific title. For example, quest titles will be in the color [COLOR=teal]blue[/COLOR], achievement titles will be in the color [COLOR=orange]orange[/COLOR]. Basically just like that.[/I]

○ [COLOR=red]Title names[/COLOR]
○ [COLOR=red]Privileges[/COLOR]
○ [COLOR=red]Location unlocking[/COLOR]
○ [COLOR=red]Rewards[/COLOR]
○ [COLOR=red]New creatures[/COLOR]
○ [COLOR=red]Chat titles (such as in the chatbox, or private messaging)[/COLOR]

[B]Q: What are ranks used for exactly? What will they be for?[/B]

[I]A: The use of ranks in Stonewall is very cool actually. Instead of having the world completely open to access, we created it so that you are required to have certain ranks to access certain areas and specific features. Each island that is accessible will have it&#39;s own ranking system which rewards ranks based on the tasks you do for NPC&#39;s and the achievements that you accomplish in that region. A task is no different than a mini-quest or side quest. It puts more of the &#39;goal&#39; factor into the game, giving players something to set for and spend more time playing on Stonewall.

Note: Ancient stones are a second currency for the game. They are a lot harder to receive, in which the items and features you can purchase with them are a lot more useful, and collectable. Not to mention the maximum amount of ranks you can receive for each island/region is 30.[/I]

[B]Q: Will Combat be unique? Anything new or special about it?[/B]

[I]A: As of this moment, we will be recreating the combat to match RuneScape&#39;s in 2007. We have no current plans for any extra combat features at this time.[/I]

○ [COLOR=green]Attacking NPC&#39;s[/COLOR]
○ [COLOR=green]Combat formulas[/COLOR]
○ [COLOR=orange]Special attacks[/COLOR]
○ [COLOR=green]Magic attacks/formula[/COLOR]
○ [COLOR=green]Range attacks/formula[/COLOR]
○ [COLOR=orange]NPC combat[/COLOR]
○ [COLOR=green]Multi-areas[/COLOR]
○ [COLOR=orange]Eating food[/COLOR]
○ [COLOR=green]Consuming drinks[/COLOR]
○ [COLOR=orange]Status conditions[/COLOR]
○ [COLOR=orange]Attack styles[/COLOR]

[B]Q: Will there be any additions to skills or new skills?[/B]

[I]Additions? Possibly after all the skills are complete, but I&#39;m not totally sure on a new skill. That&#39;s quite a handful. Maybe if we have a poll on it in the future? Heck, I don&#39;t know. But yeah, our main concern is making sure all the skills are accessible and more importantly completely trainable (use of all features).[/I]

              <p>[CENTER]<img src="http://i.imgur.com/rrcjhYq.png" alt width="" height="">[/CENTER]<br>
[CENTER][COLOR=RED]Latest Update: 6/26/14 - 9:00 PM[/COLOR][/CENTER]</p>
<p>Note: the game takes place in <span class="bbcode-i">just</span> the islands that RuneScape contains (including underground and other various locations), so that content can be packed into every little object and the gaming experience is a lot different, and more enjoyable.</p>
<p>[B]Q: What is “Stonewall” and what should we know before playing? Plans and ideas?[/B]<br>
[I]<br>
A: Our key plan for the server is to create an experience unique and diverse for players. Yes, that means you guys reading this right now. I don’t mean any garbage like, “omg custom items and new donator supplies and shops omg.” I’m talking about something that most servers don’t even utilize. We want to emulate an environment in which players can explore and have plenty of game time to try out new things. This consists of many new content ideas (such as quests, a story line, tons of miscellaneous features, loads of interactive content, and et cetera), not to mention updates as frequently as we can develop them. This game will require a large team for development and hours of work put into it. I don’t even expect a type of release to the public anytime soon. Enough of my blabbering talk, let’s get on with the first and for most basic ideas.[/I]</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nNZMMh8.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>[B]Q: You say unique huh? Will there even be a storyline to the game?[/B]</p>
<p>[I]A: I’m glad you asked that question, because yes. There will be infact! We haven’t decided a final idea but here is a quick mock-up for a quick storyline idea to get the feel of it.[/I]</p>
<p>You wake up stranded on some foreign island that you don’t recognize (Entrana). You notice that you don’t remember your name or who you even are. A lone tramp walks up to you and wonders who you are, because he’s never seen you in these parts. He tells you a story of one particular storm, which by some odd chances had occurred last night. He suggests maybe you were on a boat when the storm hit and you were washed up on the shore. The tramp acknowledges your confusion, mainly because there is a huge gash in your head which seemed to have caused a concussion referring to his loss of memory. He then tells you that it’s better if you go talk to people around the island and maybe they can figure out why you’re here or who you are. (the story continues as you do quests, tasks, and research to find out who you are or what you can do to help the others in need)</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Jism8BH.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>[B]Q: Why was hunger your first choice addition to the game?[/B]</p>
<p>[I]A: First of all, hunger is an extremely easy thing to contain and add new side effects for. We chose this because we think that the basic health system in RuneScape is quite cheesy. As in RuneScape, your health basically stays the same unless you have some sort of status condition. We decided to utilize that idea and create the basics of hunger. You start out with simply 0% of hunger or starvation. The task then uses this so that each minute you gain one percent of hunger. Once you a hit certain point of percentage, you will receive some sort of status condition. In this case let’s use poison as an example. You are nearing to a low 80% of starvation before you are fully starving. As soon as you reach that point, you become poisoned and start to gradually lose health. Once you hit a hunger percentage of 100, resulting in an absolute death from starvation. Food, drinks, and all the basic consumables will be able to gain your hunger percentage restored, just as you’re doing with your health. This makes the game slightly more tricky and more to pay attention to.[/I]</p>
<p>○ [COLOR=green]Hunger increasing[/COLOR]<br>
○ [COLOR=green]Hunger restoring (supported by food and drinks)[/COLOR]<br>
○ [COLOR=green]Poisoning at 80% of starvation[/COLOR]<br>

○ [COLOR=red]Hit strength, accuracy, and defense is reduced[/COLOR]</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/aGjnEYl.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>[B]Q: What is so great about titles? I mean, they’re just a text by your name.[/B]</p>
<p>[I]A: That’s what you would think. We’d like to use titles for more than just the basic “title” of it. We would like to use these as rewards from quests, achievements, and miscellaneous tasks from NPC’s. We want to do more for the use of titles. We want to make titles grant access to new locations, exclusive costumes, rewards, dungeons, privileges, and so on. Each title will be obtainable in different ways, depending on what you do. Also, each title will be colored based on what you did to receive that specific title. For example, quest titles will be in the color [COLOR=teal]blue[/COLOR], achievement titles will be in the color [COLOR=orange]orange[/COLOR]. Basically just like that.[/I]</p>
<p>○ [COLOR=red]Title names[/COLOR]<br>
○ [COLOR=red]Privileges[/COLOR]<br>
○ [COLOR=red]Location unlocking[/COLOR]<br>
○ [COLOR=red]Rewards[/COLOR]<br>
○ [COLOR=red]New creatures[/COLOR]<br>
○ [COLOR=red]Chat titles (such as in the chatbox, or private messaging)[/COLOR]</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9BD500D.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>[B]Q: What are ranks used for exactly? What will they be for?[/B]</p>
<p>[I]A: The use of ranks in Stonewall is very cool actually. Instead of having the world completely open to access, we created it so that you are required to have certain ranks to access certain areas and specific features. Each island that is accessible will have it’s own ranking system which rewards ranks based on the tasks you do for NPC’s and the achievements that you accomplish in that region. A task is no different than a mini-quest or side quest. It puts more of the ‘goal’ factor into the game, giving players something to set for and spend more time playing on Stonewall.</p>
<p>Note: Ancient stones are a second currency for the game. They are a lot harder to receive, in which the items and features you can purchase with them are a lot more useful, and collectable. Not to mention the maximum amount of ranks you can receive for each island/region is 30.[/I]</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0dgx41a.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>[B]Q: Will Combat be unique? Anything new or special about it?[/B]</p>
<p>[I]A: As of this moment, we will be recreating the combat to match RuneScape’s in 2007. We have no current plans for any extra combat features at this time.[/I]</p>

○ [COLOR=orange]Eating food[/COLOR]<br>
○ [COLOR=green]Consuming drinks[/COLOR]<br>
○ [COLOR=orange]Status conditions[/COLOR]<br>
○ [COLOR=orange]Attack styles[/COLOR]</p>
<p>[B]Q: Will there be any additions to skills or new skills?[/B]</p>
<p>[I]Additions? Possibly after all the skills are complete, but I’m not totally sure on a new skill. That’s quite a handful. Maybe if we have a poll on it in the future? Heck, I don’t know. But yeah, our main concern is making sure all the skills are accessible and more importantly completely trainable (use of all features).[/I]</p>
