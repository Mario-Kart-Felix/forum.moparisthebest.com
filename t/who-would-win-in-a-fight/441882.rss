IMO I think The Thing would win simply because he is solid rock. Rocks are tougher than muscle, although Hulk does rip tanks in half…</p>

<li>agree</li>
<li>wolverine can cut the fat, unless it’s the 3rd form, which can destroy almost the whole world</li>
<li>Disagree, roger is equivalent to whitebeard, and whitebeard can destroy and create earthquakes and seaquakes which seems just so much better than just being fast. Whitebeard is known to be the strongest man in the world<br>
4.DISAGREE, HULK gets Hurt by jeeps thrown at him. Goku destroys planets</li>
<li>don’t know<br>
6.agreed</li>
<li>I don’t understand that debate, and is a stupid debate</li>
<li>kraken. It’s a fucking legend and is god worthy beast. several thousands time larger than a giant squid Plus giant squids get sold in markets. Just dwarfs it. stupid debate and answer</li>
<li>Don’t know much about both, I played ssb for ganondorf and watched fantastic 4 for the thing Terrible debate imo.</li>
<li>Samus, She spins cooler, and she appears in 3d games more often. I like what’s underneath the suit better than megamans</li>
<li>Bruce lee.</li>
