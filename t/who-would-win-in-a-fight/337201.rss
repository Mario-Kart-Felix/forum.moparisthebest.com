Well did you see mayweather vs big guy (w/e his name is)<br>
[/quote]<br>
That was completely staged, that wrestler (I believe his name is ‘Big Show’ or something), could step on Mayweather… Floyd wouldn’t have a chance in the world. Pound for pound, Floyd would whipe the floor with him - but not in a fight.</p>

<p>uh thanks guys =P but for real =P<br>
and Yz85Racer, not if the wrestler doesnt know where to hit unless he gets lucky.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s simple shit, 4 key areas to hit:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nose</li>
<li>Jaw</li>
<li>Eyes</li>
<li>Temple<br>
(You could include back of the head, but in any professional fighting style you’re not allowed to strike the back of the head.) Boxing doesn’t teach you where to punch, it teaches you how to punch.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, you have your mind set on looking at it like you were placing a bet. Ask yourself what this fight is going to do… is it going to the ground or standing up? Obviously the wrestler’s main objective is to get the opponent to the ground, however wrestling is all about power, and big powerful slams… On the ground, the one with the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu will run rings around the wrestler, especially if he has grappling knowledge combined with it. Standing up, from the styles you mentioned it really is any mans guess. Even then, I’d put my money on the 2nd fighter because of his other martial art experience.[/quote]<br>
haha thanks and im the other guy, so i might fight this kid =P and i do have grappling experiance</p>
