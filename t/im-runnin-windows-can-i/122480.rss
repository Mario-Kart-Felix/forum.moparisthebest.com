<p>It’s fine.  I guess wi-fi will just have to decide for himself, because there is no clear winner.  Each has it’s own benefits, and that’s what’s behind capitalism.  So choose Windows or Linux.  Either way, you’re leading the fight against communism. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>And for the record, I am no way a Windows geek, if it came across that way.  I have Kubuntu and Windows on my PC, and I’m getting a MacBook eventually also.</p>

I’m not trying to make this in to one, however, it is STILL possible to get unwanted spyware under Windows unless your ridiculously careful and ONLY go to trusted sites, but if you want to look at it from the legal point of view, at any time when you download an illegal version of a program, you do risk getting into legal trouble.</p>
<p>But yes, I agree, if your experienced enough not to get viruses, there’s a small chance you will get one. I mean, I had one for a few months(only a small thing to log what websites I went to(strange, I know, definitly not a keylogger)).<br>

<p>Oh I understand, I was just saying I didn’t want this to develop into a massive war.  And yea I understand Linux is much safer, but, given the learning curve, is it all that much better?

Trust me, it’s worth it if you put effort in to it. Lets see, you will NEVER get viruses(VERY, VERY VERY <em>VERY</em> rarely out of stupidity), spyware, or shit like that.
