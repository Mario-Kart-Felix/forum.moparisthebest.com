    <title>Is There a Point?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-there-a-point/448906</link>
    <description>Is there a point in upgrading this system for gaming?

Intel Core i5-2500k
Gigabyte Z68X-UD3H-B3 Rev 1.3
Sapphire Radeon 7950 1000 MHz
Lite-On DVDRW LH-20A1S
WD Caviar Blue 250GB Hard Drive (had one lying around)
Corsair Carbide 500R
PC Power and Cooling 950W (don&#39;t ask; my urge was high back then)
Mushkin Enhanced Chronos 120GB SSD
Crucial Ballistix sport 2x4GB

or should I wait for Haswell next year? I wish I had waited a month for the GTX 670 before building this, lol.</description>

              <p>Then why make a thread about an issue like this? You’re asking if there is any point in upgrading your machine. You got your answer, which is no. No need to add extra dots to your sentences to make it sound like you’re being sarcastic yourself.</p>
