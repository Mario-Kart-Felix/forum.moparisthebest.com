    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-feel-like-ive-been-living-under-a-rock/3603</link>
    <description>Hello everyone,

I had left Runescape and SCAR for quite some time, 265 days according to the last time I had logged in RS. As I logged on earlier today, I also tried to find the Kaitnieks board, only to find them missing... After a bit of research I ended up here. I haven&#39;t taken much time to read yet, and wondered if someone cared to explain, or point me to the right place to catch up on the news a bit.

Why did the Kainieks site close down?
Is Kaitnieks still around?
What was this Aryan thing that is now &quot;dead&quot;? A client? A proxy? Something else altogether?
What&#39;s the state of the art? Still SCAR? Something else?
Has SCAR been updated much?
Any major things Jagex has done lately?

That sort of stuff.

Thanks in advance,

Darkshado</description>

<span class="bbcode-b"> Don’t listen to Pwnd, it wasen’t Aryan, or maybe it was, but not a big deal.<br>
The reason he closed the forums, it was because he was getting a daughter, and he was stating to get more busy, and jagex were starting problems with him, so he quit everything. He would stand and fight, and probably win if he didn’t have a daughter and werent so busy. </span><br>
Is Kaitnieks still around?<br>

              <p>Aryan was almost a flawless bot but it eventually became buggy. Aryan rocked runescape, boosted its economy however you can see at lease 5 bots at rimmington mine and 20 at ess mines. It was huge, you could see bots everywhere. But using aryan you would have got banned within a week.This caused jagex ot introduce many things, they even made colour changes every loading time while playing rs. Recently jagex updated their entire engine, this killed aryan and you can barely see any bots. The update also included new randoms which SCAR wasnt able to cope with. Right now all we have is SRL. Also after kaitnieks went down many communities arose, many of them having wars with ddosing. Fagex and rscn both have gone.</p>

<p>What did Aryan do to piss everyone off? (I can understand Jagex, but everyone?)<br>
I was around on Kaitniek’s board when 2.03 was released.<br>
What’s the situation with includes? I haven’t seen any mention of Squig and SI, what replaced them?<br>
What’s SRL?<br>
I’ll take a look around for info on the new randoms, I’ve seen the “Sandwich Lady” teleport someone but that’s about it.</p>
