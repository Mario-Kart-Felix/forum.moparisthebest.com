    <title>RuneScape Discussion Rules [Updated March 12, 2013]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-discussion-rules-updated-march-12-2013/347456</link>
    <description>This section is for discussing anything related to the official RuneScape game (EOC), existing bots written by others etc. No private server discussion is allowed, there are other boards for that.

[b]We [u]do not[/u] allow the selling of accounts on this site. You may however give away accounts for [u]free[/u].[/b]

Also if you wish to write your own bot, updater, loader, or anything of that nature post that in the [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php#c4]RuneScape2 development[/url] board on moparisthebest.com (same user/pass as here).

Hope you enjoy it.


[ol][li][url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,354311.0.html]Global forum rules[/url] apply.[/li]
[li]No discussing loaning of money or items (exception is the built-in runescape lending system, since you can&#39;t be scammed with it).[/li]
[li]No buying or selling of anything outside of the RuneScape trading system. This includes asking for price checks on things you wish to sell for real money or other forms of currency.[/li]
[li]Buying, selling, and trading using the official RuneScape trading system is allowed, as long as no other forms of currency are exchanged. The staff reserve the right to remove posts and/or threads if they deem the trade is a scam or illegitimate for any reason.[/li]
[li]No &#39;I got hacked&#39; posts/threads. Begging for accounts or items for any reason does not look good on you.[/li]
[li]No &#39;Free RS gp giveaway threads&#39; unless you pre-verify it with a moderator.[/li]
[li]No discussion of account hacking or recovering. If it isn&#39;t yours, don&#39;t take it.[/li]
[li]No old school server discussion, all 2007 server discussion must go [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,251.0.html]here[/url].[/li][/ol]</description>

<p>How about anyone who wants to be a part of this recovery group do it secretly and don’t talk about it? You’re recovering an account that isn’t yours.</p>
<p>This will get you punished: “Hey everybody, please rep me!”<br>
This won’t get you punished: Asking for rep privately (and hope you don’t get reported).</p>

Why ask for a price check on something you know you can’t sell here? Why not ask for a price check someplace where the selling is actually allowed? Not to mention that these accounts were probably recovered anyway from what I’ve seen in the past. I think people are correct in saying that they are only doing it to advertise the accounts they are trying to sell, in a way that doesn’t break the rules at the time. If people actually thought this was a decent place to get price checks, why would they not do it for other things here like their PC’s and other valuables?</p>
<p>I can remember only one topic where someone was asking for a price check for something besides a RS account, and the person went ahead and PM’d people (or posted it in the topic, I don’t remember) the thread/place he was selling it. It’s a loophole people are using to advertise their sales here, when they could actually look at the market themselves at the place they actually will do the selling.</p>
<p>EDIT - Also feel free to remove it if you think it’s too much, I didn’t even add it as a new rule, it was just an ‘extension’ to no buying/selling. So if it doesn’t fall under that, just remove that part, and we can add it as a new rule if we decide to<br>

<p>I wish you would have waited for another staff member’s opinion, as you said originally.</p>
<p>I believe there is validity in price checking accounts and items. There is a definite line between advertising a sale and asking for helpful information from the community. These questions were asked of Moparisthebest when he set up the section a few years ago. The staff then agreed it is fine to discuss the sale of anything and everything RuneScape related, but it is against the rules to simply conduct the sale on here. We don’t allow selling of anything RuneScape-related, and that will remain. As for requesting price values of RuneScape property, many of the members here are well-educated in that area, and can provide good advice for selling.</p>
<p>I remain of the opinion to allow it. I have yet to see it abused to the point of someone actually trying to sell their account on here. (not including the occasional blatant sales topic)</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/all">@all</a> preceding discussion regarding the recovery rule: there are some misconceptions I believe need to be cleared up. We already know the motives of the people trying to recover accounts, that’s rather easy to see. What none of us know are the motives of the owners of those accounts. Who’s to say they are never going to play again? There is no definitive proof in the world (other than actually knowing the owner) which can justify an act of recovering an account which does not belong to you. I consider my original analogy to still be true, and I consider recovering accounts to be nothing more than theft.</p>
<p>If you have yet more evidence to provide to try and change our minds, I welcome it.</p>
<p>Edit: I would like additional staff members to comment on the rule change for price checking accounts, if you have time. Thanks. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
