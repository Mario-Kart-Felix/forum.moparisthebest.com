    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/command-issues-with-ddsspeced-server-found-thank-you/249307</link>
    <description>Hello, 
     My problem is that i can not find where the commands are for the server source ddsspeced. I am modifying it completly, hardley anything is going to be the same... If anyone can help me find out where the commands are i&#39;d greatly appreciate it. (Yes, i have looked in client.java... and still can&#39;t find where they are.)

Thanks,
Weownzscape</description>
