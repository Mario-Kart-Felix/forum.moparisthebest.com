    <title>Where did i screw up?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-did-i-screw-up/363794</link>
    <description>I set up a no-ip
i went on my router page and opened port 43594.
i download an open port checker from portforward.com
i test 43594 and it says its open.
i test it again at canyouseeme.org
it says success.
i open my source run.bat and it says port already in use?
so i close out port checker and my run.bat.
i open my run.bat and it says its online.
i test my port and it says its locked by another application.
So my port is only open when port checker from port forward is open.
and when i have that open it wont let my run.bat run.
Why?</description>

              <p>From what i understood, it says itâ€™s locked by another application, meaning that your run.bat is working and you should try having a friend or two login to test if it works.</p>
