    <title>What&#39;s the wait?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whats-the-wait/269599</link>
    <description>Well, I have noticed lately how much the &#39;Users Online&#39; stat has changed. I used to always see at least one or two MoparScape Moderators online. The Download Section has been receiving more advertising threads every day, and the Server Help Section is being posted in with questions not being related to servers.

Anyway, lets get to the point. Moderators such as jme, Taharok, etc have mentioned the staff choosing new moderators. This was said by both quite awhile ago; jme even mentioning it would happen &#39;soon&#39;. Jme had even said he didn&#39;t know the reason there is a hold-up. Are you staff members willing to share this information? I completely understand if not, I was just wondering.

Please feel free to ask any questions.</description>
