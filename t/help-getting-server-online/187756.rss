    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-getting-server-online/187756</link>
    <description>I have been following the Stickied guide to making a server and i have it all done except for the last bit, getting the server online. I have a no-ip, i did the client.java CTRL H and CTRL F to switch names and make mods and admins, but i just need to know how to get it online on silabsoft, please help?

I have many game clients, and windows vista if that matters..

I have done port fowarding and everything i just cannot seem to get it online, this is what happens..  I also have JDK
