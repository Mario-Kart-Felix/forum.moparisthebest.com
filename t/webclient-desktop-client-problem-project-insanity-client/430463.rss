    <description>The problem that the client wont load for other people but me and my brother on a different laptop both could get on it.
when they load the webclient it says error loading Click here for details and the client.jar when people click it it says could not find main class client i&#39;ve jarred and signed perfectly it works perfectly fine for me and my brother but i&#39;ve asked 6 people if they wanted to try it and it all comes back with the same results every time. i&#39;ve noticed that both me and my brother have jdk installed but other people do not. if anyone could come up with a fix or at least tell me what the problem is then i&#39;d be willing to give server credits and maybe 10% of all server donations into your paypal. Thanks.

Heres a picture of the problem people are facing with the client
