    <title>Advice about my next move</title>

    <description>My dad has brought me a VAIO laptop earlier this year. I have been playing around and added a linux to a dual boot. I deleted the linux partition and then I had a GRUB error. After some time of reading the documentation I have found out that VAIO has a recovery tool. I enter that tool (it is in safe mode so it was accessible. This tool only is activated when your computer is missing something. I used the tool to wipe all my partitions and reset it to windows vista. After the process had finished, I tried to boot again but I still got a GRUB error. I just yelled in frustration that it did not re-write the bootloader. After a week, I had called up VAIO support. I told them that the bootloader was missing and I need a vista CD for the fix (according to my google searching). I have the warranty, and according to their &#39;free of charge&#39; repair I fit all their requirements. The operator tells me to go to a VAIO center. He tells me it will cost $65 for them to re-write my bootloader. I ask him if I can actually have the vista CD because I paid for it and I would feel safer if I had it in actual form instead of binary source. He said no. &quot;When they fix your computer, go to a VAIO backup tool and it will give you all the files you need&quot;. I told him, it doesn&#39;t have all the files I need if it did I wouldn&#39;t be asking him. He tells me I need to buy a new disk in a shop for it. I tell him about the warranty guidelines and he just says I am sorry but I can&#39;t help you, send your computer to a VAIO center. Firstly, I have to pay to send the laptop to them, then I need to pay for them to write a bootloader, then I have to pay for them to send it to me. 
What should be my next move?
Right now I am sending an email to their administration to complain that I brought my CD and the laptop and I want to my products. Then I might threaten them with a lawsuit.</description>

<p>Just reinstall GRUB and use that to boot windows.  You can do this a few different ways, I would install linux on a small partition, but its up to you.  You certainly don’t need a windows cd to fix your computer.</p>

<p>Well one of the core drivers doesn’t start up because it thinks that its damaged so it doesn’t load further than the loading screen. I have tried re-installing linux and doing the above. I am currently on linux.</p>
