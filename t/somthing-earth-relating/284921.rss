    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/somthing-earth-relating/284921</link>
    <description>Well guys, I&#39;ve got somthing interesting to tell all of MoparScape, and am very eager to let you all know. Now, you might not think it&#39;s interesting, or start saying &#39;Who cares&#39;, but it&#39;s the truth.


The reason why the World will end, is because of the Evilness that people Have.
The Evilness in the World has been going on since the beginning of time, and is spreading very fast. The Evilness is a thing, a spirit, not a person. It&#39;s a thing, that can possess your body that makes you Sin, unwantingly. Cancer is an Evil, Smoking is an Evil, Addiction is an Evil, stuff like that. It was started by [b]Satan Lucifer[/b], but Man it&#39;self allowed it to grow, and cause all of this.

 
It&#39;s up to you to stop all of it. Get baptized. Baptizing won&#39;t do nothing but defend your body more than how it already is. It symbolizes you Follow God&#39;s rules, and will obey at all time.


It is said in the Bible that God has a blanket that he has, covering Earth. The blanket is located in the Atmosphere, in between Earth, and the Sun. The blanket is an invisible force field, that blocks the Sun for burning the earth. There is a small circle-like hole in the force field Scientists found (theres another name for the Blanket), and that it&#39;s getting bigger by the moment. The hole is caused by the Evilness.


It&#39;s up to you. If you truley within your heart believe, you should follow of what I say and pass this on. Oh and, the Bible also states: [b]&#39;144,000 at Purest of Heart will remain&#39;[/b] for when the world ends.



What are your beliefs? And/or do you believe this? Do you believe God? Post what you want.



If the world does end, will you sit there a panic knowing you won&#39;t survive? Or will you spend the last, thanking God for what he&#39;s done, and spending it with your family? Think about it.

[b]Below this Line is edited.[/b]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is said that the world will end in 2012, very many times. I don&#39;t think it won&#39;t, because in the Bible it sates: &#39;No one will know, when the day is to come. But when it does come, you will know even if standing at your front door. Only the Wise will know. However, the people Doomed with Wickedness will not yet to come, of the gates of Heavan.&#39; This means that no one will know. I think the world will end at an unexpected time, near and close to 2012, but not to the excact and catch everyone by surprise.</description>

              <p>Ok people of moparscape, today I bring you great news. You might say “who cares?” but it’s the truth.</p>
<p>In 3 days from now, the lolipop unicorn from La La Land will descend to Earth. He is going to rid all of the evil in our planet and save us from our doom. And anyone who doesn’t believe the unicorn is real, is part of the evil and they must be exterminated by the lolipop unicorn.</p>
<p>When he rids all of the evil, the <span class="bbcode-b">ozone layer</span> will be repaired because there is no evil. So as long as you accept this, you can now sleep safely at night.</p>

<p>During those times, it was said that the world will end. It was said just because of how the dates looked, like 6/6/06, and 1/1/00. They just thought it would end because the dates looked suspicous, that’s all.<br>

<p>Maybe, because everyone believes that the world will end anyways, people just stop giving a fuck. And they all accept the fact that that day is their last day. Now, because everyone believes this, and expects something unbelievable to happen, what if nothing happens? What if it is just another day. And the world AS WE KNEW IT, changed because everyone believed that the world would end on December 21, 2012, and it really didn’t. Thus disproving all theories and hypothesis(Not really sure how to spell the plural &gt;.&lt;).</p>
<p>Now, there are many theories that “God” will come down, and smite the non believers, only those “Pure of Heart” will survive, blah blah blah. But if we are all born sinners, not even the most innocent of children, is really innocent. Thus everyone will die, blah blah blah, whatever whatever. I mean COME ON! The most logical definition of Christianity is the Belief that some cosmic jewish zombie can make you live forever by symbolically eating his flesh and telepathically telling him he’s your master, so that he can rid your soul of an evil force that exists because a rib-woman was convinced by a talking snake to eat from a magical tree. Doesn’t make much sense no does it?</p>
<p>Anyways, the point is: No one will know what’s going to happen on that day, until that day comes.</p>

<p>It’s not up to the ‘Mayan Calender’, it’s up to God to decide. And yes, it is going to end. It’s going to end the current age it’s in, (I think were in the 6th Age, or maybe 5th, not sure). Everytime a new age comes, the world changes in a different way. Such as the first age, (Dinosaur times), when it’s Age ended, the Earth changed in manny ways.</p>
<p>The Earth will end very manny things.</p>

<p>Anyway, blaming ‘evil’ for the worlds problems is pure laziness and distracts people from the real issues. OP, how old are you? You sound pretty naive. Religion and beliefs are great and all, just don’t let it get them the way of what’s important - what we can extrapolate, prove and hypothesize. Religion and science don’t contradict each other (yet) so there’s no reason for you to imply they do, you’re just gonna make people angry.</p>

It was happening by itself, we just sped up the process(btw its HUMANS)

              <p>2012 the world ends. Is this true or not?</p>
<p>humans have been carelessly been destroying the earth and as i have been researching since i am very interested in the rumor of ‘2012’ i found to see that on december 21st 2012, the world will end. Some rumors<br>
is because of some calenders found from those ppl long ago, proven from researchers that the book specifcly ends on december 21st 2012. why believe a calendar? Even if it was true that the world would end on 2012, long ago wouldn’t 2012 be umm im not sure but like 1992 today in our new world? 666 was proven to be wrong, what is so different?</p>
<ol>
<li>global warming was caused by humens ( it can be stopped )</li>
<li>long ago those ppl idk wtf they called but they said war would be a sign to the end of the world. The war in iraq with america can end easily if we pull troops out and begin to make peace with the mid-east.</li>
<li>the economy. People are saying it’s the end of the world because of the depression or w.e that we are in now but we’ve been through it and made it out. since we had expierience and know what it’s capable of, it should be easier to get out of today as we have better and new technology.</li>
