    <title>Loading with jarred clients</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/loading-with-jarred-clients/202378</link>
    <description>I have my client successfully jarred, but I&#39;ve been trying to figure out why I cannot get my class51 to load up (contains awt etc.), instead, my Frame_Sub1 loads.  How can I get my client to load up my menubar etc.  I am thinking it has something to do with applet_sub1, but I&#39;m not sure.

Note: I have already tried making a batch file that is:
[code]@echo off
title Matt&#39;s Client
java -Xmx500m -jar noob.jar Class51 30 0 highmem members 32
pause[/code]

Pictures for those of you who have no clue, but may be able to help:
