    <title>SCAR SCRIPT for finding Mystery Pic Answer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/scar-script-for-finding-mystery-pic-answer/198507</link>
    <description>Hey, can someone make a scar script that uses the mystery pic and searches through the entire neopets image database to find one that matches the color of the mystery pic?

i know this is possible because someone made the script already but he&#39;s not sharing : /</description>
