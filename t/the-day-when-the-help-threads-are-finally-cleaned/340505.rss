    <description>When will this come, or will it come?

No one searches the help sections, because there are so many keywords people have used for the last 4 years, its nearly impossible to find an answer.

Most of the questions have been answer numerous times, but thats why you just make a sticky for numerously asked questions.

Whats your opinion on this? Want, don&#39;t want.

No flame or spam, or you will be infracted.</description>

<p>There is 4 years of help threads, it won’t matter if you word it right, you will find topics with no answers, or topics just suggesting it.</p>
<p>Don’t look at this perspective from your point of view, look at it from an RSPS beginner.</p>
