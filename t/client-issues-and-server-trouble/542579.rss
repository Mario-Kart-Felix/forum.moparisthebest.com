    <title>Client issues and server trouble</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-issues-and-server-trouble/542579</link>
    <description>Howdy MoparScape, I&#39;m having a few troubles on both ends of the bridge so I figure I&#39;ll whip them all up here in one go.

First, I&#39;m using the FreedomX 718 source with a 742 Cache and all is going... pretty well. I&#39;m attempting to change the background using Steve&#39;s Sprite Editor and the Runescape Background utility. The problem being once I replace the images and repack the cache something horrible happens and my Java Console throws me a terrible error. I replace the cache, and everything is good until I try again.

Second, when attempting to make a JAR File so I can distribute a client to greater expand testing purposes but when creating the Jar file using the Client Class files, I double click the client an absolutely nothing happened. Strange, can&#39;t find out what&#39;s causing the problem.

Third and foremost my highscores are acting up. I&#39;m using a Tutorial and files from a thread I found on Rune-Server and after some trial and error, got them installed. 

hiscores.java created: Check
Code Strings added to ButtonHandler and Player.java: Check
Successfully Connected to database: Check
Player stats saved to database: Supposedly check
User Information placed in the hs_users table: Not at all check.

I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s not saving the information into the table, only that it&#39;s not getting to the table.

I know that server trouble is supposed to go into a separate thread but figured I would kill three birds with one stone.

Tips, help and suggestions are greatly appreciated!
