    <description>hey guys well i think ive added basicly everything to the pking in my server, but i need like.... 5 testers to pk on it and give me PERSONAL feedback of what really needs to be done... if im correct ive covered about everything? So i need some testers.... BUT so i dont overload on people i am going to host it on hamachi :o.... All beta testers will recieve SUPERBANKS and &#39;Combat&#39; skills of their choice. (PKING on my server has been commented the same as runescape almost):p

NOTE: This is being put in the &#39;Help&#39; section not as advertising but as i have ran out of ideas. therefore need thoughruly personal ideas of people whom have played the server. I am not advertising anyway i do not plan to host it properly for a loooong time seeing as i have only worked on PKing.

P.S. &#39;SUPERBANKS&#39; &lt;---- Says it ALL lol took me awhile to make :p.

Hamachi Info:

<p>Sorry all for the long quote.</p>
<p>Also, first of all good server, but hamachi is never trusted or used lately,</p>
<p>you may also advertise at the moparscape status page instead of here, this is the wrong board to post.</p>
