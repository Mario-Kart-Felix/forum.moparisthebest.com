    <description>:d Please read these theorys/ideas:d 

Ok i was wondering how to make a 2 host server like say i host the server and my friend hosts the server under 1 ip like no-ip or something like that and everyone can still interact with eachother and everyone can see eachother so when they connect they randomly go to my server or the other server to save bandwidth and too stop lagg sort of like a peer to peer hosting system, do u have any ideas on that it must be possible, but how would i approach that theory i need your help or someones, but i also doubt this because if this could be done why hasnt jagex done it assigning them to the right server via there ip. 1 because it would be too crowded 2 it wouldnt be as good but that is nearly all i can come to terms with. 

idea 2

uploading server files to a ftp network or server etc somewhere and have the client connecting the user and hav the user downloading the data etc from their and storing it. their would need to be some things done to the client etc this must be able to do i think i heard boomer talking about using this method with something.
