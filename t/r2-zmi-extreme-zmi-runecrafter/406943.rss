[B][U]Description:[/U][/B]
The fastest Runecrafting XP in the west!  ZMI-Extreme will power level your Runecrafting level using the fastest method currently in Runescape.  The XP/Hour from using this is heavily dependent on your Runecrafting level, the higher you are the more chance you&#39;ll craft higher-level runes.  For every rune that is crafted here, you get [b]double[/b] the XP.  The only draw back is the runes you receive are random and you can only use [B]pure essence[/B] here.  With this you can get anywhere from 22k-35k XP/Hour.


[B][U]Features:[/U][/B]
*Power-Runecrafts at te ZMI alter
*Choice of run-to-bank or Teleport-to-bank
*Eating food if low on health (Food is user-defined)
*Optional prayer-usage and alter-praying (Must be using teleport-method) (Automatically detects if using regular or curse prayers)
*Choose which type of rune to pay to banker (Costs 20 per bank usage)
*[B]Very[/B] fast
*Solid break system (By Echo_) with cool graphics!
*World switching option (World 70 recommended with this disabled)
*SRL Stats
*On-Screen progress report
*[B]Massive[/B] amount of failsafes to ensure endurance 

[B][U]AntiBans:[/U][/B]
*Human&#39;ish waiting periods
*Human&#39;ish rapid banking
*Camera rotating and angle adjusting

[B][U]Speed increases:[/U][/B]
*Rapid depositing and rapid withdrawing/pouch-filling
*Instant checks for: Area locations, banking, walking, Obj/NPC tiles
*Fast Prayer-handling
*Double pouch emptying

[B][U]How to use:[/U][/B] 
*Start at the bank, the alter, or above ground near the ladder
*If using teleport method or pouches you must have the suggested runes and be using Lunars magic
*If using pouches, have them already in your inventory
*[U]You MUST have the absolute newest Reflection 2[/U], get it [URL=http://&quot;https://github.com/Drags111/Reflection_Dev/archives/master&quot;]here[/URL].

[B][U]Setup (Red is required, yellow is suggested):[/U][/B]

*ggzz (I think) who gave me the idea for a ZMI-Crafter.
*Echo_ as always for his air-tight breaking system.

[End Note]:

This... was no easy script.  I had it working successfully within a matter of hours from scratch, but when I got to the stage of increasing speed, making custom functions and absolute failsafes, then things became real complicated real fast.  For a while I had the option to drop &quot;junk runes&quot; while running from the teleport to the ladder to increase speed some, but this was giving me real problems so I decided the gain wasn&#39;t worth the effort.  In the end it took [U]2[/U] solid days to make this script exactly how I wanted it.  This is by far my biggest script yet coming to just over 1,500 lines of code.

I&#39;ve gone through some very precise testing and debugging and ironed out anything that could potentially break the script.  But being [I]only human[/I] there&#39;s a good chance I&#39;ve over-looked something so [B]please[/B] report major bugs to me on the [u]Villavu forums[/u], and I&#39;ll try my best to patch them up!
