    <title>[READ NOW] The explanation to gravedigging</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/read-now-the-explanation-to-gravedigging/288465</link>
    <description>Five months and 4 days ago, the [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,351880.0.html]new gravedigging policy[/url] was established. Due to my lack of explanation, almost every single one of you has failed to understand what gravedigging is. I am now going to explain to you the rights and wrongs of gravedigging:

You guys are all thinking along the lines that [i]gravedigging is bad[/i] and [i]gravediggers need to be removed from this site[/i]. Sadly, anyone who thinks is is very misguided and needs a correction. &#39;Gravedigging&#39; is a horrible term and really shouldn&#39;t be used at all. Very rarely does a member purposely look for an old topic to bump. Such members are quickly caught and dealt with.

You may see some topics where someone replies on a topic that hasn&#39;t been touched in 6 months. If they had a purposeful reply, why should they receive an infraction? Moreover, they should be praised for using the search feature instead of packing the Server Help section with more duplicated threads. You all need help with things that people have needed help with for the last two years. And if you do not believe me, please take a look at the following 5 threads:

[b]New: [/b]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,371702.msg2808202.html#msg2808202

Make sure you especially look at the dates. People needed help 2 years ago and people need help today. If someone needs help today on something someone solved 2 years ago, then let them reply to a topic 2 years old for further inquiry. I see no wrongdoing or rule breaking there.

[b]On a side note[/b], to help people 2 years down the line from now, please post any solutions to your problems once you solve them. This will reduce the amount of new help topics we get in the future.

If you sincerely read this and are planning to look at &#39;gravediggers&#39; from a new angle, then thank you from the MoparScape Staff.</description>

              <p>As an additional statement, those who post meaningless replies on a topic, whether it be two days, or two years old, would receive an infraction for their lack of respect to follow the rules (in this case, spam), as they normally would.</p>
<p>We do realize as a staff team we have punished some of you for “gravedigging” in the past, but this is a newly revised agreement.  This agreement is into affect on the posting date of <span class="bbcode-b">July 12th, 2009, 10:47PM</span>.</p>
