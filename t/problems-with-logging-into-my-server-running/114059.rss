    <title>Problems with logging into my server/running</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problems-with-logging-into-my-server-running/114059</link>
    <description>Well, I kinda have 2 problems, and i&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;re related.

1) When I compile my server, I get no errors. When I run my server, I get this error-

2) Alright, Well, I ignored this error and I tried to log into my server on Moparscape. It logs me in alright, but before anything at all can load (Just the interface loads, you know, the chat box, the inventory box, the map circle..) it logs me back out. Please help..a friend and I have done alot of work on this server and we dont want to restart it. 

Before you try to give me any suggestions, i&#39;ve already done the following:
Reinstalled JDK 6u1
Replaced edited copy of npchandler with the original one

...So what do I do? PLEASE HELP!!</description>
