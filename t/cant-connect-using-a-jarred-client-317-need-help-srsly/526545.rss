    <title>Can&#39;t connect using a jarred client. 317 NEED HELP SRSLY!</title>

    <description>[b]Edit:
Hoster - Okay i know what the problem is now but i dont know why, i swore to myself that this wasnt the problem but.
on the run server.bat cmd prmpt i ran the client using the run.bat and it showed MY IP.(good)
then i used the jarred client and it connected as 127.0.0.1(bad) WTF!! how do i fix this?  :|
I dont know why its doing this... it doesnt do it on the run.bat file.....  why would it do that as a .jar???
[/b]

Okay I seriously need help with this.
So we have been trying this for a while and haven&#39;t got very far.

The problem is exactly this.
We have a 317 delta project. When we jar the client and sign the jar file, everything with the client is fine, the jar works and opens the client and connects to the server. But when we zip it up and upload it to lets say mediafire for an example, when we upload it to mediafire or uppit and then get someone else to download it and test it.
The jar file still works and opens the client for them, but says error connecting to server.
Its a weird problem.
and its almost as if it just CANT connect at all.. as if it almost says &quot;error connecting to server&quot; before it should.

[b]Putting it simple:[/b]
The jarred client works on the hosters computer and no where else. it still opens just wont connect to the server anywhere else other than on that computer. and yes we signed it.
//

And we have followed many tutorials checked over how we were jarring it a bunch and it still does the same thing.

Also it doesnt download the cache from a download link(its not being made into a webclient), the jar file is in the normal client folder with the cache and sprite folders and the class files.

I also noticed that screen usually doesnt come up like on most jarred clients asking for permissions or what not.
the java screen that comes up whenever you go to a new webclient. You know what I mean.

Any Ideas????? NEED HELP!</description>

Check client.java both sides and just search 127.0</p>
