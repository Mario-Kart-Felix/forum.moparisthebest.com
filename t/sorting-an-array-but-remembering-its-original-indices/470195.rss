    <title>Sorting an array but remembering its original indices</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sorting-an-array-but-remembering-its-original-indices/470195</link>
    <description>ok so you have an array of numbers of various sizes. now you want to sort this array. now you want to display which 5 indices held the largest numbers. after you sort the array the original indices are lost so there for the top 5 will either be 0,1,2,3,4 or the last five indices depending on the way you sorted by ascending or descending.

I am using javascript b/c I want it in the browser. I was thinking JSON could solve my problem but everytime I think of something it ends up having another problem. I feel as if javascript had linkedlists like java I could sort the map by data values and then return the name of the largest keys.

What made me run into this problem was I wanted to iterate a given amount of times and each iteration; generate a random number and round that number to the nearest int; keeping track of the most commonly generated integers and displaying the top 5 at the end of the iterations.

Edit:

NVM I figured it out. I knew it wasn&#39;t hard and I didn&#39;t have to make something complicated.

I made a 2D array. on the 2nd Dimension I had the first number the number and the second the number of times it was generated. Then at the sorting sorted by the number of occurrences. split the array 5 from the end and then sorted them into ascending order. everything works now. Glad I got that figured out.</description>

              <p>Also you can copy the indices to other array and then sort it my 2D array comparison. This will do the job, though may be the complexity will increase.</p>
