    <title>[RESOLVED - DENIED]Revision-organised private server section</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/resolved-denied-revision-organised-private-server-section/548367</link>
    <description>I know most people hate a shit load of different subforums. But private servers seem to be like 7 years behind. I don&#39;t see it happening but just want to discuss this:

What about a different subforum for every major revision? That way development, tutorials and downloads won&#39;t be such a clusterfudge. Much more organisation might (who knows) motivate/create incentive to fill in the gaps. It&#39;s hard to see what&#39;s available because search features on forums are crap and Google only shows so much unless you have leet keyword skills.

[i]Pro coder: ohh, the 474 section is empty. I&#39;m gonna fill it.[/i]

Something like:


[ul]RuneScape 2 Development
[list]Server and Client Development Showoff
[list]RSC
194
289
317
377
459
474
489
508
562
614
637
718
...
[/list]

[list]Server and Client Development Showoff
[list]RSC

...[/list][/list]

At least then when you are looking for something you can find it. There are so many deobs being released nowadays but so little information (or so much in one place it&#39;s hard to notice it) that it just is impossible to see what is lacking, and difficult to find specific bases amongst the ocean of PI and Matrix.

It would enhance the experience of private server development and potentially create activity if players knew there were voids to fill. Just an idea, I have no idea if this is a good one or not but it would be something I would do if I had a popular forum.

Lastly, I understand the rswiki is there, but no one uses it because it&#39;s too obsolete. People only really look at the boards. Which is a shame because I went looking for information on the wiki and it wasn&#39;t there. Fuse the wiki to the boards because it&#39;s what everyone sees.[/list][/list][/ul]


Even source specific boards:

*PI
*Hyperion
*Apollo
*Matrix
*Dementhium
*Dodian
*Allstar
*Miscellaneous

I can never find anything I am looking for.</description>

Bit of an exaggeration. I can probably count the RSC developers capable of writing good code on one hand. Then there’s another group who can write working code that I wouldn’t call good, but it works. This crowd is the ‘tweak and hope for the best’ group.</p>
<p>The RS2 scene has generally been informed by the work of winterlove, cheezscape, and later Graham and company (Hyperion, apollo, etc). There’s probably a bunch of others (back when I joined the big server bases were Cheezscape, Testscape and Project 16) who I can’t recall the names of.<br>
I don’t really see how or when RSC people have ever made their mark on the RS2 development community. However Reines’ work has underpinned much of the RSC community’s development in the last few years.</p>
<p>EDIT: Oh, and by the way, the original idea isn’t so bad. But I prefer the categorisation based on look and feel (i.e., pre-hd, hd, post-hd/current) rather than version numbers. This keeps a reasonable limit on the number of sections while allowing users to have reasonable expectations of what is posted in those sections (if you tell someone pre-hd then they should know that the client look/feel will be somewhere between RSC and the full screen release of the game).</p>

              <p>[quote=“Lin, post:4, topic:548367”]I think it should kind of be like a prawns website where you can have multiple categories. For example, maybe you’re sinisoul for the day (&lt;3) and decide to watch something gay (317-377), but want to throw some incest in there (Client-related), so you combine that category. Finally you’re looking for downloads, so you add big dicks, and now you’re browsing for 317-377 client downloads. This way, you can view any group of things while preventing the forum from looking dead and bloated.</p>
<p>Also, shots fired. Sorry sinisoul, I had to because you’re the only member off the top of my head who hates me for some reason. Inb4 brony comment, even though I’m not a brony. :P[/quote]<br>

<p>Too many different sections, if this DOES happen id say combining similar revisions would be best</p>

I think the best thing would be to separate it all into 3 sections (RSC, RS2, and RS3). But I would personally like if we organized it by graphics type.</p>
<p>So, RSC, RS2(Pre-HD), RS2(HD), and RS3.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>This is a good compromise. But as David said, what happens with 317 loading 602? Does that go in pre-HD or HD?[/quote]<br>
No, david was pointing out a problem with making revision based forums/subforums.<br>
Some members will think their <span class="bbcode-u">317</span> client that has 508 maps, 508 objects, 602 npcs, 602 items, and 602 players belongs in the 508+ section. When in reality, it belongs in the 317 section. Just because you modified parts of it, doesn’t mean the client suddenly changed protocol.<br>
There’s really no debate. If you started with a 317 client and just packed different data into the cache, it’s still a 317 client and goes in 317.</p>

<p>What if the RSC community don’t want that? I wouldn’t want old school Rs2 pushed into the HD 2011 section. Shouldn’t it be want the members of the community want (I don’t know what they want btw)?</p>

<p>RSC has some crazy talented people who influenced everything the rs2 section has. So watch yo mouth. I also think it would boost activity as some of the intermediate developers would be pushed to push their talents. Look at our show off thread down there, give me a link to yours? I cbf to search</p>
