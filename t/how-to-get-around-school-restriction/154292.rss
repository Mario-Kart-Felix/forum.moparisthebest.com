    <title>How to get around school restriction</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-get-around-school-restriction/154292</link>
    <description>ok, i was messing with one of the school computers today, trying to remove the restrictions.. only the computers in our Exploring Industrial Education Class have these restrictions, called Desktop Plus. In addition all the computers in the school have novell. Desktop Plus blocks almost everything, and modifies the entire windows UI so only certain programs are accessable.. in this computers case, its MS paint, Adobe Photoshop, and Corel Draw. Well i was looking for xploits and things, and if you try and launch task manager, it launches, but won&#39;t show because of Desktop Plus. Well so i started looking for online help things, and Corel Draw has a button called  Technical Support under the file menu Help. If you click this button, internet explorer, or your default browser opens the corel draw help site, where you can visit any site, now having IE up, or you can open folders, such as C:\Windows\System32. Once you are in these folders, you usually can run cmd, or other programs. I was messing around and i noticed that i could use tasklist and i found the Desktop Plus task, and killed it. OK, Desktop Plus is gone, so i can do anything now right? yes, well no, not on these computers, since Desktop Plus is a UI mod, you have to launch explorer.exe. Now, on you have successfully unlocked these computers</description>

              <p>so how do you launch the task manager if you can’t do it because of restrictions in effect on this computer? please contact your local admin for help?</p>
<p>or how do you change the start menu properties w/o being able to open the properties? or change the theme because you can’t run and control panel items? (*.cpl) or osave to the windows directory?</p>
<p>i can only run bat files and access cmd and i can access the c:\ drive but i can’t write to the windir or rename/move/delete/anything… its sucks… i can even access regedit but i can’t write to some keys…</p>
