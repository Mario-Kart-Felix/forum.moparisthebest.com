    <title>Web Store - Website development</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/web-store-website-development/536220</link>
    <description>Website: http://xite.io/
[The website is not actually selling products so please do not purchase anything]

The site was made from scratch using [url=http://getbootstrap.com/]Twitter Bootstrap 3.0.2[/url]. The whole idea was to make a web store where I could sell game cards, gift cards etc.

There is no MySQL or databases used right now, the shopping cart is done with [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)]Ajax[/url]. I&#39;m currently planning on processing orders by emailing to the buyer. 

I was planning on using Ruby on Rails originally but it just seemed &quot;cheaper&quot; not tooo! :rolleyes:

[b][u]Features[/u][/b]
- Fully working shopping cart
- PayPal integration (non using IPN right now, but it does support it)
- Each product has their own ID
- Most pages have been made, just a few more left e.g. product information

[u][b]TODO[/b][/u]
[s]- Make the contact us page work[/s] [Completed]
- Account creation system with user CP
- Mobile compatibility (does not currently support mobiles at all)
- Alternative payment methods
- Search Bar

More to come...

<p>I use Foundation a lot actually, or used to when I was still working on stuff. It’s a really, really great framework. Surpasses all others in my opinion.</p>

<p>I have used Foundation 4, and making a responsive site is just as easy as in bootstrap. What a lot of people don’t understand is that you need to design for it from the start. (Or in OP’s case: They don’t understand how media queries work)</p>

I like Foundation better than Bootstrap. Too bad I’m not that great when it comes to actually creating the website. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

You wrap the navbar, sidebar, and content in a div with min-height: 100%, height: auto, and margin-bottom: -{footer height}. In the footer you set the height there. Same as any sticky footer.</p>
<p>As for the sidebar you will have to append the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#responsive-utilities-classes" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">hidden-xs</a> class to the columns to hide it on mobiles.<br>
[/quote]<br>
The side bar is like the most important aspect because it’s the only way people can actually browse through the different products. Hiding it would leave the site unusable because people won’t be able to browse through 90% of the site.[/quote]<br>
Which is why you use the collapse button in the menu on phones… Have you tried to shrink the bootstrap example?! It shows you exactly how you could do it.</p>

The side bar is like the most important aspect because it’s the only way people can actually browse through the different products. Hiding it would leave the site unusable because people won’t be able to browse through 90% of the site.</p>

Okay, just tried using it, that was not a sticky footer. The side bar still has has the same problem. Everything will overlap and mess up.</p>

Thanks for the tip, I know how I should be designing a website (right now I was just smacking together the first thing that came to mind without any though). The final site design would be at the very end once I know that everything does work. The only thing I can’t do is get something unique because of the way I was taught to make sites. (the current minimalistic design is what I am sticking with for now).</p>

              <p>I completely understand using a simple design and I understand that functionality was the main focus which isn’t a bad thing but if you’re a designer then let your creative juices flow. You can still work with the BS3 grid and all the attributes from BS3 but there’s so much more creativity could come from your part, when I was hanging around on the the design scene I’d always keep a notepad and pen beside me when surfing the web, if I used some kind of site and didn’t like the way it looked I’d write that down, if I found something I liked I’d write that down and when it came to actually sticking some code down it came a lot easier. Mock up what you’d like to see from the design side of things in the notepad and just whip it up. You could have 20+ templates sketched out on paper and when an order comes in just pick the one that would fit the best to this job and work around it. The faster and more accurate the design the happier the customer, if the customer is happy that’s a good review and you can’t have enough good reviews. 1 bad review outweighs 40 good reviews on your work in my opinion so if you’re going to be taking website design and development further in your life I’d strongly suggest using a method similar to that.</p>
<p>Give it a try and see how you get on, it’ll bring on your design skills. I’m guessing this was part of your reasoning for using BS3 barebones templates, there’s not many designers who’d use it for functionality to be honest. Most of them would rather have it all their design rather than using features provided by the framework, other than something like a grid system. Which in my opinion yahoos grid system is better, you should check it out.</p>

<p>Heroku is great for low traffic prototypes if you wanted the rails or django support. And considering bootstrap 3 was rewritten to be mobile first it surprises me you don’t have any support for it at all.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The reason I don’t have mobile support is because I’m using [size=8pt]<span class="bbcode-i">position:fixed;</span>[/size] for elements like the side bar, footer. The example on bootstraps website was also not mobile compatible (re size issues due to the fixed element).</p>
<p>I was planning on making a new design for mobile devices because currently nothing would function properly if I just let it all re-size for mobiles.</p>
<p>Heroku is still pricey, I already have a years worth of web hosting so I’m not really going to switch now.</p>
<p>[quote=“Ruby, post:7, topic:536220”]I’m not meaning to sound like a complete arse or whatever but if you’re primarily here for website design then why did you do some simple customisation of a barebones template? If you’re here as a designer then you really should be focusing on learning and then using a lot more than just the bog standard bootstrap framework with no real additional extras.</p>
<p>If I’m not wrong in saying this is <a href="http://conceptlogic.com/jcart/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">jCart</a>? I’m not sure how much you’ve changed of this but it’s pretty poor inside of that, if this was you then you need to understand that you can echo blocks of HTML rather than every line having it’s own echo statement. You also shouldn’t be mixing internal and external styling which I’ve seen a few cases of inside there, also, why did you bother with the tab function? I don’t really see it necessary, alongside the use of the new line at the end of every line of HTML.</p>
<p>Just a few pointers to work towards. I’ve been out of the website development game for almost a year now so justaguy may be able to pick up on what I haven’t. Also BS3 was written to be fully responsive and focused on smaller resolutioned devices such as mobiles then I’m not sure why you don’t have support for them.</p>
<p>Edit, Justin beat me to the last sentence lol.[/quote]<br>
The idea was for it to be an ‘idiot proof site’ hence the simple design. I used jCart for displaying the products in the table, I’m not a developer.<br>
The idea was to create a simple functioning web store.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Functionality </span>was where I was heading towards.<br>
I mean if you guys want to contribute code for the back end by all means do so. There are no flaws with system (that I am aware of) so for the most part it’s all good.</p>

I do not mind heavy handed criticism (gotta get your point across some how) and I’ll totally understand.</p>
