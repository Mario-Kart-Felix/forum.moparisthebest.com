    <title>Help with a client for allstar</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-a-client-for-allstar/378794</link>
    <description>Okay, i havnt been on moparscape, in well....a very long time. Basically, ive been &quot;trying&quot; to code servers on and off, starting from blanks. I always end up running into problems, so i got sick of it, And rather just be called a leecher. So now im just taking all stars source, and changing it up a BIT, not a whole lot. Just enough to feel i have a right to call it partially mine. 

ANYWAY, there lies a problem..... I need a client that runs with all star&#39;s source. Ive been spending the last past 2 days looking up and down the server downloads section, and making constant use of the search bar. All i require is a client that Runs with allstar, So with that said, Can someone give me some clues of where i could get one? Im not saying to post a link, im just saying if u know a source that had a client link, and u think it would work, to give me the name of it, and ill find it myself. 

(not sure if what i just put up is aginst the rules :O) Thanks for reading</description>
