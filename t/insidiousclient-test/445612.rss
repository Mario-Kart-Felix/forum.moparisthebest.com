    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/insidiousclient-test/445612</link>
    <description>Hey guys, First off i&#39;d like to apologize for my false post before, this is the real deal now haha!
Well more importantly i need to post the credits for the people that have let us use their source and that would be
RUNE-PK, PVP 317, Mopar.
(original credits from the source post)..

The server includes many different things, although saying that it is not 100% Picture perfect, i have added NPC&#39;s etc for Pkerz.
But this is my first ever rs private server, and i NEEDED to post it in Mopar first because i couldn&#39;t have done it without you guys.
i thought this was rsc so i posted a thread there to, delete that as well please :)
http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,548428.0.html--DELETE :)


NEW FEATURES; HOME (AT HOME THERE ARE MORE NPC&#39;S FOR ALL YOU NEED + TELE TO BOSSES!) ,EDGE, 
DUEL ARENA 100%, AND NEW CLIENT, NEW PK SHOP, YOUR PKING NEEDS.
HAS SOME COOL BOSSES INCLUDING THE KING BLACK DRAGON
Apart from these features, its a pretty basic delta server. which is also what makes it itself. It guarentee&#39;s old school players a chance to get back into the game, if you dont like the newer versions then this is definately the client for you!
the first few members that can get onto the server and stay active will be the ones to enjoy the client the most! GUARENTEED!

Okay to get started with the client:
this is a TEST, im not 100% sure that the client will run on your PC, i may have to go over the port steps etc, so please tell me if it works it would REALLY help me out, and i need people to help out; im a noob....

Okay pictures:

when this server is up and running at max capability Donator&#39;s will get more things, they already have their own area! :)
Im creating a forum as soon as the client is up and 100% active.

<p>Good job, keep updates coming.</p>
<p>I would, but I don’t generally play rsps or beta test for them, it’s not really my area of expertise.</p>

<p>Well as it is an advertisement of sorts I believe it isn’t against the rules, but you should add a feature list telling us what’s in your server and why we should join.</p>
