    <description>Yeah, I&#39;ll probably get flamed for this...but still...

Everyone come on my new forums!

I&#39;m trying to get them more popular, right now we have 73 posts total and 66 members =\

I check these forums like every single minute and will do my best to do whatever suits you.

Link: [url=http://www.forumspring.com/rs2ps/index.php?]The forums[/url]

There is a website, but it&#39;s awful...if someone can help me with that add me on msn...I&#39;ll pay...

Also, I&#39;m looking for moderators for the forum. I look for active people mostly. Since we have like 2 people with over 5 posts right now...

Any more reasons? Do you need more? Just click the link and post...not that hard...If this post dies, the link is also in my sig. I&#39;ll stop talking now.</description>
