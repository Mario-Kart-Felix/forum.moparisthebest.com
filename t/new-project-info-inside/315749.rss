    <description>Alright i want to start a new project to make a good runescape private server.


i want to have ALL working minigames. i want to make the experience for the player to be fun and make them want to come back. i want the leveling to be a challenge but not too hard still easy and fun to rank up. im looking to create a good economy. i want this server to be about both PvPers and Skillers that way everyone can be happy.
