    <description>Well, I&#39;ve been working on a souce for around 3 days now, and I added some items and I was going to let a friend login to check it out, but it wouldn&#39;t let him!
In my Server Client.java files, it is my server ip, but it still wouldn&#39;t let him.
I have utorret, and Status.Blackout both said my server was on.

My Source is delta.
My Client is Bluur.

Does it matter?
Please help.


On other help, does anyone have 317 fitted morrigan special effects(axe&#39;s), Dragon Bolts (e), and Onyx Bolts (e). Would apreciate a tutorial on how to add ( New to coding ) How to add SoulSplit and Turmoil to a 317, without lag, ( won&#39;t let me for some reason, like adding) help apreciated!!
