    <description>I just started playing again today, and I wanted to know a good skill to train to make money, but also fairly inexpensive to work up. I had started fishing swordies when I started playing again a few months ago. I kind of want to do that, but I&#39;m not sure if fishing will yield the most profit in the least amount of time.</description>

Start trapping Chinchompas. You need 50-70k chins to get 99, and here are the prices. (You keep there stackable bodies.)<br>
Chin price is the G.E.:<br>
667gp.</p>
<p>667x60,000 = 40,020,000 GP.[/quote]</p>
<p>I got 99 hunter on my old account back when hunter wasn’t exactly popular, before the implings were released. I did them from 80-99 and I had to catch 44k or so total, 2k per day, I hunted for 2-4 hours a day, and took me about 2-3 weeks. Although I never had to share a spot or go looking for a world as there was usually never anyone hunting.</p>
<p>It’s still good cash I guess, but rather annoying finding and maintaining a spot.</p>

              <p>If you are really really looking into getting back into the game I suggest buying a membership, at least for a month or two.  From here, complete the quest <a href="http://www.runehq.com/guide.php?type=quest&amp;id=00711" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">swan song</a> and fish monkfish.  These are extremely quick for money <span class="bbcode-i">and</span> exp.  These are much better than swordies and I guarantee you will notice a difference once you try.  The hardest part of this is completing the quests in order to do swan song. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
