    <description>[b][i]Introduction[/i][/b]

Hi there.
My name is Empty. Well no, that&#39;s not my real name ofcourse, but it&#39;s my prefered &quot;gamer&quot; name.
Anywayyyy ... I&#39;m 17 years old, and I&#39;ve been playing Runescape and RSps&#39;s since I was very young, mostly together with my older brother. This gave me quite alot of knowledge in the game itself. Ofcourse, like alot of people, playing the game wasn&#39;t enough. I wanted to actually be able to mage my &quot;own game&quot;, so I started to experiment with making my own RSPS. I was way too young at that time so I only was able to get some experience, I had not enough knowledge nor willpower to actually go through with it. But now, many years later I decided to try it again, hoping this time I&#39;m able to learn even more and get a server online, with some help :)

[b]What do I have to offer ?[/b]

- cash to buy a domain and a vps (the budget on how much I want to invest depends on the quality of the server.)
- basic coding skills
- free time to spend on learning and coding
- a positive attitude and the ability to talk to people calmly.
- basic english, dutch and french (my french isn&#39;t that great)
- players

[b]What do I expect from you ?[/b]

- great coding skills :D
- time to spend in the server
- basic english

[b]What do you get from this ?
[/b]
- A chance to showoff your skills :D
- 50% of all the donations


[u]If you are interested or have a question please add me on skype, send me a message on mopar or comment on this thread. Sorry for my bad english, it&#39;s not my native language and I made this on my mobile so there might be typos :)[/u]
