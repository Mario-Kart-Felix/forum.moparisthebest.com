    <description>Hey guys, well over where I&#39;m at it&#39;s 7:01 a.m. and this is terrible.

I have allergies all night everynight untill 5 a.m. My nose leaks sneezes non-stop and completely fucks my system over.

I can&#39;t sleep all night so I stay on the internet all night then around 8 or 9 I crash unless I hit it with coffe all day and try to sleep at night.

Even that wont work sometimes. I sleep from 8 a.m. untill 3 or even 5 p.m. sometimes which is terrible. Even during daylight my allergies are still pretty bad but minor for most of the day. But nighttime is a living hell.

I&#39;ve tried some allergie reliever medicien but it wont work. Do you guys have any idea on how to relieve this shit? I&#39;ve googled and nothing can help me. 

Well thanks anyways.</description>

Keep it clean and free of allergens.  Keep windows closed, and use air conditioning.

Squeeze a lemon in and let it dissolve in the water.  Place your face directly above the bowl so your nostrils face the lemon water, then just wait until you start to feel the freeing effects.</p>

I had similar problems once, because of my hayfever and at the time I was taking citerizine hydrochloride 10mg tablets, which didn’t really help much. So I went o talk ot my doctor about it n she prescribed me some loratadine which has killed off any symptoms I have left now. Might be worth a try?<br>
[/quote]<br>
Thanks but can I buy it in a local pharmacy? Or do I need a prescription?[/quote]<br>
I think its a prescription drug, but keep a lookout at your pharmacy. Or just go to your doctor ?</p>

<p>I had similar problems once, because of my hayfever and at the time I was taking citerizine hydrochloride 10mg tablets, which didn’t really help much. So I went o talk ot my doctor about it n she prescribed me some loratadine which has killed off any symptoms I have left now. Might be worth a try?</p>

</aside>
<p>Thanks but can I buy it in a local pharmacy? Or do I need a prescription?</p>

              <p>Hey guys, well over where I’m at it’s 7:01 a.m. and this is terrible.</p>
<p>I have allergies all night everynight untill 5 a.m. My nose leaks sneezes non-stop and completely fucks my system over.</p>
<p>I can’t sleep all night so I stay on the internet all night then around 8 or 9 I crash unless I hit it with coffe all day and try to sleep at night.</p>
<p>Even that wont work sometimes. I sleep from 8 a.m. untill 3 or even 5 p.m. sometimes which is terrible. Even during daylight my allergies are still pretty bad but minor for most of the day. But nighttime is a living hell.</p>
<p>I’ve tried some allergie reliever medicien but it wont work. Do you guys have any idea on how to relieve this shit? I’ve googled and nothing can help me.</p>
<p>Well thanks anyways.</p>
