<p>Basically they can do anything they want on your PC. Access all of your files, keylog you, use your computer to perform a DoS attack, etc.</p>
<p>I know that AVG detected a DarkComet RAT someone tried to plant in my PC. As said by CoonHunter and Tom_BETA you need to perform a full and thorough virus scan. You should probably not log into anything else until you have done this.</p>

              <p>If they threatened to crash your PC, they’ve probably installed a RAT on your system. I suggest you run a scan immediately (Malwarebytes etc). Also, try and remember what might of infected you. If the RAT is FUD (fully undetectable) you’ll need to take more measures to remove it.</p>
<p>It’s most likely that the virus launches on startup also, check your startup folder for any suspicious files (e.g winlog.exe, system32.exe, svchost.exe are common names). Check common directories like the below.</p>
<p>C:\Windows<br>
C:\Windows\system32<br>
C:\Windows\system<br>
C:\</p>
<p>Those are all common virus installation directories. If you’ve had no luck download a good scanner e.g malwarebytes, norton etc.</p>

<p>Are some good, free examples. Ensure they’ve been updated then boot into safe mode and scan with them, safe mode will disable the virus making it impossible for him to stop you while you’re scanning. If all fails and it is FUD, you can monitor connections from specific processes in order to gain an insight into where it is, and how to remove it.</p>
<p>You can also take a look at your system processes  (ctrl alt del), if you notice anything unusual, go to properties, get the location then end the process and remove it (Only if you’re sure though)</p>
<p>Once you’ve removed it, install a good firewall and do regular system scans, and be careful what you click on! Your virus scanner doesn’t sound very good. One vital thing you have to look out for is the disabling of UAC, this allows the person to perform admin tasks without your consent, if this has been disabled re-enable it now! I’d also suggest you wipe your private data from all browsers so the person can’t grab the data from the browser file. In most cases it’s just</p>
<p>Menu &gt; settings &gt; delete private data</p>
<p>and that’s it. If you’re really struggling either find a white hat forum, or PM me. Or restore your system to a saved restore point (Which is basing on the fact he hasn’t spread the file)</p>
