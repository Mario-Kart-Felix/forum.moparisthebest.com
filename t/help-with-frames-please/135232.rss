    <title>Help with Frames please?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-frames-please/135232</link>
    <description>Ok - For all those who read this, you will be telling yourself how stupid i am. Just letting you know that idc, so you dont need to reply just to let me know that.
---

I am currently working on a server from the 1337pkz source...

What i would like to know is how i could make a players kill count / death count display on their screen...
I already know i have to do something to do with frames.... but what i need to know is how to &quot;make&quot; them, if you can, and basically just about them....
I have already looked through these forums but havent found anything that really explains what they are etc...

Thanks,
Unborn / Ben</description>
