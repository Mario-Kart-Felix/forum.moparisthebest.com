[b]Here&#39;s a list of our plugins that are available to everyone:[/b]

[ul][li][b]Essentials[/b] - Gives you all the common Essential commands such as Setting your home, teleporting back to your home, teleporting to another player, teleporting to spawn and many more![/li]
[li][b]PermissionsEX[/b] - Used to give players and admins their permissions for all plugins.[/li]
[li][b]Factions[/b]- Allows players to group up and create Factions. Using Factions also protects your buildings preventing griefings.[/li]
[li][b]LWC[/b] - Locks your chests and doors preventing players from stealing from you or entering your homes.[/li]
[li][b]Craft Book[/b]:
    Interactive mechanisms like bridges, elevators, and gates.
    Redstone features such as integrated circuits and programmable logic chips.
    Minecart enhancements such as stations and boosters. [/li]
[li][b]Timber[/b] - Easily chop down trees just by cutting down the stem. Cutting down a block of a tree, makes the blocks above it drop down.[/li][/ul]


[b]Plugins we use to prevent and catch griefers and cheaters:[/b]


[ul][li][b]NoCheatPlus[/b] - Prevents players from cheating. Player Mods such as Fly are allowed. [/li]
[li][b]MineBackup[/b] - Backups all the worlds in case of griefings or any crashes that may occur. We always have a backup of our server in case anything happens.[/li]
[li][b]CoreProtect[/b] - Allows Admins to check where and by who blocks were placed or removed. Also allows Admins to roll back everything a specific player did. (e.g. Rollbacking all Griefer&#39;s actions)[/li]
[li][b]WorldGuard[/b] - Allows Admins to protect Regions of the world preventing any and all griefings.[/li][/ul]


[b]At the moment we have 4 Worlds and an Event World:[/b]

[b]Survival World[/b]
Survival World includes its own Nether, Shop Area near Spawn, Public Mine, and Safe Zone. PvP in Survival World is only allowed if both players agree to it. 
[b]PvP World[/b]
PvP World includes multiple PvP Arenas and Mob Arenas where players can fight each other, fight together against Mobs or do Faction Wars. There are multiple Warps in spawn to get to each Arena quickly.
[b]Creative World[/b]
Creative World explains it self. Everyone gets Creative mod and you&#39;re free to build whatever you want.
[b]Adventure World[/b]
These are maps created by players from Minecraft Map Websites and in the future, maps by us which are for players to adventure on doing various tasks trying to beat the map. 
[b]Event World[/b]
This is going to be used when we do Events such as PvP Events, PvE Events, Puzzle Maps, Creativity Events, etc...
