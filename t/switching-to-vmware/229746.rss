    <title>Switching to VMWare</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/switching-to-vmware/229746</link>
    <description>I&#39;m really sick of the shit windows has been giving me. I haven&#39;t been able to get more than 6 months without a total reformat in the last 3 years. Now that visual studio has stopped working, (will require a fresh OS install to fix), I&#39;m really really sick of the shit.

My plan is to move to Linux (probably Debian), and run multiple VMWares with XP installed.

One VM for development, one for other windows only shit, etc. I will save a copy of the VMWare image after setting up windows and all my programs, so as soon as something goes bad within the VM, I can swap in the fresh image and not have to waste a weekend reinstalling.

With a _REAL_ OS running underneath, I will never be stuck when something crashes, etc.

My question is about the performance hit. I currently have 2gb of ram, and an AMD Athlon 64 3500+, which should be enough to run one VM with 1.5gb of virtual ram. Of course multiple cores would be ideal, but I don&#39;t feel like replacing my CPU at the moment. Games are basically out of the question, but there isn&#39;t there still some 3D acceleration within a VM? (so I can do OpenGL development etc)

What do you think? Any obvious flaws?

inb4 obvious flaw: running windows at all.</description>

<p>OK, one it is. I have one more free pc3200 slot, so I will probably purchase a 3rd gig of ram in the near future.<br>
VirtualBox looks pretty nice, I’ll give it a try.</p>
