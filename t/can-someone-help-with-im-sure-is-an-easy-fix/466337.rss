    <title>Can someone help with im sure is an &quot;easy fix&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone-help-with-im-sure-is-an-easy-fix/466337</link>
    <description>Okay so im trying to just get my own RSPS set up but im having some difficulty getting it going. Like for instance i know how to change the ip and set all the JDK1&#39;s to the updated numbers but as far as getting the server+client to run together is hard. It says complete and running server but when i go to run client nothing happens  :o

So if anyone know&#39;s what im doing wrong please share/help with me so i can fix it. 

Side Note: Last possible solution is teamviewer (if you have the time) because id rather learn how to do it myself.

Thanks in advance  :)</description>
