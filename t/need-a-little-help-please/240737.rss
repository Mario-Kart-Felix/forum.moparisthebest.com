    <title>Need A Little Help Please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-little-help-please/240737</link>
    <description>I am trying to wrap my head around all of this. I am a noob to Java but not to programming. I know a few programming concepts buy playing around with C# a couple years ago. Here are my questions:

1. What do I need to start to program and play a RS2 clone but not have anyone else play on it yet?
2. What do you suggest as the best (or safest) programs and/or tools that I need?
3. Other than the Sun Java web site, are there any other good sites to visit for tutorials/ebooks on Java?

Thanks in advance. If this in the wrong place, could a mod either move it or kill it please.</description>

              <p>Thanks for replying Rog3r. I was thinking about using Eclipse as my IDE, I just donâ€™t know how good it is for a noob. Do I need to follow the instructions for starting a private server just to program and check out what I have programmed by playing or can I just download a source?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 02, 2008, 10:30:32 am[/size][hr]Just to clairify: Do I need any thing more than an IDE(or Notepad++) and a source to play and program a RS clone?</p>

              <p>What program?</p>
<p>Just use notepad or any IDE.<br>
Without doing anything, no one can play on it until you portforward it.</p>
<p>I suggest using Notepadd ++ or IntelliJ</p>
<p>If you want to learn more, just search on Google and you should find it.</p>
