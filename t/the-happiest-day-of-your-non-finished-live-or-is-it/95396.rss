              <p>This question is hard for me, because I don’t “have good days” as it where, but in truth I love every day, I spend a lot of the time on my computer listening to my wonderful music that my mum and brother just hear as noise, but I’d say no day is better than others, sure, soaking wet, tired as hell and 3 miles of moor land left back to a hotel doesn’t compare to being on holiday but then what’s so good about a specific day? I believe we should treasure each and every day.</p>
