    <title>VPS Issue - PLEASE help if you can</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vps-issue-please-help-if-you-can/553931</link>
    <description>Hello,

I am using (Trentahost) VPS and i&#39;m having issues.

I have everything in place, i have my no-ip in the client, and the client port is connected to 43594, I made new rules in my firewall accepting both UDP and TCP ports (43594).
My source is being ran from my remote desktop connection through trentahost. i have my other computer with the jarred and signed client and i&#39;m attempting to connect, but i continuously get &quot;Error connecting to server.&quot;

Does anyone have any clue as to why this may be like this?</description>

              <p>Fixed the issue. Was because the IP address was incorrectly set in the client.</p>
