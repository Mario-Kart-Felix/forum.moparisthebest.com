    <title>Technical problems with quiz</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/technical-problems-with-quiz/241521</link>
    <description>I registered, passed the quiz, although the pink message still remained, i figured it was just a glitch, and if i took it and passed it again it would disappear, i tried this several times to no avail, passing it several times, I then proceeded to try and post a topic into the board designed for technical problems of this sort, and i found that it is missing and/or off limits to me.

any help?

Edit: As soon as i posted this topic, the pink message telling me i needed to take the quiz before i post/private message disappeared, sorry for your inconvenience.</description>
