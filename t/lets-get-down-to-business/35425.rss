    <title>Let&#39;s get down to business</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lets-get-down-to-business/35425</link>
    <description>Ok well it appears that the whole rs cheating scene is quiet at the moment so why don&#39;t we get things moving again. These past few days I&#39;ve been working on a new project of mine called rumacs. I hope to eventually develop it into a fully featured rs2 bot.

Rumacs is a native agent library built with the jvmti tool. JVMTI is basically an event driven api that lets you communicate directly with the jvm with events (and JNI). My first attempt to utilize this tool to my advantage in my quest to make a functional bot for rs failed. I quickly found out that a lot of events that the jvm was firing were lagging the client. I was quite upset because the model I was using would of allowed for a great functional bot. I was faced with the dilemma of re-constructing my bot to still allow this superb potential functionality and not cause the client to lag at an unplayable rate.

I was hoping to find a native BCI library that would allow me to make up for some routines that I had cut out due to the lag problem. I eventually found java_crw_demo. It wasn&#39;t what I had hoped (in terms of functionality), but it did the job. This library only gives me 4 options, 2 of interest at the moment in development:

1. Inject hook at the beginning of client methods.
2. Inject hook at the end of client methods.
3. Notify on object allocation events.
4. Notify on object de-allocation events.

All we need is one home made java class for this bot and that&#39;s all. 

[code]
public class Rumacs
{
	private static native void hook_entry_native(Object thr, int cnum, int mnum);
	public static void hook_entry(int cnum, int mnum)
	{
		hook_entry_native(Thread.currentThread(), cnum, mnum);
	}
	
	private static native void hook_exit_native(Object thr, int cnum, int mnum);
	public static void hook_exit(int cnum, int mnum)
	{
		hook_exit_native(Thread.currentThread(), cnum, mnum);
	}
}
[/code]

Let me now get into the technical details. During the jvm initialization, the methods in which classes we are interested in are modified by java_crw_demo. It basically injects [i]hook_entry[/i] and [i]hook_exit[/i] into, respectively, the beginning and the end of the rs methods of that class. My bot has a hook_entry_native and a hook_exit_native function which are called whenever a rs method is entered and exited. In my native function I use the current thread to get stack frame info to find out exactly what rs method was called (since it&#39;s impossible for java_crw_demo to modify only a few selected methods of a class, it must modify all of the methods of one class). Processing goes from there.



Anyone who is still following me at this point should realize that this as potential of a native, functional bot. I am releasing a small demo of rumacs, open source, so you can see for yourself how it works. I included a script so you can run it, all it does at the moment is output whenever you click your mouse.

I&#39;d like to thank pplsuqbawlz for his loader, I&#39;m currently using it for my testing on rumacs. Although the beauty of rumacs is it can be run right off the official runescape client on their website, this will be default behavior once I can get a decent beta out of it.

One last comment before I leave you, if you want to modify rumacs.c and compile it go into src/ and run the following command:
[code]bcc32 -tWD -n../bin rumacs.c[/code]
I can&#39;t be assed to find the equivalent gcc command because.. well.. honestly, I hate gcc. Oh and also don&#39;t forget to add jvmti.h, jni.h and other includes to your bcc config file.

edit: edited rar file, win32.bat seemed to have a bug. removed nix script. Can&#39;t be bothered compiling it for linux at the moment.</description>

<p><em>Raises Hand</em><br>
Even though I can read and code (more or less) in half a dozen of languages, I’d still consider myself a pure C guy. It seems to me that we keep falling back to what we grew up with <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Back OT:<br>
I downloaded the archive and feel tempted to look through it and there’s some ideas I had in mind since long ago and I’d definitively like to try some of them. Unfortunately I can’t afford having too many hobbies, so I’m forced to set priorities.<br>
I don’t know whether or when I ever will be back into this.</p>
<p>Anyway, my interest in bots completely vanished in favour of my new toy, a Sharp Zaurus (a sexy mini PC) which has full linux support, even though the existing distributions require some coding to suit all my special needs <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
I landed here just because I wondered what’s going on bot-wise, so I thought I’ll check this forum again and after enjoying reading some posts of this guy called semaphore I did a search for all his posts. Searches for a few selected people probably directs you to all the interesting topics <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>It’s a fun idea byte. Although a jvmti solution is insanely impressive from a ‘kung-fu’ standpoint, (Meaning it will gain you loads of respect) from what I’ve seen it is still very difficult to obtain context while ‘tooling’ the bytecode from within the jvm. You (in general not you specfically) must find a way to apply some form of context to the plethora of hooks you are likely to encounter.</p>

The callback function gives us tons of arguments to determine exactly which field of interest was modified then it updates its value in the agent.</p>

<p>A simple misunderstanding. I am using the term <span class="bbcode-i">hook</span> in a more abstract way.</p>
<p>I agree with you that a jvmti approach is much cleaner and easier to implement. Also, because it is c-based it pretty much draws a line in the sand and just about everyone in the community will be left scratching their heads. However, I think you misunderstand the complexity involved with finding sense out of every event that you are going to encounter. As a case and point, how do you plan to figure out what classes you intend to hook for callbacks for class load or for field access/mutation events? You have to have a means of figuring out which fields or method calls are of importance to you. Otherwise you will be inundated with thousands of events (assuming you hook all of them) and no method of sifting the wheat from the chaff. One of the first issues I ran into when first trying what you’re doing is finding context. Sure it is fantastic to be notified of every single modification/access of every single field… but where do I draw the correlation to what change means what. This is the part that makes things a bit hairy.</p>
<p>Sure it’s incredibly easy to obtain a hook to get client data using jvmti events. The problem is once you have that hook in your hands you’ll be left with the ‘wtf face’ look thinking ‘ok… now what?’. Even if you hook on the main game loop (I’m assuming you mean the real main game loop code location and not some abstract ‘main game loop’), you are still left wondering 'ok now which of the 150 of these fields on this client is the field I’m looking for.</p>
<p>There is a solution to this problem. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I just wanted to get that out there so that the kiddies have something to think about before they step out onto the field and play with the big boys.</p>

<p>All legitimate runescapers will load the game from the official website. What I wanted when I started looking at my possibilities was a bot that would be able to do just that. All you need in this case is to change the applet runtime parameters to load the jvmti agent and you’re botting off their website. I haven’t had enough time to look into the client to find traps yet but I would imagine this nullifies several of them. As long as Jagex doesn’t start watching the client jvm I have nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>It would be possible to load a bot directly from the jagex website in java with BCEL and the <span class="bbcode-i">-javaagent</span> option for say. I would encourage bot makers to try this alternative. However, personally, I find BCEL much lower level than JVMTI. JVMTI gives you the interface, in BCEL you must create it by toying directly with the bytecodes. Plus I’m a C guy <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I’m not worried about my hooks, because the method the bot uses to get client data isn’t through hooks but through jvmti events. I only need one hook and I decided to put it on the main game loop (on entry and exit) so my native function can be called. Other hooks can easily be added in, but I don’t see why I would need them.</p>
<p>If anyone is interested I found a neat article on <span class="bbcode-i">-javaagent</span> and the bytecode instrumentation library included in jdk 1.5 <a href="http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t19309.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t19309.html</a></p>
