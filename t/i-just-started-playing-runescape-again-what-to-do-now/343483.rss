The trick is to use mouse keys so you can clean about 100 herbs a minute or more. Putting them in the vials is slower, but requires fuck all clicking. Basically when I did it, I had two monitors set up so I could watch movies as it finished putting the herbs into vials.[/quote]</p>
<p>Wow im not going to lie. Im considering my onboard graphics pretty powerful atm (ATI Radeon HD 4200). I have runescape running at highdetail full screen (1680x1050) on 20 inch monitor on vga. While I have a full hd movie running at a 21.5 inch monitor on hdmi at (1980x1020)</p>

You could turn water filled vials + ranarr weed into unfinished potions to make good money, provided you have capital to start. Once you get 10m cash, start flipping.

<p>Before I left I was doing herb farming and it was ok profit but ive wasted most of my money on cannonballs to get my range up to 70 quickly.[quote=“Lothy, post:3, topic:343483”]How much money do you have?

<p>Is doing to rannar + water vial more than just selling grimy rannars on the ge? Because im killing things atm that drop alot of herbs and I usually get alot of rannars per trip, which usually accounts for the cost of cannonballs.</p>

              <p>I suggest quitting. Otherwise get your range to 85-90 so you can kill aviansies and make a few hundred k/hr. Then you can do mm for the dragon scimitar.</p>
