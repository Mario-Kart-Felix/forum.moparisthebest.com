Look at the model as it is, whether there’s a symbol there or not, as zyle said, racism only exists because you people make a big deal out of it.</p>
<p>Stay on topic, not another word about the symbol or the topic will be closed, look at the detail, give constructive criticism, and so on, you’ve been warned.</p>

<p>Fucking pussies, stop complaining about a god damn symbol. The only reason racism exists, is because dumbasses like you shamcooly, keep letting it exist by bringing it up time and time again.

</aside>
<p>Well actually i know the creator of this thread Irl, and why did you have to single me out? You make no sense, it exists because I’m pointing it out?No, It exists because people got the idea that the color of their skin makes them superior to others. I stopped bringing it up, I was the one who tried to go back on topic but people kept continuing this. This is the internet, where people are free to post their opinions, some don’t care and some do. You obviously do care since you posted on the topic, correct?  So stop trying to act like an e-thug, and next time, try to have some kind of logic to your post.</p>

well, first of all, you have no idea what your saying. i’ll admit it, i’m avery sensitive when i comes to WII, i’ve done ALOt of research on it, and my grandparents were in the war, first of all the swastik was either to mean 1 of these 2 things: the circle of life. or: a brocken cross. and yes, even though all this started with hitler in germany, it doesnt mean that all nazi’s are german, in almost every country there’s a den of skin-heads somewhere. oh and when you say that my country is a third party country, then your a fucking bitch who has a flacid asshole thinking it’s your dick. my country is where WWII fucking began bitch, in poland, although i don’t live there, i know a shit load of history, i’m only prejudice against the prejudice. anywyas, i bet you live in some low down fucked up country where your parents are hard labour workers who spend all they’re savings on your “precious” internet.</p>

              <p>Lol @ Everyone, I’m 99.9% sure that everyone on this forum isn’t a Nazi, anyone that is German on these forums, I doubt were alive when Hitler killed millions of Jews, maybe their great grandmother, if she’s still alive. But no. No one on these forums were involved in killing millions of jews, so please stop the flame war. You’re acting like a bunch of hippies going like “OMFG OMFGOMFG STOP THE HATE NERD GERMANS LOLOLOLOL”. If you’re going to keep flaming the Germans, then go back to living in your mothers basement, and go back to thinking aliens are real.</p>
<p>My point is made, if someone tries to flame me, or quote me and then say something bad, then you’re a idiot, and you deserve to have your account removed from these forums.</p>
<p>Edit: If you’re going to say I’m German, and I’m trying to support what Hitler did, then you’re a freakin’ idiot. I’m 100% Irish.</p>

I misspoke, I didnt mean so much as ‘make fun of’ but more of ‘lighten the mood’. Lets end this now. no more spam. Those who want to dwell on the past, go for it.

<p>The nazis still exsist today, they just don’t have as much power. And about the model, I think the hilt of the dagger is way too flat, and the actual blade could be a little thicker. Also if you have a logo right above the hilt, there’s no need to put it on the hilt too. Other than that and the nazi symbolism, good job.</p>

<p>You’re being over sensitive.  Yea, its not necessarily appropriate, but its not appropriate to flame him. its not <span class="bbcode-i">his</span> design. he liked the dagger, so he made it. lets not start a flame war. Plus, he made the model, this doesnt mean he believes in what Hitler did. He’s not necessarily being ‘racist’, which is not even a correct term. Judaism is not an ethnic background, its a religion. Therefore, how is it racist? it may be a little prejudice, but that just shows that you’re overly sensitive. Im german, im not offended by this. know why? because this <span class="bbcode-i">doesnt affect me</span>. I dont see anyone in here saying “FUCK YOU GERMANS!!!”, so how can you other german people be offended either? nobody is saying “Fuck the jews”, so the jews should stop being over sensitive. we all know what happened in the past, so why not be like Kenny Hotz and make fun of it?</p>

<p>One, Jews were not the only people targeted during the halocaust. Two, most neo-nazis believe that the white man is superior, and all other races are not. He Created an item with this symbolism on it and releasing it to other people, and that is a way of supporting it. If you didn’t believe in it why would you go through the trouble of making it and posting it? And at your last sentence, why would you make fun of the slaughtering of millions of innocent people, their suffering, and their tears? It’s something immature little kids make fun of, and idiots. It may have happened in the past, but history has the tendency to repeat itself, so lets not make fun of this type of thing, because it can happen again.</p>
