    <title>2 Questions - World Objects and Text on Screen</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2-questions-world-objects-and-text-on-screen/45752</link>
    <description>I would appreciate if someone could PM me or post a list of world objects for testscape because I cannot find one. Also, like on -fedexer-&#39;s screenshot with his global objects tutorial, how would I put text in that area? Thanks so much for the help!
