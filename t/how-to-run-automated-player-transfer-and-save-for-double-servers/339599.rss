    <description>DIFFICULTY:|||||||||| 20% (must know how to run schedualed tasks)
ABOUT: This is for people who run double servers, when a player registers on one server their files automatically save, this will help you with problems on having to control more than one server.

First what you need to do is create a batch file. Open up notepad and add this text into it.
[code]@echo off
copy &quot;c:\directory\server\players&quot; &quot;c:\directory\2nd server\players&quot;[/code]
Replace the name with what you need it to be (if you&#39;re hosting off of two seperate computers get dropbox add one of your server folders into it).

Next, follow these steps...
[Step one] - Go to Start and move your mouse over All Programs.
[Step two] - Enter the Accessories folder and then click System Tools.
[Step three] - Select the Scheduled Tasks file, and double-click Add Scheduled Task.
[step four] - Select Next and then click Browse. Navigate to where you saved the batch file (C:), select it and click OK.
[step five] - Under &quot;Perform this task&quot;, select the schedule you would like, for exampe i will use, When I log on.

So now when i log on i will have replaced ALL of the player&#39;s files. If you need less time than that you can always edit it. I hope this extremely simple tutorial helps and if you want me to add on anything or add pictures i will :)

Credits. 99.9% to me, 00.1% to a friend of mine who showed me where to add a schedualed task (he doesn&#39;t even know what rsps is).</description>
