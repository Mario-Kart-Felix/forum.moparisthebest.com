    <description>Ok.
My Server, UnScape, and its Client, &quot;UnScape Client&quot; (:p), usually work good together, apart from the few out of memory errors which i can fix with a batch file.
I have recently added a new class to my server, &quot;LoadSave&quot; - Which loads a users data out of a MySQL database, and sets the corresponding variables to the &quot;Player&quot;. I spent about 3 days setting up the Database, creating the class to read from it, testing it, etc.. But when it came time to import the new class into my server, and change some stuff around to actually use it, It still worked fine - for my server. My client on the other hand, would get an error on completion of the servers login validation / loading process:
&quot;Exception in thread &quot;Thread-3&quot; java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 9999&quot;. This also occurs when i use a batch file to debug the MoparScape client 3.2.
I have received similar Array index out of bounds errors before, So i know this refers to somewhere in the client attempting to read the 9999th entry of an array. I believe the reason this error occurs has something to do with the changes to my server, as no changes to my client have been made. Here are some changes i made to my server:
• Added the new class LoadSave to my server directory.
• Added a new void to client.java to run the new class and return &quot;returnCode&quot;s:
[CODE]
public int loadLogin() {
	if (PlayerHandler.updateRunning) { //System Update
		returnCode = 8;
		disconnected = true;
		savefile = false;
		return 0;
	} else if (PlayerHandler.getPlayerCount() &gt;= PlayerHandler.MyMaxPlayers) { //Server Full
		returnCode = 7;
		disconnected = true;
		savefile = false;
		return 0;
	} else if (PlayerHandler.isPlayerOn(playerName)) { //Account already online
		returnCode = 5;
		disconnected = true;
		savefile = false;
		return 0;
	} else if ((playerName.indexOf(&quot;Unborn&quot;) &gt; -1 || playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Admin&quot;)) &amp;&amp; !connectedFrom.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;localhost&quot;) &amp;&amp; !connectedFrom.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;)) { //Unauthorized owner login
		returnCode = 10;
		disconnected = true;
		savefile = false;
		return 0;
	} else {
		LoadSave x = new LoadSave();
		x.LoadSave(PlayerHandler.players[playerId], playerName, playerPass);
		if (x.haltCode == 0) {
			returnCode = 2;
			return 1;
		} else if (x.haltCode == 1) {
			returnCode = 3;
			disconnected = true;
			savefile = false;
			return 0;
		} else if (x.haltCode == 2) {
			returnCode = 4;
			disconnected = true;
			savefile = false;
			return 0;
		} else if (x.haltCode == 3) {
			returnCode = 9;
			disconnected = true;
			savefile = false;
			return 0;
		}
		x = null;
	}
	return 0;
}
[/CODE]
• Moved the declaration of some variables from client.java to player.java to allow easier access by my new class. (mutedate, kitstarte, questid, q1stage, q2stage, q3stage ,q4stage, totalqp)
• Modified the way user account information is read.
    • Used to be:
[CODE]
if(readSave() != 3 &amp;&amp; checkbannedusers() != 5 &amp;&amp; checkbannedips() != 5 &amp;&amp; disconnected != true) {
loadmoreinfo();
...
[/CODE]
    • Now:
[CODE]
if(loadLogin() != 0 &amp;&amp; checkbannedusers() != 5 &amp;&amp; checkbannedips() != 5 &amp;&amp; disconnected != true) {
//loadmoreinfo();
...
[/CODE]

Those are the only changes i can remember....

If anyone knows what ive done that i shouldnt have, havent done that i should have, etc.., Please reply.

Thanks,
Ben Corbett / Unborn
