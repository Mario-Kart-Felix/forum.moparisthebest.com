    <title>Best way to handle a &quot;Gotcha&quot; moment with weed w/ my mom?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/best-way-to-handle-a-gotcha-moment-with-weed-w-my-mom/546914</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I don&#39;t want to start a debate about pot, but I smoke it occasionally and there was a small fudge-up tonight, and I honestly just feel like shit. About 5 hours ago I literally just told my RETARDED friend to stop texting me about all weed stuff and revert that shit to snapchat, but him being the dumbass that he is, does it about an hour ago and says some shit about how he&#39;s about to toke. Anyways, it&#39;s safe to say I&#39;m really fudgeing pissed at him and chewed him out, but since my mom and I recently updated to iOS 8 and use the same iTunes account, our iMessages were temporarily synced and she, well.. kinda put the pieces together. I&#39;m 18, I live at my own place, she realizes I&#39;m an adult and played it really cool. It all happened so fast that I had no real time to delete any messages, so I decided to just take it like a truck. Anyways, she had been giving me a ride back to my apartment at the time (I was at the house running some errands and she had given me a ride back.) She was surprisingly cool and just said, &quot;Hey, I don&#39;t mean to be too smothering mother advice, but the whole smoking pot thing... just don&#39;t do heroin or meth or anything.&quot; Something like that. I don&#39;t think she got my messages a little bit before she updated her iPhone in where I was literally buying some weed over text, but it&#39;s honestly irrelevant at this point, and it&#39;s safe to say she knows.

Anyways, call me a pussy since she isn&#39;t really &quot;mad&quot;, but I just feel shitty about it. Keep in mind I have been hiding this from her for quite some time (a year-ish) and I guess it was a matter of time before it happened, but what should I do? Should I awkwardly leave it the next time we talk or should I try and mention something? Either just seems cripplingly awkward to me, and again I feel like an asshole. I&#39;m a good person and I won&#39;t do anything insanely stupid, and she knows that, but still, idk. I just feel like somewhat of a disappointment. What did you guys do when/if your parents caught you doing shit like this? God I&#39;m such a pussy.</description>

Not a lot, but there’s definitely people out there who don’t. You only hear about the ones who don’t care though, not the ones who do.</p>

              <p>I think the key point that changes everything in your situation is that is sounds like you are completely responsible for yourself, and no longer your mom’s burden/gift that she has to care for. I would take her advice about keeping away from other more serious types of drugs, but I don’t believe it needs any further discussion. Also, I don’t believe you were “hiding” anything as long as lied to her about any previous questions she had about it; like I said, it seems like she is no longer responsible for you, so it is really none of her concern.</p>

<p>Sounds like pretty sound advice to me. Most parents as Justin states just worry. Be confident in what you do and just reassure them that you are in control and are using responsibly.</p>

              <p>Hey guys, I don’t want to start a debate about pot, but I smoke it occasionally and there was a small fudge-up tonight, and I honestly just feel like shit. About 5 hours ago I literally just told my RETARDED friend to stop texting me about all weed stuff and revert that shit to snapchat, but him being the dumbass that he is, does it about an hour ago and says some shit about how he’s about to toke. Anyways, it’s safe to say I’m really fudgeing pissed at him and chewed him out, but since my mom and I recently updated to iOS 8 and use the same iTunes account, our iMessages were temporarily synced and she, well… kinda put the pieces together. I’m 18, I live at my own place, she realizes I’m an adult and played it really cool. It all happened so fast that I had no real time to delete any messages, so I decided to just take it like a truck. Anyways, she had been giving me a ride back to my apartment at the time (I was at the house running some errands and she had given me a ride back.) She was surprisingly cool and just said, “Hey, I don’t mean to be too smothering mother advice, but the whole smoking pot thing… just don’t do heroin or meth or anything.” Something like that. I don’t think she got my messages a little bit before she updated her iPhone in where I was literally buying some weed over text, but it’s honestly irrelevant at this point, and it’s safe to say she knows.</p>
<p>Anyways, call me a pussy since she isn’t really “mad”, but I just feel shitty about it. Keep in mind I have been hiding this from her for quite some time (a year-ish) and I guess it was a matter of time before it happened, but what should I do? Should I awkwardly leave it the next time we talk or should I try and mention something? Either just seems cripplingly awkward to me, and again I feel like an asshole. I’m a good person and I won’t do anything insanely stupid, and she knows that, but still, idk. I just feel like somewhat of a disappointment. What did you guys do when/if your parents caught you doing shit like this? God I’m such a pussy.</p>
