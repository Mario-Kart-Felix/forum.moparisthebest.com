    <title>Looking to join in making a server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-to-join-in-making-a-server/452146</link>
    <description>Hey guys, i am looking for someone that has experience in this subject. Someone that can teach me how to do code. You do not have to spill out every piece of knowledge you have to me but teach me the basics. I want to make a server and actually code  it and get it running and get some people on it. If you want to be serious and actually make this a fully grown working and ready to go server by all means. But if you just want to do this for the heck of coding and see what we can make out of it then be my guest. Shoot me a pm or simply comment here. I AM A QUICK LEARNER AND CAN CATCH ONTO THINGS QUICKLY. Thanks guys.</description>

              <p>It’s great that you want to learn, but a good tip is to just download a source and get started on your own! You can never tell if your teacher is even that good on a site like this, so it may be a good idea to teach yourself by looking at tutorials. I suggest learning the basics of Java (if you don’t know them already) and then just making help topics or general programming topics if you need more tutelage while trying to program on your source.</p>
