    <description>Hey guys, I know this isn&#39;t a SCAR Script, but this program is a ScoreSender that was created by Archon.

What it does is it sends the score you want to Neopets. You have to fill in the fields such as: Game ID, Score, and Time (time to wait before submitting score). 

I&#39;ve used this program personally and its great! I recommend to use reasonable scores and not to use this for trophies (cuz you will most likely be banned)

Enjoy!

PS. You can scan it if you like, but its clean :)</description>
