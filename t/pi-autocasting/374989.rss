    <description>The autocasting on my server is very buggy.

I tried to fix it, but it just doesnt seem to change anything.

Im not sure where to look for the problem so i just used Z-Filesearcher and tried to fix whatever looked wrong due to autocasting.

The problem is :

When trying to autocast ice barrage it uses blood barrage.
Blood barrage uses shadow barrage.
Shadow barrage uses smoke barrage
Smoke barrage uses ice blitz

Ect... you get the point...

Im not sure which code to post, does anyone have any ideas?</description>
