    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/when-and-why-did-you-come-to-mopar/148280</link>
    <description>I came on August 22nd, after googling for runescape hack/cheats (because Kait went down and I never bothered to join a new community) and finding moparisthebest, a few hours after the split.</description>

              <p>First cheat site I went to, was rstools.prv.pl, rest in peace. It was Friday’s site. He had links on there to other sites, that’s how I found Sythe and Kaitnieks.</p>
<p>I joined here on my first account on March 19th, 2006 under the name Fuez666. I had been visiting for a pretty long time before though.</p>
<p>I saw Mopar on Kait’s site a lot, and loved the things he did… I still remember what his signature was…</p>
<p>Money<br>
O-I forget<br>
Power<br>
A-I forget<br>
Respect</p>
<p>Then I heard he started a site, and went to it. Back when Mopar was known for something other than Moparscape, but an amazing scar scripter. I still remember staying on until 2 in the morning in the aryan section, trying to write scripts, and then I just stopped playing RuneScape and coming to Mopar all together after Aryan died.</p>
<p>Then, I came back in July of '06 under this name, and started going to the tut, and 3rd party programs. I remember posting torrent sites I found, or making random ass tuts that people laughed their asses off at, yet still found them funny.</p>
<p>Now, I don’t play RuneScape, and Mopar’s site has changed, a lot. To be perfectly honest, if I hadn’t come here back when this place was huge, I wouldn’t have stayed. I stay now because I’m just attached to this community.</p>

<p>At the end I would like to thank mopar (again?) for creating this community and for keeping kaitnieks legacy alive… Or have mopar created a whole new cult/community/legacy? Well maybe some new guy will make a topic for that one (I still remember when I made a topic where I was asking about OSi, what it is and what is it for? :D).</p>

Alot of people i know came here just for aryan updates, including me (yeah i was mostly a leech back then). Unfortunately nobody but the mods can see my real first posts in the aryan sections because they have been hidden.</p>
<p>I found <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> from someone on the fagex irc called vbcoderx whom is now a good friend of mine. I went on irc asking if anyone knew how to update aryan and he linked me to here. I eventually became active after aryan was murdered.</p>
