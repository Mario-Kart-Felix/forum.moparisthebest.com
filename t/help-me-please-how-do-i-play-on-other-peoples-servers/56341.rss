    <description>I am Very New here. I downloaded my mopar. and its very laggy

like most noted items when i put in  bank turn into obby mauls  and i cant drop or pur them in bank. i have to sell to a gen store

all my weapons attack the same way

i cant use range/ mage attacks

and i cant do most stats like thieving and stuff

and my jaw is missing

so i think its better to just join another players game

So how do i join another players server?</description>
