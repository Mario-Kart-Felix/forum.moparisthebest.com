    <title>Did rep acually help this community?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/did-rep-acually-help-this-community/189583</link>
    <description>Some ups and downs of this thing called &quot;rep&quot;

The ups.

1. Have you guys noticed that most of the people that came here for rep, acually learned something.

2. Some people that came here for rep acually weren&#39;t lazy and made their servers by themselves.


The downs.

1. People only came for rep and spammed the forums.

2. People only came for rep just to get respect.

Please post your opinions.

Do not say that this is the wrong section because I know it is.
Do not flame.

Thanks</description>

<p>CMS are ASSHOLES from MITB and that’s why there are no new vets because they all vote no when a new poll goes up and they have more then current vets so they fuck us over. Join the <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> irc once and you’ll see howm uch they hate us</p>

<p>MITB said it was a little harsh and was asking for help on deciding to unban you. I know you would have been unbanned if you waited</p>

<p>same<br>
its fun makeing your own skill from scratch never know how its going to turn out<br>
and when you do get it to work your excited<br>
but you can also go to others for help<br>
then after awhile of learning basic java from p servers you can go do bigger things</p>

God of Ikiliki said everyone that came from there are flamers and leechers :l…He pmed me that anyways when I said my opinion about the site. People who try to leech off that site usually get caught the second they do it. I do like the tuts, it helped me learn alot more than I did when I first started o.O.</p>
<p>Some new players from that site usually go here and leech what was on it to get rep.</p>

<p>i say yes/no on this<br>
rep is a way to see how good you are doing (by reading the comments)<br>
but…if you just read the replys and remember them i guess that works to<br>
so idc</p>
<p>people do come here just to get rep and show off<br>
but some others dont</p>

              <p>Rep = Good for some people, Bad for noobs in the community. I’ve seen about every thread on the tutorial section about 3 times and everyone leechs. I’ve even see a 135 repped user leech delta’s npc dialogues tut for rep.</p>
<p>I’ve been around since I don’t know, May of last year and I always liked to play and not learn. Now I’ve started helping and I think rep makes me want to stay here and help.</p>
<p>Only thing I do hate, is SOME of the people that asked for rep on purpose act like they’re all that, but I doubt they received all their rep fair. I do think that at least half of the community is here for rep and only rep, I know where they are all at too.</p>
