    <title>Selective display of NPCs etc?</title>

    <description>[quote=&quot;pplsuqbawlz, post:26, topic:299955&quot;]Nothing, it&#39;s not like you can use opengl&#39;s model vertex&#39;s to identify models between updates and find their locations on screen to click? It&#39;s not like they encrypt what the video card is doing, AT ALL. Not like they could if they wanted? They could protect it, but that&#39;s an entirely different approach they don&#39;t do, yet. I dunno, try a developer driver for a couple of days, and just have a nice watch... You could make an auto fighter without knowing the littlest bit about jaggl, java, and all that nonsense.[/quote]

This got me interested. Does anyone know what would actually have to be done, to for example make RS only render NPCs for example?</description>

</aside>
<p>You could make an entire bot from graphics library trampolines. Minus the input of course. Identifying models from vertex is actually common practice amongst hackers; on many many games… Aimbots in CS for example… Or even bots in WoW. Think about it, what changes the least in a released game? The original content… How often do you replace the knight piece of a chess board? Never. Aesthetic updates fall to the wayside of content, engine performance, and engine extension. Use that to your advantage.</p>
<p>There’s enough graphics drivers out there, that you can essentially go unbanned while blatantly hijacking calls by appending a stub to the driver. The majority of “detection” that is applied to these methods is minimal, they usually just query the driver for the information… Which you hijack the query with your stub and just check the register, did the query come from the application? Yes? Return setting from array_of_game_settings else call actual driver routine.</p>
<p>It’s just another approach to the same end, like using packet capture drivers such as winpcap to hijack socket’s data, such as popular hacks like redvex’s man-in-the-middle on diablo 2, or roundwurm for wurmonline.</p>
<p>I don’t know how long you’ve been here but you’ll soon realize the majority of this community fit inside a very tiny box they are afraid to venture from. I remember when I explained using interfaces to hijack fields to the ARGA team ages ago. People who find solutions and put it to use become legends. Everyone else, leach.</p>
