    <title>Question about how to Deob Bot client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-about-how-to-deob-bot-client/478998</link>
    <description>Ok so I have a client with no source files. It&#39;s a bot client. I need to change the version of the client because it is updated. I am no good at Deob and I dont think there are any programs to deob a rsc bot client. I would really love to deob the client so I can mess with all the src files but like i said I do not know exactly where to start. I do know to get the class files I open the jar file in winrar and can see everything. I then can put all the class files in a folder but when I edit the class file with the client version I do not know how to even begin to compile that 1 file because i have no build.xml or whatever i need to be able to compile. I have tried to do a online compiler but it wants a server also. If someone can help I can compensate somehow.</description>
