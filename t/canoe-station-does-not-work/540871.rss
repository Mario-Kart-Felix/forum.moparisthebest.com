              <p>You want to look into the <a href="https://rswiki.moparisthebest.com/index.php?title=317:Button_click" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">button click</a> packet - try debugging to get the button ids then assign events to them, in your case cutting the canoe (check player inv for knife and logs). Then spawn the object, only for the player and finally handle the <a href="https://rswiki.moparisthebest.com/index.php?title=317:Object_action_1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">object action 1</a> packet to do the actual transportation.</p>
<p>ps You should definitely add some form of packet verification, so that people don’t teleport to the locations from all over the map, ie check if a canoe was spawned for the given player (set a flag) and their distance to its cached position.</p>
