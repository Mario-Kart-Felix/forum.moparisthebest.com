    <description>Please note i take no credit for this. Found this ages ago. I am posting this to help with your servers.

Methods:

[code]public void newPlayerRegion(int id,Client c){
		try { 
			Queue&lt;Client&gt; g = getClientRegion(id);
			g.add(c);
		} catch(Exception e){
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
	public void updatePlayerRegion(int id, int oId, Client c){
		try {
			Queue&lt;Client&gt; g = getClientRegion(oId);
			g.remove(c);
			g = getClientRegion(id);
			g.add(c);
		} catch(Exception e){
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
	public void removePlayerRegion(int id,Client c){
		try {
			Queue&lt;Client&gt; g = getClientRegion(id);
			g.remove(c);
		} catch(Exception e){
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
[/code]

Then update your player loop as so:

[code]
//for (int i = 0; i &lt; Constants.MAXIMUM_PLAYERS; i++) {
		for(Client c : getClientUpdate(((Client) plr).currentRegion)){
			Player p = (Player) c;
			/*if (players[i] == null)
				continue;
			if (!players[i].isActive || players[i] == plr)
				continue;
			int id = players[i].playerId;
			if ((plr.playerInListBitmap[id &gt;&gt; 3] &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; (id &amp; 7))) != 0)
				continue; // player already in playerList
			if (!plr.withinDistance(players[i]))
				continue; // out of sight

			plr.addNewPlayer(players[i], str, updateBlock);*/
			
			if (p == null)
				continue;
			if (!p.isActive || p == plr)
				continue;
			int id = p.playerId;
			if ((plr.playerInListBitmap[id &gt;&gt; 3] &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; (id &amp; 7))) != 0)
				continue; // player already in playerList
			if (!plr.withinDistance(p))
				continue; // out of sight

			plr.addNewPlayer(p, str, updateBlock);
		}
[/code]

Don&#39;t mess with code you don&#39;t understand. Obviously you&#39;ll have to apply different code for different servers. And let&#39;s not forget that this code is old. Feel free to make your own...</description>

You do realize the all those region methods create a new queue everytime it’s called…This will not work what-so-ever and will create a shit ton of performance issues.<br>

<p>T’isn’t my code, but the benchmark tests showed that it actually performed better than standard wL code without regions[/quote]</p>
<p>prove it</p>

              <p>Please note i take no credit for this. Found this ages ago. I am posting this to help with your servers.</p>
<p>Methods:</p>
<p><code>public void newPlayerRegion(int id,Client c){
		try { 
			Queue&lt;Client&gt; g = getClientRegion(id);
			g.add(c);
		} catch(Exception e){
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
	public void updatePlayerRegion(int id, int oId, Client c){
		try {
			Queue&lt;Client&gt; g = getClientRegion(oId);
			g.remove(c);
			g = getClientRegion(id);
			g.add(c);
		} catch(Exception e){
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
	public void removePlayerRegion(int id,Client c){
		try {
			Queue&lt;Client&gt; g = getClientRegion(id);
			g.remove(c);
		} catch(Exception e){
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
</code></p>
<p>Then update your player loop as so:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">//for (int i = 0; i &lt; Constants.MAXIMUM_PLAYERS; i++) {
		for(Client c : getClientUpdate(((Client) plr).currentRegion)){
			Player p = (Player) c;
			/*if (players[i] == null)
				continue;
			if (!players[i].isActive || players[i] == plr)
				continue;
			int id = players[i].playerId;
			if ((plr.playerInListBitmap[id &gt;&gt; 3] &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; (id &amp; 7))) != 0)
				continue; // player already in playerList
			if (!plr.withinDistance(players[i]))
				continue; // out of sight

			plr.addNewPlayer(players[i], str, updateBlock);*/
			
			if (p == null)
				continue;
			if (!p.isActive || p == plr)
				continue;
			int id = p.playerId;
			if ((plr.playerInListBitmap[id &gt;&gt; 3] &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; (id &amp; 7))) != 0)
				continue; // player already in playerList
			if (!plr.withinDistance(p))
				continue; // out of sight

			plr.addNewPlayer(p, str, updateBlock);
		}</code></pre>
<p>Don’t mess with code you don’t understand. Obviously you’ll have to apply different code for different servers. And let’s not forget that this code is old. Feel free to make your own…</p>
