    <title>Bin Laden dead, USA has body [IMAGES RELEASED NSFW (not osama)]</title>

    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Osama bin Laden, hunted as the mastermind behind the worst-ever terrorist attack on U.S. soil, has been killed, sources told ABC News.

His death brings to an end a tumultuous life that saw bin Laden go from being the carefree son of a Saudi billionaire, to terrorist leader and the most wanted man in the world.

Bin Laden created and funded the al Qaeda terror network, which was responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. The Saudi exile had been a man on the run since the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan overthrew the ruling Taliban regime, which harbored bin Laden.

In a video filmed two months after the Sept. 11 attacks, bin Laden gloated about the attack, saying it had exceeded even his &quot;optimistic&quot; calculations.

&quot;Our terrorism is against America. Our terrorism is a blessed terrorism to prevent the unjust person from committing injustice and to stop American support for Israel, which kills our sons,&quot; he said in the video.

Long before the Sept. 11 attacks, bin Laden was known as an enemy of the United States. He was suspected of playing large roles in the 1998 bombings of two U.S. Embassies in Africa and the attack on the USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden in October 2000.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

              <p>I just picked the first list I saw, I’m sure if you tried to look deeper people of middle east origins will tend to be more chaotic. Again I just picked a random list I saw, but to be honest, most middle easterners I know aren’t that calm at all in their mannerisms which is exactly the image people see when they think of a middle easterner.</p>
<p>Even though now that I think about it, it’s just different cultures. From what I’ve seen, middle easterners tend to be loud and most people don’t appreciate that. That’s only one of the qualities I’ve noticed in middle easterners but they do make us stand out.</p>

              <p>They are fighting in a ‘civilian populated area’, so you can’t help but firing inside one.  This isn’t the 1700s when stupid Europeans lined up against each other in an open field wearing brightly colored uniforms and took turns firing muskets at each other without aiming.  It’s guerilla warfare inside of populated cities filled full of a combination of innocent bystanders and enemy soldiers, all dressed alike.  The best that can be done is to try to only kill the bad guys, and I’m sure every American soldier does just that.</p>
<p>Contrast that with the terrorists, who specifically target innocents, and women and children, because it causes the most terror.  And they are terrorists.  There is obviously nothing in common between the two.</p>
