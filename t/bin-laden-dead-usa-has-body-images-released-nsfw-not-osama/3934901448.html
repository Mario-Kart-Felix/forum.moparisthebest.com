I don’t support all this but your comments are harsh and ignorant.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I beg to differ.  We know about Osama Bin Laden, and if these men died in his service and/or defending him, then we know everything that we need about their lives.  They were about as low as you can go, and surely deserved death, either slow and drawn-out via a trial and execution, or quick via self defense.  Still, no decent, intelligent person cries for them.[/quote]<br>
Wow, the ignorance speaks volumes.<br>
How much do you know about Osama Bin Laden? Have you been to Saudi Arabia to say the least? I know for a fact that all that people in countries outside of the Middle East hear about the people, culture and everything inside these countries know barely about these countries.<br>
You don’t know Osama Bin Laden, you only know that he was the leader of a “terrorist group” and had several differences with Western countries and upheld them through violence since he deemed them the best way to put across his message. The 3 men who were shot dead didn’t defend him. According to “another, revised” statement by the White House, only shot was fired and that was by Osama’s courier. No one else fought or restrained.</p>
<p>You don’t decide how or why someone should die, it’s the judicial process that should choose that. Of course if this were the case with someone from a western country, a compound raided in Washington by a Middle Eastern on South Asian country and killing a terror group leader, things would be much different. Your government would surely make a huge mess out of it but simply due to America’s pressing stronghold on international issues and domestic issues in countries, these countries have no choice.</p>

For all those bitching about America giving orders to kill Osama on sight; it hit me that the majority of you aren’t Americans, therefore you don’t pay American taxes, and therefore your opinion that we broke american laws by killing him, rather then capturing him, are completely invalid.<br>

<p>That is quite a silly thing to say. It is your country that preaches to the world about the rule of law, how it’ll take the moral high-ground over other countries and their leaders ignoring this principle. Not to mention the fact it didn’t just break US law, it broke international law.</p>
<p>Our opinion is just as valid as yours, otherwise anything the US says in regards to certain international issues can’t be taken seriously coming from the US government if it is willing to make exceptions for itself.[/quote]</p>
<p>When you police the world at a cost to your own tax payers then we can do and make certain exceptions… After all, we footed the majority of the bill for the Iraq and Afghan wars.</p>

        <p>Of course. But the reputation for the US being the World Police is not a good reputation, it isn’t said in a way that is praising the country, it is said in a way that is of negative effect.</p>

<p>They killed him, buried him in the sea and now the photos are too gruesome? Confused face.</p>
<p>The average American can not explain the reasoning behind the two wars. But now that OBL is dead, there is that unconscious notion that something has been achieved and that therefore there is reason behind the wars.</p>
<p>The truth is however, the so-called ‘coalition of the willing’ has lost the war. Not only is Al-Qaeda exponentially stronger than it ever was before, citizens of the western world have had many of their freedoms jeopardized under the pretext of security.[/quote]<br>
Al Qaeda itself is horrible at planning attacks, most of the attacks are prevented and caught before they act. OBL creates long well thought out master plans that will work, in the price of time and money.</p>
<p>Obamas whole idea is, we’ve already pissed off most Muslims by throwing his body into the ocean, if we release the picture its going to swarm around the media like a “trophy” and create more hostility. They didn’t want him buried on land because his grave could possibly have become a shrine (not my words), and IIRC he needed to be buried within 24 hours.</p>

Theres still going to be terrorism, regardless of if he is dead or alive. But yeah its still awesome and a pretty nice moral victory for the US and especially for Obama’s (future) re-election campaign.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Not as organized though, just little suicide bombings.[/quote]<br>
Al Qaeda’s next leader has already stepped into charge, Bin Laden’s death hasn’t really done much to slow down terrorism and in my opinion the soldiers that were sent out to kill him were only really sent out to boost President Obama’s image for next years re-election.</p>

        <p>I almost completely agree with this article:</p>
<p>[quote]It is wrong to dismiss the al-Qaeda chief as an evil lunatic. There is a ruthless rationale to his analysis of the Muslim world and its problems.<br>
AN ELDERLY man of distinguished appearance approached me soon after I arrived in Abbottabad on the day of Osama bin Laden’s death. He spoke good English and said he was a lawyer. ‘‘Bin Laden will be remembered as good,’’ he said, ‘‘and his message was an inspiration.’’<br>
Many Pakistanis, as well as hundreds of millions of Muslims around the world, wholeheartedly concur. We in the West very rarely ask why this should be. We just assume that admirers of bin Laden are ignorant or demented fanatics.<br>

I don’t believe this is always true. More than that, I am certain that portraying bin Laden as some kind of one-dimensional monster is stupid. He wasn’t a power-hungry madman, still less the cartoon monster of pure evil caricatured by the media and political class in the West.<br>
It is time we woke up. Bin Laden was a global leader who managed to pull together miscellaneous and shambolic groups into a coherent organisation and give them an ideology. This required very considerable leadership skills, along with charisma, self-sacrifice and courage. So if we are to make sense of what happened in northern Pakistan last Monday, we need to pay the terrorist mastermind more respect.<br>
A set of very specific circumstances made his career possible. He was born into the age of Arab dictatorships, which dates roughly from the end of the Second World War. The British Empire was being wound up and replaced by something more malign.<br>
The US, the new imperial power in the region, chose to govern by proxy through a series of ruthless autocrats. These leaders, however unpleasant, often relied on their allies in the West for financial, military, intelligence and, of course, moral support.<br>
Western politicians quite liked this. They mingled easily with local elites and chose to overlook the wretched fate of those who challenged what were all too often corrupt and sometimes evil regimes. We either didn’t know or chose not to notice.<br>
It was Ayman al-Zawahiri, bin Laden’s deputy and now his likely successor, who best articulated the logic of the situation. A doctor by profession, who claims to have been tortured in Egypt’s jails, Zawahiri grasped that it was pointless to challenge his national persecutors. The real problem, he concluded, lay with their US sponsors.<br>
Zawahiri’s insight was not unique. I have a friend, Mohamed Ali, who used to be an activist in Tunisia. Ali’s 20s were dreadful. He was repeatedly tortured by the regime and on one occasion came close to death. Ultimately, he realised that further opposition was pointless, because his real opponent was not the loathsome Tunisian government, but its French sponsors. So he cut his losses and fled to London, where he became a successful businessman.<br>
Zawahiri chose a darker route. He made the famous distinction between the ‘‘near enemy’’ (that is, the local puppet regime, in his case Egypt) and the ‘‘far enemy’’ - the US. He perceived that there was no real purpose in taking on Anwar Sadat or his successor, Hosni Mubarak, and resolved to embark on a career of jihad against the US.<br>
Far from being irrational or nihilistic, the logic of this decision is hard to challenge. Zawahiri made a terrible choice. This highly intelligent man has devoted his career to cold-blooded murder. But defenders of bin Laden say this: the US is solicitous of innocent life only when it relates to US citizens. Elsewhere, it is oblivious.<br>
There have been too many moments during the decade-long hunt for bin Laden when there has appeared to be a horrible symmetry between al-Qaeda and the US. They have displayed an identical disregard for basic humanity: think of Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay and the widespread slaughter of innocents (’‘collateral damage’’) through the use of drone strikes.<br>
Consider, too, the mediaevalism of the claim from Obama that ‘‘justice has been done’’ after an unarmed man was shot dead, apparently in cold blood. Or the atavistic symbolism of the codename Geronimo, an Apache chief who fought for years to keep his tribal lands free from US control. All this from a country with such wonderful advantages: the rule of law, a tradition of liberty upheld by the sublime ideals of its founding fathers.<br>
In Pakistan, there was a small but telling episode in January when Raymond Davis, an unregistered CIA man, shot dead two locals. The US claimed diplomatic immunity and, with the complicity of the Pakistani government, secured his acquittal and hustled him out of the country, blood money having been paid to the victims’ families.<br>
So it is no surprise that a lawyer of distinguished appearance in Abbottabad should consider bin Laden a more admirable and heroic figure than the dictators who have represented American and Western interests throughout the Muslim world.<br>
There have been thousands of homilies over the past few days about how Pakistan must change its ways, turn its face against terrorism, etc, etc. A much more urgent task is to reflect on what bin Laden’s career reveals about ourselves. The Arab spring was a standing reproach to bin Laden and his friend Zawahiri. Popular movements, some inspired by fine ideals, appear to have done what al-Qaeda’s evil violence could not achieve, and swept away some of the Arab world’s dictators.<br>
But we should be cautious. There have been Arab springs before, and each time they have been sabotaged by the Western powers. It is much too soon to be clear about the real story of the Arab revolutions. The early signs are mixed. The West is helping the Libyan rebels, however clumsily. But the US has smiled on an effective invasion of tiny Bahrain by Saudi Arabia to suppress Shiite protesters.<br>
If we in the West make the wrong choice, by installing a fresh collection of client dictators, we do not just undermine democracy. We grant a fresh set of al-Qaeda leaders the moral legitimacy to pursue their hideous vendetta against the far enemy.<br>
