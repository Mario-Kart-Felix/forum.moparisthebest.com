Hindsight is 20/20, and you can’t judge someone in a situation like that, where life and death hang on split-second decisions.  Whether he had a gun in his hand with his finger on the trigger or not, the soldiers went in there knowing they were going to confront a bloodthirsty killer, who had said many times he would not be captured alive, with guns all around him.  Osama obviously went for a gun, and the soldiers could have risked life and limb to try to stop him from killing everyone there, as he no doubt would have, or they could have shot him in self defense, as they did.</p>
<p>And it isn’t your place to judge someone in a situation like that.</p>

<p>Hindsight is 20/20, and you can’t judge someone in a situation like that, where life and death hang on split-second decisions.  Whether he had a gun in his hand with his finger on the trigger or not, the soldiers went in there knowing they were going to confront a bloodthirsty killer, who had said many times he would not be captured alive, with guns all around him.  Osama obviously went for a gun, and the soldiers could have risked life and limb to try to stop him from killing everyone there, as he no doubt would have, or they could have shot him in self defense, as they did.</p>

<p>They killed him, buried him in the sea and now the photos are too gruesome? Confused face.</p>
<p>The average American can not explain the reasoning behind the two wars. But now that OBL is dead, there is that unconscious notion that something has been achieved and that therefore there is reason behind the wars.</p>
<p>The truth is however, the so-called ‘coalition of the willing’ has lost the war. Not only is Al-Qaeda exponentially stronger than it ever was before, citizens of the western world have had many of their freedoms jeopardized under the pretext of security.</p>

</aside>
<p>That is quite a silly thing to say. It is your country that preaches to the world about the rule of law, how it’ll take the moral high-ground over other countries and their leaders ignoring this principle. Not to mention the fact it didn’t just break US law, it broke international law.</p>
<p>Our opinion is just as valid as yours, otherwise anything the US says in regards to certain international issues can’t be taken seriously coming from the US government if it is willing to make exceptions for itself.</p>
