    <description>Ok so i was working on a shop that would sell dragon baxe and dragon sword right...my problem is that once in the shop the value of the item when u try to buy it doesnt match what the basevalue is in the itemdef.xml file....also when u try to buy or sell the item it doesnt do anything. i have noticed this in a few of the other private servers i used to play in...anyone know how to fix this problem? ive been looking at all the files that i think would have something to do with this and i cant figure out where the problem is...its rscd source (atleast i think it is...its the source code for project p2p i know for sure)</description>
