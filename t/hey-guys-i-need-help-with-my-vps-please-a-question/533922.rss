              <p>mate this flames guy doesn’t know shit. port forwarding has nothing to do with your operating system, and switches don’t do port forwarding because that shit doesn’t do tcp. you only need to port forward when you’re behind a shared ip address, and you’d only get this if some dork ass kid was hosting vps boxes from behind his mothers internet connection.</p>

              <p>Depends really. Generally no, you don’t have to port forward anything as switches used in datacenters have all (or most) ports open. However, depending on your host, you may have to ask them to open up your rsps port for you. It may also depend on the operating system installed in your vps. If you’re using linux (which I have a hunch you’re not) then you shouldn’t have to do much else. If you’re using windows, then it’s possible you’ll have to open your rsps port in the windows firewall. Good luck.</p>
