    <description>Okay it seems after a while of searching for sources and clients all over I run into this same exact problem everytime! I looked it up on google and moparscape and other place even on here. I&#39;m not sure what keeps causing this confusing with my client everytime I compile it. It&#39;s not something I did I just compile it to make sure it runs correctly, people keeps saying something about an older version of java or something like that, ones bigger than the other like jdk 6 running on jdk 7 or something I have no clue what there talking about! Please help me solve this asap</description>

<p>I had the same problem, update your java to the most current version then compile whatever you were trying to run and it should work. If that fails, then double check your environmental settings, and then it will work.</p>

</aside>
<p>Okay thanks and ill send you a picture of what my environmental settings are set too. Also I wasn’t trying to run anything like the client worked perfect and then I compiled it to see if the client would be okay to switch ips and do updates to it but that’s what I ended up getting before doing anything to it at all.</p>
