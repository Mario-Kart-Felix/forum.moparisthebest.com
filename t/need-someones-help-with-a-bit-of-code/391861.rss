    <title>Need someones help with a bit of code</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-someones-help-with-a-bit-of-code/391861</link>
    <description>So i have been working on this server for not to long and i was trying to add a Smithing and Mining shop to an area and this is the code i came up with for it
[code]			
} else if (NPCID == 529) {
// Smithing and Mining Shop
PutNPCCoords = true;
WanneShop = 46; //Smithing and Mining Shop
[/code]
I put that in the client.java of course

this was in shops.cfg
[code]shop = 46	Mining_and_Smithing_Shop	1	1	453	 50	451	 15000	449	 1200	447	 600	444	 250	440	 100	438	 50	436	 50	
[/code]

This is in the autospawn.cfg
[code]spawn = 529		2830	3352	0	0	0	0	0	1	Smithing_and_Mining_supplies[/code]

what did i do wrong?</description>

<p>i know that the 100 errors has to deal with a missing or extra bracket and i just fixed that now i get this error</p>
