        <p>I don’t see anything wrong with say an 18/19 year old and a 16 year old. There’s actually a mathematical rule for ‘age appropriate’ relationships. You shouldn’t seek a relationship with anyone younger than half your age plus 7.<br>
So if you were 22, then you would date someone no younger than 11 + 7, or 18 years of age.</p>
<p>If it’s within the law then there’s nothing wrong with them having sex either.<br>
I know it’s a hard thing for some people to swallow, but parents don’t ‘own’ their daughter’s right to take part in sex. In many places around the world, age of consent is 16. It’s none of the father’s business if his 16 year old daughter has sex with someone.<br>
This does mean that, in those places, a dinosaur could theoretically have sex with a 16 year old girl and, as long as she consents to it, he’s in the clear.<br>
The good news is that most 16 year old girls wouldn’t.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s hard to make a law for that though.  What if they just turned 18, can they still date a 16 year old?  What about almost 16?  Maybe 15?  Pretty soon you are down to dating 13 year olds.</p>
<p>The law here is that someone 18 or over cannot have sex with anyone not yet 18 years old.  Even if it is ‘consensual’, it is statutory rape because someone not of age can not consent.  As I said before though, no one can think that it is good for a 13 year old to have sex with a 56 year old.</p>

        <p>IIRC, statutory rape here applies to under 13’s, and is basically the pedo law - there’s no getting out of it, basically no possible defense that can be mounted. The actual age of consent for girls is 16, I believe there’s no formal age for guys? Though there is child abuse cases with older women and young guys, so I dunno how that works.</p>
<p>Essentially, the age of consent is considered to be 16.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/mopar.html">@Mopar</a>: what happens if two underage people have sex in the states, generally?</p>
<p>EDIT: As for “what about almost 16” I know a guy and girl who were 23 and 15 respectively when they got together… its like 4-5 years later now and they’re very happy.</p>
<p>I realise this is not the case always, and probably shouldn’t change law, but just pointing out that not everyones motives are to take advantage or whatever, gut reaction to things is sometimes OH GOD THATS SO WRONG and then it turns out that it really isnt</p>
<p>We did tell him he should have waited, though : &gt; Her dad was a friggin cop too</p>
<p>EDIT2: actually, upon reflection he was 21 not 23. still feels odd to me though, i cant imagine being with a 16 year old.</p>

        <p>There’s a whole bunch of information on wikipedia regarding age of consent and such in America.<br>
Across America, the minimum is 16 and the maximum seems to be 18. It’s quite random, and I don’t know why it isn’t uniform.</p>
<p>According to wikipedia, the age of consent is actually 16 in Ohio.</p>
<blockquote>Ohio
<p>The age of consent in Ohio is 16 as specified by Section 2907.04 of Ohio legislation. However there exists a close in age exception where an offender can be charged only if 18 years of age or older. However in that case, it is possible for both minors to be charged as “unruly” if brought to court {§ 2151.022}.</p>
<pre><code>2907.04 Unlawful sexual conduct with minor.

    (A) No person who is eighteen years of age or older shall engage in sexual conduct with another, who is not the spouse of the offender, when the offender knows the other person is thirteen years of age or older but less than sixteen years of age, or the offender is reckless in that regard. {§ 2907.04}.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Ohio has a close in age exception, so a 17 year old could sleep with a 15 year old and use that defence.<br>
However, if the youngest party was 16 and gave consent, she could sleep with whoever.</p>
<p>I trust the wikipedia information as they seem to be excerpts straight from the constitutions of each state.</p>
<p>Anyway, some examples of close-in-age laws I found:</p>
<blockquote>Colorado
<p>The age of consent in Colorado is 17, however there exists in the legislation close in age exceptions, which allow those aged 15 and 16 to engage in acts with those less than ten years older and those less than 15 to engage in acts with those less than four years older. However a 17-year-old can not legally consent to person that is in position of trust.</p>
<p>18-3-402(1) Any actor who knowingly inflicts sexual intrusion or sexual penetration on a victim commits sexual assault if: (d) At the time of the commission of the act, the victim is less than fifteen years of age and the actor is at least four years older than the victim and is not the spouse of the victim; or (e) At the time of the commission of the act, the victim is at least fifteen years of age but less than seventeen years of age and the actor is at least ten years older than the victim and is not the spouse of the victim;</p>
<p>Delaware</p>
<p>The age of consent in Delaware is 18, but it is legal for teenagers aged 16 and 17 to engage in sexual intercourse as long as the older partner is younger than 30.</p>
<p>Florida</p>
<p>The age of consent in Florida is 18, but close in age exemptions exist. By law, the exception permits a person 23 years of age or younger to engage in legal sexual activity with a minor aged 16 or 17.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, it’s not ‘hard’ to legislate exceptions. It certainly gets very wordy though, and reading the legislation of a few states actually did my head in. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Also, I’m in the same boat as Mopman. I couldn’t imagine having any sort of relationship with a 16 year old, for a few reasons.<br>
Firstly, they aren’t all that bright. I’d have all the power in the relationship, and that irks me (as, in my eyes, there should be equality).<br>
Secondly, 16 year olds can be pretty stupid and irritating at the best of times. Wouldn’t want to be near one on a bad day.</p>
<p>Anyway, all of the above is just my two cents.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, just to clarify, I noticed the use of the word ‘date’ above. Anybody can date. The act of dating in and of itself is inherently innocent; it doesn’t imply intimacy… although you could argue that it doesn’t preclude it, either.<br>
With that said, if a 20 year old really wanted to <span class="bbcode-b">just</span> date a 15 year old, he wouldn’t be breaking any laws. It only becomes illegal when sex comes into the equation, so it’s a very important distinction to make.</p>

        <p>Cases like these are on the edge of what is right and what isn’t. If I were the guy, I wouldn’t do it. Let’s just put the question about if it’s legal or not aside for a moment. The law says it’s illegal, and the law is what people are judged by.</p>
<p>Imagine the court case. Especially in the US, where the jury has the final word, a victim can act like a victim and convince the jury, even if the victim isn’t really a victim. What the girl can do here, is to say that she didn’t agree to have sex with the guy, and then there’s no way the jury will let the guy go. The girl can demand a huge amount of money for damages, and she’ll have fun for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>It’s hard to find out if the girl gave consent. Is a 13 year old even able to decide for him/herself? You’d expect that she wouldn’t date a guy that old, but she did. Did she know that he was that old, or did he lie to her? A case like this comes with a lot of questions, and I know that people like to judge, but let’s leave that to the judges. A case like this shouldn’t be done by a jury in the first place. Only a judge can be rational enough to see what’s really there.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/lothy.html">@Lothy</a>: That ‘rule’ only applies to normal couples. When one has a lot of power or wealth, it’s common to have a partner that could be your grandchild.</p>
