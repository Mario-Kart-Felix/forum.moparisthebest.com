    <description>Hey guys, we currently have a new server called ivorycraft, it&#39;s strictly PVP.. soon as we get the server up and going we will be adding a hunger games server as well as a faction server. We will be hosting tournament every week to month and winners will get cash or items in game. 

I&#39;d really appreciate it if some of you could look into us it&#39;d be amazing &lt;3

Thanks for your consideration everyone :)

I&#39;d appreciate if anyone would at least come check us out :)
