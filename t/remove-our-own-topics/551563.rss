Why should a user be able to lock their own topic? It’s a ridiculous suggestion. To stop flame wars? Stop spam? Why should the topic creator be the one to judge what flame or spam is? Sure, there are some legit reasons, like locking a closed advertisement or development team or whatever, but in that case report it. It doesn’t need to be locked instantly, so the pros dont outweigh the cons by a long shot.<br>

People too embarrassed about what they asked or w/e might still edit their post to say ‘REMOVE PLS’.

<p>Marking solved questions can be more beneficial than anything. When I worked on my servers, do you know how long I spent doing research because 90% of the threads go to dead ends. If there was something that said Topic Solved and linked me to the post that solved the topic that would be extremely helpful. Every other forum I use (Not RSPS Related) has this. It is extremely helpful.</p>

<p>Or how about people stop editing their posts out? It’s been said many times, if you found an answer to your question, edit the topic saying what the solution was so anyone can use the search feature in the future. Why does it need to be removed if it’s been solved? If its something extremely trivial or something like a dev/download post you want removed, use the report feature so it can be looked at. We don’t want threads with other peoples comments and such being removed by someone who might have a bias or other motive.</p>

what about the ability to remove your own topic only if there are no replies? that might solve some of the problems.<br>

<p>That isn’t perfect, but something better than the system we currently have in place is better.</p>

No, I didn’t. I have been on their site in years or looked at any of their new releases and so on… <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

Or how about people stop editing their posts out? It’s been said many times, if you found an answer to your question, edit the topic saying what the solution was so anyone can use the search feature in the future. Why does it need to be removed if it’s been solved? If its something extremely trivial or something like a dev/download post you want removed, use the report feature so it can be looked at. We don’t want threads with other peoples comments and such being removed by someone who might have a bias or other motive.<br>

If we’re talking about this, how about MITB coming up with a modification (unless SMF has one already) like IPB so we can mark the answer that answered the OP?</p>
<p>As far as things like Sk8 talking about - absolutely, we’ve needed this for too long now.[/quote]<br>
MSCP forum is open source, you can develop said modification yourself.</p>
