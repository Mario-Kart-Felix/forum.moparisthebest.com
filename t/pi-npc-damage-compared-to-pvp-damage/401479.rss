    <title>(pi) NPC damage compared to PVP damage</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-npc-damage-compared-to-pvp-damage/401479</link>
    <description>Basically my problem is that when players attack NPCs the damage is right.
But when they attack players(even with no equipment on) the damage is reduced so much that it isnt anywhere as high as it should be. (For example, AGS hitting 650 on spec against KBD, and then constantly failing to hit more than 300 on a player with no armour)

So the question is what do i change to balance this out a bit?
Thanks</description>
