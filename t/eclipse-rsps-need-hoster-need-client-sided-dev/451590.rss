    <description>[center][size=24pt]Eclipse-Rsps[/size][/center]
[size=8pt]As some of you may know, my last few releases have been apart of the Eclipse-Rsps PvP series. This version however will not be released to the public. I am going to put this online just to see how far it can go ( goal is to have 30 online at one time ). Yes this sounds like a simple goal but i will not be paying for hosting/advertisement. [/size]
[size=24pt]The Reason Why[/size]
[size=8pt]I am putting this server online because i see to many server&#39;s these days that are &quot;pk servers&quot;. Back in maybe 2009 or 2008 the deffinition of a pking server was that you PK for your items and that Player Killing was a big part of the server, but that doesnt mean spawn every item and the only thing you can do is PK. I have made the server based on Pking and Skilling for ECP Points. Everytime you level up in a skilling skill ( minning, cooking, fishing, woodcutting, ect. ) you gain 1 ECP. The rates on these skills are 2 though, so it should take fairly long to get a 99 skill. ( roughly 3 hours ). [/size]
[size=24pt]The Team Needed[/size]
[size=8pt]I will be needing
1.Website Developer 0/1
2.Hoster 0/1
[center][size=14pt]Feature&#39;s[[/size]/center]
-100% Runecrafting and Rift added.
-100% Woodcutting and Firemaking added with new zone
- Herblore Skill redone
- Smithing 95%
- Farming 50-65%
- Home
- New Slayer challenges
- Knight&#39;s Assult Minigame added
- New boss drop&#39;s added
- ECT.

[size=8pt]As some of you may know, my last few releases have been apart of the Eclipse-Rsps PvP series. This version however will not be released to the public. I am going to put this online just to see how far it can go ( goal is to have 30 online at one time ). Yes this sounds like a simple goal but i will not be paying for hosting/advertisement. [/size]<br>
[size=24pt]The Reason Why[/size]<br>
[size=8pt]I am putting this server online because i see to many server’s these days that are “pk servers”. Back in maybe 2009 or 2008 the deffinition of a pking server was that you PK for your items and that Player Killing was a big part of the server, but that doesnt mean spawn every item and the only thing you can do is PK. I have made the server based on Pking and Skilling for ECP Points. Everytime you level up in a skilling skill ( minning, cooking, fishing, woodcutting, ect. ) you gain 1 ECP. The rates on these skills are 2 though, so it should take fairly long to get a 99 skill. ( roughly 3 hours ). [/size]<br>
