    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/steps-to-a-successful-private-server-ideas/545656</link>
    <description>Alright people, Here is my opinion if you want a Successful Pk server (These opinions are based for pking focused servers).

1. Most people don&#39;t want to spend countless hours training, so approx a 10x xp rate would suffice in this manner.

2. Clan chats, Clan names, and Max sized clans, Are the ultimate pk experience, it forges rivalries, creates target groups within the game, and ultimately it&#39;s just super fun.

3. Don&#39;t incorperate rares into the game until the appropriate holiday days, Rares create edge sitters, and nobody wants that.

4. Offer higher exp rates for wilderness training, Yes killing afk trainers is gay, but it really does keep the wilderness active.

5. Every so often, Create an event where people have plenty of notice about, e.g &quot;The end of this month, we&#39;ll have a lvl 15 mith mage war, Create your accounts now!!&quot; Type of thing (just an example), The more chars people are forced to create, the more likely they are to randomly use them.

That&#39;s 5 steps for now, Anyone want to throw in some ideas? (This will be hopefully taken into consideration, for the future game owners.)</description>

<p>On topic: Awesome idea guys, I do hope someone seriously considers that smithing idea.</p>
<p>Maybe someone can introduce the “party” idea with increased exp (whether skilling or training combat). Would be cool to incorporate party mode with fighting those mini bosses for their items…maybe have a team to take down these bosses, and everyone in the party gets shared exp that could level their combat stats.</p>
<p>Idk, I’m just talking…but it’s still a good idea guys. We need more going on besides just pking…get this game to being “fun” again…it’s the same stuff, every time.</p>
<p>Share new ideas, try it out and see how it works…capitalize on this game man. It’s like a canvas waiting to be painted on.</p>

<p>This is why the forums are dying.<br>
I make a joke and because I have a god damn picture next to my name, people think I have to be some model citizen.<br>
Note: The <span class="bbcode-b">Server Helper</span> badge applies to the <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,48.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Server Help</a> section. Hence why it says “Server Helper”. It does not apply to ANY OTHER BOARD.<br>
Difference is, unlike sectional moderators, my picture stays regardless of what board I’m in.<br>
Also, bringing up sectional mods, do you think any of them stay perfect, model citizens on these forums? No. They troll, have fun, chat with others… Almost as if they’re <span class="bbcode-u">human beings</span>.</p>

<p>What exactly did your reply have to do with the forum topic? There was no reason to reply to me aside from being edgy.</p>
<p>Aside from that i think a successful rsc server should have a referral program to build a great playerbase. Something like a ::vote command.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It was a joke because a lot of people will host a server, of any sort, if they believe there is money to be made.<br>
And really, a ::vote command is the best you can come up with? Where are they going to vote for this RSC server? I haven’t seen any site that has voting for RSC. Sure they’re not excluding it, but I don’t think they’re supporting it either.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I get the joke. Its just that joke has nothing to do with the topic. Your rank says “Server Helper” so why don’t you use your knowledge to post on topic? A ::vote command seems to work fine for rsckbd(<a href="http://www.top100arena.com/in.asp?id=79496" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.top100arena.com/in.asp?id=79496</a>). At least this comment had something to do with the topic. Now let me ask you “Server Helper” what ideas do you have for making a better server?(Aside from cringe worthy comments?)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’d be harder to pull off with RSC, but something unique and different, for one.<br>
Because if RSC servers are like anything like RS2/3 servers, it’s mostly the same things that Jagex has already done, or hundreds have already done in the past that you’re just doing again.<br>
Example: The KDR “system” introduced into a 317 PI server. That now is in almost every 317 PI you ever see.<br>
And you will see people advertise it too, sadly.<br>
That isn’t “new”, and it sure as hell ain’t “unique”.</p>
<p>Lets say you want to add smithing. Smithing is rather boring. Like all you do is smelt ores to bars and bars to items.<br>
Add an extra step in there or replace one.<br>
Instead of smelting the ores, you put them into a furnace and then when it’s “finished” a monster comes out and you have to defeat it using some form of smithing tools. How well you do would be based on your level. the quality of tools would also be based on your level. Like if you were level 20, you’d have steel tools. And how well you defeated the monster would then tell you how many bars you got.</p>
<p>There’s something unique that no other server would have. Note this was all thought up and written as I went along.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not going to lie. That’s actually a really good idea. The monster could have useful drops or some kind of special cape or something that lets you show off you defeated one which proves your rank in smithing (like a bronze cape for defeating a bronze monster).<br>
[/quote]<br>
Never. Mess. With. Sk8r.[/quote]Get Rekt8r</p>

Still look for one to find a small community of pkers.   I kinda disagree, The old school players like the training on new servers, a bit of a race to flats… Thats just my opinion though.</p>

<p>It was a joke because a lot of people will host a server, of any sort, if they believe there is money to be made.<br>
And really, a ::vote command is the best you can come up with? Where are they going to vote for this RSC server? I haven’t seen any site that has voting for RSC. Sure they’re not excluding it, but I don’t think they’re supporting it either.</p>

</aside>
<p>I get the joke. Its just that joke has nothing to do with the topic. Your rank says “Server Helper” so why don’t you use your knowledge to post on topic? A ::vote command seems to work fine for rsckbd(<a href="http://www.top100arena.com/in.asp?id=79496" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.top100arena.com/in.asp?id=79496</a>). At least this comment had something to do with the topic. Now let me ask you “Server Helper” what ideas do you have for making a better server?(Aside from cringe worthy comments?)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’d be harder to pull off with RSC, but something unique and different, for one.<br>
Because if RSC servers are like anything like RS2/3 servers, it’s mostly the same things that Jagex has already done, or hundreds have already done in the past that you’re just doing again.<br>
Example: The KDR “system” introduced into a 317 PI server. That now is in almost every 317 PI you ever see.<br>
And you will see people advertise it too, sadly.<br>
That isn’t “new”, and it sure as hell ain’t “unique”.</p>
<p>Lets say you want to add smithing. Smithing is rather boring. Like all you do is smelt ores to bars and bars to items.<br>
Add an extra step in there or replace one.<br>
Instead of smelting the ores, you put them into a furnace and then when it’s “finished” a monster comes out and you have to defeat it using some form of smithing tools. How well you do would be based on your level. the quality of tools would also be based on your level. Like if you were level 20, you’d have steel tools. And how well you defeated the monster would then tell you how many bars you got.</p>
<p>There’s something unique that no other server would have. Note this was all thought up and written as I went along.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Not going to lie. That’s actually a really good idea. The monster could have useful drops or some kind of special cape or something that lets you show off you defeated one which proves your rank in smithing (like a bronze cape for defeating a bronze monster).[/quote]<br>
Never. Mess. With. Sk8r.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t even need to be to show off. You could have the monster drop an outfit (in pieces) that grants a smithing bonus. like if you wore the whole outfit you’d have 10% more of a chance from getting bars, or exp or something.</p>

At least this comment had something to do with the topic. Now let me ask you “Server Helper” what ideas do you have for making a better server?(Aside from cringe worthy comments?)[/quote]<br>
It’d be harder to pull off with RSC, but something unique and different, for one.<br>
Because if RSC servers are like anything like RS2/3 servers, it’s mostly the same things that Jagex has already done, or hundreds have already done in the past that you’re just doing again.<br>
Example: The KDR “system” introduced into a 317 PI server. That now is in almost every 317 PI you ever see.<br>
And you will see people advertise it too, sadly.<br>
That isn’t “new”, and it sure as hell ain’t “unique”.</p>
<p>Lets say you want to add smithing. Smithing is rather boring. Like all you do is smelt ores to bars and bars to items.<br>
Add an extra step in there or replace one.<br>
Instead of smelting the ores, you put them into a furnace and then when it’s “finished” a monster comes out and you have to defeat it using some form of smithing tools. How well you do would be based on your level. the quality of tools would also be based on your level. Like if you were level 20, you’d have steel tools. And how well you defeated the monster would then tell you how many bars you got.</p>
<p>There’s something unique that no other server would have. Note this was all thought up and written as I went along.</p>

<p>What exactly did your reply have to do with the forum topic? There was no reason to reply to me aside from being edgy.</p>
<p>Aside from that i think a successful rsc server should have a referral program to build a great playerbase. Something like a ::vote command.<br>
[/quote]<br>
It was a joke because a lot of people will host a server, of any sort, if they believe there is money to be made.<br>
And really, a ::vote command is the best you can come up with? Where are they going to vote for this RSC server? I haven’t seen any site that has voting for RSC. Sure they’re not excluding it, but I don’t think they’re supporting it either.[/quote]</p>
