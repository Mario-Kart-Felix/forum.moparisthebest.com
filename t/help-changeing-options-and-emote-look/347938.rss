    <description>hello i am having problems with my server

1)i look inside my cache for sprites and i see that there are emote sprites. not the word ones. but when i play the server it shows the words. can anyone help me change it bak to just pictures like runescape stile(sorry don&#39;t know how to spell). and make it have a working skillcape option

2)the other thing was when i go to the option menu it  has this thing i&#39;ve never scene before. and i have the picture sprites for the one i&#39;m familiar with. can anyone help me change it back to the original way. i would be so happy.
