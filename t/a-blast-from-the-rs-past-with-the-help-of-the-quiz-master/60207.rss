    <description>a Long long time ago Rs had a &quot;Black Hole&quot; that allowed interaction with the banned players of RuneScape with the use of the Disk of Returning, and Jagex for unknown reasons decided to rid RS of this ability forever. Private Servers do not have it either, so I plan to bring it back. The disk of returning will no longer be just another item for the collectors! I will of course provide the codes for it once it is fully finished and the bugs are worked out.</description>

              <p>Well that is interesting yet sorry to you because i have finished my project and all that remains is to work out the bugs once they are or if they are found. I have found a way to use the disk to open a gate out of nowhere which you use the disk on, once you use the disk on the door that appears you are then taken to a hole which the banned players are found, and giving them the disk allows them to leave and thus become unbanned you will need to log onto my server and i can show you it first hand. and if you mean legendscape im sorry to tell you i own copyright ownership of it as in my corporation <a href="http://LegendScape.net" rel="nofollow noopener">LegendScape.net</a>. Sorry but legendscape in server terms belongs to me and also we are partnered with microsoft.</p>

              <p>Instead of making it based by names listed on a document but make it so that when the user wishes to exit it decreases skill exp in the skill which is keeping you there.</p>
<p>On my server i made an absX, absY prison which imprisoned anyone who was above lvl 1 in skill 24. You could use the same method but the people with the disks (once activated) the exp in their skill decreases back to 0.</p>
<p>Just a suggestion.</p>
<p>Also i read about your IP based ban system on ragezone, i was going to use it on my server but i couldnt be bothered reading it all so i made my absY, absX prison :).</p>

<p>All you need is a basic jail system for all players who are within the absX &amp; absY &amp; those who have the disk use it on something &amp; BAM they are out.</p>
<p>Have fun.</p>
