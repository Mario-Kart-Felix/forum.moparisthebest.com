    <title>Runserver not working now?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runserver-not-working-now/302386</link>
    <description>Okay well I don&#39;t use Moparscape.org much, I learned Java and C# on my own. Here is the thing, I use to run a professional WoW Server and I made some money off of it. I switched to RuneScape about a year and a half ago, but instead of leeching someone I made my server from scratch, and Instead of using Text files to save characters/info I loaded them with a SQL into SQLYog (SQL Viewing Software) and it made it easier. I have been running my server for awhile and I make alot of money from donations and I don&#39;t want to shut my server down. I&#39;ve been trying to fix this error I have been getting for awhile now.

1.) I was stupid, I didn&#39;t back up my server files.
2.) I saw some really cool 317 so I thought I&#39;d check it out, so I downloaded the server and checked out some of his/her files. I accidentally dragged their Runserver.bat into my server folder (I&#39;m an idiot) and now I can&#39;t run the server.

[CODE]
@echo off
color 0a
title Server
java -Xmx512m -cp .;./jython.jar;./MySql/mysql-connector-java-3.0.08-ga-bin.jar server
pause
[/CODE]

That&#39;s what THIS runserver.bat says, everytime I run it, the Command Prompt window just says..

&quot;java is not recognized as an internal or external command&quot;

I don&#39;t remember what I had in my runserver.bat, but can anyone help me fix this?</description>

              <p>It doesn’t recognize the java version, obviously you would check your variables before posting her, as you must of learned that with a year and a half of programming rsps’s. I also suggest finding another run server code, that one isn;t the best you can get.</p>
