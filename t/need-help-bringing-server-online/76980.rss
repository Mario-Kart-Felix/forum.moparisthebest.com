              <p>Yes, you need to make your port available in the <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">“Exceptions”</span></span> tab in your firewall. Then, you need to create and host a no-ip at <a href="http://www.no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.no-ip.com</a> . You need to port forward and update your No-ip on DUC to read your DNS server.    With all that completed, it should be online.</p>
