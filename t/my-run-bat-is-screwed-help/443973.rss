              <p>What itâ€™s basically saying is that it does not support your version of java because its a lower version of java than the java it was ran on. So you might want to download and install the newest version of java here:<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-7u4-downloads-1591156.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-7u4-downloads-1591156.html</a> like [size=10pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Runescape sucks</span>[/size] said. And then change the version of java in the run.bat code to the new version of java and it should be fixed  ;D</p>
