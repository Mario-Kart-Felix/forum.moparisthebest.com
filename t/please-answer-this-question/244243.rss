              <p>easy. There are probably 3 folders like this: src,cmd,and bin. Simply go to cmd(the 1 with batchfiles in it) Edit the batch that says “run” file to your java update. When u click run a cmd prompt screen will come up and most likely say : “Starting server on port 43594…” Then once that is done, go to your 508 client, edit client .java (if u haven’t already) and scroll all the way down. You should see an ip somewhere. Change that to 127.0.0.1, then save exit. hit “build” and compile your client. Hit run and there you go =)</p>
