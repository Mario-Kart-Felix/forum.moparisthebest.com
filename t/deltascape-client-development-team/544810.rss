    <description>It&#39;ll be a small team, but a team none the less.

Following the guidelines, all that I can provide as proof is a few pictures from the current server, you can easily find DeltaScape videos on YouTube.

As soon as I get the link approved to the forums, you can see more of the nostalgic threads, if you&#39;re familiar with DeltaScape, you should be able to get there easily.

DeltaScape did die, but it&#39;s coming back.

&lt;blockquote&gt;September ‎13, ‎2009, ‏‎10:27:16AM - Entrana: Delta: &quot;We have gotten a max of 422 players online.&quot; &quot;DeltaScape has expanded so much we are back to life I&#39;m so happy and excited!&quot; &quot;The expansion project and my updates were a success! DeltaScape is back!&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;September 20, 2009, 11:45AM - 450 Player Milestone goal - Entrana: Delta: &quot;We completed our goal in a min.&quot; &quot;453 players!&quot; &quot;Fastest growing server.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The new server is based on Hyperion, which is going to keep the best aspects of the DeltaScape we all knew and loved.

As of now, the progress of the server is getting closer to a more stable state, which is why I&#39;ve created this thread.

We&#39;re currently looking for a client developer, or if need be, two.

If interested, either post or PM me with an &quot;application&quot; for evaluation.

Some notes before-hand:

[ul][*]We&#39;re hoping / wanting to start with a clean renamed client (such as a renamed 317 deob).
[*]You will be given the full credits for all of your work, and will be an official developer.
[*]The development team uses GitHub, with a git repo. Having experience with git is highly necessary.
[*]You will only be given access to the repository for the client, you will not receive access to the server repository.
[*]If the day ever comes when we require another server developer, and you should apply for it, as a developer, you will have higher priority over others.
[*]We&#39;re looking for a developer that can provide us with sufficient client work.[/ul]

Thanks in advanced.</description>
