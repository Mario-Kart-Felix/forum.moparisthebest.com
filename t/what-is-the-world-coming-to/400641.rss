    <description>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathon_Sharkey

Running for US president?

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sharkey claims to drink the blood of his girlfriends and mistresses twice a week. He has described his vampirism as &quot;a very healthy thing to do&quot; and has praised Hollywood for making vampire feeding practices &quot;romantic and erotic&quot;. He does not drink men&#39;s blood, only women&#39;s because &quot;women are beautiful...they have such beautiful necks and arms&quot;. He claims he first drank blood at age five. He also drinks cow and pig blood, preferring the former. Sharkey claims to have fangs and to be the &quot;King of the Vampire Nation&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Is this like political trolling or something?</description>

<p>it may be from how im viewing it but i didnt hear anything racist. i just heard speculation and maybe fact if they have evidence. i am not racist and would like to c the world at peace and everyone being nice to one another all the time… but one racist thing from the 2008 election was anyone who voted on obama on the mere idea(what im saying here is that all they cared about was he was black, and had no care about his politics) of him being black and to be the first black president, both those to me is racist but not exactly the same as what people normally think racism is. “Moreover, racism is the practice of the different treatment of certain a group or groups”(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism</a>)</p>
