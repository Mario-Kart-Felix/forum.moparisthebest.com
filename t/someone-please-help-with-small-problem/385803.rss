    <description>I have this private server:http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,438029.0.html

I&#39;m new to private servers. I unrared the files and set to my JDK version and compiled, set ip to 127.0.0.1...ran the server then ran the client....It loaded fine but then when i tried to login It just went back to the login screen. I may have a few things to do...Probably 1:How do i add me user account? and 2.whatever else i might need to do..I&#39;m on Vista. Thanks!</description>
