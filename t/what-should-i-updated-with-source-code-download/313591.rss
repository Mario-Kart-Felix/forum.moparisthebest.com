    <title>What should i... Updated with source code download</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-should-i-updated-with-source-code-download/313591</link>
    <description>Ok, well im leaving moparscape for awile, and i plan on coming back with something decent, and i need some idea&#39;s.

A long time ago, i release a quiz made in java, extremlly 100% basic, but it was a start, since then, i&#39;ve been too busy to start actually learning and working on more detailed games/work. BUT i REALLY plan on making a game, something small, and not something 3d like rs, something basic like,... uh pacman i guess that type of style&#39;d game, but i need some idea&#39;s/opinions on what type of game i should make/start with or atleast what an outline of a game that you would like to see.

I WILL release this when it&#39;s done, like i did with the quiz, it will be an open source, sorted in a folder and compressed, and i&#39;m hoping to make it as small as possible, and as organized as possible, this doesnt mean 3 billion folders, i just mean more sorted text files for to handle certain things, basically a 317 delta with lots of handlers?

I may ask for help or questions, and i will probably update this thread with a section for questions, and ANY help would be appreciated.

I really hope to make something decent, and hopefully impress people for once,and regarding the question, any Links, Video&#39;s, tutorial pages, websites in general, or just your own snippets would be great help for finding idea&#39;s on what to start with or for helping me with problems.

Thanks for reading, and thanks ahead of time for any idea&#39;s you explain to me.

(note): contact me via pm or this topic, i will not be checking other places on moparscape so don&#39;t wait for me to post somewhere an leech off the thread to tell me, i made this topic for reason.

Bye.

=================================

Currently using JCreator IDE btw, here&#39;s some of the stuff i read and worked off from tutorials packed into one class, there are seperate classes as well, just i decided to put them into one for my convience of faster compiling and cleaner cmd while running.
basic concept of this is, it checks the local ip, and host, then moves onto connecting to an ip, for this use any server ip, in the run.bat use
java Main *insert full ip here ex. pur3z525.no-ip.biz*

Then as a test i put an if statement to trigger the following saving, which will be used for player saving, as a result, it saves a text file called Saves.txt.

For full source codes you can get them here although i doubt experienced coders will even need use of this, seeming it was a practical tutorial + self work, should be ready to go, packed it to best quality: http://uppit.com/v/D02I2UN3

============Questions==============
ok, well i&#39;ve been debating whether or not i should just make an applet for and try and make it based off a internet browser, but i found that&#39;d be to difficult for hosting, so i decided i&#39;d stick to trying to create a client.
atm, i have no clue what i should be starting with, the only resources i found were regarding jarring files, but it didn&#39;t help, atm, i established a TCP connection sending system, although i still need to make it so something happens when it&#39;s conneted instead of nulling and disconnecting (tested on a 525 server, recieved the connection, closed, and ended it).</description>

hey, Ive got an idea. Make like stick figure game, but make it gory, and like, you can purchase guns by killing aliens. After every level or checkpoint, or anywere, there can be a gun shop. And by killing aliens you get money. So the more aliens you kill, the more money you make. The aliens get stronger and harder. And you can save your game. This may take a while to make, but people like it alot when you are able to customize your cahrecter and get new armor. You can add all of that in a shop. I can talk alot more about this, but im busy, pm me and ill tell you more about it, PEACE<br>

              <p>hey, Ive got an idea. Make like stick figure game, but make it gory, and like, you can purchase guns by killing aliens. After every level or checkpoint, or anywere, there can be a gun shop. And by killing aliens you get money. So the more aliens you kill, the more money you make. The aliens get stronger and harder. And you can save your game. This may take a while to make, but people like it alot when you are able to customize your cahrecter and get new armor. You can add all of that in a shop. I can talk alot more about this, but im busy, pm me and ill tell you more about it, PEACE</p>

              <p>Ok, well im leaving moparscape for awile, and i plan on coming back with something decent, and i need some idea’s.</p>
<p>A long time ago, i release a quiz made in java, extremlly 100% basic, but it was a start, since then, i’ve been too busy to start actually learning and working on more detailed games/work. BUT i REALLY plan on making a game, something small, and not something 3d like rs, something basic like,… uh pacman i guess that type of style’d game, but i need some idea’s/opinions on what type of game i should make/start with or atleast what an outline of a game that you would like to see.</p>
<p>I WILL release this when it’s done, like i did with the quiz, it will be an open source, sorted in a folder and compressed, and i’m hoping to make it as small as possible, and as organized as possible, this doesnt mean 3 billion folders, i just mean more sorted text files for to handle certain things, basically a 317 delta with lots of handlers?</p>
<p>I may ask for help or questions, and i will probably update this thread with a section for questions, and ANY help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>I really hope to make something decent, and hopefully impress people for once,and regarding the question, any Links, Video’s, tutorial pages, websites in general, or just your own snippets would be great help for finding idea’s on what to start with or for helping me with problems.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and thanks ahead of time for any idea’s you explain to me.</p>
<p>(note): contact me via pm or this topic, i will not be checking other places on moparscape so don’t wait for me to post somewhere an leech off the thread to tell me, i made this topic for reason.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>=================================</p>
<p>Currently using JCreator IDE btw, here’s some of the stuff i read and worked off from tutorials packed into one class, there are seperate classes as well, just i decided to put them into one for my convience of faster compiling and cleaner cmd while running.<br>
basic concept of this is, it checks the local ip, and host, then moves onto connecting to an ip, for this use any server ip, in the run.bat use<br>
java Main <em>insert full ip here ex. pur3z525.no-ip.biz</em></p>
<p>Then as a test i put an if statement to trigger the following saving, which will be used for player saving, as a result, it saves a text file called Saves.txt.</p>
<p>For full source codes you can get them here although i doubt experienced coders will even need use of this, seeming it was a practical tutorial + self work, should be ready to go, packed it to best quality: <a href="http://uppit.com/v/D02I2UN3" rel="nofollow noopener">http://uppit.com/v/D02I2UN3</a></p>

<p>============Questions==============<br>
ok, well i’ve been debating whether or not i should just make an applet for and try and make it based off a internet browser, but i found that’d be to difficult for hosting, so i decided i’d stick to trying to create a client.<br>
atm, i have no clue what i should be starting with, the only resources i found were regarding jarring files, but it didn’t help, atm, i established a TCP connection sending system, although i still need to make it so something happens when it’s conneted instead of nulling and disconnecting (tested on a 525 server, recieved the connection, closed, and ended it).</p>
