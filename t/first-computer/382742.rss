              <p>for a start your mobo only supports sata ii(retronamed to sata 3gb/s) while your harddrive is sata iii(marketing fags call this sata 6gb/s), but also scrap both since they’re both expensive, and while you’re at it scrap the ram</p>
<p>now here’s what you want to do, find the cheapest mobo that supports your cpu with at least 2 but preferably 4 sata ii connectors, buy the cheapest 4gb 1033 or whatever ram you can that is supported by the mobo, find a cheap harddrive <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148395" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">or use this one</a> and maybe find a cheaper psu and you’re good to go</p>
<p>ps I’d avoid hitachi drives like the plague, my 2tb hitachi drive sounds like its dying every time I do anything intensive on it(copying semilarge files, extracting), has a bad sector and it’s been powered on for 285 days, compared to my 500gb wd drive that smart calls healthy with 1.6 years power on time.</p>

I have a WD now and there have been no problems for the 4 years i’ve had it. I’ve had shitloads of problems with Maxtor Diamondmax 9-series (but i’m pretty sure most people have as a ton of them had a manufacturing defect). Doesn’t mean i discourage anyone from buying the new ones though.</p>
<p>PS: 8GB ram is worth it if you run a modern operating system with a decent cache system.</p>

<p>It’s the same speed, 2TB instead of 1TB, $10 cheaper, and probably a better company.  I hate Western Digital, I’ve had nothing but bad experience with them.  I’ve only had this drive for a few days, but it can’t be worse than WD.</p>
