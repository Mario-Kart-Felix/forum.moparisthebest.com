I’m a qualified electronic engineer, although obviously not highly qualified as I’m only 18 xD</p>
<p>But yeah, I got started in electronics from my pc really.  Been using a computer since I Was about 8, started programming when I was about 13 and I’ve always enjoyed understanding how things work.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Aha, I used a computer for the first time when I was 6, my bro played this game called “Ray Jay” (if I can remember correctly), and it got my attention. I started coding around 13 all because I wanted to make my own custom website not like anyone elses on <a href="http://www.freewebs.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.freewebs.com</a>, but I didnt really get into it much like most people here have. I like drawing more than anything, beside girls ima beast when it comings to “showing” my feelings. I remember my first time I got a girlfriend drawing a heart with vines attached to my cartoon character. It was so tight, i still have it as of today. (I took my shit back after we broke up lol)</p>
<p>On topic:<br>
I used to be into electronics but I ditched that hobby like 3 years ago lol. First thing I ever made was a box for lights when we had a hurricane, my mom or dad didnt know how to get lights around the house efficiently like I was able to, luckily I was there to save us during those “7” nights of no lights lol. We spent $100 worth of batteries and wire (like 20 I think), plus some switches. Took me a hour to do, I hooked it all around the main rooms in our house :D. We had sleep overs and everything lol, like 3 of our neighbors slept over that week. I didnt mind cuz I neva cant have anyone to sleep over at my house (cuz my bro got problems with people being in our house, he dont trust them cuz he think they might steal). We did good that whole week, although I wasnt able to get the microwave to work so we could warm our food up (lol I had like 10 huge batteries for 1 microwave and exploded it by mistake, I didnt look at the minimum watts on microwave rofl). The microwave was thrown away, we got another one now :D(LOL).</p>
<p>O yeah I really got into it when my teacher showed me and my classmates how to make a computer in the lab. I didnt take that knowledge far though, I abandoned it cuz I didnt feel interested about it.[/quote]</p>
<p>That was a very long rant, note: you’re an idiot.  Blowing up a microwave and connecting a load of lights to batteries (why not just use 1 battery and connect the lights in parallel?) doesn’t really constitute as doing electronics.</p>
