    <description>Umm..Forgot to add this in an earlier post....AND YES I DID USE THE SEARCH BAR TO ITS FULL USE!
Alright...I am currently editing a Deathzcape source...just really playing around with it, and I wanted to know how to add a CORRECT 474 clan chat interface. I&#39;v seen it before but I asked for it and they would never release to me....
So now I&#39;m asking the community to please help me out.
