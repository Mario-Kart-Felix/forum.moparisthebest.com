              <p>[quote=“Greeny, post:20, topic:370632”]Huge block of text, overused commas, excessive punctuation generally. Terrible sentence structure. I’m showing my maturity? Fuck you. You said you’re 15, you’re legally a child. I’m legally an adult. If we were being pedantic and talking about the real world away from the internet like you are, you’d have to show me respect and I’d get a job over you just because of my age. Age isn’t important though, neither is height or weight unless you’re challenging me to a duel or something?</p>
<p>On that note, declaring your height and weight like that only shows me you’re shit at lying. 6’3" and 72KG at 15? I’m 20, I weight 72KG and I’m 5’9". You’re either a stick or full of shit.</p>
<p>Almost everything in your post is inaccurate, neither me nor dylan made the first remark, you haven’t tried to help either of us ever. Mainly because we’ll never need your help - with anything. So your post just doesn’t make sense and I don’t even need an argument to reply. You’re so stupid you actually flamed yourself into this embarrassment.</p>
<p>No-one cares it’s your birthday either, QQ.[/quote]</p>
<p>You will never stop will you? Too bad, I don’t care, I am not going to feed your trolling asses anymore…</p>

              <p>Huge block of text, overused commas, excessive punctuation generally. Terrible sentence structure. I’m showing my maturity? Fuck you. You said you’re 15, you’re legally a child. I’m legally an adult. If we were being pedantic and talking about the real world away from the internet like you are, you’d have to show me respect and I’d get a job over you just because of my age. Age isn’t important though, neither is height or weight unless you’re challenging me to a duel or something?</p>
<p>On that note, declaring your height and weight like that only shows me you’re shit at lying. 6’3" and 72KG at 15? I’m 20, I weight 72KG and I’m 5’9". You’re either a stick or full of shit.</p>
<p>Almost everything in your post is inaccurate, neither me nor dylan made the first remark, you haven’t tried to help either of us ever. Mainly because we’ll never need your help - with anything. So your post just doesn’t make sense and I don’t even need an argument to reply. You’re so stupid you actually flamed yourself into this embarrassment.</p>
<p>No-one cares it’s your birthday either, QQ.</p>

<p>I thought of that, but it increases the file size, thanks for your positive feedback <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Dylan, Greeny, look in my last post, I knew that you couldn’t show your maturity either, you just have to smash out onto me again, look, I posted my work, and who gave the first remark? Saying this was shit? How the fuck am I the flamer, how am “I”, “teh epic noob”? Dude, I’m 15, yet im 6’3’ and around 72kg so whatever, trash talk more because, I know, that you will, post again, look ever since I joined this forum right from the start, I have tried, tried and tried to fucking help you!! What the fuck do I get? Call me immature for having my own opinion, because I know that some day being a so called ‘douchebag’ will rain back down, on you. You might end up getting shot or something, because this world isn’t all fucking flowers and blue skies, after smoking that weed, who wouldn’t believe it? Infact, also call me a troller, because I love pissing pixel people off <em>sarcasm</em>, it just fucking lightens up the world right? I have friends who have killed themselves because of it, yet you think I would do that? God you are some sad no life selfish fuckers… I’m sorry if I like using punctuation a lot, I thought it would appeal to emo’s like you, I guess I was wrong :(, Damn if you have this many issues, and you believe that you will become employed? Who the hell would employ someone like you, who thinks about what he wants, how is that going to appeal in the marketing business? You will probably treat your boss the same way and get fired within the first day… You may be a modeller, but if that’s what your good at then who am I to crush and trash your dreams? But how dare you fucking try to crush mine!! I only come back, because I want to help people, I have quit RSPS, only thing I do now is graphics, but meh…</p>
<p>The point of this ‘message’ was to get across to you dylan, about your ways, your new era of ways, also your post stating that you only treat ‘me’ like this? Isn’t that so nice? You chose me out of this whole forum, guess which day I posted this message? On my birthday!! That just proves how much you really do know about me, it’s nothing, seriously, this is a ‘forum’ on a ‘website’ sorry if that never occured to you… Seriously, if you still continue after this message, I have nothing else to say because you would have beaten me, by alot…</p>

<p>Btw Rixx, those tests probably were right loll, I might get tested soon, if I’m such a ‘moron’, I am no flamer at all, but you people are ass minded fags, you need to be taught a lesson, because in real life no one is going to tolerate you being big shots, you think I’m full of myself? Look at you dylan trying to post something cool in every post, you want moderation some day, but you will end up learning that it just goes back to the part where I said that no one will tolerate you for being big shots, enjoy this post, study it, and of course, flame it, because I know, that I will never be, a professional douchebag like you… You are the best, you win, are you happy now fatboi?[/quote]<br>
Of course I won. I’m up against someone with the intelligence of a four year old. “Fat boi?” I was currently unaware that 6’2" and 165 lbs is considered fat. You are full of yourself; you are a dumb ass; you should take a keyboarding and grammar class so that one day, you can maybe you know, not sound like a dumb ass. How do I try to sound cool? I simply state what is, and use correct grammar so that peoples eyes don’t bleed as they look at my posts. Towards the professional douche bag comment: How am I a professional douche bag when in the past while, you are the only one who I have responded harshly to? You provoke flame. You might as well leave because as is, you piss everyone off and bitch about our immaturity and say you will leave but never do.</p>
<p>Now let us put an end to this flame. I’d say we’ve each had our concluding posts.</p>

<p>You’re the worst type of flamer, one who flames and spams with grammatically inaccurate, terribly spelled posts in response to anyone who even provokes you with a hint of criticism.</p>
<p>You really don’t know the world either, unfortunately for most of us - in the real world you get to the best jobs (best paid jobs) by being a complete dick. Bankers, lawyers, corporate businessmen. Generally all douchebags. Welcome to the world son. Now go die in a fire.</p>
<p>PS. You’re not going to become a graphic designer any time soon.</p>
