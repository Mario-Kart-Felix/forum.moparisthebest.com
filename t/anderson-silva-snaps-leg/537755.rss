    <description>Holy shit I just walked in and saw Anderson Silva leg kick and snap his own leg... I don&#39;t know but from what I saw it wasn&#39;t just a crack in the joints, I saw his whole shin cave in. Is anyone a medical doctor? Is that even possible???

MAY BE DISTURBING FOR SOME:

<p>3-4 months? Wow, that is much less time than I would have thought. I hope he does return, but I must say that I doubt he’ll ever fight at the same level again.</p>
<p>I got a boxer’s fracture on my fifth metacarpal (the bone below my pinky finger) and it pushed my knuckle back so that it is about 1cm too far back (in the direction of my wrist). When I went to the hospital, I got the trainee doctor and they didn’t set my knuckle or hand back, so it healed in the position it was after the break, rather than the position before. Because of this, it is terribly weak (I break it accidentally a few times a year, from things such as hitting my hand on a table) and I am in unprovoked pain for around 30 minutes a day from it. When I write, it pushes on the area where the break was and it really hurts (close to the level of pain immediately after I broke it). This isn’t too bad normally, taking a 2 minute break after every 10-15 minutes of writing isn’t much, but in exams it’s pretty bad.</p>
<p>I fractured my fifth metacarpal a while back, but I don’t know how. I woke up one morning, no swelling but just very severe pain. I figured that because I hadn’t hit it on anything, it must have just been a long cramp or something. I played rugby the next day and at the end of the match I couldn’t walk or get my boot off. When I finally pulled it off, the entire right side of my foot was a deep purple, so I went straight to hospital. They put me in a cast, but after 5 days the pain was just as intense, if not more. I headed back to the hospital and they cut the cast off and told me that there was no break (my foot was still purple and swollen) but that it was just sprained. They referred me to a specialist but the appointment was a week away. I am medically trained, so I bandaged my foot up until the appointment. The specialist had a look (my foot was <span class="bbcode-b">still</span> swollen, but not as purple) and told me instantly that it was broken. He put me in a special boot that protected it like a cast would, but also allowed me to walk. My foot is now broken again (the break was in September) and I’ll be heading to the hospital tomorrow.</p>

<p>That sounds pretty brutal man. But I must ask, a boxers fracture is easily repaired with surgery. Why not just have the surgery?[/quote]<br>
It has calloused over, so public health care doesn’t really see it as being worth their time, and a private surgeon would be far too expensive. I will probably only get surgery if it severely breaks again in the same spot.</p>

I have no problems whatsoever at the moment (its been a year since they were inserted). My leg aches and hurts pretty bad in cold weather but that’s about it. You wouldn’t know they’re there if it wasn’t for the 3 little 4cm sides on the side of my leg, lol.</p>

Listen here dont’er. He still has his hands, knees and elbows. He may very well give up willingly but my point is that he can still fight in the octagon after some time.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>And you think he will be able to competitively fight after his leg recovers? I broke my foot nearly 6 months ago, and my hand nearly 2 years ago. I can’t stand for more than 5 minutes and I can’t write for more than about 10. He will most likely never competitively fight again, regardless of how optimistic you are.[/quote]<br>

<p>Out of curiosity though, how badly did you brake your hand to not be able to write for more than 10 minutes? Same with your foot. Was there nerve damage or something?</p>
<p>EDIT: I was doing a bit of research about Silva’s injury and what the general consensus is. One thing I forgot to mention, through recovery from these kinds of injuries is the mental side. Yes I know I said it goes away quickly when you start competing again and training, but I actually forgot when it’s hardest - right after your injury.</p>
<p>Seriously, when you’re laying in a hospital bed after being injured in a sporting event you don’t think much about it. It goes by so quickly, and you’re usually overwhelmed with attention that you forget to actually think about what has just happened - but when you’re discharged and home and you first start rounding the corner to when you’re about to begin your physiotheraphy… THAT is when it’s hard. It’s scary, it really is. When you first start trying to get movement back, everytime your leg twitches or itches (anyone who has had a brake like this can tell you, when the nerves begin healing and reattaching the itchiness is so irritating) he will think back to the sound of his leg braking.</p>
<p>So I take back when I said that this injury shouldn’t end his career. I fully empathize if it does. It made me consider retirement every morning.</p>
<p>I should also mention his recovery will probably be extended because he will more than likely have the rods removed (for an athlete such as a mixed martial artist, leaving the rod in is not smart). They make the bone weak around the rod so it might rebrake if he kicks someone. The healing after a rod is taken out is usually longer than the initial brake, lol</p>

After having my foot in a clinical boot when I broke my foot (I could take it on and off to move my foot around) it still took me around 3 weeks of practice to be able to run again. Being able to competitively fight again at the age of 40 after snapping your leg in half? No.</p>

<p>Tabby didn’t say anywhere that Silva’s talent is going to waste. His potential IS going to waste, because he’s still one of the most entertaining to watch fight, and was still in prime physical shape.</p>

              <p>There’s so many variables when estimating how long he will be out for. He may never be the same fighter he was before, and may struggle with psychological damage.</p>
<p>But given the fact he’s a top level athlete, he will have the top of the range physiotherapists etc at his disposal. Like I said, it depends on the brake (was there compartment syndrome? Did the doctor perform a fasciotomy to relieve swelling around the brake? Nerve damage?) and how determined he is to get back to good health. Then he will have to ask himself, does he want to keep fighting? He’s been there and done that… Is he still hungry to win, enough so that he’s prepared to push his broken leg passed the pain barrier to heal quicker and stronger.</p>
<p>I do hope it wasn’t caused from steroids which have been known to cause these types of injuries to many athletes, particularly soccer players and martial artists.</p>
<p>I know partially what he’s going through, 4 times this year I have woken up in the recovery room post op after an accident. Out of the 12 months that have been this year I have been on the couch with injuries 11 of them l0l.</p>

<p>I just said. I race motocross professionally. Might not strike you as a fitness demanding sport, and it’s just riding a motorbike - look into it a little. You’ll see that the fitness it demands is incredible.

<p>I’m nowhere near a “life” genius, I’m an arrogant immature 19 year old. I have just had a LOT of experience with fitness/injuries. I never finished high school, I was busy riding a motorbike and braking bones/studying health. hahaha</p>
<p>I wonder if Silva’s hardware in his leg is like mine? I’ll find the pic tomorrow.</p>

              <p>I agree with both of you, I’ve been doing sport injuries for my sport course for the past month and a lot of the time people in less aggressive/adrenaline pumping sports will think about their injury when they do that activity again and it will usually effect their performance. Take for example an English footballer called Aaron Ramsey who went into a tackle with another player and broke his tib and fib, he has said that it took him months to conjure up the confidence to go into tackles like he used to.</p>

This may seem weird to some of you but generally those type of brakes (clean brake) heal rather quickly + with little trouble. I’m also speculating that it was a clean brake of his tib &amp; fib, but it looked like it. He will have his leg plated and heal fine.</p>
<p>Shattering the bone is when it gets nasty, because that’s so hard to plate + quite often results in compartment syndrome. I’ve clean snapped my forearm (radius and ulna) and I was only out for 7 or 8 weeks, I could do almost everything after 3 weeks.<br>

From a psychological point have you recovered? meaning that if say you broke your arm playing rugby during a tackle, do you now go into tackles with less force trying to protect the break? Same goes for this guy, he may also have this injury in the back of his mind whenever he goes to kick - he might second guess himself?? Who knows…[/quote]<br>
I race dirt bikes professionally. I would rethink doing motocross if I was worried about previous injuries. Coming back from injuries sucks hard, it’s harder mentally than it is physically, but it isn’t rocket science - once you start training/competing, adrenaline takes over. If it doesn’t, you are an athlete in a very very boring sport and should probably consider retiring because you’re clearly not in your element as an athlete.</p>
<p>Given how many people I’ve seen have clean snapped tib and fibs, they usually put a rod in the tib and leave the fibula (unless it needs stabilization). Not that I know about his brake, but I’d say he’s out for 3-4 months.</p>
<blockquote>"Following Saturday evening's UFC 168 main event, former champion Anderson Silva was taken to a local Las Vegas hospital where he underwent surgery to repair a broken left leg. The successful surgery, performed by Dr. Steven Sanders, the UFC's orthopedic surgeon, inserted an intramedullary rod into Anderson's left tibia. The broken fibula was stabilized and does not require a separate surgery. Anderson will remain in the hospital for a short while, but no additional surgery is scheduled at this time. Recovery time for such injuries may vary between three and six months.
<p>"Anderson is deeply touched by the outpouring of support from his fans and the entire MMA community. There has been no immediate decision about his future, and he would kindly ask for privacy at this time as he deals with his injury and prepares to return home to recover."</p>

Guess it was a clean brake.
