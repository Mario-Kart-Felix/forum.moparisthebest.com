The best of people are always the modest ones. Take the compliment. You’ve got potential Yz. I hate to see potential go to waste, do everyone a favor and don’t let it. Like Silva, I’d hate to see his potential go to waste.</p>
<p>So as a conclusion you’d say that Silva will most likely be fit as a fiddle within 3-6 months guesstimated?<br>
[/quote]<br>
Silva is 38 and on the verge of retirement. He’s one of the best/accomplished fighters in UFC. You’re being moronic to say his talent is going to waste.[/quote]<br>
38 is still a young age, this is nowhere near retirement age but for a wealthy fighter like Silva it doesn’t matter. My father is 56 and can still hold his own in a fight and works his ass off 6 days a week at work to only get it spent on my damn internet bill. Heck, have you seen Arnold Sschwarznegger’s 66 year old biceps?</p>
<p>After discussing it with my brother I had realized that the muscle Silva worked for on that leg will turn to fat so its going to take a lot of training (if he wants) to get back to what he was or is, but we’ve already established that. It was wishful thinking he’d be up and kicking again in such a small time.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-s">When</span> <span class="bbcode-b">If</span> he returns, he will no longer just be against people nearly 10 years younger than him, but he will be against people nearly 10 years younger than him who have spent the past 2 years training, whereas he will have spent the past 2 years with his muscles deteriorating due to a lack of usage. After having my foot in a clinical boot when I broke my foot (I could take it on and off to move my foot around) it still took me around 3 weeks of practice to be able to run again. Being able to competitively fight again at the age of 40 after snapping your leg in half? No.</p>

I have no problems whatsoever at the moment (its been a year since they were inserted). My leg aches and hurts pretty bad in cold weather but that’s about it. You wouldn’t know they’re there if it wasn’t for the 3 little 4cm sides on the side of my leg, lol.</p>

I have no idea whether or not Anderson Silva will fight again, but his surgeon has already said he will be fully healed in 3-4 months. He will have severe muscle atrophy, yes, that happens when you brake bones. But the muscle comes back so quickly it’s not even a factor. He may have complications with his recovery? I think it’s been said he was planning on retiring anyway. I do hope he doesn’t retire, that’s not the ending a champion deserves but unfortunately sport is cruel.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity though, how badly did you brake your hand to not be able to write for more than 10 minutes? Same with your foot. Was there nerve damage or something?</p>
<p>EDIT: I was doing a bit of research about Silva’s injury and what the general consensus is. One thing I forgot to mention, through recovery from these kinds of injuries is the mental side. Yes I know I said it goes away quickly when you start competing again and training, but I actually forgot when it’s hardest - right after your injury.</p>
<p>Seriously, when you’re laying in a hospital bed after being injured in a sporting event you don’t think much about it. It goes by so quickly, and you’re usually overwhelmed with attention that you forget to actually think about what has just happened - but when you’re discharged and home and you first start rounding the corner to when you’re about to begin your physiotheraphy… THAT is when it’s hard. It’s scary, it really is. When you first start trying to get movement back, everytime your leg twitches or itches (anyone who has had a brake like this can tell you, when the nerves begin healing and reattaching the itchiness is so irritating) he will think back to the sound of his leg braking.</p>
<p>So I take back when I said that this injury shouldn’t end his career. I fully empathize if it does. It made me consider retirement every morning.</p>
<p>I should also mention his recovery will probably be extended because he will more than likely have the rods removed (for an athlete such as a mixed martial artist, leaving the rod in is not smart). They make the bone weak around the rod so it might rebrake if he kicks someone. The healing after a rod is taken out is usually longer than the initial brake, lol</p>

<p>3-4 months? Wow, that is much less time than I would have thought. I hope he does return, but I must say that I doubt he’ll ever fight at the same level again.</p>
<p>I got a boxer’s fracture on my fifth metacarpal (the bone below my pinky finger) and it pushed my knuckle back so that it is about 1cm too far back (in the direction of my wrist). When I went to the hospital, I got the trainee doctor and they didn’t set my knuckle or hand back, so it healed in the position it was after the break, rather than the position before. Because of this, it is terribly weak (I break it accidentally a few times a year, from things such as hitting my hand on a table) and I am in unprovoked pain for around 30 minutes a day from it. When I write, it pushes on the area where the break was and it really hurts (close to the level of pain immediately after I broke it). This isn’t too bad normally, taking a 2 minute break after every 10-15 minutes of writing isn’t much, but in exams it’s pretty bad.</p>
<p>I fractured my fifth metacarpal a while back, but I don’t know how. I woke up one morning, no swelling but just very severe pain. I figured that because I hadn’t hit it on anything, it must have just been a long cramp or something. I played rugby the next day and at the end of the match I couldn’t walk or get my boot off. When I finally pulled it off, the entire right side of my foot was a deep purple, so I went straight to hospital. They put me in a cast, but after 5 days the pain was just as intense, if not more. I headed back to the hospital and they cut the cast off and told me that there was no break (my foot was still purple and swollen) but that it was just sprained. They referred me to a specialist but the appointment was a week away. I am medically trained, so I bandaged my foot up until the appointment. The specialist had a look (my foot was <span class="bbcode-b">still</span> swollen, but not as purple) and told me instantly that it was broken. He put me in a special boot that protected it like a cast would, but also allowed me to walk. My foot is now broken again (the break was in September) and I’ll be heading to the hospital tomorrow.</p>

That sounds pretty brutal man. But I must ask, a boxers fracture is easily repaired with surgery. Why not just have the surgery?</p>

It has calloused over, so public health care doesn’t really see it as being worth their time, and a private surgeon would be far too expensive. I will probably only get surgery if it severely breaks again in the same spot.</p>
