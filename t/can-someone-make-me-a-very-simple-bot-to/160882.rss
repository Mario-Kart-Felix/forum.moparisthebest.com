    <description>Hi! Can someone make me a &quot;aimbot&quot; to game called [url=http://hockey.tk]hockey.tk[/url]? &quot;aimbot&quot; means that it shoots always the puck to the goal or most near to the pillar. You get the &quot;idea&quot; soon when you try to play that game.  if someone can make that im not sure if its possible but im very happy if someone can make. :)  And if its possible i dont think that its very hard to make. 
I can too pay someone rs2 money.
I have though that it works like this:  
When you shooting the puck, loading, making a shot, then when you press something putton the cursor goes to near the pillar and shoots it without taking the mouse left button down.
AND!!!----[u]If you make this program you&#39;ll make HISTORY!![/u]!!!!! 
Im sure that many finland hockey.tk player is ready to pay real money about that program.
it&#39;s a finland based game. 9/10 of the players are finnish.</description>
