    <title>Simba bindings for other languages?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/simba-bindings-for-other-languages/419940</link>
    <description>Since the new RS update I&#39;ve been asked more than a few times if Simba will ever support another language than Pascal. While I do not understand the inherent dislike most people ha(d|ve) for Pascal, I do understand why people would want other languages.

In fact, I have been working on support for others languages for quite some time (that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ve worked on it a _lot_, but basic support is already there). However, the support includes ([b]a subset of[/b]; for now) the Simba core functionality:


[ul][li] Mouse Functions[/li]
[li] KeyBoard Functions[/li]
[li] Colour Finding [/li]
[li] Bitmap Finding [/li]
[li] Bitmap Manipulation [/li]
[li] DTM Finding [/li]
[li] DTM Creation / Manipulation [/li]
[li] OCR Functions [/li][/ul]
 

The basic idea is to create a C-typed library called libMML (so no wicked Pascal Strings or Arrays), that all languages can load and communicate with.
Most of the code is very much proof-of-concept, but I&#39;ve written Python Bindings along with libMML.
Documentation of pyMML here: http://docs.villavu.com/simba/pymml/color.html and here http://docs.villavu.com/simba/pymml.html
There are probably quite some functions undocumented as of now, as finishing the library has a higher priority than writing documentation for me.

A lot of the functions are easily exported. Stuff like MoveMouse only uses two integers parameters, so most languages can just handle this. Exporting functions like these should be peanuts.
Right now, the bigger problem is thinking of a nice API to create and modify Bitmaps/DTMs. I think this won&#39;t be too hard either, but you&#39;ll need to know at least some stuff about memory management.

E: Another issue is that when you&#39;re looking for a colour with a huge tolerance, you can expect a BIG array of points. (Think, 60k points) Creating a Python list of all those points would hardly be usable. That&#39;s something else I haven&#39;t completely figured out. I suppose you can just not turn it into a list (read: Keep the C-array around) but then you&#39;d lack all the funny things you can do with a list.

My question to the Mopar community members is: Are you interested in being able to use the core Simba functionality in other languages?
And if so, do you want to work on it? I have a lot of work to do myself and quite frankly, libMML is not of a particular high priority to me. Finishing the project should probably not take more than a few days, that is without all the languages bindings. (I used pyMML simply to verify libMML actually worked, so you&#39;ll probably end up with at least one binding)</description>

<p>Not really, one would be able to use the MML functionality in other languages. SRL, however, will use one language (which is pascal currently).</p>

<p>Anyhow, when I get some time I’ll try to write up a real Makefile like the one used with Simba now, so it can support multiple platforms and different paths and stuff.</p>
