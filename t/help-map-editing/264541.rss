    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-map-editing/264541</link>
    <description>I Have Been trying to figure out how to edit the wourld map. not just remove an object from the map but rework the entire map. does any one know how to do this? i cant find a tut or tuts on how to do this or a program to do it nothing. all i find is hot to mova  a building or remove a bush possible even add a bush and place an npc. what i want to know is how to change the ground that you walk on. make and remove roads water. make a completely custom map. i am using BUTTER_scape_503(fullscreen_with_chat) source. i would like to stick with that source if possible. i have asked butter himself but it seems he has moved on in developing and is not maintaning his site</description>
