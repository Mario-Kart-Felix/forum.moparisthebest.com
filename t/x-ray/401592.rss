    <title>X-Ray</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/x-ray/401592</link>
    <description>THIS IS NOT A REPORT!

We need to do something about X-Ray.  Place rules against it or something?  Or at least ENFORCE the rules behind it?  I just had my house raided, the chests could not have been found without the use of X-Ray.  How do I know this?  Look at my picture:

(please note that there were dirt blocks on top of each and every piece of chest)

The red squares represent blocks that were broken to get into the chests
The green squares represent blocks that were NOT destroyed in the process.

As you can see, the X-Rayer ONLY destroyed the blocks on top of the chests.  None around it.  



So now what?  I&#39;m fucking out of 3 full chests of shit, because of something that is against the rules.  Will I get my stuff back?  Probably not....
What the hell are we supposed to do about X-Rayers?  This is just bullshit.  We need to do something.



If a mod wants to actually do something about this: The person who did it was &quot;atteto&quot;.</description>

              <p>Well I know there’s some mods that will show you where ores/items are.  Like they will highlight a diamond ore block/chest with, let’s say, a green star.  Then you can just use X-Ray to get to that ore/chest.  You are right, everything will be ok with the residential plugin, but unfortunately  with me, the plugin has come too late.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately there’s nothing that can be done to stop xray, because the anti-xray plugins don’t hide chests (they can only hide unexposed ores, and I think this sometimes causes map bugs?). The residence plugin will solve this problem though.</p>
