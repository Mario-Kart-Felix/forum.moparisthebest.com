    <title>How would you prepare?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-would-you-prepare/459831</link>
    <description>when i watch tv, I am  watching the science channel, discovery channel, history channel, nat geo wild like stuff like that. Alot of the shows now are about &quot;aliens are coming&quot; I dont know if it&#39;s true or not but theres pictures of alien ships moving fast towards earth. They might think that got kicked out of there solar system and had to leave from war or something, or they could just be searching around. well here are some pictures of the stuff they find.

http://science.discovery.com/videos/alien-encounters-space-powered-alien-ship.html


Well after you watch the video and stuff. IF it&#39;s true let&#39;s say... How would you prepare? Would you like stack up on food + water and make like a bunker. Would you be excited to meet new life? What do you think the aliens would be like. It just amazes me how fascinating this is. I mean Humas are still using natural resources to run our machines like gas! If they can make it here then there technology there is really advanced there! IF they were nice friendly aliens, what IF they shared the solar system with us? Expand our technology and science! It would be great to know alot of this stuff. Well I guess the main question being asked here is what do you think you would do if Aliens came. Do you think america should fight them? Also in the episode it said that humans natural reaction is to respond physically in our subconsious mind. We wouldnt think we just attack then realize or something lol. Ok enough with this thread I wanna know what you think !</description>

<p>Artificial elements are artificial because of their lack of stability and/or difficulty to make in natural processes. Because of that we can safely assume that everyone has the same elements.</p>
<p>What we have not consider is dark matter, but any speculations about it is purely speculative.</p>

i didnt deny that, I was just stating a theory that they could have CARBON but new elements that we are yet to discover. Like artificial elements, do you think they have natural elements that we could not have “theoretically”.<br>
This conversation is starting to lose its base, were now getting into science and I actually like it, but we keep getting more fictional <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/open_mouth.png?v=5" title=":open_mouth:" class="emoji" alt=":open_mouth:"></p>
