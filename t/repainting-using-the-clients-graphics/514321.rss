    <title>Repainting using the client&#39;s graphics</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/repainting-using-the-clients-graphics/514321</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking to create a few lines that cross each other on the game window, that follows the mouse cursor, using the client&#39;s repainting, but it&#39;s not working how I expected.

I created a little test version using JPanel and it paints the lines fine with

[code=java]
public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
super.paintComponent(g);
   . . .
}
[/code]

So I looked at the RSApplet class because this is where all the screen graphics are processed or whatever, and all the mouse listeners.

But because this class doesn&#39;t extend JPanel, it doesn&#39;t have paintComponent, and only paint(Graphics g) and update(Graphics g)

I added repaint to the mouse listeners, and when I put the code in the paint methods, it works but only when the mouse is moving and I&#39;m trying to make it constantly on the screen.

How would I do this?</description>

<p>The actual drawing code isn’t done in the paint method. It’s done in the client class using the stored Graphics in the applet class. Look at drawGameScreen in the client class and at the end of it add your code to draw the cursor. You could probably get away with using the applet’s Graphics directly to draw the lines vs creating a “RuneScape” image and drawing that.</p>

<p>I see, but I was trying to paint it rather than creating sprites etc, and if I use the stored graphics, it just paints when the mouse is moved/clicked.</p>
