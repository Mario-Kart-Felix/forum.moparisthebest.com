    <title>DDoSing, Is It Right?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ddosing-is-it-right/389084</link>
    <description>[center][b]Please keep things in this topic serious.[/b][/center]

So I recently have been thinking about DDoSing [not me DDoSing someone, just DDoSing in general], and I have been thinking of all the ups and downs to it. I can DDoS, it&#39;s very easy to do, and I&#39;ve only DDoSed one person, brought AspentX down for good because they started to DDoS my server, brought us down for a few days and now I&#39;ve lost ranks, so I decided to get back at them by DDoSing. I pretty much packed their so called &quot;DDoS protected VPS&quot; with around 63k packets and I&#39;ve brought them down for good, completely by accident. I just meant to do the same thing they did to me so they&#39;d ease up on their DDoSing, by the time I stopped DDoSing them, I had already sent about 63-75k packets to their VPS and they&#39;ve been shut down for good. So I need to do something, but I&#39;m not sure if I can even get a hold of the owner because he shut his site down because of it.

Now I realize that DDoSing is a bad thing to do, I know not to send in the double-digit thousand packets, I will still DDoS if I get DDoSed, but only to protect my server and what I&#39;ve worked for. But I never meant to put them offline, so I&#39;m coming to you guys to catch your opinions on DDoSing. Well, how would you guys handle situations with DDoSing problems and/or when you are being DDoSed. Also I&#39;d appreciate it if you sent me a quick tutorial on how to prevent DDoSing. But anyways, when they first started to DDoS me, I asked them if they could stop, you guys know the general response to that, &quot;Fuck you and your stupid ass server!&quot; Though they didn&#39;t use as well of grammar that I am. It was more like, &quot;fuck u and ur stupid ass serv!&quot; Though I warned them that they wouldn&#39;t beat me, I could tell that they were amateurs with DDoSing, and I&#39;ve done many many tests with DDoSing and got pretty well experienced with it. Also one of the staff on my server can find IP addresses, as can I, and infect them with RATs, I cannot infect people with RATs yet. So I knew they wouldn&#39;t beat me or shut me down, so I warned them multiple times, I didn&#39;t want to cause serious damage to their VPS, like I did, but they didn&#39;t stop.

So, was I right or was I wrong? I mean I gave them a good eight to twelve warnings to cut it out, though they didn&#39;t believe me, they asked me to stop after about four days, though I had already explained that I had stopped DDoSing for three days, I only really DDoSed them for about 1.2 hours. And with my DDoSer I can send about 1400 packets in two minutes, so you can do the math if you want to know the exact amount of packets I sent, but I had stopped, and after a week or so when they asked me to stop, that&#39;s when I assumed I had already sent too many packets and the server wouldn&#39;t come back online. So was DDoSing them back right or wrong?</description>

No, it is not right.  It’s not just against the rules here, it is against the LAW in just about every country.  Also it is not your only recourse to being attacked yourself, since it is against the law you can gather evidence and get their information and report it to the authorities.  Twice in the past I have reported people that attacked my server to the FBI, I don’t know what happens afterwards, but it’s probably not very good.</p>
<p>Also, despite what seems to be popular belief, you cannot use an IP address to ‘infect someone with a RAT’ or anything else.  In fact, nothing can be done with an IP address other than to report it to an authority for some type of abuse, or send packets to it.  That is all.<br>

<p>I thought you believed in self defence?[/quote]<br>
I’d say self defence in real life is different than self defence over the internet. There were other solutions to the problem other than DDoSing the guy back. In real life, if you’re faced with a situation where you have to defend yourself, there will probably be no other options.</p>
