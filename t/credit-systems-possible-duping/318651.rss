    <title>Credit systems - Possible duping?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/credit-systems-possible-duping/318651</link>
    <description>Well on my server i have made a Credit system which is like money.

As it is a pickup server i made the credit system and ways to earn the credits that you need to buy a few selected items.

But recently i&#39;ve heard that a lot of people on my server have been duping them.

Now these credits are not in item form, but the way you use them basically is like a banking card.

You can spend them when ever you need without needing to take things out of your bank.

So can you guys help me figure out how to dupe them?</description>
