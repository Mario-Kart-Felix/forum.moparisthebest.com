It is the Year 1203 and you&#39;ve just turned 23. You are a nice good looking young man/woman who wants to travel the world. Although you have loads of connections with the world you are unsure who to trust so you talk to some close friends that you&#39;ve known since your life to take you to a place you&#39;ve never been before in your Life... Lumbridge. You were born and raised in Ardougne and know everything about the place. but now you want to get going with your life and face the scarcest enemy&#39;s that exist in the game. Your own human race.

Welcome to Rune PVP. The land where no where is safe. You cannot risk anything on this server because you can get attacked from any point in the game. If you are skilling, buying items, selling items, trading with people you need to make sure that you are safe before doing so because you never know... A G maul rusher might come and just ice barrage you with a 3 hit G maul... Can you face that? Can you risk your entire life on that trade? That&#39;s the decition that you need to make.

Rune PVP is a PVP based server where you spawn items (with cash) and kill enemys all around Rune PVP. No where is safe besides the banks of the world where the Guards are protecting them with their life. Players are able to set their combat levels and spawn any items that they want (besides PVP gear etc). There&#39;s also FunPK as well as RealPK but we will get to that later... Any how here&#39;s a trailer for the server.

There are 2 types of pvp. FunPK and RealPK. FunPK you will get EP and the higher your EP the more of a threat you are so you must kill as many people as possible so you can get good drops. If not your EP will crash and tumble. The RealPK is just like being in the Wild except you&#39;re in a city. Your EP will also drop as well.

Anyway here are some pictures of the server and everything like that.
