              <p>Considering the dailyrecord article provided no sources, I’m going to go ahead and assume it’s extraordinarily biased<br>
Found this statistic about the company that owns dailyrecord, also:<br>
Net Income: US$ 588.2 million (2010)</p>
<p>During one of the worst points in the recession, the company managed to make $588M. It’s very likely that the company is mainly conservative/republican, which only reinforces the idea that the article is probably biased.</p>
<p>Actually, just found this after writing all of this:<br>
<a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8</a></p>
<p>FBI article, completely disproves the dailyreport one. According to the FBI (very reliable, mind you), firearms are the murder weapons in over 67.7% of murders. Your argument is entirely invalid. If banning firearms could even reduce that number marginally, it should be done.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Also notable, the murder volumes have gone down noticeably since the recession has started to vanish. As stated multiple times in the topic, and shown by this data, battling poverty would be the best way to combat murder and other crimes.</p>
<p>Another edit:<br>
A second data set to back up the idea of the poverty causing murder rates to increase.<br>
<a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0310.pdf" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0310.pdf</a></p>
<p>Yet another edit:<br>
The dailyreport article says this:</p>
<blockquote>Fact Number One: According to FBI crime statistics, more people are murdered each year by a hammer or a club than those killed with a rifle or shotgun (2011, 496 murders by hammer/club versus 323 murders by rifle/shotgun). Fifty-three percent more murders are committed by hammers and clubs.</blockquote>
Which is entirely true. However, the biased article seems to have left an important statistic out of the equation. Handguns have commit more than 60% of the murders every single year, which falls under the category of firearms. This makes the title of the article ("Other weapons more lethal than guns") entirely false.
<p>tl;dr Unreliable source, proven wrong in many ways</p>

The point is that you don’t need guns, I could go on a killing spree with dynamite like said in this artical : <a href="http://www.dailyrecord.com/article/20130225/NJOPINION02/302250007/Other-weapons-more-lethal-than-guns?nclick_check=1" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.dailyrecord.com/article/20130225/NJOPINION02/302250007/Other-weapons-more-lethal-than-guns?nclick_check=1</a></p>

Even if we “ban” guns people will get around the system. Also if we magically make it extremely hard to get guns, criminals can move on to knifes… Are we going to ban the use of a kitchen knife… I think not. The government cannot ban the use of my hands, I could just go strangle a person. We all need to put down our weapons, hold hands, and sing songs…</p>

              <p>Having limitations on guns are fine, and have been there for years. Those limitations are what prevent the public from having weapons such as rocket launchers or even automatic assault rifles. Of course, a criminal can get their hands on whatever gun they would like, as long as they have the money and know how to come across such a deal. If you take away the right to bare arms, then personal safety will be a huge issue and will most likely increase the death rate for victims of situations involving opposing firearms. If you remove all of the gun limitations, an increase of deaths will be seen in hostage situations.</p>

<p>They need to be taxed more. It isn’t fair that you would milk the poor for a higher tax rate.</p>
<p>I don’t think bowser was refering to this, but how about the bail-outs? You gave out $700 billion dollars of tax payer money to the richest bankers and businessmen. What did they do with this money? They are not even required to tell you. Most of the CEO’s gave themselves multi million pay bonuses, with your tax money. They were rewarded with money to collapse the economy. Biggest scam ever.</p>
<p>The least you can do now is raise their taxes and try to get back some of this money. Infact you could tax the shit out of them and they would still get to live more luxurious than we could ever imagine.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think he means things like unfair bonuses etc. I.e. Bankers tend to get nice bonuses where as people that work at the lower levels like cleaners etc would receive next to no bonus if any (common example in Britain, this probably will vary to an extent depending on the country). Working at lower levels does not mean they do not work in a skilled profession.</p>
<p>It’s a shame people work so hard and can barely pay living expenses despite working hard however quite a large value of people with influence receive much more money than they deserve.</p>

I get that they might be more easily dragged into crime but like tyb97 said, I wouldn’t vote for giving money to those who don’t have and do nothing to get it. You want money? Go earn it.</p>

<p>Note: This post is a follow-up to one written last week about guns and homicides.Controlling and regulating gun ownership is for the purpose of making society safer by reducing the rates of murder...</p>

<p>This article was quite informative really, everyone should look at it (It’s not biased toward either side really).</p>
<p>Will gun control decrease deaths by firearm? Well ofc it would, that’s just common sense.<br>
Would there still be a high crime rate? According to his research, it really hasn’t effected the crime rate at all, it all stayed the same, just little to no death by firearm, seeing as there are none.</p>
<p>Something that also caught my eye was that the poorer countries have the highest homicide rate all over the world, and have little access to guns all together.</p>
<p>I also posted a link much farther up that caught my eye, it was a U.K. new site that had a section labeled ‘knife’ crimes, which was a very lengthy list.</p>

              <p>I think that really tells the tale there. Firearm related death rates are higher than the homicide rate in the US. Meaning idiots are getting killed or killing themselves because of how easy it is to own a gun, even if they aren’t a criminal. I hate it when people argue FOR gun control only by talking about how bad it is that criminals are killing people with guns, but don’t talk about anything else, making it easy for idiots to just say ‘well hurp durp obviously if they break the law to murder people they will break the law to own a gun’. I think that’s retarded logic. Sure, of course some people will break the law to own guns. But at the same time you make it a lot harder for them to get them in the first place. The only real argument against gun control I see is for self defense, but I still think there has to be a better solution than just making it easy for people to get them.</p>

<p>I own several guns myself in Canada. Someday when I’m not lazy I’d like to get my restricted licence so I can legally own semi-automatics such as the ar15. Our gun control policies are strict, but we can own most firearms excluding fully-automatics. Like America, it would be too hard to remove all of the guns here. And sharing borders, you can imagine many of your guns are smuggled here.</p>
<p>I quoted you intentional homicide rates, but the firearm-related death rates (including accidents, suicides, etc) are quite worse.<br>
per 100,000<br>
Canada              2.13<br>
United States     10.20<br>
United Kingdom  0.25    (Obviously knives and other weapons are used much more)<br>
Mexico               11.07</p>
<p>Sometimes I think America needs to look north for policies. But in the end its an issue for democracy.</p>
<p>Of course, in Mexico you are not allowed to own a gun, and see where they are at. But thats because of a whole other issue tbh.</p>

              <p>It is very interesting to see the standpoint of different morals and values based on the upbringing here, very different. You’ll notice, those who were brought up without the need or constant reassurance of guns have no problem removing them from the community. Those who were brought up relying on gun, demand Obama’s head.</p>
<p>For some reason, i have this feeling i’ve already commented on this subject somewhere on this forum. I just can’t remember where or when it was, but it was about gun laws.</p>
<p>The reason america seems to need weapons may be because it is presented as a ‘right’ in order to speak their mind, they may believe if gun laws are taken then the other rights they have will also be reduced. They feel insecure with their government and feel that in order to feel safe from what the government may do, they must possess a firearm. The government is supposed to be a representative of the people, which, you don’t even have to vote for. No on is forcing you to choose a side, and yet, you are still unable to trust your representatives. It is horrible that you have no trust in your legal system.</p>
<p>Do you believe that without a personal weapon you would be able to protect yourself against any intruder? Every intruder isn’t going to have a gun with them, that is a sad generalisation.</p>
<p>Other countries have been able to remove guns from their community without a hassle, it appears america is the only country who doubts themselves enough to only feel protected by a firearm weapon.</p>

I feel sorry for the people that feel that they need guns, I really do. I feel pity in a different way for people that actually need them though.<br>

Why? I actually feel bad for you, because when someone breaks into your house with a .45 with the legal amount of rounds in the clip, and kills everyone in your household and takes everything.</p>
<p>If that were to happen to me and my family, he might get one of us, until he felt the firey rath of a stomach full of buckshot.[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s guns that make America so unsafe in the first place. In a country like Great Britain you don’t even have to worry about people breaking into your house or needing a firearm to protect yourself.<br>
I assume your American since only Americans keep thinking guns are a good thing. Oh and when the next shooting is happening please don’t act shocked since you support having guns</p>

              <p>For hunting we have shotguns and rifles, but there is a limit on the clip size, and you can only load it with 4 bullets. We don’t hunt with 30 rounds, and even our biggest rednecks don’t complain about that. (canada). All of our hunting guns do not require registration, but you need a licence to own them. We can also own pistols, though you cannot carry them with you.</p>

<p>In a nutshell however, I think guns should be handled at a lower level, maybe make it a state law? The higher powers need to stop touching these topics so heavily just so they can get the popular vote, they need to figure out how to get us back on track, and out of debt to avoid driving us into the ground.</p>

<p>There is a problem with different states having different gun laws. Because you could be completely banned from owning guns, and go to a neighbouring state and buy one at a gun show with no questions asked.</p>
<p>Constitutionally I think it should be a state issue. But since your government has federal drug laws, I don’t see why federal gun laws is an issue.</p>
