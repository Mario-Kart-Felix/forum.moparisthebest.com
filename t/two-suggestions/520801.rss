    <description>-Make a rule about advertisement links in signature. We don&#39;t need a bunch of people linking to jdb&#39;s.

-I noticed that the Terms of Service is for the forums not the entire site/homepage. I believe the Terms of Service should cover the homepage as a Jagex employee could look at the mopar monthly on the homepage and be like &quot;oh rs2 tutorials interesting, probable cause thanks!&quot;</description>

If this is still too limiting for people though then they should accept the reality that some malicious releases may be available to download until a moderator has the chance to intervene.</p>

              <p>Lothy the problem with that is people want to play servers with newer revision content now. Not many still would play a real 317 anymore. I admit i have even leaned towards the 317 with the higher revision npc and items packed once or twice. Either way though, there is much more freedom using your own client as well. Even if some of them dont use it within decent morals.</p>

That’s the same reasoning people are using to try and take down file upload sites. “Well hurr durr if you don’t check every upload and something copyrighted gets put up and download that makes it your fault, even if you have rules that say not to upload copyrighted content.”</p>
<p>And about manpower: Nobody ever said we don’t have enough manpower <span class="bbcode-i">right now</span>, it was said that they don’t have enough manpower to try your batshit-crazy idea and have it be effective.</p>

              <p>Not every mod claims anything about manpower, stop putting words in peoples mouths. I’ve never once claimed that. I’ve also never met a corrupt staff member here, so stop spreading complete shit. If these are your views then logout, it’s as simple as that. It’s worked for us for a good 6 coming on 7 years. We allow links to peoples sites, if they’re reported as malicious we’re going to check them out and take action on the outcome. I’ve helped you quite a few times through PM myself with what you thought infected clients so don’t even start on this bullshit. Stop manipulating peoples words and stop just complaining to be a pain in the ass. We allow links to peoples sites, that’s not us allowing links to malicious content so don’t make it out to be that.</p>

<p>Edit: Every mod I know claims they don’t have the manpower yet I don’t see them adding more manpower, not that I would blame anybody who was asked if they declined with the corrupt staff but hey!</p>
