    <title>Guys, I Need Some Advice</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/guys-i-need-some-advice/149112</link>
    <description>Now. The last thing you should do is ask advice at an online community, especially this one. :P
But, I have met some people who I care about here, yes that may seem paedophilious, but it is true. Well, enough of my jiba-jabering. Here is the question, sumed in one small sentence.

[b]I used to be good friends with these people in primary school. Come the end of year 6 they started to ditch me and insult me, so I got tired and went and got new friends at highschool. Now, all I get is these childish insults on MSN. And constantly made fun of. I want to absolutely fucking kill the fags, with my obsolete bare hands. I&#39;m at the stage with one of them, if they start with me I am going to dig him an early grave. I do not want to for some reasons, one, punishment is the biggest.[/b]

I am just getting so sick of the fun and games they have towards and about me.

[size=10pt]What should I do?[/size]</description>

              <p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:12, topic:149112”]I remember back in high school, all through freshman(1st) year this one kid made fun of me all the time.  His buddies made fun of me too.  I just ignored it all freshman year.  So sophomore(2nd) year we had Gym class together, he continued to make fun of me and I continued to ignore him, until one day when we were on the same hockey team.  He was the goalie, and I was out in front when he walked up and kicked me in the middle of the back hard, so I turned around and fucking broke the hockey stick over his arm, this was right in front of the teacher and we both got in trouble, but he nor his friends ever messed with me again.  By the end of high school I wouldn’t say we were friends, but we got along well.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: Break a fucking hockey stick over them. ;)[/quote]<br>
&lt;3 Mopar =D</p>
<p>on topic:</p>
<p>I have they same problem when I was 8 there were these kids in my neighborhood. I would always go out and play football, Soccer, basketball whatever with them and I had loads of fun. Now thats its 4 years later (I’m 12 there 13-14) they have to be the Gayest group of kids I’ve ever seen. They always make fun of me, Call me “Kid” , beam things at me and pretty much just treat me like shit. I’d hit them with a hockey stick but I don’t own one =(</p>

<p>ignoring works for verbal abuse, but not for phsical abuse. ( for obvious reasons)</p>

Ignoring them would be the worst thing to do.<br>
Your primary goal would have to be having lot’s of friends and to be well known in your area(in a positive way ofcourse)<br>
Where i live, its all about power and how well known you are.</p>
<p>How do you get popularity?You start a fight in the school or on the streets and win the fight.<br>
With popularity comes lots of friends. When you have the friends, meet with them and fight the bullys/<br>
Ofcourse this is easier said then done.</p>
<p>If you think what i said above is complete bullshit then i got some other advice for you.</p>
<p>get 2 friends to meet you and have some things you could hit hard with. Like a bat or some brass knuckles.<br>
When you see a few of the kids, run to them and hit them hard untill they’re on the ground and bleading.Tell them this was a warning.<br>
This should either scare them of or be really pissed.</p>
<p>Anyway good luck<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>dumbest idea ever…your a complete idiot…[/quote]</p>
<p>Actually he is right in a few ways. Getting into a fight and winning does usually make you popular.</p>
<p>I have been into a few fights and I have never lost. Always after a fight more people have respected me and wanted to be my friend and the person I faught became good friends with me. (this was in primary school and I always started the fights over nothing).</p>
<p>Sadly I don’t get picked on so I never really get to fight anymore because I can’t just start fights over stuff like I used to in primary school :P.</p>
<p>I would definetly fight them if I were you.[br][size=1]Posted on: October 07, 2007, 05:14:43 AM[/size][hr][quote=“blah bah7, post:40, topic:149112”]its not worth it, dont waste your energy on killing fags like that, you have better things to worry about…</p>
<p>if you kill thim their families would feel like crap, you’d be all over the news, you would be put in jail for a LONG time concidering that its many people and you would feel bad so dont waste your energy[/quote]</p>
<p>Fight them and kick their ass…Don’t kill them.</p>

I remember back in high school, all through freshman(1st) year this one kid made fun of me all the time.  His buddies made fun of me too.  I just ignored it all freshman year.  So sophomore(2nd) year we had Gym class together, he continued to make fun of me and I continued to ignore him, until one day when we were on the same hockey team.  He was the goalie, and I was out in front when he walked up and kicked me in the middle of the back hard, so I turned around and fucking broke the hockey stick over his arm, this was right in front of the teacher and we both got in trouble, but he nor his friends ever messed with me again.  By the end of high school I wouldn’t say we were friends, but we got along well.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: Break a fucking hockey stick over them. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
