    <description>Ok basicley i was just seeing if anyone could help me with this


It&#39;s just that i was thinking that to go on my server you must regester on the forums to be able to do that

Like Frugooscape or other things you have to make a forum acc to go on your server acc

So i was thinking if you can tell me where to go and what to do and all that</description>
