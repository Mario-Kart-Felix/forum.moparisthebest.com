              <p>I don’t like the word “voids” by definition, Void means a vast open space filled by nothing, which is what most Voids are nowadays :(. They are actually methods that anything at any given time can call upon it to do THIS.</p>
<p>Void’s are usually used to call upon certain small amounts of information not huge chunks that would usually be in a Handler. (if you don’t shove everything in Client.JAVA you’re going to be much better off in the long run). Here’s a basic set up for a method with a switch method in it.</p>
<p><code>public void test(int ke) {
    switch(ke)  {
	case 1:
	    sendMessage("Congrats, you have just learned how a switch\nType works, now to move on to more complicated things.");
	break;
	case 2: 
	    sendMessage("Switch with an Integer in the brackets can be used to call upon a selection of a method rather than the whole method");
	break;
	case 3:
	    sendMessage("For example, after this method I will show you how to call upon it with another method.");
	break
    }
}
public void calltest() {
    test(1);
    sendMessage("You have just called upon switchID 1 of method Test.");
}</code></p>

              <p>Actually a void is an action ALL files can reach<br>
thats why its called a PUBLIC void</p>
<p>how do you set up a void?</p>
<p>a void starts with his name and is followed by the action and what is going to happen</p>
<p>we also got voids with</p>
<p>IF’s and ELSE IF</p>
<p>we take a simple example</p>
<p>IF the kitten walks outside<br>
STARTS RAINING</p>
<p>ELSE IF (the kitten stays inside)<br>
SUNSHINE</p>
<p>another easy one in java language</p>
<p><code>public void farming()
	{
if (playerHasItemAmount(5340, 1) &amp;&amp; playerLevel[19] &gt;= 1 == true)
		{
		pEmote = 0x831;
		deleteItem(5340, getItemSlot(5340), 1);
		addItem(5339,1);
		sendMessage("You plant the seed in the patch. Now water it to make it grow");
		}
		else if (playerLevel[19] &gt;= 1 == false)
		{
			sendMessage("You Need lvl 1 farming to plant this!");
		}
	}</code><br>
Human language … IF you got the seed and farming level 1<br>
he does the action<br>
ELSE IF (You DONT got the seed and / or 1 farming)<br>
he will send a message<br>
You Need lvl 1 farming to plant this!</p>
<p>This is the basic about voids</p>
