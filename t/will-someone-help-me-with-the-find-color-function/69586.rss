    <title>Will someone help me with the find color function?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/will-someone-help-me-with-the-find-color-function/69586</link>
    <description>Hey. I&#39;m new to SCAR, but I know java, so it was easy for me to learn
I just don&#39;t get this part.
I&#39;ve identified &quot;treecolor&quot; as a string, with the color of the tree.
How come this won&#39;t work?
[code]FindColorTolerance(x,y,treecolor,5,5,515,340,30);[/code]
I look around scripts and people make them just like that.
Heres my error:
[code]Line 31: [Error] (31:20): Unknown identifier &#39;x&#39; in script[/code]
I&#39;m pretty sure itll do that with y too, so theres a problem with that. But every example I&#39;ve seen has the x, y, in there, exactly how it is.
Anyone want to help me?
-----------

Okay, so I defined the X and Y, and just changed it to findcolor for now:
Update:
[code]if(findcolor(227,193,treecolor,32,32,454,546)=True)then
ClickMouse(227, 193, true);[/code]

Error:
[code]Line 31: [Error] (31:14): Variable Expected in script[/code]

I now have SRL, but still, it comes up with the error above.

I posted the previous error because the one I have right now had this error, and I saw in other scripts, people were doing what I showed in my first post, without pre-defining X, or Y.

*Sigh* I kinda miss the { in java, in SCAR its &quot;then&quot;, and the } is &quot;end;&quot; or &quot;end.&quot; :&#39;(</description>

<p>To Include SRL. Under the Program <span class="bbcode-i">Name</span>; part. Put "{.include SRL\SRL.scar} and that will include SRL. You can download the latest SRL patch from <a href="http://www.srl-forums.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.srl-forums.com/</a> and you should be able to see the download link.</p>

              <p>you need to define x as a variable, you dont appear to know java at all lol if your getting basic principles like this wrong.</p>
<p>Also i appears you don have SRL installed, install it now it automaticaly creates all the variables you will everneed and has 100’s of useful functions.</p>
