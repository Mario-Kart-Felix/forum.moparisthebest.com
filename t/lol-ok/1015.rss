<p>Btw, try putting this for a host: cheezscape.servegame.org It's online right now.</p>

<p>This server here is up 99% of the time: scape-rune.net<br>On runestatus you just click on the authors name and their server IP is in their profile.</p>

<p>it sounds like you are the only one being one of those right now, if you would simply search around you would probably find a thread with a working ip in it, for starters I would leave the general discussion board and try server development <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>oh and titles are supposed to be related to whats in your post, for future reference <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Im not going to argue with you, but there is definitly something wrong with you. I suggest you read the rules or leave. Acting like an angry nerd isn't getting you anywhere.</p>

<p>I don't know the number though. Btw, I went to runestatus and could see all the servers easily. Open your eyes, there are many ip's on the site.</p>
