    <title>What type of coffee to use with coffeemaker?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-type-of-coffee-to-use-with-coffeemaker/341643</link>
    <description>I bought a drip coffee pot similar to this one:
[img]http://img.diytrade.com/cdimg/699553/9828408/0/1248335970/Drip_coffee_maker.jpg[/img]

At the supermarket there&#39;s a million different types of coffee powder. Which type of coffee am I supposed to use with this machine?

Is arabica coffee appropriate?</description>

<p>Every time I go to the supermarket they have a huge variety of coffee and not a single one of them is plain coffee. Now I’m wondering, the coffee for this type of machine is supposed to have a certain texture to it right? With all the varieties I’ve tried so far, some of them are fine powder and some of them are much more course. How is the coffee for this machine supposed to be?[/quote]</p>
<p>Coffee filter, any type of shit you see at the supermarket inside that, then water. Its really not as hard as you think. Unless you are trying to put beans in the coffee maker, you have to grind those up first.</p>

              <p>That’s the one I’m talking about R.I.P RSC but unfortunately it’s not the normal way they make coffee here. Everyone drinks arabic/turkish coffee here.</p>
<p>Every time I go to the supermarket they have a huge variety of coffee and not a single one of them is plain coffee. Now I’m wondering, the coffee for this type of machine is supposed to have a certain texture to it right? With all the varieties I’ve tried so far, some of them are fine powder and some of them are much more course. How is the coffee for this machine supposed to be?</p>

              <p>That’s just an ordinary coffeemaker right? Isn’t that the normal way to make coffee in your country? You just put a filter in the top thing, fill it with ground coffee, fill the other thing with water and press ‘on’. Sara lee has some good coffee brands. Here in the Netherlands we mainly use Douwe Egberts or Kanis &amp; Gunnik.</p>
