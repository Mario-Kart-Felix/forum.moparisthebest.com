    <description>[center]I realised there was a great lack of tutorials for 508 servers on here, and I have started to figure out how to do some things that there are no tutorials for. I figured people would benefit from this info so I&#39;m sharing it here. Don&#39;t post your errors here and expect me to fix them all, because I&#39;m probably just as intelligent as you are to figure them out yourself. I will try to explain the bits of code as best I can, but some I wouldn&#39;t have a clue, they just.. Work.
[i]Please say thanks if it helped you.[/i][/center]


[b]What this will teach you:[/b] How to edit and add shops into your server. Tutorial on how to add them to NPCs will probably follow when I have time.

[b]Difficulty:[/b] Eh, about 3. Or 5 if you&#39;re an idiot.

[b]Should work on:[/b] DavidScape sources, most 508&#39;s.

[b]Classes Modified:[/b] ShopHandler.java, Commands.java

[b][i]Step one:[/i][/b]
Okay so open up your ShopHandler.java (if you can&#39;t find it, simply click &quot;search&quot; in the main folder of your source, and type it in.)
You will see a lot of code that looks like this:

[code]public int[] shop4 = {9813, 11732, 3140, 4087, 1187, 4151,391,10551,4587,10828,1149,8850,121,113,11758,4675,861,892,6106, 6107, 6108, 6109, 6110, 6111,11235};
public int[] shop4n = {100,100,100, 100, 100, 100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,};
public int[] shop4p = {27000000,500000,5000000, 1000000, 500000, 15000000,300,9000000,1000000,750000,250000,500000,500,500,90000,750000,500000,100,20000,20000,20000,20000,20000,10000000};[/code]

This is the first part of what you need to do.
Go to the end of where those types of code finish (mine finishes at shop20p) and select and copy from:

[code]public int[] shop20 = {227, 249, 235, 253, 225, 255, 223, 1975, 257, 2998, 2152, 9736, 231, 12172, 12654, 259, 221, 235, 261, 231, 2970, 10111, 263, 243, 3000, 265, 239, 2481, 267, 245, 3138, 269, 247, 2998, 6693, 251};[/code]

to

[code]public int[] shop20p = {1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000};[/code]

And paste it directly beneath the last shop, so you should now have something like this:

[code]public int[] shop20 = {227, 249, 235, 253, 225, 255, 223, 1975, 257, 2998, 2152, 9736, 231, 12172, 12654, 259, 221, 235, 261, 231, 2970, 10111, 263, 243, 3000, 265, 239, 2481, 267, 245, 3138, 269, 247, 2998, 6693, 251};
public int[] shop20n ={10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000};
public int[] shop20p = {1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000};

public int[] shop20 = {227, 249, 235, 253, 225, 255, 223, 1975, 257, 2998, 2152, 9736, 231, 12172, 12654, 259, 221, 235, 261, 231, 2970, 10111, 263, 243, 3000, 265, 239, 2481, 267, 245, 3138, 269, 247, 2998, 6693, 251};
public int[] shop20n ={10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000};
public int[] shop20p = {1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000};[/code]

Or whatever shop name you copied.
Alright, good.

Next, change the number of the shop you copied to the number after it, eg. The shop I copied was 20, so I&#39;d make the copy 21.
Once you&#39;ve done that, you can delete the numbers inside the {}&#39;s of the shop21.
You&#39;ll be left with this:

[code]public int[] shop21 = {};
public int[] shop21n ={};
public int[] shop21p = {};[/code]

Now I&#39;ll explain what each one means and how to use it.

[i]public int[] shop21 = {};[/i]
The items that are in the shop. Use the same format as the other shops in your ShopHandler.java
eg.
[i]public int[] shop21 = {ITEMID, ITEMID, ITEMID};[/i]
[b]NOTE: Do NOT put duplicates of the same item if you want more of them in the shop! You can easily do that next![/b]

[i]public int[] shop21n ={};[/i]
The amount of items that are in the first int. Each spot in this represents the order the item went in the first int.
eg. if my first shop21 int had its first item as
[i]public int[] shop21 = {995};[/i]
I could tell the shop how many of 995 to stock in [i]shop21n[/i]:
[i]public int[] shop21n ={1000};[/i]
This would make the first item in the shop have 1000 of them in stock.

[i]public int[] shop21p = {};[/i]
Obvious, I would assume by now. The price of the items. Once again works in the same order as the previous two ints.
Presuming our item is 995, and our stock is 1000:
[i]public int[] shop21p = {25};[/i]
This would make the first item (995) go for 25 coins each.

Fairly straightforward? Yeah.

[i][b]Step two:[/b][/i]
So now you have your shop&#39;s items and prices, awesome.
We just have to do a little bit more to get it to work when you call it.
First, use the shortcut Ctrl + F to search for &quot;case 19&quot;. You will see this:

[code]case 19:
for (int i = 0; i &lt; shop19.length; i++) {
        if (shop19[i] != -1 &amp;&amp; shop19[i] == itemId) {
            return (shop19p[i]);
        }
}
break;[/code]

If you don&#39;t have a shop 19, just search for &quot;case *a number shop that already is in your shophandler*&quot;
Okay, so select all of case 19, up to &quot;break;&quot;, and copy it beneath it.
You will have two case 19&#39;s now, one below the other.
In one of these, you need to change the 19s, to whatever number shop you just made.
So, for example, if my shop I made was 21, I would change it to this:

[code]case 21:
for (int i = 0; i &lt; shop21.length; i++) {
        if (shop21[i] != -1 &amp;&amp; shop21[i] == itemId) {
            return (shop21p[i]);
        }
}[/code]

[b]NOTE: Cases are sections of codes applying to a certain ID. They are also used for objects and NPCs- more on this later.[/b]

Alright, once you&#39;ve done that, search for &quot;case 19&quot; again.
You&#39;ll find something like this:

[code]case 19:
                shopopen(p, 868);
                items  = shop19;
                itemsN = shop19n;
		break;[/code]

Alright, all you have to do is copy and paste this under the first one, change the 19s, to the number of your new shop, and you&#39;ve got yourself a new shop.
All this case is telling the server is where the items are, and where the item numbers are. The [i]shopopen(p, 868);[/i] I am not sure of. I assume it is just the default shop interface, someone tell me if I&#39;m wrong.
You&#39;ll be left with this:

[code]case 21:
                shopopen(p, 868);
                items  = shop21;
                itemsN = shop21n;
		break;[/code]

Congratulations on making it thus far. Just one more step to get the shop to open.

[b][i]Step three:[/i][/b]
Alright, I&#39;m going to give you a quick and easy way to get your shop open- it&#39;s not that ideal unless you like your server to have something like it, but it works to test shops and what items are in them.
Open up your Commands.java and Ctrl + F for [i]else if(cmd[0].equals[/i]
You&#39;ll find something that looks similar to this:

[code]else if(cmd[0].equals(&quot;empty&quot;)) {
for (int y = 0; y &lt; 28; y++)
for(int x = 0; x &lt; 15000; x++)
Engine.playerItems.deleteItem(p, x, y, 1000000000);
p.frames.sendMessage(p, &quot;&lt;img=1&gt;&lt;col=fff000&gt;&lt;shad=0202&gt;You have deleted all your items in your inv!&lt;img=1&gt;&quot;);

}[/code]

Underneath the last }, paste this:

[code]else if (cmd[0].equals(&quot;newshop&quot;)) {
p.getShopHandler().openshop(p, 21);
p.shopid = 21;
}[/code]

Replace 21 with your new shop number.
I think that code is self explanatory- when you type ::newshop, your shop will open.

[i][center]And that&#39;s it. I hope it helped. Thanks is always nice. Questions are welcome, I may not be able to answer them helpfully, but I&#39;ll certainly try my best :)[/center][/i]</description>

break;</code></p>
<p>If you don’t have a shop 19, just search for “case <em>a number shop that already is in your shophandler</em>”<br>
Okay, so select all of case 19, up to “break;”, and copy it beneath it.<br>
You will have two case 19’s now, one below the other.<br>
In one of these, you need to change the 19s, to whatever number shop you just made.<br>
So, for example, if my shop I made was 21, I would change it to this:</p>
<p><code>case 21:
for (int i = 0; i &lt; shop21.length; i++) {
        if (shop21[i] != -1 &amp;&amp; shop21[i] == itemId) {
            return (shop21p[i]);
        }
}</code></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">NOTE: Cases are sections of codes applying to a certain ID. They are also used for objects and NPCs- more on this later.</span></p>
<p>Alright, once you’ve done that, search for “case 19” again.<br>
You’ll find something like this:</p>
<p><code>case 19:
                shopopen(p, 868);
                items  = shop19;
                itemsN = shop19n;
		break;</code></p>
<p>Alright, all you have to do is copy and paste this under the first one, change the 19s, to the number of your new shop, and you’ve got yourself a new shop.<br>
All this case is telling the server is where the items are, and where the item numbers are. The <span class="bbcode-i">shopopen(p, 868);</span> I am not sure of. I assume it is just the default shop interface, someone tell me if I’m wrong.<br>
You’ll be left with this:</p>
<p><code>case 21:
                shopopen(p, 868);
                items  = shop21;
                itemsN = shop21n;
		break;</code></p>
<p>Congratulations on making it thus far. Just one more step to get the shop to open.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">Step three:</span></span><br>
Alright, I’m going to give you a quick and easy way to get your shop open- it’s not that ideal unless you like your server to have something like it, but it works to test shops and what items are in them.<br>
Open up your Commands.java and Ctrl + F for <span class="bbcode-i">else if(cmd[0].equals</span><br>
You’ll find something that looks similar to this:</p>
<p>[code]else if(cmd[0].equals(“empty”)) {<br>
for (int y = 0; y &lt; 28; y++)<br>
for(int x = 0; x &lt; 15000; x++)<br>
Engine.playerItems.deleteItem(p, x, y, 1000000000);<br>
p.frames.sendMessage(p, “&lt;img=1&gt;&lt;col=fff000&gt;&lt;shad=0202&gt;You have deleted all your items in your inv!&lt;img=1&gt;”);</p>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>Underneath the last }, paste this:</p>
<p><code>else if (cmd[0].equals("newshop")) {
p.getShopHandler().openshop(p, 21);
p.shopid = 21;
}</code></p>
<p>Replace 21 with your new shop number.<br>
I think that code is self explanatory- when you type ::newshop, your shop will open.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">[center]And that’s it. I hope it helped. Thanks is always nice. Questions are welcome, I may not be able to answer them helpfully, but I’ll certainly try my best :)[/center]</span></p>
