<span class="bbcode-i">Please say thanks if it helped you.</span>[/center]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What this will teach you:</span> How to edit and add shops into your server. Tutorial on how to add them to NPCs will probably follow when I have time.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Difficulty:</span> Eh, about 3. Or 5 if you’re an idiot.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Should work on:</span> DavidScape sources, most 508’s.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Classes Modified:</span> ShopHandler.java, Commands.java</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">Step one:</span></span><br>
Okay so open up your ShopHandler.java (if you can’t find it, simply click “search” in the main folder of your source, and type it in.)<br>
You will see a lot of code that looks like this:</p>
<p><code>public int[] shop4 = {9813, 11732, 3140, 4087, 1187, 4151,391,10551,4587,10828,1149,8850,121,113,11758,4675,861,892,6106, 6107, 6108, 6109, 6110, 6111,11235};
public int[] shop4n = {100,100,100, 100, 100, 100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,};
public int[] shop4p = {27000000,500000,5000000, 1000000, 500000, 15000000,300,9000000,1000000,750000,250000,500000,500,500,90000,750000,500000,100,20000,20000,20000,20000,20000,10000000};</code></p>
<p>This is the first part of what you need to do.<br>
Go to the end of where those types of code finish (mine finishes at shop20p) and select and copy from:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public int[] shop20 = {227, 249, 235, 253, 225, 255, 223, 1975, 257, 2998, 2152, 9736, 231, 12172, 12654, 259, 221, 235, 261, 231, 2970, 10111, 263, 243, 3000, 265, 239, 2481, 267, 245, 3138, 269, 247, 2998, 6693, 251};</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public int[] shop20p = {1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000};</code></pre>
<p>And paste it directly beneath the last shop, so you should now have something like this:</p>
<p>[code]public int[] shop20 = {227, 249, 235, 253, 225, 255, 223, 1975, 257, 2998, 2152, 9736, 231, 12172, 12654, 259, 221, 235, 261, 231, 2970, 10111, 263, 243, 3000, 265, 239, 2481, 267, 245, 3138, 269, 247, 2998, 6693, 251};<br>
public int[] shop20n ={10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000};<br>
public int[] shop20p = {1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000};</p>
<p>public int[] shop20 = {227, 249, 235, 253, 225, 255, 223, 1975, 257, 2998, 2152, 9736, 231, 12172, 12654, 259, 221, 235, 261, 231, 2970, 10111, 263, 243, 3000, 265, 239, 2481, 267, 245, 3138, 269, 247, 2998, 6693, 251};<br>
public int[] shop20n ={10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000};<br>
public int[] shop20p = {1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,1000};[/code]</p>
<p>Or whatever shop name you copied.<br>
Alright, good.</p>
<p>Next, change the number of the shop you copied to the number after it, eg. The shop I copied was 20, so I’d make the copy 21.<br>
Once you’ve done that, you can delete the numbers inside the {}'s of the shop21.<br>
You’ll be left with this:</p>
<p><code>public int[] shop21 = {};
public int[] shop21n ={};
public int[] shop21p = {};</code></p>
<p>Now I’ll explain what each one means and how to use it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">public int[] shop21 = {};</span><br>
The items that are in the shop. Use the same format as the other shops in your ShopHandler.java<br>
eg.<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">public int[] shop21 = {ITEMID, ITEMID, ITEMID};</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">NOTE: Do NOT put duplicates of the same item if you want more of them in the shop! You can easily do that next!</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">public int[] shop21n ={};</span><br>
The amount of items that are in the first int. Each spot in this represents the order the item went in the first int.<br>
eg. if my first shop21 int had its first item as<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">public int[] shop21 = {995};</span><br>
I could tell the shop how many of 995 to stock in <span class="bbcode-i">shop21n</span>:<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">public int[] shop21n ={1000};</span><br>
This would make the first item in the shop have 1000 of them in stock.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">public int[] shop21p = {};</span><br>
Obvious, I would assume by now. The price of the items. Once again works in the same order as the previous two ints.<br>
Presuming our item is 995, and our stock is 1000:<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">public int[] shop21p = {25};</span><br>
This would make the first item (995) go for 25 coins each.</p>
<p>Fairly straightforward? Yeah.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Step two:</span></span><br>
So now you have your shop’s items and prices, awesome.<br>
We just have to do a little bit more to get it to work when you call it.<br>
First, use the shortcut Ctrl + F to search for “case 19”. You will see this:</p>
<p><code>case 19:
for (int i = 0; i &lt; shop19.length; i++) {
        if (shop19[i] != -1 &amp;&amp; shop19[i] == itemId) {
            return (shop19p[i]);
        }
}
break;</code></p>
<p>If you don’t have a shop 19, just search for “case <em>a number shop that already is in your shophandler</em>”<br>
Okay, so select all of case 19, up to “break;”, and copy it beneath it.<br>
You will have two case 19’s now, one below the other.<br>
In one of these, you need to change the 19s, to whatever number shop you just made.<br>
So, for example, if my shop I made was 21, I would change it to this:</p>
<p><code>case 21:
for (int i = 0; i &lt; shop21.length; i++) {
        if (shop21[i] != -1 &amp;&amp; shop21[i] == itemId) {
            return (shop21p[i]);
        }
}</code></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">NOTE: Cases are sections of codes applying to a certain ID. They are also used for objects and NPCs- more on this later.</span></p>
<p>Alright, once you’ve done that, search for “case 19” again.<br>
You’ll find something like this:</p>
<p><code>case 19:
                shopopen(p, 868);
                items  = shop19;
                itemsN = shop19n;
		break;</code></p>
<p>Alright, all you have to do is copy and paste this under the first one, change the 19s, to the number of your new shop, and you’ve got yourself a new shop.<br>
All this case is telling the server is where the items are, and where the item numbers are. The <span class="bbcode-i">shopopen(p, 868);</span> I am not sure of. I assume it is just the default shop interface, someone tell me if I’m wrong.<br>
You’ll be left with this:</p>
<p><code>case 21:
                shopopen(p, 868);
                items  = shop21;
                itemsN = shop21n;
		break;</code></p>
<p>Congratulations on making it thus far. Just one more step to get the shop to open.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">Step three:</span></span><br>
Alright, I’m going to give you a quick and easy way to get your shop open- it’s not that ideal unless you like your server to have something like it, but it works to test shops and what items are in them.<br>
Open up your Commands.java and Ctrl + F for <span class="bbcode-i">else if(cmd[0].equals</span><br>
You’ll find something that looks similar to this:</p>
<p>[code]else if(cmd[0].equals(“empty”)) {<br>
for (int y = 0; y &lt; 28; y++)<br>
for(int x = 0; x &lt; 15000; x++)<br>
Engine.playerItems.deleteItem(p, x, y, 1000000000);<br>
p.frames.sendMessage(p, “&lt;img=1&gt;&lt;col=fff000&gt;&lt;shad=0202&gt;You have deleted all your items in your inv!&lt;img=1&gt;”);</p>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>Underneath the last }, paste this:</p>
<p><code>else if (cmd[0].equals("newshop")) {
p.getShopHandler().openshop(p, 21);
p.shopid = 21;
}</code></p>
<p>Replace 21 with your new shop number.<br>
I think that code is self explanatory- when you type ::newshop, your shop will open.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">[center]And that’s it. I hope it helped. Thanks is always nice. Questions are welcome, I may not be able to answer them helpfully, but I’ll certainly try my best :)[/center]</span></p>
