              <p>[quote=“I Br3ndan I, post:2, topic:201950”]In all honesty, I suggest you read up on HTTP and Java.  If you don’t enjoy reading the Java tutorials and completing them (Or if you don’t feel happy due to a sense of accomplishment), then don’t think about doing complex things such as HiScore tables.</p>
<p>Your ingame one will have to do unless you’re willing to learn a heap of stuff.  Alternatively, there’s the C+P option, which in my opinion, is absolutely worthless.  You may get fun from using the code, but what will you get from pasting it into a file when it’s not even your work?  Frustration, probably.  This goes for all of you reading this post.</p>
<p>I can’t help you any other way, sorry.  Good luck though.[/quote]</p>
<p>There’s always tuts. All the knowledge you need is to know where to put stuff and download a file :l</p>
