              <p>Well, i was hosting a server on 512mb of ram and it seemed to work well, i could have around 50 players on my server at a time (due to the player cap i put on) and it seemed to work well… and yes, more RAM would be good due to the fact that it will be able to run the server at a much better speed…</p>

<p>Fail, he will most likely use a WL source which can’t handle shit on a low ram computer. Just buy some more ram just so it can cover the running of the os, then you will have enough unused ram to handle a better built server like Hyperion, riotscape (WL but it makes the others look like shit), or another scratch. You want at least 1-2 gbs of ram for your server to be able to handle the players, skills, mini games, and other misc ram eaters.</p>

              <p>Their is no server that can do this, you really only have about 200-300mb or ram free since your most likely running windows xp which takes about 170-230 of that for a new install with all patches done. I suggest you buy more ram, a good site to use is <a href="http://tigerdirect.com" rel="nofollow noopener">tigerdirect.com</a> I payed about $100 for my 3 gbs of ram.</p>
