    <description>Some people would argue that this tutorial is pointless...it is...but it is fun, and cool to watch so anyways:

[b]HOW TO MAKE A SODA CAN FOUNTAIN:[/b]

First of all you need a soda can. I found that Diet Pepsi and Mountain Dew work the best. Lemon Lime sodas like Sprite do not work very well. First of all, shake it as hard as you can, roll it on the ground (without damaging the can!) and do whatever you can do to make the preasure build up inside it (maybe even heat it, although that can be dangerous, I did it when a person from my class had a party, and it was looking right down at the fire when it exploded, it wasn&#39;t a fun moment... :D look for a later turorial on that maybe :)). Now that the pressure is build up inside find a hard (preferably straight) strip of land, like a parking lot. Hold the can in one hand. [glow=red,2,300]Now throw it at the ground as hard as you can so it hits the ground on an angle with the top of the can hitting first.[/glow] This will cause one of the corners to implode and for soda to spray out of a hole created somewhere on the can. It is called a &quot;fountain&quot; because it sprays out. Its kind of cool. [glow=red,2,300]Also, if you do it right, the soda spraying out should act like a rocket and propel itself to do  &quot;sumersalts&quot; in the air.[/glow]

Well anyways, it is just kind of cool to watch. 

[glow=red,2,300]WARNING[/glow]:Also, be careful, if thrown at someone/something it could cause a lot 
of damage, and I am not responsible for that ;)

Enjoy.</description>

I believe using Mentos instead of shaking also works well.<br>

              <p>Doing this with a can I litterly made a missile. Get a pipe that fits the can easily and nice and snug. First shake the can A LOT like in this tutorial then put it in the pipe. I tend to shoot mine with my BB gun for this or you can pop it some other way. The can will fly out at top speed in the direction the thing is aimed and the bottom part you shoot or w/e will bust off. If you want to have fun with this make it spray into something so you don’t waste the soda</p>

              <p>Heres another way:<br>
Take a bottle of soda (24 oz. Diet Coke works best)<br>
Remove the cap.<br>
Take a pin (or safety pin), and force it through the top of the cap.<br>
Put the cap (with the pin) back on the bottle.<br>
Shake it up and build the pressure.<br>
Throw it as far as you can.</p>
<p>One of two things will happen. Either the pin will be forced out, and a lot of soda will come out of the hole. Or, the pin will come out, and the soda will come out of the hole too fast, which will just blow the cap off entirely.</p>
