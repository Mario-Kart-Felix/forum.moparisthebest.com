              <p>I hosted a server a while ago and had a staff member who had been a staff member on soulsplit for a time. He denied there being any sort of agreement between jagex and ss, but he did confirm that pim and his family are extremely wealthy, and that wealth was used for a lot of startup advertisements/paid developers/any other expense. That’s probably the main reason they’ve been up for so long. Money makes the world go 'round, right?</p>

              <p>As a long time player, SS has changed so much, their playerbase is only 1/3 of what it was in early 2012.<br>
This is because of a few things<br>
Soulsplit 2<br>
The ‘perfect’ combat system<br>
The wrecked eco</p>
<p>SoulSplit 2<br>
One step further in RSPS Clients, agreed, but the gameplay is junk compared to SS1, It’s so buggy, it downloads the cache as you play (which is bad in places like the wildy), The maps are blacktriangled all over the place, And much more.</p>
<p>The ‘perfect’ combat system<br>
No. It’s awful, its even worse than the first, wearing a blessed ss + karils/ahrims/dharok/guthan/torag/karil and the other person has 70 attack/range/mage or less, your invincible. + torva and divines def takes the mick</p>
<p>Wrecked Eco<br>
All items that are 12k credits or less have crashed badly, arcanes are now 120m, steads are 80m, bandos sets are 200m, claws are 370m, korasi 370m, ags 360m, vesta sets 80m, vls 50m<br>
you get the point</p>
<p>It’s just ruined.</p>

<p>As others have said, advertising and a dedicated team. I just noticed they have ads pretty much anywhere you navigate if you don’t have any “credits” or are a guest, which only implies they spend a significant amount of their earnings paying their team, costs for hosting, and advertising. Adding onto the discussion of a potential agreement with Jagex; it’s possible (and the most logical reason), they’ve taken down a lot of other servers but never put up a single fist against Soulsplit. However, you also have to ask yourself; if they’re doing this so called agreement, then why didn’t they do it with others that they’ve shut down?</p>

<p>I don’t believe this agreement rumor rubbish.<br>
Then again, I’ve been wrong before.</p>
