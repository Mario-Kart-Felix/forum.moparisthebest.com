    <description>I need major help with my server!

I&#39;ve followed all the guides completely for 2WIRE 2700 HG-E Router from port forward.com but they just dont seem to work!

I&#39;ve followed almost 5 guides none of those work either...

I followed what they said and how to port forward, nothing happens the only person that can connect is ME!

I tried using hamachi to connect, it works but laggs like shit so im not using it!

I tried running my server and using u-torrent to port-forward it or w/e still doesn&#39;t work...

Can someone please help me, i can connect to it with the ip&#39;s for no-ip but nobody else can!

Someone please help me, i&#39;ll pay anything even co-owner or owner on my server just anything pls..</description>

              <p>Go to your client.java file and look up playerserver   and hit enter you will see nothing with an ip so hit enter again, if you see something with an ip change that to the ip that you would like to people loggin to your server.<br>
Hit enter again and there would be another time that ip, change that one to into your ip.<br>
If this doesn’t help please inform me.<img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>You could use Utorrent which I use. I found it a lot easier than Port Forwarding. Any way first you have to download Utorrent then once you have downloaded it click onto “Options” then “Preferences” After that there should be a sidebar on the left with the option “Connections” Click onto that. This Part is the important bit. We only need to change the listening port for this to work. Make sure that “Randomize port each start” isn’t ticked. Also Change the Listening port to your servers Port For example my servers would be 43594. Another thing I would reccomend “Add Firewall Exception” is ticked and the two Enable Port mapping are as well. Then you should be done. Click Apply then Ok. This should make others able to get onto your server!</p>
