              <p>idk what type of cilent u r using but u need to use a key pressed event you can read more at <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/event/KeyEvent.html#VK_PRINTSCREEN" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/event/KeyEvent.html#VK_PRINTSCREEN</a><br>
ill write a sample snippet one: to help u and two: just encase i want to use this idea.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 02, 2008, 06:02:51 pm[/size][hr]for galkons client this goes under KeyPressed events in Applet_Sub1<code>if(i == KeyEvent.VK_PRINTSCREEN)// self-explained
	takeScreenshot(true);//action to take screen shot</code><br>
that code wonâ€™t work one: i am not the most experienced programmer(who would like a better programmer to help build my skills) two: i ownly spent a few seconds on it. But that is basicly all thats needed. and no flamen if you/anyone has a correct method please help me learn my mistake i am willing to learn but pretty much all i know is the basics. A dream i have is for one PS community to get along and work on one massive server <span class="bbcode-b">together</span> and the ones not capable via no experience to be taught by the heros/master of that community. now that community would be and have the most revolutionized server.</p>
