    <description>Not sure what to call this but I was recently messing around with the client and moparclassics ability to switch servers which led to this idea.

Your username, password and stats will be the same on all servers. You actually have the ability to choose which server you want to train on. Instead of servers where they battle for players at the same time ripping the community apart... players will have the ability to choose and not lose their stats or bank be screwed over by people hosting.

Now there is a flaw to this and that is people skilling localhost with a 1000x exp rate and basically loading up. I am sure we can do something where we isolate the core server and just allow plugins that the community approves of. Anyone can run the server and choose which plugins they allow on their server.

Why would you become a host?
Maybe if you provide a feature another server doesn&#39;t you can &quot;charge&quot; players game gold to play. Hosters can use that wealth to purchase new plugins from developers, spend it on items or whatever you can think of.</description>

<p>Do you have any other feedback in regards to why it’s a terrible idea and won’t work? That’s not much of a discussion <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
CFF brought up OpenID a while back which basically secure the password for accounts. As Lothy has pointed out and the only problem with it (unless you have other problems you can point out) is that it can be manipulated.</p>

              <p>Its a nice idea… Personally I would go a different route and only allow a set amount of ‘worlds’ that would offer different aspects of the game…</p>
<p>For example the central server would be the skilling world to allow players to train and level and gain items, From that another world would be the pking world, another would be a f2p/p2p world, then an events world and so on and so forth… Each one could be adapted to how you would like it and logs generated from each world to a shared database… This would minimise the ability to tamper with the system. If another world tried to create npc’s the central server would see this and not allow it, Maybe even remove the worlds access to the database or close the server…</p>
<p>I wouldn’t mind something like this… A little bit for everyone to mix it up…</p>

              <p>They don’t even need to freeload. The server just needs to tell the central server that however many NPCs have been killed by player X. Basically a shard in this could tell the central server that player X has gained 50k experience in the last half hour, and who is the central server to say otherwise?</p>
<p>The same with item drops. Say they can’t change the drops. However they could change the server such that NPCs frequently drop a known rare item. Again, it’s the same situation. There’s no actual way for the central server to prove or disprove the authenticity of the item.</p>
<p>The only way to know for sure that item drops and experience are authentic is if there’s constant back and forth between the central server (which is the authority over all shard servers) and the shard server.</p>

              <p>Lothy, I think it would be much more simple than that with a plugin system as the control system. It would work like this…</p>
<p>Anybody can download the “server” and when they run it it will ask them or load from a file their information (ip, port number) and let them know the steps taken to become a hoster. The owner can then choose appropriate plugins that fit what they are looking for. Plugins would range from mini games, monster locations, portals… content, whatever. Everything is predefined so you can’t freely change the exp rate or what items monsters drop unless it’s approved.</p>
<p>The problem and only problem I can see is someone hosting a server and people connect with bot clients or some form of macro and they basically free load. I am sure there is some way to battle this.</p>
<p>Tbh, I believe this is the solution to ‘fixing’ the community. It’s for the players and only benefits them. There will always be competition between servers and a while back RSCE, DQ, RSCA would allow you to transfer your stats from one server to the other. Players won’t feel obligated to train every few months because their characters will still be intact without the server drama.</p>

              <p>The idea doesn’t work unless you have some kind of trusted infrastructure in place. And by trusted I mean tamper-proof.<br>
Basically it needs to be like bitcoin mining. People on various worlds would have to somehow ‘prove’ (cryptographically) that they had performed some task.</p>
<p>For example, perhaps each log ever created in the game would have a GUID and their ‘wallet’ (to use a bitcoin term) would track the UIDs of all logs that they fletched into unstrung bows.</p>
<p>Frankly I don’t think the idea can work.</p>
