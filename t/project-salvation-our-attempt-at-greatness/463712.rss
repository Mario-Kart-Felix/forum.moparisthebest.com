Project Salvation was a project recently started by myself, and two other friends of mine on our quest to improve and expand our knowledge in the field of javascript coding and more. We believe that in a server, it should have fairly decent exp rates, not something where you max stats all in an hour something you have to work for, something that will make you want to keep coming back for more. We are also the kind of server, where we do infact pay for a lot of stuff out of our own pockets, there&#39;s no point in starting a project if your going to try to make everyone else pay for it right? We are currently hosted on a VPS, so it&#39;s 24/7 uptime and we have numerous daily updates and we are looking for more players to get more opinions on the server! We want a server where people can say an idea and people put thought in to it, and if it sounds nice it&#39;ll be added, not something where all the staff members ignore players and act like complete pricks to them, i&#39;ve played server for a long time and i know personally those are the ones that nobody likes. We are striving to perfect our server in our quest of learning and are looking for more active players to help us do so!

[ul][*]Working Korasi with special attack
[*]Dragon claws with all the new animations
[*]Working bosses, and adding more everyday (Soon Nex and WildyWyrm)
[*]Squeal of Fortune with almost a near working interface
[*]VPS Hosting for 24/7 Uptime
[*]handpicked staff from experienced members who believe that certain staff are good picks
[*]Soon to be working auto donation system
[*]No dupes
[*]Coded from a clean base, so nobody can say it&#39;s a leech, we have some features that other servers might but we made it all ourselves :)
[*]We believe in a friendly environment for players, not a stuck up one; Staff members are friendly and there is always one online nearly 24/7 to assist those who are in need of help, we also try to expect players to be helpful to each other so the community stays clean and friendly.
[*] Almost a fully working infraction system so when players commit an offence they are warned with a black mark instead of being instantly muted or banned (except in serious offences)
[*]Many daily updates, and we need you for your ideas so come join the server and let us know what you have to say! :)
[*] As always, a lot more that i can&#39;t think of you&#39;ll just have to come find out![/ul]

This server is a 317 revision, meaning we like some of the new things which we have added, but it also still has that older interface and feel for the players who aren&#39;t used too, or just don&#39;t care for all the newer interfaces available in the 641+ servers.

All the website information, and our webclient as well can be found here: http://www.projectsalvation.forumotion.com


Thanks for reading this and we hope you&#39;ll give our server a chance.</description>
