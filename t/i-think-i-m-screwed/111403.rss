    <title>I think I&quot;m screwed</title>

    <description>Hey well I&#39;ve been trying to make my own server. I can;t use hamachi cause I get an error everytime I try to install it so I&quot;m trying to use no-ip. So for my no-ip do I put my computers I.P. or my routers I.P., I tried both and they still don&#39;t work. I went to portforward.com and their tuts didn&#39;t help me (My router is airlink101w, under airlink+) I don&#39;t really get it. I tried port forwarding but when I put in the I.P. under LAN server it will only let me put in my router&#39;s I.P. not no-ip or my system IP. I don&#39;t really know what went wrong. When I launch the moparscape client I try my no-ip and my system and router I.P. but they all don&#39;t work. Also when I click run server is says server 000.0.0 I&quot;ll put in some pictures of what I&quot;ve been doing. Any help please =) I&quot;ll add more pictures if you want...[br][size=1]Posted on: June 15, 2007, 01:33:51 PM[/size][hr] uploading pic[br][size=1]Posted on: June 15, 2007, 01:41:50 PM[/size][hr]Picture:[IMG]http://i68.photobucket.com/albums/i5/hurlywiz/untitled-4.jpg[/img]</description>

              <p>You set your rule to use the UDP protocol.  Moparscape uses TCP.  Go back to router settings and set it to use TCP.</p>
