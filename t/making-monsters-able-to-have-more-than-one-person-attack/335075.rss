    <title>Making Monsters Able To Have More Than One Person Attack?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-monsters-able-to-have-more-than-one-person-attack/335075</link>
    <description>Hey guys.

Well, let me explain. Today, I added Godwars to my server, but when more than one person tries to attack one of the Bosses, it simply says &#39;Somebody is already fighting _____&#39; etc.

I was wondering if anybody would be able to quickly tell/show me how to make it so more than one person can attack these at a time? If so, that would be excellent.

Thank you,
Jackson.</description>
