    <title>Jagex allowing player-owned virtual servers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jagex-allowing-player-owned-virtual-servers/305875</link>
    <description>I was reading an article on runescape and I found this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;have to admit it was a bit of a surprise when I was told that I would now be working on RuneScape Classic! The game had not been updated for years, only a few people who had worked on it were still with the company, and nobody could really remember the details of how it worked. But Classic was about to become the basis for [u][b]a totally new idea for Jagex: player-owned virtual servers.[/b][/u] But I’m getting ahead of myself...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Then further below:

&lt;blockquote&gt;How about if players could rent and administer their own Classic servers? As a server owner, you could enable or disable any cheat codes you liked, add people to the invite list or banned list, or give individual friends any privileges you liked within your world. In this way, the activities of macroers would become pointless, as you could go on to a cheating-enabled world and get all the stuff you wanted for free if you wanted, but there would still be worlds where you’d have the satisfaction of knowing you worked for your stuff. I should explain that your character would be saved separately for each world, so you couldn’t cheat on one world then use the stuff you gained on a non-cheating world. The different rules set by the owner of each world would really make each world a different game, with different people in positions of power, wielding cheat codes and unleashing Classic’s most awesome spells and items, or making everyone work to get ahead...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This might be proof that Jagex is going to allow players to create private servers :)</description>
