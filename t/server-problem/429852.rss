    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;ve been hosting my server for about 2 months and didn&#39;t really know of the things that could go wrong if you didn&#39;t know what you were doing.... I left my house to go to my friends house and carried my computer with me, i connected to his internet to resume hosting (no, it wasn&#39;t 24/7). well i could host there or back at my house, so i tried changing no-ip and all my ip related settings and everything. But it just wouldn&#39;t let me host. This error however, didn&#39;t come up until about a week ago. (the ip problem happened about 4 weeks ago). ANYWAYS.... i need help with this error!!
