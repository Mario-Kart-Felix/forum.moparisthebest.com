This Patrick Leahy fellow seems quite intelligent! 

What especially caught my eye here was:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Leahy, who heads the Senate Appropriations Committee&#39;s sub-committee on foreign operations, was the principle sponsor of a 1997 bill prohibiting the United States from providing military assistance or funding to foreign military units suspected of human rights abuses or war crimes. The law also stipulates that the U.S. Defense Department screen foreign officers and soldiers who come to the United States for training for this purpose.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Why was this not implemented?</description>

<p>Senator Patrick Leahy claims Shayetet 13 unit, undercover Duvdevan unit, and the Israel Air Force Shaldag unit are involved in human rights violations in occupied territories.</p>
