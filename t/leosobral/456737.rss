    <description>Well, where to start, this is the I don&#39;t know which number this is that hes griefed me, every time i let him off with a warning, to just place the blocks back and don&#39;t do it again, I ask why did you do it? He says &quot;idk&quot; then &quot;i got hacked&quot; then he&#39;ll &quot;change his password&quot; then do the same thing again.

This time, the damage is more extensive, him and his friend (fcdxsza reported him) have griefed again, and quite frankly, this is the last straw, no longer going to let them off easy

Entrance to my mooshroom farm, I had about 10 in there, now theres only 4 or 5, and as you can see, hes the last person whos been in there since I was last in there, and when I was there, all my mooshrooms were there, he either stole them and took them to his village or just killed because he couldn&#39;t get them out.

One of the few smashed up blocks, he&#39;ll just randomly break some  blocks, he just says idk, not even sure why he does it....

Another here:

Destroyed some netherbrick, he always does this, sometimes he just breaks into portal room, stealing the blocks with him, not even bothering to fucking replace, and when he uh died when he went in the end portal, I found his stuff and it had everything he took, I even saw him do it. And on his way, like in this picture he&#39;ll just sneak a few blocks out on the way to the portal.</description>
