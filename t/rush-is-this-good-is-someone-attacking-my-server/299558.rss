    <description>On my server cmd it has Connection Recieved from: (Random IP) but it is appearing 3 a second, when i log into my server. My server is filled with Nulls. Up to like 10, is someone pinging my server or is this something that just happens? Hurry i need to know if i have to shutdown my server. Thanks[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 01, 2009, 09:25:54 pm[/size][hr]PS:: My server ran out of &quot;memory&quot; or something the other day, is this all the built up failed connections? Because it is pinging my IP address. I am getting my ip in the connection list. Should i be worried?</description>
