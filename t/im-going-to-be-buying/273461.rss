    <description>A 32&quot; LCD TV either late this week or sometime next week.  

I&#39;ve had my eye on one (http://www.futureshop.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp?sku_id=0665000FS10111560&amp;catid=23521&amp;logon=&amp;langid=EN - what do you think of it?) for a while now and it fits my price range perfectly.  

I&#39;ve never owned an LCD TV before so is there anything I should be looking where when deciding on one?</description>

              <p>Yeah, I am looking to do quite a bit of gaming with it, and it’s like I’m going to be comparing side-by-side the difference between games running on 720p and 1080p.  Either way, I think this is what I will be getting.</p>

<p>Sadly as the website says it only has locations in Ohio, Michigan and Indiana, which sucks for me because the $549 Samsung there would do just great.</p>

<p>You can get 32" TV’s that support 1080p, i’d look for one of them before going with that. But if you’re not bothered about getting the full HD res, then that tv is great.</p>

<p>Yeah that was my first thought, but the 1080p 32" TV’s are about $150-200 more which isn’t exactly ideal.</p>
<p>Anyways, I’m just awaiting the funds for the guitar I sold before I go ahead and buy this.</p>

              <p>It’s pretty much just a run of the mill LCD. I’d suggest going for the 1080p if you’re a gamer. And if you’re not, and you’re getting it for movies or television, get just a regular HDTV, and not an LCD. The response time is decent, pretty much like most other televisions.</p>
<p>Get it if you’re not hardcore about video quality. Since this is your first, the noticeable difference from CRT will be enough you should be content with that.</p>
