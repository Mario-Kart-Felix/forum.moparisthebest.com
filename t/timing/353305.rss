    <description>I posted this last week but no replies, still in need of the help so...

Hey.

I want to click on a door, start an animation, then teleport in to the building and then do some forcedChat, one after another.

I used (System.currentTimeMilis() - name &gt; ####) and set a time for every action, but it would just do everything in less than a second. I did delete it but I just quickly typed it up again to give you a example

[code]
if (objectId == 4487 || (objectId == 4490)) {
		
		if (System.currentTimeMillis() - FFDoor &gt; 1000) {
			int FFDoor = System.currentTimeMillis();

			startAnimation(######);
                               }
		if (System.currentTimeMillis() - FFDoor &gt; 3000) {
			getPA().movePlayer(3427, 3538, 0);
                                }
		if (System.currentTimeMillis() - FFDoor &gt; 4500) {
			forcedChat(&quot;Woah, what was that...&quot;);
					}
				}
[/code]

So, I want to execute each action after a certain time so they go through one after another and not all at once. Any help please?

Oh, and can I do

[code]
if (System.currentTimeMillis() &gt; 1000) {
[/code]

or does it have to have &quot;- FFDoor&quot;?

And does &quot;FFDoor&quot; have to be a method or is it okay like it is?</description>
