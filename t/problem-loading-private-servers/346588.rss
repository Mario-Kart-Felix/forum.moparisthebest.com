    <title>Problem loading private servers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-loading-private-servers/346588</link>
    <description>I have been trying out a bunch of private servers, but every single time it just says &quot;Sorry, an error has occurred whilst loading Runescape.&quot; It was working fine but then after old school online crashed while i was playing it hasn&#39;t worked.

P.S. I am using an iMac</description>
