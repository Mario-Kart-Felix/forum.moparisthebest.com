    <description>Well I have to finish my IT project this week. I was gonna.... Theres no need for me to explain the story. Two simple questions:

1. How can i get excel to read the first two characters of a cell and the last two characters of another cell and write that in one cell?*Resolved

2. Ive made a form, user enters information and i want that information to be written into different cells, i want them to be written into a table i have created. The data part is done all i need is a button to intitiate a function to copy the new data and clear the cells. Can this be done with a macro? Or any other way? How?


Thankyou for taking the time to read my questions, i hope you will be able to help me.
