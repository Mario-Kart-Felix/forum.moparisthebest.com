<p>Just try ignoring it and once you forget to notice your heart beating fast it will probably stop.</p>
<p>But then again, you have to make sacrifices to get high. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>

<p>Yeah, ignoring it. If you think about it, its less likely to stop and if you are worrying about it, its even less likely to stop than thinking about it.</p>

<p>Heart rate does increase when you smoke weed, but almost certainly not to the point where it’s going to cause problems. You are experiencing anxiety, worrying about it is making it worse. Distract yourself with something tasty to eat or fun to do.</p>
