    <title>What has your school done for homecoming?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-has-your-school-done-for-homecoming/305436</link>
    <description>Well, for any of the schools who HAVE had it already: What did your school do/what did you participate in? We are still in the homecoming week. Events we have had: (** Means I participated in them)

**-Tug O&#39; War - Everyone knows what this is.

-Relay - People had to race against others to grab a scooter, roll down a huge hill by our school, and run across the football field in scuba diving flippers.

-Scooter Race - Name says all, different racing positions on scooters

**-Fear Factor - You were given questions that you had to answer. These questions ranged from sports teams to when the school was created. If you got the question WRONG, someone added a topping to a 2-scoop bowl of ice cream in front of you. These toppings were stuff like this:


[ul][li]Onions[/li]
[li]Dill Relish[/li]
[li]Cheetos[/li]
[li]Snickers[/li]
[li]Marshmallows[/li]
[li]M&amp;Ms[/li]
[li]French Dressing[/li]
[li]Ranch dressing[/li]
[li]mushrooms[/li][/ul]


It was digusting, and with 4 other people, I puked. It was horrible, the texture just made you gag by itself. Everyone had to race at the end to finish their ice cream first. It was horrible/hilarious at the same time.

-Helping Hand - 2 people are blindfolded and hooked together, the person in back had to do tasks such as putting lipstick on the person in the front of them.

-Twister - Played like the normal game, but with relish on green, mustard on yellow, etc. A layer of dish soap was added on the top.

What have/has you/your school done for homecoming? If you haven&#39;t had homecoming yet, then post when you do have it.</description>

              <p>My school was lame. First was homecoming week, and it went: Neon, spirit, decade, character, Toga. Basically, each day we had to wear what the day was. But the assembly was amazing. I’m a senior, and the assembly theme was Cirque du Royale, so we had some professional circus performers com in. Two guys juggled knives over 4 guys laid out like a table, and then there was the contortionist and the acrobat. Let me just say this, two lesbians performing no handed moves between eachothers legs, and bending into amazing positions.</p>
<p>But that was about it.</p>
