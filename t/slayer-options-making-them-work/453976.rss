    <title>Slayer Options - Making them work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/slayer-options-making-them-work/453976</link>
    <description>Hey guys I was wondering how do I get my shop to open using my Slayer master Kuradal.

So far these are my options for Kuradal and Duradel:
Talk
Get Task
Teleport
Rewards

I have three of them working except for Rewards. I was wondering how would I open that up and make it become a Slayer Shop. I got the shop all set up, but I just can&#39;t figure out how to open that Rewards option.</description>
