    <title>Tile Based Map Editor v1.2 - Includes tile sets</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tile-based-map-editor-v1-2-includes-tile-sets/411283</link>
    <description>This is a one size (currently) tile based map editor, with a nice tile set included. 
Ill you need to do is download my [url=http://davidscape.org/MapEditor.zip]map editor[/url] (thanks to Budda for the GUI skeleton!) and get drawing!

How to use the map editor:

[ol][li]Extract the folder[/li]
[li]If on a windows pc, you should be able to just double click on the jar and run it. If that doesn&#39;t work or you are on a unix system, cd to where you extracted the folder and use [tt]java -jar MapEditor.jar[/tt][/li]
[li]Click New Map. The main editor GUI will now pop up:
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/JfbdW.png[/img][/li]
[li]Obviously we don&#39;t want an entire black map! To load a tile set, go to [i]File - Load Tile Folder[/i]. It should automatically load into the &#39;title&#39; directory of the data folder, if it doesn&#39;t, navigate there. Select a folder that you want to load. You can browse the folders outside of the program to find one you like. For this example I&#39;m going to load [u]Grassland01[/u]. [b]Note: You don&#39;t need to select any specific tile or anything, just select the [i]folder[/i] and it will load all of the tiles inside.[/b][/li]
[li]You may have to click on the new tab that appears to see the loaded tiles, but when you do, it should look like this:
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/AoKrE.png[/img][/li][/ol]



If you&#39;ve made a tile based map before (example - RPG Maker), you may notice I don&#39;t have a way to edit tile properties, like &#39;blocking&#39; or effects. Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;re doing this a different way (not in the map format). 

[size=14pt]If you&#39;ve never made a map before, here are a few tips:[/size]

[ul][li]Layers are your friends! Use the first layer (0) for the ground/floor. Use the second layer for objects that are on top of the ground (flowers, trees, etc. Use the third layer for whole map lighting effects (like the second tile in the first column of the grassy tile set) [u][b]OR[/b][/u] objects on top of objects. (You can see the layer you are on by hovering over the map, the Z coordinate is your layer)[/li]
[li]You can change whether or not tiles from other layers than the one you have selected are visible, just go to [i]View -&gt; Show Inactive Layers[/i]. If you want to be able to view other layers but still be able to tell the difference between them, select [i]View -&gt; Inactive Layer Overlay[/i][/li]
[li]If the grid is in your way, you can turn it off in the View menu![/li]
[li]You [u]can[/u] use tiles from more than one folder to make a map, just use what looks good![/li]
[li]If you&#39;re doing the inside of buildings, you don&#39;t need to use the entire map area. You can just have the rest be black![/li][/ul]

If you have more tips I can add here, questions, or features I should add to the editor, just post!

[size=14pt]Using the editor:[/size]
Using the editor is a lot like paint, a lot of the features even look the same, except when erasing, you can basically use &#39;bucket erase&#39; by right clicking on a tile instead of normally clicking.
All contributors whose maps are used will be given credit when the RPG is released.

<p>Throw that on a 1024x1024 map and it clocks in around 50MB uncompressed, with a large amount of it just being 0’s, or with large areas of the same tile type etc, so it compressed a lot.</p>

I would advise adding some sort of compression. When I was playing around with my newer map format, larger maps would easily get up around the 50MB mark uncompressed, down to ~1MB when compressed, makes a difference.<br>

<p>I removed dynamic map sizes and rotation because I didn’t need them for what I was using it for and because it wouldn’t work properly for my map format/loading I was using for my game. I will probably re-add dynamic map sizes though, because now that this is a public tool instead of my game probably will want it. Not rotation though, that would either require people just making new tiles with the rotated image, or adding that information into the map format, which right now is relatively small (without compression or any sort of data shrinking system)</p>

Can we rotate imported sprites?<br>
[/quote]No. However you can rotate them using any image manipulator before/after creating the map. This has no image manipulation though.[/quote]</p>
<p>Tsk tsk tsk.<br>
It did have rotation.</p>

              <p>This is a one size (currently) tile based map editor, with a nice tile set included.<br>
Ill you need to do is download my <a href="http://davidscape.org/MapEditor.zip" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">map editor</a> (thanks to Budda for the GUI skeleton!) and get drawing!</p>
<p>How to use the map editor:</p>
<p>[ol][li]Extract the folder[/li]<br>
[li]If on a windows pc, you should be able to just double click on the jar and run it. If that doesn’t work or you are on a unix system, cd to where you extracted the folder and use [tt]java -jar MapEditor.jar[/tt][/li]<br>
[li]Click New Map. The main editor GUI will now pop up:<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i.imgur.com/JfbdW.png" title="JfbdW.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JfbdW.png" alt width="642" height="500"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">JfbdW.png</span><span class="informations">891×693</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div>[/li]<br>
[li]Obviously we don’t want an entire black map! To load a tile set, go to <span class="bbcode-i">File - Load Tile Folder</span>. It should automatically load into the ‘title’ directory of the data folder, if it doesn’t, navigate there. Select a folder that you want to load. You can browse the folders outside of the program to find one you like. For this example I’m going to load <span class="bbcode-u">Grassland01</span>. <span class="bbcode-b">Note: You don’t need to select any specific tile or anything, just select the <span class="bbcode-i">folder</span> and it will load all of the tiles inside.</span>[/li]<br>
[li]You may have to click on the new tab that appears to see the loaded tiles, but when you do, it should look like this:<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i.imgur.com/AoKrE.png" title="AoKrE.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/AoKrE.png" alt width="273" height="500"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">AoKrE.png</span><span class="informations">273×644</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div>[/li][/ol]</p>
<p>If you’ve made a tile based map before (example - RPG Maker), you may notice I don’t have a way to edit tile properties, like ‘blocking’ or effects. Don’t worry, we’re doing this a different way (not in the map format).</p>
<p>[size=14pt]If you’ve never made a map before, here are a few tips:[/size]</p>
<p>[ul][li]Layers are your friends! Use the first layer (0) for the ground/floor. Use the second layer for objects that are on top of the ground (flowers, trees, etc. Use the third layer for whole map lighting effects (like the second tile in the first column of the grassy tile set) <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">OR</span></span> objects on top of objects. (You can see the layer you are on by hovering over the map, the Z coordinate is your layer)[/li]<br>
[li]You can change whether or not tiles from other layers than the one you have selected are visible, just go to <span class="bbcode-i">View -&gt; Show Inactive Layers</span>. If you want to be able to view other layers but still be able to tell the difference between them, select <span class="bbcode-i">View -&gt; Inactive Layer Overlay</span>[/li]<br>
[li]If the grid is in your way, you can turn it off in the View menu![/li]<br>
[li]You <span class="bbcode-u">can</span> use tiles from more than one folder to make a map, just use what looks good![/li]<br>
[li]If you’re doing the inside of buildings, you don’t need to use the entire map area. You can just have the rest be black![/li][/ul]</p>
<p>If you have more tips I can add here, questions, or features I should add to the editor, just post!</p>
<p>[size=14pt]Using the editor:[/size]<br>
Using the editor is a lot like paint, a lot of the features even look the same, except when erasing, you can basically use ‘bucket erase’ by right clicking on a tile instead of normally clicking.<br>
All contributors whose maps are used will be given credit when the RPG is released.</p>
