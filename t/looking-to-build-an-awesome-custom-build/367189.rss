    <title>Looking to build an awesome custom build</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-to-build-an-awesome-custom-build/367189</link>
    <description>What do you think of these?
I think I&#39;ve come to a pretty good price for the lot, though I still need a case, CD drive, and probably some aftermarket coolers.

I&#39;d be using it for 3d rendering, and lots of hardcore gaming. ;) 
Ideally my budget would be about £1000.


Intel Core i7-950 Bloomfield 3.06GHz 4 x 256KB L2 Cache 8MB L3 Cache LGA 1366 130W Quad-Core Processor
[url=http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115211&amp;cm_re=i7_950-_-19-115-211-_-Product]http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115211&amp;cm_re=i7_950-_-19-115-211-_-Product[/url]
£185


Asus 1280Mb nVidia GeForce GTX 470 PCI-Express VGA Card
[url=http://www.eclipsecomputers.com/product.aspx?code=GCA-XNGTX4712]http://www.eclipsecomputers.com/product.aspx?code=GCA-XNGTX4712[/url]
£191.82 inc.VAT


1TB Hitachi 7K1000.C 7200rpm 16Mb SATA II Hard Drive
[url=http://www.eclipsecomputers.com/product.aspx?code=HDH-10007K1B]http://www.eclipsecomputers.com/product.aspx?code=HDH-10007K1B[/url]
£38.72 inc.VAT
(Could also buy additional if needed, but I&#39;d probably keep a lot of stuff on my external)


Corsair XMS3 6GB (3x2GB) DDR3 PC3-10666C9 1333MHz Triple Channel
[url=http://www.overclockers.co.uk/showproduct.php?prodid=MY-265-CS&amp;utm_source=froogle]http://www.overclockers.co.uk/showproduct.php?prodid=MY-265-CS&amp;utm_source=froogle[/url]
£105

ASUS P6TD Deluxe LGA 1366 Intel X58 ATX Intel Motherboard
[url=http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131403]http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131403[/url]
£150



Anything else I could get that&#39;s better, but not a huge amount of money more?
Oh and could someone recommend a case that would fit all of this in?  Cheers.</description>

personally i’d advise getting to know about your hardware first, it really does make it a lot easier give us a pm if you need any help i’ll see what i can do but go ahead and do some research on different things and learn about the different options you have available, what they do, how they work and so on</p>

<p>Hahaha I’m loving this.</p>
<p>Tell me more about my personality!  You seemed to have gathered quite a bit about me from just 13 posts.  That’s impressive.  Haha, where will I be in 10 years?</p>
<p>For the record, in case SilentCJ is still reading this, I don’t want to mislead you.  Intel does not <em>support</em> 1600 MHz RAM for Core i7 processors in any sense of the word, see the link I provided.  I didn’t say it was impossible, please reread if necessary; SilentCJ himself said he wasn’t overclocking, which makes your debate of a moot point even more irrelevant.</p>
<p>You amuse me.  By all means, keep it coming.[/quote]</p>
<p>Wow, hilarious. You still fail to see that I was trying to help us not get into this yet I failed to anticipate that you would actually want us to derail someone’s thread into a series of flames and nonsensical arguments (apologies SilenctCJ). I don’t need to pretend I know lots about your personality, it shone right on through, and apparently with this latest addition to your posts it’s not like I was wrong.</p>
<p>You never previously mentioned intel and what they support, you never said it “wasn’t impossible” either, instead you did a damn good job of implying it couldn’t be done. You’re just trying to continue a personal dispute from over two years ago, for “personal amusement” so it seems.</p>
<p>Do you think that annoys me xxlegitxx? Do you think I spent the last two years hoping you’d never come back?<br>
Maybe I’m scared of you, and maybe you wind me up so much I just wont be able to take it any more. All I can ever think about is you, it’s not like I forgot about you or anything. This forum is my life and my arch enemy xxlegitxx finally came back whooopeee.</p>
<p>The really, reeeeaaalllly funny thing is. I don’t care, never had - I’ve argued and flamed with my fair share of individuals on the internet. In my head, I don’t rank or rate or remember these people - I see them as a large pile of nothing, vacant space. Just like you.</p>
<p>I’m going to throw an image in to brighten up this miserable post.<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Ak4IudzYh98/SwuKpDDi_NI/AAAAAAAAAow/YmWneOaEB70/s1600/d2ad35670d3ac0_full.jpg" title="d2ad35670d3ac0_full.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Ak4IudzYh98/SwuKpDDi_NI/AAAAAAAAAow/YmWneOaEB70/s1600/d2ad35670d3ac0_full.jpg" alt width="400" height="500"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">d2ad35670d3ac0_full.jpg</span><span class="informations">512×640</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">SilentCJ</span> - I shouldn’t have to tell you - don’t listen to the guy who’s only trying to advise you against what we say because he has pathetic vendettas. Anyone pedantic enough to tell you that bullshit about “intel” not supporting it after it becomes blatantly obvious you can (and safely) is no good advisor. His first post, first line; “Right off the bat, are you sure your processor supports that RAM speed?” - He didn’t even know for sure himself and I can tell you now, anyone who dismisses telling you the truth because you weren’t going to overclock is a bad teacher. Especially after what you said about it possibly blowing up. This just indicates you’re uneducated on the subject, which is fair enough. What we do now is rather than claim you shouldn’t be overclocking like xxlegitxx, we educate you on how to. That way it’s your choice and you’ve learned something.</p>
<p>It’s really really easy, and there’s fantastic guides on overclocking forums and plenty of blogs. If you need a hand give me or Thug-Life a shout (TL, will know more about i7s than me- I’m sure he’ll point you in the right direction). On the other hand you could keep it all at stock settings for a few months and if you want more speed make the changes then.</p>

<p>Who said anything about careless?</p>
<p>Haha I love just getting you and Greeny riled up.  It’s as easy as it was 2 years ago.[/quote]</p>
<p>Riled up? How did you rile us up? The major annoyance of you two years ago was your inability to accept defeat, even when you were wrong. Like right now, you trying to put a spin on your lack of knowledge as if it was purposeful. Pathetic, I feel like I’m wasting my time saying this as I know perfectly well where it is going. I suggest you crawl back into your hole now before embarrassing yourself further. Thug-life and myself would deeply appreciate it, since we’re just getting all “riled” up.</p>
<p>PS. I called you “careless” … giving you the benefit of the doubt. Instead you wanted to play it like this. I actually thought you’d returned mature after reading your Guitar thread.</p>

              <p>i’m with Thug-life, once you get an SSD you’ll never go without one. My 30gb OCZ Vertex has lasted me a year and now im upgrading to a 120gb pheonix pro with the sandforce controller, nearly double the speed and quad the capacity. Usually can only fit my os and some apps on, but now ill fit all the shit i use (games too)</p>
<p>i’m also using 1600mhz ram, combined with an SSD you never really ever feel like you gotta wait for things. windows is just too snappy, if you took the ssd out after a few hours you’d feel like somethings wrong with your computer.</p>
<p>don’t take my wordl, try it for your self. they say it’s the best upgrade you can do to a computer these days once your specs are all decent.</p>

<p>By the way, have you considered not getting the i7-950.

<p>More than likely, but it’s not a bad thing unless your memory can’t handle it since OCing both the RAM and CPU is the best way to see speed improvements.</p>
<p>Well, I just did some searching and the 920 is still a highly recommended CPU around overclocking communities, people OCing up to and beyond what I was predicting - baring in mind your cooling system will probably be one of the most limiting factors. There’s plenty of OC guides out there so I really just recommend searching around seeing what’s similar to your spec and going from there.</p>
<p>Never play without knowing what you’re doing though, it’s not too hard to accidentally damage components permanently. Always small voltage increases at first, and don’t forget to stress test.[/quote]</p>
<p>As said earlier, I am really worried about the whole thing just going up in flames <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> , I’ll be sure to do a hell of a lot of research into to it before I finally start it up for the first time.</p>
<p>Yes I did consider it, I first started looking at the i7 850, then found out I can get the i7 920 for not a great deal more, and then I looked up from there and saw the i7 950 which is practically the same price.  Silly me thinking that higher numbers are always better. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
My mate has his computer cooled with over 10 fans, 11 I think, surely if I just did that, got a shittonne of fans, it’s bound to not overheat?  Providing I put them in the right place of course.</p>
<p>Fans are one of the only pieces of hardware which I’ve never fiddled with, I’ve had 2 laptops and a desktop, of which I did some very minor building on, but never had to configure any fans due to it being a fairly low spec machine.</p>

I’ve got a i7 920 here, OCed to 3.4 ghz so it runs at ddr-1333 speeds, but if I go higher, won’t my ram be forced to go faster?[/quote]</p>
<p>More than likely, but it’s not a bad thing unless your memory can’t handle it since OCing both the RAM and CPU is the best way to see speed improvements.</p>
<p>Well, I just did some searching and the 920 is still a highly recommended CPU around overclocking communities, people OCing up to and beyond what I was predicting - baring in mind your cooling system will probably be one of the most limiting factors. There’s plenty of OC guides out there so I really just recommend searching around seeing what’s similar to your spec and going from there.</p>
<p>Never play without knowing what you’re doing though, it’s not too hard to accidentally damage components permanently. Always small voltage increases at first, and don’t forget to stress test.</p>

<p>By the way, have you considered not getting the i7-950. It’s good but unless you’re going to  watercool it and try to OC it up to about 5Ghz or something it’s pretty pointless since the i7-920 will OC up to 4Ghz without a problem at all (probs 4.3/4.4 if you have good cooling). It’s mainly because the i7-950 is pretty much an i7-920 but labeled at an average higher non-overclocked speed. Make sure to get the D0 stepping models over C0 though, they generally will run faster at lower temps/voltages than the alternative.</p>

<p>Hey that’s fine. You were looking to build an “an awesome custom build” so people were just showing you where the serious hardware was at. Best bet is to choose a budget, and then you can build the optimum machine from there without being shown a load of overpriced stuff you can’t currently afford ;).</p>
<p>By the way, have you considered not getting the i7-950. It’s good but unless you’re going to  watercool it and try to OC it up to about 5Ghz or something it’s pretty pointless since the i7-920 will OC up to 4Ghz without a problem at all (probs 4.3/4.4 if you have good cooling).

I call it careless, because you were wrong in the first place and also because your comment was immature (which is ironic as the comment was “grow up”).<br>
