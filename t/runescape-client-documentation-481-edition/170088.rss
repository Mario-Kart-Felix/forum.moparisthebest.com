    <description>Welcome to Runescape Client Documentation, 481 Edition.

Although there is no substitute for static analysis, I have found what seem to be some useful static integer fields using dynamic analysis with RuneGrail while testing. Each of the fields below was obtained by taking a random class and sampling all of the static int variables until a fairly consistent result was found. If you ever decide to search for patterns and incorporate any of these into an updater feel free to do so. Some of them are probably new, while others are more than likely old. I&#39;ll try to make this a living thread until client 481 is updated. Remember, these are just guesses at best, but I have found them to be fairly consistent.

Note: The best way to create &quot;links&quot; for different fields in the Runescape client is by examining the source until you understand what is going on, in other words, make yourself into a human updater =)

Name: static int od.T
Description: Reveals the amount of Players currently on screen.

Name: static int od.Z
Description: Keeps track of clicks made upon the client.

Name: static int od.D
Description: Increases indefinitely while the mouse is on an NPC.

Name: static int sh.sb
Description: Keeps track of which inventory slot your mouse is on 0 - 27 and 0 - 437 (I forgot the exact number for the bank.) Works for both player inventory and inventory in the bank.

Name: static int sh.kb
Description: Increments every time anyone in the current field is hit.

Name: static int cb.d
Description: assigns a unique identification for the general land/area you are in.

Name: static int eb.f
Description: Reveals the amount of weight you are carrying.

Name: static int eb.g
Description: Holds the y position of the mouse on your client.</description>

              <p>hehe, i quite agree, releasing a refactored client and/or identification methods would be spoon feeding of epic proportions. if people do not learn things by themselves they will not know how it works and how to later fix things when they get broken. then again, if you wish to have a discussion about the client, if the names aren’t standard you will spend much of your time translating</p>

              <p>frank_, the name you are looking for is:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public interface GameInterfaceRefCacheMediator {
    public GameLinkedListMediator[] getList();
}</code></pre>
<p>I can give whatever excuse I want for why I named it what I named it. The truth is, I simply didn’t see the ‘hashmap’ similarities in this class that others had seen. Structurally, I can see it being named like that. However, I think structure is only half of if. I didn’t notice in the usage of that class very many (if any) locations where direct O(1) lookups were made (It was, after all a long time ago). Every usage I saw dealt with iterating over that <span class="bbcode-i">backing</span> list. To me, that was iterating over referential cached data. The rest of the name came from idiosyncrasies deriving from old habits of an old coder.</p>
<p>But I digress. A naming standard could be useful. I only know of one person to ever completely rename an entire client; wL. He completely renamed 317 down to the local variables. The ‘public server’ frenzy was completely due to the dumbed-down client that he released to the public. He never released his personal client or server. I’ve been renaming a current client using his 317 renamed and from where I stand, his naming conventions are quite informative.</p>
<p>All that being said, I don’t think I could post a list of names without posting a completely renamed client. The names would have to be translated so everyone would understand the related context… and posting the renamed client isn’t going to happen. Why? Because for one, the renamed client is wL’s. He did the work. I am notorious for releasing very little to anyone, I release even less when the <span class="bbcode-i">thing</span> in question doesn’t even belong to me. Furthermore, I think it is very unwise to publicly post the methods you use to properly identify fields/locations/hooks (whatever you want to call them). You are just asking to have them broken.</p>

              <p>I see immense value in creating a legitimate RuneScape emulator (fine, server if you will) for the purposes of client documentation. Starting work over each and every game update is exhausting, and discouraging. However, if we settle on a recent version of RuneScape (the last engine to have a server made for it was 317, and the game has changed significantly since then, also there was no progressive research being done. It was for the shitsngiggles, and it turned out badly), and seriously implement a pragmatic server engine, there’s no end to the work we can get done until it’s finished. Thoughts?</p>

              <pre><code>frank_, You told me that on IRC and I agree with you, and yakman basically told me the same thing. [b]But wouldn't it cut down on development time to trace classes of interest and then traverse the client's code if you like what you see?...try before you buy?[/b] Yakman pretty much told me that this is a moot point considering the fact that anything that is crucial to the bot development process has already been "hooked" and it's really just a matter of building a solid foundation for finding those "hooks" again in your updater. 

If that's the case, then I'm doomed to an existence of finding useless and at best exotic/interesting fields within the client. frank_ you said yourself that virtually [i]99% of the client is unknown[/i] and until I learn extremely well how 3D graphics programming is done, I don't really see my contributing anything to lowering that percentage. For instance, shangtsung1 posted those CameraX and CameraY fields which you can probably find in any updater log. But taking a look at how that works on the client, I was dumbfounded as to what they measured specifically. Walking around the world I noticed that it increases in the x-direction for the x and y-direction for the y, but it starts out at an insanely large number and resets itself once a loading please wait occurs (among other seeming quirks.) 

Something like the above would definitely need some code tracing because it's impossible to tell what's going on mathematically in relation to the client, I don't believe I would understand what the purpose of it was any old way unless I got a basic foundation in the world of 3D programming (I'm in the process of rectifying that situation though.) But for things like player weight, it's almost unmistakable if you see the field in question working in action. Updater outputs seem to be abysmally small from what I've seen (In relation to what I believe they can be) and fairly repetitive, and that's probably because an extremely large amount of time has been invested into finding them in the first place and it would be a pain to go back in the Runescape client and _find_ new things to "hook."
</code></pre>
<p>I’d love if someone would explain how CameraX, CameraY (shouldn’t there be a Z?) work and how people use them in bots…</p>
