    <description>A final project of mine. I actually like it, and will probably use it from now on to tag my videos at the very end.

The current version on there now is still lo-res. When it&#39;s completely finished processing it&#39;ll be HD.

              <p>Needs more variation in the sound of the letter’s hitting the glass. It takes too long for us too see your name, and it’s only there for a brief second. I would suggest making more than one letter hit the glass at a time, to speed it up. Also, do you plan on changing the background? I wouldn’t leave it as that aquamarine color.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, the top and bottom of the tornado are missing, maybe use the camera to hide that? There’s a part near the beginning when the tornado is moving from the right side, where it seems to skip a frame. I’m assuming that was where the tornado was going forwarding, and then swinging back into place. I’m sure it was on purpose, but the frame skip looked odd.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if this is the finished product or not, if it isn’t then forgive me, I’m sure you noticed these things.</p>
