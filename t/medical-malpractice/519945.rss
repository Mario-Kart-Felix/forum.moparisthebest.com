    <title>Medical malpractice</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/medical-malpractice/519945</link>
    <description>So my girlfriend of 3 months has epilepsy.  She has a history of horrible seizures, and now takes medicine for it twice a day to stop it, but still has seizures every 1-3 months.  She has a scar on her right forehead in her brain.  Whenever she&#39;s off the medicine for more than 8 hours, she will have seizures and it&#39;s happened before.  So three weeks ago, her regular doctor (who is aware of her history) decided to do some neurological tests by triggering her seizures and watching her brain activity.  They told my girlfriend to stop taking her medicine sunday morning and night, and go to see the doctor the next day at 1 p.m. for the tests.  Last sunday she got off her medicine and at around 8:22 she had a seizure.  In around thirty minutes, she had around 4-5 seizures in my car on the way to the hospital, so we had to call an ambulance to get her.  They took her to the nearest hospital.  She was having nonstop and long seizures from 9:30 to around 11 pm.  Monday morning she had more seizures, so they transferred her to ICU and put her in an induced coma until wednesday to try to wake her up, which worked for a bit until she had a seizure after being awake for a couple hours.  She is sleeping now and they are doing tests today throughout the day.

My manager at my work told me that they could sue the other doctor who told her to get off her medicine for malpractice.  I&#39;m just asking if it would go far in this case..? Is it worth it too?  And if you could expand on what would happen as well if we did.  If anybody knows anything about it, please let me know.</description>

              <p>There’s malpractice, and then there’s something we medical-wiz’s call <span class="bbcode-i">medical negligence</span> which is also very sue worthy. It’s basically when the doctor knows the dangers of a situation but ignores it. In your case it could fall under this since your doctor knew she would have seizures but clearly didn’t know it would be that severe.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Medical malpractice is usually the case when a patient is unexpectedly injured, usually as the result of a medical error. If your girlfriends doctor wanted to perform medical tests which required her to stop taking her epilepsy medication (with the KNOWN outcome of having epileptic fits) then it seems to me a valid medical procedure.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not you think it is medical malpractice, <span class="bbcode-b">you should immediately get a second opinion from a different doctor</span>. If you do not then you may shoot yourself in the foot when you do want to sue for medical malpractice, if it can even be considered so.</p>
