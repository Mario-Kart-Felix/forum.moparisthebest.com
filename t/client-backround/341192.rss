              <p>WELL first off, search your source and find the previous client backround, sometimes its in the sprites but your gonna have to do a bit of searching. next, find the picture you want, say u want one from Rs website, right click the picture and copy it. next go into your client folder and find the picture. next, “open with” paint. the backround you want to change should be on the screen. like i said, cop the picture you want and paste it over the picture and resize it to fit the client picture. use the prviouse picture size to help you measure. so it’s basicly just your picture covering the old one. save, compile the client and try it xD hope it helped.</p>
<p>Oh and if you wish to edit the picture, simply just edit it with paint, <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> good luck!!</p>
