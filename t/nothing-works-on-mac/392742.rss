    <title>Nothing. . . Works. . . On. . . MAC!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/nothing-works-on-mac/392742</link>
    <description>Well now I’ve been checking out private servers for about two months now and Im pretty sure that any day now Im gonna lose my mind.  You see I have a Mac and soon after buying it I realized that nobody feels mac is important enough to make anything for but anyway, even the things that are supposed to work for mac don’t work.  I’ve checked out 
1. Battlescape
2. Moparscape
3. SiggiScape
4. Mac - Scape

After trying different, already made servers, I tried making them.  One problem I ran into was all the compilers were batch files and mac gets confused with those. 
So heres what I’m asking:  is there anyway somebody could find some awesome server (webclient hopefully) that actually works for mac or help me make an awesome server that does.BTW, Im looking for a server with particular emphasis on gaining levels quickly.</description>

<p>You sir, are an idiot.</p>
<ol>
<li>Batch files are windows specific.</li>
<li>Java is cross platform. Most Macs come with Java shipped.</li>
<li>All you need to do, is open Terminal, cd to the directory where your server files are, then java path/to/main/class</li>
</ol>
