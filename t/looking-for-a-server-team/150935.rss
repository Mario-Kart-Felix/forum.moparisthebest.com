    <description>[center]Hey im Will
im looking for a coding team for my latest addition for &#39;Epsonation&#39;

my last server had been building up tonnes of lag and crashing my server. so i decided to use a completly new source and start over, ive lready done alot to it but looking for some more help so that i can bring a completly awsome server together.

Alot of upgrades so far:
Full range with projectiles, also fully working crystal bow and animations.
Full working mage on npc&#39;s (not yet fixed on npc&#39;s)
Working on full pickpocketing at the moment.
starts in west ardy.
full hits like real runescape. 
Monsters/npc&#39;s attack you back with the right animations!
some good training spots! (adding more tele commands to make easier.
some good shops, (adding new silabs to some of them)

The aim for my right now is to make a custom server but along with the feel of moparscape. so it wont be as hard as runescape but will have most things like it for example, npc&#39;s blocks and attack animations. full range mage and melee etc.

anyways im going to need the following people to fill these spots. the coders that are joining me will have their unique name on my server for example &quot;mod (name)&quot;  etc.    congratulations on the following people.

Coder #1: 
Coder #2:
Code compiler (puts codes together):
Assistant owner:   Java_Coffee™

Add my msn if you want to join, this will be my msn for all server discussions etc.
