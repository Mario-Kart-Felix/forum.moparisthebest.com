    <title>Help needed (errors)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-needed-errors/448475</link>
    <description>     i&#39;ve been trying to make a server in hopes to learn how to code. I&#39;ve tried a few different sources and none seem to work. i figured out part of my error was that i needed to change the file destination in the runserver.bat to fit my current version of Java. however, this did not fix my problem entirely. The first one, Jagex-scape (might as well give credit to the original owner) doesn&#39;t really give me errors but when i run the client it can&#39;t connect which makes me think something&#39;s wrong.

one last thing (not related to the topic in any way) anyone have any tips for learning how to code a 562 rsps? I&#39;m hoping to eventually open my own server.


Thanks, any help will be greatly appreciated.</description>
