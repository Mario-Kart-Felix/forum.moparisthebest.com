    <title>{PI} Public Void Problem {PI}</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-public-void-problem-pi/402794</link>
    <description>Ok I&#39;ve been trying to fix this myself for about 2 days now and no matter what I do it doesn&#39;t work. When I compile it says, &quot;src/server/model/players/packets/commands.java:740: illegal start of expression 

   public void moderatorcommands(Client c, String playerCommand)
   ^


Ok so all these commands have been put in a text document attached to this post. I added them into the document because I cannot post them here due to the maximum of 20000 characters limit.

So please help because I cannot update anything until this gets fixed and I am an intermediate coder and what I am thinking is that it is not recognizing the public void because of a code error above it but I could be wrong. It does not seem as there is a coding error above it but it could be. It did not show up on the compiler but there&#39;s always a chance. Anyways I would appreciate the help.</description>
