    <description>Hello everybody reading this... I&#39;m a semi-new member to this community (This is a new account) and I&#39;m really interested in learning a lot about how the coding is actually written from scratch.. to be honest prior to this i was just dling sources and editing small things of course like moving teleports.. texts.. all that noob stuff ect... but I&#39;m looking for someone who would be able to spend some time and teach me how to write simple programs and how to incorporate what I know into writing my own RSPS framework and that sort of stuff...

Thank you, any help is much appreciated...
