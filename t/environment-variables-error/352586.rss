    <description>Ok im new to making servers so sorry for me being stupid


i just did my portforwarding and set up my no.ip.biz
when i go under 
 Environment Variables firstly theres no class path file, and in the path file theres what the original statement [system32 etc] under the tut &quot;how to start a server&quot; [top of this thred index page] it gave 2 values you have to place in there.

I made a &quot;Classpath&quot; folder and pasted the what it said should be in there into it, and i deleted what the &quot;Path&quot; files value was and replaced it with what its on the tut, when i did ipconfig, i keep geting that its not recognized as an internal.external command 

i serched the comments to see if anyone was having that problem and someone was, and someone said to try doing &quot;ipconfig/all&quot; tired that and still got nothing, i enterd &quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_11\bin;&quot; into it i have &quot;jdk-6u21-windows-i586&quot;


can someone tell me the values i can place into the path file and the classpath files so that i can get my server online?

oh and i was following some really old server guide and i have another old server compiled in the jdk folder how can i remove that and is that whats causing this problem? 


also i made a no.ip.biz can you also explain how that works aswell?</description>
