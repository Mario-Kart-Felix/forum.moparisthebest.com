    <title>How do you make an NPC do an emote?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-you-make-an-npc-do-an-emote/41165</link>
    <description>Hello, I am Zirak it is nice to meet you.
But can you help me on a problem... Seems like I can&#39;t find a way yet to make an npc do an emote...
So can some one help me figure it out? or Just tell me how to do it?
If you decide to Keep it private then that is ok too... If i make any tutorial on it or something about it i will always
give credits to who helped me on this. So please Help thank you!
