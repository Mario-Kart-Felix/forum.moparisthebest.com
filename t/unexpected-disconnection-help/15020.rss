    <title>Unexpected disconnection!? HELP!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unexpected-disconnection-help/15020</link>
    <description>There is no error, but instead, it sometimes disconnects all the player on the server, making it look like this...


[code]Game saved for player1
Client Handler: Disconnected player1
Game saved for player2
Client Handler: Disconnected player2
Game saved for player3
Client Handler: Disconnected player3
Game saved for player4
Client Handler: Disconnected player4
Game saved for player5
Client Handler: Disconnected player5
Game saved for player6
Client Handler: Disconnected player6
Game saved for player7
Client Handler: Disconnected player7
[/code]

And some people wouldnt be able to go back on.
