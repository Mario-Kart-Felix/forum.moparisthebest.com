    <title>Stuck at &quot;Checking for updates - 1%&quot; on 718 Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stuck-at-checking-for-updates-1-on-718-client/507443</link>
    <description>I am hosting the server on a VPS and have I have the VPS ip and port put in Loader.java on the client. The server runs fine (I&#39;m using PowerSurge 742) but the client just stays at &quot;Checking for updates - 1%&quot;. Is there a place where I am supposed to put a cache.zip www link? If there is where is it? And can I just use an uppit link for it?

Any help would be greatly appreciated and will be rep++ worthy.</description>

<p>Ok well I will use dropbox, but I have literally looked for where to put the link in every class, with no luck. Any idea where to go from here?</p>
<p>My server loads the cache from data/cache, and runs smoothly…</p>

              <p>I’m not sure what file the cache link to the cache goes in, as I’m not really familiar with that revision at all, but I doubt you could use an uppit link. It’d be best if you had a direct-download link.</p>
