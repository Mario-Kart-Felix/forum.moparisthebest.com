    <title>Best way to get familiarized with C# and 3D Game Programming? (Discussion)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/best-way-to-get-familiarized-with-c-and-3d-game-programming-discussion/465843</link>
    <description>Hey so I&#39;ve been wanting to learn some C#, but more importantly, game programming. I know you can do game programming in various different languages, but I&#39;ve chosen C#. I want to know possibly what some good resources are, what the best game engines are, and the best programs for 3D Modeling. I&#39;ve started some with using MilkShape 3D for 3D Modeling, and I&#39;ve been working with the Torque game engine, being a programmer before-hand I already have Notepad++ and I&#39;ve looked into UltraEdit32.

I have some base knowledge from a book I&#39;ve been looking at called [i][u]3D Game Programming All In One[/u][/i] by Kenneth C. Finney, any other suggestions for books, any C# programming resources, or recommendations for game engines and programs let me know, will be greatly appreciated. -TWG

Edit:
Before anyone jumps in and says something about this, I understand that there is a difference between C, C#, and C++, the reasoning behind me choosing C# is because it&#39;s probably the closest that resembles Java, and it is usually used for web-based applications, so I&#39;ve understood.</description>

lin would say use XNA<br>
[/quote]You can use regular C# and XNA and have a 360/PC game, or you can use Mono and Mono XNA and have a PC game that runs on Mac, Linux, and Windows. XNA is okay, but I have problems with how high-leveled it is.[/quote]</p>
