Sure, but most of those games are made by big companies.  As an independent dev you have almost no chance at cracking the top 25 with a game.  Creating some kind of utility or tool brings in easier profits.</p>
<p>I have easily cracked high profits daily - not $3000+ a day as in top 25, but decent daily profits by making some kind of utilities/tools.</p>
