    <description>I remember playing this game a long time ago, I didn&#39;t own it but this was in the time I use to rent games out for a week or so and save up on monthly vouches. Just making this topic because I&#39;m am about to download it and play for the first time since PS2, woo!

BIG deal? Yeah it&#39;s a big deal, its a game of its own kind. Basically you&#39;re a shark and you do shark things, eat and that is literally about it but it&#39;s somehow fun. You eat smaller sharks, people, boats etc.

Anyone else played it before? Surely you have.</description>

              <p>I played it on the original xbox console. As a young boy I loved the game, if I played it now I would probably quit after eating the first person. Overall boring game. imo.</p>
