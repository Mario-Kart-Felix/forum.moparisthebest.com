    <description>[b][size=18pt]Project Vildar[/size][/b]

[b]What is Jbirdscape?[/b]
Jbirdscape was a very old server created in 2006 which had taught me all of my programming languages by trial &amp; error. Eventually i started to take little lessons and search for my error fixes and explored even more, back on topic. It was a known server by old community members of moparscape and other forums.

[b]What makes Vildar better/different?[/b]
Vildar&#39;s name came from a random name chooser which was used for a WoW Private Server i was working on, eventually quit because i didnt like how the whole editting thing was put together. So i bought things for vildar including domain name, so i kept the name. Vildar is going to better in plenty of ways; advertising a lot more, organizing a well put together community, no source changes, glitch bug leaks will be handled in manor and correctly, this server will have player voted updates, and the server has a lot more to offer.

[b]Why create a development team?[/b]
I want to create a development team to make this server progress much quicker as i havent had much dedication or motivation to finishing this project. It is a here and there work ethic, i need some people to give me some motive by just being there wanting the project done and organizing a bunch of great plans and ideas for the servers development. I do not want you to become part of my development team to be immature or childish and play games, being in a development team means work. This team will have a few main people in it. Your job will be decided on what you can do. No, I do not need programmers.

[b]What is expected of you in the development team?[/b]
I expect for you to be active. If you can not be active for reasons like hanging out with your girlfriend or sports and other activities then thats your business. Its obvious you cant be active. A lot of times i get insulted and people who feel insulted from being demoted. Being demoted isnt an insult here at Project Vildar. If you cant handle the position because of irl situations then thats okay, nothing against you or your actions. Life is first, obviously. Now you are expected to post on the forums actively, help when asked. Not playing other games instead of helping your server. Not doing meaningless laziness tasks. I mean business, you should know whats expected of you if you are this far in RSPS that you wish to join a servers development team.

[b]Contacting[/b]
I will be PMing you via forums if i like your app and wish for you to join. More than likely you will receive a PM about your app and how things went. My most preferred messenger or contact program is currently Skype, however MSN is not out the question. MSN is also always open for me. So either way both is good for contacting for me. If you wish to contact me and talk more about this please add me on either MSN (jcrane164@hotmail.com) or Skype (jbirdscape).

Im sorry for getting off topic in a few subject in the above, if i did.
