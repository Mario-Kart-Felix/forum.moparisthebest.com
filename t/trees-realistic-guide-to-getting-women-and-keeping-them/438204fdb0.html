<p>Looks don’t matter. You’re all good you greasy haired, trackie wearing slimeball. Just kidding, they matter. They matter a lot. They initiate attraction a lot of the time. Luckily enough, looks don’t matter as much as they do for a female. They actually value confidence just as much as looks, so don’t stress too hard. This doesn’t mean you can’t improve your looks by grooming yourself.</p>
<p>Body Hair</p>
<p>Say farewell. The appeal of body hair was gone after james bond waxed his off. Invest in some of that hair removal cream and smear it all over your chewbacca like chest, belly and back. Don’t bother waxing, it feels like you’re being stabbed in the stomach by a bowling ball. The cream works fine. As for the pubic region, trim with scissors. Do not shave. Nothing worse than a sweaty, itchy ballsack for the days after. Just trim and trust me.</p>
<p>Haircut</p>
<p>You know your local 10 dollar barber you usually go to? Yeah? No more, fuckhead. Go to a proper hair salon with proper hair stylists and get a proper expensive haircut. It’s worth the extra cash. How do you keep track of what’s good hair? Look up club photos in your city. Clubs usually have loads on their website. Or you could ask the hairdresser? Just always avoid blonde tips. This isn’t year 7 mate.</p>
<p>Hair Styling</p>
<p>Throw away the gel. It’s greasy looking and girls don’t dig this. Instead, for for surfy wax. It’s great, holds and looks natural. Anyone who can get their hands on Gatsby online, do so. That shit is perfection. If you’re hair is waxy and your desired style is a little more straighter, then use a bloody hair straightener. It actually looks great if you’ve straightened your hair and then waxed it around a bit, compared to just wax.</p>
<p>This is my favourite tip of all. Hairspray. It holds through wind. It creates the best hairstyles. Use this gift.</p>
<p>Tan</p>
<p>You’re not in twilight and no, chicks don’t like albinos. Invest in a fake tan. They’re cheap, slimming and make you look a lot better. You can also get little spray on bottles or ‘leg airbrush’. Just keep it all dry after application, don’t put too much on the nose and check you’ve applied well in sunlight before properly going out. Inside lighting does no favours.</p>
<p>Fashion</p>
<p>Luckily enough, great places usually have ‘looks books’ online that have the upcoming season’s fashion trends. Use this as a guide. Once again, look around on club photos. They’re a goldmine for trends. Spend a bit of money. If you’re lacking, op shops are all sweet and full of gems.</p>
<p>You want clothes to fit well. If you’re toned, it’s okay to have a reasonably tight shirt. If you struggle with man boobs and a gut, wear a coat or an open t-shirt over what your normal shirt. Make sure they’re all quality however.</p>
<p>Shoes</p>
<p>It’s a proven fact that women look at the face first, the shoes second. So shoes are vital. Spend money on this. Avoid trainer or joggers. Treat yourself. Vans if you’re younger, the slip on fancy shows if mid. No thongs. Always make sure the shoes are clean.</p>
<p>Nails</p>
<p>Just cut them. Ever tried to fingerbang a bird with nails? It’s not enjoyable for her. The toe-nails needs removal too. We’re not gollums twin.</p>
<p>Gym, Diet</p>
<p>You need to cut out the junk food and start eating healthy. Anything below 1500 calories a day will gain you at least a 1kg loss a week. A non-chubby figure increases your looks by far. If you’re already skinny, start working on the muscles. Eat loads of protein and whatnot and improve yourself. There’s countless benefits from working out.</p>
<p>Job</p>
<p>Yes, it matter. If you’re extremely unhappy with your occupation, the only person who’s going to change it is you. Nobody else. Life’s too short not to be doing what you desire. For trying to reach goals. A bad job will slowly eat away at you. If you’re unhappy, change. Seriously. Money isn’t everything.</p>
<p>Drugs and Drink</p>
<p>When out and about, there’s a lot of debate on whether you should drink or not. Any achievements you would say were caused by drinking and your confidence would not improve. However, the benefit of drinking is too good to pass on. Have a few but not too many. Don’t be slurring-your-words-drunk. You want to be attentive but pumped. Even energy drinks could do you well.</p>
<p>As for drugs when getting girls? MDMA helps. Absolutely. Pure gold is produced from your mouth. Everyone has different views and that, you decide.</p>
</blockquote>I wouldn’t call that a small part, but that’s not even my point.
<p>And you may want to look up what putting on a face means. Your entire ‘guide’ revolves around changing the way your act towards females, in a fucking stupid manner. Or at least the majority of it. I’m not talking about the sex part either as I find that irrelevant to ‘finding’ a girl in the first place.</p>
<blockquote>Do you know where being the nice guy gets you? The friend zone. That's all it does. It's a scary thought that everything your mother told you on how to get a girl, is actually the opposite of what gets a girl. Wrap your head around it because majority of what i have to say from here on out, is based on this.  That the nice guy finishes last. I don't know where people got the idea that attraction is fair.</blockquote>You're better off in the friend zone than disrespecting females to try and get a fuckdate. Again, how about you ask a married man if this is what he did to find a wife.
<p>Name of the guide would be accurate as<br>
‘How to get laid’, not ‘how to get women and keep them’.</p>

<p>If you read the guide, you would know that it doesn’t give you that false hope.<br>
[/quote]You’re an idiot. How about you talk to some married men or get married yourself before trying to teach others how to live their romantic lives. I’ve at least talked to some, and none of them put on a face like you’re suggesting. My grandpa has been married for over 60 years, and I think he’d punch you after reading some of your suggestions. My dad has been married for 20, and he started out as friends with my mom for 10 years, until they realized they loved eachother and got married. And I very much doubt his hair style or body hair had much influence.</p>
<p>I’m just going to be arrogant and say that relationships built on physical attraction are doomed to fail much more than those based on personality. Ever wonder why the divorce rates are going up? It’s because of idiots like you that look too much at the body instead of the inside.</p>
<p>/rant</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Did you even bother to read the whole guide? The physical was only a small part of it all. Putting on a face? I’ve addressed this about three times now. Perhaps have a better read of what i’ve said above and what i’ve wrote into the guide. I promote the strengthening of your identity. I’ve encouraged the readers to make opinions, stick to values and set boundaries. I’ve explained why certain things occur. As well as this, i covered the improvement of oneself because a lot of the time the physical side gets judged first. I covered all areas.</p>
<p>I expected criticism from some, simply because it’s easier to backup an incorrect belief than to admit you’re wrong and adopt a new one. The fact that you ignored most of my writing, makes you the idiot.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well, He is suggesting, you shouldn’t write a guide of something you haven’t experienced<br>
Its Like me writing a guide on how to be famous, but yet not even my old friends recognize me[/quote]</p>
<p>As mentioned previously (i find myself saying this way too many times in this thread), this guide helps people to get a girl and then to maintain it. Many times i have mentioned that it all changes once the two individuals become more connected and feelings grow. I didn’t even delve into the complicities of marriage. I think there’s about three times that this has been said in my text.</p>
<blockquote>And you may want to look up what putting on a face means. Your entire 'guide' revolves around changing the way your act towards females, in a fucking stupid manner. Or at least the majority of it. I'm not talking about the sex part either as I find that irrelevant to 'finding' a girl in the first place.</blockquote>
<p>It doesn’t revolve around changing who you are. To me, pretending to be extremely nice and always accommodating the female is lying to yourself. The typical nice guy isn’t honest with his intentions or his needs. As for the quote from the guide, it was only a small part.</p>
<p>I’ve been through all this a few times now. Once again, read. May i also challenge you to try these and then have an opinion.</p>

<p>Looks don’t matter. You’re all good you greasy haired, trackie wearing slimeball. Just kidding, they matter. They matter a lot. They initiate attraction a lot of the time. Luckily enough, looks don’t matter as much as they do for a female. They actually value confidence just as much as looks, so don’t stress too hard. This doesn’t mean you can’t improve your looks by grooming yourself.</p>
<p>Body Hair</p>
<p>Say farewell. The appeal of body hair was gone after james bond waxed his off. Invest in some of that hair removal cream and smear it all over your chewbacca like chest, belly and back. Don’t bother waxing, it feels like you’re being stabbed in the stomach by a bowling ball. The cream works fine. As for the pubic region, trim with scissors. Do not shave. Nothing worse than a sweaty, itchy ballsack for the days after. Just trim and trust me.</p>

<p>You know your local 10 dollar barber you usually go to? Yeah? No more, fuckhead. Go to a proper hair salon with proper hair stylists and get a proper expensive haircut. It’s worth the extra cash. How do you keep track of what’s good hair? Look up club photos in your city. Clubs usually have loads on their website. Or you could ask the hairdresser? Just always avoid blonde tips. This isn’t year 7 mate.</p>
<p>Hair Styling</p>
<p>Throw away the gel. It’s greasy looking and girls don’t dig this. Instead, for for surfy wax. It’s great, holds and looks natural. Anyone who can get their hands on Gatsby online, do so. That shit is perfection. If you’re hair is waxy and your desired style is a little more straighter, then use a bloody hair straightener. It actually looks great if you’ve straightened your hair and then waxed it around a bit, compared to just wax.</p>
<p>This is my favourite tip of all. Hairspray. It holds through wind. It creates the best hairstyles. Use this gift.</p>
<p>Tan</p>

<p>You want clothes to fit well. If you’re toned, it’s okay to have a reasonably tight shirt. If you struggle with man boobs and a gut, wear a coat or an open t-shirt over what your normal shirt. Make sure they’re all quality however.</p>
<p>Shoes</p>
<p>It’s a proven fact that women look at the face first, the shoes second. So shoes are vital. Spend money on this. Avoid trainer or joggers. Treat yourself. Vans if you’re younger, the slip on fancy shows if mid. No thongs. Always make sure the shoes are clean.</p>
<p>Nails</p>
<p>Just cut them. Ever tried to fingerbang a bird with nails? It’s not enjoyable for her. The toe-nails needs removal too. We’re not gollums twin.</p>
<p>Gym, Diet</p>
<p>You need to cut out the junk food and start eating healthy. Anything below 1500 calories a day will gain you at least a 1kg loss a week. A non-chubby figure increases your looks by far. If you’re already skinny, start working on the muscles. Eat loads of protein and whatnot and improve yourself. There’s countless benefits from working out.</p>
<p>Job</p>
<p>Yes, it matter. If you’re extremely unhappy with your occupation, the only person who’s going to change it is you. Nobody else. Life’s too short not to be doing what you desire. For trying to reach goals. A bad job will slowly eat away at you. If you’re unhappy, change. Seriously. Money isn’t everything.</p>
<p>Drugs and Drink</p>
<p>When out and about, there’s a lot of debate on whether you should drink or not. Any achievements you would say were caused by drinking and your confidence would not improve. However, the benefit of drinking is too good to pass on. Have a few but not too many. Don’t be slurring-your-words-drunk. You want to be attentive but pumped. Even energy drinks could do you well.</p>
<p>As for drugs when getting girls? MDMA helps. Absolutely. Pure gold is produced from your mouth. Everyone has different views and that, you decide.[/quote]I wouldn’t call that a small part, but that’s not even my point.</p>
<p>And you may want to look up what putting on a face means. Your entire ‘guide’ revolves around changing the way your act towards females, in a fucking stupid manner. Or at least the majority of it. I’m not talking about the sex part either as I find that irrelevant to ‘finding’ a girl in the first place.</p>
<p>[quote]Do you know where being the nice guy gets you? The friend zone. That’s all it does. It’s a scary thought that everything your mother told you on how to get a girl, is actually the opposite of what gets a girl. Wrap your head around it because majority of what i have to say from here on out, is based on this.  That the nice guy finishes last. I don’t know where people got the idea that attraction is fair.[/quote]You’re better off in the friend zone than disrespecting females to try and get a fuckdate. Again, how about you ask a married man if this is what he did to find a wife.</p>
<p>Name of the guide would be accurate as<br>
‘How to get laid’, not ‘how to get women and keep them’.[/quote]’</p>

<p>Well actually, it’s a very small peak at what my book is about. I plan to release it by December this year, as well as a blog that covers everything that i mentioned in the guide. In more detail of course. Anyway, i’ve addressed all the opposition to this a few times in both the guide and my responses, so i’ll leave it at that.</p>

<p>Yes, and it has some good points, however you rarely talk about any other type of woman in the guide besides the ones that hang out at clubs, etc etc.  The guide can be worth reading, however in it you, referring to Taharok again, generalize woman as if they’re all the same.  I also see consistent references to sex in almost all parts of the guide.  This should be more like “Tree’s guide to getting fucked”, mostly because that’s all I see happening here.</p>
<p>This is good on changing your way of thinking and keeping your viewpoints even though a “relationship”, however it won’t help you pick up any woman (besides the weird shallow ones).</p>
