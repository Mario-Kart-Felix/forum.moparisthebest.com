Time flies huh. Yeah, hahaha. I left right after I resigned from moderator, best decision I ever made. Unfortunately, I feel the need to open this forum growing and growing again. I even installed IRC today… I’m going backwards :S</p>
<p>I’ve been going pretty decent. Looking to make my professional debut in the MX Nationals in Australia maybe towards the end of the year or next year provided I stay injury free. Infact I think the last time I heard was when you left briefly because of losing your moderator job?</p>

So if males could give themselves head, the female race would go extinct? I think you’re forgetting the fact that giving yourself head is actually kind of gay, but i guess if you’re into it… Also it would cause the human race to go extinct, not just females. We’re more capable of doing things by ourselves, if you have not noticed. Good job though, great to see you’re thinking.<br>
