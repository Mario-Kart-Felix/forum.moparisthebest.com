    <title>Looking for a location?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-location/527687</link>
    <description>Hi I am looking for a place that is found in the Cold War quest in Runescape. It is called The White Palace. I am pretty sure that is the name but you can get to it through the Cold War quest only. I have played a few private servers that have used this area as a jail/staff zone and would be so happy if someone could tell me the co-ords to it. I have been everywhere on the Iceberg area and I cannot find it. I have tried coords with the -1 Z axis etc. But no luck, It would be amazing if someone had the coords to this as I really badly want that area as a staffzone. The servers that I have saw them on are now down for some reason so I cannot go there and ask for coords etc. Im not entirely sure how to get there myself depending on if I have to go somewhere completely different to Iceberg or if it is underground somewhere near it etc. Any help will be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you in advance!</description>
