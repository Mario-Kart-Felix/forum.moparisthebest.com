    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/attemped-murder-murder/120084</link>
    <description> If i tried to kill someone I only get maybe 25 years in prison.Now if i do kill someone i get life in prison.To me its the same,If you tried to kill someone you should be charged the same way as if you did kill someone.Now Why do they charge them diffrently?If someone tryed to kill someone once  whose to say they wont do it again.They might come back even harder on the person who they tried to kill,Post your opinions please.</description>

<p>A more extreme example would be this:  you’re driving along Route 80, and it’s midnight.  A guy dressed in all black runs across the highway, and you run him over at 60 (speed limit).  With a good lawyer, you get NOTHING.</p>

<p>yes but they most likely wouldent serve 25 years to life, because they werent doing anything illigal at the time like drunk driving or getting high, or even talking on there cell phone.allthough they shouldent have been taking their eyes off the road, it was not intended and was a simple mistake.</p>
