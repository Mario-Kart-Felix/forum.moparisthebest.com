    <title>Dialogue works on npc, except the one I want it on?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dialogue-works-on-npc-except-the-one-i-want-it-on/529913</link>
    <description>I am currently making multiple dialogue&#39;s for my server and as I was doing with a lot of npc&#39;s I made one for the survival expert, the thing is the dialogue seems to work on whatever npc I do it on but the survival expert, I&#39;ve tried multiple things but they don&#39;t seem to work, I also checked my NPChandler and DialogueHandler for sequals, no success.

Does anyone have an idea why this occurs? I certainly don&#39;t.

Will post code if requested.</description>

<p>I was already told this, and we already decided to “convert” it all considering htere is multiple scripts.<br>
Also, all the dialogues need a different value, all the dialogue’s we add ourselfs we give a value of 500+<br>
so 500 = 0, so we consider this as our 3rd dialogue.</p>

<p>Tell me what you want to see, I mean, the video pretty much shows you the issue and I don’t think the code is going to give you anything useful from there on, the npc handler doesn’t do anything with this npc aside from that what it does with the combat instructor shown in the video.</p>
<p>All I really need to know is what could possibly be blocking me from using the npc, either in the client or in the server, because I am unable to find it.</p>

<p>I just want to say I appriciate all the help you have given me so far.</p>
<p>Where would this != be located? because I actually don’t know especially because the dialogue works on every other npc I put it on.</p>
<p>And yes, you assign an npcid to a specific dialogue id that I create.</p>
