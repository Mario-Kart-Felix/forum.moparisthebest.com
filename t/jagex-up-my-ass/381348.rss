    <description>Well I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m allowed to post it here but if I&#39;m not I&#39;m sorry...


Fagex got access into my website and shut it down, it&#39;s an SMFforfree website and it&#39;s in maintenance mode and they changed my password... What the fuck do I do? My rsps is still online, do they want me to turn it off? In my email I keep getting emails saying:

&quot;Your e-mail has been received - Thank You.&quot; from &quot;parents@jagex.com&quot; and what the email says is:

get a real forum, get a real webhost, and next time don’t bitch that jagex stole ur smfforfree site, the only thing that could happen is that you’d get your site shut down fagex doesn’t edit smfforfree sites and take their domains.</p>

Well my website is down, either from Jagex or from a long ex-friend faggot named steven who got hold of one of my passwords when I left him on my teamviewer all night… also downloaded a trojan and watched some porn<br>

Let me get this straight. One of your ex friends has your password, you know you might have a virus, and when your website goes down you jump to “JAGEX DEY HAX ME”.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?[/quote]</p>
<p>He downloaded the trojan last March, and I last saw the asshole in November, I’m not sure if he still knows my password…</p>
