    <title>Adding pictures to interface?(Please read.)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-pictures-to-interface-please-read/273614</link>
    <description>I have the blank interfaces, and the one I&#39;m going to use as an exmample shows up and says &quot;What would you like to make?&quot; at the top, with two blank options(make 1,8874 and make 1,8878). You can right click them, and make 1, 5, 10, x shows up.  I wanna know how to put the picture of an item there.  Is that another interface, or can I use this one?  Shortbow and a longbow for now I guess.  Shortbow is 50, and longbow is 48.

Thanks.</description>
