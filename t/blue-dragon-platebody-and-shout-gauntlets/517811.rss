    <description>figured i would go ahead and show a picture but this is maybe the new blue dragon platebody (theres already a helm and platelegs and stuff but i dont feel like taking pictures of it all :D) im adding to the project, im probably gunna have amy touch it up if she feels its needed, and the big dragon heads on the arms are shout gauntlets which are gunna be a new item in the project. theres a lot of detail i could go into the project about this but i dont feel like it right now its too late for me ha.

well post your opinions made this like a month ago theres a lot of other models but i wanna save them for everyone to see when the project is out. by the way the projects name is &quot;a little piece of heaven&quot;.


will post low poly daedric armour me and amy made tomorrow looks boss trust me.


check out our site : alpoh.tk (tk until we feel its time that we actually need our own domain.)
the site doesnt have all the projects info on it but ima update it a lot sometime this week so i can keep people updated. well register and join forums also if you want.

<p>thanks for the opinions guys, i agree with the plate its just a basis still gotta add more to it but its a whole seperate model not meant to go with these gauntlets just was there so my friend (i sent him this picture figured id use it as a picture for this post) could see how it was suppost to look on the model but anyways, but if i make the sleeves any thinner the platebodies will show through and actually in game it looks decent i was very happy with how it turned out, i still gotta send it to amy though so she can touch it up a bit if she feels its needed. and also yea i might change the name the reason i made it “shout gauntlets” is because how in skyrim the player can do shouts ima make the special for the gauntlets a mage blast, and there will be many other color forms for this model as well, theres a lot of plans for adding this model into the project to its gunna be a very unqiue feature how we add all our new stuff into the game <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> thanks again though will definitely incorporate ya’lls ideas into this.</p>
