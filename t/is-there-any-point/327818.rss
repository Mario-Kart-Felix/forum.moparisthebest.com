    <title>Is there any point?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-there-any-point/327818</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;ve been away from here for quite some time now.  I&#39;m really wondering if there&#39;s actually anyone that still gets into RS cheating.

What I&#39;m really asking, I guess, is: Is it worth it to still try to make a bot? I mean, do you think people would use it? Do you think people would be motivated to script for it?

Thanks guys, I&#39;m just trying to find something to do, and I don&#39;t want it to be something that has absolutely no meaning (Little meaning would be way better :))</description>

              <p>Freddy is making one over at rs-hacking, Quirlion and KBot or still pretty strong, RSBot and iBot are never going to die, I suppose people are still supporting RS cheating, I don’t see why though.</p>
<p>I see no reason to however, it’s the most unproductive thing I can think of right now, unless a good profit is guaranteed.  I’ve moved onto programming non-runescape related things which is more fun I think, since it takes away the stress of having a to fight against the constantly changing things in runescape.  Making a bot is a complete waste now a days I’d say, but making a good pay script is okay to do, or program other games/applications for fun.</p>

I think Rsbot makes more money than iBot, have you seen that shitpile of ads they have? They probably have more users than iBot because of the Open Source-ness. I also think that they’d get a lot of donations…</p>
