    <description>I am playing Knight Online (yes it is a very gay game, so you do not need to tell me this...) anyways when you kill a monster a chest appear but its not always in the same spot in the screen nor is the window that contains the loot of the chest when you click the chest, neways I need help getting a script to only click if it finds the color of a box and if it finds that color click on the box and if it finds the color or an item in the loot window then to click on the item so basically it needs to scan for a color and if it finds the color then click on the x,y of that color is it even possible? I prolly sound like an idiot but I quit scar programming long before kaitnieks closed down, so I forgot how to use pretty much all the functions.</description>

              <p>[quote=“KyleGut3, post:4, topic:9612”]There are actual Hacks made for this game that will autoloot, etc for you.  Unless they revamped their security since I last played you can probably find working ones on the net.[/quote]Nah the Auto loot on KOSP/XP you need to pay to use it and I heard alot of people get scammed of their money when buying it because its just a bunch of Turkish Children basically that programmed it and the program that I do use(other then SCAR) doesn’t have an auto loot feature cuzz the maker can’t find out how to get that part of the memory like the KOSP/XP maker did… so nope there really isn’t one which is why I want to make my own.</p>

              <p>Ok I basically did eventually figure this out on my own I got it to find the boxes and all but the problem is in this game the objects are affected by time of day and shading and the camerazoom + the fact that they can have different angle views and surrounding monsters tend to have the same shade as certain parts of the box, or your armour may be shaded the same… and because of the angle difference I don’t see bitmaps being a good solution I made a very simple macro for the game while relearning scar and it works very nicely and I plan to keep making even better then it is now.</p>
<p>This just clicks a spell in the sidebar and then cast it for an aoe attack and waits for that set of monsters to respawn…very simple…but it works well… Now if only I could get the autoloot working <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
