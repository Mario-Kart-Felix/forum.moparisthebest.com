    <title>I need some help</title>

    <description>I need a lot of help with my server so I will ask all my questions here.

Ok, first question. My ::pnpc doesn&#39;t work. I have tried on a few different servers and none of them worked.

Second question. Is there any way that I could give someone when they first join my server to go to two places? Like...

Click a location to go there
Varrock                                                 Camelot

I also want to know if there is a way that I could put two servers together. Like if I have Satan&#39;s Isle and fr33sc4p3 pkz, I would want to put those two together. Like the npcs, portals, everything like that.

And last question. I need to know how to change what the admin/mod crowns look like. Maybe from gold to blue or something like that. I&#39;ve seen it done on a server. I&#39;ve looked everywhere and couldn&#39;t find answers to any of these.

Help would be appreciated.

              <p>For the pnpc, you might need to be admin, are you an admin on these servers you’ve tried it on?</p>
<p>Also you could use a dialogue to send an option for varrock or camelot.</p>
<p>To change sprites (mod icons in this case) you need a client with a modified cache.</p>
