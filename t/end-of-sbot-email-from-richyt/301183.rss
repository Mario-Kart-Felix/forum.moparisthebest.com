    <title>End of SBoT - Email from RichyT</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/end-of-sbot-email-from-richyt/301183</link>
    <description>So I thought it would be a great idea to post this old ass email from page 293 of my gmail inbox. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is a mass email from RichyT, www.sbot198.com

Hi

It&#39;s been a strange... 12 months - nearly to the day. It all started back in the day of free-games forums. Where, among the mess, I stumbled upon a non-keylogged SCAR, and &#39;teamed up&#39; with my first RS Cheating friend, Scythe. After discovering the magic of shemales, I decided to go on to better things. That&#39;s when we made rshacks forum... Infact, I remember see&#39;ing one of the original moderators from back then.

Then came richyt.com - which I believe Billy is still trying to do. Many many users, lots of experience gained in SCAR scripting - and the first time I tried my hand at AR (AsheyRune as it was back then) - that died in a day or so. This is also when I first met saevion, who is a great guy.

Billy took over, never been the same since - and I started using rscheatnet.com for a while. During that time I started a bot called SuXABoT, some of you will have heard of it - it ran AR style scripts, and was around in the time before mass-bottage. We had a small community on nenolod - a small gaming network. Then eP gave it to Sean, Sean cracked the pathetic auth - and released it to the masses.

Then, at some random point, I got a PM on RSCN IRC, saying to come to irc.autorune.org. AutoRune was finally back, and RaW gave me a free auth Smile. I stuck with AutoRune for a long time, and even into the days of SBoT.

Then came sbot irc, new location, new power, new people - all good stuff...

Today: I can&#39;t tell you exactly what happened, but I&#39;ll confirm it&#39;s nothing to do with the update, but what I did has given me no choice but to quit RS - it&#39;s the least I can do.



Thankyou&#39;s in order of appearance:
Scythe - met him on free-games forum some time last year, the only guy who wasn&#39;t out for a quick scam, made a nice little autominer once.

Saevion - the second memory, for some reason he helped me - and started my adventures into java land. He let me in on some slightly deobbed code, and I found out that ixBot was real Wink After a while of helping me, I guess he just got bored - and passed me on to Sean.

*RS2 release*

Sean - A great influence, without him there would have never been any SBoT, and I would never have made any sort of bot in my life. He had no reason to help me, but he did. He gave me the code to a really nooby RS2 autofighter - and showed me how to make a bot by using IT as an example, also sent me SITE - IT2, but not quite as sexy.

evilpat - Sean&#39;s evil partner in crime, always good for a laugh - part of the SAB community Smile

PR4Y - The love of my life, there isn&#39;t a day goes by without thinking about him Sad - great guy.

Mediator - steals your info, loses to me on CS Smile

RaW - met him, he had a history of scamming, and wasn&#39;t going to give up easily. If you knock away the scamming and the bullshitting, he&#39;s not that bad - he never actually scammed me, so it didn&#39;t really bother me at all Smile

waffendennis - great guy, without him SBoT would have died months ago, even though he is a jagex mod - he&#39;s one hell of a good guy, and hasn&#39;t done anything but good for us all.

My 2nd cousin Lee - If I hadn&#39;t got suspended for doing &#39;nasty&#39; things to him, I wouldnt have made SBoT. As some of you may remember, I made it in the 2 days I was suspended from school.

Kaitnieks - Everyone knows Kaitnieks! Great guy, knows a lot of stuff about a lot of stuff, was willing to go out of his way to help me - without him there would be no SBoT.

SaladFork - great guy, even though he hasn&#39;t been around lately he still owns ass.

haxorjr - He left a long time ago, even though he was a bit of a noob as you would say, he&#39;s a great guy - havn&#39;t seen him in a while, good times though... good times.

P_0_T - cool guy, share a server with him, kept me sane - the only guy who has my real phone number &lt;3

RaiZeN - introduced me to the great world of CS, hope we stay in touch - even though you did(not?(not?(not?))) scam P_0_T, your still aight.

GhOsT_ID - &lt;3

Vegunks - Great moderator, keeps the peace well.

Phate - Great guy, good luck with wastedbot.

Tobbe - great guy, loves my cash as I love him.

evo - havn&#39;t had much of a conversation with him, but we&#39;ve had the odd PM session on TARC. Great guy, very intelligent and obviously very talented.

Nicoleta - none of you have ever met her, and I doubt you ever will - nor will she ever read this, however - she is the coder of the OCR. She is a great person to talk to, always proffessional and obviously has a great future in coding.

Those are the ones I can remember, I&#39;m sure that there are many more I have missed out - but no &lt;3 loss. Especially the forum moderators - you&#39;ve done a great job.

What now you ask?
Well, I will leave this server running for as long as I can manage. Maybe, if Tobbe will pay $70 towards the fund (I&#39;m sure you will find a way to gather that much a month) then this server will stay for another month. I&#39;m not sure about the IRC server though, I have only paid 1 installment, and it&#39;s been a good 3 months Wink FOCR is on this server, so for as long as sleeping is as it is, that will stay. I will go through a mass-ban of my own, and remove a lot of people from my MSN list that I don&#39;t talk to on a regular basis - nothing personal, it&#39;s just getting very crowded in there. I&#39;ll hang around IRC for a while, just to keep the peace. But no more FOCR auths will be sold, and I wont be helping people with SBoT problems... No - SBoT source code won&#39;t be released.

I have been contemplating leaving for a while, as some of you may know I started thinking about leaving back when everything died on me, and my money got lost. For something I have done now, I have no choice but to leave - I can&#39;t stay with knowning what I have done.

I do hope you all enjoyed SBoT, and what it has brought you. I also hope that you will think as me as a positive in the world of RS cheating.

Well, I think that&#39;s it.
36 hours, 3 hours sleep - it&#39;s been a bad day or 2 for me, hope it wasn&#39;t so bad for the rest of you.

It&#39;s been fun Smile
Richard Taylor.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dated as 10/28/04.

I smiled a bit when I read the part about waffendennis.</description>

              <p>So I thought it would be a great idea to post this old ass email from page 293 of my gmail inbox.</p>
<blockquote>This is a mass email from RichyT, www.sbot198.com
<p>Hi</p>
<p>It’s been a strange… 12 months - nearly to the day. It all started back in the day of free-games forums. Where, among the mess, I stumbled upon a non-keylogged SCAR, and ‘teamed up’ with my first RS Cheating friend, Scythe. After discovering the magic of shemales, I decided to go on to better things. That’s when we made rshacks forum… Infact, I remember see’ing one of the original moderators from back then.</p>
<p>Then came <a href="http://richyt.com" rel="nofollow noopener">richyt.com</a> - which I believe Billy is still trying to do. Many many users, lots of experience gained in SCAR scripting - and the first time I tried my hand at AR (AsheyRune as it was back then) - that died in a day or so. This is also when I first met saevion, who is a great guy.</p>
<p>Billy took over, never been the same since - and I started using <a href="http://rscheatnet.com" rel="nofollow noopener">rscheatnet.com</a> for a while. During that time I started a bot called SuXABoT, some of you will have heard of it - it ran AR style scripts, and was around in the time before mass-bottage. We had a small community on nenolod - a small gaming network. Then eP gave it to Sean, Sean cracked the pathetic auth - and released it to the masses.</p>
<p>Then, at some random point, I got a PM on RSCN IRC, saying to come to <a href="http://irc.autorune.org" rel="nofollow noopener">irc.autorune.org</a>. AutoRune was finally back, and RaW gave me a free auth Smile. I stuck with AutoRune for a long time, and even into the days of SBoT.</p>
<p>Then came sbot irc, new location, new power, new people - all good stuff…</p>
<p>Today: I can’t tell you exactly what happened, but I’ll confirm it’s nothing to do with the update, but what I did has given me no choice but to quit RS - it’s the least I can do.</p>
<p>Thankyou’s in order of appearance:<br>
Scythe - met him on free-games forum some time last year, the only guy who wasn’t out for a quick scam, made a nice little autominer once.</p>
<p>Saevion - the second memory, for some reason he helped me - and started my adventures into java land. He let me in on some slightly deobbed code, and I found out that ixBot was real Wink After a while of helping me, I guess he just got bored - and passed me on to Sean.</p>
<p><em>RS2 release</em></p>
<p>Sean - A great influence, without him there would have never been any SBoT, and I would never have made any sort of bot in my life. He had no reason to help me, but he did. He gave me the code to a really nooby RS2 autofighter - and showed me how to make a bot by using IT as an example, also sent me SITE - IT2, but not quite as sexy.</p>
<p>evilpat - Sean’s evil partner in crime, always good for a laugh - part of the SAB community Smile</p>
<p>PR4Y - The love of my life, there isn’t a day goes by without thinking about him Sad - great guy.</p>
<p>Mediator - steals your info, loses to me on CS Smile</p>
<p>RaW - met him, he had a history of scamming, and wasn’t going to give up easily. If you knock away the scamming and the bullshitting, he’s not that bad - he never actually scammed me, so it didn’t really bother me at all Smile</p>
<p>waffendennis - great guy, without him SBoT would have died months ago, even though he is a jagex mod - he’s one hell of a good guy, and hasn’t done anything but good for us all.</p>
<p>My 2nd cousin Lee - If I hadn’t got suspended for doing ‘nasty’ things to him, I wouldnt have made SBoT. As some of you may remember, I made it in the 2 days I was suspended from school.</p>
<p>Kaitnieks - Everyone knows Kaitnieks! Great guy, knows a lot of stuff about a lot of stuff, was willing to go out of his way to help me - without him there would be no SBoT.</p>
<p>SaladFork - great guy, even though he hasn’t been around lately he still owns ass.</p>
<p>haxorjr - He left a long time ago, even though he was a bit of a noob as you would say, he’s a great guy - havn’t seen him in a while, good times though… good times.</p>
<p>P_0_T - cool guy, share a server with him, kept me sane - the only guy who has my real phone number &lt;3</p>
<p>RaiZeN - introduced me to the great world of CS, hope we stay in touch - even though you did(not?(not?(not?))) scam P_0_T, your still aight.</p>
<p>GhOsT_ID - &lt;3</p>
<p>Vegunks - Great moderator, keeps the peace well.</p>
<p>Phate - Great guy, good luck with wastedbot.</p>
<p>Tobbe - great guy, loves my cash as I love him.</p>
<p>evo - havn’t had much of a conversation with him, but we’ve had the odd PM session on TARC. Great guy, very intelligent and obviously very talented.</p>
<p>Nicoleta - none of you have ever met her, and I doubt you ever will - nor will she ever read this, however - she is the coder of the OCR. She is a great person to talk to, always proffessional and obviously has a great future in coding.</p>
<p>Those are the ones I can remember, I’m sure that there are many more I have missed out - but no &lt;3 loss. Especially the forum moderators - you’ve done a great job.</p>
<p>What now you ask?<br>
Well, I will leave this server running for as long as I can manage. Maybe, if Tobbe will pay $70 towards the fund (I’m sure you will find a way to gather that much a month) then this server will stay for another month. I’m not sure about the IRC server though, I have only paid 1 installment, and it’s been a good 3 months Wink FOCR is on this server, so for as long as sleeping is as it is, that will stay. I will go through a mass-ban of my own, and remove a lot of people from my MSN list that I don’t talk to on a regular basis - nothing personal, it’s just getting very crowded in there. I’ll hang around IRC for a while, just to keep the peace. But no more FOCR auths will be sold, and I wont be helping people with SBoT problems… No - SBoT source code won’t be released.</p>
<p>I have been contemplating leaving for a while, as some of you may know I started thinking about leaving back when everything died on me, and my money got lost. For something I have done now, I have no choice but to leave - I can’t stay with knowning what I have done.</p>
<p>I do hope you all enjoyed SBoT, and what it has brought you. I also hope that you will think as me as a positive in the world of RS cheating.</p>
<p>Well, I think that’s it.<br>
36 hours, 3 hours sleep - it’s been a bad day or 2 for me, hope it wasn’t so bad for the rest of you.</p>
<p>It’s been fun Smile<br>
