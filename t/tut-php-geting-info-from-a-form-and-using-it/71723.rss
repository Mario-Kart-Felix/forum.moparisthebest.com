    <title>[tut][php] geting info from a form and using it</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tut-php-geting-info-from-a-form-and-using-it/71723</link>
    <description>ok well i seen that star wanted this so ill post it up  :) 

ok well so you have made your html form on a page and you would like to get that info and &quot;do some thing with it&quot; well that is easy. *strips off down to my boxers and gets ready to make a tut 0.o*

ok well how do you do it?
first off you want your html form and you need to have a few thing in there

&lt;form name=&#39;feedback&#39; method=&#39;post&#39; action=&quot;./contactusmail.php&quot;&gt;

ok the first thing is a name just call it anything you like 

the second thing is important its &#39;get&#39; or &#39;post&#39; what&#39;s the diff?? that&#39;s easy have you ever seen a huge url after you have submitted something well that is get it transfers the data that the user has inputed in through the address bar but post will send it through a different way so that it is more secure for the user and you 

take this if i went over my friends house and he went on his favourite site that requires him to login the web developer is not that good and he used get all i would have to do is look in his address bar and it would be something like http://www.moparisthebest.com/login.php?username=n00b1password=lolyouwish or it might be a crazy string that could be de encrypted if you know how so it aint that good to use get i normally use post and i will be using it here 

anyway back to the tutorial then you need an action this is were the information will be submitted on the submit button clicked so lets get an email form set up because i know all you n00bs from moparscape 
&quot;WaNtS RS usrnames nd passes coz you wants to be l33t&quot; well you will have to work out on how to convert it  :P (offtopic: if you want to cheak out my home made rs pusher go to www.xtremetutorials.co.uk/rs please don&#39;t spam it up )
right what do you need to make this email to you well a html form  (im not making this fancy thats your job =p)
[code]
&lt;form name=&#39;feedback&#39; method=&#39;post&#39; action=&quot;mailus.php&quot;&gt;
name: &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; size=&quot;40&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
email: &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;email&quot; size=&quot;40&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
subject: &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;subject&quot; size=&quot;40&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
message: &lt;textarea name=&quot;message&quot; rows=&quot;8&quot; cols=&quot;45&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; name=&quot;send&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot;&gt;
[/code]
save that to a file on your server called contact.html

now the harder part you need to capture the info and then send it to your email.

how do you do that well make a file called mailus.php in the same place as the html file and add this in
[php]
&lt;?php
$subject = $_POST[&#39;subject&#39;];
$name = $POST_[&#39;name&#39;];
$email = $_POST[&#39;email&#39;];
$text = $_POST[&#39;message&#39;];
$message = &quot;Here is a contact us e-mail sent via the Xtremetutorials.co.uk website by $name 

$name email address is $email
$subject
$text&quot;;
mail(&quot;makka.n00b1@googlemail.com&quot;, $subject, $message);
header(&#39;Location: index.php);
?&gt;
[/php]
if your posh you can do it like this i find it better like this
[php]
&lt;?php
$ip = getenv(&quot;REMOTE_ADDR&quot;);
$date = date(&quot;l, F j, Y, g:i a&quot;);
$subject = $_POST[&#39;subject&#39;];
$name = $POST_[&#39;name&#39;];
$email = $_POST[&#39;email&#39;];
$text = $_POST[&#39;message&#39;];
$message = &quot;Here is a contact us e-mail sent via the Xtremetutorials.co.uk website by $name on $date 

$name email address is $email
$subject
$text&quot;;
$from = &quot;this is from $ip&quot;;
mail(&quot;makka.n00b1@googlemail.com&quot;, $subject, $message, $from);
header(&#39;Location: index.php);
?&gt;
[/php]
now to explain 
well i think you all know what the $whatevers are id not they are variables in PHP witch start with a $ sign symbol. Variables may contain strings, numbers, or arrays.
ok so what are you saying here $subject = $_POST[&#39;subject&#39;];
well you are saying that the variable subject is what ever some one inputed to the subject box how do you get what some one put into the box well you use $_POST[&#39;name&#39;] or $_GET[&#39;name&#39;] what are the difference? well remember the different types at the top you just use them to suite the type you used.
now that you have saved all of those to variables you need to use that info so we use the mail function
now the servers it uses should be set by your host if you having truble email them but first look here http://www.php.net/mail (i think that&#39;s the url?) 
so you are saying that you want it to mail to... my email  :| why did i put that in  :confused: please don&#39;t spam then you want the $subject, $message, $from to show up in it i allways put that in the message anyway 
then after it has mailed it will redirect you to the index of your site 

[b]l33t part[/b]
ok then now to explain the l33t part for you l33t members  ;D
$ip = getenv(&quot;REMOTE_ADDR&quot;); this is getting the remote address of the user who submitted it and will send it to you and the $date = date(&quot;l, F j, Y, g:i a&quot;); will get the day month year hour minute and second (i think)

any way i think that rapes it up as always i wright this out of my head and don&#39;t test (don&#39;t know why) but if you need any help then ask this wont work from your local host unless you have set it up just get a host with mail on it and it should work.</description>

<p>take this if i went over my friends house and he went on his favourite site that requires him to login the web developer is not that good and he used get all i would have to do is look in his address bar and it would be something like <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/login.php?username=n00b1password=lolyouwish" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/login.php?username=n00b1password=lolyouwish</a> or it might be a crazy string that could be de encrypted if you know how so it aint that good to use get i normally use post and i will be using it here</p>
<p>anyway back to the tutorial then you need an action this is were the information will be submitted on the submit button clicked so lets get an email form set up because i know all you n00bs from moparscape<br>
“WaNtS RS usrnames nd passes coz you wants to be l33t” well you will have to work out on how to convert it  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> (offtopic: if you want to cheak out my home made rs pusher go to <a href="http://www.xtremetutorials.co.uk/rs" rel="nofollow noopener">www.xtremetutorials.co.uk/rs</a> please don’t spam it up )<br>
right what do you need to make this email to you well a html form  (im not making this fancy thats your job =p)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;form name='feedback' method='post' action="mailus.php"&gt;
name: &lt;input type="text" name="name" size="40"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
email: &lt;input type="text" name="email" size="40"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
subject: &lt;input type="text" name="subject" size="40"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
message: &lt;textarea name="message" rows="8" cols="45"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
&lt;input type="submit" name="send" value="Submit"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>save that to a file on your server called contact.html</p>
<p>now the harder part you need to capture the info and then send it to your email.</p>
<p>how do you do that well make a file called mailus.php in the same place as the html file and add this in<br>
[php]</p>
&lt;?php
$subject = $_POST['subject'];
$name = $POST_['name'];
$email = $_POST['email'];
$text = $_POST['message'];
$message = "Here is a contact us e-mail sent via the Xtremetutorials.co.uk website by $name 

$name email address is $email
$subject
$text";
mail("makka.n00b1@googlemail.com", $subject, $message);
header('Location: index.php);
?&gt;
<p>[/php]<br>
if your posh you can do it like this i find it better like this<br>
[php]</p>
&lt;?php
$ip = getenv("REMOTE_ADDR");
$date = date("l, F j, Y, g:i a");
$subject = $_POST['subject'];
$name = $POST_['name'];
$email = $_POST['email'];
$text = $_POST['message'];
$message = "Here is a contact us e-mail sent via the Xtremetutorials.co.uk website by $name on $date 

$name email address is $email
$subject
$text";
$from = "this is from $ip";
mail("makka.n00b1@googlemail.com", $subject, $message, $from);
header('Location: index.php);
?&gt;
<p>[/php]<br>
now to explain<br>
well i think you all know what the $whatevers are id not they are variables in PHP witch start with a $ sign symbol. Variables may contain strings, numbers, or arrays.<br>
ok so what are you saying here $subject = $_POST[‘subject’];<br>
well you are saying that the variable subject is what ever some one inputed to the subject box how do you get what some one put into the box well you use $_POST[‘name’] or $_GET[‘name’] what are the difference? well remember the different types at the top you just use them to suite the type you used.<br>
now that you have saved all of those to variables you need to use that info so we use the mail function<br>
now the servers it uses should be set by your host if you having truble email them but first look here <a href="http://www.php.net/mail" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.php.net/mail</a> (i think that’s the url?)<br>
so you are saying that you want it to mail to… my email  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=6" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"> why did i put that in  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=6" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> please don’t spam then you want the $subject, $message, $from to show up in it i allways put that in the message anyway<br>
then after it has mailed it will redirect you to the index of your site</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">l33t part</span><br>
ok then now to explain the l33t part for you l33t members  ;D<br>
$ip = getenv(“REMOTE_ADDR”); this is getting the remote address of the user who submitted it and will send it to you and the $date = date(“l, F j, Y, g:i a”); will get the day month year hour minute and second (i think)</p>
<p>any way i think that rapes it up as always i wright this out of my head and don’t test (don’t know why) but if you need any help then ask this wont work from your local host unless you have set it up just get a host with mail on it and it should work.</p>
