    <title>Looking For A Website Partner</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-website-partner/426030</link>
    <description>I have a great website idea (at least in my opinion) that I&#39;ve never seen used on any other site. I bought a domain, 6 months of hosting, and a wordpress template off templatemonster that I&#39;m currently editing and setting up the site with. I think it&#39;s possible for this site to go big if done right for sure. I actually made a smaller version of the site when i was in highschool and it got pretty big in my city and surrounding cities. Now I&#39;m looking to remake it and make it bigger.

I&#39;m looking for someone to partner up with me in making the site. I&#39;m looking for someone who has some free time to help work and improve the site with me. Someone who preferably can code html,css,php, etc. The more the better.  If you&#39;re interested please let me know what coding experience you have and any sites of your own. If I think your suitable , I&#39;ll PM you the website details and we can go from there.</description>

<p>ideas are patented… not the actual product… a idea also known as a business model patent (a method of doing some idea) could be worth a million dollars.</p>
<p>You may think selling RSGP… or any type of virtual goods is not profitable… but once you made over 50k$ usd in sales… you’ll start to realize you can make money out of anything as long as you think it’s a good idea.</p>

<p>Again it wouldnt be my site, it would be ours. We’d both work on it, thats what a partnership is. Im not looking for an employee, im looking for a partner who WANTS to work on a project with me. I said i would pm the idea and from there, YOU COULD decide if you want to be partof the project or not. Mopman your a fuckin moron.</p>

<p>Jesus im done trying, ill go to a different site. My main skill is i beleive i have an idea which i think could become HUGE and i can work on the site (as im doing now). This idea is unique and never used before and a good one at that (not easy to come up with a good unique website idea thats not already made). If you are too lazy to wrte up your skills then receive a pm of me telling you the idea, for you to accept or deny working on, then indont want you working with me anyway.</p>
<p>So im done goin back and forth. If anyone else is interested just post up your skills and if it looks like you can code at least decently.  ill pm you the details.</p>

<p>No… If you partner with me. The site wont be just mine, it will be ours. You will own half the site. If it does become big and we make money, you get half. And i already bought hosting, the domain, and a template. Im not looking for an employee, im looking for a partner. We both would work on the site IF you like the idea and agree to partner up with me and make it.</p>

<p>My skills arnt great but im not horrible either. But my idea makes up for it. Why should you want to help me? Why wouldnt you want to help yourself?</p>
<p>Let me put this simpler than i have already. Im not saying any of you HAVE to join me. But if your looking to make a website that could possibly become a big site, i have an idea for a site that could do just that. Now if you have your own idea, great, go make it happen. But if not, why not post your skills here and possibly be able to join me in making the site. Like i said… If you have some good skills, post here and I WILL PM YOU AND TELL YOU THE IDEA. From there you can decide if you want to join me or not. The site wouldnt be just mine, it would be ours so you arnt just helping me, we will be helping each other.</p>

<p>Well id like a headstart on it before anyone else works on it…</p>
<p>But this is getting rediculous, i didnt ask anyone to do anything complicated. All i asked was for someone to post their skills then ill send them a pm about the website… You post your skills and in return you get my idea in which you might actually want to create with me. How hard is that really? If no one can do/wants to do this ill go on another forum where someone will…</p>

<p>Haha no, i knew someone was going to say that. This is only 1 type of videos, and the other part of it i cant say or it will give the idea away. But it isnt going to be a youtube remake lol</p>
<p>This is getting redundent though… Someone who is experienced and trusted on here tell me what skills you have so i can send you the idea and you can tell everyone here your opinion on the idea lol</p>

<p>EDIT: It has just occurred me to you could be doing some fun community none profit driven idea. In which case you should have said so.[/quote]</p>
<p>Alright heres what ill say… This is not a get rich quick site, a gpt or any kind of ads site, and we arnt selling anything. This will be a media website containing “certain kind of videos” (not porn… lol) Which in my opinion could become huge (not right away of course, will take some time). I can see teens in highschools everywhere using this site but at the same time my dad whos 40 would even use the site. Im not making it to make money but i can deffinitly see it becoming a popular site in the future and making money.</p>
<p>I myself can only code in html and edit php and css a little. But by partnering with me you get my idea, someone to bounce ideas off with (i have some geat ideas for the site), and someone to work with. I can easily do all the main things by myself but would like someone to work with and help with the little bit more complicated things. We can also add another partner if we need one, but i doubt we will at least until/if the site gets bigger.</p>
<p>Heres what ill do, someone who is trusted here and is good at webdesigning, ill send them my idea and they can either join in with me or not its up to them, but they can post here their thoughts of the idea</p>
