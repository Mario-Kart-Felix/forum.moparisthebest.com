    <title>What&#39;s done to YOUR car?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whats-done-to-your-car/326471</link>
    <description>As the topic states, what do you drive and what have you done to it? I&#39;m just curious to see what everybody has done/built.

I hab n0 nahledge of vehikles. 

BUT:
I can build a motor from start to finish (including buying the block from a junkyard) to cover a quarter mile in 13 seconds (not that fast but still...) for $500 in a 3400 lb car. Suck on that.


Edit:
I&#39;m in the process of building a drag car. Will be caging the car soon, tubbing the rear when I replace the axle, tube k-member with solid mounts, fiberglass front end like the pro-stock cars, and lexan windows. As far as suspension goes, it&#39;ll remain pretty much stock up front and in the back I&#39;ll just be lowering the lower control arms and running a stiffer set of shocks. While I have the motor out for the tube k-member I&#39;ll throw in a higher stall torque converter and try to get the thing to stand up off the line with a 100 shot. Spraying and praying for high 10&#39;s when it&#39;s totally done, we shall see. The car should weigh in at under 3300 lbs with me in it when it&#39;s done.</description>

<p>jesus… what the hell is wrong with your driving record kid. im a farmers insurance agent and hell i have two claims and a speeding ticket and i pay $2.2k less than you do. thats just ridiculous. your age is defiantly affecting that, because lets face it, you are far more likely to go drag racing down the street then say your father. however that isn’t enough to cost you 3k every 6 months. maybe its just that insurance is a bit different in England. the only insurer i deal with over there is Loyd’s of London and even then its normally only for commercial insurance. i’d talk to your agent and see if there is something wrong. but thats just me.<br>

I drive this car. It’s pretty good, I modded the inside with some tape on the seats to make it feel like a racing car. I’ve made it go about 100mph before going downhill and it’s pretty comfortable. It is also quite fuel efficient which is nice.</p>

              <p>As the topic states, what do you drive and what have you done to it? I’m just curious to see what everybody has done/built.</p>
<p>I hab n0 nahledge of vehikles.</p>
<p>BUT:<br>
I can build a motor from start to finish (including buying the block from a junkyard) to cover a quarter mile in 13 seconds (not that fast but still…) for $500 in a 3400 lb car. Suck on that.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
I’m in the process of building a drag car. Will be caging the car soon, tubbing the rear when I replace the axle, tube k-member with solid mounts, fiberglass front end like the pro-stock cars, and lexan windows. As far as suspension goes, it’ll remain pretty much stock up front and in the back I’ll just be lowering the lower control arms and running a stiffer set of shocks. While I have the motor out for the tube k-member I’ll throw in a higher stall torque converter and try to get the thing to stand up off the line with a 100 shot. Spraying and praying for high 10’s when it’s totally done, we shall see. The car should weigh in at under 3300 lbs with me in it when it’s done.</p>
