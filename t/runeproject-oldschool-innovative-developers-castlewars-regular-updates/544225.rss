[SPOILER=Show Updates]


LATEST UPDATES:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]RUNEPROJECT IS NOW IN PHASE 4/ VERSION 4. THIS IS THE BIGGEST AND MOST EXCITING VERSION SO FAR, IN MY OPINION![/b]

[b]New OldSchool Boss!:[/b]

The Kraken is an Octopus like monster, using a Mage attack. When fighting you are viable to death.  
Kraken is located East of the Bandit Camp @Level 34 Wilderness. He sits in the water, and drops appear on the shore. 
The Kraken will hit over your prayer protected every time the randomize of 3, hits a value of 1. 

[b]OldSchool Items: [/b]

Trident of the Seas: Dropped by the Kraken, has a strong mage attack. 
Tentacle Whip: Also dropped by the Kraken, a strong melee attack. 
Armadyl C&#39;bow: Dropped by Saradomin, has a ranged attack. 

[b]OldSchool GameFrame: [/b]

We have changed our Gameframe making it almost identical to OldSchool RS, the running orb is pending to be replaced with an XP counter. 

- New orbs
- New Tab area
- New Map area
- New compass 

[b]Improved Switching:[/b]

Our switching speeds were complained about, so we did our best to speed it up, this is also a constant development on making our switching worthy of a &#39;Perfect&#39; title but you will definitely know the difference.

[b]Redesigned GUI:[/b]

- Client Settings Interfaces now used X marks to show activeness, it also has an attractive new design. 
- Slayer Task Interface now also redesigned making it more attractive. 

[b]Fixed/Added GUI:[/b]

- The bank now has a bank all invent option, we did this last minute in the client update as it was wanted, we will improve the banking interface in V4.1
- The Song Tab has been fixed, as it was showing random sprites such as emotes. 
- The ClanChat was bugging for a few people due to OperatingSystems, this has been fixed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[QUOTE=Freedom317;4583701]Logged onto the server today &amp; from what I&#39;ve seen so far it&#39;s absolutely incredible.

Firstly, the custom interfaces are so clean and simple yet elegant and extremely beautiful, 
especially the slayer interface. This also includes the custom client background and login box,
as soon as I loaded up the client I was attracted to the server.

Secondly, the team that helps the server do an awesome job, they have their own graphics artist,
multiple developers and they even have a guy for security, this server definitely has its shit together!

Lastly, I will definitely be playing this server for a while because it&#39;s honestly one of the best I&#39;ve played.
I highly suggest checking it out if you&#39;re looking for a professional, simple and more importantly FUN server.

<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-i">To get started I’ll state the small things.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Birds Nests</span>:<br>
Birds Nests were always randomly given while woodcutting, but never had a purpose, they know when and when clicked on give a random reward along with the empty birds nest.<br>
Some of the rewards include:<br>
Cluescrolls<br>
Gems<br>
Cosmic Runes<br>
Seeds</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Wilderness Obelisk Fixed:</span><br>
I believe there was a visual bug, they were disabled but then due to high complaints of people not liking running to Mage bank; as it’s effort, they were brought back, they may randomly appear around the map again but report them where you see them and we’ll try our best to fix them.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Login Messages:</span><br>
Only staff now have login messages for moderation/administration use, such as letting members know who they can ask for help etc.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Herblore:</span><br>
On request of Atlas, herblore XP has been highered to fit a nice ratio against farming experience, Farming 3:2 Herblore.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">New Quest Tab:</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">The quest tab is now a multi-page information platform, you may switch your Quest tab to what you want to see, this includes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Quests, a list of all working Quests</li>
<li>Achievements, a list of achievements with the quest style progress tracking(red, yellow, green)</li>
<li>Statistics, Server Exp Bonus, Last voter, RuneProject Points, amount of votes and Ranking</li>
<li>Links, basically the forums navigation in the quest tab.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">All of the aboves content will be clickable for information, but I forgot to finish that and will have it done for V6.1</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">New OldSchool Items:</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Staff of The Dead</span> - With all features<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Smoke Battlestaff</span> - Air and Fire rune substitute<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Occult Necklace</span> - 10% Magic boost<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Zamorakian Hasta</span> - A zamorak Spear<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">LavaDragon Bones</span> - Provide prayer exp equal to Dagganoths<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Elite Cluescrolls</span> - Will be finished over the next few days and added to OS bosses drops</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Lava Dragons:</span><br>
The dragons do not yet have the texture but we do plan on having it really soon.<br>
Rarest drops include Dragon boots, Dragonic Visage and Dragon Pickaxe<br>
They are located North of the Vet’ion teleport in Level 47 Wilderness(Multi)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Fareed:</span><br>
A boss of fire descent, will burn through spells casted on him, which makes him immune to barraging and entangles, currently to test his strength he is not Multi, but will cast his magic attack on those near by.<br>
Location: Through the teleport behind the Quest tent in Varrock.<br>
Rarest Drops: Smoke Battlestaff, Occult Necklace.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Kill Log V2:</span><br>
A complete new design for the kill log with multi page support, it will also save your page so that you won’t have to switch through when tracking a certain kill.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Client Design:</span><br>
Big thanks to preference for the design  changes in the Kill log, client background and the title box. He has made us sexy again :D.</p>
<p>I believe that is all, but as always if I remember something I will update the thread.</p>

              <p>Updates of the last two days:</p>
<blockquote>[align=center][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/r9zhclT.png[/img][/align]
<p>Note: I am working on Highscores amongst other things, but we cannot go without not updating, we’re still in constant pursuit of perfection.</p>
<p>[align=center]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Imp Catcher:</span><br>
A new quest suggested and written by Colossux, you can start this quest by speaking to Mizgog at the Draynor wizards tower, it’s the same storyline as RS but the dialogue isn’t exactly the same.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Added monsters to the kill log:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Mithril Dragons</li>
<li>Barrelchest</li>
<li>Dagannoth Rex</li>
<li>Dagannoth Prime</li>
<li>Dagannoth Supreme</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Dropping:</span><br>
Iron men were suggesting that their drops should not be disabled but disappear when they do drop, then I began to wonder why anyone really needs to ‘legally’ drop items. So for this moment in time all users drops will disappear(Not permanent).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">AutoDonating: </span><br>
Our donation system for points is now automatic, as for the incentives for free donator statuses, they are added alongside with exceptions for staff or if you hold a lower donator rank than the one you are going to receive. I will be adding total votes and total donations, then you will automatically be moved up a donator rank after a certain amount and after a certain amount of times voted, give them a voteboost for a certain period of time.</p>
<p>Completionist Cape:<br>
The completionist cape now holds the same bonuses as the Fire Cape, instead of finding out all of the parameters for the configuration file that handles the bonuses, I took the easy approach and gave it the same as a Fire Cape, but if this is a problem and you disagree with it being like this then notify me and I will correct it in the next update.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Flecthing: </span><br>
There was a report about not being able to start fletching as you couldn’t turn wood into arrow shafts, this is now fixed and I did it in a way where you can move on quickly; as you use a knife on the logs it will turn your whole inventory into arrow shafts. (Stacked, ofcourse.)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">RuneProject Points:</span><br>
Speaking to the King behind the magic store will present you with 4 options of what you can currently use RPP on, this is now how it will always be, most of what I do is a ongoing Project, meaning things will get more complex in regards of what you can use the points, how they are obtained through random events and through more complex and a full achievement system.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Iron Man:</span><br>
Instead of the prior Ironman and remove Iron man command, you will now speak to the Dwarf(Red axe henchman) in varrock, he will speak to you, tell you how you can visit the rules, this is in a way considered a game mode of RuneProject, as they will be on the Highscores in their own category as well as being listed on the main overall board. Being a Iron Man is for your own entertainment and achievement, so enjoy it and if you feel restricted in any way please let me know, I plan to progress this system also by disabling all of the supply stores and making one store, which will take the IronCoin(Not fully thought of the name yet) currency, in which you will receive for Iron man only achievements.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Voting Changes: </span><br>
For my own analytics of voting, I have now made the voting message print what you have voted for to see what reward is most favourited, I noticed even without this message that “40 Yells” was in great decline, so I have thrown them out and replaced it with voting for both RPP and VP(Vote points), and it seems to be a great decision you have to make, and I’m seeing a lot of people varying between these two rewards. As I’ve explained for probably everything else on this thread, the voting rewards and loyalty of everyday voters will come with a reward sooner or later, along with more votepoint rewards and more reward options for voting.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Where the fuck did Hans go?:</span><br>
The story of Hans’ kidnap is still completely classified, but with his absence we have sadly had to replace him with Harold Evans, the dialogue has been changed for Horacio(If that’s how his name is spelt) to tell you to speak to Harold Evans, he also holds the same dialogue as Hans did for the Dragon Slayer quest.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Stability(We probably talk about stability in every update now, but it’s for the better :D):</span><br>
Thanks to Tim: Two separate threads were made, one for the main processes that RuneProject runs, then another for Highscores, to explain a little, separating threads is like putting fish into separate tanks, if a shark(bug) comes along and decides to eat up all of our fish as we keep them in one tank, we have to restart over again(Re-run the server manually). So in simple terms, Tim has made two extra tanks, one for the Highscores as they were once one of the biggest lag contributors(When they were running) and the main processes to ensure no error will take down the server unless it’s caused by something in the back end which is unlikely that we will not notice the problem while the server is being tested.</p>
<p>Wow… That took a while, but enjoy and lets hope for more updates soon :D.</p>
<p>Also: The reason there is not as much content is that Yonas has gone on Holiday for a week with his friends, he should be back in the next couple of days then we’re hitting that Rs07 cache, more models, more items, more monsters!<br>
