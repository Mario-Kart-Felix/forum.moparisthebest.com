    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/1989-corvette-6-speed-z51/436838</link>
    <description>Hey, I was wondering if this this is worth getting. I already made enough money to get it. I really like corvettes, but I don&#39;t have that much money to get the newer models.

<p>There are multiple things wrong with that, which Greeny and TheBeanie have covered a bit.  But also, that corvette is a MUCH better deal then that mustang, which is a rip-off, and the corvette is a MUCH better ‘race car’ than the mustang in every conceivable way except maybe in a perfectly straight line.  It has much better brakes, better suspension, is lighter, and actually has a better engine too.  If you spend the $7500 on the corvette, and then spend the difference from the price of the mustang ($2500) building up the corvette engine some more, you would have a much nicer and insanely faster car than the mustang ever could be.</p>
<p>Also, street racing is stupid, around here you can go to the drag strip on friday nights and pay $5 to race your car down it all you want.  I’m sure there are similar things around where you live, call around, or look on the internet.<br>

Alright I’ll get the corvette then. How would I go on to modify the car? Would supercharging the car be a good idea?[/quote]<br>
Drive it first and see if it NEEDS to be modified, my bet is it’s probably already too much car for you to handle right now.  But yes, a supercharger or turbocharger would do wonders for that car, though it might not be something you can do yourself.</p>

<p>Sure it costs but if you kill someone then you’re spending a fair chunk of your life behind bars. Street racing is as bad as drink driving to me, simply because if you’re racing you don’t really have safety of others on your mind.</p>
