    <title>Need help with making a weblclient, with a jarred client! (free webclient)!</title>

    <description>Alright so I plan on just using a weebly.com. Here&#39;s my current site, it&#39;s plain, but that&#39;s because I&#39;m waiting until I figure out how to get a webclient running on it. Alright so, I&#39;m using the source named Vistex, so credits to him, but I did change stuff around so it&#39;s not the same thing as his server. If you&#39;re needing to know whether it&#39;s a 317 or 508 and what not, I want you to go to http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,541502.msg3966744.html#msg3966744
because I honestly can&#39;t figure out if it&#39;s 508 or not, I know it has 508 maps though. I do have the JARMaker and stuff, and I was following a tutorial on it, but he explained to find stuff in certain .java files and I couldn&#39;t find it, idk if it&#39;s because I may be on a different kind of server or what. But I just need someone to go through it with me. You can skype if you want, but I don&#39;t have a working mic. iamjmperry   Or maybe send me to a link that you know would work. thanks</description>
