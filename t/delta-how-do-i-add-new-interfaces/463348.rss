    <title>[Delta] How do I add new interfaces?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-how-do-i-add-new-interfaces/463348</link>
    <description>I spent most of yesterday trying to figure this problem out, and I don&#39;t want to spend all of today doing the same. I figured I&#39;ll just ask someone that has experience with this subject, as they&#39;ll probably know. I&#39;m wanting to change the sidebar interface, and make the skills tab look different. I know what to do server-sided and adding setSidebarInterface(); and all of that. But how do I create a new interface and add it to the client? This is a Delta, and RSInterfaces.java isn&#39;t included in any of my client files. Also, which interface editor/creator would you recommend?</description>

<p>This is client sided by the way, maybe a higher chance of replies. I’d also try PM’ing people, no one of intelligence really posts in this section anymore, they do every once and a while though, maybe you will get lucky.</p>
