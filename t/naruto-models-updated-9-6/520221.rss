              <p>you cant except that your wrong. i Am 100 percent sure loris did not make the model. By the way your talking its because loris uploaded it that is why you are saying he made it. By that standard i could uploade all of jagex models on a website and you would think i made it?</p>

well i do, loris made them and you are not loris. and i am not attacking you or something i am just telling you its not your model and that i am dissapointed that its not your model and that you aint giving credits whats a rule on their website.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>if you you actually know that that the models are made by a group of modelers from deviant art. yes loris is part of that group at the same time so am i. another member was trying to get into the rsps scene hence why at the beginning of my post i said i made these for a friend. he never took a like to rsps thats why i stoped updating the post. so you really dont know what your talking about. i really dont why im explaining myself to you. lol you dont even know me.[/quote]</p>
<p>look and listen i dont say your not the part of the group i also dont say you are bad all i say is that madara is from loris and not u. and if you are from the group then you would also know to give loris the credits and u maby 5% for editing it to rsps and 100% animation? and i know what i am talking about else i would not know that loris made it and i know its made by deviant groups and by vegeta etc. for the last time i only said that you didn’t made that model. gosh sorry for you that you don’t understand me i have sympathy with you -.-… and you made them for your friend no u did edit? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> just read makes live simple</p>

Do some research if you think this is the only model forum or site im on then you dont know that the models on that site are a contribution of modelers including myself. so if i use a model that i contributed in remaking and convert to edit, and animate for rsps, is the rsps version not mine?</p>

              <p>[quote=“rip4d, post:57, topic:520221”]It bugs me how the only remotely recent posts you’ve made here were basically just advertising this project/community of yours.[/quote]Yeah I know, I’ve been too busy lately to be active on moparscape lately. But I got bored and remembered the time I used to spend on the model section, so I thought why not make a visit. That is when I came across this topic with these awesome models, and I need someone like the OP for my project, so I made a reply here. The post I made here was only meant for poopler, it was not meant as advertisement. I didn’t know how his PM box was doing so I had to post here (with info about the project) to be sure he got the message. The other posts you’re referring to were made in a topic I created at the launch of the project in the “Talk about other games” board to attract some people. I don’t see how any of this could possibly bug some random guy.</p>
<p>[quote=“sk8rdude461, post:56, topic:520221”]I don’t like how your intro is like 30 seconds of “bla bla bla I made this”<br>
Also, the sprinting is nasty…[/quote]That’s too bad. It would be superficial to just show random game-play without any explanation of what it’s about, that is why an intro (especially for the first video of a project) is necessary.</p>
<p>I know the sprinting isn’t what it should be, but animating a placeholder character isn’t a priority right now.</p>
