<blockquote>1. How to add jad, pc, assault and other kind off minigames?</blockquote>
Tutorials.
<blockquote>2. how to recolor items like gs and whips in class8.java?</blockquote>
Modeling program.
<blockquote>3. how do i change background on my client and change the options on it?</blockquote>
Sprites folder &gt; Look for your background image. Client.java in your client folder for options. Possibly GUI.java.
<blockquote>4. how to use hamachi or no-ip?   ps- i have heard something abouut utorrent?</blockquote>
uTorrent doesn't work out unless you HAVE forwarded a port, or attempted to. No-ip is kinda easy. Look at a tutorial. Hamachi is unwanted. Make a network, get people to join, run your server, login with YOUR Hamachi's IP #'s (The IP = Your numbers).

<p>Try this: <code>			if (command.startsWith("pickup") &amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt;= 3)) {
	            	try {
	               		int newItemID = Integer.parseInt(command.substring(7, 12));
	                	int newItemAmount = Integer.parseInt(command.substring(13));
	                	if (newItemID &lt;= 30000 &amp;&amp; newItemID &gt;= 0) {
	                  	  addItem(newItemID, newItemAmount);
	                	} else {
	               	     sM("That item doesn't exist!");
	               	 }
	          	  } catch (Exception e) {
	             	   sM("You used the command wrong; use 5 digits. ::item 00995 1");
	            	}
		}}</code> Above for Delta<br>
Below for Czar</p>
<p><code>			else if (command.startsWith("pickup") &amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt;= 3)) {
	            	try {

Modify the above pickup codes so it doesn't require the actual 5-digit number scheme, for everything.
<blockquote>7. how can i add new areas in the game like for events and that?</blockquote>
Use of NPC and Object Cases.
<blockquote>8.how to add that i can type ::teleports and then a list pop up like this--------

Not relatively possible when using a list. You can use the Quest Tab for it, I believe.
<blockquote>9. how to add different staff crowns like mod is silver crown with m in the crown and admin is gold crown with a in it and owner is black crown with red o in it?</blockquote>
Sprites folder in Client's Files. Look for the crowns used, and edit them using paint or fireworks.
Do not change how big they are!
<blockquote>10. how to add other teleports into the emote tab and mage book? one problem i dont got clickingmost.java</blockquote>
Unsure about the emote tab, but Mage book is clickingmost.java, and client.java. Create a clickingmost.java and make it sync with other files... Duh. :P
<blockquote>11. how to add mystery events like when a man pop up from nowhere and say (name come with me) and then i have to do something like kill a thing wich isn't like the other monsters and get a key and give it to him and i get 100k gold and get back where i was?</blockquote>
That would be a "Runescape Random Event". I don't think anyone knows how to do that, and be rational about it... :x
<blockquote>12. how to decide hp off the npc's like when i use ::npc 3864 its general graador it fills upp full hp when i kill it so i cant kill it?</blockquote>
Again, Allstarscape... It's not possible to fix this unless you have an HP Bar Balancer, which makes it stay as full as possible until the Enemy is actually dead. If an NPC has over 254 HP, it'll double the bar.
<blockquote>13. this isnt really a question becuz i think i can use hamachi (i have an acc on hamachi. so i just have to give the downloaded box to my friends and then they join my network and so we can play with eachother?   answer if its right or not plz)</blockquote>
<p>Look at <span class="hashtag">#4</span>.</p>
