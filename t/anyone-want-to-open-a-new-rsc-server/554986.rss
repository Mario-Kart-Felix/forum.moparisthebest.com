    <title>Anyone want to open a new RSC Server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-want-to-open-a-new-rsc-server/554986</link>
    <description>I would like to run a RSC Server with someone talented and motivated. The server will be a Replica to start off with, updates/customs to improve it will depend on what the community votes for. Server will be for Skillers, Stakers and PKers, All-in-one. The financial side of the server will be handled by myself.

I would like this Server to hold lots of events everyday for all levels, so everyone can get in on the action, there should be at least one level 3 event everyday so everyone can participate, rewards will be different, some events will have a Cash prize as a reward paid through PayPal.

The economy will be balanced as this is a All-in-one server. All rares/in game items will NOT be sold for money, and neither will there be a drop rate increase for subscribers. This way everyone has a fair chance to gain items and make money the correct way.

Name: TBC
XP Rate: Around 5-10x (TBC)
Type: All-in-one. Similar to RSC with community voted updates/customs.

This server has financial backing by myself, so the players do not have to worry about it shutting down after a month.

PM Me if you&#39;re interested.</description>

              <p>How would you stop people circumventing it when they have complete control on their end?</p>
<p>By the way, I had an idea yesterday re: DDoS prevention/mitigation. What if you hosted the server in the cloud (e.g.: using Microsoft Azure) and made the server only available to other servers behind Microsoft’s firewalls?<br>
Then you get people to pay for their own VM on Azure, install a proxy server on it, and access the game that way?</p>
<p>You could have a few people per proxy VM, and those people share the cost (it’d probably work out less than $2/month each). The game server is DDoS protected by virtue of only being accessible from within the Microsoft Azure network.</p>

<p>You should create a small article in Programming about UDP and mechanisms to make that work, I’d love to give it a read <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

That’s one way. Another way is to distinguish between ‘messages’ and ‘packets’. One packet might contain n messages.<br>
The receiving end then ACKs the messages received using a bitfield (so each message is ACK’d 33 times).</p>
<p>Why do this? Because messages that don’t need to arrive don’t have to be re-sent if they aren’t ACK’d; you just fire and forget (e.g.: teleport bubbles, skilling bubbles, etc).</p>

              <p>my vision of a rsc bitcoin server would be pvp centric, gold would represent bitcoins and could be freely exchanged for every gold ingame would be bitcoin sent to the server. and can equally be withdrawn.</p>
<p>obviously the main objective would be to pk other players and earn their loot as it has a real world value.</p>
<p>basically stork pk meets second life. due to bitcoins ability to go to the 8th decimal place you could make items worth fraction of a cent to keep the real world risk low and still enjoyable. Just a little spice to make the standard pk server a little less “boring”</p>
<p>skilling can be for those who don’t want to throw money into the game for example pkers would still need food and if they didn’t desire fish for themselves they could purchase from other players gold (bitcoins). items may be earned in the usual methods (weaposn and armor would degrade if earned freely) but only those that had been purchased for bitcoin can be sold for gold to exchange back to bitcoin.</p>
<p>Obviously balancing between free and paid would be the hard part of bringing such a server to life, the server would probably also need to find a way to support incoming new players by giving them x coins for free to get players going. possibly with advertising. You could even support such effects with one of those app offer walls that they have for mobile gaming platforms.</p>
<p>Only downside I really see to it is that bitcoins transaction fee’s are a little hefty these days however litecoin or another altcoin could be more suitable for such a project.</p>
