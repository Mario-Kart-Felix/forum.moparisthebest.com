Trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXI3obHfwgU

The latest from Joss Whedon and company, penned during the WGA strike and distributed on the internet to avoid the union issues. This is the tale of a low-rent supervillain (Neal Patrick Harris) who&#39;s trying to get into the Evil League of Evil and defeat his nemesis, Captain Hammer (Nathan Fillion) and work up the nerve to talk to the pretty girl at the laundromat (Felicia Day) - in the form of a musical. It&#39;s only free until midnight tomorrow (July 20), so if you haven&#39;t seen it yet, take half an hour and watch it now. 

After Sunday, it will be available as an iTunes download and on a DVD full of extras. This is original, hilarious, studio-independent (yet professional) content produced for the internet. So watch it, laugh, and buy a DVD when they come out - support this kind of thing!</description>
