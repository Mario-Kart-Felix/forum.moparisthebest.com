    <title>Website Idea&#39;s?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/website-ideas/478888</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

My dad asked me to make him a website, because he recently got into photographical stuff. I was like &#39;sure&#39;, but now I need help on the design. I am completely out of idea&#39;s. He just wants it to be clean, but yet professional and attracting.

If you got any idea&#39;s or such, please post. I need to get this done quickly. Also, if you could, please show an example or something, just with Paint or w/e. 

Example of a website he quite liked: http://www.circlepics.nl/

Thanks alot if you bring me some idea&#39;s!</description>

Use entirely CSS for styling, radius, borders etc, you can achieve a pretty nice layout by just fooling around with that, and it keeps it simple. Some form of news script in the center with a three column layout below wouldn’t be a bad thing to take a look at. With professional there’s not a lot of flashy sites involved, keep a two or maybe three tone colour scheme and limit the “funkiness” involved in the banner.</p>
<p>Or yes, use WordPress lol.[/quote]<br>
Yeah, I didn’t plan on using any GFX work, since I’m not good at it and I want it to be handmade :P. I am using CSS for all the stying. I accept my dads request simply because I could probaly learn from it. A 3 column layout should’ve work well, I’ll play around with it!</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestions.</p>
<p>P.S. WordPress is not an option, want to do it myself, from scratch :P.</p>
