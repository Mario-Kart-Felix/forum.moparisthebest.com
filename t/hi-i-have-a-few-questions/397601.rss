    <title>Hi, I have a few question&#39;s</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hi-i-have-a-few-questions/397601</link>
    <description>First off, my first question is.. How do I change the COLOR text, I am using pur3pkftw&#39;s client, and it has glow3:wave:(player&#39;s txt) and I would like to know how to take that out.

Secondly, using pur3pkftw&#39;s client again, when i click on the scroll arrows up and down on the chat box, its like an inch off, how would i fix it? Please no flaming, advice and help, links also is what im looking for! Thankss!</description>
