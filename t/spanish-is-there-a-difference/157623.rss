    <title>[Spanish] Is there a difference?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/spanish-is-there-a-difference/157623</link>
    <description>Using the word for &#39;new&#39;, nuevo, is there a difference between saying something like &quot;Nueva coche&quot; vs &quot;Coche nueva&quot;? They both translate to &quot;New car&quot;, but doesn&#39;t one mean that it&#39;s literally a new car and the other means that it was a recently acquired car, but not necessarily new, just new to the owner?</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Coche nuevo (it’s masculine… why would you say nueva?) means “a brand new car.”<br>
Nuevo coche means “a new (different) car.”</p>
<p>Generally if an adjective follows a noun, it takes it’s normal meaning.  If it precedes the noun, it takes on an alternate meaning.</p>
<p>For example.  If I switched piano teachers, and I were to tell my friend about it, I’d say something like, “I got a nueva profesora.”  However, if I wanted to say that my teacher was inexperienced, I’d say, “I got a profesora nueva.”</p>

<p>I think the adjective usually goes last, but I’ve definitely seen Nueva used before and after the noun, so I’m wondering if someone was just fail and put it in the wrong place or if there’s really a difference.</p>
