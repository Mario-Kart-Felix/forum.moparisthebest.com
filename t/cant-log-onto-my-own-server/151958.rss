    <title>Can&#39;t Log Onto My Own Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-log-onto-my-own-server/151958</link>
    <description>Normally, I type in my User and pass, then I leave my IP thing blank cause I&#39;m running the server from my computer. So my runserver.bat is up and I try to log in, but when I press &#39;login&#39; It just freezes saying &quot;connecting to server&quot;. Then after 30 seconds, it says &quot;server must be down&quot; I know its not don cause I&#39;m running it. I&#39;ve been able to use my server for 3 months and now suddenly this morning this happens.  

Help? All I need to know is which file is messed up and I can fix it.  (My compiler doesn&#39;t say anything unusual btw)

Thanks
