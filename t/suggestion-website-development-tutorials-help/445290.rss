    <title>Suggestion: Website Development/Tutorials/Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/suggestion-website-development-tutorials-help/445290</link>
    <description>Unfortunately I just typed out this whole topic and I lost it so this will be brief until I edit it and add more information and points back into it as I remember them.

Anyway, Most servers have websites that include features such as forums. People are often looking to improve their websites look, functionality, and purpose. Even though websites are a large part of most servers, there is not an area for them on MoparScape. I&#39;m sure most people would find great help in being able to get help and assistance with their website, and also show off some of their development as they go.

Currently there is no proper place to release websites or get help with them as I mentioned. I feel it would be a great addition to add websites into moparscape since they play such a key role in most servers.

Here is my idea, add an entire category for just websites. This is just my outlook on a way to do this but it could be done in just a board too.

-Category: Websites
-Board 1: Website Help
-Board 2: Website Tutorials
-Board 3: Website Development
-Board 4: Website Downloads</description>

              <p>This is the fourth or fifth request for website boards. I’ll repeat myself again. It’s not needed because there is already a website board on Moparisthebest. If people here don’t want to use that, they can use a combination of General Programming, General Discussion, and General Questions.</p>
