    <description>Rsc you have to have your connections set both on your client side and server side... as i am looking at these rs2 server sides i cant seem to find any kind of connection settings here..so my guess is that server side doesnt need your ip to be configured in, just the client side?</description>

              <p>Okay listen up.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The IP Address that the client should connect to should be programmed into the client. Doing this, you must find “Applet_sub1.java” and “client.java” in an rs2 client. The code can be changed, or added in those files so the client will know which IP the client will connect to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will connect to the server, until it reaches the update server. Once it’s reached the update server, then it will know which deob the server is (ex: 317, or 508), if the deob is not the same as the client, then the client will will reach 2% on the loading screen and will no longer load but crash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the server’s deob is the same as the client, then the client will load, bringing you to the login screen for you to input a username and password.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you log in with a valid username or password, then the server will read the data being sent to the server, such as Connection IP, deob type, login type, and ecryption keys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the ecryption keys, deob, and login type are satisfactory, then the player will then be successfully logged into the server.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s how connecting to a rs2-base server would be. For RSC however, the IP is programmed into the client, but must be accepted as a valid ip on the server. This is for security purposes for if someoone hacks their client, it would only be possible to connect to their server instead of others.</p>

<p>And…The client don’t, and can’t, tell the server which IP the client should connect to. Instead, the IP is coded into the client it’self. All servers should have basic java imports to them, making it possible for the server’s socket (The server network) read what the localhost IP is which can be (127.0.0.1), or (0.0.0.0). You can’t program code using a client into a server. Instead the code it’self must be programmed into the client and the server must be configured, withOUT using the client to read what the settings are.[/quote]<br>

              <p>so give me an example of how someone connects then. I just dont understand how the client side could tell the server side to change the ip… i mean its localhost when u download it, how does the client change it so that people can globaly connect? So confusing to me, classic its very basic and straight to the point.</p>
