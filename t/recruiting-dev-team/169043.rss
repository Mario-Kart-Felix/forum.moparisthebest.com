    <description>Hi, i was creating my server Ghost-pkz and i noticed how easy it is for ppl to leach sources... and how im tired of seeing noob leeched sources all over moparscape. I thought to my self y dont i create a master moparscape source that im not going to release or anything. I am planning on coding this for about 2-3 months atm. I would like this to bee a  server but i want the real stats for silab items..I will need about 5-7 coders because itas hard to code soemthing by yourslef. Some graphic designers. Client creaters... and more. ALL ppl who apply will need



[center][u]Things i plan to do[/u][/center]
I am planning on adding about 2-3 pk boxes. Some admin commands special items. A Marketshop place where ppl can go and sell items. Shopz (with about every item in moparscape.
Tons of places(will edit teleports to go to them all), adding membership/membership areas. special specs, 100% runecraft,slayr,theif

[center][u]Things ill need help with.[/u][/center]
I will need help with adding a announcement box. Moderating places/pking. Making certain commands worlk for certaint ppl. Making ::pickup work for all admins.(for some reson i can only get it to work for owner and its player rights 2... makeing a ::mem command that will give membership, making it so ppl have to register to get on. Block all cheat clients (azn,slyz,ect..) Adding d-bow minigame(that you need to be certain lvl to do), torso minigame (certain lvl to do), Skillcapes with cool emotes, Working specs (like the real ones on rs. and alot more.
