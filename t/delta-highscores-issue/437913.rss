    <title>[Delta] Highscores issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-highscores-issue/437913</link>
    <description>I&#39;m helping my friend add highscores to his delta server (oh goody :P) and I&#39;ve come across one error. It won&#39;t connect to the database. Honestly I think that I made a mistake here. I&#39;m using x10hosting for the database by the way.

[code]			con = DriverManager.getConnection(&quot;jdbc:mysql://localhost/rainbo57_high&quot;,&quot;rainbo57_admin&quot;,&quot;pass protected.&quot;);
[/code]

I&#39;m having an issue with localhost. I set the database on the mysql.php (for the actual highscores page) to localhost and no errors came back on that. But when I set the server to localhost it cannot connect. I&#39;ve also tried setting it to my IP address(IPv4), my house ip (the one comcast gave my house), and the server IP that x10hosting has apparently. None of these are working. rainbo57_admin has all privileges on MySQL database rainbo57_high.

Solutions?</description>
