    <description>This tutorial will show you how to prevent the death of a player when they first connect to the server (before there user file etc. has been created).

1) First of all open your [i]client.java[/i] file.

2) Search for the following:

[code]PlayerSave loadgame = loadMythgame(playerName, playerPass);[/code]

Below that you should see an if statement that begins:

[code]if (loadgame != null) {[/code]

Find the end of this if statement. It will look something similar to this:

[code]	playerLevel = loadgame.playerLevel;
	playerXP = loadgame.playerXP;
	// PlayerHandler.messageToAll =
	// playerName+&quot;: has logged in! There is now &quot;+PlayerHandler.getPlayerCount()
	// + &quot; players.&quot;;
}[/code]

Once you have found the end of the if statement. Add the following code directly after it:

[code]else {
	currentHealth = 10;
	NewHP = 10;
	playerLevel[playerHitpoints] = 10;
}[/code]

The end of the if will now look similar to this:

[code]	playerXP = loadgame.playerXP;
	// PlayerHandler.messageToAll =
	// playerName+&quot;: has logged in! There is now &quot;+PlayerHandler.getPlayerCount()
	// + &quot; players.&quot;;
} else {
	currentHealth = 10;
	NewHP = 10;
	playerLevel[playerHitpoints] = 10;
}[/code]


[b]Explanation:[/b] When loading the server attempts to load the data of the player (e.g. their level, health etc.) from a file. If this file is not found and the loading fails, the loadMythgame function returns null. The if that we have just added to checks for this. If it is not null, the health and other skills are loaded and checked. Although, if it is null, nothing is done to ensure that the health of the player is set. Once this happens, a check to see if the health is 0 (player death) is run - the player is then made to die. We prevent this by setting the health of the player if the player&#39;s information failed to load (loadMythgame returns null).</description>
