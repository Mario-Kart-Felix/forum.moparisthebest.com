I am also having the problem to not being able to connect to my server when its up (Its still blank when i try to connect) Farest it gets to is `Connecting to game server...` This is a 525 Source if somebody can help me, that will be great!  :eek: I am also looking for a coder who can work with me, i have a VPS already, i may get a .com/org/net not sure yet but considering.
