    <title>Pk Point Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pk-point-problem/319178</link>
    <description>Well, I made pk-armor fairly hard to get, but when I logged into my server today, literally every player had full vesta/statius. I would like to know how to disallow players from earning pk points from the same player more then once when you defeat them, I&#39;ve tried researching, but haven&#39;t found it.</description>
