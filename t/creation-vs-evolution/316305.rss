              <p>A better debate would be what makes religions so stuck on an idea that they completely abolish all other possibilities. As moparisthebest said earlier, they can coexist. Nearly anything is possible if each “Book” says that they’re right if you follow common logic. If you think your right, your right; if you think you’re wrong, you’re right.</p>

<p>I believe in both. We were created from something, but everything over time has evolved from whatever we started from.[/quote]</p>
<p>Deoxyribonucleic acid, show that we could have evolved from apes as were have very similar DNA paterns and we also share some of that with the DNA stucture of a banana.</p>

eveltion says we were monkeys ow thats stupid[/quote]So you don’t believe in something just because you don’t want to think of the possibility that we were once as dumb as apes? When you’re an adult will it also be a fact that you don’t want to believe that you were once a child, immature and dumb?</p>
<p>I believe in both. We were created from something, but everything over time has evolved from whatever we started from.</p>

<p>So if someone made up a book that had random shit in it about what happens when you enter a black hole, you would believe it because it gives some explanation?</p>
<p>I believe a group of people designed the bible. They had to be fairly smart because there is defiantly a lot of scientific observations such as letting your land rest every seven years, but going into if you sin then you get sent to a eternal death is bullshit.</p>
<p>Spoiler: God’s not real.</p>
