    <title>One item per character</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/one-item-per-character/310459</link>
    <description>Okay, after following meiscooldudes tutorial on lists, I had a go at doing this, but I did it a little differently.

I wanted a weapon that you can only have on of at any time, and so I added this into my client.java.

[code]if (playerHasItemAmount(747, 2)) {
			sendMessage(&quot;You can only have one of those!&quot;);
			deleteItem(747, GetItemSlot(747), 1);
		}
		else {
			setEquipment(playerEquipment[playerWeapon], 1, playerWeapon);
[/code]

Now this worked. I had one in my inventory, did :: pickup 00747 1, it send a message, you can only have one of those, and then it deleted the old one and added the new one, so I still had 1. This also worked if I opened my bank if it had one in. The problem now is that whenever I try and get one again, I cant. I dont have one in my bank or invent, but It still send the message and deltes it.

Now, my next idea was to import the List and ArrayList into my client.java, and put this.


This is off the top of my head btw :P
[code]
List HasItem = new ArrayList(); //makes new List

if (playerHasItemAmount(747, 1)) { //if player has one of these items, adds their username to list.
HasItem.add(+ playername +);
}
if (HasItem.contains(+ playername +)) { //if playername is on the list, then it deletes this weapon.
   deleteItem(747, getItemSlot(747) ,1);
}
else if (playerHasItemAmount(747, 0)) { //if player doesent have one, deletes their name from list.
HasItem.remove(+ playername +);
}
[/code]</description>

I dunno.</p>
<p><code>
int allowed = 0;
public void allowedcheck() {
if(allowed == 0){
addItem(747, 1);
allowed = 1;
savegame(true);
}
} else {
if(allowed == 1){
sendMessage("Already allowed.");
return false;
}
}</code></p>
<p>Basically you should get the idea.</p>
