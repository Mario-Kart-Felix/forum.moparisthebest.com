    <title>Pi Soul split Base need help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-soul-split-base-need-help/460603</link>
    <description>Okay, I got this unusual problem, basically I tried to add command for my server to called cash out, it&#39;s a command for you to transfer tickets to cash.

When I added the command I compiled and saved it, but then most of the other commands stopped working.

I did have the same problem earlier, I tried adding hail command for my server, it worked but the item command stopped working.

It is very unusual and if you have the solution for it then please tell me.</description>
