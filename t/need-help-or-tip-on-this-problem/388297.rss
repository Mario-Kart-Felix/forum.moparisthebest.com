    <description>Okay, yesterday i created my first server, me and my friends were able to log on and we were playing, after playing all day i shut down my pc. when i woke up, i started my pc: open the no-ip program, opened my source, then started my client. now it wont let me connect to my server again. im putting in the same info for the server ip and port as yesterday too. it seems to work when i put in 0.0.0.0 as the ip, but im trying to get my ip working in there like yesterday. am i missing a step?</description>
