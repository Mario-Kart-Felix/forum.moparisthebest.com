    <title>Random fires on client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/random-fires-on-client/347704</link>
    <description>Well, my client has done this for as long as I can remember and I will be releasing my server to the public soon. The easiest way to put this is that there is random fires on the side of my client. I&#39;m more of a server coder so I don&#39;t know what to do. If anyone could help, it would be awesome.
