    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hoster-looking-for-a-rsps-coder-hoster/432820</link>
    <description>Hello my name is Jason and i am looking for a RSPS Coder
Iv been hosting a Minecraft server for over 6 months with over 30+ People online at once with 0 lag. 
I had to close my Minecraft server for personal reasons. 
I had a server awhile back with over 40+ active members.
I want to get back into the RSPS life.
I have 8.00GB of ram installed on my computer. 
My computer is left on 24/7 so there will be no downtime.
I&#39;m in need of a coder because i have no idea how to code (Co-Owner)
We have a Web Designer and a advertiser. Now looking for a coder.
I&#39;m 17 and out of school so i can be reached anytime.
Please Post on this thread or Skype me for more instant response.
