    <title>Has this been done? Is it possible? Player owned shops</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/has-this-been-done-is-it-possible-player-owned-shops/201175</link>
    <description>I was thinking of Player owned shops. Like you would type ::myshop and then a blank shop would open up, and then you could place your items into that shop, and the close it and it would save. Then, another player could type ::shop playername ( a player&#39;s name ) And it would open up that shop. They could buy stuff from taht shop, and the other player would get the money put into there bank.
I have a good idea on how to do this ( Im not inexpereicned, i do know alot of stuff ) But i have a couple questions.
1. Has this been done before?
2. If not, is it possible?
3. Would it be client side as well
Thanks</description>
