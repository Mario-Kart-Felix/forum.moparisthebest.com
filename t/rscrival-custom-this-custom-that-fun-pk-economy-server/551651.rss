    <title>RscRival (Custom this, Custom that, Fun PK/Economy server)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rscrival-custom-this-custom-that-fun-pk-economy-server/551651</link>
    <description>[center][url=http://rscrival.com/][img]http://rscrival.com/images/bx.png[/img][/url][/center]

Rsc Rival is a server designed to try and bring back the thrill of old school PK/Dueling with updates that add new content, rates that allow for fairly easy skill training, but still give the accomplishment of gaining the max level in a skill. It is fairly easy to gain Vanilla RSC items, but quite difficult to collect the new weapon and armor sets, making them valuable risks if you dare take them into the wilderness, or stake them in a duel.

There are Custom weapons, armor, food items, herbs, gems, wood, maps, arrows, ores, skills, and many more to come. You may recognize many features of the old server, I hope in time things will build from what has already been added to the source, current plans are adding pets, an auction house, and a &#39;bounty&#39; system that will grant bonuses for killing a player target. Other future updates include &#39;barrows&#39; minigame, key collection minigames, possibly new skills, clue scrolls, a custom wilderness island, and many more.

Note: This isn&#39;t a clone/theft server, I did a fair proportion of the new content that was developed for this source, and plan to add more features and content in the future. I have permission from the previous owner to continue the project since he has a life now and doesn&#39;t have time to code for RSC.

Since Virtually No-one posts or views this forum anymore, I highly encourage you to tell your friends to give the server a try.

Edit:

              <p>The server isn’t a slow xp grind, most of the servers that are sell subscriptions to give higher xp rates. We have stats over 99, so the XP rates needed to rise, otherwise 30/40 would have been perfect for maxing skills.</p>
<p>There is no subscriber status atm, if we did add sub in the future it would be a negligible difference, (maybe 110/130 for combat/skilling instead of 100/120) The only time we’d add sub is if the server grew too large for the current host, and we’d need to upgrade.</p>
<p>We’re still making small, daily tweaks, fixing issues, working on new content. The server is designed for having fun, not making money.</p>

<p>If I recall original reloaded was even higher rates, it’s fine the way it is don’t listen to the no life low xp nerds that want to grind nonstop for months on end. Even at 100x rates 120 is going to take a while when you can’t be on 24/7.</p>

<p>Try getting 120 prayer, or firemaking, then tell me the exp rate is too high.</p>
<p>There are separate rates for combat and skilling too, might end up being 120x skilling 80x combat, since you can afk train most combat skills. (magic and range being the exception)</p>
<p>Slowly raising it till the rates seem right, it shouldnt take a month to get 120, but it shouldnt take a day either.</p>

<p>Rsc Rival is a server designed to try and bring back the thrill of old school PK/Dueling with updates that add new content, rates that allow for fairly easy skill training, but still give the accomplishment of gaining the max level in a skill. It is fairly easy to gain Vanilla RSC items, but quite difficult to collect the new weapon and armor sets, making them valuable risks if you dare take them into the wilderness, or stake them in a duel.</p>
<p>There are Custom weapons, armor, food items, herbs, gems, wood, maps, arrows, ores, skills, and many more to come. You may recognize many features of the old server, I hope in time things will build from what has already been added to the source, current plans are adding pets, an auction house, and a ‘bounty’ system that will grant bonuses for killing a player target. Other future updates include ‘barrows’ minigame, key collection minigames, possibly new skills, clue scrolls, a custom wilderness island, and many more.</p>

<p>Note: This isn’t a clone/theft server, I did a fair proportion of the new content that was developed for this source, and plan to add more features and content in the future. I have permission from the previous owner to continue the project since he has a life now and doesn’t have time to code for RSC.</p>
<p>Since Virtually No-one posts or views this forum anymore, I highly encourage you to tell your friends to give the server a try.</p>
