    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-questions-really-need-some-help-with-this-delta-317-will-rep/374840</link>
    <description>Im using delta 317,just need some help with this,im learning to code,so any help is appreciated.

1.I need a shop to accept champion tokens,how do i do this?I need it so when you sell,you get coins back.
2.I need to have voting for cash,i use smfforfree.com tho,thus i dont understand any of the tutorial already made.
3.sometimes it says &#39;data transfer timeout&#39; on my cmd,also it does this occasionaly.

4.If possible,i need it so you click &#39;join clan&#39; to join one,and clan setup to change the ranks,basically i need full clanchat.If i cant get that,could i at least use slash to talk in clan,cus i got the basic ::ccjoin atm.
5. I need a command to reset my slayer task.
6.i need a ::vote and ::forums command
7.How do i make a command where a player does like ::Reqstaff,and it sends it to a staff member online saying they need help,but it changes staff member,rather than the same one all the time.If there is no one on,i need it 2 say,no staff members are available at the moment,please post on the forums.
8.Also,i need ::yell and ::bank for donators,but i dont want ::bank in the wildy.
9.I need proper smithing,atm it gives money.I made a previous post about it here:
