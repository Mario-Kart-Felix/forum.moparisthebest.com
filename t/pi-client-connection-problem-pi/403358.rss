    <description>Whenever I open the client of my server it automatically closes after this error:
[IMG]http://i51.tinypic.com/1z5nj0o.jpg[/img]

This occurred randomly after working just fine and it affects only some players. But it affects me (the host) and also other players. I&#39;m not sure if this should be server sided because I tried making a new client and the same thing happened, but also, when I tried running an old version of my server, and the error again. Is it my Java or something? Please help!</description>

Create it using <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a> and if you already did and it’s not working, you need to either portforward (or maybe again) or update your host, they expire.</p>
