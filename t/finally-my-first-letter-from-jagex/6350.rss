    <description>Please keep quiet about this until I get a response:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hello from Jagex,

game RuneScape (www.RuneScape.com).

I have discovered that your website at         http://www.moparisthebest.com

The site also offers access to information that encourages your members

From thier wording, like &quot;undertakes or facilitates&quot; and &quot;encourages&quot; I think they are trying to call my bluff, there is nothing illegal on this server that I know of.

What do you guys think?</description>

<p>I think they meant that people are trading scripts for RS2 Gold and that is violating one of their rules stating “You can’t trade your stuff for real life stuff.” That’s my best guess.

          <blockquote>
              <p>I finally found the time to make a point by point counter to thier email and send it to them, here it is for your viewing pleasure:</p>
<blockquote>I act for moparisthebest.com, As you may or may not know I have worked as a cashier at a grocery store since 2002, In my limited free time I run a website whose forums have no more than 1000 active members, divide that by your claimed 4.1 million active runescape players and you get the percentage of 0.02349% of your userbase, subtract the large portion of the members such as myself who have not played runescape for over a year and you see how many are left.  My turnover last financial year to march 2005 was in excess of $2000 dollars, all of which went to my living expenses. If I liquidated all of my assets, which consists of a 1989 Chevrolet S10, my net worth would be around $1000 dollars.
<p>I own the name moparisthebest, I fail to see how this infringes on any trademark that you own, please correct me if I am mistaken.</p>
<p>I don’t know what you are refferring to about having contact with me previously, because I have never recieved nor sent an email from adlexsolicitors in the past.</p>
<p>My website does have programs that either my members or I have written.  Most of these programs are released open source under the gnu/gpl license and frankly are none of your business.  The fact that some of these programs can be used for multiple purposes, one being to cheat on runescape, is complelly irrelevant.</p>
<p>As to anyone “using your client’s site to effect these transactions” I have no idea what that means.  My site has very explicit rules against any and all selling or trading of runescape characters and items.  I simply do not allow it.  Next time do your homework first before making false accusations.</p>
<p>I have never “tortiously induced” anything, whether your clients break thier contracts with you is bewtween you and them, leave me out of it.</p>
<p>In no way possible could my website be causing your client financial loss, even if your clients cheat on runescape, you already have your monthly fee and they keep the window open and logged in no matter what. Again, let me emphasize that I have nothing to do with your clients decision to cheat or not.</p>
<p>I don’t use your clients site, therefore I am not infringing on anything belonging to them.  However, if you or your client use my site, you are breaking the contract anyone must agree to in order to use my site, also note that I record the IP address of anyone who agrees with the contract. I have never disputed the fact that all runescape characters and items are your clients intellectual property, again, any selling or buying of anything on my forums is expressly prohibited.</p>
<p>Nothing on my site has anything to do with gaining unauthorized access to any computer systems.  I still haven’t the faintest idea what these “transactions” you speak of imply.</p>
<p>I would ask that you point me to the exact United States law that prohibits me from even mentioning the word runescape, I use it in no way for a monetary gain, which I believe is the only way one could use it in an illegal manner.  I don’t use the word runescape in any way differing from that of other communities you support such as tip.it and <a href="http://runehq.com" rel="nofollow noopener">runehq.com</a>.</p>
<p>Please cease all ignorant, unfounded accusations within 7 days from today.</p>
<p>As a side note, I have not played runescape or used your clients website within the last year or more, well before this website was started.  Also note that I reserve the right to publicly post and/or publish this and all future coorespondence for the public to see.  You may do the same.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully</p>

Maybe I'm just unaware, but what bots are currently being distributed?  The only thing (that I know of) that can ssist with cheating is SCAR, but, as you've stated to them before, its not a bot and is not used exclusively for RS...

You hold an indifferent stance, you do not authorize it :)

Yup, they lose so much money from having some people who actually buy more membersip to auto.

Is cheating illegal?
<p>I dunno, they focused mainly on bots affecting the real RS’s gameplay…but this site primarily focused on private servers which has no affect on the real game…this is getting quite silly really.  So they’re threatening legal actions for you’re promotion of bots and the use of the words runescape?</p>

              <blockquote>Dear Sir
<p><a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a> (“the Website”)</p>
<p>We act for Jagex Limited. As you know our client has owned and operated<br>
RuneScape, the well-known online multiplayer adventure game, at a<br>
website at<br>
<a href="http://runescape.com" rel="nofollow noopener">runescape.com</a> since 2001. There are currently some 4.1 million active<br>
registered players of the game in over 15 countries. Our client’s<br>
turnover<br>
in its last financial year to March 2005 was in excess of £5 million<br>
(approximately $9 million).</p>
<p>Our client owns Community Trade Mark E2942761, UK Trade Mark 2302308<br>
and US<br>
Trade Mark 2829952 for the word RUNESCAPE in classes 16, 25 and 41. Our<br>
client also has common law rights (and/or under company name / unfair<br>
competition law or equivalent) in the name RUNESCAPE deriving from its<br>
extensive use outlined above.</p>
<p>We understand that you are the owner / operator of the Website and have<br>
previously communicated with you regarding the infringements mentioned<br>
below. Your Website infringes our client’s rights as follows:</p>
<p>The Website is being used to facilitate the distribution of software<br>
robots<br>
and / or similar programs (“bots”) for the purpose of cheating (as well<br>
as<br>
related discussion groups).</p>
<p>Clearly you or persons authorised by you have used our client’s site to<br>
effect these transactions and you have thereby become bound by - and<br>
breached - our client’s contract which strictly forbids such<br>
activities.</p>
<p>In any case you have tortiously induced the other parties to break<br>
their<br>
contracts with our client.</p>
<p>These transactions damage the game’s reputation and cause our client<br>
financial loss. Not only do they enable players to advance without<br>
spending<br>
time playing the game (resulting in loss of revenue) but honest players<br>
are<br>
discouraged from playing as a result.</p>
<p>Breaching our client’s contract means that any use by you of our<br>
client’s<br>
site is unlicensed and thereby infringes our client’s intellectual<br>
property<br>
rights in its site. Furthermore our client’s contract confirms that all<br>
RuneScape characters and items are and remain our client’s intellectual<br>
property.</p>
<p>Bots infringe our client’s copyright by copying and modifying our<br>
client’s<br>
software and/or by attempting to circumvent our client’s copyright<br>
protection mechanisms. Bots also constitute a trespass to chattels.</p>
<p>The transactions are criminal offences insofar at they incite, counsel,<br>
procure or assist persons to gain unauthorised access to our client’s<br>
computer systems.</p>
<p>Our client’s trade mark RUNESCAPE is being used on the Website in a<br>
manner<br>
which is not in accordance with honest practices in commercial matters<br>
and<br>
which without due cause takes unfair advantage of, or is detrimental<br>
to, the<br>
distinctive character of the mark. This is trade mark infringement.</p>
<p>We note on that on the Website you admit to cheating on RuneScape this<br>
admission has been captured as evidence and may be used at a later<br>
stage<br>
should it become necessary to do so.</p>
<p>Please cease all activity outlined above within 7 days from today.<br>
Otherwise<br>
our client will have little choice but to initiate formal legal steps<br>
to<br>
protect its position.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully</p>

<p>Now that I refuted thier other claims, they are changing thier complaints to invalid use of the word “runescape” which is total bullshit</p>
