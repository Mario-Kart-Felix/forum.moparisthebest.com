    <description>Hi, I was playing on this one server, but had to get off. Today, i wanted to play it again, but i couldn&#39;t get on. I had the IP, my user and pass all in. Was even on Hamachi. Can someone please tell me if i&#39;m missing something here?</description>

              <p>to see if your fav server is on, try clicking the server status page at the top. all the servers that are on will have green words saying “Server online!” next to them. this is also good for finding new servers, my favorites so far are <a href="http://ruinscape.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">ruinscape.no-ip.org</a>, <a href="http://hybriscape.moparscpae.org" rel="nofollow noopener">hybriscape.moparscpae.org</a>, and <a href="http://thatoneserver.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">thatoneserver.no-ip.org</a></p>
