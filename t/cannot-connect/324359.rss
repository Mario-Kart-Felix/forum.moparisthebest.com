    <title>Cannot connect?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cannot-connect/324359</link>
    <description>Okay well... Once again, here I am in the help section again :(

Hopefully this will be my last question for a while! 

Well I&#39;m using a Deltascape source and some random client with ip changing availability.
Well, I&#39;ve portforwarded 43594 and I&#39;ve change my no-ip domain. I&#39;ve even tried connecting with just my ip...

Nothing works...
So I use localhost to see if Its something that I edited or something, well, I connect easily with localhost. I log out, and I check the server log
and I get this like
[code]localhost:17490[/code]

From what I understand, the ip of a server works like this:  127.0.0.1:43594 / Ipaddress:port

So I THINK I changed the port correctly in &quot;client.java&quot; I compiled, and still to no avail... I can&#39;t connect...

Help would be appreciated, and I&#39;m more than willing to allow remote access with teamviewer.

Thanks,
~Rosie</description>
