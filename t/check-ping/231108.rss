    <title>Check Ping</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/check-ping/231108</link>
    <description>Hi i am having a problem with my server and i was wondering where i may find the player ping.

I am wanting to know this because i fear the ping is above a certain number the players may be automaticly &quot;kicked&quot; from my server. Only some are able to join. Others only see &quot;loading please wait&quot;
and then  they say the only way to describe what happend it that they were kicked.I have looked at the &quot;kicklogs&quot; also that is EMPTY.

If you think you can help please reply.</description>
