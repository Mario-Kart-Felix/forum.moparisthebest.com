    <description>all the tuts i came across so far on the forums are all out dated is it just me or what? i know its a lot of updating but i completely suck with following tuts for the first time if there outdated i feel like i get to the last step to port forward my router and it just doesnt work i cant find my router on the list i feel like my router is just freaking special. 
heres the information:
Name: Belkin AC1200DB Wireless Router
Model	: F9K1113v2 (01)

http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/Belkin/default.htm
my router isn&#39;t listen and i cant find anything similar and i&#39;ve tried the program from the portforward.com website 
F9K1110
F9K1116v1
F9K1117v2
and i have a modem provided through my internet company which is service electric i log into my router settings using 192.168.2.1
