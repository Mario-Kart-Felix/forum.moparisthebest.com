I spent more time with the font on this one. For some reason it looks better when it is on a black background instead of a white one. The by billygotshot part completely ruins it but I had to add it in somewhere.</description>

Well, you failed at that didn't you?

It doesn't go well together with the render.

Is this supposed to make it match? It certainly doesn't.

Use acronyms, like BGS, or just don't put your name on it?
<blockquote>Other then that the only thing I have to say that is wrong is that the right side is way to bright.</blockquote>
You should have fixed that before you posted.

              <p>Can someone show me what perfect is exactly? Because honestly I have no idea what the fuck to make when all is the colors don’t match the font is bad brushing over the focal is wrong brushes are wrong etc. It’s like making it was wrong.</p>
<p>The reason for brushing over the focal is so that she looks like she is leaning on a wall or something. BTW I barely brushed over the focal. The vector brushes were vector/grunge brushes. As for the colors not matching I took every single one from a spot on the render. The text billygotshot is complete shit because my name looks like shit no matter what. Other then that the only thing I have to say that is wrong is that the right side is way to bright.</p>

<p>The “Billygotshot” part of the text ruins it, bad font.</p>
<p>You could just put BGS or some abbreviation of you’re name in a corner with a clipping mask over it to make it less noticeable.</p>
