<p>Paradoxes</p>
<p>Would you believe that this amazing sentence contains ninety two letters, one comma and a single question mark?</p>
<p>Three people check into a hotel. They pay £30 to the manager and go to their room. The manager suddenly remembers that the room rate is £25 and gives £5 to the bellboy to return to the people. On the way to the room the bellboy reasons that £5 would be difficult to share among three people so he pockets £2 and gives £1 to each person. Now each person paid £10 and got back £1. So they paid £9 each, totalling £27. The bellboy has £2, totalling £29. Where is the missing £1?—[size=10pt][size=10pt]solved![/size][/size]</p>
<p>You can imagine an arrow in flight, toward a target. For the arrow to reach the target, the arrow must first travel half of the overall distance from the starting point to the target. Next, the arrow must travel half of the remaining distance.</p>
<p>For example, if the starting distance was 10m, the arrow first travels 5m, then 2.5m.</p>
<p>If you extend this concept further, you can imagine the resulting distances getting smaller and smaller. Will the arrow ever reach the target?</p>
<p>Imagine a prisoner in a prison. He is sentenced to death and has been told that he will be killed on one day of the following week. He has been assured that the day will be a surprise to him, so he will not be anticipating the hangman on a particular day, thus keeping his stress levels in check.</p>
<p>The prisoner starts to think to himself, if I am still alive on Thursday, then clearly I shall be hanged on Friday, this would mean that I then know the day of my death, therefore I cannot be hanged on Friday. Now then, if I am still alive on Wednesday, then clearly I shall be hanged on Thursday, since I have already ruled out Friday. The prisoner works back with this logic, finally concluding that he cannot after all be hanged, without already knowing which day it was.<br>
Casually, resting on his laurels, sitting in his prison cell on Tuesday, the warden arrives to take him to be hanged, the prisoner was obviously surprised!</p>
<p>Brain teasers</p>
<p>During a recent Cluedo weekend, four games were played. In one game Miss Scarlet used the spanner, but not in the library. In another game the rope was used in the study, but not by Colonel Mustard. During one game the gun was used in the conservatory, whilst in another game Professor Plum was not to be found in the library. Colonel Mustard was never in the conservatory and Mrs White never used the rope. The lead piping may or may not have been used in the kitchen. Can you determine who used what and where?</p>
<p>In Mrs. Farstaff’s Science class, they are holding a contest. She has a glass bottle, and a little bronze ball, the size of which is the exact same as the hole in the bottle. Mrs. Farstaff is giving the student who can put the ball in the bottle, without breaking the glass or destroying the ball somehow, an iPOD.</p>
<p>In her room there is a microwave, petroleum jelly, a stove, and a freezer</p>
<p>Six of her seven students attempted this feat, but with no luck.</p>
<p>After the sixth student, the seventh, Geoff, comes up to the bottle and the ball. He thinks of using one of the tools in Mrs. Farstaff’s room at his disposal, and uses one (not the jelly as it was already proven to not work) and five hours later, gets the ball in the bottle and his free iPOD.</p>
<p>How did he do it?</p>
<p>You have just enrolled into a new class called “Wordonometry”. Wordonometry involves adding and subtracting parts of words and using special functions on a word. On the first day of the class, you claim that you are new to the subject, so the teacher goes easy on you. He gives you the definitions of certain key functions that will aid you in today’s warm-up problem:</p>
<p>ant = Change the word into an antonym of its former self. Example: ant(alive) = dead<br>
syn = Change the word into a synonym of its former self. Example: syn(idiosyncratic) = strange<br>
hom = Change the word into a homonym of its former self. Example: hom(straight) = strait<br>
+bgn+ = Add the second word/fragment to the beginning of the first word/segment. Example: lick +bgn+ s = slick<br>
+end+ = Add the second word/fragment to the end of the first word/fragment. Example: rob +end+ in = robin</p>
<p>You can use these functions in any order you need to change words into other words. Can you use the following functions to change HIGHER into THRIVE?</p>
<p>The functions are:</p>
<p>ant(<strong><strong>)<br>
syn(</strong></strong>)<br>
hom(____)<br>
+bgn+ f<br>
+end+ ish</p>
<p>Hint<br>
Use the hom function before using the syn function and after the ant function.</p>
<p>all i have at the moment enjoy.</p>

        <p>No the arrow will never ever ever reach the target. If you can move such a small distance as it would go…</p>
<p>Like… 2.5 / 2 = 1.25 , Its going to eveuntually be all decimals, It would be hard to move that little… but no you will never reach the target.</p>
<p>EDIT: Plus the hotel one.</p>
<p>The room is 30 so he give 5 back. So now the manager has 25 and the Bell boy pockets 2 and gives 1 to each guy. So 25 + 2 + 3 = 30. There is your answer. If you need further explantion then don’t ask me just think about it</p>

        <blockquote>In Mrs. Farstaff's Science class, they are holding a contest. She has a glass bottle, and a little bronze ball, the size of which is the exact same as the hole in the bottle. Mrs. Farstaff is giving the student who can put the ball in the bottle, without breaking the glass or destroying the ball somehow, an iPOD.
<p>In her room there is a microwave, petroleum jelly, a stove, and a freezer</p>
<p>Six of her seven students attempted this feat, but with no luck.</p>
<p>After the sixth student, the seventh, Geoff, comes up to the bottle and the ball. He thinks of using one of the tools in Mrs. Farstaff’s room at his disposal, and uses one (not the jelly as it was already proven to not work) and five hours later, gets the ball in the bottle and his free iPOD.</p>
<p>How did he do it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He got it in because of the freezer. When molecules are cold they move slower, make them smaller. Since when they are hot they move faster and the bonds are less strong causing them to be able to move further apart. Making the object bigger. So he put the bronze ball in the freezer and it made the molecules move slower causing the bonds to be stronger keeping them closer together. Making the object smaller, there is your answer  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>PS: I suggest putting a [ hr] tag between each problem, splitting them apart. Thats confusing the way it is now.</p>
