    <title>1408 -The Review</title>

    <description>Hey,

     I just saw it, it&#39;s really good. For anyone that wanted to go download it or see it in theaters, I really recommend it. I actually got chills. I&#39;d give it a 8/10 because there was some missing information throughout the story regarding the manager (Samuel L. Jackson), and the occurrences that happened in the room, to correspond with the previous victim. Anyways, it was a great movie over all. I hope you feel the same.</description>
