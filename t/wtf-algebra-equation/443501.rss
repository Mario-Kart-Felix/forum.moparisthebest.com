    <title>WTF algebra equation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wtf-algebra-equation/443501</link>
    <description>Can anyone tell me if this is right...

The equation is
(√(|X+5|)-6)[sup]2[/sup]+4=20

Or

&quot;(sqrt(abs(X+5)-6)[sup]2[/sup]+4=20&quot;

sqrt = Square Root

abs = Absolute Value

i solved this and got

X = -25, 25, -65, 65

im i correct?</description>

My algebra 1 teacher mopped the floor with us, luckily I passed with a B, but I didn’t think it could get any worse the next year in geometry…<br>

5 minutes later<br>
Random student: “Why is (Question ect)”<br>

<p>Last semester, had like a 79.8 percent, bitch gave me the C… I literally did all the homework, tried not to disturb class to get on her good side…<br>

<p>Oh so you technically cheated your way out?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No I don’t do the hw but I pass the tests<br>
because I do extra stuff at home. It’s not exactly cheating. The test is just testing you if you know your stuff about algebra. So I got a free pass in my alg test for getting 80 or higher on the regents.<br>
I took alg 2 in 8th i got only 87 <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> I did do my hw in 8th.

only 7 people in my whole school took the alg regents in 7th but i am glad it’s out of the way.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I mean it’s like the teacher cheated you out of the class though.  You got an 80 on the test, but that shouldn’t represent the overall grade in the class, or be a sum of it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I got 97 <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
anyone who got higher than 80 on the regents gets 100<br>
I mean she doesn’t care. If we show we can score than a 80, it reflects to the district that she has done good of her job<br>
[/quote]<br>
But the worst part was is that she was that she was the worst geometry teacher you can get, and everyone else had better explaining teachers which classes had all As and Bs, then my class at probably a D fucking average[/quote]<br>
I swear… I don’t know how teachers like that get hired.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sit at desk get higher than 500 in fruit ninja in classic mode<br>
represents good eye coordination<br>
Gets Hired<br>
Gets paid so fuckin much, buys ipad<br>
plays angry birds on ipad during all the important test dates<br>
Fails chillwitm888 for not putting his name on his test paper, even tho it was a solid obvious 95.<br>
Gets paid more<br>
never teaches</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ways to get hired.<br>
I almost failed the course because I was taking chemistry at the same time as geometry…<br>
chemistry was okay since the teacher actually taught<br>
geometry didnt teach shit and was like a fucking bulldog and ugly liek one 2<br>
9th grade was a fuck of a year… =.=<br>
i did ALL THE homework<br>
I got a 89 on the regents<br>
I didn’t put my name on 2 or 3 tests but they were about 90’s<br>
SHE Knew it was mine because<br>
she was like<br>
OH IS THIS URS??? GAARBAGE LOOOOLLLLLLL.<br>
she gave me a 75 I rightfully deserved a 90 or higher<br>
I should set her house on fire</p>

because I do extra stuff at home. It’s not exactly cheating. The test is just testing you if you know your stuff about algebra. So I got a free pass in my alg test for getting 80 or higher on the regents.<br>

<p>I mean it’s like the teacher cheated you out of the class though.  You got an 80 on the test, but that shouldn’t represent the overall grade in the class, or be a sum of it.</p>

<p>I got 97 <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
anyone who got higher than 80 on the regents gets 100<br>
I mean she doesn’t care. If we show we can score than a 80, it reflects to the district that she has done good of her job[/quote]<br>
But the worst part was is that she was that she was the worst geometry teacher you can get, and everyone else had better explaining teachers which classes had all As and Bs, then my class at probably a D fucking average</p>

My algebra 1 teacher mopped the floor with us, luckily I passed with a B, but I didn’t think it could get any worse the next year in geometry…<br>
for example:<br>
Calm Teacher:“You guys did bad on your tests, i notice that you don’t ask questions, ask them if you have them, they will help”<br>
5 minutes later<br>
Random student: “Why is (Question ect)”<br>
ENRAGED TEACHER: “WHAT DO YOU MEAN I JUST EXPLAINED THIS SHIT 5 MINUTES AGO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU’RE ALL GONNA FAIL AT LIFE AT THIS RATE”, continue rant</p>
<p>Last semester, had like a 79.8 percent, bitch gave me the C… I literally did all the homework, tried not to disturb class to get on her good side…<br>
I’m usually not this bad at math but I mean the teacher has to actually teach…<br>

D: I had the same kind of teacher in geometry. I was like ‘yo miss, wtf IS WIT THIS PROOFF??? GUISEEE???’<br>
then she was liek PMG WTF L2PROOF BITCH SO I ACTUALLY had to FUCKIN studi 4 the regents<br>
i got a 89 but SHE DIDNT TEACH FUKIN SHet<br>

omg algebra… good times. This was the easiest regents I EVER took.<br>
i got a 97, so I am good<br>
I took the regents in 7th grade<br>
You are terribly low in iq.<br>
x= 17 or -27<br>

<p>Oh cool you think your so smart because you took the test in 7th grade!!! You cannot judge a persons iq by one subject matter…[/quote]<br>
yeh men I muss hab billion iq points or somethin<br>
obvs<br>
No but serious I am just saying algebra was the easiest subject.<br>
everyone in my school who had a avg gpa of 89.95+ (in 7th grade) got to take it<br>
(i barely had enough to make the cut, but the test was easy)<br>
(I would have failed the course. But luckily the teacher said, anyone who scored higher than 80 on the regents get an automatic 100 in her class. I don’t do any of the hw)</p>

<p>What you have there is wrong and complete nonsense.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">EDIT</span> On a side note: You’re a fucking retard and I already regret posting the solution.</p>
<p>|x + 5| means that the equation branches off into 2 parts.</p>
<p>First one is when x + 5 is positive -&gt; x + 5.<br>
Second one is when x + 5 is negative -&gt; -(x + 5) -&gt; -x - 5.</p>
<p>The answers are x1 = 95, x2 = -1, x3 = -9, x4 = -105.</p>
