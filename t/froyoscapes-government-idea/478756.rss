[size=6pt](Credits to [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=545549]tyb97[/url])[/size][/center]

[center][size=18pt][b]Government Idea[/b][/size][/center]

	Each city will have it&#39;s own government, and each player will be &#39;born&#39; in random cities. It will show where you were born. Each person who was born in a certain city has extra right/less rights. It depends on where you are.

[center][b]Lumbridge[/b][/center]
	If the player is born in Lumbridge, they will have equality with every city but Falador. This is due to Lumbridge not having any war.

[center][b]Varrock[/b][/center]
	If the player is born in Varrock, Falador people will restrict rights from you. Lumbridge will, however, like you more. 

[center][b]Falador[/b][/center]
	If the player is born in Falador, Varrock and Lumbridge will not like you. However, there will be spies on Varrock and neutrals in Varrock &amp; Lumbridge that will do duties for you. Falador is knwon as the hated city due to them making a war with almost every city on the land of Gielinor. They have a large castle, and that is the central of the soldiers. The city of Falador has high pride, is deadly, and dangerous, but if you do end up being born in Falador, good luck! You will have a hard life! Draynor will be neutral towards you, and there, you can cut trees in the Lumbridge-Draynor border and fish in Draynor city. Some ups for Falador!

[center][b]Ardougne[/b][/center]
	If the player is born in Ardougne, they will be loved by the people of Catherby and Camelot. They will also be neutral and known as &#39;travelers&#39; by Falador, Varrock, and Lumbridge cities. Ardougne has neutriality also with Rimmington, the central of training.

[center][b]Camelot[/b][/center]
	If the player is born in Camelot, they will be loved by the people of Catherby and Ardougne. Just like Ardougne, people born here will be known as &#39;travelers&#39; by citizens of Varrock, Falador, and Lumbridge. Camelot is loved by the people of Rimmington.

[center][b]Catherby[/b][/center]
	If the player is born in Catherby, they will be loved by the people of Camelot and Ardougne. Just like Camelot, people born here will be known as &#39;travelers&#39; by people of Varrock, Falador, and Lumbridge. No hatred is towards Catherby.

[center][b]Draynor[/b][/center]
	If the player is born in Draynor, all cities are neutral to them. That is because Draynor is the central of supplies (due to the city supporting woodcutting and fishing and also having a close bank for that). Draynor is loved by falador more than any other city however, due to Falador and Draynor having a good history together, such as when Draynor and Falador teamed and attacked Varrock and ended victorious.

[center][b]Prices[/b][/center]
	Prices will depend on where the player is born. The prices also depend on how much rivalry the two cities that you were born in and the city you currently are in. On your screen, when you are in a different city, there will be some text on your screen showing the rivalry of your city to the city you currently are on. It will be displayed like this:

Rivalry: PERCENT%

PERCENT will be a number of how much hatred or love the people will have between the two cities. if it is 0%, then it will be the normal, average prices from your home town. However, if there is above 10%, then there are different, set prices. Watch this chart:

[center]10% - 5 gp more
20% - 10 gp more
30% - 15 gp more
40% - 18 gp more
50% - 25 gp more
60% - 30 gp more
70% - 45 gp more
80% - 50 gp more
90% - 60 gp more
100% - 80 gp more[/center]</description>

              <p>Here’s an idea pertaining to my previous post about making town relations:<br>
It is a minigame.<br>
This goes into any of the creation skills (being fletching, crafting, magic, etc.)<br>
You can craft a special item that you can imbue with the name of the town you are gifting it to, and present it to the king/lord/duke of the town.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">The Story Line:</span></p>
<blockquote>You are in your town, and you talk to a messenger who tells you that it is the lord/vassal/duke/king/queen's birthday or any other special occasion that day.
You are given the option, with some sort of timer being set (maybe the castle wars timer method can be used), to create some sort of special gift to please the lord/vassal/duke/king/queen.
When you are done creating said gift, you talk to the messenger, and he asks if you would like him to teleport you to the lord/vassal/duke/king/queen of the area you are gifting to.
You are teleported to the town, and give the present to the lord/vassal/duke/king/queen.</blockquote>
[u]Where to Start the Minigame[/u]
<blockquote>[ul][li]Talk to a messenger that spawns in a random spot within each city's castle[/li]
[li]You can only take part in this minigame once every 5 days, thus leaving the hostility aspect of the game still in affect.[/li][/ul]</blockquote>
[u]The Requirements:[/u]
<blockquote>For Fletching:
<p>[ul][li]No requirements besides those existing fletching requirements[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>For Crafting:</p>
<p>[ul][li]No requirements besides those existing crafting requirements[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>For Imbuing(Magic):</p>
<p>[ul][li]To imbue is to mark the name of the town you are gifting to, into the present.[/li]<br>
[li]In order to imbue, you are required to have at least level 20 magic, depending on the tier of imbueing you wish to complete.[list]<br>
[li]Tier 1: You imbue the name of the town into the gift (requires level 20 magic)[/li]<br>
[li]Tier 2: You imbue the name of gifted into the gift (requires level 45 magic)[/li]<br>
[/list][/li]<br>
[li]The gifts are trade-able, thus letting you trade gifts to other players in order to have them imbued for skillers[/li][/ul]</p>
</blockquote><br>
<span class="bbcode-u">The Rewards:</span>
<blockquote>[ul][li]You are gifted generously in a set amount of gold coins[/li]
[li]You are given a title that says the name of the town you have gifted to[/li]
[li]The burden of hostility in the town is temporary lifted from your shoulders, this will last 2 days[/li][/ul]</blockquote>
That is all I can think of for now regarding this minigame. ;)

<p>[center][size=18pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Government Idea</span>[/size][/center]</p>
<pre><code>Each city will have it's own government, and each player will be 'born' in random cities. It will show where you were born. Each person who was born in a certain city has extra right/less rights. It depends on where you are.
</code></pre>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">Lumbridge</span>[/center]<br>
If the player is born in Lumbridge, they will have equality with every city but Falador. This is due to Lumbridge not having any war.</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">Varrock</span>[/center]<br>
If the player is born in Varrock, Falador people will restrict rights from you. Lumbridge will, however, like you more.</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">Falador</span>[/center]<br>
If the player is born in Falador, Varrock and Lumbridge will not like you. However, there will be spies on Varrock and neutrals in Varrock &amp; Lumbridge that will do duties for you. Falador is knwon as the hated city due to them making a war with almost every city on the land of Gielinor. They have a large castle, and that is the central of the soldiers. The city of Falador has high pride, is deadly, and dangerous, but if you do end up being born in Falador, good luck! You will have a hard life! Draynor will be neutral towards you, and there, you can cut trees in the Lumbridge-Draynor border and fish in Draynor city. Some ups for Falador!</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">Ardougne</span>[/center]<br>
If the player is born in Ardougne, they will be loved by the people of Catherby and Camelot. They will also be neutral and known as ‘travelers’ by Falador, Varrock, and Lumbridge cities. Ardougne has neutriality also with Rimmington, the central of training.</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">Camelot</span>[/center]<br>
If the player is born in Camelot, they will be loved by the people of Catherby and Ardougne. Just like Ardougne, people born here will be known as ‘travelers’ by citizens of Varrock, Falador, and Lumbridge. Camelot is loved by the people of Rimmington.</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">Catherby</span>[/center]<br>
If the player is born in Catherby, they will be loved by the people of Camelot and Ardougne. Just like Camelot, people born here will be known as ‘travelers’ by people of Varrock, Falador, and Lumbridge. No hatred is towards Catherby.</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">Draynor</span>[/center]<br>
If the player is born in Draynor, all cities are neutral to them. That is because Draynor is the central of supplies (due to the city supporting woodcutting and fishing and also having a close bank for that). Draynor is loved by falador more than any other city however, due to Falador and Draynor having a good history together, such as when Draynor and Falador teamed and attacked Varrock and ended victorious.</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">Prices</span>[/center]<br>
Prices will depend on where the player is born. The prices also depend on how much rivalry the two cities that you were born in and the city you currently are in. On your screen, when you are in a different city, there will be some text on your screen showing the rivalry of your city to the city you currently are on. It will be displayed like this:</p>
<p>Rivalry: PERCENT%</p>
<p>PERCENT will be a number of how much hatred or love the people will have between the two cities. if it is 0%, then it will be the normal, average prices from your home town. However, if there is above 10%, then there are different, set prices. Watch this chart:</p>
<p>[center]10% - 5 gp more<br>
20% - 10 gp more<br>
30% - 15 gp more<br>
40% - 18 gp more<br>
50% - 25 gp more<br>
60% - 30 gp more<br>
70% - 45 gp more<br>
80% - 50 gp more<br>
90% - 60 gp more<br>
100% - 80 gp more[/center]</p>
