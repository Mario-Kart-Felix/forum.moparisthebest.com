    <description>[size=18pt][b]Introduction:[/b][/size]
From Dust to Dragons - is going to be a sandbox in the Runescape world; there will be no introductions, quests or anything of that sort - Just you and the world.
The aim is to have a large crafting system, accessibility (no level-wise restrictions) and player interaction. 

[size=18pt][b]Goal[/b]:[/size]
To have a server in which the entire world is fully functional without the need to have some quest take/complete to access; a server where players discuss boss fights and their mechanics, a place where they can master a skill (I don&#39;t mean level-wise), trade items and help each other (promoting this via positive game mechanics) and lastly but not least - Have something to explore. I want the world to have little secrets like... &quot;What would happen if I use this on t- OOOH! :3 very nice.&quot;.

[size=18pt][b]Type[/b]:[/size]
Made for the bog-standard 317 Moparscape client with no custom items.

[size=18pt][b]How to apply and what you will need:[/b][/size]
I am looking for a mature person with patience and consistency in their online times;
Currently there are two spaces open:
1. Content designer (thinking of content fitting to the context and being able to take constructive criticism/adjusting around the game engines limitations).
2. Play-tester (looking for objects that are affected by some remnants of the source in an un-intended way, looking for ways to break the progression and finding bugs).

Preferably you will have Skype/Steam/Origin installed or if not, at least be reasonably active on this forum (PM-system).
[b]Application template:[/b]
How long you&#39;ve been around RSPS community/servers:
An aspect of the game you have most ideas for:

If you feel shy, you can PM me this.

[size=18pt][b]What do I get?[/b][/size]
Access to the server from the moment I accept your application
Moderator powers when the server goes up and live
Ability to find out what I&#39;m doing at that very moment in time

[size=18pt][b]About myself:[/b][/size]
I have coded Java on-off in past 7-8 years (blimey o.0 that&#39;s a long time...)
&lt;blockquote&gt;Date Registered:
    November 08, 2006, 11:13:35 PM&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I have sufficient knowledge of the source that I&#39;m working with to do anything; I&#39;ve set myself challenges in the past and I&#39;ve achieved them in one way or another (usually the limit is the client engine);
And as a little preview of my ALMIGHTY POWERS... I will share a piece of my crafting framework :)

In these arrays I don&#39;t have all of the metals placed within them; these will be the metals used for crafting armor, the rest will serve other purposes.
[code]
	public int[] craftedHelmet = { 1153, 1159, 1161, 1163, 3486 };
	public int[] craftedHelmetCost = { 5, 5, 1, 1, 5 };
	public int[] craftedChestpiece = { 1115, 1121, 1123, 1127, 3481 };
	public int[] craftedChestpieceCost = { 10, 10, 3, 4, 10 };
	public int[] craftedLegs = { 1067, 1071, 1073, 1079, 3483 };
	public int[] craftedLegsCost = { 10, 10, 3, 4, 10 };
	public int[] craftedShield = { 1191, 1197, 1199, 1201, 3488 };
	public int[] craftedShieldCost = { 7, 7, 2, 3, 7 };
	public int[] craftedBar = { 2351, 2359, 2361, 2363, 2365 };
[/code]
craftingType is by default -1; when the player uses a metal on an anvil, the crafting type is set... which is when a dialogue box opens in chat and offers the player options. 
This is what happens when a player clicks on an option:
[code]
				if (craftingType &gt;= 0) {
							if (playerHasItem(craftedBar[craftingType], craftedChestpieceCost[craftingType])){
							int i = 0;
							for (i = craftedChestpieceCost[craftingType]; i &gt; 0; i--) {
							deleteItem(craftedBar[craftingType], getItemSlot(craftedBar[craftingType]), 1);
							}
							addItem(c.craftedChestpiece[c.craftingType], 1);
							sendMessage(&quot;You have successfully crafted: &quot; + getItemName(craftedChestpiece[craftingType]) +&quot;.&quot;);
							craftingType = -1;
                            closeInterface();
							} else if (!playerHasItem(craftedBar[craftingType], craftedChestpieceCost[craftingType])) {
							sendMessage(&quot;I don&#39;t have enough &quot; + getItemName(craftedBar[craftingType]) + &quot;.&quot;);
							craftingType = -1;
                            closeInterface();
							}	
							}
[/code]


Thank you for reading :) have a nice day!</description>
