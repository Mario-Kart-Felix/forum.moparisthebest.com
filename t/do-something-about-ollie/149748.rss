    <description>[quote=&quot;Ollie&quot;]thanks for the bot i only think it fair if you get a copy of it thanks
http://www.uploadyour.info/download.php?filename=osrb-byfrank25208.rar

i work on converting my transform over soon you good at it yes
thanks for your amazing bot thanks you make me do good friend[/quote]

so i hurd this is a total rip of my updater and silver_lining + newbiehacker&#39;s bot. he has gone and stuck &quot;created by oliver&quot; comments in almost every class, inadquate credit is given to the creaters of the systems he is so heavily reliant on.

this is not the first time he has done this either

i request that he be derepped and has his java cup removed, because its a pathetic thing for him to be doing, and because i would like to see a staff member give a shit about something for once</description>

<p>If what I said is seen as flaming, then your understanding of the word is absurd. My response to your previous post was nothing short of completely honest in every possible way.</p>
<p>Watered down, boy to boy, conversations belong in a school playground. This website is for reasonable adult discussion, which may at times be negative. What I have to say about you is negative, but certainly not unreasonable. It was said in a reasonable way too.</p>
<p>Try using your brain for once: if you manage to do so, then you may be able to differentiate between silly, irrelevant, obnoxious replies (which would, in a sense, be flaming), and legitimate, reasonable, and perhaps not so positve, replies.</p>

<p>Read and try to understand it. Many countries have very similar copyright laws. You clearly do not understand the relationship between licensing and copyrights. You cannot license code that is a derivative work based on copyrighted code.</p>
<p>And your ‘search’ is broken. I never said ‘law’. I said legal and the context was completely different. You, with no legal right to a license have no legal standing in any court to enforce your invalid license.</p>
<p>Before you hit the reply button, please research. If you think I’m wrong prove it. Your <span class="bbcode-b">ass</span>umptions about what I may or may not <span class="bbcode-i">seem</span> to understand got old with your first ignorant post. Your second post simply hit idiot pay-dirt. If you disagree, step up and show me where I’m wrong instead of vague blanket statements.</p>
<p>Your churlish comment about my mother? Wow, what are you? 5? So much for global moderators being held to a higher standard.</p>
<p>Thank you for your ‘well written posts’ comment though. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>EDIT: grr url tag<br>
[/quote]<br>
global mods are held to no standards.  Its the people who contribute to the forums, they are held to a high standard.<br>
Example in this thread i see “newbiehacker” is muted.  I see mostly Contributor get warned/muted/banned.  I have been banned multiple times.  I have yet to see a mod punished.[/quote]<br>
One word: misinformed.</p>
<p>Do you know who gets to hold staff to a certain standard? You, along with other users, do. You always rave on about how you aren’t a political person, and how this stuff is all about politics. Well here’s a very simple lesson: Governments do not last without support from the people. Having said that, I notice that this website has a great many users - we’re obviously doing ‘something’ right, correct?</p>
<p>Oh, and just so you know before you go dribbling shit again, Newbiehacker got muted because Newbiehacker decided it’d be funny to act stupidly in a topic, an idea orchestrated in IRC.<br>
Lothy didn’t make Newbiehacker, a contributor, do what he did.<br>
Mopman didn’t do it either - nor did any of the other staff.<br>
Guess who made Newbiehacker do what he did. Newbiehacker made Newbiehacker do it.</p>
<p>Just so you know, your president is eligible for prison if he does certain things, and he’s a far bigger contributor (positive or negative, I leave that for you to decide) then anyone on here.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s time to stop acting like an innocent, hard done by, boy, and to start acting like a grown man - if you do something, either good or bad, own it. Don’t put it on someone else, like you seem to do so well.<br>
It’s always somebody else’s fault with you Ruler. Ruler needs to start taking responsibility for whatever Ruler decides to get up to.</p>

<p>Exactly. Most companies who are reversing a commercial product to clone it/write software that works alongside it will use developers who have never seen the original products source code, but this is by no means a legal requirement.</p>

<p>Do/have any of you actually ever worked for a major software developer? It dont seem like it.</p>
<p>Just because something is developed to work with/inside/alongside etc… someone else’s product does not mean a license and copyright is uneforcable for it. Wether the company’s product it is intended to work with wants it around or not. Some will endorse a product made to work for them, some will shun the other product, but unless laws was broken in the process, they cant do anything. Fair use allows for examination of the target product for just this purpose, along with other things.</p>

<p>Read and try to understand it. Many countries have very similar copyright laws. You clearly do not understand the relationship between licensing and copyrights. You cannot license code that is a derivative work based on copyrighted code.</p>
<p>And your ‘search’ is broken. I never said ‘law’. I said legal and the context was completely different. You, with no legal right to a license have no legal standing in any court to enforce your invalid license.</p>
<p>Before you hit the reply button, please research. If you think I’m wrong prove it. Your <span class="bbcode-b">ass</span>umptions about what I may or may not <span class="bbcode-i">seem</span> to understand got old with your first ignorant post. Your second post simply hit idiot pay-dirt. If you disagree, step up and show me where I’m wrong instead of vague blanket statements.</p>
<p>Your churlish comment about my mother? Wow, what are you? 5? So much for global moderators being held to a higher standard.</p>
<p>Thank you for your ‘well written posts’ comment though. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>EDIT: grr url tag[/quote]<br>
global mods are held to no standards.  Its the people who contribute to the forums, they are held to a high standard.<br>
Example in this thread i see “newbiehacker” is muted.  I see mostly Contributor get warned/muted/banned.  I have been banned multiple times.  I have yet to see a mod punished.</p>
<p>As for licensing of code, many people do not respect licenses.  Also very few even license.  Some assume by posting code their are implied licenses etc.</p>
<p>I do remember lengthy IRC conversations where i urged Silver Lining to license his code.  However that is not possible since alot of his code base is derived from other people code.  In the US, just reading a implmentation of a solution and writing your own is called a derivitive.</p>
<p>I have had issues with Ollie probably starting about 2 years back with Aryan.  However today he is mature and works very hard.</p>
<p>Regex has asked many times for moparscape full source to be released since it uses Aryan, whos license requires source to be publicly available.</p>

<p>To sum up, using small words that you are more likely to read and understand:</p>
<p>Go ahead, license your code that violates licenses or TOS of a commercial product. All I am saying is that it amuses me that some people actually think they can enforce said license. Once it comes to light that your code is based on the work product of another licensed work (copyrighted work at that), your license is void because you don’t have the right to license it unless the work product is your own.

<p>Bull. Your legal battle would be stupid and fruitless. I agree with you wholeheartedly that it is incredibly lame to cannibalize code without giving credit where it is due. It’s just as stupid to talk about some kind of legal precedent you may have; you’re writing code that explicitly violates the license of a commercial product. Stop talking about your perceived legal rights ffs.</p>
