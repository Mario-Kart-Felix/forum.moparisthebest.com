    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-run-error-problem-thread-4-do-not-want-to-be-spoon-fed/363087</link>
    <description>ok here is the error im getting i do not want to be told how to fix the problem as i would rather figure it out myself but can someone point me in the right direction where should i specifically be looking like what file name so i can try and fix it. or is this error just due to the client not connecting to where the server is being hosted?

<p>thanks death that was the sort of helpful info i was looking for i will edit this post to say whether i got it fixed or not lol<br>
<em>edit</em><br>
thanks very much death i was able to fix it but here lies a problem it was this that caused the problem</p>
<pre><code>public URL getCodeBase()
{
    if(signlink.mainapp != null)
        return signlink.mainapp.getCodeBase();
    try
    {
        if(super.aFrame_Sub1_15 != null)
            return new URL("http://127.0.0.1:" + (43594 + anInt958));
    }
    catch(Exception _ex) { }
    return super.getCodeBase();
}
</code></pre>
<p>if i change <a href="http://127.0.0.1" rel="nofollow noopener">http://127.0.0.1</a> to my ip without the http:// it gives me that error and if i use <a href="http://myip" rel="nofollow noopener">http://myip</a> it says the following:</p>
<p>no response from server please try using a different world obviously with the localhost ip in replacement for my actual ip it works perfectly so i was wondering if any of you guys or death has any ideas?</p>

<p>uhhhh thanks… for that i said within respect to pointing me in the right direction you have just told me the bare obvious which has pointed me to god knows how many different causes and fixes once again THANKS! - note the sarcasm as i have been told how to fix it ok but ummm the most helpful part would be… where the problem is coming from what file and as the nullpointer help from google is not directed on the use of servers one must ask a community for help not some smart allec to put that next time think a little i was asking to be directed to the file not for the fix</p>
