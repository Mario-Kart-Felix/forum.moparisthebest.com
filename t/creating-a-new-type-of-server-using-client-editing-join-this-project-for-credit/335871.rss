    <title>Creating a new type of server using client editing, join this project for credit</title>

    <description>[b]Okay, first of all I am not bribing anyone. The reason why my title says &quot;Join this project for credit&quot; is because I am letting you know that if you are in on this project you will have credit guaranteed depending on what you do.[/b]

I am working on creating a &quot;Different&quot; type of Private Server using Client Editing.

This Client WILL NOT contain custom items that require models, only things like Skillcapes, Dragon Boots, Rune Defender, ETC.

We will be creating our own custom items using Recoloring, Renaming, and things like that.

I have already created things like new Bronze, Iron, Steel, Black, Mithril, Adamant, and Rune Full Helms, Boots, and 2h Swords using Recoloring and Renaming.

For Example: I took the model image from Veracs Helm and Recolored it to the Iron color, changed the name to Iron Full Helm, and replaced the regular Iron Full Helm by using the same ID that the Iron Full Helm uses.

If anyone has any really good ideas for Custom Items by using Recoloring, Renaming, Image Using, ETC. please post your ideas here and you will receive credit if your idea is used.

It would be VERY NICE if you could post the Class8 codes for your items instead so I don&#39;t have to code them myself.

[b]If you are going to flame please just ignore this topic instead.[/b]
