    <title>Who would like to join a project?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/who-would-like-to-join-a-project/364781</link>
    <description>Hello people,

i am new to moparisthebest and i think its the first time ive ever posted on here i was always on the moparscape forums.
anyway let me get to the point i was just wondering if anybody wanted to help create a runescape guide/help website and community. not just community i want it to be based on a/or round a website.

im just wondering who would be interested if there is anybody out there.

thanks for reading.</description>

mat wale: Making a good runescape helping site is lots of work, unless you leach from others and I don’t think you know what you are doing.<br>
Just collection people at random won’t get you there. Also your English isn’t good enough to make a decent site either.</p>

<p>sorry i never new you had to have an english degree to make a runescape related website. plus like im going to sit here an type like i am writing an essay theres no need im chilaxing.[/quote]<br>
Yes, but there is a difference between reading a decent post and a post typed out by a retard! If it doesn’t look nice and presentable then most people don’t bother reading shitty posts.</p>
<p>Now your first above isn’t the best because there are a few flaws, if you spend most of your time on the moparscape forums then your IQ is likely to be that of a dead nat. Another reason is that community projects don’t work here. Fact.</p>

<p>an why cant we play runescape cause we can.<br>
also you say that we have this so why do we need more junk.<br>
