    <title>Something I wrote</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/something-i-wrote/306956</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve written things before, but nothing like this. We have this thing called SRT? Student Resource time. (pseudonyms: homeroom, break, study hall) Anyways, I had nothing to do so I started thinking of things, which lead to writing some things, which lead to this.

I don&#39;t want you to just read it as much as understand it. If you think you know the meaning behind it, say it. If you have questions about anything specific, ask and I&#39;ll explain. What I want most of all is someone to understand what I write, because everyone I show only compliments or criticizes me.

Anyways, here it is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[center][b]Crazy until you&#39;re 32 times 2, wait that&#39;s 64. Beatles knocking on your front door, Dylan knocking on the back, attack opportunity like there&#39;s only one chance. What&#39;s a song with no dance? Our era, a man climbing on hills like he&#39;s lost-- Syds Barretts mind zone forever perfect like a metronome but so far from home. Timothy Leary had a theory, &quot;All weary, none aware.&quot; fear in the air, no truth but scare tactics. It&#39;s the magic that comes through our TVs. Repeat the 60&#39;s please one more time for me, I missed the part where art was love, when dreams were white, new seeds and doves. Revolution kept it&#39;s title, because like a circle we&#39;re back to the beginning and still have our eyes closed. What&#39;s peace without destruction, what&#39;s hating without loving, what&#39;s good without bad but an hour glass with no sand. No one without the other, they must exist together; however much better you see one of the two. True blue is not blue but a shade of gray, new moon brings good news then fades away. Ignorance is bliss, reminisce past tense, pointless unchangeable, unfair but that&#39;s the way it goes. Everything you say means nothing unless it&#39;s heard, sad thing today is words are only words. And everything that&#39;s heard means nothing unless respected, my name could be an angels curse but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s blessed. The ecstasy can get the best of me, but what matters is what&#39;s left of me. Rest my knees, I&#39;ve been on my feet forever it seems, and like the trees I&#39;m holding the whole world up above me. Harmony is hard to see because it&#39;s just the beginning to a bad ending. What&#39;s broke is broken and gone to me. No chance without a token we&#39;re in the open sea. Free but alone without support, already gone and can&#39;t abort. But why leave discovery. Trees cry and so do I, instead of one life I wish I had 9.[/b][/center]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Discuss? Hopefully you&#39;re not all oblivious.</description>

<p>There is a true meaning…the author’s intention. However the reader may interpret the poem differently, but it doesn’t change what the author was trying to get at.[/quote]<br>
All pieces of literature have a <span class="bbcode-b">prominent</span> interpretation; the one the author is trying to get at. That doesn’t mean it’s the true meaning of the piece though. Each person perceives the piece in a different way, so there are infinite meanings. You’re just speaking behalf of the author. If you’re talking about a ‘true meaning’, there is none.</p>

And if you’re talking to me, a lot of these things are symbolic and all have a purpose. I put everything in here for a reason, nothing in here doesn’t serve a purpose.</p>

<p>No, poems almost always have a meaning. It just depends on whether or not you’re deep enough to find it. Poems could also be an alegory (or symbolic), and you’re not sure what the author really means.</p>

wait that's 64.
Beatles knocking on your front door,
Dylan knocking on the back,
attack opportunity like there's only one chance.
What's a song with no dance?
<p>Our era, a man climbing on hills like he’s lost-- Syds Barretts mind zone forever perfect like a metronome but so far from home.<br>
Timothy Leary had a theory,<br>
“All weary, none aware.” fear in the air,<br>
no truth but scare tactics.<br>
It’s the magic that comes through our TVs.<br>
Repeat the 60’s please one more time for me,<br>
I missed the part where art was love,<br>
when dreams were white, new seeds and doves.<br>
Revolution kept it’s title,<br>
because like a circle we’re back to the beginning and still have our eyes closed. What’s peace without destruction,<br>
what’s hating without loving, what’s good without bad but an hour glass with no sand.<br>
No one without the other,<br>
they must exist together;<br>
however much better you see one of the two.<br>
True blue is not blue but a shade of gray,<br>
new moon brings good news then fades away.<br>
Ignorance is bliss, reminisce past tense,<br>
pointless unchangeable, unfair but that’s the way it goes.<br>
Everything you say means nothing unless it’s heard,<br>
sad thing today is words are only words.<br>
And everything that’s heard means nothing unless respected,<br>
my name could be an angels curse but that doesn’t mean it’s blessed.<br>
The ecstasy can get the best of me,<br>
but what matters is what’s left of me.<br>
Rest my knees,<br>
I’ve been on my feet forever it seems,<br>
and like the trees I’m holding the whole world up above me.<br>
Harmony is hard to see because it’s just the beginning to a bad ending.<br>
What’s broke is broken and gone to me.<br>
No chance without a token we’re in the open sea.<br>
Free but alone without support,<br>
already gone and can’t abort.<br>
But why leave discovery.<br>
Trees cry and so do I, instead of one life I wish I had 9.[/b][/center]</p>
