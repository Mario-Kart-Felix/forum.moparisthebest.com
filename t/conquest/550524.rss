(PICTURES OF SERVER BELOW)</p>
<p>Purpose of this: No media so showing people what they are downloading first.</p>
<p>Just signed on to see how it was. Staff is very friendly and owner seems active and chill.</p>
<p>But sadly no work has been done to the server except change the name to conquest. If you want server media look at this post.</p>

<p>The npc’s and the stalls are even in the same spots and all of the skilling areas are exactly the same, same interfaces.</p>
<p>I have taken side by side screen shots to show the differences that have been made</p>
<p>-And the starter is 14m and the 2nd account you get 5m. with ip changer can easily be abused.</p>
<p>-It still is very new server and i’m sure that they will make some changes to it.</p>
<p>-Again the staff is very friendly but owner is not looking for other coders so who knows where this server will end up in the future.</p>
<p>-5 constant players online</p>
<p>-And is “eco”.</p>
<p>-But go ahead and try it out if this is what you are looking for in a server but my personal opinion they just slapped on the name conquest and put online just  to make a quick buck.</p>
<p>-Even when the cache is downloaded it still even says in your C://Acheron.cache<br>

<p>You may not think that i’ve actually made any changes, but you’re only judging the server from the graphical aspects. Since hosting this server i’ve done a countless amount of updates daily, and no i’m not hosting the server “to make a quick buck”, i’m only doing this for the purpose of enjoyment, I don’t care if I get $1 from this or $1000, as long as i’m still having fun, then there is nothing else to it.[/quote]</p>
<p>Was just my opinion <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> good luck with your server!</p>
