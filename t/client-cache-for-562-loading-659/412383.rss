    <description>I downloaded this source at my home.. [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,512086.0.html]https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,512086.0.html[/url] 

[u][b]( I have dialup at home with a really good computer)[/b][/u]

And i had to manually download the cache, but I cant because my dads gets mad when i leave the internet on, And Im currently at my grandmas house with highspeed, and I got the cache download and i want to be able to code it from my home cause im always there... can you help me so i can have the cache downloaded at home please?

Also, Im not sure where the cache is actually downloaded to, as it doesnt just say it.. if &quot;user.home&quot; is it.. i have no idea where that is....

By the way, i was told that this is where it gets the cache, But im not quite sure what to do..


[code=actionscript]import java.awt.Color;


public class ClientSettings {

	public static String getCacheDir() {
		return System.getProperty(&quot;user.home&quot;) + &quot;/.rspsCache2&quot;; //only change this if you edit cache
	}
	public static final String cacheLink = &quot;http://armadyll.info/alex/cache2.zip&quot;; //make sure it zip
	public static final int cacheRevision = 3; //change this if you edit cache
	
	
	public static final String ip = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;;
	public static final int port = 43594;
	public static final String background_music_name = &quot;Scape Original&quot;; //rs classic music &lt;3
	public static final String serverName = &quot;OneWorld&quot;; //server name, also auto changes client title and load bar
	public static final String websiteLink = &quot;&quot;; //so it goes ur website instead of rs, example on acc creation terms service button
	public static final Color startLoadClientBackgroundColor = Color.black; //Color.black default
	public static final boolean disable_server_list = false; //dont disable this :D, ofc you may but then serverlist doesnt work anymore
	public static final boolean disable_ukeys_check = true; //containers table information check but ppl give weird names for stuff as: &quot;ukeys&quot;
	public static final boolean disable_keys_request = true; //if this true, disable_ukeys_check has to be true too, when this true, you can load client without connecting server
	
	/*
	 * WEBCLIENT
	 */
	//for webclient all you have to do is jar and sign
	//I RECOMMENT YOU TO USE JARMAKER APP FOR THAT http://download.cnet.com/JAR-Maker/3000-2213_4-10588876.html
	//main-class: client
	//applet-class:client too
	
	/*
	 * dont worry even trying hacking, this user is limited :)
	 */
	public static final String server_list_database = &quot;173.236.35.162:3306/tkoscap1_alex&quot;; //ip, database
	public static final String server_list_user = &quot;tkoscap1_alex2&quot;; //user
	public static final String server_list_pass = &quot;lol&quot;; //pass
}[/code]
