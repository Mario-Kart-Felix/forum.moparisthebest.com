              <p>If you are using testscape, Go to connected from, Then go to one of the guys you want to ban.</p>
<p>Then copy the ip adress. Then go to Data and click on Bannedâ€¦ not banned users. then copy the ip in the Banned. that should make it where they cant log in. if this doesnt work let me know</p>
