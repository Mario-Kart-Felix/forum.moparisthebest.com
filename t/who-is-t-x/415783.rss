    <title>Who is T X</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/who-is-t-x/415783</link>
    <description>Hello.

While I was reading some random RSC topics, I saw this:

&quot;We want nothing to do with T X or his work here.&quot;

What exactly did he do wrong?
I only see nice things he released n shit.</description>

To be honest you say 99.9% of his software has viruses? But if I go to any of his topics what he has released something even to his rsc bot, his private server the map editors… none of them had viruses in at all… even backing to 2008 when he posted something on the rs2 section… No viruses… I do not understand where you got them percentages from…</p>
<p>[/quote]<br>
I agree with this, not ALL of his stuff has viruses/malware.[/quote]<br>
I said 99%, he has released loads of shit, so 1% of it are clean, and how can you know about his map editors? There’s no way to check if it has malicious code in it, since it’s made in .NET, VB, C++ or something.</p>

He’s a fatass with big ego, and whenever he releases something, it has malware of somekind by 99.9%. Did I forget to mention that he’s a total dickhead?<br>
[/quote]lol big ego… that is spreading fast among guys that host private servers, but worst case are those that insult the guy but do the same things.<br>

He’s been always like that, big ass ego since he came into this community.</p>
