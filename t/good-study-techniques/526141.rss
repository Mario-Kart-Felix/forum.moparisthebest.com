    <description>I know we all have our own study techniques/rituals, mine is usually.... wait until the night before, and still usually never open a book, BUT I would like to improve this and get into some good study habits. I was just curious as to what you all find works best?

Hey mate,<br>
I was wondering if you had any experience with the TI-89 while studying engineering? My lecturer recommended it. I’m trying to find a program where I can store a few formulas on (mostly the quadratic formula, discriminant formula, etc). I know they’re basic formulas but I always struggle to remember them and find myself having to google it, lol[/quote]</p>
<p>Not really, we were usually allowed a 3x5 index card with key formulas for exams not calculators <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Ohhhh, I can’t believe I missed that. That makes perfect sense now.</p>
<p>In regards to question c) I can almost guarente I’m going to have to use the formula to find the arc length of a circle, but transpose it too find the radius, seeing as<br>
s = theta r, where s represents the distance along the circumference, r represents the radius from the center origin of the circle, and theta is obviously the subtending angle. Why this is in a assignment strictly on the topic of vectors I don’t really know.</p>
<p>If only Elec Engin was as easy as Computer Science (I shouldn’t really say that, CS is only really easy at the moment because I know most of it, heh, it will get a lot harder). Perhaps taking two majors was a bit more than I can handle, loool</p>

<p>For the first part (a) you calculated the distance it travels if it still were moving in a straight line. It’s a step onto getting the right answer. accounting for the change, the answer would be 2310m/cos(5.25) ~= 2319 m</p>

<p>for part ©<br>
I’m not really that sure, i feel like there’s some missing information[/quote]<br>
Hmm… I don’t really understand why you’re applying cosine to the angle. I can see why, sort of, given my knowledge of the trigonometric functions. But an indepth explanation would go a long way.<br>
Ps that is all the information I’m given</p>

              <p>[quote=“xxx123xxx, post:24, topic:526141”]Yo dude, I’ve finished all the math requirements for any engineering major (Straight A’s on the vector series <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> ) and in the process of transferring to double E.</p>
<p>For math, here’s how I prepare for exams and the class in general.</p>
<p>I usually skim the sections covered prior to lecture and attempt a few problems and jot down some notes on parts that the book does not explain too well. I usually get to the lecture hall like 30 minutes early and reread my notes of the previous lecture just to jog my memory of what we were previously doing. After Lecture hall, I do the assigned problems for each section and then I look back and see if I can do them differently than the way the professor presented (this is very very important as you get to the high level courses, new ways open up of doing problems).</p>
<p>For the exams, I give myself 3 days to prepare.<br>
First day, I go through my notes and rewrite all the major formulas + theorems presented in class on a single sheet of paper (if your professor gives you a study guide, finish it on this day)<br>
Second day, I redo every single homework problem assigned only using that single sheet of paper and the problems professors usually recommend in lecture but are not required<br>
Third day, Spend a couple hours reviewing before bed, sleep, wake up and review for the two hours before lecture!</p>
<p>Hope this helps![/quote]<br>
Hey man thanks for the advice, currently in the middle of the vector unit at the moment.</p>
<p>Well, I cannot work out this 1 particular question in my homework. I really get the feeling I am over complicating this, but hopefully someone here can help. I have come up with answers but I’m fairly sure I’m wrong, here’s the question;</p>
<p>A UFO is traveling at a constant speed of 5.5ms^(-1) at a fixed distance above the earth’s surface. It subtends an angle of 5.25 degrees in 7 minutes as it is observed moving between two points (A and B) in the night sky.</p>
<p>Calculate; a) how far it has travelled in 7 minutes? b) it’s speed in km/h c) how far it is above the earth’s surface.</p>
<p>Here’s what I have, but it doesn’t seem right.<br>
a) 2310 metres (420 seconds in 7 minutes * 5.5 meters a second = 2310)<br>
b) 19.8km/h (speed per minute = 2310 / 7 = 330. * 60 to convert to hours (60 mins in an hour)<br>
c) I get the feeling I need to use the formula s = theta r</p>

              <p>Yo dude, I’ve finished all the math requirements for any engineering major (Straight A’s on the vector series <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> ) and in the process of transferring to double E.</p>
<p>For math, here’s how I prepare for exams and the class in general.</p>
<p>I usually skim the sections covered prior to lecture and attempt a few problems and jot down some notes on parts that the book does not explain too well. I usually get to the lecture hall like 30 minutes early and reread my notes of the previous lecture just to jog my memory of what we were previously doing. After Lecture hall, I do the assigned problems for each section and then I look back and see if I can do them differently than the way the professor presented (this is very very important as you get to the high level courses, new ways open up of doing problems).</p>
<p>For the exams, I give myself 3 days to prepare.<br>
First day, I go through my notes and rewrite all the major formulas + theorems presented in class on a single sheet of paper (if your professor gives you a study guide, finish it on this day)<br>
Second day, I redo every single homework problem assigned only using that single sheet of paper and the problems professors usually recommend in lecture but are not required<br>
Third day, Spend a couple hours reviewing before bed, sleep, wake up and review for the two hours before lecture!</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

              <p>Of course it depends on the actual subject/how long you have for the project and etc.</p>
<p>What I used to try to do though would be to divide each day to a devoted time for studying that particular class.</p>
<p>Example: I might have a history test in seven days. So if I was to estimate I need to study at least for three hours total to successfully get this standard or grade on the test then I need to divide that three hours into seven days.</p>
<p>This would give you about 25-30 minutes each day to study. Which really isn’t a bad time period. Other tips I have learned over the years are:</p>
<p>-Don’t try to study late at night. Your body is already weakened and thus will not be at 100%. I know you may not like that the sound of this but it’s important to do it at it’s peak.<br>
-Don’t try to focus on one part of that subject too long in that period. If something is just not clicking at that time. Write it down and ponder on it later when you have a chance. Don’t forget about it either though! If you need to confront your teacher/professor about it.<br>
-Never, never, never get the attitude of “I know everything about this”. You may be a java guru for example, but ten years later you know what you may come to find out about a new way of doing something etc.<br>
-Read each line to yourself “out loud” in your head. This way you are really reading it twice.</p>

To be completely honest, I really think anyone can fly through high school with a 4.0 GPA, although it will be very study intensive; however, once you move on from a subject and your brain doesn’t relate to it anymore, it slowly fades away from your memory. In my Math 3 class last year, I had an A+ all year long, but I couldn’t work out one problem from last year, which is simply because I haven’t applied the knowledge in such a long time.</p>

<p>Just reward yourself short term, you do a few minutes work give yourself a few seconds of pleasure (I’m not talking about fapping etc…). Even if it’s a guilty pleasure. I know if I reward myself long term (long term is 30 mins for me, I have a short attention span, …like really short ;s) I over reward myself lmao.</p>

<p>I see the substitution method an algorithmic method and the combination method as more of a heuristic.</p>

Well, it’s worked so far… but that was the point of this thread. I get good marks currently, but I know I’d get amazing marks if I actually applied - and now I want to apply.</p>
<p>I must say, since I created this thread and began using Khan Academy, I now have a grasp on a lot of subjects I was struggling with. Thanks, glad I found that site. Similar question, anyone know of any decent sites with worksheets that provide answers? Just basically a page of questions, a page of their answers.</p>
