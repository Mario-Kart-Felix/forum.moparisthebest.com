    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-the-infinity-sign-number-show-there-is-no-beginning-to-time-anything/466633</link>
    <description>Now when a number on the number line goes  on, on, on, on, and on and never stops we use the infinity sign to represent it never ends, so does that mean that time or something that we say has a beginning really doesn&#39;t?  Yet what about zero seconds that shows it doesn&#39;t exist?  So is their a beginning to time?</description>

              <p>in my opinion the infinity time doesnt insist that theres no beginning to anything much like a “finite” sign, so to speak, doesn’t insist that there is a beginning<br>
matter cant be created or destroyed, so there had to have been something from the start in order to make everything that is</p>
<p>again, im no scientist and im not citing any sources, this is pure speculation</p>

There’s a contradiction in your argument. The idea is that there is no beginning, meaning there is no first event, yet you’re saying that some arbitrary point in time can never be reached… can never be reached from what? The first event? There’s your flaw. Again, there is no first event, so that obviously can’t be your reference point.</p>

<p>Listen to Stephan Hawking’s theories on the subject, they seem the most realistic to me.  He thinks that when all the mater in the universe was created, there was also ‘anti-mater’ created in the equal amount.  Sort of like digging a hole in the ground in order to make a hill.  And as for what sparked it, he states that it can appear from nothing as that’s the way things work on the quantum level.[/quote]<br>
there is actually various theories that things don’t just “appear” but they come from “somewhere else” which leads back to the same thing.</p>

Assuming you’re talking about the X-Axis and Y-Axis, they are usually symbolized as never ending by having arrow heads pointing outwards. The infinity sign came into play when mathematicians figured out that some numbers can go on forever, obviously.</p>

The earth began about 4.5 billion years ago, roughly 8.5 billion years after the Universe. And not sure who you are referring to but using the word “creation” doesn’t mean we are referring to god.</p>

Assuming you’re talking about the X-Axis and Y-Axis, they are usually symbolized as never ending by having arrow heads pointing outwards.

So if you say the universe has been “always there”, it doesn’t make sense, because time hadn’t always existed. To play your role, what makes you so sure it has always been there? Why would it (the universe, not time) have always been there?</p>
<p>[quote=“RandQm”]What makes you so sure? Have you been traveling through space to know?[/quote]You claim you believe it expands. So what makes you so sure? Heck, what makes the cosmologists so sure that space expands? I referred you to the earlier articles just for you to get the slightest idea that I’m trying to put across. It’s not my fault that you didn’t. It’s easy to throw the questions at a person right? I can shift the burden of proof too.</p>
<p>For the record, I do actually make an attempt to know what I’m talking about so I don’t look stupid.</p>

<p>you’re right, he did, because he was quite frankly ahead of his time</p>
<p>einstein had originally predicted that the universe would either be in a state of expansion or contradiction, but the general theories at the time were that the universe was static in size, einstein modified his theories with a cosmological constant to fit the ideas of a static universe and it wasn’t until several years later where hubble had direct proof that the universe was expanding that einstein dropped the idea of a static universe and admitted it was the, and I’m paraphrasing “biggest cock-up of his life”, but just like most good stories there was a twist, with the discovery of an accelerating expansion of the universe in 1998 was einsteins cosmological constant bought back into the mainstream attention</p>

You can’t say the universe is expanding into nothingness (more so than the empty void that is space) because for all you know we may be a universe within and multiverse of universes, just as we are a galaxy within a universe of galaxies.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>a common idea for multiple universes is that the interior of a black hole contains a universe, such an idea would mean that yes, the universe expanding would be expanding into nothingness because the interior of a black hole would be infinitely dense</p>
<p>there are a plethora of ideas for how multiverses can work and none of them really suggest that universes are like physical balloons where they may not collide with each other, all we can know for certain that everything that can physically exists does exist within our universe and we cannot know what exists outside our own universe, the very question of what exists outside out universe is illogical</p>
<p>[quote author=RandQm link=topic=583400.msg4157917#msg4157917 date=1352816139]I’m saying that beyond what we can observe there can be other bows/bendings? in space,<br>
like said we are only a small dot, it’s not because it’s expanding where we can see and maybe many dots more that this is the case everywhere, we have no clue what’s more out there, we see the universe expanding around us in our observable space, what are we the centre of the universe? don’t think so.[/quote]</p>
<p>since you’re arguing that only the observable universe is expanding and not the universe as a hole, the logical thing to question would be what about hubble’s law? hubble’s law states that the further away an object is from its observer, the faster it will be travelling, does this law cease to exist at the edge of the observable universe? because if you think so and can back this opinion up, you may just have debunked general relativity</p>
<p>also worth noting is that the rate of expansion is increasing<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Voila, it states that how farder away how faster it travels, so then you could state the question, does it even expand?<br>
I do believe it does, but this is space, nothing is sure. Einstein had to modify his own laws and many of his theories are already debunked the day of today.</span></p>

<p>You can’t say the universe is expanding into nothingness (more so than the empty void that is space) because for all you know we may be a universe within and multiverse of universes, just as we are a galaxy within a universe of galaxies.</p>

</aside>
<p>a common idea for multiple universes is that the interior of a black hole contains a universe, such an idea would mean that yes, the universe expanding would be expanding into nothingness because the interior of a black hole would be infinitely dense</p>
<p>there are a plethora of ideas for how multiverses can work and none of them really suggest that universes are like physical balloons where they may not collide with each other, all we can know for certain that everything that can physically exists does exist within our universe and we cannot know what exists outside our own universe, the very question of what exists outside out universe is illogical</p>
<p>[quote=“RandQm, post:73, topic:466633”]I’m saying that beyond what we can observe there can be other bows/bendings? in space,<br>
like said we are only a small dot, it’s not because it’s expanding where we can see and maybe many dots more that this is the case everywhere, we have no clue what’s more out there, we see the universe expanding around us in our observable space, what are we the centre of the universe? don’t think so.[/quote]</p>
<p>since you’re arguing that only the observable universe is expanding and not the universe as a hole, the logical thing to question would be what about hubble’s law? hubble’s law states that the further away an object is from its observer, the faster it will be travelling, does this law cease to exist at the edge of the observable universe? because if you think so and can back this opinion up, you may just have debunked general relativity</p>
<p>also worth noting is that the rate of expansion is increasing</p>

<p>books are JUST AS BAD as wikipedia</p>
<p>the fact wikipedia can be edited is not an argument against the validity of the source, ALL edits to a page can be viewed by end-users, ALL previous versions of a page can also be viewed by end-users, if a quote links to a source you can cross-check the validity of the wikpedia article to the source</p>

<span class="bbcode-b">Why wouldn’t it? What makes you so sure it wasn’t always there?</span></p>
<p>[quote author=RandQm]Yes it does in the area that’s visible for us, that’s what I’m trying to say. We are a little dot on what’s the universe and can only see a dot far, there’s nothing that can prove that expansion is the case everywhere.[/quote]I don’t know why I picked up on your point earlier because you don’t make sense. Are you referring to the observable universe? Are you saying that beyond the observable universe, the remaining universe doesn’t expand? If so, why isn’t the night sky bright?<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">I’m saying that beyond what we can observe there can be other bows/bendings? in space,<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-u">The universe as a whole expands, and it isn’t expanding into anything</span>. There’s nothing outside the universe so in a way, the space you see or don’t see expands. If you actually read the <span class="bbcode-s">Wikipedia</span> articles to get the gist of what I was trying to say, you wouldn’t have shot me down just like that.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">What makes you so sure? Have you been traveling through space to know?</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Wikipedia? really? How about you go get some books and then come back, english wikipedia is a good source but if you only depend on one source that can be edited you shouldn’t be talking at all.</span></p>
