<p>Niall, I respect what you’re saying but would you care to show me a reputable source that explains how things like the big bang isn’t a theory for a definitive beginning, and that gravity/atoms/tectonic plates are just theory.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>well you see if you had started off reading from reputable sources we wouldn’t have this problem to begin with, allow me to explain, in your first post you said “The big bang, as the concept of a definitive beginning, is still just a theory and not a proven fact.”, this is complete nonsense and where you say “is still just a theory and not a proven fact.” you are COMPLETELY misinformed as to what a scientific theory and what a scientific fact is</p>
<p>lets start with something simple, evolution, in biology you have a process known as evolution (hereby referred to as biological evolution), biological evolution is only defined as “descent with modification”, if you reproduce and your offspring has different genes then biological evolution has occurred, biological evolution is an observable fact, but wham, semantics, the theory of evolution is NOT biological evolution therefore the theory of evolution is NOT a fact</p>
<p>before I continue I want to give a brief explanation of what science is, science can be described as the collection of knowledge based on observed natural phenomena, the scientific method can be described as how to explain said natural phenomena through testing and the formation of hypothesis</p>
<p>in science, a hypothesis is for all intense and purposes is the regular definition of theory, a hypothesis is an idea of how to explain the process of observed natural phenomena but without any evidence backing it up</p>
<p>in science, a theory is for all intense and purposes an idea backed by physical evidence, a scientific theory is used to explain natural phenomena which is tested against tests and observations, a scientific theory can of course be wrong because a scientific theory MUST BE DISPROVABLE, when a scientific theory is wrong all this means is the theory should be modified to best suite the new evidence, again this doesn’t mean the old evidence is wrong, merely incomplete</p>
<p>so, why’d I bother explaining (horribly) that? because a scientific theory is not and can not be a fact, a scientific theory is not a guess and it is not wrong just because it’s a theory, a scientific theory is an explanation of natural phenomena based on observations and testing</p>
<p>so, when people say “it’s just a theory and not a proven fact” they are COMPLETELY missing the point, the theory of gravity is “just a theory and not a proven fact” but we’re fairly fucking sure that matter attracts matter and the theory of gravity is an explanation of this process, germ theory is “just a theory and not a proven fact” but we’re fairly fucking sure that there are indeed germs and we’re fairly fucking sure if you contaminate someone with germs that they can get diseases and the germ theory is used to explain this phenomena, likewise the theory of plate tectonics is “just a theory and not a proven fact” but we can indeed observe fault lines between plates and bla bla bla</p>
<p>back to the theory of evolution, the theory of evolution explains (among other things) how the different animals and plants are in their current “forms” through processes such as natural selection, contrary to popular belief the theory of evolution does not explain how life arose (see: abiogenesis theory), this is analogous to your first question about the big bang being a definitive beginning, the big bang theory explains the expansion of space time from a singularity, to imply that the big bang theory is a definitive beginning is to imply that the big bang theory attempts to explain where or how the singularity got here(it doesn’t) and what came before (note: before is not applicable)</p>
<p>further reading: when scientists say “a theory must be disprovable” what they mean is the evidence must be testable, e.g., saying “god put evolution in motion” is not a valid theory because it cannot be disproved, god in this instance is an all powerful entity that cannot be proven nor disproven and does not belong in a scientific theory</p>
<p>sorry for the wall of text but it is semantics but those semantics are important, “it’s not a fact” does not apply to a scientific theory in proper context</p>
<p>and when I say semantics are important I say this because you later on in this thread say something completely wrong</p>

</aside>
<p>the big bang theory does not suggest creation, the big bang theory explains the process of the expansion of space-time from a singularity</p>
<p>to suggest it is “a beginning” isn’t applicable, we don’t know what was before the big bang (before isn’t applicable) and we will likely not be able to know beyond pure speculation</p>

<p>Whereas we are stating it is just that, a theory.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>it’s not just that though</p>
<p>why is the big bang theory important? because it explains the expansion of space-time from a singularity and the development of the early universe, the universe is still expanding and we can observe the microwave cosmic background from when the universe was only some 380,000 years old where the universe cooled enough that it was no longer opaque and became transparent</p>

<p>which is the theory that a Universe was existent before the last “big bang” (I assume you’ve heard this one, a forever expanding and retracting universe resulting in big bangs and big crunches), meaning it is harder to distinguish whether there was an actual beginning in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>and coming back to my original point, if you had read proper reputable sources to begin with we wouldn’t have this misunderstanding, the big bang theory ONLY explains the development of our universe from a singularity, it does not necessarily contradict the idea of a multiverse</p>
<p>the big bang theory does not explain anything beyond the expansion of space-time and the development of our universe from a singularity, it does not attempt to explain what came before the singularity and/or if anything else is out there (note: what came before the singularity is not an applicable question, note: if anything else is out there is not an applicable question)</p>

<p>So at this point we would forget about the initial big bang theory as a definitive beginning, and realise that maybe, just how a star is born then implodes, then a new star is born within that nebula, that the Universe could be doing this, just on a much larger scale.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>and coming back to what I said a billion times already, the big bang does not explain the definitive beginning</p>
<p>to use your star analogy, the big bang theory would only go as far as to explain what happens after new star is created, it doesn’t explain anything before, or anything outside, it only explains the development of the star</p>
<p>but technically we (probably) cannot know if anything is outside our universe, hence asking if it is isn’t applicable, and technically as far as we know we cannot know if anything came before the singularity, so asking if anything came before that isn’t applicable, science cannot explain these things and any explanation, as far as we know, won’t be a strictly scientific one</p>

You twist my words. I said there was no way to detect gravity. If I sealed you into a room where you cannot observe the area around you. (I will give you food, drink and air).

        <p>Well thanks for taking the time to write all that. I agree 100% with what you said, I guess my terminology is off. My understanding of the definition of a theory was “educated guess or disproved explanation” (no I’ve never looked up the definition).</p>
<p>I watch a lot of documentaries, varying from Brian Cox, Sky at Night, BBC documentaries, Stephen Hawkins, Discovery channel etc. etc., so these are my reputable sources.</p>
<p>I might of been going on a whim on my certainty about “big bang is a definitive beginning theory” and “the other one is a multiverse theory”, but I still find it hard to distinguish the difference between the original big bang theory I was aware of, and your explanation of it (yes it expanded from a singularity, but doesn’t it suggest this was the [i]first[/b] big bang, and a separate theory suggests the big bang was the result of a big crunch).</p>
<p>People talk as if the big bang is the proven fact, but there is no fact as of yet coinciding with the creation of our Universe. I won’t simply wiki it because who’s to say that information is reputable. I’m not arguing your point at all that you kept repeating, I do agree with it, I’m just confused now on the difference between both our opinions on how you define theory.</p>

<p>to me these are the same thing. It would of been the creation of all matter that we see today anyway, whether it was a “definitive beginning” as I keep putting it, or plain and simply expansion of matter from a single point (which I could of added to my explanation to make it “an expansion of matter from a single point that suggests a beginning of our Universe”).</p>
<p>They seem to me like the same thing. Just worded differently.</p>

I see your point also, and yes it’s hard to get our words across in a way we can all understand each other. You are referring to the following concept, am I right?: for example, Astronauts feel like they are floating whilst in a space station orbiting Earth, but in reality they are actually falling towards Earth.</p>

I'm happy that some one says it's just a theory, most people take theories as a fact which is the wrong thing to do.
I don't believe in the big bang theory, just like space has no end I believe there is no beginning or end to it's existence either.[/quote]Of course it's a theory, because we don't truly know how the universe developed. However the theory is supported by many pieces of evidence. It makes the theory more accurate to explain the universe's development. Oh and guess what? It is a theory that majority of the scientific community accepts, not a random "some one."
<p>[quote author=RandQm link=topic=583400.msg4155316#msg4155316 date=1352654868]<br>
I believe it has always been there and always will be.[/quote]<br>
<span class="bbcode-s">That doesn’t make sense, “time” did not exist before the big bang. So it couldn’t have “always been there” and we don’t know according to you!.</span><br>

Yes it does in the area that’s visible for us, that’s what I’m trying to say. We are a little dot on what’s the universe and can only see a dot far, there’s nothing that can prove that expansion is the case everywhere.</p>

<p>and not to be a pain in the ass but the big bang really doesn’t preclude an idea of other universes, or universes before this one</p>
<p>there are ideas that multiple universes can exist, or ideas like the big crunch, all the big bang theory attempts to explain is how the universe may have developed from a singularity, but in all honesty there is absolutely no way we can know if these ideas are true beyond pure speculation</p>

Are you referring to the observable universe? Are you saying that beyond the observable universe, the remaining universe doesn’t expand? If so, why isn’t the night sky bright?</p>
<p>The universe as a whole expands, and it isn’t expanding into anything. There’s nothing outside the universe so in a way, the space you see or don’t see expands.

        <p>[quote=“Rix_, post:70, topic:466633”][quote author=RandQm]I’m talking about the universe not time[/quote]So am I, you would have been able to figure that out if you inferred correctly from what I was talking about. To be clear, the universe couldn’t have always “been there”.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Why wouldn’t it? What makes you so sure it wasn’t always there?</span></p>
<p>[quote author=RandQm]Yes it does in the area that’s visible for us, that’s what I’m trying to say. We are a little dot on what’s the universe and can only see a dot far, there’s nothing that can prove that expansion is the case everywhere.[/quote]I don’t know why I picked up on your point earlier because you don’t make sense. Are you referring to the observable universe? Are you saying that beyond the observable universe, the remaining universe doesn’t expand? If so, why isn’t the night sky bright?<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">I’m saying that beyond what we can observe there can be other bows/bendings? in space,<br>
like said we are only a small dot, it’s not because it’s expanding where we can see and maybe many dots more that this is the case everywhere, we have no clue what’s more out there, we see the universe expanding around us in our observable space, what are we the centre of the universe? don’t think so.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">The universe as a whole expands, and it isn’t expanding into anything</span>. There’s nothing outside the universe so in a way, the space you see or don’t see expands. If you actually read the <span class="bbcode-s">Wikipedia</span> articles to get the gist of what I was trying to say, you wouldn’t have shot me down just like that.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">What makes you so sure? Have you been traveling through space to know?</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Wikipedia? really? How about you go get some books and then come back, english wikipedia is a good source but if you only depend on one source that can be edited you shouldn’t be talking at all.</span></p>

<p>you’re right, he did, because he was quite frankly ahead of his time</p>
<p>einstein had originally predicted that the universe would either be in a state of expansion or contradiction, but the general theories at the time were that the universe was static in size, einstein modified his theories with a cosmological constant to fit the ideas of a static universe and it wasn’t until several years later where hubble had direct proof that the universe was expanding that einstein dropped the idea of a static universe and admitted it was the, and I’m paraphrasing “biggest cock-up of his life”, but just like most good stories there was a twist, with the discovery of an accelerating expansion of the universe in 1998 was einsteins cosmological constant bought back into the mainstream attention</p>
