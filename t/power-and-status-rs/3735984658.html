        <p>This piqued my interest. Honestly I think back. I’m an old hat. This is the only account i still retain here as ive lost others or other circumstances. I actually remember being a part of a server called…now the name escapes me I will remember it later though. I remember playing that when mopar was coming out and becoming an actual community (if you care to call it that).  Back when object training dominated and the people who made the clients where far and few in between. Now theres so many people involved that standing out is now coming down to originality.</p>
<p>The fact that anyone can do it thanks to the help and tutorials of old timers, is what continues the draw. I bet anyone here. If not for mopar, runescape private servers would have died out as a lost cause. Mock me, deny me, whatever. But just keep in mind that time in which pre-r-s. pre dodian. Before Jagex ever cared…not that it does. Mopar was here and was THE place for RSPS.<br>
So when it comes to glory of the power of staff, or a quick thrill at being able to run your own server, it all boils down to the fact that a few years ago a few of us got really interested and learned everything we could from the few who knew. And slowly have branched off teaching others.<br>
Basically my forgone conclusion is.<br>
Without The originals without mopar. RSPS would not exist, not in its present form atleast, probably would be much more primitive.</p>
<p>I realize this is a tad offtopic but your thoughts about going back to then really made me feel the need to express this.</p>
