    <description>Before I start, RSCPS has a discussion thread, why doesn&#39;t RS2PS?

Anyway, just wanted to know your point of view about something (this is regarding anything related to RS only ie. RuneScape, RSPS and associated forums). 

What&#39;s your view on power, authority and/or personal status regarding private servers? Do you feel a sense of importance and well-being managing your own private server? 

You could be a nobody, an average Joe that nobody cares to acknowledge, but as soon as you host your own server and have that gold and shiny crown, people treat you differently. 

Does administration and moderator statuses give people a false sense of behaviour? How do you think people would, if so, change their actions, if administrators and moderators weren&#39;t visibly identifiable?

Anybody can make themself an administrator and host a server. It is not an earnt position, so do you automatically change your behaviour when talking to crowns? 

Do you feel more important having a higher status than the majority, whether it be an administrator on your server or a moderator on these forums? Not so much a &#39;gloating importance&#39; but &#39;self-fullfilled importance&#39;. 

Come on, let&#39;s not be modest here; be honest. We&#39;re all friends.

I&#39;ll admitt, I had a feeling of importance getting my 200 rep. False importance of course, but nevertheless it is different to 10. I don&#39;t want to talk about rep though, I&#39;d rather keep this topic fixated on private servers.

This topic may seem a little odd, but I just wanted to hear some input and discussion from you.

Thanks for reading. Too long; didn&#39;t read? Please try again...</description>

              <p>This piqued my interest. Honestly I think back. I’m an old hat. This is the only account i still retain here as ive lost others or other circumstances. I actually remember being a part of a server called…now the name escapes me I will remember it later though. I remember playing that when mopar was coming out and becoming an actual community (if you care to call it that).  Back when object training dominated and the people who made the clients where far and few in between. Now theres so many people involved that standing out is now coming down to originality.</p>
<p>The fact that anyone can do it thanks to the help and tutorials of old timers, is what continues the draw. I bet anyone here. If not for mopar, runescape private servers would have died out as a lost cause. Mock me, deny me, whatever. But just keep in mind that time in which pre-r-s. pre dodian. Before Jagex ever cared…not that it does. Mopar was here and was THE place for RSPS.<br>
So when it comes to glory of the power of staff, or a quick thrill at being able to run your own server, it all boils down to the fact that a few years ago a few of us got really interested and learned everything we could from the few who knew. And slowly have branched off teaching others.<br>
Basically my forgone conclusion is.<br>
Without The originals without mopar. RSPS would not exist, not in its present form atleast, probably would be much more primitive.</p>
<p>I realize this is a tad offtopic but your thoughts about going back to then really made me feel the need to express this.</p>

I began looking into running my own server a few months later when my friend told me that RSPS were becoming bad, so I thought I’d make a good RSPS with a lot of players on it. Was never obsessed with the Power of actually running a RSPS, it was a just for fun project and it helped me learn a lot about leaching and respecting other peoples work.

<p>Personally, I wouldn’t treat a person differently because of a crown, but IRL your point of view has to change.

You bring up some very good points towards the end, especially</p>
<blockquote>For example, if you are addressed by the president, you'll be unable to tell him to fuck off or something, while an "average Joe that nobody cares to acknowledge" can be raped without anybody caring.</blockquote>
As I always say, we're all human beings. We're all the same, why get treated differently? President being playerRights = 3 and me being playerRights = 0, I'm still the exact same thing he's made of.
<p>I’d never get excited about meeting a President or whatever, they’ve done nothing for me. I’d be excited to meet Michael Jackson though, as he touched me as a kid… touched me inside… <span class="bbcode-i">inspired</span> me, that’s the word I was looking for.</p>

Brilliant. That’s just the sort of reply I was looking for.</p>
<p>I like how at first you set out to be all high and mighty, acheive it and then don’t become the arrogant asshole.</p>

<p>Well, I was happy to have it back since I had it taken away a year or so go, but it’s just a badge.</p>

              <p>There’s something about power that makes people obsessed. Obviously most people here originated at Runescape, and we all know how big of a deal a player mod is over there. Everyone wants that authority over people and the indistinguishable image of the crown. This results in people becoming fanatical about rules and helping people, overdoing it so much. I used to use the RS Forums quiet a bit before my lock, and they had a nice term for these people…“WBM” or wannabe mods.</p>
<p>I could name a few people on these forums who are obviously experiencing this(wanting mod), and it’s obvious they aren’t getting it.</p>
<p>Same goes for servers, power gets to people, etc etc. It’s mostly a 15 and less kinda thing.</p>

              <p>Before I start, RSCPS has a discussion thread, why doesn’t RS2PS?</p>
<p>Anyway, just wanted to know your point of view about something (this is regarding anything related to RS only ie. RuneScape, RSPS and associated forums).</p>
<p>What’s your view on power, authority and/or personal status regarding private servers? Do you feel a sense of importance and well-being managing your own private server?</p>
<p>You could be a nobody, an average Joe that nobody cares to acknowledge, but as soon as you host your own server and have that gold and shiny crown, people treat you differently.</p>
<p>Does administration and moderator statuses give people a false sense of behaviour? How do you think people would, if so, change their actions, if administrators and moderators weren’t visibly identifiable?</p>
<p>Anybody can make themself an administrator and host a server. It is not an earnt position, so do you automatically change your behaviour when talking to crowns?</p>
<p>Do you feel more important having a higher status than the majority, whether it be an administrator on your server or a moderator on these forums? Not so much a ‘gloating importance’ but ‘self-fullfilled importance’.</p>
<p>Come on, let’s not be modest here; be honest. We’re all friends.</p>
<p>I’ll admitt, I had a feeling of importance getting my 200 rep. False importance of course, but nevertheless it is different to 10. I don’t want to talk about rep though, I’d rather keep this topic fixated on private servers.</p>
<p>This topic may seem a little odd, but I just wanted to hear some input and discussion from you.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. Too long; didn’t read? Please try again…</p>
