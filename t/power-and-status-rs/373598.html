        <p>Before I start, RSCPS has a discussion thread, why doesn’t RS2PS?</p>
<p>Anyway, just wanted to know your point of view about something (this is regarding anything related to RS only ie. RuneScape, RSPS and associated forums).</p>
<p>What’s your view on power, authority and/or personal status regarding private servers? Do you feel a sense of importance and well-being managing your own private server?</p>
<p>You could be a nobody, an average Joe that nobody cares to acknowledge, but as soon as you host your own server and have that gold and shiny crown, people treat you differently.</p>
<p>Does administration and moderator statuses give people a false sense of behaviour? How do you think people would, if so, change their actions, if administrators and moderators weren’t visibly identifiable?</p>
<p>Anybody can make themself an administrator and host a server. It is not an earnt position, so do you automatically change your behaviour when talking to crowns?</p>
<p>Do you feel more important having a higher status than the majority, whether it be an administrator on your server or a moderator on these forums? Not so much a ‘gloating importance’ but ‘self-fullfilled importance’.</p>
<p>Come on, let’s not be modest here; be honest. We’re all friends.</p>
<p>I’ll admitt, I had a feeling of importance getting my 200 rep. False importance of course, but nevertheless it is different to 10. I don’t want to talk about rep though, I’d rather keep this topic fixated on private servers.</p>
<p>This topic may seem a little odd, but I just wanted to hear some input and discussion from you.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. Too long; didn’t read? Please try again…</p>

        <p>There’s something about power that makes people obsessed. Obviously most people here originated at Runescape, and we all know how big of a deal a player mod is over there. Everyone wants that authority over people and the indistinguishable image of the crown. This results in people becoming fanatical about rules and helping people, overdoing it so much. I used to use the RS Forums quiet a bit before my lock, and they had a nice term for these people…“WBM” or wannabe mods.</p>
<p>I could name a few people on these forums who are obviously experiencing this(wanting mod), and it’s obvious they aren’t getting it.</p>
<p>Same goes for servers, power gets to people, etc etc. It’s mostly a 15 and less kinda thing.</p>

<p>Well, I was happy to have it back since I had it taken away a year or so go, but it’s just a badge.</p>
<p>It’s not power, it just signifies I’ve been around since pretty much kaitnieks IRC when we were first beginning the “server” concept.</p>

        <p>I think almost everyone wants power or status. You’d be hard fetched to find someone that (honestly) doesn’t like it. There are people that constantly strive to achieve it (like casey said, WBM’s), and other people that don’t care as much.</p>

        <p>I take pride in all that I’ve done and what I continue to do for RuneScape emulation. I take pride in everything I know and my ability to help others. I don’t think that my capabilities and what I’ve done makes me <span class="bbcode-i">better</span> than any other person here, though.</p>
<p>I’m an administrator on my server, but I’m the most laid back administrator on the whole team. My community has one rule because I don’t get anything out of “babysitting” players and making them do things that I want them to do. That’s not what’s important to me. I’m here to kill boredom and to do something that I believe to be worth my time. I like being at a level of understanding to the point where I can use what I know to help others succeed as well.</p>
<p>When I first came here, I had a plan to get to the top, to conquer all of RSPS and to monopolize it. To be the very best at everything, to have an excuse to be an egotistical, arrogant asshole and to have people envy me. Above all, getting to where I am has been a learning experience to me: that the plan I had is not how I want to live my life and interact with others.</p>
<p>So now I just chill here, doing stuff for people when I’m bored and helping out wherever I can. A vast majority of my projects are open-source, and as such a vast majority of my time that I put into RSPS is donated to the communities that taught me RSPS in the first place.</p>
<p>I never sought out MoparScape Vet status or the Java Guru badge. From what I’ve been told, super_ made a veteran poll for me (out of nowhere) and also suggested that I get this Java Guru badge. I didn’t ask for any of it haha, it just sort of happened.</p>

        <p>The reason I first came into programming a RSPS was because my friend called me out of the blue after not talking to me for 6 months and told me to go on this website, that there was a private version of runescape there. I, being a no-life for runescape at the time, decided to go check it out. It was an All-Star base, but the fact it had custom items that were not in RS made it appeal to me. When that one was shut down, I decided to look into making my own, not even knowing the first steps of doing so.</p>
<p>I contacted the owner of the one I was playing, he informed me I would need JDK, suggested to have Notepad++, and even pointed me to a few different websites to get a server and client from. Generally, I was thinking this was going to be a piece of cake, I mean cmon, a 13 year old kid (he is now 16) was hosting this, how hard can it possibly be? I soon learned that this was actually a complicated process. Looked for minor help, for example, making max level to 120 instead of 99, and minor things like this.</p>
<p>When I first opened up with a barely edited base, and only advertising on 2 websites I ended up with 10-20 players logged in regularly. I felt a sense of pride that people were even on something that I was trying to create (edit, or whatever you will). After they started asking for features (after i figured a bunch out), I actually felt a sense of minor importance.</p>
<p>Anyways, these days I help out others when I can, but that’s about it. The entire thing has gotten boring, and nobody seems to care about it when they play anymore, except for its bugs, glitches, and anything else to complain about that is not perfect.</p>

<p>You don’t need just that now these days, who ever knows the most, has the most experience (can be age, or worked for other places), who ever had the best grades, it is a dog fighting field out their and only the most experience and biggest fag can win.</p>

        <p>I first started out RSPS when a friend told me about them. I’d heard about them from before but never bothered to actually try them out. I found an Allstar based server and got addicted to it and I was on it for a long time when it shut down. I began looking into running my own server a few months later when my friend told me that RSPS were becoming bad, so I thought I’d make a good RSPS with a lot of players on it. Was never obsessed with the Power of actually running a RSPS, it was a just for fun project and it helped me learn a lot about leaching and respecting other peoples work. However, I realized that people are more respectful when they see the mod/admin crown so I created another account which was hidden.

<p>Personally, I wouldn’t treat a person differently because of a crown, but IRL your point of view has to change. For example, if you are addressed by the president, you’ll be unable to tell him to fuck off or something, while an “average Joe that nobody cares to acknowledge” can be raped without anybody caring.</p>
<p>I think the best person to be in power is the person that can be respected without having to use that power. If you can still respect him as if he was an ordinary person, then you know you’ve chosen a good leader.</p>

You bring up some very good points towards the end, especially</p>
<blockquote>For example, if you are addressed by the president, you'll be unable to tell him to fuck off or something, while an "average Joe that nobody cares to acknowledge" can be raped without anybody caring.</blockquote>
As I always say, we're all human beings. We're all the same, why get treated differently? President being playerRights = 3 and me being playerRights = 0, I'm still the exact same thing he's made of.
<p>I’d never get excited about meeting a President or whatever, they’ve done nothing for me. I’d be excited to meet Michael Jackson though, as he touched me as a kid… touched me inside… <span class="bbcode-i">inspired</span> me, that’s the word I was looking for.</p>
