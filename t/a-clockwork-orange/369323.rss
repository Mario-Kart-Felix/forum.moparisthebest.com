It&#39;s a film that I&#39;ve always wanted to watch but never managed to. Yesterday I decided fuck it, I have to watch it. The general plot is about a young man called Alex who runs a small gang of 3 &quot;droogs&quot; (which is buddy in Russian). They spend most of their spare time drinking milk mixed with drugs, beating people up (ultra-violence) and raping women (the old in-out). Unfortunately, the protagonist Alex is sentenced for murder for 14 years and this is where the real story picks up. I really don&#39;t want to give away the rest of plot since surprise is a key element that makes the film so good although some people may disagree with me.

It&#39;s one of the strangest and surreal films I&#39;ve ever watched and it has been banned in many countries or rated X. The first 40 minutes of the film is full of brutal beatings and rape. Stanley Kubrick, the director and screenplay writer, does an amazing job creating a dark and mysterious mood along with a couple of light jokes.

The only criticism I have is the ending seems a bit rushed and unfinished. This is no fault of the directors or actors but the fact that the book &quot;A clockwork orange&quot; in the US omits the final chapter and Kubrick never knew about this chapter until the end of the production.

I think it&#39;s dark British cinema at it&#39;s best and I really think you should watch it, even though I bet a load of people already have (especially britfags).</description>
