    <title>[Noname] Project</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/noname-project/356108</link>
    <description>Well after joining [RL] about 10 minutes ago I was banned for Ban evasion due to the fact my other account was banned.
Now I am going to have to start over on writing this thread.

My interest in Runescape and anything involving that subject has decreased rapidly recently. I am now focusing on other subjects that leave Runescape out of it.
I have a Invision Power Board License along with 45-60$ to put into this project.
Along with that I have decided that I am going to work on a general forum.
This general forum will contain many categories of all sorts that will hopefully attract much traffic to the site.
I decided that there will be no homepage or any other add-ons.
It will just be a simple forum that will hopefully be a successful community.
Anyone is free to join in on this Project and Ideas are appreciated.

Note: There is not much information I can supply you with so early in the project,
As it advances and more information is gathered I will be updating this post.</description>
