    <title>Make an item in the shop cost tickets?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/make-an-item-in-the-shop-cost-tickets/478416</link>
    <description>Hey, I have a server that takes tickets for every 1000M a player gets. I now have a shop with rares and stuff in it but I want the cost of the items to be in those 1B tickets, not in coins. Any idea on how I could do that? :) Thanks for reading/helping eveyone.</description>

              <p>What do you mean that doesn’t answer the question? Yes it does. It clearly says to copy and paste the codes from the tokkul shop and change the values it uses. Meaning, change the item id to the one you want to use.</p>

<p>No, and so I don’t come off as a ‘dick’, I’ll list some reasons as to why not:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There are <span class="bbcode-b">multiple</span> Tutorials on how to do this. There have been for ages now. You’re supposed to Search for your answer before you even create a Thread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m not allowed to use Remote Access. Even if I could, I still wouldn’t, because you don’t learn anything from having programmers perform tasks for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This isn’t a spoon-feeding community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must first make an attempt yourself. If you’re unsuccessful, then you post your problem here, and we’ll be more than willing to help.</p>
</li>
</ol>

              <p>Well, one way would be to add a Condition for your “Buy 1, Buy 5, Buy 10, X” Packets, stating that if the Shop I.D = NPC_SHOP; resort the currency to the I.D. of your Tickets.</p>
<p>Another way of doing this, would be to add a Condition to your Shops ‘Main’ Method, stating that if the bought Item = the I.D. of the Item you wish, that the Player must have the Tickets I.D. and the amount you wish.</p>
<p>The best, and most efficient way, would be to re-write your Shops Configuration file to support a slot for your Currency I.D. in accordance to the Shop I.D.</p>
