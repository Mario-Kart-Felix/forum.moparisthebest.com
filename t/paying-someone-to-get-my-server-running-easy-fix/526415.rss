    <title>Paying someone to get my server running, easy fix?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/paying-someone-to-get-my-server-running-easy-fix/526415</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;ve ran servers in the past on my other computer but the computer that I&#39;m on will NOT work. I always get the error &quot;Port is already open blah blah&quot;. I&#39;ve literally tried everything, had atleast 5 people (experienced RSPS owners) try and help me fix it but a few of them said it&#39;s the &quot;Impossible fix error&quot;. 

I&#39;m willing to pay someone $5 to help me fix this.

Cheers.
