    <title>Scroll Bar Color</title>

    <description>I feel like a giant noob having this as my first post but I haven&#39;t had anything to add to other threads...

Well anyway, on with my point. 
I am making graphical changes as well as many new models to my client. I however cannot find any way to change the color of the scroll bar.

Sorry for being a complete noob, but here&#39;s an image if you didn&#39;t under stand the above.</description>
