    <title>[Help] With test scape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-test-scape/30415</link>
    <description>When i try to log in, it freezes in a black screen, First time that  happened, should have benn because of an invalid item id, so i done another char and turned into admin and continued playing, and than, suddly after i used ::fish to go to the fountain, i logged of and logged on again, and it happened again, taht black screen.
The strange thing is, if there is no one connected (internet not on) it works, and if it has people it doesnt work, i guess if i change the name off account will work, but id like to know if thaths a bug and if there is a fix to it
Thanks</description>
