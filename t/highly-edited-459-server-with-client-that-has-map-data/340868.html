        <p>[size=10pt]Hello everyone.</p>
<p>Yes i have a source i have been working on for about a month now. And i was thinking about releasing it. I used Skully’s Project annilihation base and coded off of it. It has many of things. Here are some things below.</p>
<p>Fully coded random events!! - Thanks to Nexus for this.</p>
<p>All shops located all around Varrock.<br>
Varrock guide in the center of Varrock.<br>
New money making - Mining ess, selling to Aubury.<br>
No need to weild anything to do the skill.<br>
-EX: You are a skiller, 41 wcing, you dont need to equip the rune axe.<br>
New shops, located at:<br>
-Varrock sword shop = Pking Shop.<br>
-Varrock armor shop = armor sets shop.<br>
-Brian’s archery shop = Elite ranging shop.</p>
<p>Lag handler made 100%.<br>
Clicking objects will access the database.<br>
The server has an amount for each item: no duping.<br>
Fixed 3049 glitches.<br>
Fixed red skull as a tree.<br>
Full skills.<br>
90% construction. (Just cant build chairs and stuff.)<br>
New stores.<br>
All stores located in Varrock.</p>
<p>Full dueling! With staking, friendly, no food, no pots, etc.<br>
Client is a million times better than the one before.<br>
New sprites.<br>
New interfaces.<br>
New chat logs, pm logs, etc.<br>
Pming is now changeable (on chat interface, on game interface.)<br>
Processes, like stopprocess.java, handler.java, etc. All made from scratch.<br>
All skills work 90-100%! Except for hunting and construction (which are both about 30-40%.)</p>
<h2>All skillcapes work. 100% RS style.<br>
The whole RS world is used.<br>
100% NPC spawn, no lagging.<br>
Godwars redone, now in the proper places.<br>
Took out all custom items (Lukas doesn’t like them, neither do I.)<br>
100% barrows (with key to chest, higher kill count, better reward.)<br>
New client, much better then the one before.<br>
No lag, because of lag handler.<br>
Server resets will be announced 10 minutes before.<br>
100% smithing.<br>
100% fletching.<br>
100% mining, woodcutting.<br>
90% firemaking (1 glitch, won’t say which.)<br>

100% magic (telegrab, teleblock, entangle, etc.)<br>
100% herblore.<br>
100% farming.<br>
Base on hunting.<br>
Base on construction.<br>
All skillcapes, like in RS.<br>
Crazy pking.<br>
Awesome skilling.<br>
Added alot of crap that you won’t notice.<br>
Alot of things that will make coding for me a million times easier.<br>
Super anti-duper system (yeah, you bet that rhymes.)<br>
Really fast item selecting.<br>
Totally remade bank.</h2>
<p>Fully working smithing.</p>
<p>Player handler.<br>
New thieving base.<br>
90% Barrows.<br>
Godwars remake.<br>

16 dupes found in dupe handler, all patched.<br>
Slayer 98%.<br>

New boss animations.<br>
All NPC respawn times changed.<br>
Xlog fix, 40 seconds wait if you xlog.<br>
Perfect PVP.<br>
Perfect PVN.<br>
Working on adding smilies to client (side job).<br>
No other clients will work with the server.<br>
Arrows drop when shot.<br>
Multi barrage added.<br>
80% autofire cannon added.<br>
Farming fully released.<br>
Alot of stuff you won’t notice, but make a big difference.<br>
New bank system, items fill empty spots when re-opened.</p>
<p>And A lot more than that. Also i have the map data which a lot of people cant find. So thats a plus.</p>
<p>But before i release it i want to start another server, and i am to lazy to code and i dont want to put this one up cause i wasnt planning on hosting it anyways. But i want to make a trade.</p>
<p>I would love for someone to give me a 317 server with a perfect or good economy and i want all the skills to work. With 100% perfect combat. No custom items like a black phat or death cape. But pking armor and wepons is fine. But i would like to get something like that.</p>
<p>If you can provide this add my Msn: <a href="mailto:Swaidcbk@hotmail.com">Swaidcbk@hotmail.com</a> and talk to me. Once i get a source with this i might release it is up to the person that gives me the source.</p>
<p>I hope i can find someone with the correct additude.</p>
<p>Also i have the Shilo Village source if anyone wants that.!!![/size]</p>
