    <description>[size=10pt]Hello everyone. 

Yes i have a source i have been working on for about a month now. And i was thinking about releasing it. I used Skully&#39;s Project annilihation base and coded off of it. It has many of things. Here are some things below.

Fully coded random events!! - Thanks to Nexus for this.

All shops located all around Varrock.
Varrock guide in the center of Varrock.
New money making - Mining ess, selling to Aubury.
No need to weild anything to do the skill.
 -EX: You are a skiller, 41 wcing, you dont need to equip the rune axe.
New shops, located at:
 -Varrock sword shop = Pking Shop.
 -Varrock armor shop = armor sets shop.
 -Brian&#39;s archery shop = Elite ranging shop.

Lag handler made 100%.
Clicking objects will access the database.
The server has an amount for each item: no duping.
Fixed 3049 glitches.
Fixed red skull as a tree.
Full skills.
90% construction. (Just cant build chairs and stuff.)
New stores.
All stores located in Varrock.

Full dueling! With staking, friendly, no food, no pots, etc.
Client is a million times better than the one before.
New sprites.
New interfaces.
New chat logs, pm logs, etc.
Pming is now changeable (on chat interface, on game interface.)
Processes, like stopprocess.java, handler.java, etc. All made from scratch.
All skills work 90-100%! Except for hunting and construction (which are both about 30-40%.)

All skillcapes work. 100% RS style.
The whole RS world is used.
100% NPC spawn, no lagging.
Godwars redone, now in the proper places.
Took out all custom items (Lukas doesn&#39;t like them, neither do I.)
100% barrows (with key to chest, higher kill count, better reward.)
New client, much better then the one before.
No lag, because of lag handler.
Server resets will be announced 10 minutes before.
100% smithing.
100% fletching.
100% mining, woodcutting.
90% firemaking (1 glitch, won&#39;t say which.)
Real RS quests (almost all of them done).
Full fishing.
100% magic (telegrab, teleblock, entangle, etc.)
100% herblore.
100% farming.
Base on hunting.
Base on construction.
All skillcapes, like in RS.
Crazy pking.
Awesome skilling.
Added alot of crap that you won&#39;t notice.
Alot of things that will make coding for me a million times easier.
Super anti-duper system (yeah, you bet that rhymes.)
Really fast item selecting.
Totally remade bank.
 --------------
Fully working smithing.

Player handler.
New thieving base.
90% Barrows.
Godwars remake.
Kilyana slower respawn.
Farming 100% (Will add shops).
16 dupes found in dupe handler, all patched.
Slayer 98%.
Auto cache downloader.
Client updater.
New boss animations.
All NPC respawn times changed.
Xlog fix, 40 seconds wait if you xlog.
Perfect PVP.
Perfect PVN.
Working on adding smilies to client (side job).
No other clients will work with the server.
Arrows drop when shot.
Multi barrage added.
80% autofire cannon added.
Farming fully released.
Alot of stuff you won&#39;t notice, but make a big difference.
New bank system, items fill empty spots when re-opened.

And A lot more than that. Also i have the map data which a lot of people cant find. So thats a plus.

But before i release it i want to start another server, and i am to lazy to code and i dont want to put this one up cause i wasnt planning on hosting it anyways. But i want to make a trade.

I would love for someone to give me a 317 server with a perfect or good economy and i want all the skills to work. With 100% perfect combat. No custom items like a black phat or death cape. But pking armor and wepons is fine. But i would like to get something like that.

If you can provide this add my Msn: Swaidcbk@hotmail.com and talk to me. Once i get a source with this i might release it is up to the person that gives me the source.

I hope i can find someone with the correct additude.

Also i have the Shilo Village source if anyone wants that.!!!![/size]</description>
