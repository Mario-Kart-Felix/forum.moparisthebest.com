    <title>How To Join Servers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-join-servers/86621</link>
    <description>[b]Purpose: [/b][i]To get onto Servers[/i]

[b]Difficulty: [/b][i]1/10[/i]

[b]Assumed Knowledge: [/b][i]Downloading, Using Links, Installing[/i]

[b]Server Base: [/b][i]None[/i]

[b]Classes Modified: [/b][i]None[/i]

[b][u]Procedure[/u][/b]

[b]Step 1: [/b][i]You may not know this, but there are two ways to go on Private Servers. One way is using the Webclient of MoparScape. To use this go to [url=http://moparisthebest.com]moparisthebest.com[/url]:
[IMG]http://img242.imageshack.us/img242/7782/moparscapewebclientie5.png[/img]Or you can download the MoparScape Client [url=http://uppit.com/NCD3S]Here[/url]
[IMG]http://img248.imageshack.us/img248/8634/moparscapeclientvd9.png[/img]
If you chose to Download the Client you must Install it and use the correct Icon.[/i]

[b]Step 2: [/b][i]Now you must find an Online Server at [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,50.0.html]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,50.0.html[/url]. Just find a decent Server Topic and look around in it to see if it is online. Now here&#39;s the part where we can actually play it!
Example Picture:
[IMG]http://img243.imageshack.us/img243/1042/dragonscapev2examplefi1.png[/img][/i]

[b]Step 3: [/b][i]First off you must know the Server IP. Some are in numbers or some are like this: dragonscape.no-ip.org, dragonscape.servegame.info, etc.
Shown in the Red Box below is the Server IP:
[IMG]http://img403.imageshack.us/img403/8084/dragonscapev2examplebc6.png[/img]
Now that you know the Server IP, you must enter it into the MoparScape Client. First click File at the Top-Left Corner and click New Server. Now enter the Server IP provided from the Owner of that Server. Here is an example of this process:
[IMG]http://img143.imageshack.us/img143/4293/moparscapeserveripexampun8.png[/img]
Now just click Okay and your ready for the next step![/i]

[b]Step 4: [/b][i]Now you have to know the Port Number! If the Port Number of the Server you chose is Default or 43594 then you can skip this Step. There are many Port Numbers you can find like 5555, 1234, etc. Shown in the Red Box below is the Port Number:
[IMG]http://img172.imageshack.us/img172/8937/dragonscapev2exampleporzk2.png[/img]
You can see that the Port Number is Default/43594 but that is an example, you would not have to do anything for the Port Number if it was Default/43594. But for now just think of it as 5555! Now that you know the Port Number, you must enter it into the MoparScape Client. To do this click File on the Top-Left Corner and click New Port. Now enter the Port provided by the Owner of that Server. Here is an example of this process:
[IMG]http://img249.imageshack.us/img249/5070/moparscapeportnumberpp8.png[/img]
Now just click Okay and you can now join the server by clicking Enter and typing in any Username and Password and just clicking Login! By the way you must enter in the Default Port Number (43594) if you have decided to go to another server and it&#39;s port is Default.
NOTE: If the server you want to join is Hamachi Only, you must go to the Next Step![/i]

[b]Step 5: [/b][i]So the server you want to join is Hamachi Only eh? Well after you have finished the Steps before thise you can use this Step. First you must Download and Install Hamachi. To download Hamachi go to this link: 
[url=http://www.hamachi.cc/download/]http://www.hamachi.cc/download/[/url] (Just skip the Registration). Here is how it should look before logging into it after you have Downloaded and Installed it:
[IMG]http://img248.imageshack.us/img248/8227/hamachiexampleyt6.png[/img]
Now here&#39;s the part where you join the Server Network(s). Shown below in the Red Box is the Network Name and Password:
[IMG]http://img263.imageshack.us/img263/8553/dragonscapehamachinetwoyr5.png[/img]
Now that you know the Network Name(s) and Password you can enter it into Hamachi. I am very sorry but Hamachi right now is not working for me so in the red box below will show you where to go to Join the Network:
[IMG]http://img338.imageshack.us/img338/600/hamachjoininganetworkexen6.png[/img]
Now enter the Hamachi Network name and make sure you typed it in right because it is CaSe SeNsItIvE. Now type in the password (It will say but it is usually 123 or the name of the server). You may need to try another network of that Server if that one is Full. Now that you are connected you can start playing! [/i]

[b]Step 6: [/b][i]Feel like playing alone? Well this is very easy, all you have to do is click Start Server and then OK. Now just click Enter and enter a Username and Password then just Login and your all set! Here is an example of the process below:
[IMG]http://img340.imageshack.us/img340/3385/moparscapeclientplayingal1.png[/img] 
Thanks for using this Tutorial for help! Enjoy playing alone or with others![/i]


[b]Credits: [/b][i]The whole MoparScape Team, Hamachi, Me for writing out this Tutorial[/i] 

Note To The Moderators: Please do not Lock this topic, I&#39;ve worked REALLY hard on this even if that is hard to believe. I&#39;ve put much effort into this also. I&#39;ve seen someone post this except there were three steps, each of them containing 1-3 words. It&#39;s basically spam that they posted. But the most reason I made this Tutorial is to put a stop to Newbies spamming other Topics or Forums just to find out how to do this. Thanks for your time!

<img src="http://img248.imageshack.us/img248/8634/moparscapeclientvd9.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
If you chose to Download the Client you must Install it and use the correct Icon.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 2: </span><span class="bbcode-i">Now you must find an Online Server at <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,50.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,50.0.html</a>. Just find a decent Server Topic and look around in it to see if it is online. Now here’s the part where we can actually play it!<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 3: </span><span class="bbcode-i">First off you must know the Server IP. Some are in numbers or some are like this: <a href="http://dragonscape.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">dragonscape.no-ip.org</a>, dragonscape.servegame.info, etc.<br>
Shown in the Red Box below is the Server IP:<br>
<img src="http://img403.imageshack.us/img403/8084/dragonscapev2examplebc6.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
Now that you know the Server IP, you must enter it into the MoparScape Client. First click File at the Top-Left Corner and click New Server. Now enter the Server IP provided from the Owner of that Server. Here is an example of this process:<br>
<img src="http://img143.imageshack.us/img143/4293/moparscapeserveripexampun8.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
Now just click Okay and your ready for the next step!</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 4: </span><span class="bbcode-i">Now you have to know the Port Number! If the Port Number of the Server you chose is Default or 43594 then you can skip this Step. There are many Port Numbers you can find like 5555, 1234, etc. Shown in the Red Box below is the Port Number:<br>
<img src="http://img172.imageshack.us/img172/8937/dragonscapev2exampleporzk2.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
You can see that the Port Number is Default/43594 but that is an example, you would not have to do anything for the Port Number if it was Default/43594. But for now just think of it as 5555! Now that you know the Port Number, you must enter it into the MoparScape Client. To do this click File on the Top-Left Corner and click New Port. Now enter the Port provided by the Owner of that Server. Here is an example of this process:<br>
<img src="http://img249.imageshack.us/img249/5070/moparscapeportnumberpp8.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
Now just click Okay and you can now join the server by clicking Enter and typing in any Username and Password and just clicking Login! By the way you must enter in the Default Port Number (43594) if you have decided to go to another server and it’s port is Default.<br>
NOTE: If the server you want to join is Hamachi Only, you must go to the Next Step!</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 5: </span><span class="bbcode-i">So the server you want to join is Hamachi Only eh? Well after you have finished the Steps before thise you can use this Step. First you must Download and Install Hamachi. To download Hamachi go to this link:<br>
<a href="http://www.hamachi.cc/download/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.hamachi.cc/download/</a> (Just skip the Registration). Here is how it should look before logging into it after you have Downloaded and Installed it:<br>

Now here’s the part where you join the Server Network(s). Shown below in the Red Box is the Network Name and Password:<br>

Now that you know the Network Name(s) and Password you can enter it into Hamachi. I am very sorry but Hamachi right now is not working for me so in the red box below will show you where to go to Join the Network:<br>

Now enter the Hamachi Network name and make sure you typed it in right because it is CaSe SeNsItIvE. Now type in the password (It will say but it is usually 123 or the name of the server). You may need to try another network of that Server if that one is Full. Now that you are connected you can start playing! </span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 6: </span><span class="bbcode-i">Feel like playing alone? Well this is very easy, all you have to do is click Start Server and then OK. Now just click Enter and enter a Username and Password then just Login and your all set! Here is an example of the process below:<br>

Thanks for using this Tutorial for help! Enjoy playing alone or with others!</span></p>

<p>Note To The Moderators: Please do not Lock this topic, I’ve worked REALLY hard on this even if that is hard to believe. I’ve put much effort into this also. I’ve seen someone post this except there were three steps, each of them containing 1-3 words. It’s basically spam that they posted. But the most reason I made this Tutorial is to put a stop to Newbies spamming other Topics or Forums just to find out how to do this. Thanks for your time!</p>
