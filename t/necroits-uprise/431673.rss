SURVIVAL



Necroits Uprise: The return of the Necroits Minecraft server.


Getting started

After opening your minecraft or spoutcraft client. Click multiplayer.
Make your way to the server by using either of the following IP&#39;s:

Empire.Necroits.Info
Uprise.Necroits.Info

Now that you are in the server you must register.

/register &lt;password&gt; &lt;retypepassword&gt;
/login &lt;password&gt;
/logout
/changepassword &lt;oldpassword&gt; &lt;newpassword&gt;
/unregister &lt;password&gt;

Now you can move and talk. Say hi to everyone!

I suppose you want to start getting wood and building your house or whatever.

Might as well get paid for it.

JOBS

use &quot;/jobs browse&quot; to look for a job.

When you see one that looks interesting. Look at the information required to do the jobs and how much it pays.
Use &quot;/jobs info [job name]&quot; You can now see income you get for placing, killing and breaking blocks. Also job experience.

Ready to join the job? Type &quot;/jobs join [job name]&quot; You can have up to 3 jobs at once.

Dont like the job? Type &quot;/jobs leave [Jobname]&quot;

Ok got your job to get money. Now you&#39;re ready to work. But where to go?

MAP

I have provided one awesome map that shows you like... everything. Look up and a little to your left and click that map tab to open your map.

Look at that you see red blocks, you see monster faces, you see people&#39;s faces and everything built!
Ok calm down. The red blocks are towns (will explain that epicness later)

The monster faces are the monsters and the player faces are the players. IT&#39;S ALL REAL TIME!
(Except for towns. Takes a bit for the map to register when you claimed or unclaimed land.)

Now... you see that weird rectangle of land that seems to be smack down out of nowhere in the middle of the map.
That is all flatlands. It is nothing but grass, dirt, and stone/cobble. No ores so dont bother mining there for ores. That areas is meant for building. Ores will be on the outside of flatlands.

So you got some dirt/wood/stone or whatever and you made your thing or are in the process of making it. But dont want no one to steal or break your stuff.

TOWNS

Towns. The back bone of civilization. Your land is protected from outsiders and you are safe from monsters. You can increase the size of your town by adding residents or buying bonus plots.

Stand in an area that you want to claim.
Type &quot;/t new [Town Name]&quot;

It will claim a 16x16 area (Chunk) And you will have 8 plots with 7 being unused.
You will need to deposit money. See how much money you have using &quot;/money&quot;

Then deposit some into the town&#39;s bank. &quot;/t deposit [Amount]&quot;

Now you can claim more laind. To claim more land go into a wilderness plot that is next to your already claimed plot and type &quot;/t claim&quot;

Need more plots? Buy them using &quot;/t buy [amount]&quot;

Any more town help? Type &quot;/t ?&quot;</description>
