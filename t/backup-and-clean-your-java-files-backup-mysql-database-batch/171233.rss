This batch file should be standard for every source. Our communities are full of messy code, and constant errors. This will fix the messiness and will help create backups so you can start where you left off after an error. The first thing this program will do is clean your code. Clean does not mean fix errors. This will correctly space your code, and keep it up to par with java standards. The second thing this does is create a backup of your java files. They are moved to backup/date/*.java. The next and last thing that this program does is optional. If you have a MySQL database, this will back it up in backup/date/database.txt. You can later restore this database by emptying your current one and running the code. Sometimes, in a rare occurrence, the program will not successfully create the new clean file, because your file contains an illegal character. It will help you remove the illegal character.

[b][size=20pt][anchor=use]How To Use/Setup[/anchor][/size][/b]
First, open the file you downloaded earlier in the thread. You need a compression program such as [url=http://rarlabs.com/rar/wrar371.exe]WinRAR[/url] to open it. Extract it to your server source folder. You should have a file called &quot;Backup and Beautify.bat&quot; (You can rename it if you want). Right click it and click edit. 
[b]If you use MySQL:[/b]
Fill in this piece of code(Please note there is no space between -p and password:
[left][sub][i]for /f &quot;tokens=1-5 delims=/ &quot; %%d in (&quot;%date%&quot;) do &quot;C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.0\bin\mysqldump.exe&quot; -u USERNAME -pPASSWORD DATABASE&gt; BACKUP/%%e-%%f-%%g/database.sql[/i]
[/sub][/left]
[b]If you don&#39;t use MySQL:[/b]
Delete this:[left][sub][i]cls
title Backing up mysql database! - By Mike Vartan
echo Finished beautifying and backing up files
echo Now attempting to backup the database
for /f &quot;tokens=1-5 delims=/ &quot; %%d in (&quot;%date%&quot;) do &quot;C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.0\bin\mysqldump.exe&quot; -u root -pdickfart runescape &gt; BACKUP/%%e-%%f-%%g/database.sql
echo.

echo done![/i][/sub][/left]

[b][size=20pt][anchor=faq]F.A.Q.[/anchor][/size][/b]
[left]1. [b]Will this fix my java error?[/b]
1. [i]No this won&#39;t. This helps your code follow common conventional standards. Will fix spacing and other things like that.[/i]
2. [b]Can this delete anything?[/b]
2. [i]At no point does this program delete any file, it only moves them, so there is no way it could delete anything.[/i]

Jacobe.exe was created by [url=http://www.tiobe.com/jacobe.htm]Tiobe[/url]. The batch file and all in it were made 100% by me. The virus scan screenshot was taken by Madman. Thank MediaFire for hosting, and i recommend it for 100% of your uploading needs.</description>
