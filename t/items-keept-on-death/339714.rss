    <description>ok im running a 317 delta based server and i on my client i have an item for items keept on death. when i click it nothing happens but button is 58254
i was wondering if there was a way if i could make it to where it showed what 0 1,3,4 items you keep on death (4 and 1 if you protect have prayer). i dont need the interface to pop up just a message saying what you keep. if someone could plz help with the codes that would be great. or another method to view items keept on death.
