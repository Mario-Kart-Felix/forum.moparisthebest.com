    <description>I know it&#39;s pointless, that&#39;s the beauty of SCAR.
It&#39;s kind of like a new programming language, I guess. I think I&#39;ve made it rather easy to add new commands to, it currently has 3. The script reads a text file line by line like a script, and runs accordingly. It&#39;s easy to crash the script, but oh well. I&#39;ve also attached an example script. Set your text file path up the top, some feedback would be nice. :)

[code]
// So far there are three commands:

//    _ MoveM - Just like MoveMouse
//            Usage: MoveM x,y
//               eg: MoveM 145,608

//    _ Wait  - Just like Wait
//            Usage: Wait i
//               eg: Wait 5000

//    _ Print - Just like Writeln
//            Usage: Print s
//               eg: Print This is my sTrInG! :)

//  To add new commands, create a procedure in this section, such
//  as Procedure Command_GetColour(s: String). &quot;s&quot; contains the parameters
//  that are passed from the text file, so you can split them up as needed
//  in the procedure you make. Then shove a quick line in the Compute
//  function and you&#39;re done.
