    <title>Which software license to pick</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-software-license-to-pick/550491</link>
    <description>For my current project I&#39;m working on, I want the initial public release to have a specific license, so that all updates going forward follow the same guidelines. But I&#39;m not sure which license to pick. I&#39;ve looked at the Unlicense, GPLv3, AGPLv3, CC-BY. They&#39;re all kind of similar, but I&#39;m just a little bit blurry on some details.

People can take my source code and modify it, distribute it, for commercial or non-commercial use. They attribute the original source to me, with (maybe) a link to the original repo. They don&#39;t have to release their source code if they don&#39;t want to. If they use someone else&#39;s derived work that&#39;s licensed, then they have to state what they&#39;re using, as well as a link to their code, with attribution for them.

For example, my project &lt;Foo&gt;, Bob takes &lt;Foo&gt;, makes his changes to it, and distributes it under and open-source license and releases it publicly as &lt;Bar&gt;. Joe, takes &lt;Bar&gt;, modifies it for his server, but doesn&#39;t want to make his source code public, because he&#39;s got a feature that no other server has, and uses it to draw attention. However, Bob requires attribution for &lt;Bar&gt;, so, while Joe doesn&#39;t need to release his code, he does need to say &quot;I got my code from Zymus&#39;s &lt;Foo&gt; &lt;link&gt;, and using version 3 of Bob&#39;s &lt;Foo&gt; plugin&quot;.

Is there something that kind of matches with this? Or is there some exclusive term that I need to modify.

EDIT: Actually, there&#39;s not reason I should restrict how Bob can use his code, so disregard that part.</description>

<p>So this means that Joe couldn’t ever have his own private code, that he doesn’t share, correct?</p>

              <p>For my current project I’m working on, I want the initial public release to have a specific license, so that all updates going forward follow the same guidelines. But I’m not sure which license to pick. I’ve looked at the Unlicense, GPLv3, AGPLv3, CC-BY. They’re all kind of similar, but I’m just a little bit blurry on some details.</p>
<p>People can take my source code and modify it, distribute it, for commercial or non-commercial use. They attribute the original source to me, with (maybe) a link to the original repo. They don’t have to release their source code if they don’t want to. If they use someone else’s derived work that’s licensed, then they have to state what they’re using, as well as a link to their code, with attribution for them.</p>
<p>For example, my project , Bob takes , makes his changes to it, and distributes it under and open-source license and releases it publicly as . Joe, takes , modifies it for his server, but doesn’t want to make his source code public, because he’s got a feature that no other server has, and uses it to draw attention. However, Bob requires attribution for , so, while Joe doesn’t need to release his code, he does need to say “I got my code from Zymus’s  , and using version 3 of Bob’s  plugin”.</p>
<p>Is there something that kind of matches with this? Or is there some exclusive term that I need to modify.</p>
<p>EDIT: Actually, there’s not reason I should restrict how Bob can use his code, so disregard that part.</p>
