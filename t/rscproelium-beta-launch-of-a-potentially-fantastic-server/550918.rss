    <title>RSCProelium - Beta launch of a potentially fantastic server</title>

    <description>[url=http://rscproelium.net/]RSCProelium - Runescape Classic Server[/url]

[url=http://rscproelium.net/client/Loader.jar]Client download[/url]

RSCProelium is a pretty blank starting point with a remarkably well written framework and great API making it easier to avoid bugs, and attend to them easier if they occur.
It has the usual skills(Most of them at this point, few left I&#39;ve not put in or need minor fixes or adjustments), it is REMARKABLY low latency, it has been stress tested with 8000 remote logins spamming chat every 3 seconds with no lag whatsoever to normal players.

Overall, it is a highly well performing server.

Forum name and password will be the same as in-game name and password.

This is the beta launch to work out any existing bugs in the server.

The server&#39;s XP rate is 10000x.(There will be a wipe once beta is finished)
You get free mage and melee gear, or food, from master fisher.(There will be a wipe once beta is finished)

Portal takes you to dmaze, and back.

I redid the bank GUI entirely

What I&#39;m looking for beyond bug reports during this beta is SUGGESTIONS, on where to place NPCs, on what KIND of server we&#39;re going for(high XP, low XP, quests, completely custom items, NPCs, hairstyles, etc?)
Generalized decisions on what you guys want this server to be, really.  Lots and lots of polls.

The website is currently in development as well.  I am taking a new approach to how the website is handled.  The webserver will be integrated into the gameserver for easy portability, for better integration(online count etc), and more secure administration.  It should perform good as well, once ready.</description>

<p>I never sold that source, but Cirno was mine yea.  This one is significantly more stable and has much less bugs and a far more high performance server with better underlying API, and isn’t based on Cirno code at all except in minor things.<br>

<p>Also, notice the dates from the start of that cirno thread to when you state that you have officially moved on from it.  The server was not online 2 months and then shut down, I don’t wanna waste my time with that.[/quote]<br>
CirnoPK was up for at least half a year, and we only discontinued it because the source was incredibly buggy, nobody was playing for a month or two prior to shutdown, and my grandma who was head of my household at the time had passed.<br>
CirnoPK was up til at least April of 2014.</p>
<p>RSCProelium beta is down at the moment whilst I am rewriting the website, but this project is still active, so that you all know.</p>
<p>EDIT: It is back online, but the site is only partially finished.</p>

<p>Uh, I mean, from what Gil wants to do it seems like I’ll be making it like pp2p except it won’t be spaghetti code and I’m rewriting every feature that goes in(my codebase isn’t even compatible with any old code from other servers). so it’ll have my touch on it all I’m sure.<br>
We’re thinking something like 30x for XP right now I believe.</p>

<p>hey pyru why dont you focus on making your money grabbing sh*t server better instead of trying to put this guy down…i cant wait til a new server takes rsce out of the picture because you are so corrupt and other people are catching on to that</p>

<p>What are your server specifications? Because if I recall correctly, you said RuneScape Classic servers take nothing to run (server spec wise), and spending more than $10 a month is foolish.</p>
<p>Are you targeting EU players? Naturally, as you stated, North American and non EU players will have a higher ping to your server. Increased delay on in-game actions will have a positive effect, but so will 200+MS ping in a negative/noticeable way, regardless of the speed of your in-game commands / actions.</p>

<p>They do take nothing to run spec wise, but this box was given to me by a friend to do with as I please and is rented for the next year I believe, so I really did not get to be too picky with specs or how much he dropped on it.<br>
I didn’t choose the location, I would have chosen US.</p>
<p>I don’t believe the current ping from USA-&gt;EU box is noticeable at all in-game, and have gotten nothing but compliments on the smoothness apart from the 3-5 DDoS incidents since I’ve posted it here.  It’s within tolerable range, for certain.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>USA -&gt; EU at 200+ MS is definitely noticeable, especially for pkers, who expect instant click delays. Nonetheless, a larger scale test, will prove how smooth it really is. Good luck.[/quote]<br>
I have no clue what just USA-&gt;EU is though, the pictures were taken while as usual I was tunneling all of my traffic through Russia.  You know that I do that, though <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
Compliments on latency have been from fins and ests so far so we will indeed see how US PKers like it when the time comes, for sure.</p>
