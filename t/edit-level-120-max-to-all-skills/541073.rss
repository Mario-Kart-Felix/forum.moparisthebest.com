    <title>Edit level 120 max to all skills?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/edit-level-120-max-to-all-skills/541073</link>
    <description>Right now if you set the max to 120 all skills, you get a lot of 120/99, but 120/120 dung.

And I presume it&#39;s client sided because the extra 21 levels for dung are coded into the client so that it can track the exp for leveling and whatnot.

So, how can I make it so every skill can be maxed to 120?

Ok, so I need the interface ids for each of the skills and also how do I make the leveling orbs to show up on the screen after 99 for each skill because right now only dung shows after 99. And also when you hover over the skill it shows the remaining and next level values for dung after 99 but other skills after 99 its gone, so I need to add it manually.</description>

<p>Linking me stuff to do with 317s when I’m working on a 718 doesn’t help much. I don’t want to force anything. It wouldn’t display the XP remaining, no one would know when they’re almost the next level after 99 unless they’ve memorized all the level experiences.</p>

<p>You didn’t tell us you were working with a 718. So I assumed 317 and went from there. Maybe you should learn how to post a better topic to receive better help.</p>

Wrong, so wrong. Any server could “support showing xp till level in the Skills tab”. and I mean ANY. It’s just sending another line of text, or you could edit the client script for it to do the math for you.</p>

<p>I think this community is full of people that have coding experience limited to the lower revisions that Moparscape started from.

I didn’t even read that whole thing you just said but i’m telling you now that 718’s have the interface text editor packet on them. I just don’'t know the code for it because you are using a 718. I looked for you and it may be this.</p>

Anyone know the ids for each skill for in the skill tab? The id for where it shows the xp remaining, etc? So I just got to force it to show that line even at 99 until 120 for all skills basically. If you’re right and I just have to force each line to appear after 99, then I should be able to get it to display without editing the cache I guess. That must be where that information is stored the default values shown before you replace it.</p>

              <p>Linking me stuff to do with 317s when I’m working on a 718 doesn’t help much. I don’t want to force anything. It wouldn’t display the XP remaining, no one would know when they’re almost the next level after 99 unless they’ve memorized all the level experiences.</p>
<p>Well, at least you’re at least acknowledging it has the potential to be clientsided, or at least a client script like you described. Now if I can just figure out how to edit it.</p>
<p>Yes, I did see that script called. And I wondered what it was. Could potentially be it. Though, that’s why I’m unsure since I cannot find out without knowing where to look.</p>
<p>And I initially posted in server help because I wasn’t sure. I’ve made the same post in client help now. Perhaps it was a mistake to put it here, everyone insists it’s server-sided, I just thought I would get some thought into it, perhaps I was wrong, but it seems like I’m not, it is indeed something other than server… I wasn’t sure at first, but when everyone came in claiming it’s server sided, then saying to look at places I’ve already looked and already patched to make all skills 120 max, but not in Skills Tab, now I am more convinced that it’s client related.</p>
<p>Unless DAn is right, which is possible. The problem is I cannot find where the strings for the levels are sent to the client for it to display the denominator in Skills Tab. Though, I don’t remember anywhere in the server files where it actually sends any strings/variables to the skills interface. I’m sure it’s like a client script that Sk8r is talking about, because you start out 1/1 everything by default, and it automatically changes it as it detects a level up, and it tracks your experience, probably client-sided/scripted.</p>
<p>But specifically, that location doesn’t seem to have anything to do with allowing it to display 120. Like I said, I already tried setting it to 120. Nothing. Secondly, take a look at the name of the actual declaration:<br>
getWearingSkillRequiriments()</p>
<p>Does that sound like the Skills Tab to you? It seems like you have a knack for missing the actual meaningful aspects of code.</p>
<p>You’re just jumping from one thing to another, each time claiming it’s obviously that reason. When it’s not. I get it though, many people test by trial and error, but I’ve already tried all of those things.</p>

              <p>Hey. You’re forgetting something. One thing that’s <span class="bbcode-b">HUGE</span> in clients. They’re called scripts.<br>
See this code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>More specifically, this: clientScriptData.get(277);<br>
That’s calling a script. What the script does, I personally don’t know since I’m not the one that put it there (Nor am I good with clients). So for all you know is your issue could be packed into one of the various scripts in your client, and we don’t even see it.</p>
<p>Also, if you’re so damn sure this is <span class="bbcode-b">client sided</span> then why are you asking in the Server Help section. It would make sense if you posted in the <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,138.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Client Help</a> section so that someone that is good with <span class="bbcode-u">clients</span> may help you with your <span class="bbcode-u">client sided error</span> and then you could stop asking people that work with <span class="bbcode-u">servers</span> for help. Yes, it’s java, but a lot of the people in the <span class="bbcode-u">server</span> help section don’t work with clients, making it hard for us to actually help you with that.</p>
<p>An alternative to editing everything client sided, you could always force the text to show 100-120, using the <a href="https://rswiki.moparisthebest.com/index.php?title=317:Set_interface_text" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Set Interface Text</a> packet. This would be very messy and nasty, but is a solution for the time being.</p>
<p>Again, go to the client section for client help, server section for server.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Here, let’s just make this simple, here are some pictures so it’s like preschool again, no need to read:<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/IZ6W72v.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>I’m not getting mad, I get told that a lot, I just try too hard to try and explain myself clearer, when people misunderstand and claim I am wrong. When some people like to pretend they’re right when they’re completely wrong.</p>
<p>First of all, I tried changing the line<br>
skills.put(maxedSkill, getId() == 19709 ? 120 : 99);<br>
to<br>
skills.put(maxedSkill, 120);<br>
and it still doesn’t display as 120/120. Like I said, it has nothing to do with the max level but rather it’s just for the itemdefinition item requirements (that’s where it comes from, ItemDefinition.java).</p>
<p>Secondly, the way I have it works perfectly fine, I don’t know what you’re talking about. You still level up to 120 like Dungeoneering. You go from 99-120, each level in between. Not straight to 120.</p>
<p>I am irritated because your attempts to help have not made sense logically, programming-wise. If you cannot understand the code you’re reading or don’t know about a higher revision server/client, don’t attempt to help, because you’re not doing anything but making it more confusing and making me have to type all this out to try and explain to you how you’re <span class="bbcode-b">wrong. Unless you can find me another location where it actually makes dungeoneering able to have more than level 99 and still able to have XP Remaining until 120 client-sided display-wise.</span></p>
<p>For example, I have already searched my whole workspace for the string “XP remaining” written into the client in the Skills Tab when you hover over a skill, nothing comes up in the server files. But nothing comes up in the client source either, so perhaps it’s stored in the cache… I cannot know. And I do not see anyone that knows either.</p>
<p>Neither of those locations have anything to do with DISPLAYING 120/120 IN THE SKILLS TAB IN YOUR CLIENT. It merely allows your server to level your character to 120 all skills and the other has to do with your item requirements, but in the skills tab, the client is unable to display each skill 120/120, only dungeoneering, because dungoneering has it coded IN THE CLIENT, to display more xp remaining when hovering over the skill, all the way till 120. Like I tried to explain. Maybe repeating myself will make it clearer, although it shouldn’t, if you already read it the first time. But apparently not.</p>
<p>Here’s the rest of that code btw</p>
<p>[code]	public HashMap&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; getWearingSkillRequiriments() {<br>
if (clientScriptData == null)<br>
return null;<br>
if (itemRequiriments == null) {<br>
HashMap&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; skills = new HashMap&lt;Integer, Integer&gt;();<br>
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {<br>
Integer skill = (Integer) clientScriptData.get(749 + (i * 2));<br>
if (skill != null) {<br>
Integer level = (Integer) clientScriptData<br>
.get(750 + (i * 2));<br>
if (level != null)<br>
skills.put(skill, level);<br>
}<br>
}<br>
Integer maxedSkill = (Integer) clientScriptData.get(277);<br>
if (maxedSkill != null)<br>
//				skills.put(maxedSkill, getId() == 19709 ? 120 : 99);<br>
skills.put(maxedSkill, 120);<br>
itemRequiriments = skills;<br>
if (getId() == 7462)<br>
itemRequiriments.put(Skills.DEFENCE, 40);<br>
else if (name.equals(“Dragon defender”)) {<br>
itemRequiriments.put(Skills.ATTACK, 60);<br>
itemRequiriments.put(Skills.DEFENCE, 60);<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<pre><code>	return itemRequiriments;
}[/code]
</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">itemRequiriments = skills;</span> -this is where it’s NOT for your skills tab level, but for your item requirements</p>
<p>In the end, I’m just tired of people that try and help, but act like they know more, insist that they’re right and I’m wrong, but cannot read the code I describe, claims that changing the code I showed would actually fix it when I already tried changing it to simply 120 instead of 99. Insist it’s impossible to be client-sided. That’s what I get irritated by, not that you’re trying to help, I appreciate all help, just don’t treat me like a retard and call what I said retarded, when nothing you’ve said verifies either.</p>
<p>Maybe you haven’t seen a client that limits your max level, but the problem is, it doesn’t limit your max level, the CLIENT CANNOT DISPLAY IT. I in fact remember this happening since 317s.</p>
<p>I remember setting the max skills level 255, and it would display 255/99 just like now (this may be selective memory, it may be that 317-474 clients do do it the way you describe, which allows you 255/255 for example).</p>
<p>In my old 508 server, same thing. So, you must not have much experience with 508+ servers in general, to claim what you’re claiming. Show me one 508+ server where you can successfully set your levels to x/x &gt; 99, like your supposed code of if(xp &gt; integer). I can’t find such a thing, and I’ve never seen that code used in a server before, except those retard servers with one client.java and everything jammed inside it, maybe those (317-474?).</p>
<p>And I’ve also already been told long before, that the only reason people cannot set skills above 99 max, is exactly what I am saying, because it’s client-sided. I’m not just saying this out of my own knowledge, others have said the same thing.</p>
<p>And I love how Pure_ acts like he knows everything, but doesn’t do a thing to actually hint and help me. Probably just jumping on the bandwagon.</p>
<p>Another thing to add, the total level also doesn’t go above the max: when you hit 99 all skills and 120 dung, you’re total 2497 or something. While if you had 120/120 all skills it would be 3000 total exact. It only displays 2497 because the client can only display the values of 99 for each skills except dungeoneering, therefore the total level is also still the original 99 skills besides dung. While with my stats checker in a separate interface, shows that the server actually recognizes my total level is in fact 3000, when 120/99 all skills, because I’m actually 120/120, the client just <span class="bbcode-b">cannot display it</span>.</p>
<p>So let’s get pass this whole idea that it’s a server, unless someone with enough knowledge of 508+ clients can show exactly where in the server files you can do what I’m talking about. Otherwise we should be checking the client… finally.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>[quote=“winK, post:9, topic:541073”]Then where does it get the experience for each level in the tracker in your skills tab? Isn’t that where I need to look? Not the getLevelForXp.</p>
<p>I found this:</p>
<p><code>			Integer maxedSkill = (Integer) clientScriptData.get(277);
			if (maxedSkill != null)
				skills.put(maxedSkill, getId() == 19709 ? 120 : 99);</code></p>
<p>But it’s not it, it has to do with the item requirements.</p>
<p>I cannot think of where to look to allow all skills to <span class="bbcode-i">DISPLAY IN THE SKILLS TAB AS 120/120.<br>
EVEN THOUGH MY MAX LEVEL IS 120 EVERY SKILL, IT SHOWS 120/99 IN THE SKILLS TAB.</span></p>
<p>My server recognizes that my skills are all level 120, and if you gain enough XP in a skill besides dungeoneering, you can still level to 120, but each time it just shows 100…101…102…103…/99, AND you cannot see how much <span class="bbcode-i">XP IS REMAINING TILL NEXT LEVEL, WHILE DUNGEONEERING YOU CAN.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">And I think all of you guys are completely mistaken when I say that it cannot be 120/120, I mean it doesn’t display in the Skills Tab as 120/120. Not that I cannot get my all skills to level up to 120</span>. That specifically is client-sided is what I’m saying. I know I can set the maximum level to be 120, and I already have. Like I showed in my code, that makes all my skills go up to 120.</p>
<p>The problem is: In the SKILLS TAB, it only shows 120/99, because the client doesn’t know how to display any higher values than 99 for all the skills besides dungeoneering, because it has the tracker setup so when you level to max it doesn’t show the next level anymore, well, dungeoneering can go up to 120 before it does that, and every skill 100+ displays the xp remaining before level, but other skills don’t display that. Once it hits 99 then it removes the remaining xp till level…</p>
<p>So, that specifically, the displaying of the client, in the SKILLS TAB, showing your SKILLS LEVELS, only displays x/99 max for all skills except dungeoneering. Is that understandable?[/quote]<br>
Listen.<br>
First off, don’t get <span class="bbcode-u">irritated</span> or <span class="bbcode-u">mad</span> at us for trying to <span class="bbcode-b">help</span>. All of us are helping based off past experience with these servers. I haven’t seen a single client that limited your max level. Why they would is just plain retarded.</p>
<p>Second, why not remove this:</p>
<p><code>
			if (maxedSkill != null)
				skills.put(maxedSkill, getId() == 19709 ? 120 : 99);</code><br>
That’s obviously the code that is preventing your levels to get to above 99.</p>
<p>Third:</p>
<p>[quote=“winK, post:5, topic:541073”]Awesome, been looking for that, makes sense.</p>
<p>Searched for it, came up with nothing… As you can see this is what I’ve done:</p>
<p><code>	public int getLevelForXp(int skill) {
		double exp = xp[skill];

<p>Nowhere does it say the exp &gt; i… doesn’t really make sense either now that I think about it. Why would they set each xp for each level when it’s automatic? The client itself recognizes when there’s how much xp left for every level without having to program it into the server.[/quote]<br>
This part, I don’t understand why you did:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>This doesn’t check if the exp is at the right variable. That way making it possible that someone with more than 13m exp and a prestige level of greater than 6 will automatically have 120.<br>
Remember, the getLevelForXP formula for all levels to 120.</p>

              <p>Then where does it get the experience for each level in the tracker in your skills tab? Isn’t that where I need to look? Not the getLevelForXp.</p>
<p>I found this:</p>
<p><code>			Integer maxedSkill = (Integer) clientScriptData.get(277);
			if (maxedSkill != null)
				skills.put(maxedSkill, getId() == 19709 ? 120 : 99);</code></p>
<p>But it’s not it, it has to do with the item requirements.</p>
<p>I cannot think of where to look to allow all skills to <span class="bbcode-i">DISPLAY IN THE SKILLS TAB AS 120/120.<br>
EVEN THOUGH MY MAX LEVEL IS 120 EVERY SKILL, IT SHOWS 120/99 IN THE SKILLS TAB.</span></p>
<p>My server recognizes that my skills are all level 120, and if you gain enough XP in a skill besides dungeoneering, you can still level to 120, but each time it just shows 100…101…102…103…/99, AND you cannot see how much <span class="bbcode-i">XP IS REMAINING TILL NEXT LEVEL, WHILE DUNGEONEERING YOU CAN.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">And I think all of you guys are completely mistaken when I say that it cannot be 120/120, I mean it doesn’t display in the Skills Tab as 120/120. Not that I cannot get my all skills to level up to 120</span>. That specifically is client-sided is what I’m saying. I know I can set the maximum level to be 120, and I already have. Like I showed in my code, that makes all my skills go up to 120.</p>
<p>The problem is: In the SKILLS TAB, it only shows 120/99, because the client doesn’t know how to display any higher values than 99 for all the skills besides dungeoneering, because it has the tracker setup so when you level to max it doesn’t show the next level anymore, well, dungeoneering can go up to 120 before it does that, and every skill 100+ displays the xp remaining before level, but other skills don’t display that. Once it hits 99 then it removes the remaining xp till level…</p>
<p>So, that specifically, the displaying of the client, in the SKILLS TAB, showing your SKILLS LEVELS, only displays x/99 max for all skills except dungeoneering. Is that understandable?</p>

<p>Like I said, I am right. Unless you can find me another location where it actually states each level for each level after 99 for Dungeoneering. It must be client-sided otherwise.

It’s simple.<br>
You know where it says something like</p>
<p><code>
if(exp &gt; 13034431)
return 99;</code></p>
<p>Change that to</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(exp &gt; 104273166)
return 120;</code></pre>
<p>It’s literally the easiest edit ever.</p>
