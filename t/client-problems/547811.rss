    <title>Client Problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-problems/547811</link>
    <description>Hey I recently started developing a 525 server and after fixing some major bugs I decided to put my first ever server online.
I got the porting working and when I sent the client to my co-owner it worked for him.
But for some reason when I send the client to a few other friends they have a &quot;java exception has occured&quot; message pop up whenever they try to open and they cannot play.

Also my friend who has a mac just has a client with a blank white screen open when he clicks on the client.

Some help would be greatly appreciated, you can pm me on here or reply to the forums if you would be greatful enough to help :)

Thanks in advance.</description>

              <p>So I am 99% sure that the problem is with the client, I have used different codes in the signlink.java to make the client download the cache. If anyone can help me to get this right It would be awesome.</p>
<p>String as[] = {System.getProperty(“user.home”)+System.getProperty(“file.separator”)};<br>
if(storeid &lt; 32 || storeid &gt; 34)<br>
storeid = 32;<br>
String s = “acheron.cache”+System.getProperty(“file.separator”);<br>
for(int i = 0; i &lt; as.length; i++)<br>

String s1 = as[i];<br>

File file = new File(s1);<br>

              <p>For the mac issue… I don’t know exactly. Have your friend go into terminal and run the client using</p>
<p><code>
java -jar filename.jar</code><br>
Errors should report in the terminal and we can go from there.</p>
<p>As for ports, check your IPv4 address. It may have changed. To fix this go into your router (not all allow this) and make your computer have a static IP address. Double check the port forward settings.</p>
<p>Most routers have a DHCP lease time of 1 week by default. So every week your IPv4 address gets reset.<br>
Making it static will prevent it from being reset.</p>

              <p>Thank you for the quick reply, I downloaded JDK 7 and recompiled the client with that and now it works.</p>
<p>Would you have any idea how to fix the mac problem that is still occuring? When I give the client to my friend who is on a mac he opens it and the screen goes white, nothing else happens.</p>
<p>Also, if you know anything about ports, when I updated my server last time my ports decided to close and noone but me could log on again, if you know how to fix this problem for this occasion and possibly other occasions to come that would be awesome.</p>
<p>Sorry for all the problems, just wanting to get server up for friends before digging right into the code! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Thanks again in advance.</p>

              <p>Your friends probably do not have Java 1.8.<br>
Your client is probably compiled on Java 1.8.<br>
This causes a major.minor error  (I think it’s 53.0 actually)</p>
<p>But anyways, solutions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compile and target a lower JDK.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>On compile use the -target parameter.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Compile using a lower JDK version (1.7)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They upgrade to a newer Java (1.8)</p>
</li>
