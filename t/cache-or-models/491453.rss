    <title>Cache or Models?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cache-or-models/491453</link>
    <description>I feel really stupid asking this but I am curious.

Let&#39;s say that I created my own world but would like to either include or edit some of RuneScape&#39;s buildings/castles. Would I just add and form walls into the shape of the building or is there a specific way to edit Runescape&#39;s Building models.</description>

              <p>Actually, runescape’s buildings are completely built object by object. Its not like WoW where all buildings are a model. The only way to form a building is to find flatland (or make it with a map editor) and start adding the walls, windowed walls, etc. If you do that on land that isnt flat you’ll quickly learn why I recommended flatland.</p>
