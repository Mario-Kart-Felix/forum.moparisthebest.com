    <title>How to make the webclient run off the server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-the-webclient-run-off-the-server/334783</link>
    <description>I am wondering how to make the webclient run off of the server. I don&#39;t know how to use fileden. If someone is on the website with the webclient do they have to be running the server? and if i make a downloadable client, when they want to play do they have to have the client and server going at the same time? I also wondering where i put the .jar file for the webclient. And what files do i compact into the .jar file? do i do both the client and server? or just the client? or just the server?</description>
