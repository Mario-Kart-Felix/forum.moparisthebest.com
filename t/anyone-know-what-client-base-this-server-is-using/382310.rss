    <description>Yo whats good. Alright so basically i downloaded this source called relentless scape [PI] [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=477669.0]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=477669.0[/url] and the client has antileech. it is pi but what i was wonderin is what is the client base, like where could i get a clean version of the client. why im asking this is cuz he released his client with tonnes of antileech and he says to use any other PI client but the other ones dont work. so i wanna use a clean base of this client and add all the models. (trust me i am very experience in clients and webclients so all i need is someone to tell me what client this server used)</description>
