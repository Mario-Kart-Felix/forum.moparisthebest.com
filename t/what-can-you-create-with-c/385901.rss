    <title>What can you create with C++?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-can-you-create-with-c/385901</link>
    <description>So far, all Ive seen is games and calculators made with C++
I&#39;m new to Java, or programming in general, and I know hardly anything about it. Before I start trying to learn it, I want to know what I can do with it.
And if I learn programming, I want to do more than just games.
One thing I find really interesting is anti virus software, or how an OS is developed.
Maybe I&#39;m dumb, but I&#39;ve never heard of an AV made from Java.
What is it made from?
Or something like Team Viewer or Internet Explorer.
What language are those coded in and how much knowledge is needed to code something like that?
Sorry for my stupidity.
And btw, I&#39;m not trolling in case you&#39;re wodnering  ;)</description>

              <p>If you want to make a browser, you need much knowledge about implementation of HTML, CSS and JS including experience in your language. So if you want to program on a hobby basis don’t try for the things even big companies fails at (MS with IE, non anti-virus program is 100% perfect, team-viewer need efficient network use)</p>
<p>So what to program?<br>
Creative programs that fulfill peoples need in a better/nicer way.</p>
