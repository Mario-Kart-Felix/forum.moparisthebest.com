<p>Awwwwwwwww, Not cool, Anywaysss, How much do these C++ classes cost ?[/quote]Depends on how many credits.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 11, 2008, 11:48:15 am[/size][hr]I felt it unnecessary to make another thread about me bitching about this class, but an update!:<br>

<a href="http://www.alice.org/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.alice.org/</a></p>
<p>He’s actually going through with it as if it’s programming…  This guy, seriously, a fucking idiot.  I want to call him out on it.  I wonder if he’s actually programmed anything at all.</p>

<p>i rebel against my history teachers, telling them that teaching me the same damn thing for the last 11 years of my life isn’t helping me. my teacher tried to “calm the class down, because i sent them into a WILD RAGE”. i’m pretty sure he’s referring to the people talking to each other, like every class, because he’s a dumb shit that doesn’t know how to tell the class to shut the fuck up.</p>

My teacher wanted me to copy some text for some reason, so I highlighted it, hit Ctrl + C and he shouted out me because he didn’t know what I did. Then he made me get out of my seat and sat down himself to click Edit then Copy…<br>

i actually so hate that when teachers do that, you don’t do it their way which is longer and you get told off[/quote]<br>
Thats what I’m hoping will be different in college. Gone through all my school life being told off by teachers for using a shorter method. Then I bring them up on this and they say something like</p>
<p>“In order to do the short method you must know the long method”</p>
<p>then I’m like: I ALREADY UNDERSTAND THE LONG METHOD WHY DO YOU THINK I KNOW THE SHORT METHOD.</p>
<p>Maths sucked ass. Illogical teacher.  Got chucked out of that for telling her that her logic floated away out of the window, she got angry at this so I stood on a chair by a window and showed her with hand actions how they go floating out of the window.</p>
