    <title>OK, storytime :)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ok-storytime/339742</link>
    <description>
OK, today, at school, I got pulled out of lesson 3 to go to the headteacher.  I sat there wondering what I&#39;d done, nervous as fuck, finally after about 20 minutes, I was called in, as she was on the phone previously, I sat down and waited for her to say something.
She brought up an email from the school I.T technicians on her computer, turned round and looked at me and started explaining.  She said I had been using unlicensed adobe products on the school system, and I could be facing fines of up to £500,000, if the police were contacted.


All it was, was a portable version of Photoshop CS4, which I was using for design work for my website and the I.C.T Portfolio and full course project.  Currently, I&#39;m scared shitless, lets just say I have a lot of stuff on my laptop. ;)  And I would much prefer that it was not found.
And the ironic thing is, I was actually using the trial version, yes, I downloaded it illegally, but I never actually used the crack on it.  However, there was a text file within the folder titled &#39;serial&#39;, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;d be a good idea to explain to them it was just a trial downloaded from the Adobe website.


I am now banned altogether from using the school computers for the rest of this year, which is the rest of my secondary school life.


£500,000, do you think she was being serious?
How likely is it that I&#39;m well, fucked?</description>

              <p>Yes, she was being serious. I torrented some 60$ tutorial from a site i do not want to say, and inside was an FBI backup for a fine of $250,000 for copying or redistributing.</p>
<p>IMO they won’t fine a kid in court. If you’re trying to learn something on the computer and it requires you to purchase a $1000+ program most likely your parents will lol and say go outside. If you explain you weren’t selling any of your creations and it was strictly for learning yourself you’d probably get some kinda penalty or community service and not a fine. And if you endup going to court explain that you wouldn’t do such a thing in the professional world and you would buy it when you had your own money to do so.</p>
<p>PS: my school memory stick has $4000 worth of stuff on it.</p>

That is pretty awesome, turning arguments in your favor is the greatest. To be able to delete the serial file…</p>
<p>~<s>Steps</s>~<br>
1.) Contact a good friend of yours<br>
2.) Record step-by-step instructions to delete the ‘serial’ file<br>
3.) Make mp3<br>
4.) Give said mp3 file to the good friend from step 1 and have him ‘listen to music’ while doing ‘schoolwork’</p>
<p>That should work…but i dont know how your school works, so it probably wont work at all  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
