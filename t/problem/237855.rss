    <description>Hi there, i have recently tried to add bowstring on (u) bows and I had a problem with my fletching, i am using runefusion and i added the correct things into in &#39;Item-On-Item.Config.&#39; Don&#39;t say i might of entered it correctly because it is in correct, everything that was added when you download runefusion in there wasnt working too.

also item requirements are not working either.

Any ideas how i could fix this??

Thanks

p.s if you don&#39;t know about runefusion then maybe you could post it about wL becuz runefusion was made from wL</description>
