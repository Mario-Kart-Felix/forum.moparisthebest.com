    <description>I need help with fixing my No-Ip thing, finally with the help of I Am Noob, I got some of it to work.

My port is 43594 and my ip is correct (when I type it in). It works for me, but when other people try it, it doesn&#39;t work. Anyone know why? My firewalls are all down too.

  I don&#39;t know but this might explain something to some of you.

I used Ultimate Pk scape as my source to build the server, and it ran on a 5555 port, so I had to chage it to 43594 by going into server.java do any of you all know if thats all I have to really do? 

I used DnsDyn or something like that to create my domain, and then I logged into that at my routers setting.

**If you want me to post pictures of any of my settings just ask, Ill post em**

Help please! (If you play real RuneScape, I only have like 500k on my account and its almost out of member ship, but Ill give you 500k if you can help my fix my problem, I also have MSN and AIM. ) [br][size=1]Posted on: March 03, 2007, 03:13:06 PM[/size][hr]Add me: vraj821@hotmail.com

= Also, person that does help me gets adminship in my server. Along with the payment for helping me =</description>

<p>So there is a port 5555 and 43594 open.</p>
<p>Also compile the server before you run it.</p>
