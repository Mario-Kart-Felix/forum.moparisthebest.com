              <p>It still doesnt work, i have a buddy of mine who is at my house connecting to my internet and he even isnt getting on. and he is connected to my hamachi too. Then someone told me you have to static ip in order to portforward linksys routers, but then again i dont know what ip to use since there is 3 computers running on the same internet.</p>

              <p>If you have Hamachi, you don’t have to port forward. All you do is click on the little triangle in the bottom right hand corner of your hamachi, then click on Create a New Network. Put your desired network name in the Network Name box, and a password in the Password box. Make sure your password for hamachi is easy, or else no one will be able to get on. Most people set their password as 123, so I suggest that. Now for someone to get on your server, they have to join your Hamachi network, then type your Hamachi IP, found at the top of your Hamachi in big white numbers, into the Server IP, and log on. Hope this helps.</p>
