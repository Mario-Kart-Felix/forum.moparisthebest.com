    <title>Space based MMORTS using c++ (need graphics engine)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/space-based-mmorts-using-c-need-graphics-engine/366081</link>
    <description>Ok, well he have slightly changed our design plan. the game is going to be a rps (role playing stratergy) as we figured it would be too hard to implement fps into it, anyway, here is the basic idea.


&lt;blockquote&gt;[size=24pt]General ideas:[/size]
The game will be a space based MMORPS, implemented in a large universe with many missions and goals to complete, the game will be written in C++.
It will be based around a medium sized galaxy called [insert name here].
The galaxy and solar systems will be grid based, so it will reduce server load (only loads the grid spaces that the players are curriently standing on) and greatly reduce the need for fast connections (as the world space will be smaller, and sometimes there may not be another player in that area)
Inside this galaxy there will be 2 solar systems containing 2 different races, each with different architecture and looks, you will always have the option of attacking the other race, except in their home solar system.
There will be many more solar systems in the galaxy, with the easy option of warping to solar systems within X grid spaces of you (the higher your rank, the more grid spaces you can jump?).
Since the universe is grid based you can leave blank spaces for future addons, even whole new galaxys!&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;[size=24pt]Ranking system:[/size]
Ranks are the form of leveling in this game, you have 12 ranks, each with 3 tiers, totaling 48, they will go somewhat like this:
A midshipman starts out, getting a few kills, then once his commendation bar is full, he gets ranked up to midshipman grade 1, and so on until he reached the end of midshipman grade 3, then the player gets ranked up to ensign, and so on.
We will be using the New Zealand navy military ranking system because it will be easy to implement into the game.
The game will also include an advanced prestige system as explained below:
Once you reach the highest rank, you will get the option of going prestige, which basically allows the player to create a new account under their old username. if you chose the option to go prestige you will get the character creation screen, but with a few more advanced options that will not be avalible to newcomers.
The options that will be given will allow the player to transfer a certan amount of ships and money and items to the new account, somewhat like world of warcraft. you will not be limited to 1 prestige, but you can rank up your prestige to grade 1-100, by getting the rank of admiral of fleet again, and going through the same process.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


i have now talked with one of my friends (the networking guru)  for 4 hours and we have decided that he will build the client/server framework, and that we will be using openGL for our rendering, also we will be using a open scource game engine, which will cut down programming time.
atm we are looking at: [url=http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/index.html]http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/index.html[/url] for the engine, but we are open to new suggestions.

<p>im not the programmer, im just trying to help my mates by getting somthing that will remove the need to code (or start from scratch) the client/server framework, as that is a big part that can be shortened by a few weeks to 1 minute of download time <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
i mean, all 4 of us are qavid players of multible mmo’s and we all have allways dreamed of making a mmo, but i have never had the coding skill, which has limited me alot <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
and lol, one other thing, a few years back, one of my mates (who is helping with this project) decided to make a text based mmo in VB (yes VB) and it worked amaisgnly well, but there was only 1 problem it has, and that was when a player steped ontop of another player…<br>
the whole game would freeze and the person on the bottom would be kicked from the game.</p>

              <p>yeah, we have looked at udk, and i find it quite cool, i mean, i personally couldent do shit with it except import some of my models and muck around with em, but yeah, i guess i could have a look at that, but now that i think about its networking capabilitys, i dont think it would be able to handle a client/server setup…</p>
<p>[edit]<br>
i am thinking that we might actually be able to use udk, and build some sort of server for it to connect to, as the server dosent really have to be the same language as the client, they just have to understand the i/o data (i think thats right?)<br>
and udk has its own scripting language, so i think we could utalise that into doing some client stuff <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

[/quote]<br>
I lol’d, then stopped reading.[/quote]</p>
<p>Mhmm, ok?<br>
heres the plan (its kind of hard to explain without a working example, and none of this is finalised)<br>
You are a commander of a small fleet of trade craft, and member of one of 2-4 factions,<br>
the fps- rts part will come into play in the skirmishes in space, which go somthing like this:<br>
Theres a battle happening between you and another player, or AI, and  you are in the rts mode, when one of your ships comes under serious fire, you seclect the ship and press “tab” and you go into 1st person mode, and fight against some of the ships.<br>
once you blow up a few ships, getting hurt in the process, so you press tab again and then seclect a landing craft, which is loaded with troops, and go into 1st person mode, bringing the craft into the enemy hanger…<br>
after unloading your troops, you can assign them tasks, or go into 1st person mode with one, and complete the task 1st hand, meenwhile a few of your mates join this battle and start skirmishing with the enemy.<br>
since your troops are in the enemy mothership, you run round and blow up the generator, and get out, you have won the battle.</p>
<p>thats generally the idea, and some of my freinds that i have talked to about the rts part said it would be too over powered, so im thinking that all damage from ai craft will be reduced by 15-30%.</p>
<p>Yeah, thats the general idea…</p>

              <p>Ok, well he have slightly changed our design plan. the game is going to be a rps (role playing stratergy) as we figured it would be too hard to implement fps into it, anyway, here is the basic idea.</p>
<blockquote>[size=24pt]General ideas:[/size]
The game will be a space based MMORPS, implemented in a large universe with many missions and goals to complete, the game will be written in C++.
It will be based around a medium sized galaxy called [insert name here].
The galaxy and solar systems will be grid based, so it will reduce server load (only loads the grid spaces that the players are curriently standing on) and greatly reduce the need for fast connections (as the world space will be smaller, and sometimes there may not be another player in that area)
Inside this galaxy there will be 2 solar systems containing 2 different races, each with different architecture and looks, you will always have the option of attacking the other race, except in their home solar system.
There will be many more solar systems in the galaxy, with the easy option of warping to solar systems within X grid spaces of you (the higher your rank, the more grid spaces you can jump?).
Since the universe is grid based you can leave blank spaces for future addons, even whole new galaxys!</blockquote>
<blockquote>[size=24pt]Ranking system:[/size]
Ranks are the form of leveling in this game, you have 12 ranks, each with 3 tiers, totaling 48, they will go somewhat like this:
A midshipman starts out, getting a few kills, then once his commendation bar is full, he gets ranked up to midshipman grade 1, and so on until he reached the end of midshipman grade 3, then the player gets ranked up to ensign, and so on.
We will be using the New Zealand navy military ranking system because it will be easy to implement into the game.
The game will also include an advanced prestige system as explained below:
Once you reach the highest rank, you will get the option of going prestige, which basically allows the player to create a new account under their old username. if you chose the option to go prestige you will get the character creation screen, but with a few more advanced options that will not be avalible to newcomers.
The options that will be given will allow the player to transfer a certan amount of ships and money and items to the new account, somewhat like world of warcraft. you will not be limited to 1 prestige, but you can rank up your prestige to grade 1-100, by getting the rank of admiral of fleet again, and going through the same process.</blockquote>
<p>i have now talked with one of my friends (the networking guru)  for 4 hours and we have decided that he will build the client/server framework, and that we will be using openGL for our rendering, also we will be using a open scource game engine, which will cut down programming time.<br>
atm we are looking at: <a href="http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/index.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/index.html</a> for the engine, but we are open to new suggestions.</p>
