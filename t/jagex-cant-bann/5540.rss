    <title>Jagex can&#39;t bann?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jagex-cant-bann/5540</link>
    <description>Well, I just ran a test on Jagex, and by the results it seems Mods can&#39;t bann people for things they do outside of runscape. I made a video of my noob account saying he was selling an auto-fighter. Then I posted it on youtube and on my main reported my noob to jagex... Here&#39;s what they said:

&quot;Dear ********,

Thank you for contacting RuneScape Customer Support about this player.

We will look into this situation as soon as possible and take any action that we can, however without an &#39;Abuse Report&#39; we are limited on what we can do about such a matter.

If this ever happens to you again or you witness it happening to someone else we would ask you to hit the &#39;Report Abuse&#39; button at the bottom of your game screen and then follow the on-screen instructions. As soon as we have the report with us we will be able to take the appropriate action.

Please keep an eye out for such players so that we can remove them from the game.

Thanks again for helping make RuneScape a safer place.

Yours Sincerely
Mod Ket&quot;

Unless I&#39;m reading this wrong she&#39;s saying she can&#39;t bann him because I didn&#39;t use &quot;Report Abuse&quot; in game, though she has clear video of him doing it.

What do you think?</description>
