    <title>Bittorrent to Email</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bittorrent-to-email/333120</link>
    <description>So I have a connection that peers with google. Which means that traffic to google is unmetered.

I&#39;m thinking of getting a VPS that runs bittorrent. Splits the file into parts, encrypt them and then emails them to gmail. I then retrieve. Alternatively just upload and download with GmailFS.

So any advice on this kind of setup? What hosting is the cheapest but would let me get away with the high-bandwidth / CPU usage? Is Gmail going to rage at me?</description>

<p>If you remember the old server that <a href="http://mitb.moparisthebest.com">mitb.moparisthebest.com</a> used to be hosted on, which earlier used to host the forums that I rented from kib (veritynet).  I used to run torrentflux on that and downloaded literally terabytes of data with it and he never noticed/cared.  It was a dedicated server though.</p>

<p>I read about that awhile ago. I don’t think any “let” you torrent. But you just do it, if they catch you then your service gets cancelled and no refund. Otherwise you will be fine. I don’t see why you want to go this route though unless you are as paranoid about bittorrent as I am.</p>
<p>Also, you could just write modify a open source bittorrent client, make it look like something its not, download the files with a weird extension that really isnt the write extension. Then encrypt them, then send them out. I really don’t see how they could find out this way. Really what im trying to say is make a program that runs that they can’t find and make sure they can’t read the files.</p>
