    <title>Who is Luke?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/who-is-luke/433922</link>
    <description>And why does he insist on attacking servers, yet provide no reason why?

When I ask him why, I get the normal nerdy response of &quot;umad?&quot; or &quot; stfu kid&quot;.</description>

<p>I don’t though. I don’t know who you are, I don’t know what server you’re talking about, I couldn’t even tell you what other servers are active right now without looking through the advertisement section.</p>
<p>You however know me, know my real name, know what server I run, know about the community, know about subscribing and only subscribers being able to post, know about my hosting package and DDoS protection and so on. There’s a huge difference. We both know you know far more than that as well but I can only list what you’ve admitted to knowing in this very thread.</p>

<p>If you ask anyone in this scene who ‘Luke’ is 99% of them will claim it’s me. I’m not being big headed, that’s just how it is… If someone is using the name ‘Luke’ they are more than likely impersonating me (especially if they’re being malicious towards another server).</p>

<p>Lots of new servers are hosted by Staminus and still fail. I could name at least 5 off the top of my head. RSCEmulation started off hosted on a PC, we could only afford a dedicated server after it started to gain interest and we could introduce the subscription system. If a server fails it’s easier to blame DDoS and funding than admit they didn’t have the knowledge, experience and patience to keep it online.</p>
