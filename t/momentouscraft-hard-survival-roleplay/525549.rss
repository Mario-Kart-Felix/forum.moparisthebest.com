MomentousCraft is a Hard-Survival + Roleplay Server.
What do we mean with Hard Survival?
Yes it’s like normal Survival, but you need to follow the rules and never abuse anything and the Difficulty in the server Is on Hard.
What do we mean with Roleplay?
Well, Roleplay means that we need to act like Real Life, well like the old times. The rules will tell you a little more about it.
Here is a few rules you need to know before you join:

Rule #1: Do not spam.
Rule #2: You&#39;re not allowed to spam grief, What do i mean by spam grief? Well, you&#39;re not allowed to grief the whole location, again and again and again.

Rule #3: You&#39;re only allowed to PvP (kill) when you raid a location / steal items from a location. Or you can start a In-Game fight, But not a random one.
Rule #3,5: You’re not allowed to random kill someone, you need to have a valid reason to kill someone.

Rule #4: No hacking, no xraying etc.
Rule #5: Do not, also NEVER advertise other servers &amp; games.
Rule #6: No Racism.
Rule #7: Can&#39;t kill yourself to get your hunger bar back.
