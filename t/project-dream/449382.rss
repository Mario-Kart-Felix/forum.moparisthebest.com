              <p>they are called Graphic design, not banners 0.0 haven’t heard a logo called a banner for some time. Well can you give me any server information? anything to show that it isn’t being leeched, and I know the source of team torva due to me looking it through so I will know if it is being leeched. What have you added? What are you going to add? Pictures also would seal the deal.</p>
