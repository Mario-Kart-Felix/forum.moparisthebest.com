    <title>Help me with my Code please :) [delta 317] - still no help :\</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-me-with-my-code-please-delta-317-still-no-help/405633</link>
    <description>Okay Well i&#39;m running delta and i&#39;m trying to make a suggestion code.
I want it to be when a player named &quot;john&quot; says something like: &quot;::suggest add an alter at home&quot;
I want it to put that in a text doc. named &quot;suggestions&quot; in my config folder as: &quot;John - add an alter at home&quot;
I&#39;ve started the code but i really have no idea how to make it say what the person said.
Here is what i have so far, any help will be appreciated!

[code]if (command.startsWith(&quot;suggest&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 0) {
writeLog(p.playerName, &quot;Suggestions&quot;);
}[/code]

Thanks in Advance, Steve.</description>
