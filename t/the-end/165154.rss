    <description>Face it. Hate began before time, before light, before the moon blessed us with its love and care, before the sun caressed us with its warm hands. We&#39;ll never stop it. Here and everywhere, your hate and mine hurts us all and propagates itself in our children. We could stop it. We could stop everything. But no. We hate others for hating. We hate ourselves for hating others. So open your window and bask in the light. Whether you see the sun or the moon right now doesn&#39;t matter. North or south, east or west, Christian or Muslim, we&#39;re all the same essentially. We all need and want. Love yourself and love your fellows. Fuck the celebration of differences; difference breeds discriminatory conduct. You preach peace and act violently. Good job. I won because I lost, and that kindled someone&#39;s fire. So accept your loss and thus win, so someone else might have their fire burn again. Lost and delirious, they wander in silence. They don&#39;t speak because they don&#39;t know. Run through the grass and love the feeling of cold and warm and everything you feel. It is good because it is bad. There is nothing but yourself and your light. Feed that light and keep it burning. Live forever because you desire death. Die now because you cling to life. Walk free in the planar sphere.</description>

I have very little experience, actually none, with getting off drugs, but you should try drinking lots of fluids [preferably water] and lying down, it might help a little.</p>

<p>I. Fucking. Concur.<br>
It’s amazing that this forum has come to stupid shit like this and spam everywhere else.<br>
I don’t see this as an intelligent conversation at all.<br>
I almost feel like my IQ has dropped from reading these crazy arguements.<br>
And it’s not that I’m not intelligent enough to understand it. I’ve done drugs, and I’m actually really smart.</p>
<p>This is still rediculous.</p>
