    <description>[url=https://github.com/lare96/asteria_317/]Asteria #317 Open Source Emulator [git][/url]

[b][u][url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,657253.0.html]This has been released.[/url][/u][/b]




[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b]

Asteria is an [b]open source[/b] #317 emulator based off of Runesource by blakeman8192. Lot of new design techniques I had been thinking of for awhile were put into this, and I never thought I would be able to pull it off. I&#39;m really amped for this because I feel as if it is some of the best code I&#39;ve ever written. Although this is open source an official release in the downloads section will be made when I have finished adding content. Feel free to check out my current progress right now and suggest improvements, or even download it and work on it (if you&#39;re up to it!).

<p>not a lot is missing, I’ve started on combat, left tons of documentation, and even have a folder with unimplemented code that might be useful to the developer.</p>

              <p>thank you guys! more updates. updated the git too.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Logging in/out stack error fixed</span><br>
Holy crap. This would have been the bug to end it all. I was considering dropping Asteria because of how simple this was to fix. What was happening was, when the player experienced a packet/buffer issue, it would call the <span class="bbcode-i">disconnect()</span> method which would call the <span class="bbcode-i">logout()</span> method, which would call the logout packet! and what happened? everything just repeated itself: <span class="bbcode-i">disconnect()</span> -&gt; <span class="bbcode-i">logout()</span> -&gt; <span class="bbcode-i">logout packet</span> -&gt; <span class="bbcode-i">disconnect()</span> -&gt; <span class="bbcode-i">logout() </span>-&gt; <span class="bbcode-i">logout packet</span> … and so on, until a <span class="bbcode-i">StackOverflowErro</span>r was thrown. For some reason this caused everyone online to disconnect and the server to completely go into an “lost” state and stop accepting any connections! I fixed this by making sure that if a player is disconnected from a packet/buffer issue, that no more packets are sent to the player and they just disconnect without the logout packet, but instead with the packet/buffer issue!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Objects and Entity height level bug fixed</span><br>
There was a bug where mobs and objects would spawn on every height level. The reason for mobs doing this was because a small part in mob updating was done wrong (thanks blake lol -.-) and the objects was my fault because I wasn’t checking for the correct height level when the region updated.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">GUI finally finished</span><br>
Just when you thought I was done with it… <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I showed it to one of my friends on skype and he told me it made him a bit bummy that there wasn’t a tab for player actions. I had considered adding that originally but scrapped the idea because I find them useless. But… My friend convinced me enough and I did it, so here it is. You also have the option to save your current settings for the next time you start up (including what’s written on the notepad). If for some your saved setting get deleted, a new settings file with the default properities gets created so you don’t have to worry about anything. Also, this won’t cause much delay in time because I use a scanner (exetremely fast) to parse the data. This is the final build of the gui, anything from here on in with this will be bug fixes.</p>
<p><img src="http://i891.photobucket.com/albums/ac113/zezimo52/gui_zps40511f9a.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">DynamicScheduledWorker bug fixed</span><br>
Yesterday I mentioned two unfixed bugs, this is one of them. The problem was that the task was running 1 tick ahead (so the task was running too fast), and also if you had the task set to execute first before scheduling instead of executing the task first it would just make the task run even FASTER then it was supossed to be running. This has been resolved.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Cutscene started</span><br>
I have completed about 25% of the cutscene so far, and everything is looking great. The only thing I’m worried about is the camera packets, but I’ll deal with that when the time comes.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Thieving completed</span><br>
Added my own little touches to it (as usual), but it’s looking pretty nice I’d say.</p>

<p>is ur task factory better than ticks and cycle events like on 2006scape?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I find my task system in its entirety (the <span class="bbcode-i">server.factory</span> package including the subpackages) to be a lot more useful than “cycle events”.</p>
<p>why?</p>
<p>“task factory”</p>
<p>[ul][li]Support for dynamic cycle based tasks (DynamicScheduledWorker)[/li]<br>
[li]Support for basic tasks that can take on any delay (ScheduledWorker)[/li]<br>
[li]Support for action listening (ScheduledListener)[/li]<br>
[li]Support for mass task scheduling (ScheduledChainFactory)[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>“cycle events”</p>
<p>[ul][li]Support for dynamic cycle based tasks (CycleEvent)[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>But using my task system over cycle events isn’t going to improve your server’s performance by much (or even at all). It just makes writing future code shorter, easier, and faster.</p>
<p>And the problem with this is that if someone who is just starting out uses my task system they won’t know what to do with it or how to utilize it properly… which renders it useless. Cycle events are (seemingly) made to be a form of simple cycle-based task execution, and that’s exactly what it does… executes simple dynamic cycle-based tasks.</p>
<p>tl;dr yes the task factory is better than cycle events, but probably not for the reasons you think.</p>
<p>on topic: will post some more updates for you guys after this gets bumped, release date is getting closer! There’s a small bug with the <span class="bbcode-i">DynamicScheduledWorker</span> that I completely overlooked when making it. There was also a stack issue when logging in (and logging out) that sometimes (30% of logins/logouts) would completely corrupt the character file, log the player out (if they were logged in), and would stop the server from accepting future connections! But these have both been fixed along with tons more bugs and new stuff! I’ll elaborate more when I post the updates, and I’ll also be updating the git. This is another huge and very important update!!!</p>
<p>EDIT: I’m sorry I can’t keep this “lightweight”, but if you guys want goodies like pathfinding you’ll have to bare with this being heavier than the normal Runesource. I’m slowly realizing that “lightweight” servers are really hard to build new content for (as was the original runesource) because they have no foundation. Would you wanna live in a flimsy building with no foundation or support?</p>

<p>Also, small other things that aren’t of much relevance. Some future updates to look forward to are thieving, the cut scene, the custom map region packet (generating maps, used for things like construction and dungeoneering. A lot of people don’t have it so I’m hoping with my release more people will use it), and more updates to the gui (a new tab that lets you manage online players).</p>

              <p>This large update doesn’t really contain much new content. That wasn’t really the focus when I was programming for the last two weeks. What I did do was go through the entire server and re-write old code I thought could be better, and fixed a crapload of bugs! Now with that out of the way all the focus is on the content from now on.</p>
<p>Keeping this “lightweight” is becoming increasingly difficult. In order to do thing as efficiently as possible, I’m trying to make sure everything I do has some sort of ‘foundation’ for future implementation this, along with the need for lots of external loading, is making the server a lot more bulky then I’d hoped.</p>
<p>With that said, the updates:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Issues with global items fixed</span><br>
Found a bug where if you went into a different region then came back, global items would be gone. This issue is resolved.</p>
<p>Another bug where if you picked up a global item, logged out and logged back in the global item would re-appear (but you wouldn’t be able to pick it up, due to the fact that the system wasn’t programmed retardedly). This has been fixed.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Shops</span><br>
Value checking, buying, selling, and even restocking are all fully functional as far as I know. The ability to have shops restock themselves is optional (as if certain shops restocked it could interfere with the economy).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">ScheduledChainFactory</span><br>
The first build of this was a mistake. Pretty much all I was doing was throwing tasks in a queue, and then polling the queue which is pretty useless (and somewhat defies the defintion of a ‘chain’ and ‘controlled execution’, what this was intended to be) and might as well have been scheduling a shit load of tasks instead because it proved to be almost useless when starting the cutscene I intended to do.</p>
<p>So, I’ve solved this issue how? by creating something more flexible, less stressful on the server, and that fits the definition of a ‘chain’ more.</p>
<p>And how does this new creation differ from the old one? Instead of using a shitload of tasks I first created a container Object called a ‘ScheduledChainElement’ that actions are wrapped in along with the delay before being submitted to the factory’s internal queue. Then when the factory is ran one task is scheduled that executes a action only after the last action was completed and the delay is finished (delay time depends on the time unit the chain factory is running on). This results in having execution like so:</p>
<p>new-chain-factory:<br>
chain-element 1 [delay: 3; action: print “hi”];<br>
chain-element 2 [delay: 3; action: print “hi”];<br>
chain-element 3 [delay: 3; action: print “hi”];</p>
<p>… wait 3 seconds print “hi”<br>
… wait 3 more seconds print “hi”<br>
…wait a final three seconds, print “hi” then shutdown the chain factory</p>
<p>rather than</p>
<p>old-chain-factory:<br>
chain-element 1 [delay: 3; action: print “hi”];<br>
chain-element 2 [delay: 3; action: print “hi”];<br>
chain-element 3 [delay: 3; action: print “hi”];</p>
<p>… wait 3 seconds and “hi” is printed three times because the old chain factory was just mass scheduling tasks, which in fact, is putting more stress on the task factory because the new method only uses one task to schedule a mass amount of actions.</p>
<p>Also with the new chain factories, they can be used more than once.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">DedicatedServer concept borked</span></p>
<p>The whole concept was borked, all I was doing was creating a useless thread for no reason other than to hog resources? no more ‘DedicatedServer’.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Item bonuses</span><br>
Correct item bonuses are now dsplayed in the equipment tab.</p>
<p><img src="http://i891.photobucket.com/albums/ac113/zezimo52/itembouns_zps171068b8.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Full helm and platebodies updating</span><br>
Full helmets and platebodies would make the character invisible, I’ve fixed this.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Object Orientation</span><br>
Correct object facing ids, they were messed up before.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Npc Dialogues</span><br>
Was doing npc dialogues statically instead of instancing certain parts per player, which resulted in a weird global effect (if one player was on a certain stage of dialogue with an npc, so was everyone else). This has been fixed.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Walking queue listener fix</span><br>
I noticed a small loophole where the listeners task was occasionally not being stopped and could have caused a huge memory leak if not fixed!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Walking queue addition</span><br>
The ability to lock and unlock your movement has been added.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Updates to the gui</span><br>
Switching between different tabs, a new menu, and a new button. This will be updated even more in the future.</p>

<img src="http://i891.photobucket.com/albums/ac113/zezimo52/3_zpsba4f9f72.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Also crapload of cleaning, renaming, repackaging and other minor bug fixes and additions.</p>
<p>So much has been done that I’d like to call this Asteria v2.0! This is getting close to completetion! Didn’t think I’d get this far!</p>
<p>The git has been updated and I’m hoping to get future updates out more frequently now <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
