    <title>Making the status page vote feature more &#39;reward-friendly&#39;?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-the-status-page-vote-feature-more-reward-friendly/367024</link>
    <description>I had an idea. There are a bunch of people that have links to their servers voting page on this server status page, where in return the voter gets items on the server, or some sort of thing on the forum. The idea is to add an extension to the voting page where someone can have the option link from their website like this:
http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php?action=up&amp;server=blahblahblah[b]&amp;returnto=voteconfirmpage.php[/b]

And then in a servers page control panel (&#39;edit server&#39; or whatever) it has a password key that it sends to that confirm page, which then adds the vote to a mysql database.

It&#39;s hard to explain in words, but if it would ever be taken into consideration I&#39;d be happy to write a rc version</description>

<p>How does typing ::vote or clicking a link force a user to actually vote for the server?  It can’t.[/quote]It doesn’t, and I didn’t say it did. I said the opposite, because people are ‘working around’ the fact that they can abuse those methods and ruin hosted RSPS’s economies. The number of people capable of fixing it (with MySQL or whatever) is very small, but if you prefer I could release a tutorial on how to limit rewards to once per hour (or whatever the vote time limit is) I just thought a return-to feature would be a good thing to have.</p>

<p>It doesn’t need to be for rewards. It could easily be something like ‘If you like this server, click here to vote for us’, without any reward given. The main thing I’m trying to do is make it easier and more functional for people to vote, and easier for server owners to manage it.</p>

<p>I think that any feature you add to the site helps with traffic. RuneScape adds new things to it’s servers so that people will keep playing. Features make more people want to use it, which brings more traffic.</p>

The way to do it would be to leave the links as-is but to, as you say, have an option for a callback page the server owners could implement, so if voted for they would be automatically notified as to the IP that voted for them if the referrer came from their website, or similar.</p>
