    <title>Is Mopar supposed to crash this often?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-mopar-supposed-to-crash-this-often/97158</link>
    <description>I can only really use the HybridScape server on my computer, due to, what I blame it on, me not having Hamachi. Last time I messed around with Hamachi we had to reformat my machine... I&#39;m not doin&#39; that again...

Anyways. Mopar will freeze very often. Then when I try to log back in, it says the account is already logged. I click &quot;Login&quot; a few more times, and then it gives me a different error message saying that the server must be down, and to click &quot;Cancel&#39; and to make my own server.

I exit out of Mopar, and reload it. It&#39;ll let me start my own server again, but it seems that if I play on one account for too long a time, Mopar will freeze right again.

This is very frustrating, and I was hoping someone here could help me.

Oh, here&#39;s my Java file names:

jdk1.6.0_01

jre1.6.0_01

jre1.5.0_06

Not sure if you need those, I just figured I&#39;d post em so you can decide that it is/rule out a Java problem.</description>

              <p>In the Frequently Asked Questions sticky at the top it says that MoparScape WILL crash often because it was built up from scratch. There WILL be errors and glitches. MoparScape crashing is 100% normal. If it happens and you can’t log back in, restart the client. Hope that helps <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
