All of it is c+p’d from firescape, so shut the fuck up. You can’t even fucking change the client’s name without getting compile errors because you know fuck all about java itsself. By the way you stupid fucktard, its spelt “wait” not “waite”. Oh yeah, and as you can see as I posted earlier, the admins abuse like crazy and you don’t do fuck all. Btw my ip is 99.238.105.235. I don’t see how you could hack me when you can’t even code 1 java thing and call yourself the “xml edit pro”. You fail at life if you think your “cool” because you can hire a coder that knows fuck all about java, just as you do. Everyone here has way more of a life than you ever will.</p>

Ksv is NOT a good mod, did you see all the abuse he did to me? I didn’t cry, I called him a dick, you a pussy and then you blocked me. You’re the pussy, not me. You wouldn’t demote an admin who abuses, then you stick up for him saying that he didn’t abuse when I have proof that he did. Nobody wants to play this server with admins that abuse and get away with it, you couldn’t even fucking change the client name or server name. This is just xpk with firescape, your “coder”(ksv) hasn’t coded a single thing, and all he has done is abused, complained and spammed, so tell me how the fuck is he a good mod? I had to help you with changing the client name, and you couldn’t even fucking get that right. This server and thread reeks of fail.</p>
