    <title>Chaotic claws?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/chaotic-claws/526444</link>
    <description>Are they worth it? Pros/Cons?

I&#39;ve been reading up on the different strategies on wiki for slayer monsters and a lot of them are suggesting chaotic claws. I wasn&#39;t really active when they came out so I&#39;m not sure if they are good or not. I already made the regular chaotic claw just have to make the offhand later to test further. ( I need like... 40k tokens which isn&#39;t bad)</description>

The claws are slash, so whenever something is weak to that, yes. The claws are slightly less damage than a CLS with a higher crit chance, and faster attack speed. Accuracy wise they are the same as any other chaotic.<br>
[/quote]Actually, the damage ends up being the same. With auto attacks, yes the damage is less, but the DPS equals out.</p>
<p>Also, on the topic of weaknesses, you shouldn’t have to worry about specific weaknesses such as slash, stab and crush. The only time where you really want to match the specific weakness is against boss monsters. Otherwise, attacking with the same style (melee/magic/ranged) works perfectly fine.[/quote]oh really?  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>So for kuradel tasks it really won’t matter what I use?</p>
