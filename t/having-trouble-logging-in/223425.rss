    <description>Hi, I played moparscape before, and I was able to go onto other servers. Now, its been a while, and I&#39;m having trouble.

I can make my own server, but I want to be able to go onto other servers. Ill go through step by step what happens.

1. I start moparscape.
2. i do file&gt;new port&gt;(enter the port of some random server from the server list)
3. then,file&gt;new server&gt;(enter the IP of some random server from the list)
4. Then I put click Enter, type in a username and password, and it says
        &quot;no response from server, please try using a different world&quot;

I&#39;m on a iMac G5, I have Safari as web browsser, ummmmmm, i tried to be as helpful as i could. I know you guys deal with lots of noobs trying to get started on this game, and i know it must be stressful helping us out. hopefully you guys know wats wrong and can help me. Thanks a lot.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 01, 2008, 04:59:50 pm[/size][hr]actually, i think Im getting a new types of Error

Now, when i try it says
&quot;Error connecting to the server. Must be down. Click &quot;Cancel&quot; then &quot;start server&quot; to make your own.&quot;</description>
