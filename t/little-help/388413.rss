    <title>Little help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/little-help/388413</link>
    <description>I am not too sure if this is the right section for this, but I will ask anyway.

A while ago, I had a Modem, which was all good with hosting, then we got a router, so we had a modem AND a router.. everything was good, I portforwarded correctly, everything worked to plan.. then we got rid of the Modem and upgraded our Router.

The problem is now, if I change the IP on my computer, my internet doesn&#39;t work.. yes we have a router, but all 3 computers run off the same IP.

I can&#39;t host any RSPS, I can&#39;t host any WC3 Bnet servers, and it is really getting to me... My uncle is a computer nerd, even he couldn&#39;t figure out how to do it, or how to fix it.

Any help?</description>
