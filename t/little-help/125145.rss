    <description>Thank you for looking at my thread.
Please no flaming people who try and help and no spamming.
Ok if you have answer to any of the questions please post on thread.
My server is a pimpscape source.

1. Ive changed my death spawn and login spawn once, changed where my server starts. I just cant remeber what to look for. i know its somthing like ifplayerdead or somthing like that.

2. how do i delete teles, not just what happens when you click on it, i did that how do i delete the actualy icon, same with ancients. or, this would be easier, whats the frame for auto cast cuz that just makes it so u can attk with spells.

3. my server sometimes take runes to cast spells, and when it runs out of runes  you can just keep casting.

4. an actualy tutorial for specials, all the others dont work.

5. list of all emotes if i can get spec&#39;s to work. so it looks like it does special for regular attack.

6. ive already asked this in another thread, how to stop u from hitting like 50s with dds and like 50s with ice blitz, if i cant get it to require runes, i at least want it to hit realistically.

7. Change log in screen, instead of the scroll with text i know the principles of it, (sendframe) or somthing like that i just dont know what to change it to. Like zdiddyscape, that transparent thing is really cool. So zoltanman if you read that would be nice.

8. randomdrops has not been working for me i think im doing somthing wrong. a little clarification on this would be nice, like how do i make it drop &quot;randomly&quot; instead of at intervals.

9. How to make potions like attk, and str lower over time, i tried this once, buti had to delete that one, so i forgot.

10. How to make stalls also give random items, instead of at intervals.

11. Ive made it so you cant hit anything on shop npcs, but shop npcs still retaliate. 

12. Also how do i make it so monsters wont keep attking someone if they teled away, same with pking.

All help is appreciated.
