    <description>I&#39;ve been trying to figure thisout myself for about 2 weeks now. Everyone kept saying do the same as what you would to with the client, but they were wrong. I will be uploading a video once i get home from school aswell. :)

After you have downloaded you source
extract it using your suffit expander.
If you dont already have it witch you
should download it here:

Ok now heres where you might have
trouble. If you have a 317 server then
make a new folder and put the folder with 
the server files into the new folder
you have recently created. Once done with
that put ur run.bat into the folder
you have recently created aswell.
