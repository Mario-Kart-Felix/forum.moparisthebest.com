    <title>Worried about this &quot;SYIpkpker&quot; thing, can anybody give me answers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/worried-about-this-syipkpker-thing-can-anybody-give-me-answers/223836</link>
    <description>Well today is the first day I hosted my server and out of nowhere in like 5 minutes of the server being up, that &quot;SYIpkpker&quot; guy loggs in and does his thing. Now what I&#39;m really worried about is when he kept logging in my computer made a &quot;beeping&quot; noise so I just shut down the server immediately and now I&#39;m here asking for answers. Has anybody have this happen to them....? He loggs in a bunch of times and my computer will make a beeping noise. Does anybody know what&#39;s going on, or what SYIpkpker has to do with my computer beeping? I really hope this is not a bad thing.</description>

              <p>Don’t worry, the SYI program can’t get into your computer, the beeping stands for your computer’s RAM hitting max, it can’t get onto your computer, because well, its just a thing for crashing servers,  can’t do more than that, so don’t believe anyone that says something like “I’m going to SYI your computer” it’s a lie.</p>

              <p>Well the beeping noise does it start automatically when he loggs in if it does close the “command prompt” (the black box) and let it be for a while and then loog back on after a while if this happens over and over just make a new IP in NO-IP DUC.</p>
