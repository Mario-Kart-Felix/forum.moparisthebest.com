    <title>Is 25MB of memory good for holding 100 players (Each thread = 256KB)?</title>

    <description>Well, I have been observing some code in a Login Server, and I saw this:

[code=java]
                new Thread(new Player(client)).start();
[/code]

I saw in the comments that this is a thread which runs a new player with the arguments of the socket of the player. I also saw that this uses 256KB of memory for 1 player (meaning 25MB of memory for holding 100). Is this good?</description>

              <p>use benchmarking tools to figure out if it’s good or not. 500mb for 2k players i suppose isn’t bad considering a proper rs2 server would be pretty meaty (8GB RAM+).</p>

              <p>I’m not too sure but there are definitely other factors which would change the actual final memory usage ;p but it sounds good from my nooby perspective.</p>

              <p>depends on a bit more. The server itself is more than just holding players- it also runs other stuff (npcs, events, etc) that will eat up some memory. Outside of this, I cannot give any knowledge in this area.</p>
