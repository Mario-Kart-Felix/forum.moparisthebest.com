    <description>when i open up me server and press run it says this: you do not have a server.class. make sure you have used the compler with your server BEFORE you try running it.

so i try to compile it and it says: you need to have java files for this compiler to compile.

what should i do?

(i used compiler from tutorial on how to make a server)</description>
