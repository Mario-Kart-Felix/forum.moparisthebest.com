    <title>[317 - DELTA] OleanPkz - Web Client, great server, NEED GFX DESIGNER [read]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-delta-oleanpkz-web-client-great-server-need-gfx-designer-read/431499</link>
    <description>OleanPkz is my server that I have been working on for quite some time now. I plan on putting it online February 20th hosted on a VPS. On the 17th I will begin to make a web client. (Well, try anyways.) Following the Web Client I will apply for a position on MoparScape&#39;s Server Status Page for a sponsored spot on the Top 8.


Right now everything looks great, but I need someone to make good looking interface&#39;s.

I need it to look nice and I can&#39;t make stuff look nice with paint.

If you could help, I&#39;m sure we could arrange some sort of &quot;donation&quot;.</description>
