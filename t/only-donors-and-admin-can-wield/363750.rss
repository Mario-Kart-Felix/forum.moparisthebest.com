    <title>Only donors and admin+ can wield</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/only-donors-and-admin-can-wield/363750</link>
    <description>i know this has been done many of times, but all the codes i have tried are not compatible with my server.

i dont have wearID, i have something like getItems().sendWeapon(playerEquipment[playerWeapon]

how would i make it so only donors or admins+ can wield. 

this is going to be a spawn server. 

thanks to anyone who can help me</description>
