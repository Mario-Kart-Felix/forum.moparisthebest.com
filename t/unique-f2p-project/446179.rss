    <title>Unique F2P Project</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unique-f2p-project/446179</link>
    <description>[b]hello, I was thinking of making a new server, a f2p style server.
I have seen some sources that are f2p but they are outdated and crap. I am going to start building my server with possible 317 or 711. these are some of my idea&#39;s I could possibly add/code into the server (I probably could code most or all of this in.) [/b] 

-dungeoneering skill for gravite weapons like rs
-token drop for killing monsters &amp; bosses to purchase Rune berserker shield  and bronze to rune gauntlets with the tokens.
-Another idea I thought of making is possibly adding pvp drops when you kill another player you can get a low chance of getting a Corrupted dragon weapon/armour piece (higher chance more the risk)
-making PvMing still worth value, by making it drop items like rune weapons and armour &amp; possibly bosses to drop god armor (saradomin, zammorak and guthix) and add extra str bonus&#39;s to the god armor
-a couple of minigames to earn exp/items
-every f2p skills avaliable.
-achievements + rewards.
-if you have anything to suggest I should add, il appreciate it.

I wanted to know how you guys would think the server would be and if it would be worth my time to code all this, since im finished all my exams i will have a lot of spare time. If you guys think it would possibly be a good server, I will need help with npc+item models and possibly some coding help.

Question and anwsers
Q: Why would you want to play a f2p style server you might ask,
A:well because i thought it would be a unique experience, and out of the 1000&#39;s of rsps this one will be 
different and would attract more players because it&#39;s unique from other servers.

Q:Do you even know how to code all this?
A:I have some experience coding and i probably could code most of this
but if I couldn&#39;t, I will request a coder in server developement for help.

anymore questions or if you have suggestions i should add to the server in the future.
If you think this will be a waste of time or if you like this idea, please tell me
because I need some feedback.</description>

              <p>There aren’t really any bosses for F2P players, so are you going to have some P2P things in there? Perhaps some simple P2P bosses e.g. Giant Mole, KBD (team based PVM boss as it would be incredibly difficult to solo it with a Rune Scimitar), etc. Basically the bosses that don’t require higher bonus gear (rather than GWD bosses, Corporeal Beast, etc.).</p>
<p>Assuming you will have some things in there that are from P2P:<br>
If it’s a 317…<br>
-Castle Wars<br>
-Custom skilling minigame, perhaps a remake of Stealing Creations or something of the sort.<br>
-Custom quests<br>
-Achievement Diaries</p>
<p>If it’s a 711…<br>
-Clan Wars<br>
-Fist of Guthix (as other means to get the Rune Beserker Shield, Rune Gauntlets, and more powerful Magic gear.)<br>
-Tasks (same thing as Achievement Diaries)</p>

              <p>If you are going to host this and shit like that, i would copy all server packets into a dedi or even a completely different base, as this is probably DeltaScape based. Its unstable as a fat pigeon on a floating chip.</p>
