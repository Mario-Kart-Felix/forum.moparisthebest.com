F2P world &amp; instance soon done!

Me &amp; Termz have been working on a F2P server lately, and i&#39;ve been working on RuneScape&#39;s classics first instance!

On the following URL you&#39;ll find a sample of the instance(It&#39;s about 60% done)
http://se.youtube.com/watch?v=o_YtOVdkBjM&amp;fmt=18

Credits for the landscape editor goes to: xEnt, Peter &amp; Vrunk

The F2P world won&#39;t have any P2p items, no P2P citys, no P2P skills
-------------------------------------------
Allright, so it&#39;s time for advertising.

Currently i&#39;ve been working on a client where you move with the arrows(up, down, left &amp; right), it&#39;s still a bit buggy therefor i will not launch the beta yet. However this is a great server and there will be no powerabusing, as we get a little more members we will launch an event where you can win prizes, for example a partyhat.

The website has been completly remade by Termz to &#39;piff&#39; up the boring old forums. He tried to make the website just as RSClassics website was before.

This server also has a donators area, where you can freely train your stats. This is to keep up with the server costs, currently we rent a dedicated server for 120$ a month.

Termz has also made &#39;Recovery Questions&#39; so that stolen accounts can be drawnback by the owner.

You can ONLY play on the webclient, any sort of modified/non official client is strictly forbidden, so is autoing.

Here is some screenshots:

Hope to see you there!

              <p>an Instance is a WoW feature, a dungeon where you enter a special map (like the way a RS2 house works, uses the same map but different groups of players can enter without seeing each other) inside the instance theres lots of NPC’s and bosses to kill that drop nice loot, but require teamwork.</p>
<p>I doubt this “instance” on this server will come close to anything like i just mentioned. gj though</p>
