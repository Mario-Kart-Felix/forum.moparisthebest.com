    <title>A few problems with my server [Delta]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-problems-with-my-server-delta/352204</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using a delta source and i&#39;m not really sure how to fix this problem. If some one freezes me and runs away, I can hit them with melee from a few squares away. I&#39;m pretty sure there is a fix for this I just don&#39;t know how to do it.

The second problem is kind of hard to explain so i have a video of it.

The second problem doesn&#39;t seem to happen all the time for me but my hoster is saying it happens every time he tries to spec.

The last one isn&#39;t that big but i still want to fix it. When i equip infinity boots i turn invisible. If anyone can help me with any of these problems that would be great.</description>
