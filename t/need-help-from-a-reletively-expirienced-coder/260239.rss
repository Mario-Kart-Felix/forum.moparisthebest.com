    <title>Need help from a reletively expirienced coder</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-from-a-reletively-expirienced-coder/260239</link>
    <description>im new to this stuff. ive only been on here for like 2 days. i used to have a server with my friend that we made from scratch but its been like two years and im completely blanked out. if i break a rule im sorry i dont know them. anywaays. this topic is about finding someone to teach me.

i learn better when its &quot;hands on&quot;... meaning it would help if someone made a server with me to help me learn it.

umm. i posted one of these posts in a &quot;wrong section&quot; and it got locked or whatever so i hope this is the right section lol :p

please consider...please</description>
