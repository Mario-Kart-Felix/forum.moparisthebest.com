    <description>I am attempting to add dragonclaw models to the battlescape client.

new to clients

I am using this guide as an outline, http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,363483.0.html

I am not to sure what to do, I know I add the items to itemdef But, I can&#39;t find where to put the models so they can be loaded. I just keep getting errors. Looking in Item def, they have some models going up to 18000+ but [b]i can&#39;t access pali_cache or anything, to find out where these models are.[/b]Need some help or a good point in the right direction
