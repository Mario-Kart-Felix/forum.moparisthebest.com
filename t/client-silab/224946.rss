              <p>[quote=“dylan_0789, post:2, topic:224946”]you need to change the item IDs around in the client and set them up as silabsoft. and if the client doesnt have the items, you need to find out the drop/inv model id and the equiped id(male and female for armor)… Some clients have an “itemdump.txt” which just lists the Equipment and its model ids.  After you have them, you go into Class8.JAVA and add them one by one.<br>
i.e a godsword would be:</p>
<p><code>
if(i == 15334){         \\ItemID
class8.aStringArray189 = new String[5];
class8.aStringArray189[1] = "Wear";     \\Options
class8.anIntArray156 = new int[1];       \\numb of old colors changed
class8.anIntArray160 = new int[1];       \\numb of new colors
class8.anIntArray156[0] = 0;    \\old color ID
class8.anIntArray160[0] = 0;    \\new color ID
class8.anInt174 = 7354;     \\item drop/inv model
class8.anInt181 = 1957;
class8.anInt190 = 498;
class8.anInt198 = 484;
class8.anInt204 = 0;
class8.anInt169 = -1;
class8.anInt194 = -1;
class8.anInt165 = 7355;     \\male equiped
class8.anInt200 = 7244;     \\female equiped
class8.anInt175 = -1;
class8.anInt197 = -1;
class8.aString170 = "Bandos godsword ";   \\item name
class8.aByteArray178 = "A great weapon, used by the best warriors.".getBytes();     \\"examine" info
}</code></p>
<p>the “\comments” are just to explain what those htings mean and are not needed in the actual code. mainly all the rest of the class8.aInt’s are for how the model appears in inventory. correct me if im wrong someone.</p>
<p>Anyways, i hope this was helpful.[/quote]</p>
