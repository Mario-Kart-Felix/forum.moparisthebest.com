    <title>How to store passwords correctly</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-store-passwords-correctly/334388</link>
    <description>I&#39;m wondering about what is considered the &#39;best&#39; method of handling and storing user passwords is (on a non-secure connection).

In all my applications, the user sends their password in plaintext and it&#39;s stored in the database as a SHA1 hash. I don&#39;t think this is secure though, because their password can easily be read by someone on the network or through some other security issue where a users request can be intercepted. A way to overcome this would be to hash the password in JavaScript, but this would mean that anyone with the hashed version of the users password could login to their account, and it may also be easier to bruteforce a hash instead of a variable length &amp; charset raw password.

What about double hashing, would that be safer or would that have no effect? I&#39;m just wondering what the standard approach to this sort of stuff is, so don&#39;t flame me because I&#39;m asking such a general question.</description>

              <p>Why can’t you just stop being bad and use SSL?  That will put all sniffing attempts to rest, hashing with JS or whatever before sending is just another layer of useless crap for the potential hacker to get around if they wanted access to a user’s account, and it’s not like they can’t resort to other methods (such as keylogging, which SSL wouldn’t be able to do shit about anyway).  Regardless, I wouldn’t say packet sniffing is that common in your everyday trojan.</p>

Debatable. If the user uses the same password everywhere then hashing it before it gets sent is safer. And I imagine that a lot of users do fall into this category.<br>
At least by hashing it before sending, they aren’t potentially undermining the security of other accounts they hold for other services.</p>

I forgot to mention that I do salt the passwords in the database, I was thinking more along the lines of how to send the password. Are the reasons against hashing with JS the only ones that I stated, or are there others too?</p>
<p>Also, Firefox makes all my users think that my site will automatically install over 9000 viruses on their computer because I haven’t paid shit loads for a valid certificate. Unless there is a way to get valid SSL certificates for free?</p>
<p>Edit: Yes eczema, injection was implied in my post. I view JS as having zero security, because the user can easily make their own client and send whatever data they like.</p>

<p>Also probably vulnerable to injection somewhere along the line, because JS can easily be fucked with.</p>
