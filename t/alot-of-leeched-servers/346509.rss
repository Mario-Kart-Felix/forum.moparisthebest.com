    <title>Alot of leeched servers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/alot-of-leeched-servers/346509</link>
    <description>Well I was bored of coding, attempting to create a pvp following.. but still no luck, so I decided to look around on moparscape&#39;s server status for some decent pk servers to, well you know pk on.
When I noticed just about every server has everything, and I mean EVERYTHING the same.
Why are there so many leeching noobs?
and lmao most of them get donations?</description>

<p>But most of the hosters on the serverstatus hasn’t really changed anything, and they have been there for awhile…<br>
If you log onto the server they will claim they created it all… or pretty close to every feature on the server, mostly what I am saying is they should give credit, where credit it due…<br>

<p>They should, but its a fact of life. People will claim anything they can outta something thats possible to do it with to make themselves feel better about it.

<p><span class="mention">@jmood</span> - Ive done that to several people. I had their MSN, so i just nulled the server till they unbanned me. (they claimed i couldnt…)[/quote]</p>
<p>I believe that there should be a rule, so that they must claim what the base was or at least the creator… and that doesn’t mean track it back to it’s original roots…<br>
as in if they download an allstar, changed a few things…<br>
at least state that it’s allstar based in the beginning…<br>
I mean if I someone stole, or copied a server you made and released, claimed every single credit for creating it…<br>
i’m sure you wont be like, it’s all cool…<br>
no you will be like: WTF is the shizz?</p>

<p>I remember when I joined a server a few months back, the owner said they made the whole server and that they are a pro Java programmer, they were using allstar. I was like “dude your ling this is allstar scape I bet you don’t know how to change what the npc’s say”, they banned me after I said that.</p>

Its because that is the only thing most of RSPS hosters actually know how to do. So, why not do what you can, to give it that 2% uniqueness, rather than learn what you can before hosting it. I personally did that when I first started, but i have my reason for that…</p>
<p>MY REASON - Its because I wanted to get opinions from the players, before making a new thing, or getting rid of something. I find it better to have a community formed  server, rather than one from the eyes of the hoster.</p>

Which could be considered the same thing as selling staff powers, you know.<br>
donate = powerful item<br>
donate = mod</p>
<p>same thing they get power out of donating to some lazy kid?<br>
seems like the same as the selling admins and mods to me…</p>
<p>the only thing i believe should be sold is memberships.</p>

<p>It’s not the source, it’s how people manage them, if they have a good staff base and good people that play and monitor the server and come up with the money for sponsored servers, why care mate? theres no point getting worked up over something like that.</p>
