    <title>Help with making trees turn into stumps then regrow after time</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-making-trees-turn-into-stumps-then-regrow-after-time/361699</link>
    <description>Ok, so im adding onto pk planet source and made cutting logs different times so its not always every 2 seconds. I also am trying to make it so once some one starts to cut a tree the client sets a randomized number for how many logs the tree has. Then every time the player took a log out of the tree it would decremint the number of logs the tree has left. Then once the tree has 0 logs left it is replaced by a tree stump. Then a counter would start at a pre determined countdown in seconds depending on the tree. Once the counter is done it would replace the treestump with the tree of its kind.

Now since u understand what im trying to do heres where i need help.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
for understanding how many logs the tree has left i should set an 4 dimensional array like this:

Trees [100] [1] [1] [1] [1]

100 is the total amount of trees i want to watch over at once.

first 1 is the x position of the tree.

second 1 is the y position of the tree.

third 1 is the kind of tree.

fourth 1 is how many logs r left in the tree.

fifth 1 is the current millisecs timer since it was cut down.
------------------------------------------------------------

I know i should set something up serverside so every player could recognize how many logs r in the tree but i just want it in client first then i can do that later. My main question bout that is is it ok to set it up in an array like that then loop through them to see if the tree needs to be replaced with a stump.

The other problem i was thinking of is where i should put the loop of all the trees to see if they need to be replaced in the client.java? I am not that well known where to put continous if statements if the client is idle...

This is 317 and i know a thing or 2 with java, just now how 317s r built/work.</description>
