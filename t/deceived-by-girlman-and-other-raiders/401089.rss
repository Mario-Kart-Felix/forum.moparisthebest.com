    <title>Deceived by girlman and other raiders</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/deceived-by-girlman-and-other-raiders/401089</link>
    <description>ok. so i was on in the process of moving from the UE to a new plot of land 1000&#39;s of blocks away from spawn. this person i dont even remember his name it was like jop something or other. said he was new so i said he could stay with me if he want. so he followed me to the new spot where i was going to make my city.

i let him have stuff like my watch and i made him a map. i get on today and guess what every single valuable thing i had is gone. 3 blocks of diamond that i just mined, couple blocks of gold, 20 some blocks of iron, 3 stacks of bricks.... all our diamond tools. the list goes on. girlman and xvizard raided us. and it wouldnt have been possible if that noob wouldnt have lead them to us. idk if the noob was girlman on a second account or a friend of one of the ppl that raided me and my friends.

none of our chest were locked b/c we were still in the process of moving from our old location.

call me an idiot for letting someone follow me but im a nice person and anyone i will treat nice, and trust them until they give me a reason to not be nice, or to trust them.

im nice enough if anyone needed something all they would have to do is ask for something and i would give it to them but no its a hell of a lot bet just to steal from me...

idk im just upset enough im feeling like leaving this server. i would like to know if this jop person had any affiliation to girlman and xvizard. and if he was one of them or a friend of theirs i find it extremely unhonorable that they would take advantage of my kindness, and generosity to steal from me. to me stealing should be on the same level as greifing.

i definitely cant wait for the new plugin thats all i can say.</description>

ok. well i didnt put the chests up. my cousin said they were hidden then later i told him no they werent. my cousin thought stealing was against the rules. could u ask him if he would give some stuff back? those stacks of bricks were for my house they were from my old house and if had those bricks since the beginning of this server map. also the diamond tools would be nice to have back, if not he can add me to his list of enemies.<br>
[/quote]I think girlman gave the stuff to xx matty xx tho I’m not sure. I should have enough stuff to give you everything you lost back. I’ll just have to be more careful when leading people to my place.<br>
[/quote]I wondered what all that was about. He gave me a compass (which I gave back because I wouldn’t use it), 2 diamonds and like 20 iron ore. Maybe he’s been distributing the stuff to different people?[/quote]</p>
<p>You turned away items? tut, you’re loosing it Matt. Anyway, you know why girlman was giving you items. He usually gives them to me but I wasn’t on.</p>

ok. well i didnt put the chests up. my cousin said they were hidden then later i told him no they werent. my cousin thought stealing was against the rules. could u ask him if he would give some stuff back? those stacks of bricks were for my house they were from my old house and if had those bricks since the beginning of this server map. also the diamond tools would be nice to have back, if not he can add me to his list of enemies.<br>
[/quote]I think girlman gave the stuff to xx matty xx tho I’m not sure. I should have enough stuff to give you everything you lost back. I’ll just have to be more careful when leading people to my place.[/quote]I wondered what all that was about. He gave me a compass (which I gave back because I wouldn’t use it), 2 diamonds and like 20 iron ore. Maybe he’s been distributing the stuff to different people?</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, how do you think the new plugin would have helped you with this?  Since you can only protect 1 place at a time, the same thing would have happened, right?</p>
