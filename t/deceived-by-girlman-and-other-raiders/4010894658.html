Out of curiosity, how do you think the new plugin would have helped you with this?  Since you can only protect 1 place at a time, the same thing would have happened, right?<br>

<p>b/c that place would have been protected. and the old place wouldnt have been.[/quote]</p>
<p>Then why wasn’t that chest protected, and the old chest wasn’t?  Same thing, is it not?</p>

Is it possible to automatically whitelist junior+ members on the forums and allow them to have up to 3 locked chests?</p>
<p>And while you’re at it, add a field called “Minecraft password” in our profiles. I do not feel secure at all typing my forum password openly in minecraft like that.[/quote]</p>
<p>So people spam on the forums before they grief?  No thanks.  Also, the chest locking plugin is going away in favor of residence.</p>
<p>I would agree with you if I didn’t run the minecraft server on the same box as the forum, what could possibly be not secure about it?  (unless you log onto the wrong server or something)</p>
