          <blockquote>
              <p>Create a void that teleports him back to a place (with his items) if he dies within those specific coordinates. If you just put the public void for death, he will loose his items. You can also create an if statement within the public void for death to identify your dieing in a safe place causing you to not lose items, but it might just create complications. I hope that made sense <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
