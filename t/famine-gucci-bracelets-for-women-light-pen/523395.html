        <p>Touted as Mark McGwire’s not-so-secret weapon in his home run smacking arsenal, Androstenedione has been recommended to increase levels of the men hormone testosterone. Now comes the first proof that the risks may possibly far outweigh virtually any benefits reports Cbs television studios News Correspondent John Roberts.Researchers at the University of Iowa studied 20 men who required the manufacturer’s advised dose of 300mg/day, and discovered Androstenedione did not raise androgenic hormone or testosterone levels nor that increase strength. That did, however, lower levels of good cholesterol, increasing the risk for heart problems. Harvard researcher Fergie Finkelstein, who is conducting a larger study of Androstenedione regarding Major League Baseball, says presently there appear to be other side effects. "Androstenedione increases estrogen levels of males, and it is possible that that may lead to such things as breast implants."Critics of the supplement state that it is enough evidence to take Androstenedione off the marketplace. Its use is currently banned by the Olympic games, the NCAA and American footbal. Major League Baseball, which allows participants to take Androstenedione, is expected to revisit the issue when its own study is done later this summer.  <a href="http://www.shinglespringsdreamhomes.com/guccihandbags.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.shinglespringsdreamhomes.com/guccihandbags.html</a><br>
