    <description>[s]Hai guise. So yeah, I have one mint cake (street price 4m+) and since I don&#39;t have junk at all (about 100k) I want to give it basically for free to someone who has an ags on one condition: you lend it to me for 24hrs and buy my junk worth of 160k = you get mint.[/s]


nevermind ;D i&#39;ll keep it and sell it away when i have enough junk</description>

</aside>
<p>The idea is for a group of very wealthy players to buy up all the mint cakes, and then agree upon a new price. A variety of factors can come into play. I’d venture a guess that their thought process was similar to this:</p>
<p>We want this to be an artificial rare item, but we want it to be affordable. We could always make them worth 100mil each, but would there be enough (worthless) longbows in circulation to translate from the official price to our price? Even if there were enough longbows, would it be affordable for the average well-off player?..</p>
<p>You have to keep in mind that the whole scheme is based on the idea of a ‘worthless’ item. Even if I gave you a ton of longbows, there’s pretty much nothing you could do with them by virtue of there being zero demand for them. If they aren’t careful, the demand for longbows will outweigh the supply and the bubble will burst early. They’re going to want to choose a price that will maximize their profits once they flood the market back up with mint cakes.</p>

              <p>[quote=“unlimitedorb, post:27, topic:324053”]If I understand this correctly, the end result of all of this is players controlling market liquidity and value.</p>
<p>It becomes easier to understand this if we talk in terms of <span class="bbcode-b">extremes</span>:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Player A</span> - Suppose I’m trying to sell longbows via the Grand Exchange, but I’m unable to sell a single longbow because the demand for them is essentially zero. Even though the Grand Exchange sets the ‘official’ price at 1k [sic] per longbow, the <span class="bbcode-i">effective</span> price of a longbow is 0.</p>
<p>Now suppose that mint cakes are worth very little - 2k ea:<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Player B</span> - An extremely wealthy user comes along and buys up all the mint cakes in the game. The Grand Exchange reports the official price as 2k per mint cake, but the <span class="bbcode-i">effective</span> price of a mint cake is however much the wealthy user dictates.</p>
<p>Now, here’s where it gets interesting: Player B decides to sell one of his <span class="bbcode-i">effectively</span> priceless mint cakes for 4mil. The Grand Exchange still reports the ‘official’ price of a mint cake as 2k. How will he transfer the mint cake?</p>
<p>Player A and Player B discuss the situation with eachother and they come to a mutual agreement that, despite what the Grand Exchange says, a Longbow is worth 0k and a mint cake is worth 4mil. This is the key.</p>
<p>Player A offers 4mil to Player B.</p>
<p>Player B puts up a mint cake ‘officially’ worth 2k but <span class="bbcode-i">effectively</span> worth 4mil. He then add longbows that are ‘officially’ worth 4mil but <span class="bbcode-i">effectively</span> worth 0k. This makes up for the Grand Exchange price difference.</p>
<p>This is a dangerous precedent. This means that Player B, in this case, is more ‘official’ than the Grand Exchange itself. By putting the power to dictate prices into Player B’s hands, Player B has circumvented the reason for the Grand Exchange’s existence! This concept will eventually make Player B far more wealthy than before… what if he then decided to silently sell off all his mint cakes until the market is flooded, etc?</p>
<p>It follows that we can profit from this in the real world by setting up a consortium of players that dictate prices. They could even have a website that translates Grand Exchange prices to consortium prices.  That would most likely generate alot of traffic. It seems as though this concept is still in its infant stages for RS. If someone decided to take the time to organize it and they had enough access to resources, they could profit big time off of this.[/quote]<br>
much appreciated explanation, I didn’t have a fucking clue what was going on</p>

So the transaction is 4mil for 1 mint cake and (at 1k ea) 3999 longbows. For the person selling the mint cake this transaction is attractive, but what does the buyer of the mint cake gain?<br>

          <blockquote>
              <p>If I understand this correctly, the end result of all of this is players controlling market liquidity and value.</p>
<p>It becomes easier to understand this if we talk in terms of <span class="bbcode-b">extremes</span>:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Player A</span> - Suppose I’m trying to sell longbows via the Grand Exchange, but I’m unable to sell a single longbow because the demand for them is essentially zero. Even though the Grand Exchange sets the ‘official’ price at 1k [sic] per longbow, the <span class="bbcode-i">effective</span> price of a longbow is 0.</p>
<p>Now suppose that mint cakes are worth very little - 2k ea:<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Player B</span> - An extremely wealthy user comes along and buys up all the mint cakes in the game. The Grand Exchange reports the official price as 2k per mint cake, but the <span class="bbcode-i">effective</span> price of a mint cake is however much the wealthy user dictates.</p>
<p>Now, here’s where it gets interesting: Player B decides to sell one of his <span class="bbcode-i">effectively</span> priceless mint cakes for 4mil. The Grand Exchange still reports the ‘official’ price of a mint cake as 2k. How will he transfer the mint cake?</p>
<p>Player A and Player B discuss the situation with eachother and they come to a mutual agreement that, despite what the Grand Exchange says, a Longbow is worth 0k and a mint cake is worth 4mil. This is the key.</p>
<p>Player A offers 4mil to Player B.</p>
<p>Player B puts up a mint cake ‘officially’ worth 2k but <span class="bbcode-i">effectively</span> worth 4mil. He then add longbows that are ‘officially’ worth 4mil but <span class="bbcode-i">effectively</span> worth 0k. This makes up for the Grand Exchange price difference.</p>
<p>This is a dangerous precedent. This means that Player B, in this case, is more ‘official’ than the Grand Exchange itself. By putting the power to dictate prices into Player B’s hands, Player B has circumvented the reason for the Grand Exchange’s existence! This concept will eventually make Player B far more wealthy than before… what if he then decided to silently sell off all his mint cakes until the market is flooded, etc?</p>
<p>It follows that we can profit from this in the real world by setting up a consortium of players that dictate prices. They could even have a website that translates Grand Exchange prices to consortium prices.  That would most likely generate alot of traffic. It seems as though this concept is still in its infant stages for RS. If someone decided to take the time to organize it and they had enough access to resources, they could profit big time off of this.</p>

I’m sure Jagex thought highly of themselves, being the first to go down the path of prohibition. Except some paths are seldom walked for a reason. Senator Conroy of Australia is doing the same by trying to forcefully make ISPs censor a <em>secret</em> list of URLs with what is ultimately a pretty loosely defined and easily expandable scope (Refused classification). Glad to see that Australia is getting into bed with North Korea, China, Burma and Iran.<br>
