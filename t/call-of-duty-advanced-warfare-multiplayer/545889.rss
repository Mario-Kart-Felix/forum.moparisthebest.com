    <title>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare Multiplayer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-multiplayer/545889</link>
    <description>The multiplayer looks pretty cool. And don&#39;t be one of those assholes who complains that it&#39;s the same COD over and over again, and now that they&#39;ve changed it it&#39;s not COD anymore. Seriously, fudge off.
I love the way you can super jump, and you can cloak yourself too, the game&#39;ll be much more fun than it used to be.

<p>That’s why I said they should mix extinction and zombies together. Extinction has a better story and you level up with perks and stuff. If only MW3 was zombies…</p>

              <p>You guys are thinking about only the multiplayer tbh. What about the rest of the game? There’s probably going to be better physics and dynamic areas along with newer features that they just haven’t announced yet. I my self am not a big call of duty fan (I loved MW1 campaign though along with BO2 campaign and survival) but I still play the game just for the sake of something new to do. So I’m looking forward to new game modes and a new story to play.</p>
<p>IMO, I liked zombies better than Extinction, the survival most of the time. The story for zombie was just bullshit, like wut. I liked run and gun zombies. If the story was more like extinction, then it’d be a great game. Campaign was pretty dope too.</p>
<p>Multiplayer, all I think is new weapons and new map with changed button color and icon for all call of dutys.</p>

              <p>Black Ops was decent, but it still didn’t have that kick ass feel like MW and MW2 did. Both MW games had excellent maps, and for the most part they gave a good balance to all guns (at least the starting guns). I received MW3 for Christmas when it had recently been released, played 3 games and said nope. The amount of camping RPG ass holes and Auto shotgun skiddies was unbearable.</p>

              <p>Kind of hate to do this but I am going to be that asshole that complains about it being the same game every year.</p>
<p>I mean seriously, why should that viewpoint be immediately ignored? If ANY other franchise was releasing the same game over and over and over, you wouldn’t give it a second look.</p>
<p>COD is a very well-programmed game with horrible development choices. I’ve given up on the series a few games ago just because it’s so painful to see them making the same mistakes over and over again. And the worst part is, none of the players care! Of course a 12 year old will bask in the enjoyment of using an overpowered gun or perk, because otherwise he would die every time. They’ve changed the entire scope of FPSs for the worst, at least in my view.</p>
<p>I also think nolan makes a great point to the fact that just because they’re making so many in the series isn’t an excuse to be making the same game. The Elder Scrolls has done a fabulous job of providing a unique experience with each title, I mean just go play Morrowind for an hour or watch a video on it to compare it to Skyrim. They are hardly comparable. At lot of that obviously has to do with the time spent on the The Elder Scrolls as he mentioned, but isn’t that the point? I don’t see how any developers could create a unique experience every year. It’s really just an immature franchise made for immature players.</p>

<p>Just the fact that they only put a years work into these Call of Duty games nowadays is why they will never become anything exciting anymore. Games like Elder Scrolls, Borderlands, Halo, etc… take 3-5 years to release a main title game; which is why they’re so well programmed. Not to mention the fact that some people don’t even experience all of Call of Duty before they release a new one with similar attributes.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>^ This. Aside from Battlefield 4’s technical glitches, at least even they wait a couple years and attempt to create a new engine with new game features before they kick out another. Just a disclaimer, I am not taking Hardline into consideration because that game is an abomination and they’re abusing the battlefield title with that game.</p>
<p>Honestly besides the jumps and the new game types, this game doesn’t seem very different from its predecessors. You now have a mech suit or something along the lines to help you jump and cloak, etc., but past that it’s still the same run and gun, quickscope game that has existed since CoD MW.</p>

So they pulled a yet another call of duty, new maps, new weapons, sell for $60, the graphics are so outdated, they havent getting any better since ~mw3<br>
But hey, stupid kids keep buying them, so why should they change anything?</p>

              <p>Just the fact that they only put a years work into these Call of Duty games nowadays is why they will never become anything exciting anymore. Games like Elder Scrolls, Borderlands, Halo, etc… take 3-5 years to release a main title game; which is why they’re so well programmed. Not to mention the fact that some people don’t even experience all of Call of Duty before they release a new one with similar attributes.</p>

I love the way you can super jump, and you can cloak yourself too, the game’ll be much more fun than it used to be.</p>
