    <title>How to make client open in full screen?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-client-open-in-full-screen/395377</link>
    <description>Okay, I&#39;ve seen a few clients do this before. Not many do it, but I just want to know how. There are a lot of clients that are fullscreen, yes I know.. But I want to make it so my client stretches to the players screen resolution when opened. For example, when the player launches the client, it stretches to full screen meaning nothing else can be seen besides the game itself. I know its possible because I seen it done before. Any ideas? Thanks!</description>
