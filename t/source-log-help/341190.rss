              <p>try going on the character files and making your own character. Copy the codes from the other character files into yours.<br>
put this:</p>
<p>[ACCOUNT]<br>
character-username = (((your username)))<br>
character-password = (((your password)))</p>
<p>copy the rest from the other character files.</p>
<p>take this if you have no other files, this is my character. Put a space ontop of every other category. Example:</p>
