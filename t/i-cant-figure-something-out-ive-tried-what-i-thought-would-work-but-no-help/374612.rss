And he walks right through what i thought to be were he couldn&#39;t walk

Il show you what i did

In autospawn:
[code=java]spawn = 2881	3363	9650	0	3358	9653	3368	9645	1
spawn = 2881	3374	9640	0	3377	9645	3368	9635	1
spawn = 2881	3363	9629	0	3358	9635	3368	9626	1
spawn = 2881	3353	9640	0	3358	9645	3350	9635	1[/code]

I thought that would work by adding those other things .,..



Can someone help me by making it so he can&#39;t walk up to u after att.</description>
