    <title>508 client annoying error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-client-annoying-error/325341</link>
    <description>Srry if this sounds stupid or some1 else already answer, but i recently got into private server hosting and i have this annoying problem with 508 clients. i would log in and everything is fine, but say 5 minutes later i get disconnected and i totally cant load the client anymore. so i check to see anything different bout the client and i then notice that the compliling was kinda weird. i no for a fact that i got my java setting rights as well as the java used for the compiler, but i get sone weird error saying:
note: some input files are uncheck or unsafe operation
note: recompile blah blah blah

Any1 no a nice solution for poor old me? :| :|</description>

<p>It’s not an error, it’s basically just the compiler telling you there’s a better way to do what you’re doing. if you do javac -Xlint:deprecation it will show you the deprecated methods</p>
