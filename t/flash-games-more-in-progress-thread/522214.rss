    <title>Flash Games &amp; More [In Progress Thread]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/flash-games-more-in-progress-thread/522214</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve decided to make a thread here, because it&#39;s kind of slow in this section, and I&#39;m making like 5-6 flash projects at once (Not all are games though). Most projects [u]will[/u] have an online demo for everyone to enjoy. But you have to remember, they aren&#39;t finished, and they are alpha/beta&#39;s.

Project 1:

[center]Heart Repair
[hr][/center]

[b]What is it?:[/b]
This is a multi-puzzle game that I started a few weeks ago and then abandoned. One day I saw it, got inspired and kept working on it. I&#39;m currently working on the second level, which is time consuming because of all the checks and placement values :)

[b]What are the challenges?:[/b]
It starts out as a puzzle, where you must put the pieces of the heart into the right position (this isn&#39;t very hard ;) ). Once you finish that you move on to level 2. You have to put stitches on the heart to stop it from bleeding. I believe I&#39;ve added all the stitches that I want on to the heart, but I haven&#39;t coded them all :o.

[b]Etc:[/b]
The game is red/black themed, because what better colors for a heart? :P I haven&#39;t been writing the [u]best[/u] code I could be for it, but that&#39;s why it&#39;s a beta. I do need idea&#39;s for level 3, I was thinking maybe putting the heart into the body or something? I haven&#39;t fully decided.

[b]Live Demo:[/b]
Just like I said, there&#39;s a live demo up and running.
[url=http://nyx-online.info/files/heartGame/heartGame.html] Alpha version[/url] - This was the very start of the project, so it&#39;s no where near done, or up to date.
[url=http://nyx-online.info/files/heartGame/heartGameR2.html] Beta R1[/url] - Here&#39;s my first official &#39;beta&#39; of the game. It&#39;s still only up to the second level. And I&#39;ve made improvements on my version since release (such as not having to click the check option on the stitches/pieces).

Please tell me what you think, and what I should add/edit/modify. Flaming/Hatred won&#39;t be tolerated. I know flash is &quot;Dying&quot; but I don&#39;t care, there&#39;s still plenty of sites that are willing to host flash games.

Project 2:

[center]Imgur Vote Cannon
[hr][/center]

[b]What is it?:[/b]
The game is based off of http://imgur.com/ and how people on there act. I haven&#39;t mapped out the entire game yet, but there are 2 cannons (game modes) you can pick. Upvote cannon, and Downvote cannon. I was thinking something like something would randomly fly on the screen (like a picture of a cat, or &#39;selfie&#39;). And if you&#39;re using the upvote cannon, you upvote cute cats and how-to guides, and don&#39;t hit things like selfies, and reposts. If you&#39;re using the downvote cannon, you do the opposite.

[b]What are the challenges?:[/b]
This hasn&#39;t been mapped out yet..

[b]Etc:[/b]
Also hasn&#39;t been mapped out yet.

[b]Live Demo:[/b]
Not online yet

-More projects to be posted (as soon as I find em ;) )</description>
