    <title>2 PROBLEMS! Please read!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2-problems-please-read/319751</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, as the title says I have two problems and here they are...

1.      [RESOLVED BY RELMITOS!]
&lt;blockquote&gt;I need help with the run button.
In my server I have the run switch in the tools sidebar (the wrench sign thing).
It&#39;s all one button for both run and walk.
So I have it set up so when you log in you&#39;re running, and then you click it to walk. And then click it to run again.
But when you click it to run again it is still walking. Here&#39;s my code:
[code]			case 74192:
				if (c.playerEnergy &gt; 0) {
					c.isRunning2 = false;
					c.isRunning = false;
				break;
				} else {
				if (!c.isRunning2 &amp;&amp; !c.isRunning) {
					c.isRunning = true;
					c.isRunning2 = true;
				break;
				}
			}[/code]

What&#39;s wrong? Why can&#39;t you  make the player run again?
Post ideas and solutions please.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
---------EDIT--------
or maybe if someone can tell me how to switch my emote sidebar back to the old one, so it has 2 separate buttons for run and walk. Also my emotes have been messed up due to adding in the GS emotes. :S

Problem 2:

Alright for problem 2, I would like to stop X-logging.
I have a basic idea already. Make it so tht if the player is in combat and they disconnect there will be a disconnect delay of 15 seconds. or somethinng like that.
Could someone tell me if this is right?</description>

              <p>No idea about that, sorry.<br>
But about the emotes, my guess is that you havent closed the cases in the switch statement. There has to be a break; at the end of the code, to close the case.</p>
