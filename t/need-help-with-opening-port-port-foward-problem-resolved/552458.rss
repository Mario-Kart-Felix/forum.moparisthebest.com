    <description>Hello guys,
I previously tried to portforward an Rsps Port of 43594 to try to beta test it with my friends, but when i go and check
to see if the port was open on www.canyouseeme.org it said that there is a Connection TimeOut Error. I have tried many ways
to fix it, but it never seems to work so i was hoping one you fellows might be able help me resolve this problem.

When you went to test, did you make sure the server was online when you did?<br>

No i didnt[/quote]<br>
Try it again with the server online. Make sure the server has finished loading fully before testing.</p>
