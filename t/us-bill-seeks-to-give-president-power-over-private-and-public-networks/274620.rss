    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;But the provision that is attracting the most attention is buried deep in the 51-page bill, in a section blandly titled &quot;Cybersecurity Responsibility and Authority.&quot; It would give the president broad authority to directly intervene in security matters in both the public and private sectors. For starters, the bill would give the president the power to declare security emergencies and then curtail or shut down Internet traffic to and from any compromised federal or critical infrastructure networks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most important part ^

<p>Though I think it’d be a great fight, I really don’t see how the constitution can apply to something like the internet. I can see it is applicable from a certain point of view, but I really don’t think it can be done. The constitution enforces rights of American citizens, so the part that they have been denied a right can be argued, but nothing more. The constitution does not cover the actual network of users in private or public networks. The constitution is much more applicable for private networks than public networks, imo.[/quote]<br>
Governing the internet would be an act of extraterritoriality, which in turn will piss many off and would be unconstitutional (in America, duh).</p>

<p>Anyway, my brother’s coworker/boss came up with a ‘theory’ about this whole bill: Say someone is organizing a public riot with a group of people. The president will be able to say ‘this group of people are a threat to national security’.

<p>If the bill is passed, the Supreme Court can always check whether it is constitutional. If it isn’t, then they kill it. However, if it is not killed and the bill is used, someone (likely many people) may feel violated. They will then sue the United States and surely one of the cases will make it to the Supreme Court. The SC can then decide what to do with it then.</p>

<p>You having internet alone is not a network. A network is a collection of people. Giving the president the power to shutdown public and private networks would have devastating effects imo. Tbh, these politicians don’t understand the kinda damage they are going to do, because they really don’t understand the internet at all.<br>
[/quote]Sure they do.[/quote]</p>
<p>So you think that they know that if the internet is shutdown for one minute, many businesses will fail for that date, destroying stocks, trusts in currencies, and trust in online business, yet they are still so excited for such a ‘great bill’?</p>

<p>You having internet alone is not a network. A network is a collection of people. Giving the president the power to shutdown public and private networks would have devastating effects imo. Tbh, these politicians don’t understand the kinda damage they are going to do, because they really don’t understand the internet at all.</p>

<p>Of course it won’t only affect US users. There are many file hosts which hold servers in the US, many companies that hold servers in the US, and many transactions (money, product orders, etc) done to the US everyday. If any major country leaves the Internet web for one hour, the entire world will feel it (especially the US).</p>
