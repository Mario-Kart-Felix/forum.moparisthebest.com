    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/model-help-and-others-like-class-8/245016</link>
    <description>well i was wondering if i took a class8.java and all the other class&#39;s files and put them into my server would they work or is there a differnt way to do that. Also if this works do i have to add all the other models that are in this file... Another question when adding models after i say add model w/e with the drop wield and equip then what i have tried this several times and it still doesnt work... Also if the answer to the first question is no where do i get the files. Srry if i sound dumb asking all these questions but all help would be apreciated* srry about that spelling im not sure of it lol</description>

              <p>You can’t put the classes into your server, the items are all added on the client side, so you’d need to download your own client and add them in there, then if people wanted to use the items on your server they’s either need to download your client or you would need to ceate a webclient.</p>
