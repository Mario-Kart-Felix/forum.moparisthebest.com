    <description>[i][b]I have a source, and client set up for me... the IP is all correct and it&#39;s portforwarded (the canyouseeme.com website said it saw 43594). In RS-PS.com , it said that the server was up and gave me a link to play on. I go to the link and signed into the source, and it wouldn&#39;t work (error connecting to server). Please help me! I will Teamviewer or anything else that is necessary! Thanksss!!!!!
