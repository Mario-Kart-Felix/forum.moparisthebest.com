    <title>VPS Question</title>

    <description>Yes, the replies I am going to get will be very predictable 
&quot;Use google&quot;
&quot;Go to the website and ask!&quot;
And I understand you are still trying to help but, of course, I have tried that and could never get an answer to my SPECIFIC question.

My question is: I&#39;m a customer of www.vpsland.com and I just bought a windows VPS on November 18th 2009. My server has started to become populated towards the end. And I would like to renew my subscription, but when I use &quot;google&quot; or go to the &quot;website&quot; the answer leads to losing all the files I originally had.
Because so far, my VPS has WINRAR, Java, MY SOURCE (which is easily recoverable), and many other useful time consuming things. I just want to know how I can renew the subscription on the VPS I already have without losing my files and programs.</description>
