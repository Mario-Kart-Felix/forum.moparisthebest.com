    <title>Toyota Celica, few questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/toyota-celica-few-questions/462781</link>
    <description>I bought a Toyota Celica about 2 days ago, it&#39;s a very nice car, I like it. But I have a few questions about it, which I didn&#39;t find answers on from google.

The headlights seem to be really powerless. I can&#39;t see jackshit at nights. When it rains I have to pull over and wait till the rain is over so I can see something. I&#39;ve watched other cars headlights and they&#39;re much, much brighter, I want to know what I can do to fix the problem?

When I accelerate with high rpm, the car seems to tremble a lot, I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s normal or not.

How to know if the clutch is worn out? Currently the clutch grabs about 1-1,5cm from the default position.</description>
