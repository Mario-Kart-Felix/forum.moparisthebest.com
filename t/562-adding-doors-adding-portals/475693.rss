    <description>It seems some people are having trouble adding doors in a 562.
[b][size=21pt]Step one[/size][/b]
Go to object1packethandler.java and search with crl+f and search case 19205 or case 19337
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[b][size=21pt]Step Two[/size][/b]
Replace the case 19205 with the the door object you. for example when u click a unadded door it will say. Object (id) (x) (y) the object id is the what you want to replace 19205 so if my door id was 44211 i would do Case 44221.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[b][size=21pt]Step Three[/size][/b] 
And under the case 19205 you might see somthing simaller
player.WalkTo().GoTo(player, x, y-1);
break;
[b][size=21pt]Step Five[/size][/b] 
and under WalkTo(.GoTo(player, x, y-1);
paste this player.tele(2826, 3859, 0); under that. and those 2826 3859 is where you want the door to take you so if u just want it to go in another room just put the door coords 1 space after. so if im behind the door make your self noclip or teleport 1 space after the door you want and put the coords. in 2826, 3958, 0;
[b][size=21pt]Step Six[/size][/b] 
but if u can&#39;t get out of the room spawn an object and make it teleport you out of the door and do the same thing with the case below 19205 so if it was a chest i would do case 170 and make it teleport me 1 space after the door. same steps just do the same steps. also u can do the same with the object id of a portal to make u teleport somewhere.
Thanks
