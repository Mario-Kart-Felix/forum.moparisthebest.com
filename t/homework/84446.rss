    <title>Homework</title>

    <description>Homework (eww...?)  How much is enough?  Some argue that homework helps cut time off useless activities such as playing computer games and watching noneducational TV, and allows us to do some review of the things we learned in school.  Great...if you are in elementary school.  But in high school, things are different, especially if you join IB or AP.  Then the homework load gets piled up...and the same argument can no longer be used.  There comes a point when so much homework is given that not only can the student not to ANYTHING fun, but they start taking time off sleep.  Now, if this is so educational, how well do you think we learn if we stay up every night doing homework until 1:00am?  Experts say, not too well.  And what about other stuff?  Maybe we want to work, volunteer, learn about things that are actually useful (who needs to know that there are 17 protons in a Chlorine atom?), etc.  I&#39;m not ranting because I have a lot of homework and I hate it and I&#39;m not learning anything from it, but because I want to see how you guys view...homework.</description>

              <p>I never used to do homework until my gay school forced a rule upon us saying that if we didn’t do our homework, we have to do it after school with the princifag and hear him bitch about it. Thats why I do my homework now… And imo, homework is pointless because you spend 6-8 hours (depends on who you are) learning in school and when you go home you just want to relax and when you do homework, your probably not concentrating so your not learning. If homework was FUN I would do it, but its not and thats why people hate it. For example, would you do your homework for an AP Java class if you had to code a RuneScape server within a month? Yes! Why? BECAUSE ITS FUN! I rest my case.</p>
