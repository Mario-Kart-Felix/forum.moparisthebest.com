    <title>Writing a new quest. (Hiring for help!)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/writing-a-new-quest-hiring-for-help/172084</link>
    <description>[left]Ok Mopar users,

                      We&#39;ve finally gotten our feet off the ground, and we need a quest to keep our questers happy!
We&#39;ll always hire new people (unless we get too many) to help us with our quests.

Quest Name: [b]~Seek of Saradomin~[/b]

Quest story line...

    [b] A young man, in search for the love of his life
     needs some help finding this mystic &quot;she&quot;.
     What he doesn&#39;t know, is that he will
     be searching for something a little more
     than just a girl. Will he find his true love?
     Or fall in the process? Along the line, he
     seeks guidence in the lord; Saradomin.
     This seems to be one of the most challenging
     quests ever existing...[/b]

This is up to the coders we hire. If you want a permanent job, please make sure you have good coding skills. PM me for a permanent or temporary job![/left]</description>
