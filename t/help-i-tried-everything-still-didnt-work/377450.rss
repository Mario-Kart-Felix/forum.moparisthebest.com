    <title>Help ++ i tried everything, still didn&#39;t work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-i-tried-everything-still-didnt-work/377450</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Error with player 1, Mark
java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 100
        at client.CreateProjectile(client.java:
        at client.rangeGFXNPC(client.java:3054)
        at client.process(client.java:18999)
        at PlayerHandler.process(PlayerHandler.
        at process.run(process.java:23)
        at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is my range error, i am using delta and everytime I range it shoots the arrow but doesn&#39;t show the hitmark, this is wierd because I dont think I edited any of the range.
I also didn&#39;t edit anything in the client.
Someone told me it was about the array, I&#39;m not a beginner but not a pro so please can someone explain or tell me how i can possibly resolve the problem?</description>
