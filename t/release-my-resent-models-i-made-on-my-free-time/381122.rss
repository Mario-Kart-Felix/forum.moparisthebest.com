    <description> :D :D my models i have been working on for last 3 hours 30 mins on and off(small time and yet so much done)
i have to use renders because my &quot;prtsc,sysrq&quot; button broke so i have to use renders sorry
but anyways heres what i have :)

sorry about the size of the pictures idk how to make em smaller on tinypic so it will have to b huge sorry to say anyways heres what i have 
VVVVVVVV

V

1st model 
name: &#39;custom rs cannon v2&#39; or simply &#39;Dwarf Multi-Cannon#2&#39;
this is a model made 100% of prims and mesh smoothing
 pictures as following

[IMG]http://i54.tinypic.com/25k4whv.png[/img]

but it is mega-mega-mega poly overkill so i didnt add wireframe but i did just now but its over because i did it for the very smooth shape and curve indents in the base (furnace) and the bump in the end of the barrel  and also added cannonball auto-reload :P

model #2
name: &#39;!$@%!%% ouch! @#@!!@$&#39; ( you will find out)
this took me 5 mins but turned out really great its not rushed but was fairly simple to do

pictures as followed (hide your eyes and scroll up or down if your scared of needles like me x.x...)

<p>Topic: What is that thing at the top of the first model? It’s got squiggly lines on it.[/quote]<br>
it was a area thet had “cannon V 2011” on it but it made the lketters small when i used the material but it was too round to add the traced immage of it since i did mesh smoothing or something X4 making it that shape but added other effects (also making it poly mega overkill but i still like it i acually might remove that when i feel like editting it :S[quote=“amy_webb, post:14, topic:381122”]Maybe if you make the pushy thinggy more longer maybe something like this?</p>

that is acually a good point but i was just bored at the time so i made these from nowhere <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> altho im not a “master” of it but i still like to fiddle around with it on my free time<br>
@ all others: i still like what u sayed and i will try to make my models better in the future but i need to do more effort since i saw your guy’s\girl’s (what ever gender you are) are alot more effort then this so thanks for your thoughts<br>
i might close this is u people want me to im just glad to see you people gave me advice and cc and some things that encourage me to do harder so anyways tyvm</p>

<p>:edit:<br>
also added wireframes for both of them</p>
<p>and it is just for fun like the title says i made em on my freetime and i hated how the 317 cannon looked so i made the cannon thinking some1 could use it if they removed the cannonball being shot out  and the needle some1 can use and make a drop model and use as some see inject morphane or something like tht i saw on another server <em>trys best not to say name</em> and i thought this would work pretty well but again its just some random things that go in my head</p>
<p>cannon took me 2 hours 45 mins on and off and the needle to get everything right was about 1/2 hour or so on and off</p>
<p>so ya u can use em if u want i just like it if you would see this at least i wouldnt care if u hated it loved it it doesnt matter to me (if u liked it it would be different)</p>

<p>Yeah I know, and for the ‘Against’ part, I think it’s OK to use it for SOME things, but for this it doesn’t render very well.</p>

<p>but it is mega-mega-mega poly overkill so i didnt add wireframe but i did just now but its over because i did it for the very smooth shape and curve indents in the base (furnace) and the bump in the end of the barrel  and also added cannonball auto-reload <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
