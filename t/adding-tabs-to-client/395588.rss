    <description>I&#39;m looking to add a donator tab to my client. It&#39;s a basic PI client. I&#39;m looking for someone to point me in the right direction and maybe something might come your way.</description>

<p>What exactly do you mean “donator tab”? If you mean like a JTabbedPane, then all you would have to do is switch the Frame or JFrame in Frame_Sub1 to a JPanel, and then whenever you add a new tab, it creates a new instance of the client. However, there would be performance issues, as it would load all the items, objects, npcs, interfaces, animations, etc again each time a new tab is opened. In a case like that, I would suggest you just load all the definitions when the client starts, and then basically just draw the game area in each new tab.</p>
<p>If you mean like a game tab (skills, quests, etc) then you would have to change the gameframe, add some “if mouseX and mouseY are within blah” tweak it as necessary.</p>
<p>I should really get back started on my Interface library =[/quote]<br>
Yes adding a tab in-game. I’m adding a Donator tab with info and other things.</p>
