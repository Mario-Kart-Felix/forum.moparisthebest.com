    <title>Coke Music Filters - Working With WPE</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/coke-music-filters-working-with-wpe/5348</link>
    <description>[center]WPE = Windows Packet Editor[/center]

The tutorial isnt complete as I ran into computer problems when I was nearing the end, so it may be completed sometime in the future, but really, if you can understand until the end, then you should have an excellent idea on where to go from there.

it is client side but theres little "loop holes" that effect real gameplay. im 99% sure on that, but if someone dissagrees then please post!

              <p>pimp pimp, the dll aslways shows up as a virus an deletes it i get pissed.  you should upload some new filters.</p>
<p>all the stuff is client side but you can use it to your advantage and change real stuff in the game if you know what your doing.  like changing the hightmap made you be able to put stuff in the wall.</p>
<p>edit: i remember when cokemusic used to be good, then they tryd to make it unhackable by dubbuling up the hex and now its lagy as shit.</p>
<p>edit2:i just logged on it and my guy is uber haxed he has random colours and stuff i ferget how i did that.</p>
