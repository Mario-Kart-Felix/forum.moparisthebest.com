    <title>What to change?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-to-change/199969</link>
    <description>I have been working on this image all day and i seem to like it for the most part, but it seems that there is something wrong with it...
[img]http://img166.imageshack.us/img166/1201/new2cs3.jpg[/img]
I think it may need a bit of work in some places, but i cant see where.
If someone could please give me their opinion on it and what they think i should change.
EDIT: It would REALLY be appreciated if someone suggested a font for me.
Thanks</description>

              <p>The color of the signature needs a bit of work. It’s really just my opinion but these colors don’t contrast very well. Causing the  darker colors to stand out almost immediately. Helping you in your case. Because the dark colors reveal the car. There isn’t really anything you can do with the colors now to make it look better. A different color palette might would. Something more dark.</p>
<p>I like darker images. They seem to make even the most subtle intricate details just burst with color. The White light in the top right corner is above the border. You might should fix that. The Rims on the car are a bit jagged and look smudged (Not in a good way.). I would also fix the front of the car. Maybe make the grill more visible, and making it dark, in contrast to the rest of the signature, making the black shadow on the hood seem like it fits in place.</p>
<p>Adding a grill would fix many of the problems I believe. Other than the color choice. You might should think about toning down the pink, to a more violet or maroon color. That would blend a bit better with the aqua in the car. As for the text, you might should look into getting some Japanese text, and putting one or two characters on either side of your name, changing your name to something of a techno, LCD font. Or something bold, and Graffiti like.</p>

              <p>I for one quite like it. I really like the choice of colours used too. I will sort of edit in paint to show you where I think you need to do something different;<br>
<img src="http://i125.photobucket.com/albums/p80/davidude36/carrr.jpg" alt width="389" height="125"><br>
I also think there is something about the font which is not so appealing to the car. Maybe find one that matches the cars spray paints? Also try to move the text so it is parralel to the car, this is also what I think you might try with the other cars you have done at <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,264338.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,264338.0.html</a>.</p>
<p>I really love the colours for it though, as mentioned by xxlegitxx I think the white spot where the text is needs to more “encapsulate” the text so the text doesnt sort of look off-center with it.</p>
<p>I’m thinking you need to not have a white patch where the text is, perhaps a lighter purple there, but still have a darker purple surrounding it.</p>
<p>All in all so far I’d give it a good 8/10.</p>
<p>P.S. I’d like to say this is my sort of first ever proper critosism, and I’d like to remind people I have absolutely no experience with Graphic Arts.</p>
