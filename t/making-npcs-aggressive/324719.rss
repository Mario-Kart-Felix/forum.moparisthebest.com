    <title>Making NPCs Aggressive?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-npcs-aggressive/324719</link>
    <description>I was wondering how to make NPCs aggressive... I&#39;ve tried NPCHandler.java, that didn&#39;t work. (Although I did make all the dragons breathe fire. Lol.)
I couldn&#39;t find how to do this. The only thing I found was in the NPCHandler.java, but like I said above, it didn&#39;t work.
If you know how could you explain, or possibly give me a link to the thread...
Thanks.</description>
