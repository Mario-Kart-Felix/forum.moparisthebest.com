    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-khalphite-queen/339740</link>
    <description>I wanted to add Kalphite Queen..
I started doing this..
Putted a tunnel on my server..
Tunnel is standing 100%, when I climb down you have to run till the end of the tunnel...
And at the end of the tunnel there is another climb down thing to go to kq

Now Is my problem...
When I climb down at the end of the tunnel I start at the beginning again..
Can someone help me to make me climb down to kq herself? (:

Thanx a lot !!</description>

              <p>You prob have the same object at the end so it just teleports you to the beginning.<br>
Try adding a new object to teleport you to KQ hive</p>
