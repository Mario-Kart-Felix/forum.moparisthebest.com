    <title>Client Cannot Connect to Server... Port Issue?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-cannot-connect-to-server-port-issue/448239</link>
    <description>Server and client in question: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,549881.0.html ([PI] Rune-World)

First thing&#39;s first - my subdomain is pointed correctly, my port (43594) is open and forwarded to the correct local IP, and the antileeches in the server source are corrected.

Now, when I start the server it says &quot;Server listening on port 0.0.0.0:43594&quot;. Problem is, I think it&#39;s lying to me. A simple netstat command showed me that it&#39;s running on whatever port it wants to. (See screenshot).

If I attempt to connect to the server via client either by 127.0.0.1, the subdomain pointed to the server ip, or my global ip, it of course gives the &quot;Error connecting to server&quot; message.

Because I believe this is a server side issue, I&#39;ll be willing to share the source to people who have exhibited prior knowledge in Java developing, and do have a brain. PM me for the source - I don&#39;t want to give it out publicly antileech free.

Or, you can go to the link I provided and fix the antileech yourself. Your call if you want to help.

If anybody has a hunch or a fix regarding this issue, go ahead and post. This has been stumping me for a while.

Note: The two netstat instances were taken during different server startups.
