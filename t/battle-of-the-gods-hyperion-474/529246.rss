    <title>Battle Of The Gods - Hyperion 474</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/battle-of-the-gods-hyperion-474/529246</link>
    <description>Hello and welcome to my development thread. I plan on this being a very long term project. I might open for beta testing when I actually have a lot of content. I am a pretty basic programmer. I don&#39;t know all that much, and continue learning. I did Hyperion mainly to learn good habits, it has good stability, and overall I just think it is the nicest. You will probably see that I ask for help in the help section from time to time, but hey that&#39;s what it is there for. Anyways I hope you all will enjoy what I add and what I would like to do, and I hope you will support me. Thanks.

So my main idea with &quot;Battle Of The Gods&quot; is when you start you choose a side, Saradomin or Zamorak. Whatever side you choose will effect your game play. You will have specific quests for the side you choose, specific armor, and etc. You will also have the mainland like Lumbridge and Varrock to be in. I do want to implement a new skill which would be a form of enchantment. For example if you enchant a Saradomin platebody, it will give you higher defense bonus&#39;s. If you enchant a Zamorak platebody you will get high attack bonus&#39;s, and finally enchanting a Guthix platebody will give you both, but half the bonuses. This idea may not go through as planned because I might come up with something else as I go on and I could possibly change it.

The main focus for now will be updating all the skills and functions needed to have some enjoyment lol. I will get working on my idea after I do some necessities.

I forgot the source I am using, but it is pretty much clean. An example would be I didn&#39;t have a working logout button :D.
I will be updating the thread as I go along with media and progress. I hope you all enjoy and I hope to grow from this.

<p>Thank you :), and I hope you continue to work on it. I might have a change in ideas. After all it’s not like I own the idea :p. Plus you would also get way farther with it than I could.</p>
