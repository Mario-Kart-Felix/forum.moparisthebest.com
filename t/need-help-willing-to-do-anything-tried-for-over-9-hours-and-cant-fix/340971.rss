              <p>First of all download the tool that Palidino <span class="bbcode-b">provided</span> for this.<br>
<a href="http://uppit.com/v/7N3HONLP" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://uppit.com/v/7N3HONLP</a></p>
<p>and undo all the things people told you to do on here.</p>
<p>make sure you extract it.</p>
<p>Go into the Images folder<br>
(Image_Packer\Images)</p>
<p>replace “background_0” with yours, make sure it’s in .png format.</p>
<p>go back to the main directory<br>
(Image_packer)</p>
<p>Hit pack.</p>
<p>replace the Images.dat with the one in your battlescape client cache.</p>
<p>and there you go.</p>
<p>if that doesn’t work then your a complete retard. i just did it to the spare BS client i have around.</p>

              <p>/* “background_0” */ didn’t work. It compiled. But then the image was still there. I noticed that there were several background images so I took the liberty of commenting all of them out. The client loaded up, everything works perfectly, EXCEPT one thing…</p>
<p>The background was replaced with a steelborder image… So in the top left corner, its a little white box with borders around it, the borders form a backwards ‘L’.</p>
<p>I tried toms suite, pali’s image packer, EVERYTHING. If someone gets this to work, I will be there personal programmer for life. And yes…I am a programmer, I don’t do little kid shit that people think is programming (e.g. rsps ‘coding’). I don’t ‘code’ rsps sources. I make them, I design them. I know Java BEYOND game programming. So yes, I will be of great help to you if you figure this little sprite problem for me.</p>
<p>You’re probably wondering, “well, since you know java so well, why cant you fix it smart one!”</p>
<p>that’s because the Images.dat file isn’t written in java, it’s a different type of hexadecimal location and structure. A .DAT image UNpacker is all I need. I googled for one, and all the one’s i found are useless.</p>
<p>Anyone up for the challenge?</p>
