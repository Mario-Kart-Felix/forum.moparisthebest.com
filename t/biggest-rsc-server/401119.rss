    <title>Biggest RSC Server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/biggest-rsc-server/401119</link>
    <description>What&#39;s the biggest RSC server, that&#39;s been up the longest, and is looking to stay up even longer? I&#39;m playing RSCEmulation, but, the community is full of douchebaggery. With only about 100ish people on daily, if you guys could help me/redirect me to a more active RSC server, with maybe 200 + 300 active people, and a nice friendly community. Please do so.</description>

You think its a coincidence that a player on your server said that rscr was better than rscr started getting ddosed after getting banned?<br>
Sounds like a total coincidence to me.</p>

<p>For what it’s worth, on RSC there wasn’t private servers, everyone was forced to play if they wanted to play RSC, regardless if they thought the rates were too slow or drops were too hard to achieve.</p>
<p>On RSC private servers, they’ve played numerous servers with fast rates, slow rates and every other combination you can think of. If they disagree with that particular servers rates or how it’s run they simply don’t play. That means that there’s 100-250 players online RSCEmulation at any given time but probably hundreds of other people who disagree with how it’s run just waiting for something else.</p>
<p>However, half of them would probably like an exact, identical RSC replica, the other half would prefer faster rates… I tried to go in the middle with a medium XP rate but people still think it’s either way too fast or way too slow and don’t bother playing. Private servers have given players a choice and an opinion basically. There will never be one central server because not everyone agrees with how it should be run.</p>
<p>I’ve provided RSCE for nearly 2 years now yet still some people would prefer a new server to come out with no proven history, no guarantee that it will be up for longer than a month and so on… As I said before if people really cared about the community they would go for a centralized server but that’s not the case. I think for most people it’s just the excitement of something new, the drama of it collapsing/being hacked and what not.</p>
<p>CodeForFame has said numerous times that he would never work using a RSCD based source, which is why he started working on RSCBase (but never finished it), but here’s an opportunity of a bit of power/reputation and he’s bang on it… It’s also amusing at how everyone seems to approve of this even though every server he’s worked on he’s exploited in one way or another, giving himself billions on Project P2P for example… It would be so easy to slip a line of code in somewhere that no-one would ever notice to give yourself a huge advantage, regardless whether it’s open source or not.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s funny, because I started working on this, and just the other day I found myself complaining about RSCD.  At this point the server is pretty much done, so I can start working on an alternative.  Also, there is only one reason why I started, and that’s because I thought other people would actually be working on it.  At this point it’s clear that no one is going to work on it until it’s up and running, and even then I’m not too optimistic…</p>
<p>As for exploiting server, don’t even go there, you’re making it out to be a completely selfish act, when that’s not even close to reality.  Anyway, the whole project is open source, do you really think I’d have be stupid enough to try and slip one past, especially when they can see the commit history, and I’m waiting at least 24 hours before I accept my own pull requests?<br>

<p>As for exploiting server, don’t even go there, you’re making it out to be a completely selfish act, when that’s not even close to reality.  Anyway, the whole project is open source, do you really think I’d have be stupid enough to try and slip one past, especially when they can see the commit history, and I’m waiting at least 24 hours before I accept my own pull requests?<br>

Isn’t that 1 of the main goals when you start a business? Take out all of the other competition any way possible…</p>

<p>Biggest server? RSCE.<br>

</aside>
<p>What’s the best server then? RscReloaded or Classic PK?</p>
<p>And the majority seem to disagree with you. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>For what it’s worth, on RSC there wasn’t private servers, everyone was forced to play if they wanted to play RSC, regardless if they thought the rates were too slow or drops were too hard to achieve.</p>
<p>On RSC private servers, they’ve played numerous servers with fast rates, slow rates and every other combination you can think of. If they disagree with that particular servers rates or how it’s run they simply don’t play. That means that there’s 100-250 players online RSCEmulation at any given time but probably hundreds of other people who disagree with how it’s run just waiting for something else.</p>
<p>However, half of them would probably like an exact, identical RSC replica, the other half would prefer faster rates… I tried to go in the middle with a medium XP rate but people still think it’s either way too fast or way too slow and don’t bother playing. Private servers have given players a choice and an opinion basically. There will never be one central server because not everyone agrees with how it should be run.</p>
<p>I’ve provided RSCE for nearly 2 years now yet still some people would prefer a new server to come out with no proven history, no guarantee that it will be up for longer than a month and so on… As I said before if people really cared about the community they would go for a centralized server but that’s not the case. I think for most people it’s just the excitement of something new, the drama of it collapsing/being hacked and what not.</p>
<p>CodeForFame has said numerous times that he would never work using a RSCD based source, which is why he started working on RSCBase (but never finished it), but here’s an opportunity of a bit of power/reputation and he’s bang on it… It’s also amusing at how everyone seems to approve of this even though every server he’s worked on he’s exploited in one way or another, giving himself billions on Project P2P for example… It would be so easy to slip a line of code in somewhere that no-one would ever notice to give yourself a huge advantage, regardless whether it’s open source or not.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s funny, because I started working on this, and just the other day I found myself complaining about RSCD.  At this point the server is pretty much done, so I can start working on an alternative.  Also, there is only one reason why I started, and that’s because I thought other people would actually be working on it.  At this point it’s clear that no one is going to work on it until it’s up and running, and even then I’m not too optimistic…</p>
<p>As for exploiting server, don’t even go there, you’re making it out to be a completely selfish act, when that’s not even close to reality.  Anyway, the whole project is open source, do you really think I’d have be stupid enough to try and slip one past, especially when they can see the commit history, and I’m waiting at least 24 hours before I accept my own pull requests?[/quote]Once again.<br>
