<p>For what it‚Äôs worth, on RSC there wasn‚Äôt private servers, everyone was forced to play if they wanted to play RSC, regardless if they thought the rates were too slow or drops were too hard to achieve.</p>
<p>On RSC private servers, they‚Äôve played numerous servers with fast rates, slow rates and every other combination you can think of. If they disagree with that particular servers rates or how it‚Äôs run they simply don‚Äôt play. That means that there‚Äôs 100-250 players online RSCEmulation at any given time but probably hundreds of other people who disagree with how it‚Äôs run just waiting for something else.</p>
<p>However, half of them would probably like an exact, identical RSC replica, the other half would prefer faster rates‚Ä¶ I tried to go in the middle with a medium XP rate but people still think it‚Äôs either way too fast or way too slow and don‚Äôt bother playing. Private servers have given players a choice and an opinion basically. There will never be one central server because not everyone agrees with how it should be run.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve provided RSCE for nearly 2 years now yet still some people would prefer a new server to come out with no proven history, no guarantee that it will be up for longer than a month and so on‚Ä¶ As I said before if people really cared about the community they would go for a centralized server but that‚Äôs not the case. I think for most people it‚Äôs just the excitement of something new, the drama of it collapsing/being hacked and what not.</p>
<p>CodeForFame has said numerous times that he would never work using a RSCD based source, which is why he started working on RSCBase (but never finished it), but here‚Äôs an opportunity of a bit of power/reputation and he‚Äôs bang on it‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs also amusing at how everyone seems to approve of this even though every server he‚Äôs worked on he‚Äôs exploited in one way or another, giving himself billions on Project P2P for example‚Ä¶ It would be so easy to slip a line of code in somewhere that no-one would ever notice to give yourself a huge advantage, regardless whether it‚Äôs open source or not.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs funny, because I started working on this, and just the other day I found myself complaining about RSCD.

<p>As for exploiting server, don‚Äôt even go there, you‚Äôre making it out to be a completely selfish act, when that‚Äôs not even close to reality.

<p>Biggest server? RSCE.<br>
RSCE the best server? no.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>What‚Äôs the best server then? RscReloaded or Classic PK?</p>
<p>And the majority seem to disagree with you. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>For what it‚Äôs worth, on RSC there wasn‚Äôt private servers, everyone was forced to play if they wanted to play RSC, regardless if they thought the rates were too slow or drops were too hard to achieve.</p>
<p>On RSC private servers, they‚Äôve played numerous servers with fast rates, slow rates and every other combination you can think of. If they disagree with that particular servers rates or how it‚Äôs run they simply don‚Äôt play. That means that there‚Äôs 100-250 players online RSCEmulation at any given time but probably hundreds of other people who disagree with how it‚Äôs run just waiting for something else.</p>
<p>However, half of them would probably like an exact, identical RSC replica, the other half would prefer faster rates‚Ä¶ I tried to go in the middle with a medium XP rate but people still think it‚Äôs either way too fast or way too slow and don‚Äôt bother playing. Private servers have given players a choice and an opinion basically. There will never be one central server because not everyone agrees with how it should be run.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve provided RSCE for nearly 2 years now yet still some people would prefer a new server to come out with no proven history, no guarantee that it will be up for longer than a month and so on‚Ä¶ As I said before if people really cared about the community they would go for a centralized server but that‚Äôs not the case. I think for most people it‚Äôs just the excitement of something new, the drama of it collapsing/being hacked and what not.</p>
<p>CodeForFame has said numerous times that he would never work using a RSCD based source, which is why he started working on RSCBase (but never finished it), but here‚Äôs an opportunity of a bit of power/reputation and he‚Äôs bang on it‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs also amusing at how everyone seems to approve of this even though every server he‚Äôs worked on he‚Äôs exploited in one way or another, giving himself billions on Project P2P for example‚Ä¶ It would be so easy to slip a line of code in somewhere that no-one would ever notice to give yourself a huge advantage, regardless whether it‚Äôs open source or not.</p>

        <p>right now rsce is the best bc its the biggest. no one wants to play a server that has 10-20 people on it. having said that i hope that ‚Äúthey‚Äù make a server that Has everything the same as thee orginal runescape classic, which rscAngel was the private server that seem to do that.  i personally have been waiting and waiting for a server like angel to come back out, but i have yet to see it.  if this such server did come out, it, would be the best.<br>
Does anyone know of anything going on behind the scenes ?<br>
