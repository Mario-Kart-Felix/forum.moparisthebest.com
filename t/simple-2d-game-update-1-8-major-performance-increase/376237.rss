    <title>Simple 2D Game [Update 1.8] Major performance increase!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/simple-2d-game-update-1-8-major-performance-increase/376237</link>
    <description>I got bored, and decided I wanted to start figuring out exactly the basics of a 2D &quot;engine&quot; (if you wanna even call it that), so I did a bit of research and made a small game out of it all. Took me a bit to get collisions right, but its working :)

Pic: (lol i sucked)

DL:
(1.8)
http://uppit.com/ci8426j67cdi/Game.rar

(1.7_3)
http://uppit.com/znay0p499tlt/Game.rar

(1.7_1)
http://up.ht/gcoTH2

Goal:
Keep away from the &quot;evil&quot; [s]red[/s] (in 1.5 update, i introduced 2 new squares) squares for as long as you can, I am adding more features as I go, I am working on some kind of scoring right now.

Controls:
Use the arrow keys or ASDW keys to move.

Features:
[ul][li]3 Different chasers, each with a different speed (added randomly)[/li]
[li]A &#39;Power Up&quot;, appears up to 12 points away (technicalled up to 12.5 points away) from your current score. Currently, the only power-up is a &quot;freeze&quot; for the chasers (randomly set between 1 and 1000 frames, or in point translation, 0-10 points)[/li]
[li]Chasers spawn randomly in area (same wth power up), and never in the same quarter as you (although there are minor positioning bugs I need to fix for the area&#39;s)[/li]
[li]Plenty of play-time and addicting minutes lol.[/li]
[li]Press &#39;F2&#39; to save a quick-screenshot.[/li]
[li]Added a highscore (later will make website containing world-wide scores.[/li][/ul]


Changelog (started at 1.7_03, sorry):
[b]1.8[/b]
[ul][li]Now only 1 power allowed at a time (performance enhancement, as typically you should have gotten that one before a new one should spawn)[/li]
[li]Chasers now run off of an ArrayList instead of a set limit of 400 of them (was 2k originally, but lowered to 400 in 1.7_03 for performance, and now re-wrote) This was the major performance increase, as it is alot easier on the CPU and JVM to sort inside of an ArrayList rather than 400 things, and checking if the are null or not. (although not all dead code was removed, it has increased the performance alot, i will do a MAJOR stress test and see if I can get it to lag on my i7)[/li][/ul]


[b]1.7_03[/b]
[ul][li]A bit less troublesome on the cpu load (managed to have over well over 2k[when i stopped it] chasers without lag) [i know this is sad, but it was laggy before around 500][/li]
[li]Chasers still had a bug on spawning, and spawned in TL region, that is fixed, and they now spawn in any region you currently do not reside in[/li]
[li]Removed clipping for chasers (not needed, since there is nothing to be dodged, they only had wall-clipping, and it was pointless)[/li][/ul]


So far, at the current 1.7-Stage, my best score is a 36, whats yours?</description>

              <p>This was a pretty fun game. Got a highscore of 12. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Anyway, I am going to challenge you to rewrite this game and try using the Slick library for it, rather than Java2D. It might take some time, but you’re going to be amazed at what a performance difference Slick will make, and you will be impressed with how well your code is going to look after you rewrite it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Also, I would recommend you maybe add more comments so we can understand what your code is intended to do, but that’s ultimately up to. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>Lol in my eyes it was a mistake.  Ive implemented more optimization into the version on my computer but it only made a total difference of about 5% performance increase. The fact I had changed Chaser into an ArrayList did the largest difference.  Have any suggestions for a feature?</p>

<p>If I deem any of my current ideas worthy I may work on a concept and such but it may be a while before anything gets done.  Been buying black market arts for my 95 suzuki gsx600f.  Lets just say ive been having more fun off the computer these days lol.</p>

<p>Also, nice game, but I wouldn’t waste my time on it if I was you, you should start another project because you got the potential, a more serious project.</p>
<p>Think about a game, design it, make the mechanics then start coding it, and make it online if you have the possibilities. Not only will you get recognized if you make it good, you can make some money with it 2 by doing ads.</p>

              <p>Alright, 1.8 is release and is officially marked as the final version (unless a good suggestion is made). I have made some major re-writes to this, (i learned alot while I am in the process of making my Gladiator style game, and made some MAJOR performance improvements here. I have officially gotten 7754 chasers before lag (i know this is bad at a low amount, but this was with my i7’s overclocking ability disabled, so it was running at a measly 1.7GHz (It can overclock to a max of 3.2GHz). I had no memory issues with this, only the very very low amount of noticeable lag. I am proud of this update, and I hope it will bring some peace that I am not as stupid as I look. (lulz)</p>
<p>Anyways, I hope this will be something everybody can learn from. Never set a class as its own array, use an arraylist lmfao. Much easier to handle, <span class="bbcode-b">and</span> less of a load on your computer.</p>

Would not be too hard, just the issue of getting the coordinates for them, other than that, just write a simple boolean that would check the movement <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>The problem of them spawning like they do, is I have not corrected the demensions for the spawning yet. I just threw in some numbers that sounded good. I will do that now though. As for them spawning right on you, try to stay away from the center too much (thats generally where it happens for me), as remember, the do spawn in a location, but if you are RIGHT on the boarder, for example, your X and Y are like, 256, and 250. The chaser spawns at 256, and 240. Sure, it wasn’t in the same section (the 250 is example dividing point), but because he is 32x32, he still touches you. I will work on off-set spawning later. At least, when I can optimize some of the code, and separate this into more class’s.</p>

INI file? What are them? But a difficulty level sounds alright, but like Pac-Man, you start off easy and he game gradually gets harder.[/quote]<br>
INI file is just another extension, kinda like a TXT file, but these are generally used for settings and such.</p>
<p>I would need to make a new class or something to handle the difficulty as it goes along or something, but I guess I will look into both options. I’ll make 2 versions (one with set difficulty, and another that gets harder and harder), and see what everybody likes.</p>
