    <title>The perfect server (317)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-perfect-server-317/535731</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;m just wondering what people consider to be their perfect server content wise. Forget about things like respectful and mature staff, no lagging, constant uptime, etc, because we all know they are important.
I am wanting to know peoples descriptions of their perfect 317 Runescape Private Server. I want to know what kind of server you guys would invest a lot of your time and effort into. Something completely unique with original features? If so, what kind of features? And in what ways would you want it to be unique? Or would you prefer an accurate remake of Runescape around the 2006-2007 era? If so, what differences would you like to see if any?
I am looking forward to hearing your responses!</description>

<ol>
<li>Huge variety of customization.</li>
<li>Great data and no glitches.</li>
<li>No customs, no big caches, no 10000 sprites. Clean looking, professional cache.</li>
<li>Great looking code for future maintenance reasons.</li>

To me a flawless server is one that is managed correctly, you can have skills like woodcutting that have all the trees in one place with a fast multiplier yet if it isn’t glitchy and you don’t have the game lagging with a shit ton of ddos attacks then you’re doing it right in my eyes.

<p>Make a clean, smooth, professionally run server and devote your time to it. There’s nothing worse than having 13 year old moderators who are representing the servers staff, constantly abusing their powers and acting like they own the place. Keep it professional, I can’t stress that enough. Making a server for monetary gain isn’t a bad thing, but you must run it as a business. If you half ass it and don’t feel dedicated to the project then don’t run it for money.</p>

<p>Thank you for the input! I actually also ran a very successful server back in 2008 and the community was very professionally run. Being a more mature aged member of the forums I don’t really want people running my server (moderators) who aren’t fair and professional, which usually (but not always) comes with age. I feel that I am fairly knowledgable in running a professional server considering in my past servers, I do not allow anyone to spawn items, not even myself. I don’t allow people to purchase items or anything that will give them a huge advantage over players who can’t afford to pay. I treat moderators as having a job, and not a privilege. Obviously a bug free and well performing server (even under attacks) is a given. As is good website. And I completely agree with everything you say.</p>

<p>You don’t think so? I actually believe to an extent to make a server enjoyable and make players stay long instead of a few weeks before it gets boring, it is very much to do with the content in the server. Whether that be XP rates, minigames to keep players occupied, tasks that can be done where players both work together and verse one another (such as dungeons, and duel arena). Obviously an optimal server will include mature and fair staff who make the right decisions in all aspects. Good performance, good website integration and everything like that. That is fairly straightforward. But in regards to content, that is what keeps the player entertained and makes them stay online for longer. But yes I do see your point. There are more important aspects to content, but since I feel I know what makes a professionally run server, I am talking specifically about what would entertain people in regards to content.</p>

<p>The perfect server is a balance between the product released and the way the community is handled, you can have a really good product but have a crappy community backing it which means you will most likely gain very few new customers. On the other hand you could have an awful product and have a great community who helps supports others but the product is still bad so you won’t get as many players.</p>

              <p>If you compile all of my posts in this thread into one big blurb of a summary, you’ll understand what I look for in a server that I will stick with in the long run. All of these posts have been from what I like to see personally. I don’t look for something specific when I join a server, I just look for the above mentioned.<br>
EDIT: I should add that I always enjoy seeing ‘easter eggs’ in a server, such as allusions to popular movies, books, etc.<br>
EDIT2: Also, try to get your community involved in a long-term project, such as an “Embattled Wiki.” Host it on your on website using software such as <a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">DokuWiki</a>.</p>

All very good points my friend. By all means continue. As for the server, I am planning on continuing the Embattled development, but I have just been wondering whether an extremely unique server is what people are after nowadays.<br>

Uniqueness is always a good thing to have. Just make sure that there is relation to the original game. When the game is entirely unique, it scares away some potential members. For example, include effects and abilities in things such as PVP and PVM but don’t stray so far as to make fighting revolve solely around abilities, but if you want to provide the option alongside normal weapons then go for it. RuneScape was initially going the right direction with abilities, but now with the new combat setup I was driven away.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah I understand exactly what you mean. In that case I’m hoping to continue the development after my final exams at university (a couple of weeks), and hopefully get a satisfactory server for people to give feedback on. Then I can ensure the balance between Runescape and unique is perfect.</p>
<p>Anyway, I still would like to hear what yourself and other community members would love to see in their dream server.</p>

EDIT: This doesn’t mean to not provide areas and scenarios when you can use abilities and effects all on their lonesome. Make a minigame, such as NPC chess, where you need to use specific abilities and patterns that produce effects on the chess pieces, causing them to move. Just an idea, because I haven’t seen a server yet that makes good advantage of having abilities and effects, and to see it in action would be interesting.</p>

-A unique idea I’ve thought of in the past is being able to “concoct” paint mixtures, and colour robes, boots, certain hats and armour, etc. Players could express their mood in their armour, which would always be interesting to see. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
-Have your webite relate at least somewhat to the theme of a forums if you’re going to use one.<br>
-I’ve never stuck with a server that made overly visible the “Become a Member” link. Just my personal pet peeve. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
-If you’re going to provide a ::yell feature, have channels that people could join. This is essentially just clan chats with a nice little twist on them.<br>
-If you’re going to provide a generalized training area, have any attackable NPC in that area have little to no drops, and when you encounter those monsters outside of the training area they have their regular drop tables. This way you can prevent drop farming and actually have a person get involved with the game to earn their items.<br>
-…</p>
<p>I can provide more, but could you share what sort of server you’re looking to get into developing?</p>

              <p>Hey guys, I’m just wondering what people consider to be their perfect server content wise. Forget about things like respectful and mature staff, no lagging, constant uptime, etc, because we all know they are important.<br>
I am wanting to know peoples descriptions of their perfect 317 Runescape Private Server. I want to know what kind of server you guys would invest a lot of your time and effort into. Something completely unique with original features? If so, what kind of features? And in what ways would you want it to be unique? Or would you prefer an accurate remake of Runescape around the 2006-2007 era? If so, what differences would you like to see if any?<br>
I am looking forward to hearing your responses!</p>
