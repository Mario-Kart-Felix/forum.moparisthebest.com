I am wanting to know peoples descriptions of their perfect 317 Runescape Private Server. I want to know what kind of server you guys would invest a lot of your time and effort into. Something completely unique with original features? If so, what kind of features? And in what ways would you want it to be unique? Or would you prefer an accurate remake of Runescape around the 2006-2007 era? If so, what differences would you like to see if any?<br>
I am looking forward to hearing your responses!</p>

        <p>Don’t attempt another remake because there is already servers like RuneRebels and 2006Redone which have been in development for a while and still don’t see a very satisfying player count.</p>
<p>As for me, I’ll highlight a few things:</p>
<p>Staff team:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Have ‘junior’ moderators and ‘senior moderators’. Junior moderators can kick and mute, and Senior moderators can 24-hour ban.[/li]<br>
[li]Administrator positions should be strictly reserved for developers and the occasional community administrator (which is, in my eyes, just a Senior moderator in disguise).[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Content</p>
<p>[ul][li]In beginning stages of public access, please don’t provide a full-access map. The community gets spread out, and with nobody to talk to outside of a PM system, the game can get boring pretty fast.[/li]<br>
[li]I’ve always been a bit of a fan of a spawn/home area that followed a server’s theme. Edgeville has always been a good spawn area for PKing servers, while Miscellania has been a favourite for general themed servers. If you’re going to choose to develop a server that revolves around one major aspect of the game, make the spawn area have some sort of relation to the game itself.[/li]<br>
[li]Let us at least know every once in a while that development is actually occuring. By this I don’t mean tell us that NPC’s have been added to a new area, but let us know if you’re designing a new NPC and give us a preview/concept description of it.[/li]<br>
[li]Make sure that the majority of P2P features don’t have a significant impact on the game or forums. The last thing I enjoy seeing is donator crowns, obvnoxiously visible forum ranks, and abilities to do what regular players cannot (i.e. access to commands that F2P players cannot access).[/li]<br>
[li]Quests/dynamic minigames.[/li]<br>
[li]Holiday/community events. It’s also interesting sometimes to see a discontinued item circulate after time goes on, and have that helmet from the beginning of 2013 that you had to be there to get.[/li]<br>
[li]…[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Just a few things, I could go on if you’re still willing to read. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

-Have your webite relate at least somewhat to the theme of a forums if you’re going to use one.<br>
-I’ve never stuck with a server that made overly visible the “Become a Member” link. Just my personal pet peeve. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
-If you’re going to provide a ::yell feature, have channels that people could join. This is essentially just clan chats with a nice little twist on them.<br>
-If you’re going to provide a generalized training area, have any attackable NPC in that area have little to no drops, and when you encounter those monsters outside of the training area they have their regular drop tables. This way you can prevent drop farming and actually have a person get involved with the game to earn their items.<br>
-…</p>
<p>I can provide more, but could you share what sort of server you’re looking to get into developing?</p>

<a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,539866.0.html%5B/quote%5D" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,539866.0.html[/quote]</a><br>
Uniqueness is always a good thing to have. Just make sure that there is relation to the original game. When the game is entirely unique, it scares away some potential members. For example, include effects and abilities in things such as PVP and PVM but don’t stray so far as to make fighting revolve solely around abilities, but if you want to provide the option alongside normal weapons then go for it. RuneScape was initially going the right direction with abilities, but now with the new combat setup I was driven away.<br>
EDIT: This doesn’t mean to not provide areas and scenarios when you can use abilities and effects all on their lonesome. Make a minigame, such as NPC chess, where you need to use specific abilities and patterns that produce effects on the chess pieces, causing them to move. Just an idea, because I haven’t seen a server yet that makes good advantage of having abilities and effects, and to see it in action would be interesting.</p>

All very good points my friend. By all means continue. As for the server, I am planning on continuing the Embattled development, but I have just been wondering whether an extremely unique server is what people are after nowadays.<br>

[/quote]<br>
Uniqueness is always a good thing to have. Just make sure that there is relation to the original game. When the game is entirely unique, it scares away some potential members. For example, include effects and abilities in things such as PVP and PVM but don’t stray so far as to make fighting revolve solely around abilities, but if you want to provide the option alongside normal weapons then go for it. RuneScape was initially going the right direction with abilities, but now with the new combat setup I was driven away.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah I understand exactly what you mean. In that case I’m hoping to continue the development after my final exams at university (a couple of weeks), and hopefully get a satisfactory server for people to give feedback on. Then I can ensure the balance between Runescape and unique is perfect.</p>
<p>Anyway, I still would like to hear what yourself and other community members would love to see in their dream server.</p>

        <p>If you compile all of my posts in this thread into one big blurb of a summary, you’ll understand what I look for in a server that I will stick with in the long run. All of these posts have been from what I like to see personally. I don’t look for something specific when I join a server, I just look for the above mentioned.<br>
EDIT: I should add that I always enjoy seeing ‘easter eggs’ in a server, such as allusions to popular movies, books, etc.<br>
EDIT2: Also, try to get your community involved in a long-term project, such as an “Embattled Wiki.” Host it on your on website using software such as <a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">DokuWiki</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you for the input! I actually also ran a very successful server back in 2008 and the community was very professionally run. Being a more mature aged member of the forums I don’t really want people running my server (moderators) who aren’t fair and professional, which usually (but not always) comes with age. I feel that I am fairly knowledgable in running a professional server considering in my past servers, I do not allow anyone to spawn items, not even myself. I don’t allow people to purchase items or anything that will give them a huge advantage over players who can’t afford to pay. I treat moderators as having a job, and not a privilege. Obviously a bug free and well performing server (even under attacks) is a given. As is good website. And I completely agree with everything you say.</p>

<p>You don’t think so? I actually believe to an extent to make a server enjoyable and make players stay long instead of a few weeks before it gets boring, it is very much to do with the content in the server. Whether that be XP rates, minigames to keep players occupied, tasks that can be done where players both work together and verse one another (such as dungeons, and duel arena). Obviously an optimal server will include mature and fair staff who make the right decisions in all aspects. Good performance, good website integration and everything like that. That is fairly straightforward. But in regards to content, that is what keeps the player entertained and makes them stay online for longer. But yes I do see your point. There are more important aspects to content, but since I feel I know what makes a professionally run server, I am talking specifically about what would entertain people in regards to content.</p>

        <p>A lot of times money making methods aren’t always made obvious to players so you need to make sure some are clear even if they are very repetitive. Players just want to understand what to do in order to make the big bucks. A simple general store that you can sell items to can be a huge difference, especially when the server is starting out and there is no one to sell items to. Being able to generate items and gold efficiently is a key part to a perfect server.</p>
<p>Unique content is always helpful to draw players in but they also expect most standard skills, minigames, and other features to be pretty flawless.</p>

        <p>Wow, this is an interesting conversation. I won`t supply a huge list of things that I prefer or not. I am not really a “player”. From the content aspect of the client:</p>
<ol>
<li>Huge variety of customization.</li>
<li>Great data and no glitches.</li>
<li>No customs, no big caches, no 10000 sprites. Clean looking, professional cache.</li>
<li>Great looking code for future maintenance reasons.</li>
</ol>
<p>PS: Sorry for bad english grammar. Kinda tired.<br>
PS2: *Flame_, I really like you <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
