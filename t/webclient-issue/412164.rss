The Webclient works perfectly for me, but when I have friends try it, this is what they get. Can someone help please?

Try it out if it helps: http://www.evolution-pk.net/index.php?page=Webclient

Thanks,

<p>He knew for a fact that I wasn’t advertising, he was doing it to try and be spiteful so he could “maybe” someday become a moderator on the forums. No one else looks in the “client help” section. Then again, when I do look back I guess I was a bit harsh with my reaction, but still I don’t think it was necessary for him to post it.[/quote]Obviously it was necessary. I can guarentee being “Spiteful” was not what I was amiming for. My goal is to point the people who are to ignorant to read the section rule to the right direction. And no it wasn’t harsh. It was you flaming at me because i’m so “Spiteful.” I coulden’t care less about moderator on Mopar. I am here to help the community. And also just because no one looks at the Client Help section dosen’t mean you get special treatment and get to post in the section where people “Know” what they are doing. Clearly the rule is posted in the rules section. Although you may not know you were advertising (or you didn’t think you were) it is still advertising because you posted a link.</p>
