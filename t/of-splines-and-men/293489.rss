    <title>Of splines and men</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/of-splines-and-men/293489</link>
    <description>While splines are a great way to make mouse movement [i]look[/i] more realistic ask yourself this question: Can I be fooled by splines? If you can watch a mouse and tell the difference between a [i]human[/i]-powered mouse and a [i]spline[/i]-powered mouse do you think they can too? 

Remember, the game can be recorded and played back with a bit of work (on our side) and with ease (on their side). I know, for a fact, that client recording has been done (I have done it and wL has done it). Despite what you may think, the recorded playback files are very small compared to an AVI or mpeg of the same length of time.

With this in mind, splines are nice, but they look hilarious if not done perfectly. If you don&#39;t believe me, use snagit or some other recording software to watch your own mouse movements and tell me you don&#39;t chuckle a little when you play it back. (of course if you have the client playback implemented use that :) )</description>

              <p>I can see how using Moparscape as a vector to collect human-like (well, moparscapian-like :/) mouse movements is useful, but IMO talking about storing a ton of movements and transforming them is the wrong way to go about this.</p>

<p>[quote=“speedster239, post:60, topic:293489”]This is theoretically possible, but practically it won’t survive. Scaling human movements which don’t follow any predictable pattern or formula, or law, will work in time, but a computer can catch up if these scaled movements are read from a database. The bottom line is unless you know what goes on on their end you’re in the dark. Eventually they’ll map out these movements script-for-script if necessary, and create an exception for them as well.</p>
<p>Depending on the field of application, publicly available bots like RSBot are at risk of Jagex just picking apart whatever system it uses right from the code itself. However, in a large scale this could work…</p>
<p>Gathering movements, of say users of the program itself on the fly, scaling them like you say right then and there, and using them in working scripts, or the scripts of others users by communicating through a server, could cover Jagex being able to detect hard coded systems.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">This vaguely reminds me of <a href="http://kaitnieks.com/SleepWalker/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://kaitnieks.com/SleepWalker/</a>, or at least the way it handles program-user to program-user interaction for some mutual benefit.</span></p>
<p>Probably too far fetched, but definitely the first thing that came to mind.[/quote]</p>
<p>Moparisthebest, I like the idea of incorporating it into the Mopar client, you’d be able to collect <span class="bbcode-i">tons</span> of data really quickly.</p>

<p>That doesn’t work unfortunately , if you calculated that using probability in maths, you’d almost get an infinite number.<br>
imagine you have to record movements of mouse to any pixel from any pixel, now that is a big calculation.</p>
<p>but if you meant like just collecting few millions of curves to be stretched or compressed later on to form the path wich will connect two points, then that is not a bad idea.</p>

<p>Thought I should note…What about Jagex being able to view what’s running on your machine, or even if that’s not possible, what’s running in the JVM. They see a malicious process, for example “WhateverBot”, and that should raise a red flag. It seems like everybody jumps through hoops with all of these anti-detection systems, when in reality it could be as simple as 1-2-3 for them…This seems simple, and something along the lines of what I would do in their position. Not that would I would do matters.</p>

<p>Good questions, you should always be thinking about what they could possibly do and what you should do.  However, if your bot runs the unsigned client in a sandbox just like a real browser would (with a proper SecurityManager) they can’t do any type of detection like this, so you don’t have to worry about it.</p>

<p>You aren’t going to do something stupid like hard code 200 mouse methods to choose from and release it in a public bot.  I am talking about recording thousands upon thousands of mouse movements, and on runtime, the program could pick a certain number of random ones for itself, then from them choose the ones to modify and use.  Jagex couldn’t possibly detect a system such as this that relies only on randomness and a continually growing database of actual human mouse movements.</p>
