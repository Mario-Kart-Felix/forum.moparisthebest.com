    <description>Guys, well, moderators, when you lock a topic because it is copy and paste, leached or any of the sort, shouldn&#39;t you modify the post so people can&#39;t see it? Because people can still follow the tutorial, and most likely will rep the poster...

              <p>I personally wouldn’t bother removing it unless you remove the whole topic (so in other words, I wouldn’t bother with just editing it).<br>
What I used to do, and still do, is lock the topic, issue a form of warning, and leave it.<br>
In a day’s time or so I then go back and remove all of the old locked topics.</p>
<p>It’s effective, it minimises clutter, and it gives the user a fair chance to see that the topic has been locked and the reason that they have been warned for, should one exist.</p>
<p>However, I think it would be great if warning someone quoted the message that they wrote and the warning we give them when sending them the PM. This would be better because then immediate removal of troublesome posts and topics is completely possible.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Tree, post:5, topic:205444”]I just made myself the biggest bacon &amp; egg sandwich. You wonder why? Well i found a bit of bacon at the back of the fridge. The morning before i had to use some honey soaked ham. Though it was nice, it wasn’t what i felt like. The day after a decided to book eggs for dinner, as i was very hungry and pizza would have taken an hour or so.</p>
<p>So anyway, i made the eggs and bacon and then flipped over the egg to make the yolk hard. You see, if it isn’t cooked, then it will drip everywhere and make the sandwich soggy. So you flip it over and wait 15 seconds. Even if it does drip, it turns hard on the base of the egg.</p>
<p>Once you have the eggs and bacon on a plate, put the bread in the toaster on a slightly lower level then usual. You really only want is slightly crisp. After all, the bacon will dry your mouth fairly easily. Put it all on the sandwich and add whatever you feel like. Pickles, Smoked BBQ sauce or tomato sauce are excellent options.</p>
<p>Whilst that is nice, i come up with something else that was just as tasty. You start off with a piece of bread and cut a big hole in the middle. Place the piece of bread on the fry pan and put the egg in the middle. Once 3 quarters of the center is hard, flip it over. Make sure to do this fast and not to move the egg from it’s position for 15 seconds or so. Once done, flip over and put it on a place. You should now have egg + toast in one. You can add bacon on top or leave it as it is.</p>
