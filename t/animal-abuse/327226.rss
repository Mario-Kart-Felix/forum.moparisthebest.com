    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/animal-abuse/327226</link>
    <description>ibtl - up to mods to close

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a video clip circulating around the web [Video also posted on Group&#39;s &quot;Video&quot; tab] showing a horrible lady torturing a poor kitten by repeatedly stepping on it with her high heels and finally ripping out its head. DO NOT WATCH THE VIDEO IF YOU&#39;RE AFRAID OF VIOLENCE AND GORE.

This video was taken about 3 years ago, and the kitten killer has been identified. Her name is &quot;Wang Jue&quot;, &quot;Gainmas&quot; on the internet. She bought the pair of heels on eBay and was hunted down by enraged animal lovers several years ago. She and the video producer (Li YueJun) had apologised, [b]but THEY WERE NEVER PUNISHED accordingly[/b] because there was no specific law in China regarding animal cruelty and abuse. She justified her actions by saying that she was depressed due to a failed marriage.

However, there were also images of her performing similar acts on other helpless creatures - How does she explain those?

She was also registered with QQ, a popular Chinese message service, where she wrote of herself: &quot;I furiously crush everything to do with you and me.&quot;
-
Before her QQ address went dead, its owner had several conversations. In one, she is coy, saying &quot;So what?&quot; when asked if the pictures are of her, and then, when asked again, replying: &quot;In theory.&quot;
-
When confronted by a reporter, she became defensive, saying: &quot;Suddenly hundreds of people are on my QQ and cursing me. What&#39;s the problem if I crush cats? It&#39;s a type of experience. You wouldn&#39;t understand.&quot;
-

PeopleDaily:
&quot;She was attacked with thousands of phone calls and threats. She was
mercilessly shamed, lost her job, and was forced to post a video
apology online where she acknowledged her actions and asked for
forgiveness.&quot;

Is that punishment alone enough to atone for all her deeds?
We seek to find the appropriate authorities and make her account for her actions, even though it was something that happened 3 or 4 years ago, she escaped scott-free. We would hope to see that a local anti animal abuse society takes notice of this and ensures she gets the punishment she deserves!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

              <p>I honestly can’t watch the video. I’ve lived on a farm most of my life and love animals, and we have tons of cats. There is also one with a bunny as I remember. I can’t understand how someone could do this to a helpless animal, what sick thoughts that go through their head.</p>
<p>I am locking this since it may be disturbing to others.</p>

<p>Motherfucking bitch shouldn’t even deserve to live. Even if you don’t like cats, you shouldn’t kill a kitten this way. It never deserved this treatment.</p>
<p>What if YOUR child got fucking stepped on and it’s eye and brain squashed out of it’s brain? Animals are God’s creations and lives too. They deserve at least some amount of respect and humane treatment.</p>

<p>This bitch, shouldin’t be on this planet.</p>

<blockquote>There is a video clip circulating around the web [Video also posted on Group's "Video" tab] showing a horrible lady torturing a poor kitten by repeatedly stepping on it with her high heels and finally ripping out its head. DO NOT WATCH THE VIDEO IF YOU'RE AFRAID OF VIOLENCE AND GORE.
<p>This video was taken about 3 years ago, and the kitten killer has been identified. Her name is “Wang Jue”, “Gainmas” on the internet. She bought the pair of heels on eBay and was hunted down by enraged animal lovers several years ago. She and the video producer (Li YueJun) had apologised, <span class="bbcode-b">but THEY WERE NEVER PUNISHED accordingly</span> because there was no specific law in China regarding animal cruelty and abuse. She justified her actions by saying that she was depressed due to a failed marriage.</p>
<p>However, there were also images of her performing similar acts on other helpless creatures - How does she explain those?</p>
<h2>She was also registered with QQ, a popular Chinese message service, where she wrote of herself: “I furiously crush everything to do with you and me.”</h2>
<h2>Before her QQ address went dead, its owner had several conversations. In one, she is coy, saying “So what?” when asked if the pictures are of her, and then, when asked again, replying: “In theory.”</h2>
<h2>When confronted by a reporter, she became defensive, saying: “Suddenly hundreds of people are on my QQ and cursing me. What’s the problem if I crush cats? It’s a type of experience. You wouldn’t understand.”</h2>
<p>PeopleDaily:<br>
“She was attacked with thousands of phone calls and threats. She was<br>
mercilessly shamed, lost her job, and was forced to post a video<br>
apology online where she acknowledged her actions and asked for<br>
forgiveness.”</p>
<p>Is that punishment alone enough to atone for all her deeds?<br>
We seek to find the appropriate authorities and make her account for her actions, even though it was something that happened 3 or 4 years ago, she escaped scott-free. We would hope to see that a local anti animal abuse society takes notice of this and ensures she gets the punishment she deserves!</p>
