    <title>Hatchet &amp; Woodcutting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hatchet-woodcutting/550563</link>
    <description>Hey guys!

Just doing some improvement on woodcutting and these are the problems I have faced


[ul][li]When woodcutting I would like my players to have to have a hatchet equipped, at the moment if they have it in their inventory it will still use it. However if they hold it, it tells you to hold it to cut the tree. [/li]
[li]Allow dragon hatchets to be used in woodcutting, at the moment it does not think that the hatchet is an axe and will not cut using it[/li]
[li]When a player lights a fire next to a tree it lights it on top of the tree and makes it disappear[/li][/ul]


Here is the Woodcutting file and the firemaking file.

Wooductting: http://pastebin.com/ZimaubpR
Firemaking: http://pastebin.com/rrHX8sFH

If you need to see any more, let me know. I have an idea what it is, maybe clipping? and the axe issue just lost me.</description>

^that’s your code that checks for the hatchet.</p>
<p><code>                if (ItemAssistant.playerHasItem(player, 1351))
                {
                        return true;
                }
                else if (ItemAssistant.playerHasItem(player, 1359) &amp;&amp; player.skillLevel[Constants.WOODCUTTING] &gt;= 41)
                {
                        return true;
                }</code><br>
This part specifically…<br>
I also don’t get why you’re checking for hatchets this way. It’s a really poor way to do it, as you’d have to add an if statement and an else if for <span class="bbcode-u">every</span> hatchet.<br>
Consider using an enum or loading the item data externally.<br>
Literally anything you need to edit with hatchets is basically in that boolean.<br>

For firemaking:<br>
Add region clipping. Then add clipped walking to your firemaking. Google for tutorials on how this is done as it’s been released 100 times over.<br>

<p>Not being rude but are you doing the improvements or are you asking others to do it for you? Because if you can’t do stuff like this yourself what’s the point.</p>
<p>1: Before they start the cutting action, you’ll need an if statement to check if they have a hatchet in their inventory or their hands.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">private boolean canCut(Player p) {
if (p.equipment[hands] == hatchet) return true;
if (p.getItems().playerHasItem(hatchet ,1)) return true;
return false;
}</code></pre>
<p>The above is sort of pseudo code and won’t work. You’ll need to do some tweaking but it’s along the right lines. You’ll have to loop through an array of valid hatchets or something.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Same applies to the above, add the dragon hatchet to the array or however you store hatchet data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because your fire object is being spawned on top of the tree object, which deletes the tree. Make it check the tile to see if there’s an obejct there before placing the fire.</p>
</li>
</ol>
