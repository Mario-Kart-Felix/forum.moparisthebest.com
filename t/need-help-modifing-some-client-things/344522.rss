    <title>Need help modifing some client things</title>

    <description>ok guys, i downloaded swat client 2010, but before using it, i have to modify some things, which i don&#39;t understand:

Things that you need to do:!
-You need to pack the anim files inside of the cache
-You need to pack the Models inside of the cache

Download link:
client still has the 317 models in them while there not needed.
Client:
UPLOAD.EE - Download Swat_s_Client_2010.rar

Add these in the cache folder or pack them inside of the cache.
Anims:
UPLOAD.EE - Download anim.rar

474 Models:
UPLOAD.EE - Download models.rar

There should be no errors or anti leech, dont forget to change the npc bits to
16 not 12

There is one thing i forgot to add inside the class7
Code:
    private final void method175(int i, Class25 class25, Class11 class11, int j, int k, int l, int i1,
        boolean flag, int j1) {
    if(i1 ==  15552|| i1 == 26923||i1 == 2396||i1==24299||i1==21304)return;
replace that


EXTRA INFORMATION:
Suite still works.
Everything can be copied from the client, and the .idx and dats taken from the client
port is 43595 not 43594

-----------------------------


ok so i downloaded the the models and animations and pasted them on its carpets.

then i opened client.java and modified 43595 to 43494...

but now i idk what else to do, i still need to do some things, cuz when i try to log on server from that client i see a black screen for 1 sec and then i get dced. i hope you guys can help me.</description>
