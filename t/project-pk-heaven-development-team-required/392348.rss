[size=14pt][b][u]About Project PK-Heaven[/u][/b][/size]
Project PK-Heaven is a long term goal that I aim to accomplish. The Aim of this project is too start a RuneScape Private server from a virtually blank source and to compete as one of the top servers! 


[size=14pt][b][u]What I&#39;m looking for[/u][/b][/size]
I&#39;m looking to assemble a dedicated development team that are also interested in this project. I&#39;m looking first and foremost for a couple of people with extensive knowledge of coding RSPS&#39;s to aid my limited knowledge and help code the client/server. Secondly, I would like a GFX designer, someone who is very very good at making graphics to design the webpage/forums and any other graphics required. 


[size=14pt][b][u]How would this benefit you?[/u][/b][/size]
Coders and GFX designers [b]WILL receive a cut of donations when the server is up and running.


[size=14pt][b][u]How to apply![/size]
[code]Which role are you interested in?:
What is your age?:
What country do you live in?:
Do you have any past experience? If so, tell me/show me:
Do you have anyone to back up what you&#39;re saying?:
