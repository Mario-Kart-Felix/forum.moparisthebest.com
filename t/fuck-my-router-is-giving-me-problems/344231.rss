    <description>Okay, so my router IP that i login with is 10.0.0.1(I know it&#39;s weird)


I have a netgear router, I am currently trying to run my server on Wireless.  The port is forwarded on the IP 10.0.0.3(preferred IP)


The server was working perfectly fine, my 20 developers and testers were all on with me, then the server dc&#39;d.  Now this happened.  I tried lots, messing with the port forwarding and messing with the client.  Nothing worked.  I need expert help here...</description>
