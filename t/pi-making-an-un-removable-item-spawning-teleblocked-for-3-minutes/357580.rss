    <title>(PI) Making an un-removable item &amp; Spawning teleblocked for 3 minutes?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-making-an-un-removable-item-spawning-teleblocked-for-3-minutes/357580</link>
    <description>Ok so i have an npc that you talk to when you spawn, you choose the side you want to go, that being fally or varrock ,and it saves it to your player save, so you can&#39;t choose 2, what i want to do, is use the standard red &amp; blue capes, blue for fally &amp; red for varrock, to be not just given as an item depending on which you choose
but equipped, and unremoveable (i&#39;ll be trying to use these to establish a red vs blue pvp toggle) &gt;_&lt;

and a simpler question : how/where do i add it so you&#39;re automatically teleblocked till you either talk to this npc, or you wait say 15 minutes?


Thanks, jeddac.</description>
