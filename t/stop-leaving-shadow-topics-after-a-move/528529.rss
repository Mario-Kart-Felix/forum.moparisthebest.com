    <title>Stop leaving shadow topics after a move</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stop-leaving-shadow-topics-after-a-move/528529</link>
    <description>When a topic is moved, the moderators seem to always leave the shadow topic (such as [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,647263.msg4352953.html#msg4352953]this topic[/url]) in its place. I don&#39;t see a reason for leaving this, it just seems counter productive - why bother moving a thread if you&#39;re just going to keep a thread in its current place?

Before the &quot;staff shouldn&#39;t have to work&quot; bandwagon arrives - it&#39;s a single checkbox (it could even be automated with a single script edit)</description>

i think you, being a staff member, have no right to blatantly call people names (flame) when they have not done anything but state a SUGGESTION and reasons why they support it. just because you don’t agree with something doesn’t mean you can act immature.<br>

I think they should be left in place, their are more efficient systems that could be in place but as per usual the staff as a whole suck and it isn’t too big of a deal anyways so don’t worry about it.</p>

Stop generalising it as the staff, it isn’t the staff. The only person with access to the source is moparisthebest.

<p>I just offered to do free work for you… I’m certainly not the ungrateful one. Taharok also has the forum source, I believe. Go ahead and lock the topic (you don’t have to, though - remember this is a volunteer job and you’re not paid to do it which exempts you from any and all work whatsoever), infact you may as well delete this whole board because nothing posted in here is ever considered because you’re (this is a generalisation of the staff) a bunch of dysfunctional fuckheads</p>

I think you missed what i said, new people might not click the “notify” button when browsing a topic. That will cause a problem when they go back to look for it and it isn’t there and they haven’t been pmed because all they were doing was looking at it.</p>

Then sending a PM in the same way will be fine. Send a PM to everyone who’s posted within the last week, and the OP (whether he posted in the last week or not). Also send it to any users who have requested that they be notified of any replies.</p>

<p>A script to send a PM to every member who has commented on that thread within the last week (including the OP) explaining that the thread was moved, and where it was moved to would probably be a lot more helpful (as well as feeling kinder) than just a thread. The user doesn’t get any notification that the thread was moved unless they actually look for the “Moved:” thread.</p>

<p>Well don’t give me idiotic replies and I won’t be a sarcastic runt.

If it isn’t broken, don’t fix it, simple as that. David has already stated the best point in this thread, these topics don’t just help one person. A PM does.</p>

<p>The R and the C key are pretty far away from eachother on the keyboard so I’m not sure how you managed to end up with the typo “runt”. If you guys actually got off your arses and did something for once then someone could help - I understand that you’re all too lazy to do it yourselves, so put it on GitHub like you’ve been saying for ages and someone else will help.</p>

<p>I’ve seen it before where 6 or more redirection topics have been placed at once, thus pushing 6 other topics off the front page. In boards such as Server Advertisement or Server Help this could have a lot of impact on the reach of the topic.</p>

</aside>
<p>To explain this, refer to Ruby’s posts regarding “bursts of moderation”. That usually happens when none of the staff members are on and we log on with 40 to 50+ reports, and 10-15% of those are usually about moving a topic. I know you’ve seen it happen, but it’s very rare because we usually keep the reports at sub-10.</p>

<p>why can’t we pm the user stating it was moved then?</p>

</aside>
<p>Do you honestly expect a mod to pm someone rather than checking a box that barely ever causes any obstruction? There’s been more issues brought around by this topic than there ever has been by a moved topic. Alongside what David says, these topics help others, not just the OP.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve seen it before where 6 or more redirection topics have been placed at once, thus pushing 6 other topics off the front page. In boards such as Server Advertisement or Server Help this could have a lot of impact on the reach of the topic.</p>

<p>So you’re going to make an example of something that happens once in a blue moon and even then doesn’t really cause an issue? Great logic.<br>

Could you please keep to a constructive tone instead of sarcastic replies? Thanks.</p>
<p>As a web developer, you ust know that it wouldn’t be too hard to modify the PHP to send a message instead of posting a new thread?[/quote]<br>
Well don’t give me idiotic replies and I won’t be a sarcastic runt. Obviously it isn’t going to be difficult but I’m certainly not going to do it, moparisthebest isn’t going to take time out of his life to do it, I just don’t see the need in it. If it isn’t broken, don’t fix it, simple as that. David has already stated the best point in this thread, these topics don’t just help one person. A PM does.</p>
