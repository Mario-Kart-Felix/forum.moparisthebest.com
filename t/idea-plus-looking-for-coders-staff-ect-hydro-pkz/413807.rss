    <description>so i have come up with an idea to change the way runescape private servers are and the way ppl look at them till now most ppl have just designed a private server just for fun or to get high levels or just for the look good feeling as we used to back in the day when moparscape and hamatchi was arround but now we are advancing and ppl are willing to expand but not many ppl can do that without money. i am preposiong an idea to build a comunity of private servers not just 1 but many that would take how every long it would take to code and perfect but i think this would be a good idea as u dont see many (companys) or a name taking over a few servers they always have the 1 or 2 i think having a server for each type of different server also with other games that can be made into private servers could be used in this also in the near future to make a comunity so ppl know the name Of the (company) after a while and can think yeh i played 1 of thouse servers mabey i try the server for world of warcraft so forth the only reson i am putting this idea forward is i think there is alot to be made from this and hope&#39;ing no one will steal this idea and i am hopeing to take ppl on and make this idea a reality thanks for your time to read this and sorry for the bad grammar as i have spent more time on pc than i have with school my life lol now i have exlaind here is your bit ;)

<p>Blue = Leave.  You have horrible grammar, probably don’t even know what Java is, and I doubt you can program because of your grammar.  So your making other people program stuff for you, and not doing it yourself.  You have no room to talk.  Also, Once again i doubt it’s gonna go big.  Nothing it ever goes big, there’s to many servers.</p>
<p>OT:  I hope this goes so far that you rill throw Near Reality straight off Rune - Locus!!!(and basic177gay123)</p>
