    <description>[size=6][b]IF YOU ARE FROM THE TUTORIAL SECTION, PLEASE LEAVE.[/b][/size]


Hello.

Originally, this was a server owned by a friend of mine and me, but he doesn&#39;t have internet atm, and he is telling me to wait and that he will get. Over a year has passed, and he still doesn&#39;t have an internet connection anywhere but at his friends. That is why i&#39;m opening a development team thread for Synestia!

I have already bought the domain, setup a professional vBulletin forums with sections, ranks and mods(shoutbox, staff apps etc).

I am going to be providing the VPS(4GB RAM, look below for picture), GFX and my friend will be head admin. However, we need a coder(java is a must, but i have a friend that is TRUSTED that can program PHP for me free if needed).

The coder can choose what revision we are going to use(must be a stable base), and he MUST be a professional coder that is able to create his own code. Examples:

Minigames
Skills
Dupe/Bug Fixes

etc. You get the picture.

We will be sharing the donations 50/50. As the server grows, we will have to buy a dedicated server. First we will buy the dedi, then split 2/4 of the money left from donations that month(2/4 left if needed).

If you are interested, please post below with the following format:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some of your work:
What programming languages do you know?:
What are you able to code?:
Why do you want to be in the development team?:
MSN:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note: [b]I HAVE PHYSICAL ACCESS TO THE SERVER, IF YOU ARE A SCAMMER, LEAVE.[/b]</description>

<p>Well you are certainly a derp. I’m not from the tutorial section, that’s why im requesting a coder. Tutorial kids make crappy servers via tutorials. If i were from the tutorial section, don’t u think that i would have made one of those shit servers aswell?</p>
