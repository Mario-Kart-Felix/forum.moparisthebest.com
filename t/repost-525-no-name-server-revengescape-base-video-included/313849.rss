k well, the server i was coding for ended up shutting down a month or so ago and i recently might be selling my laptop and i don&#39;t want all the server shit on my new one (if i get one) so i&#39;m going to pre-release this server for the public.

Atm:
Base: Revengescape
Cache: 525
Client (Just a basic 525 Dragonscape Ip changer [I hope]): http://www.mediafire.com/?dtezwuz0mzg

Pur3z (for shops)
Owner of Rsfk, for letting me work with him.
Me.
Scape Java.
Who ever else that wasn&#39;t included, your now included.


Server Specs:

All Pvp armour, Spirit shields, ALL Brawling gloves + stats, some other shit, basically everything in pur3z plus some little extras like brawl gloves

Drops have added over 100+ more items to them

Skilling, Runecrafting, Fishing, Woodcutting, Fletching, Cooking, Thieving, Mining.

Skills are spread out i guess...
 Mining = South Varrock west bank
Woodcutting = Everywhere there are tree&#39;s.    
 Fishing = East of edgeville by the Grand Exchange walls, along the bridge (Note you need to fix fishing to allow salmon fishing etc instead of just Shark fishing at 75 fishing).
Cooking = There are spawned fires outside the fish area as well as a banker.
The fires are spread out, and the banker is on the opposite side of the fires, so it isn&#39;t TOO easy.
 Thieving = At ::edge right west of the tele spot/bank.
 

Pvp Specs

Has the same drop system as revengescape/pur3z (pur3z is revengescape) just theres about 100+ more items

Added Granite maul spec, couldn&#39;t fix it to spec as soon as you click so i made it hit 3 times as if you did a perfect g maul spec, good for rushing still, very accurate as well

Made basically all pre coded specs alot more accurate, ags, vesta etc, just so players can hit accurate and what they want to see when they Pk.

Was working on a dh system, although for some reason i can&#39;t make it hit accuratly like i planned.
At the moment, i&#39;ve seen a 94 max which is my set max hit for 1-10 hp, although it&#39;s extremly rare to hit and as well it&#39;s extremly rare to hit at all.

Added a few items to the system, such as Combat robes from F.O.G, added bonuses to them as well as pvp gloves.

Added my own pk point spending via commands. Works flawless and is easy to use, not easy points, as well as it gives the server an econamy.

Works like so ::buy + the 3 letter short word for the item, simply to ::shoplist to see what they  are so if you wanted fire cape it would be like so ::buyfrc, it would remove 50 pk points from the player, and as well only works IF you have 50+ pk points.

Spread pking around, make ::varrockwest which is multi pking north of the bank, just for clans, teams etc for fun pking. there is still ::edge ::clanwars(or w.e the command is but i think you can figure out where it goes) uhm, ::bh.

Other Specs -
Home is at the Grand Exchange.

In order to talk a new player must type ::edge and thieve a stall in order to talk
this was my default anti-spam which works very well as 100% all crashers cannot talk. although i didn&#39;t manage to work on a anti crasher as is, because i don&#39;t host, so i didn&#39;t see the point, and the owner didn&#39;t request it at the time because we never got crashed.

Leveling, instead of just ::master players can now use ::zerker ::pure ::strpure and ::tank
this EXTREMLY widens the range of what players can do. i WAS working on a ::purepk which is a basic command where if your above 1 def you CANNOT tele there, so it&#39;s specifically made for pures or ::zerker so if your above 45 def you can&#39;t tele there as well, as i know many pkers would LOVE this for pking.

Bh works, as well as clan war portals

There are approximatly 15 ::Buy commands, ranging from spirit shields, brawl gloves to slay helm or ags.

In the folder, there is a Item list generator Server&gt;lists&gt;~Run

To make yourself admin, log into the account you want, LOG OUT, go to Data&gt;SavedGames&gt;Your Account, open the file search &quot;rights&quot; Change the &gt;0&lt; to &gt;2&lt;. save log in, done. I Believe the ::giveadmin works as well, but you need to be an admin to give admin so you&#39;d have to do the above first

Here is a link to Pur3z for observation of pictures: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,395185.0.html

and heres a link to Revengescape server advertisement(sorry for anything unaccepted by the TOS of moparscape, as this is from google): 
http://www.google.com/forums/showthread.php?t=30356 

(replace &quot;google&quot; with rune l0cu5(?) i can&#39;t type it. to view the page)

None atm, give me a few hours to make a Video and Upload it, i&#39;ll get some links of pur3z and revengescape as it looks basically like them.


Rate&#39;n&#39;Hate And enjoy it.</description>
