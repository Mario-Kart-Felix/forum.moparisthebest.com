        <p>The Beginning of the Solar System</p>
<p>Scientists believe that the solar system was formed when a cloud of gas and dust in space was disturbed, maybe by the explosion of a nearby star (called a supernova).</p>
<p>This explosion made waves in space which squeezed the cloud of gas and dust. Squeezing made the cloud start to collapse, as gravity pulled the gas and dust together.</p>
<p>Just like a dancer that spins faster as she pulls in her arms, the cloud began to spin as it collapsed. Eventually, the cloud grew hotter and denser in the center, with a disk of gas and dust surrounding it that was hot in the center but cool at the edges.</p>
<p>As the disk got thinner and thinner, particles began to stick together and form clumps. Some clumps got bigger, as particles and small clumps stuck to them, eventually forming planets or moons .</p>
<p>Near the center of the cloud, where planets like Earth formed, only rocky material could stand the great heat. Icy matter settled in the outer regions of the disk, where the giant planets like Jupiter formed.</p>
<p>As the cloud continued to fall in, the center eventually got so hot that it became a star, the Sun, and blew most of the gas and dust of the new solar system. By studying fragments of rock left over from this early phase of the solar system, scientists have found that the solar system is about 4,600 million years old!</p>
<p>(Source: <a href="http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/our_solar_system/formation.html&amp;edu=elem" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/our_solar_system/formation.html&amp;edu=elem</a>)</p>
<p>That sums up the creation of our earth and our solar system pretty much. Now on to the ‘creation’ of humans and animals.</p>
<p>I think that, as XxKanexX said, that there were some meteorites that crashed into the earth, wich contained cells. To believe this, you need to believe in ‘Aliens’ aswell. Wich I do, and if you think with a bit logic and arn’t an ignorant religious person you will believe that too. There probably was a planet that contained a form of life, wich exploded. This could be caused by anything. The remaining stuff from that planet came to our solar system. Evolution did the rest.</p>

<p>This may be contrary to what I said earlier, but if you read it all you will understand it.</p>
<p>There are two main theory’s about the universe. The first is the big bang theory. When scientists found out that the universe was expanding, they came up with this. If the universe gets bigger as time advances, it will get smaller if you go back in time. If you go back far enough, everything shrinks to a single point. This point has zero volume, because it has huge gravitational force. The universe as whe know it started at the point where the single point exploded. That explosion is called the big bang. But still, that point was never ‘created’. Look up on asymptotes. In a formula, y=x*0.5 Y never reaches 0, but will get really close to it.</p>
<p>There is another theory called “steady state”. This just means that the universe was created infinite time ago, in other words never.</p>

<p>It never was created, because it’s impossible. You can mark almost all the religions fake with one argument: if god created everything, where did god come from? Everything has to have an origin, so there was no ‘start’ of the universe. It always was there, and it always will be there. Time is just created by humans.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I wonder, do you just hear this? Or if you actually believe it. For one thing, the Bible specifically says, God was, is, and always will be. So by saying that, he always existed. There never was a  creation of God, for there to be a Creation of God, there would have to be a Higher Being than God. Which is impossible, because God is the highest, the bible states it. The only reason you say everything has to have an origin is because you cannot fathom that he always was. He had no origin. As I said earlier, it is in the Bible, and for it to be in the Bible, written thousands of years ago. How is it possible, with the advancements in technology, Science, etc. That we don’t know how God has existed, forever and ever. Does that mean there were people as intelligent as us at that time? Or is it just a mere fact that God has always existed, and always will exist.</p>

It never was created, because it’s impossible. You can mark almost all the religions fake with one argument: if god created everything, where did god come from? Everything has to have an origin, so there was no ‘start’ of the universe. It always was there, and it always will be there. Time is just created by humans.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I wonder, do you just hear this? Or if you actually believe it. For one thing, the Bible specifically says, God was, is, and always will be. So by saying that, he always existed. There never was a  creation of God, for there to be a Creation of God, there would have to be a Higher Being than God. Which is impossible, because God is the highest, the bible states it. The only reason you say everything has to have an origin is because you cannot fathom that he always was. He had no origin. As I said earlier, it is in the Bible, and for it to be in the Bible, written thousands of years ago. How is it possible, with the advancements in technology, Science, etc. That we don’t know how God has existed, forever and ever. Does that mean there were people as intelligent as us at that time? Or is it just a mere fact that God has always existed, and always will exist.[/quote]<br>
I don’t think he was following the bible on that, but he might have.</p>

If an asteroid strucks a planet without an athmosphere, or with one doesn’t matter. The collision produces heat.</p>

<p>I wonder, do you just hear this? Or if you actually believe it. For one thing, the Bible specifically says, God was, is, and always will be. … As I said earlier, it is in the Bible, and for it to be in the Bible, written thousands of years ago. …[/quote]</p>
<p>Oh yea, it is written in a book. Oh my, it has to be real! NO! In the time it was written, most people were stupid. And I really mean stupid. They didn’t have an own opinion etc. Controlling those people is really hard, making laws is quite useless. They’ll never understand laws will they? So, by creating a ‘higher power’, the smarter part of the humans are able to keep controle. Wouldn’t you be scared that if you did something wrong, you’d get punished? So by saying there is a higher power, and using some hocus pocus few can controle the mass. This evolved in modern day religions, wich should be abolished IMO.</p>

<p>For one thing, I’m talking about the book of Genesis, written by the Jews. Not by the Catholics, or by the English. This happened before then.[/quote]<br>
I believe what R.I.P. RSC said was meant to apply to all ancient people, not just the Christians.</p>

<p>Look up deism, you don’t have to interpret the bible word for word, who’s to say there isn’t a higher power that created the world, and walked away. Who’s to say that power didn’t use evolution as the tool to create people?</p>
<p>religion and science can be used together, science can answer how, and religion can answer why.</p>
