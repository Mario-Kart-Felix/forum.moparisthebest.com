    <description>Hey,

I was trying to portforward and i was ready a guide and it said to change the enviromental variables. After i changed them and whatnot i click on run server and it comes up, and then leaves quickly...I am not sure if it has somthing to do with the enviromental variables or somthing else.

Any suggestions on what this could be, it&#39;s really frustrating.. :(
