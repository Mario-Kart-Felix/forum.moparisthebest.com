<p>It’s not all past administration. Take Clinton for example. Gave the country an upturn in profits over his 8 year period. He was in office only 13 years ago. Sure, a lot has happened since then, but in big picture it’s good. As for Bush, how would YOU handle the attacks on the twin towers? The only option he really had was to declare war with al-kaida, etc. Obama is seen as a shitty president (as he has made some poor decisions) but for the record, he was given a lot of shit to deal with anyway.

<p>What might you have done, oh mighty master of foreign affairs?[/quote]I’ll rephrase that. You can’t declare war on something that isn’t tangible. A war aganist “terrorism” is futile because it’s such an ambigious concept. That’s like declaring war aganist the sun.</p>
<p>Like any rational person i would have analyzed the situation, and resolved it through legal means (aka Diplomacy). Clearly Bush wasn’t capable of this considering that he allowed them to buy weapons from the US in the first place.</p>
<p>What really pisses me off is how he hasn’t been convicted for crimes aganist humanity yet (see: Guantanamo).</p>

<p>The whole US government is criminal; but I blame our previous administration more.</p>

</aside>
<p>Racism to the US government? Oh boy…</p>
<p>It’s not all past administration. Take Clinton for example. Gave the country an upturn in profits over his 8 year period. He was in office only 13 years ago. Sure, a lot has happened since then, but in big picture it’s good. As for Bush, how would YOU handle the attacks on the twin towers? The only option he really had was to declare war with al-kaida, etc. Obama is seen as a shitty president (as he has made some poor decisions) but for the record, he was given a lot of shit to deal with anyway. It’s hard to run a country that’s already in such a shitty situation.<br>
[/quote]You can’t declare war on an organization. Bush was an alcoholic redneck who had no place in the government (that goes for his father too). I would have handled the attacks like any rational person would, sadly republicans don’t believe in rational thinking, they respond with emotion.</p>

<p>Exactly, and in itself was a huge mistake. The propaganda about Communism in the US was quite impressive, that people are so easily fooled.</p>
<p>Where did i say that? Two wrongs doesn’t make one right. Even if only actual terrorists were locked up in Guantanamo it would be bad, but in this case innocent people were locked up and tortured, which is completely insane in every way. The CIA should have been disbanded decades ago, their track record of breaking national and international law is immense.</p>

L0l you can't even cite a shred of evidence to support this claim, US/China relationship is terrible and what goverment in their right mind would give up their citizens, US extradition laws are pretty tight AFAIK.
