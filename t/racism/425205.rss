    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/racism/425205</link>
    <description>Why is racism still out there in the world? It&#39;s disgusting. Today an african american was being bullied by two caucasian males, so I jumped in and me and the kid destroyed them. I was suspended of course. As I&#39;m walking out of the door, the principal comes behind me and says, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you just let the nigger get beat up?&quot; I replied, &quot;Fuck you.&quot; and walked out. What the fuck is going on that everyone is becoming racist? [s]Nazi-Revolution[/s]? Whatever it is, I&#39;m gonna stop that shit, real quick &amp; fast at my fucking school.</description>

<p>Just because they signed their lives away doesn’t mean it is justified that someone can give government secrets to the enemy and then the enemy kill soldiers. That’s like saying, you’re a witness to a murder and you plan on testifying against a mob boss. You are willingly testifying and then someone comes along and leaks out your name. The mob boss finds out and kills you. You know the repercussions of testifying against a mob boss but you do it anyway because you know it is the RIGHT thing to do.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>going along with your analogy if I was a witness to a murder I would be put in the witness protection program to you know, protect me before, during and after testifying</p>
<p>if intelligence is LEAKED TO EVERYONE, and NOT JUST TO THE ENEMY then your government and armed forces KNOW who is at risk and should take steps to protect them, if soldiers die because intelligence was released the blame doesn’t lie with just the middleman it also lies with the people that were supposed to protect those soldiers, the middleman is merely the public scapegoat</p>
<p>and on the topic of wikileaks, extreme care was and is being taken to protect soldiers and individuals by not releasing the names of those involved and not all the intelligence they get is released</p>

I don’t really care about looks, but attitude and personality.  If you walk arround just swearing and saying nigger all the time, I don’t like you.  Not because your black or white, but because I don’t like the way you ACT.  You can’t change the way people want to think.</p>

Hey, Mr. Kozs, did you see the new bill that just got passed? It’s the patriot act for Americans, look up NDAA. Then tell me if our country is looking out for our rights, then after you’re reading that go look up “SOPAA” and see that our Congress wants China to be the model for our privacy.<br>
Yes, I’m sadly American, but not totally sad, I love our current president but the previous administration totally fucked the country beyond repair, also our current Congress doesn’t give two shits about the American people and only about rich people and corporations (which are now called people apparently).</p>
