    <title>Online courses over the summer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/online-courses-over-the-summer/535469</link>
    <description>Hey guys,
I just finished my 2nd semester (Engineering). There&#39;s quite a break between now and my next semester (March 2014). Over the summer I am taking a summer semester for my Bachs of Computer Science, but there&#39;s only 2 units of work involved in it and as I quite enjoy studying and will get very bored, I was wondering if any of you know universities that offer online courses for subjects such as Physics, Mathematics (preferably fairly advanced mathematics) etc that I could take over the summer so next semester doesn&#39;t hit me like a ton of bricks. 

Particularly my knowledge of physics. I could definitely use some revision/preparation for next year in physics. I&#39;m from Australia, but I don&#39;t know if that will matter. I heard MIT in the USA offers courses like these.

Also, have any of you taken them? What were your experiences?</description>

<p>That was my engineering physics book for 4 classes so far, it’s great and has a shitton of useful information even a couple chapters on circuits and magnetic flux. also, i had one of the authors as a professor, he’s an arrogant fuck but he knows what he’s talking about</p>

              <p>Plenty depending on the subjects in question. Any decent physics textbook would do you well (which I can suggest at least two, having read through parts of them in my own classes), but you really just need to work through them. Depending on how you want to apply the physics knowledge also changes which books you may study from. For example, if you wish to just study physics for the sake of understanding the theory and problems behind various disciplines of physics, then a simple textbook would suffice (calculus-based, of course). If you’re interested in applying advanced mechanics in physical simulations, then there are other books, articles, and papers that would be useful to you in addition to textbooks (since the theory is always necessary in order to move to application).</p>
<p>That being said, what exactly are you interested in?</p>

<p>What level of math courses out of curiosity? Khan Academy teaches just about every mathematic course. I’m doing multivariable calc right now, only problem is he doesn’t offer any problems to do but you can just Google them.</p>
<p>You are right, MIT does offer online courses it’s called online courseware.<br>

<p>Stanford does too<br>

<p>all of the high up universities typically do like Yale and whatnot. Personally, I would do a mixture of mit and khan, but that is just me.</p>
