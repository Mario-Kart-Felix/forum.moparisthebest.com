    <title>Oracle-Scape Looking for client and server developer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/oracle-scape-looking-for-client-and-server-developer/479014</link>
    <description>I have founded this server for about 5-6 months and i have been keeping this server running for at least 6 months but i did take a brake from it. But i am glad to announce we are back up and looking for some developers who are trust worthy and loyal.

First off

Requirements
Gotta know java for at least more than 3 years.
Must have Skype and able to voice chat at least.
Trust and worthy
Active


Of course the server is not public or realized yet anywhere. So I and some developers who wish to join will start fixing some glitches that i know adding some stuff.

[size=14pt]This will be a payed job in the future.[/size]

Add me on Skype
