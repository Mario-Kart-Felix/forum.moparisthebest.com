    <title>Unbiased debate and discussion on religion and its God(s)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unbiased-debate-and-discussion-on-religion-and-its-god-s/225922</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been thinking this over for a few days now. Myself being a Catholic/Christian, I came here to have an open - [b]unbiased[/b] - discussion on the topic of: religion. By being unbiased, I mean to have an open opinion about whatever you are making a point on, and to be able to back that point up using fact.

Can you prove God/Jesus/religion is real?
Can you prove God/Jesus/religion is fake?

I want to hear what you guys have to say about those two questions. Can you even answer them? If so, let&#39;s hear it. Otherwise, [b]I don&#39;t want to see any crap related to biased remarks on how religion is complete fiction or on how religion is 100% real.[/b] That is only, of course, if you cannot back up your claim with decent proof or fact.

Here&#39;s my side of the story:

Take a look at the [i]Ten Commandments.[/i] They were supposedly written by God and given to Moses. But, after thinking about the Ten Commandments for quite some time, I came to a conclusion or two.

[quote=&quot;Wikipedia(Passage_From_Bible)&quot;]17 You shall not covet your neighbour’s house; you shall not covet your neighbour’s wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbour.[/quote]
What is this? [i]You shall not covet your neighbour&#39;s [u]male or female slave.[/i] According to an [url=http://dictionary.com]Online Dictionary[/url], to covet means to have a wrongful desire for. So if I&#39;m interpreting this correctly, then [b]God is telling us to not desire our neighbour&#39;s slave(s)?[/b] Wait a minute... doesn&#39;t God/Jesus/etc frown upon slavery? Doesn&#39;t He discourage it? Wasn&#39;t He the one who said all man was created equal? Because if I&#39;m correct, then God is saying that to have a slave would not be against Him or His laws. Apparently He is telling us it is OKAY as long as we don&#39;t have a wrongful desire for our neighbour&#39;s slave. Odd, isn&#39;t it?

Next up, if God is our... well, God, then wouldn&#39;t that mean we are His slaves? Doesn&#39;t that mean we must listen to him one hundred percent of the time, and that we must obey His every command? If so, then why is He contradicting himself? Last time I checked, He believed in free will.

According to some interpretations of the Ten Commandments, one of those laws tell us NOT to swear. But according to our society and our way of life, these &quot;swear words&quot; were thought of/created AFTER these commandments were written. If you would think about that for just a minute, you would realize it doesn&#39;t make any sense. How can God create a law telling us not to swear before we even create these swears he talks about? 

&lt;blockquote&gt;3 Do not have any other gods before me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Wait a second. [i]Do not have any other gods before me.[/i] Doesn&#39;t this mean that there ARE infact other gods out there? If so, does that not mean that the Christian God is not the only &#39;heavenly father&#39; out there, and that He did not create the Earth/Galaxy/Life Himself?

[b]If God created us, and told us to behave nicely and to not murder, steal, disrespect our family, and disrespect our friends, why did he gave us the emotions and ability to do so?[/b] If he truely wanted to do so in the first place, couldn&#39;t he just get rid of our ability to do those things rather than to tell us to? It&#39;d make more sense to me, to be honest. 

Why are there so many religions out in the world if according to God, we already know who created us and who is in charge? Shouldn&#39;t we all be bowing down to the one and only God, [b]rather than continuously inventing new religions and new Gods/beliefs to believe in?[/b] If you think about this, you could come to a quick and easy conclusion that religion was a simple, let&#39;s say [i]&quot;invention&quot;[/i], created by somebody earlier in time as a way to distract us. Not in a bad way, but the intention must have been to bring peace and balance to the world. By creating religion and so on, there would be a strong chance people would believe in [i]&quot;the greater good&quot;[/i] on a daily basis, creating a nice, happy world.

Now that I&#39;m done, I want to hear what you guys have to say. Remember, no garbage. Keep it clean, and let&#39;s hear YOUR side of the story.</description>

              <p>Debate w/ Taharok on MSN (code tags due to no scroll in quote tags)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">(1:03:44 PM) TeleNubby: 17 You shall not covet your neighbour’s house; you shall not covet your neighbour’s wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbour.
(1:03:46 PM) Taharok: i can spend hours doing this stuff
(1:03:48 PM) TeleNubby: thats part of ten commandments, k
(1:03:51 PM) Taharok: ofc
(1:03:52 PM) TeleNubby: What is this? You shall not covet your neighbour's male or female slave. According to an Online Dictionary, to covet means to have a wrongful desire for. So if I'm interpreting this correctly, then God is telling us to not desire our neighbour's slave(s)? Wait a minute... doesn't God/Jesus/etc frown upon slavery? Doesn't He discourage it? Wasn't He the one who said all man was created equal? Because if I'm correct, then God is saying that to have a slave would not be against Him or His laws. Apparently He is telling us it is OKAY as long as we don't have a wrongful desire for our neighbour's slave. Odd, isn't it?
(1:03:53 PM) TeleNubby: now read that
(1:03:57 PM) TeleNubby: and thats all
(1:04:10 PM) Taharok: first question, no to an extent
(1:04:17 PM) Taharok: if slavery does not hurt someone else's rights
(1:04:22 PM) Taharok: it's not wrong
(1:04:27 PM) Taharok: he does not discourage it
(1:04:32 PM) Taharok: there are no passages saying he does
(1:04:38 PM) Taharok: abuse of slave is wrong in one form of another though
(1:04:45 PM) Taharok: all men are created equal
(1:04:49 PM) TeleNubby: so i can go get me a slave and its all good?
(1:04:54 PM) Taharok: but slavery does not have to be a master-servant hierarchy
(1:05:04 PM) Taharok: depends how you look at it
(1:05:07 PM) Taharok: the understanding could also be
(1:05:10 PM) Taharok: that IF we have slaves
(1:05:13 PM) Taharok: thus could be wrong
(1:05:18 PM) Taharok: even if God does not agree with slavery
(1:05:31 PM) Taharok: that commandment just says 'Do not covet'
(1:05:38 PM) Taharok: it has nothing about God's personal feelings on slavery
(1:05:43 PM) Taharok: we have a freewill
(1:05:48 PM) Taharok: thats a freewill to do wrong
(1:05:54 PM) Taharok: we could have slaves, being against what he wants (if it is)
(1:05:59 PM) Taharok: but that does not contradict that commandment
(1:06:01 PM) TeleNubby: if hes saying our neighbour can have a slave, hes saying that its OKAY as long as we dont covet him/her
(1:06:02 PM) TeleNubby: slav·er·y  n.    pl. slav·er·ies 
  The state of one bound in servitude as the property of a slaveholder or household. The practice of owning slaves. A mode of production in which slaves constitute the principal work force.   The condition of being subject or addicted to a specified influence. A condition of hard work and subjection: wage slavery. 
(1:06:04 PM) Taharok: if that's where you're coming from
(1:06:17 PM) Taharok: nope
(1:06:21 PM) Taharok: he didnt say it was okay
(1:06:22 PM) Taharok: anyway
(1:06:27 PM) Taharok: i dunt like ur version of the commandment
(1:06:30 PM) Taharok: i like Luther's better
(1:06:31 PM) Taharok: one sec
(1:06:34 PM) TeleNubby: its the version thats in the bible omg
(1:06:52 PM) Taharok: yes
(1:06:54 PM) Taharok: but Luther explains it
(1:06:58 PM) Taharok: perhaps it'll answer your questions
(1:07:06 PM) TeleNubby: wait
(1:07:07 PM) TeleNubby: read this
(1:07:13 PM) Taharok: okay
(1:07:14 PM) Taharok: covet is
(1:07:18 PM) Taharok: commandments 9 and 10
(1:08:07 PM) TeleNubby: "Remember the Sabbath day, and keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work. But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God; you shall not do any work - you, your son or your daughter, YOUR MALE OR FEMALE SLAVE, your livestock, or the alien resident in your towns..."
(1:08:18 PM) TeleNubby: Exodus 20:8 straight from the Bible, just typed it out
(1:08:49 PM) Taharok: listen
(1:08:53 PM) Taharok: i have a solution to this
(1:08:57 PM) Taharok: the bible
(1:09:02 PM) Taharok: depending on specific translations
(1:09:06 PM) Taharok: has old fashioned english
(1:09:10 PM) Taharok: in a certain sense
(1:09:11 PM) Taharok: now
(1:09:22 PM) Taharok: you are saying God contradicts himself in the 9th or 10th commandments
(1:09:25 PM) Taharok: both being for coveting
(1:09:33 PM) Taharok: here is the 9th command and luther's explanation to it:
(1:09:34 PM) Taharok: 

The Ninth Commandment



You shall not covet your neighbor's house.



What does this mean?



We should fear and love god that we do not scheme to get our neighbor's inheritance or house, or obtain it by a show of right, but do all we can to help him keep it.
(1:09:40 PM) Taharok: you see
(1:09:46 PM) Taharok: it has nothing to do with slaves
(1:09:51 PM) Taharok: it refers to mere property
(1:09:56 PM) Taharok: also
(1:09:57 PM) TeleNubby: so now slaves are property
(1:09:57 PM) Taharok: it can mean workers
(1:09:58 PM) TeleNubby: i see..
(1:10:00 PM) Taharok: no
(1:10:05 PM) Taharok: slaves refer to workers
(1:10:12 PM) TeleNubby: slaves != workers in ANY sense
(1:10:16 PM) Taharok: the Bible mostly is written in an example like sense
(1:10:18 PM) Taharok: like a parable
(1:10:27 PM) Taharok: you are looking at it literally
(1:10:30 PM) TeleNubby: i still stand by my opinion (using the catholic Bible)
(1:10:30 PM) Taharok: look at it figuratively
(1:10:35 PM) Taharok: yes well
(1:10:41 PM) Taharok: i am not liking catholics atm
(1:10:41 PM) TeleNubby: yours wasnt from the bible
(1:10:46 PM) Taharok: because all i meet are trying to prove it wrong
(1:10:56 PM) TeleNubby: i havent even thought about proving it wrong until a few days ago
(1:10:57 PM) Taharok: ill get my bible out then
(1:10:57 PM) Taharok: sec
(1:10:57 PM) TeleNubby: when i read that
(1:11:28 PM) Taharok: okay
(1:11:32 PM) Taharok: i have an NIV Bible
(1:11:34 PM) Taharok: that stands for
(1:11:37 PM) Taharok: New International Version
(1:11:43 PM) Taharok: it was a carefully structured Bible
(1:11:47 PM) Taharok: based on thousand-year old manuscripts
(1:11:53 PM) Taharok: and is based on the King James Version Bible
(1:11:58 PM) Taharok: which I think most catholics use
(1:11:59 PM) TeleNubby: NIV reminds me of HIV.. but continue
(1:12:07 PM) Taharok: now
(1:12:16 PM) Taharok: the NIV Bible
(1:12:24 PM) Taharok: makes the King James version more understandable to modern day
(1:12:27 PM) Taharok: a lot easier to understand
(1:12:31 PM) Taharok: in this compiled bible
(1:12:41 PM) Taharok: in Exodus Chapter 20:17
(1:12:42 PM) Taharok: it says
(1:13:12 PM) TeleNubby: 17 You shall not covet your neighbour’s house; you shall not covet your neighbour’s wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbour.
(1:13:27 PM) Taharok: "You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox or his donkey, or anything that belonds to your neighbor.
(1:13:41 PM) Taharok: how different is that?
(1:13:42 PM) Taharok: barely
(1:13:46 PM) Taharok: male and female slave
(1:13:48 PM) Taharok: in that sense
(1:13:53 PM) Taharok: represents manservant and maidservant
(1:13:55 PM) Taharok: MAIDservant
(1:13:58 PM) Taharok: well that sounds like a main
(1:14:02 PM) Taharok: which leads us to hired workers
(1:14:08 PM) Taharok: a slave simply represents a helping hand
(1:14:12 PM) Taharok: whether by free or by paid
(1:14:26 PM) TeleNubby: either that, or the fact that the whoever wrote that version decided to switch that commandment up a little
(1:14:37 PM) TeleNubby: but the ORIGINAL TEN COMMANDMENTS GIVEN BY _GOD_ TO MOSES.. states...
(1:14:39 PM) TeleNubby: 17 You shall not covet your neighbour’s house; you shall not covet your neighbour’s wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbour.
(1:14:41 PM) TeleNubby: kthx
(1:14:50 PM) Taharok: wrong
(1:14:55 PM) Taharok: you think thats the perfect version?
(1:15:01 PM) Taharok: the commands that were given were in Hebrew
(1:15:04 PM) TeleNubby: no but its the _earliest_ ANYbody has
(1:15:12 PM) Taharok: sounds like you have the King James version
(1:15:15 PM) Taharok: there are tons of bibles out there
(1:15:16 PM) Taharok: example
(1:15:26 PM) Taharok: http://www.biblegateway.com/
(1:15:31 PM) TeleNubby: fine alright
(1:15:32 PM) TeleNubby: BUT
(1:15:36 PM) Taharok: over 100 bibles and 50 languages
(1:15:38 PM) TeleNubby: i still stand by my opinion
(1:15:43 PM) TeleNubby: as worker and slave are two different things
(1:15:46 PM) TeleNubby: and ppl back then knew that oo
(1:15:47 PM) TeleNubby: too*
(1:16:21 PM) Taharok: how about this
(1:16:22 PM) Taharok: http://eastonsbibledictionary.com/s/slave.htm
(1:16:34 PM) Taharok: website made by people who spend their entire lives in this
(1:16:42 PM) Taharok: and probably know the original Hebrew of the ten commandments
(1:16:49 PM) Taharok: so they can understand what was written directly
(1:16:51 PM) Taharok: and make a definition for it
(1:17:00 PM) Taharok: The Hebrew and Greek words for slave are usually rendered simply "servant," "bondman," or "bondservant." 
(1:17:06 PM) Taharok: if that doesn't convince you
(1:17:08 PM) Taharok: i dont see what can
(1:17:25 PM) TeleNubby: what about "slavery"
(1:17:36 PM) Taharok: they never used slavery
(1:17:38 PM) Taharok: they used slaves
(1:17:57 PM) TeleNubby: coulve sworn i said it in the bible
(1:17:58 PM) TeleNubby: sec
(1:18:00 PM) TeleNubby: it*
(1:18:37 PM) TeleNubby: "I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery; you shall have no other gods before me"
(1:18:43 PM) TeleNubby: SO
(1:18:44 PM) Taharok: yes
(1:18:48 PM) Taharok: Israel was slaves of Egypt
(1:18:52 PM) Taharok: against God's judgement in fact
(1:18:57 PM) TeleNubby: if they used slavery, then slave most likely corresponds with that "slavery"
(1:19:00 PM) Taharok: i can tell u the entire story if you'd like
(1:19:04 PM) Taharok: yes
(1:19:10 PM) Taharok: Israel is God's chosen people
(1:19:13 PM) Taharok: they were slaves of Egypt
(1:19:16 PM) Taharok: and God freed them
(1:19:22 PM) Taharok: that proves he doesn't like slavery Mark
(1:19:39 PM) TeleNubby: sure doesnt seem like it in passage 17
(1:19:49 PM) TeleNubby: ok wait
(1:19:51 PM) TeleNubby: explain this then, please
(1:19:56 PM) TeleNubby: Remembering incest is against the Christian religion 
(1:20:01 PM) TeleNubby: 
The first two people created, Adam and Eve. They are the great grand parents of all of us right? So lets see how this goes.

(1:20:04 PM) TeleNubby: 
then what happens? Do the children have sex with each other incestually? 
(1:20:09 PM) Taharok: well
(1:20:15 PM) Taharok: God had to have allowed this to happen
(1:20:20 PM) Taharok: the Bible isn't entirely specific
(1:20:25 PM) Taharok: they were the first humans
(1:20:35 PM) Taharok: but that doesnt mean God didn't make other humans from the dust either
(1:20:38 PM) TeleNubby: if you're gonna start saying there were "exceptions", then i rly dont wna hear it
(1:20:42 PM) Taharok: no
(1:20:43 PM) Taharok: im not
(1:20:47 PM) Taharok: in the beginning
(1:20:52 PM) Taharok: humans could live exceptionally longer
(1:20:57 PM) Taharok: and I can tell you the science behind it as well
(1:20:59 PM) Taharok: but
(1:21:06 PM) Taharok: God had to have let them have sex with each other
(1:21:09 PM) Taharok: though
(1:21:15 PM) Taharok: eventually, he banned this concept
(1:21:19 PM) Taharok: and it was wrong to do eventually
(1:21:25 PM) Taharok: but
(1:21:30 PM) Taharok: God doesn't bend nature
(1:21:32 PM) Taharok: he manipulates it
(1:21:33 PM) TeleNubby: thats almost like saying "exception"
(1:21:37 PM) Taharok: but it's not
(1:21:39 PM) Taharok: one sec
(1:22:49 PM) Taharok: well
(1:22:52 PM) Taharok: it must be some time after Noah
(1:23:07 PM) TeleNubby: okay then..
(1:23:08 PM) TeleNubby: Was in Science today searching up other religions creation theories.
And just, with how many there are, for each culture, it makes it even clearer to me that God is just a story.

The Christian belief of creation is just another creation theory, like all the rest.
What makes this one any different from everyone elses?
(1:23:13 PM) TeleNubby: a post by Kane.
(1:23:48 PM) Taharok: no
(1:23:50 PM) Taharok: not a theory
(1:23:55 PM) Taharok: easily proven against
(1:24:02 PM) Taharok: there are many many many signs of evidence of a 6-day creation
(1:24:05 PM) Taharok: a massive flood
(1:24:06 PM) Taharok: you name it
(1:24:09 PM) TeleNubby: i mainly meant this part
(1:24:09 PM) TeleNubby: And just, with how many there are, for each culture, it makes it even clearer to me that God is just a story.
(1:24:17 PM) Taharok: well
(1:24:21 PM) Taharok: there are many theories
(1:24:27 PM) Taharok: but its not a theory in the case of Christianity
(1:24:28 PM) Taharok: its a religion
(1:24:34 PM) Taharok: and its the only religion of its kind
(1:24:44 PM) Taharok: the only religion where the god of worship saves you
(1:24:48 PM) Taharok: and you dont need to do anything on your own
(1:24:53 PM) Taharok: plus
(1:25:01 PM) Taharok: 30% of the world is Christians alone
(1:25:11 PM) Taharok: it has always been the most popular religion since its creation
(1:25:20 PM) Taharok: in around 3 AD
(1:25:27 PM) Taharok: (since our calendar is off about 3 years)</code></pre>

              <p>[quote=“ThAt0n36Uy, post:4, topic:225922”][quote]Quote from: Wikipedia(Passage_From_Bible)</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>17 You shall not covet your neighbour’s house; you shall not covet your neighbour’s wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbour.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>What is this? You shall not covet your neighbour’s male or female slave. According to an Online Dictionary, to covet means to have a wrongful desire for. So if I’m interpreting this correctly, then God is telling us to not desire our neighbour’s slave(s)? Wait a minute… doesn’t God/Jesus/etc frown upon slavery? Doesn’t He discourage it? Wasn’t He the one who said all man was created equal? Because if I’m correct, then God is saying that to have a slave would not be against Him or His laws. Apparently He is telling us it is OKAY as long as we don’t have a wrongful desire for our neighbour’s slave. Odd, isn’t it?[/quote]</p>
<p>The human beings who wrote the texts, and the human beings who collaboratively pieced the Bible together could have made mistakes. Misinterpretation or missing texts. I’m not saying that, that doesn’t make this law right. But you should have understanding that these people could have been slave owners, etc. They might’ve added that in. I don’t understand it, nor do I pretend to understand it.[/quote]That shouldn’t matter. And IIRC, slave owners did not write the Bible. Instead, they were “monks” who spent their lives writing copies of the bible. Anyways, the Ten Commandments were supposedly given to Moses by God, and shouldn’t have changed as the years went by. Not to mention, in Exodus Chapter 20 of the Bible (the Ten Commandments), slavery is mentioned trice, in a way which means it is OK to practice it.</p>

People who are incapable of thinking for themselves simply believe what they are told by various religious bodies.<br>
Humans have a need to explain everything, and most people can’t overcome that, so they become religious.<br>
I call myself an agnostic atheist (or an atheistic agnosticist), as I don’t believe there is a deity or supernatural power, and that humans just aren’t capable of understanding everything.</p>

<p>Again, God gave us complete freedom, the freedom to make choices for one. I can make the choice to accept God as my savior, etc. Or I can not, people created other religions, or “found” if you will. And people may choose to follow that religion.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Christianity is not the first religion. Egypts had their religions. Heck, native Americans never even heard of anything related to Christianity.</p>
<p>Think about this: why didn’t anyone in the bible mention Neanderthalers? Dinosaurs? You can say they weren’t that important. But something like a Tyrannosaurus rex storming towards you must’ve been quite impressive. Neanderthalers looked a lot like humans, they couldn’t have missed them either. Also look up about Homo sapiens idaltu.</p>
<p>Some people talk about people originating from monkeys. Humans belong to Hominini.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 Wikipedia:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Hominini is the tribe of Homininae that comprises humans (Homo), chimpanzees (Pan), and their extinct ancestors. Members of the tribe are called hominins (cf. Hominidae, “hominids”). The subtribe Hominina is the “human” branch, including genus Homo and its close relatives, but not Pan.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You already see that chimpanzees (monkeys) are related to humans. What I’m saying here is that we actually are family of monkeys (as dogs are family of wolfs and cats are family of tigers).</p>
<p>I still stand by my theory that religions had two uses through time:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In prehistoric times humans were stupid compared to humans now. They didn’t understand what caused things as lightning, stars, the sun, the moon, etc… All they knew was that it came from the sky. It was a ‘higher’ power, in the true meaning of the word. It was scary that trees close to you somehow fell down after it got hit by lightning. As they didn’t travel much, they only saw this things happen close to them, so they thought it was a punishment to them. Weren’t you scared of lightning as a kid? As you grew older you got to understand what caused lightning; they didn’t know that. You can still see this in a lot of African and American tribes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People don’t always listen to their leaders. Knowing that a god will punish them will make them listen to you. This is one of the reasons religious leaders had much power in the late dark ages. Religion was used to control the crowd. With gods by their side kings had power. Normal people couldn’t read, so they would believe anything written in books that were supposedly written by people who met the son of god. Even if it wasn’t written in religious books, how would they know? A good example is people paying loads of money to the church to make priests do a good word for them. This is why Protestants are separated from Catholics.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>What is this? You shall not covet your neighbour’s male or female slave. According to an Online Dictionary, to covet means to have a wrongful desire for. So if I’m interpreting this correctly, then God is telling us to not desire our neighbour’s slave(s)? Wait a minute… doesn’t God/Jesus/etc frown upon slavery? Doesn’t He discourage it? Wasn’t He the one who said all man was created equal? Because if I’m correct, then God is saying that to have a slave would not be against Him or His laws.

<p>The human beings who wrote the texts, and the human beings who collaboratively pieced the Bible together could have made mistakes. Misinterpretation or missing texts.

Wait a second. Do not have any other gods before me. Doesn’t this mean that there ARE infact other gods out there? If so, does that not mean that the Christian God is not the only ‘heavenly father’ out there, and that He did not create the Earth/Galaxy/Life Himself?[/quote]</p>

              <p>I’ve been thinking this over for a few days now. Myself being a Catholic/Christian, I came here to have an open - <span class="bbcode-b">unbiased</span> - discussion on the topic of: religion. By being unbiased, I mean to have an open opinion about whatever you are making a point on, and to be able to back that point up using fact.</p>
<p>Can you prove God/Jesus/religion is real?<br>
Can you prove God/Jesus/religion is fake?</p>
<p>I want to hear what you guys have to say about those two questions. Can you even answer them? If so, let’s hear it. Otherwise, <span class="bbcode-b">I don’t want to see any crap related to biased remarks on how religion is complete fiction or on how religion is 100% real.</span> That is only, of course, if you cannot back up your claim with decent proof or fact.</p>
<p>Here’s my side of the story:</p>
<p>Take a look at the <span class="bbcode-i">Ten Commandments.</span> They were supposedly written by God and given to Moses. But, after thinking about the Ten Commandments for quite some time, I came to a conclusion or two.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 Wikipedia(Passage_From_Bible):</div>
<blockquote>
<p>17 You shall not covet your neighbour’s house; you shall not covet your neighbour’s wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbour.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>What is this? <span class="bbcode-i">You shall not covet your neighbour’s [u]male or female slave.</span> According to an <a href="http://dictionary.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Online Dictionary</a>, to covet means to have a wrongful desire for.

Apparently He is telling us it is OKAY as long as we don’t have a wrongful desire for our neighbour’s slave. Odd, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Next up, if God is our… well, God, then wouldn’t that mean we are His slaves? Doesn’t that mean we must listen to him one hundred percent of the time, and that we must obey His every command? If so, then why is He contradicting himself? Last time I checked, He believed in free will.</p>
<p>According to some interpretations of the Ten Commandments, one of those laws tell us NOT to swear. But according to our society and our way of life, these “swear words” were thought of/created AFTER these commandments were written. If you would think about that for just a minute, you would realize it doesn’t make any sense. How can God create a law telling us not to swear before we even create these swears he talks about?</p>
<blockquote>3 Do not have any other gods before me.</blockquote>
Wait a second. [i]Do not have any other gods before me.[/i] Doesn't this mean that there ARE infact other gods out there? If so, does that not mean that the Christian God is not the only 'heavenly father' out there, and that He did not create the Earth/Galaxy/Life Himself?

<p>Now that I’m done, I want to hear what you guys have to say. Remember, no garbage. Keep it clean, and let’s hear YOUR side of the story.</p>
