    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/halo-2-glitches/168619</link>
    <description>ok there are a couple so listen


1.FLYING SCORPEIN:ok the easiest place to do this one is COAGULATION in multiplayer...get 2 scorpien tanks drive one against a wall and keep going till it flips...then drive the other on top of it...then get out go to the bottom one and flip it if done correctly the top tank should thrust into the air a MILLION MILES AWAY and come crashing down sometimes it bounces unrelisticly

2.FAKKEYY:get 2 players equip one with the saber then have the unnequiped one jump and the saber one do the thrust at him RIGHT after u do the thrust hit b before u hit him (its a fake shot u wont att)

3.FLYING PLAYER:get a banshee best done with 2-3 player but possible by urself flip the banshee stand on the wing closest to the ground get 2 ppl to stand on either side of u but behind u far away and shoot at the other wing simultaniously (at the same time) the one guy on the wing shouold fly to the top of the map ad hopefully escape into blackness.

4.SCARAB GUN: MUST BE DONE ON ADVANCEDD!!! EASY on 2 players co-op campagin DESTROY EVERYTHING even the marines leave only 1 banshee alive make sure theres a bad guy in it and its circleing have player 1 go in the tunnel and wipe out everything till the end of the tunnel then go back player 2 and player 1 would lure the banshee in the tunnel and out the other end RIGHT when it says &quot;LOADING: PLEASE WAIT&quot; board the banshee or else itll disappear then ride to the top of the tower and the gun should be on a cone with a &quot;!&quot; on it 

GUN STATS: flash shots (SUPER FASTTT!!) if u shoot it at the ground u die it gets boring after like 5 mins of using it have fun and enjoy THERE ARE MANY MORE GLITCHES THAT I DO NOT KNOW OF THESE ARE NOT all of them</description>

              <p>You missed the soccer ball…when your flying to get the scarab gun, theres a huge tower thats half blown open, if you fly into it you’ll find a giant soccer ball, if you push it down onto the street you can play Warthog soccer. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Also you don’t have to do the scarb gun on advanced…I did it on my second try…? On normal.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
You also missed sword canceling.</p>
<p>Have one player climb in the passenger seat of the warthog with a sword.</p>
<p>Have another player get in a banshee and go up right next to the person in the Warthog.</p>
<p>Have the person in the warthog slash the banshee a couple times.</p>
<p>While the person is still in the warthog have the banshee fly away, when the person in the warthog climbs out he’ll fly through the air after the banshee.</p>
<p>EditEdit:<br>
lol…<br>
What about all the skulls…?</p>
