    <title>Player updating distance/region/chunks questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-updating-distance-region-chunks-questions/555061</link>
    <description>Trying to write an event driven updating system (sort of). The main idea is to avoid looping through the server&#39;s connected player list.

To be honest I don&#39;t even know what I&#39;m asking or what it is.

Basically, what is a region/chunk in Runescape?
Which players do you update (relative to our player)? What distance?

I have looked into existing servers but none of them do what I want to do. They all basically loop through the local player list (stored on the player), check the distance, if valid -&gt; update, if not -&gt; remove. Then they loop through the full server player list and add all the players to the local player list if they&#39;re within range. This is essentially what I&#39;m trying to avoid.

Some clarification is appreciated.</description>

              <p>I think I’m just going to get this system working and then experiment with the distances. The client does indeed send a packet upon region changing (and another upon finishing loading the new region). So upon receiving this packet, the server places the player in his new region.</p>
<p>Here’s how I think of doing it:</p>
<p>[ul][li] Since a region is 32x32 tiles, the player updates all the players in his current region, no matter what[/li]<br>
[li] Depending on the chunk (=segment) of the current region the player is in, the player will also load players in chunks of neighbouring regions[/li][/ul]</p>

<p>So imagine that our player is right at the border of his current region, do we start loading players from the neighbouring region?</p>

</aside>
<p>Only if that player’s X/Y/Z are within the your visible region.</p>
<p>Like if you’re standing right next to the “black wall” right before the map loads the new region, you’d only update the players that are between that wall and the opposing end of it about 3 segments away.<br>
Personally I’ve never wrote a system for this… But I <span class="bbcode-i">believe</span> when you load a new region the client sends a packet to the server. You could capture the player’s X/Y at that point then those values plus/minus (8 * 4)  (You should be centered in the region on load. so it’s half) would be the max distance the player could see before the region would reload.</p>
<p>So if I logged in at X: 64, y: 64, Z: 0, I’d be able to see from X: 32, Y: 32, Z: 0 to X: 96, Y: 96, Z: 0 (Height is semi-irrelevant here as you’d only update ones on your height level iirc) before reloading. That means any player within those tiles, should be updated.</p>
<p>(Unless I’ve got a completely wrong understanding on how this works).</p>
<p>I er, hope that helps.</p>

It should be yes.<br>
And only a max of 255 players.</p>
