    <description>[left][shadow=black,left][b][i][u]~MortalPK[/u][/i][/b][/shadow][/left]
[left]Hello, This is my first guide, as I am new to coding 508 private servers.
This guide is not difficult, it is mostly just changing a few numbers/words and C&amp;P.[/left]
[u]1.Making Yourself Staff[/u]

[u]2.Changing the Location of an NPC[/u]

[u]3.Changing Bonuses of Items[/u]

[u]4.Changing the ::starter[/u]

[u]5.Changing the Messages that Appear on Login
[/u]

[b][i][u]~Making Yourself Owner/Admin~[/u][/i][/b][left]Go to &quot;Bin/Data/Characters/Mainsave&quot;[/left]
[left]Then find and open then account you want to give rights to. 
[/left]
[left][b]THIS IS IMPORTANT![/b] Make sure that you use [b][i][u]Wordpad[/u][/i][/b] not [b]Notepad[/b].[/left]Find where it says Rights, and change it to 3 for Owner, 2 for Admin, 1 for Mod, and 0 for Nothing.
Save the file, and you&#39;re done. Relog if you&#39;re online, and you will have your Rights.

[i][b][u]2.~Changing the location of an NPC~[/u][/b][/i]
Now that you&#39;re the owner, you may use ::coords.
Using ::coords will tell you where in your server you are, and will be used. First,
Find the NPC in your server that you want to move, and examine it. It should say &quot;Npc #&quot;
The # is the number of the NPC after you examine it. Then, goto &quot;Bin/Data/Npcs/NpcSpawn.cfg
When you open it, you should see  [code]spawn    =    #    x    x    0    0    0    0    0   &quot;Description&quot;[/code] many times.
The First number is the NPC number, and the 2 after it are its coords. These Coords are where the NPC is right now, so if you change those Co-ords, it will change the location of the NPC.
Find the NPC that you got from examining.
Remember before where you used ::coords? Well after you have the place where you want your NPC to be, take the 2 numbers you got from ::coords, and replace them with the 2 numbers labeled &quot;X&quot; above.

[i][b]3.~Changing the Bonuses of an item~[/b][/i][left]Go to &quot;bin/data/item/items.cfg&quot;
Open the items.cfg, and then, push CTRL+F and put in the Items code, or type in the items name so you can find it easier.
The numbers that you see after the item are the Price, and the Stats. The first 3 numbers are for price, so you only want to modify the others. So only modify the numbers after the first 3 and save &#39;n compile. 
[/left]
[b][i][u]4.~Changing the ::starter~[/u][/i][/b][left]Like most servers, there is a ::Starter. This commands gives a new user the starter pack to start playing the server.[/left]
[left]Some sources some with a pre-made ::Starter, and most people don&#39;t like what&#39;s already there.[/left]
[left]To change it, go to &quot;src/palidino76/rs2/io/packets/commands.java[/left]
[left]Then push CTRL+F and type in starter. then you should see this:[/left]
[left][code]            if (cmd[0].equals(&quot;starter&quot;) &amp;&amp; p.starter == 0) {
[/code]Once you have this there will be this under it:[/left]
[left][code]Engine.playerItems.addItem(p, x, x);[/code][/left]
[left]This is saying that when you type in ::Starter, it will give you that item.[/left]
[left]The First &quot;X&quot; is the item number which is given, such as &quot;995&quot; for Coins.[/left]
[left]The Second &quot;X&quot; is for The amount of the item. 
[/left]
[left]So say you want the starter to give you 10 Coins, you would put:[/left]
[left][code] Engine.playerItems.addItem(p, 995, 10);[/code][/left]
[left]So the entire Starter would be:[/left]
[left][code]if (cmd[0].equals(&quot;starter&quot;) &amp;&amp; p.starter == 0) {
Engine.playerItems.addItem(p, 995, 10); [/code][/left]
[left]Say you wanted  to add another item, such as a whip.[/left]
[left]All you need to do is put another code under the one above, like this:[/left]
[left][code]if (cmd[0].equals(&quot;starter&quot;) &amp;&amp; p.starter == 0) {
Engine.playerItems.addItem(p, 995, 10);
Engine.playerItems.addItem(p, 4151, 1):[/code][/left]
[left]This would give you both, the 10 coins, and a whip.[/left][b]
[i][u]5.~Changing the Messages given on Login~[/u][/i]
[/b][left]When you login to a server, usually there is a message which says something like &quot;Welcome to ExampleScape!&quot;[/left]
[left]These are messages which are sent to every player that logs in.[/left]
[left]To change these, go to &quot;src/palidino76/rs2/io/Login.JAVA&quot;[/left]
[left]Then hit CTRL+F and Search for:[/left]
[left][code]                p.runEnergyUpdateReq = true;[/code][/left]
[left]Then, right under that should be:[/left]
[left][code]            p.frames.sendMessage(p,[/code][/left]
[left]These are the Messages Received upon login.[/left]
[left]For example:[/left]
[left][code]            p.frames.sendMessage(p, &quot;Example.&quot;);[/code][/left]To have more than one, just put:
[code]            p.frames.sendMessage(p, &quot;Example.&quot;);
            p.frames.sendMessage(p, &quot;Example&quot;);[/code]
Both messages will be sent to any user upon login. You may put what ever you&#39;d like into the box where it says &quot;example.&quot;
If you have Questions, Comments, Errors from codes, or found any mistake I made, Please, post below.
Thank you for taking you time for reading this guide, and hope you good. :)
