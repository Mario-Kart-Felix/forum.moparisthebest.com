    <title>Problems making script work without me being there</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problems-making-script-work-without-me-being-there/603</link>
    <description>Well I had read some of the codes and tried the auto fighter script...however all I could do was move my mouse to turn off the chat entirely and auto right click for me. Other than that it got my mouse stuck shaking in the upper left corner of my screen. I had chosen the client window with the cross hair, I selected the grey walkway color with the color picker, I had told the script to run...but i doesn&#39;t do much good... 

My next problem is there are many good scripts on this forum but ppl don&#39;t post the scripts so how do you get it?

k now I got the script and I followed the instructions but....my cursor just runs in circles and right clicks random things =\

Thx so much for your help</description>
