    <description>[u][b]Requirements[/b][/u]

[ol][li]Level 30 on the North America server[/li]
[li]Know how to play decently, not based on ELO (simply because that is based too much on other people)[/li]
[li]Own at least 8 champions (+ the free ones, to give you 16+)[/li]
[li]Be very good at at least one specific role in the current meta[/li][/ol]


If you are interested, leave a message with the role you are interested in. Remember, skill a lot of the time in ranked teams is based more on your role and knowing your part than skills with specific champions. If you can only play one champion well for your role, don&#39;t apply for that one :P

Name TBD, if we can even find enough people :P

I&#39;ll start off. I am interested in support, mid, or ad carry bottom. I specialize in support and mid, but I find ad carry fun as well.
