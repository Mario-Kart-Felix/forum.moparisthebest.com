    <title>The Great RSPS - Please Read!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-great-rsps-please-read/547586</link>
    <description>Hey guys, sorry for the inactivity.
I have this brilliant (maybe) suggestion. We make RS EXACTLY like a specific time (Pre-EOC/2007/Anything else)

[size=14pt][b]How?[/b][/size]

I dont know how to exactly explain it, but we start off with the best framework there is at the moment (apollo probably). Then, we host this web-server of some sort where EVERYONE who is illegible can make a contribution.

[size=14pt][b]What if someone tries to erase our work?[/b][/size]

We can get some sort of rollback feature, and everytime someone opens the files, it saves itself before someone types. Therefore, if someone for example named Tr0ll3r9000 decides to erase everything, we rollback to a specific time and there we go!

[size=14pt][b]What if the code is all wrong and/or non-efficient?[/b][/size]

I have the suggestion that it could go to trusted people to examine the code before it is implemented in and saved (ex:arham 4)

[size=14pt][b]Why should we do this?[/b][/size]

This will be very rewarding in ways like GAINING players to the rsps community, instead of rapidly losing right now. This would also be a fun activity, as some of us also can improve our programming skills from this. 

So, what do you guys think?</description>
