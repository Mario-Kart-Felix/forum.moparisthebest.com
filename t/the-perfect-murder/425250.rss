    <title>The perfect murder?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-perfect-murder/425250</link>
    <description>We all know that murder is bad, that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been taught since we were kids (well most of us) but there are definitely people out there that the would would benefit from being gone (KKK members, other murders). What do you think would happen if lets say I shot a KKK leader during one of his hate speeches and he died. I willingly put on handcuffs and admit that I am the one who shot and at the court case I say I am the one who shot him. What would happen? Would the basic legal system go with normal rules (30 to life for manslaughter) or would the jury find the killing just and my sentence would be low or non at all?

Now hold on, I know you think I&#39;m crazy that I would think the second answer would even be a possibility in this day and age, but think just to yourself. Is it really evil if the acts of evil are preformed on the evil itself? I&#39;ve seen cases before that people have point blank said they killed someone, but the person they killed was so hated/despised that the case was just dropped.

<p>I have no idea where you’re getting this “similarity” stuff from.
