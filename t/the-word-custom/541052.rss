    <title>The word &quot;Custom&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-word-custom/541052</link>
    <description>Hello, thank you for taking interest :)

So I&#39;ve been looking around for about a month now... I&#39;ve found the word &quot;custom&quot; (or rather.. &quot;Costum&quot;) pop up innumerable amount of times... 
Basically, it seems it all boils down to &quot;I have the most colourful same boring items&quot; and those people consider themselves the winners...

This thinking, the 1-dimensional way of thinking is also present in modern games made by large companies - they take a game, replace some textures and skins, change a couple of numbers, BAM battlefield 15 comes out.

This is horrible, because once the novelty of said coloured item fades, there&#39;s only you and the same boring whip, just painted green. If I painted my pc green, would it be any better? of course not... but hey it would be &quot;custom&quot; and for those who like the colour - green, they will get some happiness out of it. However, in private servers it rarely works... if ever, mainly because NOTHING IS RARE. I&#39;ve noticed this - badly managed servers will advertise (as someone said 3000) customs as content of infinite length... That is untrue, changing colour of something doesn&#39;t extend the interesting gameplay time; this of course would be avoided if someone had the understanding of what makes an item rare... if you get it when you log in - it is not rare. If you give someone 10000 arrows when they log in (arrows that sell for 100 each), there isn&#39;t a good economy.

This brings me to my point: 
Why do people NOT produce custom gameplay? Why try to recreate something that another server has done? Why try to re-create something runescape 3 already does? Why try to compete with other servers who claim to have &quot;flawless combat&quot;? Create custom gameplay, make it interesting, throw stories into it, make themed PVP (DayZ style survival island, start with nothing, deal with hunger and such - I am coding this. And I will succeed, and it will only be a MINIGAME, not the whole freakin server.) and maybe re-design something, like firemaking - That isn&#39;t so hard to re-design at all.

I&#39;ve been really frustrated and often shocked by the greed displayed by those who run horrible servers. If you look at the toplist, there&#39;s a server at the top of a certain list, which when you log into it... will tell you the ID&#39;s of the objects you click. Leeched or what? Why is it even there? Nobody will ever play it. And people have the balls to ask for donations to such servers.

I understand there are good servers out there, I also understand there are good coders out there; but I don&#39;t understand why the good coders don&#39;t get together and create something that will really blow everyones crap out of the water. As it stands, RSPS is the most boring place for someone to be. I made a server to create something different but it doesn&#39;t really see much spotlight anywhere; and I am okay with that. At least I know I tried doing something different and good, out of good will and not donations or votes.

Sorry about that... It was a bit of a rant after all...

Thank you very much for reading :)

<p>People have different opinions. Some people love more the 317 gameframe an some May like the 690 dark RS gameframe. Same applies to hitmarks and menus. That being said, why not create an efficient system that will give a choice? That’s what I did. But that’s not all. You said people lack of creativity, we’ll let me create a custom gameframe afterwards. I’ll design it and implement in a different way. And no, it won’t be a green 562 gameframe ‘custom’ version. I’ll actually think of new sprites. Anyway, in my opinion, you should always have a balance.<br>

That’s a bit harsh, another comment got deleted before which was of similar tone.</p>
<p>As I can see EVEN AFTER reading the post people fail to grasp the concept. I guess we could call it … “corruption by RSPS”? Ones image gets tained by insta-click PK nonsense with colourful items of the same kind.</p>

<p>great point</p>
<p>answer: because they can’t, all 90% of people do here is follow tutorials. literally if you took away every single rsps tutorial there would be almost no servers up because no one would know how to do shit lol</p>

              <p>I will address a couple of your points, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
<p>‘Custom’ items aren’t really a massive focus anymore I would say, it used to be since they were unknown to most people (how to add and incorporate them) now it’s just common knowledge.<br>
I think the RS formula is followed because it was successful, people want to spend their time and succeed not fail.<br>
‘Custom’ gameplay is harder to make since the scene as a whole seems to lack creativity, and most people know how to program and not how to model so that is an obvious bottleneck.<br>
Our decent programmers have long forgotten about the game (most are at university or employed and thus do not care anymore).</p>

              <p>Hello, thank you for taking interest <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>So I’ve been looking around for about a month now… I’ve found the word “custom” (or rather… “Costum”) pop up innumerable amount of times…<br>
Basically, it seems it all boils down to “I have the most colourful same boring items” and those people consider themselves the winners…</p>
<p>This thinking, the 1-dimensional way of thinking is also present in modern games made by large companies - they take a game, replace some textures and skins, change a couple of numbers, BAM battlefield 15 comes out.</p>
<p>This is horrible, because once the novelty of said coloured item fades, there’s only you and the same boring whip, just painted green. If I painted my pc green, would it be any better? of course not… but hey it would be “custom” and for those who like the colour - green, they will get some happiness out of it. However, in private servers it rarely works… if ever, mainly because NOTHING IS RARE. I’ve noticed this - badly managed servers will advertise (as someone said 3000) customs as content of infinite length… That is untrue, changing colour of something doesn’t extend the interesting gameplay time; this of course would be avoided if someone had the understanding of what makes an item rare… if you get it when you log in - it is not rare. If you give someone 10000 arrows when they log in (arrows that sell for 100 each), there isn’t a good economy.</p>
<p>This brings me to my point:<br>
Why do people NOT produce custom gameplay? Why try to recreate something that another server has done? Why try to re-create something runescape 3 already does? Why try to compete with other servers who claim to have “flawless combat”? Create custom gameplay, make it interesting, throw stories into it, make themed PVP (DayZ style survival island, start with nothing, deal with hunger and such - I am coding this. And I will succeed, and it will only be a MINIGAME, not the whole freakin server.) and maybe re-design something, like firemaking - That isn’t so hard to re-design at all.</p>
<p>I’ve been really frustrated and often shocked by the greed displayed by those who run horrible servers. If you look at the toplist, there’s a server at the top of a certain list, which when you log into it… will tell you the ID’s of the objects you click. Leeched or what? Why is it even there? Nobody will ever play it. And people have the balls to ask for donations to such servers.</p>
<p>I understand there are good servers out there, I also understand there are good coders out there; but I don’t understand why the good coders don’t get together and create something that will really blow everyones crap out of the water. As it stands, RSPS is the most boring place for someone to be. I made a server to create something different but it doesn’t really see much spotlight anywhere; and I am okay with that. At least I know I tried doing something different and good, out of good will and not donations or votes.</p>
<p>Sorry about that… It was a bit of a rant after all…</p>
<p>Thank you very much for reading <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
