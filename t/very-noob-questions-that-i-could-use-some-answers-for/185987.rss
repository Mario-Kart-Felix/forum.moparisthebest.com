    <title>VERY noob questions that I could use some answers for</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/very-noob-questions-that-i-could-use-some-answers-for/185987</link>
    <description>Hey evryone, I have some VERY noob questions that should be able to easily be answered. Please answer to the best of your ability. Thanks

1.	When ever I attempt to change the item sell/buy prices for shops and alching in the item.cfg 
the number that I put in is not what the shop sells/buys or gets alched for, only the number of
decimal places that I go out to.

2.	How do I spawn objects? Say I want to put a bank in my start area that is in a cave, how do I 
spawn a bank booth? This also goes for adding fences, bushes, PORTALS (NEED TO KNOW HOW TO)
and other objects.

3.	Where do I edit the emote buttons? In alot of servers I see that the emote buttons are turned into
commands, such as Bank, 3rd age, barrows, home etc... How do I do this?

4.	How do I put words above NPCs? I want to put words above NPCs like most servers do, so if I have
a pure shop, I want the shop NPC to say Pure Shop Here above his/her head. How do I do this?

5.	How do I edit where the whildy and safe areas are? 

6.	In my server, when I set NPCs to drop stuff, they do. BUT they never drop the item that I specify
in my npcdrops.cfg file. They always drop Item ID 0 - Dwarf Remains. How do I fix this so they drop
the item I want them to drop?</description>

<p>That’s an example for your first question. the 8000000 is the prices. Either copy that and change everything to what you want or copy the last item and do it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Search for this in your client.java and you’ll see some id’s, copy one and change it however you like.</p>

<li>Um, just look for things like this in your client.java</li>

<p>Do ctrl + f and put command in it. Or whatever look for custom command etc</p>

<li>Go to npchandler.java</li>

<p>Fine something similar to this</p>
