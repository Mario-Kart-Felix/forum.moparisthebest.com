    <description>(if this is in the wrong section sorry and move it please)

Ok yeah I&#39;d like some people to start a server with me. First of all you know i&#39;m serious if I don&#39;t speak such as &quot;OMG DUD3 ST41RT SW3VER M3 PL0X&quot;. And the people that start it with me I expect the same. I am serious as shit about this server and I expect my applicants to be the same.

What I&#39;m really looking for is one coder to help me code. And a couple admins and mods to look over the server. In fact, the coder is practically the second owner.


What I&#39;ll be doing:
I can host 24/7,No Hamachi,Its run on a damn good computer.
Coding-With my other guy.
Making our website.
And making different things just for us.
Add my MSN zachyboy1@hotmail.com for more information or if your interested and or if you don&#39;t feel for an application.

Also I&#39;m looking for a few mods and admins.

Admins needed:
0/2

Mods needed:
0/3

Coders needed:
0/1

If you wish to become a coder,mod,admin or any other position fill out this application please.

Name:

Why?:

Additional Info:

              <p>No claiming projects to be serious as in the rule. Yours is clearly not serious, you may have your mind to it, but that doesn’t make it serious. You need to actually be wiling to spend lots of time, and maybe lots of money to make it less lagier.</p>
