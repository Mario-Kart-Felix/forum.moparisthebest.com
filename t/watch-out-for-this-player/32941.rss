    <description>Recently I had a player disrupt my entire server. He normaly logs on as a name like this:

+your name+ ur gay
or
+your name+ dik

Or anything like that. Because what he did on my server was so serious I&#39;m going to post his ip. If this is not allowed, will a Mod or Admin change the post please, I do not want another ban.
