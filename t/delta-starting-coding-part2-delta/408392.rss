    <description>Hi, its me again just going to add another section on this because I hope to explain a little more things for people just starting.
in the first part of my tutorial i go over the basic starting out of coding a command example [code] if(command.startsWith(&quot;test&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 1);
triggerTele(XXXX, YYYY, 0);
}
else
{
sM(&quot;SERVER DETECTS YOU AREN&#39;T STAFF&quot;);
}
}[/code]
this isn&#39;t the exact code my last tutorial performed but its just an example i have typed up just to get a ruff idea of what i covered in my last tutorial.
in this part of the tutorial were going to go into different sections of the source i would go into different types of coding commands but i&#39;m sure there are tutorials/snippets that will go over them or you can request one in the comment bellow and i will &quot;spoon feed you it&quot; as people say.
but for now were going to look at the config folder just in case some people are unaware of what this config folder is for it is used for a various series of things such as adding npc&#39;s, making doors work , shops , ipbans bans and other various things that are titled in your config folder but the main idea of this tutorial is to help better your understanding of it.

config files should be open with word document which is a default program on your computer.

lets start with autospawn.cfg an example of a code line that will be in your autospawn.cfg folder will be something like ..
[code]spawn = 2263	3017	4824	0	3021	4828	2975	4820	1[/code]
explaining this is pretty simple the beginning of the code [code] spawn = [/code] basically lets the system know its about to spawn an npc.
[code]2263[/code]
2263 being the NPC ID.
the piece is where your going to spawn the npc ..      [code] 3017	4824[/code]     
this basically is the X and Y co-ords where you&#39;r going to spawn the npc the 3017 part being the X co-ord and the 4824 part being the Y co-ord.
The most important piece of this is being the gaps between all the numbers your gaps between your spawn and your first 4 numbers.[code]spawn = 2263[/code] should be separated by a space.
all the rest of the code.[code]	3017	4824	0	3021	4828	2975	4820	1[/code] should be separated by the key *TAB*.
the next part of this code explanation will be explaining the number [code] 0 [/code] after the Y co-ord this basically is referring to the height the npc should be spawned at.
the next set of numbers. [code] 3021 4828 [/code] piece of coding these are X+Y co-ords that would be added if you wished to make your npc walk around as is the other 8 digits [code] 2975 4820[/code] the first 8 digits should be higher than the second 8 so. [code] 3021 4828 [/code] is higher than the other 8. [code] 2975 4820[/code] 
IF you do not wish your npc to move simply change them to [code] 0 [/code]
and finally the last segment of the code the ending number [code] 1 [/code] this piece of the coding is basically telling the system what direction to point the npc.
I have just realized that in most .cfg files there is a description of the codes above that this one is the only one not listed so i will post but if there is no point in this tutorial i will remove.
the config folder does not require a compile to put the changes into action it simple needs a server restart due to the fact explained in my last tutorial.
that only .java files that are edited need to be compiled
i will stop here because i actually see no point in explaining things that are already explained in the files them self sorry if this tutorial was a waste of your time.</description>
