    <title>The time has come</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-time-has-come/449596</link>
    <description>As some of you have noticed, in the combat beta, RuneScape has... evolved.
And what I&#39;m trying to get to is this:
1. Players now actually stand up-right, and don&#39;t look like slumped-gangsters.
2. WE HAVE HANDS. OMFG.
3. Lastly, females have seemed to... developed &#39;breasts&#39; in-game.

So let&#39;s discuss; what do you think is next? Possible hair growth so you&#39;d have to go get a hair cut in-game to maintain your hair style?
Shit, I don&#39;t know. Explode my mind with what you guys think lol.</description>
