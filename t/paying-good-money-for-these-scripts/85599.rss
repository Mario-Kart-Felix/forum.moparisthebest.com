    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/paying-good-money-for-these-scripts/85599</link>
    <description>I need these scripts:

1.) I need a rock crab script. It will kill rocks crabs with attack, strength and range. It will have FULL anti-randoms, eat when at low hp and have great anti-ban. It will also log out and log back in every 20 min. I will pay up to 4mil for this.

2.) I also need an experiements script. It will kill experiments with attack and strength. It will have FULL anti-randoms, eat when at low hp and have great anti-ban. It will also log out and log back in every 20 min. I will pay up to 2mil for this.

3.) I need a range script that will kill orges at the training grounds. It will have an option to pick up arrows. It will have FULL anti-randoms, and have great anti-ban. It will also eat when low on hp. It will og out and log back in every 15 min. I am willing to pay up to 3.5mil for this.

4.) The last script i need (I need it the most) is a high-alching script that banks. t will have FULL anti-randoms and have great anti-ban. It will also log out and log back in every 10 min. It will back every 1000 alchs. I am willing to pay up to 2mil for this one. (I need to alch 120k Yew longbows)</description>

              <p>The only ones there i could do is the experiment script and alcing script, but remember, no script can be flawless and you will always risk the chance of being banned.  Autoing is usually done for money and noobs.  Best thing to do for these types of private scripts would be for you to leanr and make them yourself.</p>
