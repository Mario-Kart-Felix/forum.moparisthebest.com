    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/karils-bow-prob/286858</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, my karils bow seems to have a slight problem. I&#39;m using the PwnScapee source and Client.
I equip everything including the racks. It seems to work fine but when I fire it it doesn&#39;t hit/ So my guy would be standing there firing it but it wouldn&#39;t hit.
Anybody know how to fix this?
