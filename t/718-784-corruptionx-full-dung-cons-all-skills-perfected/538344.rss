CorruptionX was founded over 3 years ago, and started out as a small server. Through the dedication that was shown from the players, CorruptionX became one of the largest and most popular RSPS&#39;s to date. Recently, CorruptionX has merged with the developers of Matrix I and Matrix II in hope of creating a better atmosphere and experience for players. A spawn server was set up, then pre-eco PTR(Public Testing Realm) was released, and finally, amidst great anticipation,  CXMX Eco was rolled out for the public to play on.

Today, CorruptionX is populated with adventurers who wish to risk their lives fighting off Dragons, defeating Monsters from the 3rd Age, buying and selling goods to make a living, and even peaceful pheasants chopping wood and farming land. CXMX is a very densely populated server with lots of players online at any given time, and the community is friendly and welcoming!

CXMX offers a lot of features that you will never find on another server, coded to perfection, and these include:

Full Dungeoneering(only rsps with it)
