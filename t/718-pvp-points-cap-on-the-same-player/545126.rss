    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-pvp-points-cap-on-the-same-player/545126</link>
    <description>
Ok, so what i want to know is how/where to change it so that if you kill someone, you get a pk point, and you can kill the same person 3 times with getting points and then after that it says you cannot gain points from that same person for another 15 minutes.

So basically i want like, 

Player 1, Player 2.

Player 1 kills player 2
re-match
player 1 kills player 2, now has 2 pk points,

player 1 kills player 2 again, now has 3 pk points.

Player 1 kill player 2 but this time doesnt get another pk point.

The reason i want this is so that people cannot boost pk points.

Thanks in advance!</description>

<p>Thanks a bunch for this… I will try to rip the hell outta it and see if I can get it working… just one question, for the player.killstreaktimer, wouldn’t I have to add in like an integer or something? Im kinda new to coding 718’s, let alone rsps’s <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
