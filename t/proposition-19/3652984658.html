<p>People smoke cigarettes and drive all the time, nicotine is a serious drug far, far more dangerous that cannabis. As are caffeine and alcohol.</p>
<p>That said, I wouldn’t expect people to work high, in the same way I don’t expect people to work drunk.</p>
<p>In all honesty, as I’m sure most of you are aware - I’m not a fan of modern America (how it’s deviated from what it was supposed to be) but the same goes for Britain. I will undoubtedly try to move to California in the next decade if we don’t see similar change over here (that’s presuming the proposition passes).[/quote]<br>
Im pretty sure the legalization will be closely analyzed in California, and then when all seems good it will go national, and if that goes well other countries may fallow.</p>

<p>Police in Australia have the equipment necessary to test for alcohol, cannabis, ecstasy, and methamphetamine. I don’t think the information flyer I read said LSD, but I don’t see why they wouldn’t test for other hallucinogens.<br>
I bet you could get away with the rarer ones though like mescaline, assuming the same test couldn’t be applied to just any drug.</p>
<p>With that said, police here only breathalyse or drug test you if you’re either behind the wheel or acting like an absolute idiot in public (ie, America’s ‘disturbing the peace’ law), and I think you’d have to be pretty crazy to knowingly drive under the influence of a hallucinogen.</p>

<p>How is this relevant? Hey if you drank too much water and got water intoxication then went to drive, you would be at risk of getting into an accident as well.</p>
<p>As you brought up cigarettes beforehand. I think you’re just saying anything right now to de-sensitize the risk of driving whilst high. I think you should think a little bit harder and come up with some better examples. Nicotine and Paracetamol is just not going to cut it as a comparison.</p>

This is where i stand. I think if it becomes legal it may influence more and less will get done.[/quote]<br>
I’m not concerned with productivity so much as I am with safety. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/greeny-2.html">@Greeny</a>: Of course it seems easy, that’s one of the risks – people overestimate their ability while under the influence of substance X.<br>
With alcohol they’re less conservative; odds are they’ll attempt riskier maneuvers, or attempt usually safe maneuvers in a manner that is unsafe.<br>
As far as weed goes, a show I watched suggested that someone under the influence was actually more conservative behind the wheel. This makes it very clear that perception is affected at least a bit, if not a great deal.</p>
<p>Reflexes required to avoid a crash aren’t there when under the influence of either substance.</p>
<p>Besides, there’s no evidence to suggest that making weed legal will increase the number of people who want to smoke it.<br>
It’s the same with cigarettes – being available doesn’t make them desirable in the eyes of those who simply don’t wish to smoke them.<br>
In short, more people will smoke. But those who hadn’t previously smoked probably wanted to but didn’t because of the law. They already had a predisposition to recreational drug usage but simply avoided it because it was illegal.</p>

<p>It’s like if you swallowed too many paracetomol and tried to drive</p>

<p>How is this relevant? Hey if you drank too much water and got water intoxication then went to drive, you would be at risk of getting into an accident as well.</p>
<p>As you brought up cigarettes beforehand. I think you’re just saying anything right now to de-sensitize the risk of driving whilst high. I think you should think a little bit harder and come up with some better examples. Nicotine and Paracetamol is just not going to cut it as a comparison.[/quote]</p>
<p>Haha, you’re pathetic. You believe anything you’re spoon fed by the government. I do my research before I say something controversial, you think I’m using weak examples and plucking things out of thing air…? I say nicotine because it’s a disgusting drug, and personally when I’ve smoked a cigarette (the rare occasion) the nicotine rush (as it’s known round here) is overwhelming for me - I even know people who use it to get to sleep (that don’t like weed). Then there’s just the fact tobacco and nicotine are genuinely bad for you. Toxic in fact, while cannabis isn’t.</p>
<p>What you said about water was exactly my point, or did you fail to notice that while getting all smart-arse. If you ingest anything in large quantities it makes you ill, I said paracetamol because I know for a fact an overdose could kill you (never mind the affect on your driving). Cannabis does not kill you, you’d have to blaze up more than your own bodyweight in a matter of minutes to OD.</p>
<p>You think it impairs driving? I suppose you read all the government propaganda about drug driving. They have a few dodgy medical journal publishings too about it’s effects. Funny how the ones that actually have valid science and fair testing say that the impairment is not measurable. In fact, hysteria or paranoia could potentially impair it, but these are psychological pseudo symptoms that you will only feel if you put them in your own head.</p>
<p>But hey, I’m just trying to de-sensitise it because Cannabis is a dangerous drug and Tobacco and Paracetamol are both safe because they can be bought over the counter. You total fucking moron.</p>

Cigarettes don’t change your perception of time like weed and alcohol do, which in my opinion is the reason those two are dangerous in the workplace or while doing anything that requires a level of skill.<br>

This is where i stand. I think if it becomes legal it may influence more and less will get done.[/quote]</p>
<p>Weed is not a gateway drug, ask anyone you know who smokes weed what they started with?.. Alcohol. Addictive, dangerous and most importantly legal.</p>
<p>Don’t assume because it’s legal it’s safe. Tobacco and alcohol are way more deadly, and you don’t even need to be sat in a car to be vulnerable.</p>

I’m personally all for this getting passed, but not in the way they are doing it. They act as if it still changes your mood, and ability to do things far more critically then it truly does. Something tells me theres far more ways that the law is going to get involved with this.<br>

<p>It does affect people.  I wouldn’t want people smoking weed and driving, or to be working in a factory where people high on weed were operating heavy machinery.  If you don’t believe this would pose a danger than you are fooling yourself.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well obviously if you’re to smoke it in large amounts. But I see no danger in smoking say a bowl or two of cannabis and driving somewhere or doing something that requires some skill. Maybe to a new smoker I can see a problem. But someone who smokes often should have enough of a tolerance built up that they could control it no different than if they were 100% sober.</p>

        <p>If I had employees, I wouldn’t want them coming into work drunk or high, or smoking cigarettes either, for that matter.  When on the road I don’t want any other drivers doing anything that increases their chances of losing control of their vehicle, this includes being drunk or high, texting on their phone or playing with the radio.  What you do on your own time in the privacy of your own home is your own business.</p>
<p>The point I’m making is that someone who smoked any amount of weed is more impaired than someone who hasn’t smoked any weed when it comes to driving, and laws should be similar to driving under the influence of alcohol laws.</p>

<p>Exactly, the same thing applies with alcohol.  Some people pass out at .08 BAC, others can tolerate twice that much rather well, but it’s still not legal to have that amount in your blood and drive.</p>

        <p>Greeny: You’re basically saying that cannabis is safe, as long as you don’t overdo it, right? Doesn’t the same apply to alcohol. It’s common sense actually. I can drink a beer or two and feel absolutely fine, but if I drink more I know I’ll be a hazard on the road.</p>
<p>I’m for drug use, but I’ve never done drugs myself, so I can’t talk from my own experience. But I’ve seen people that were high, and their responsiveness was quite bad. I don’t know how high they were, but they certainly wouldn’t be a safe driver. And they were only doing soft drugs, imagine what a danger someone doing speed would be.</p>
<p>And about being high while at work: It differs. If you’re working with heavy machinery while being as high as a kite, you’d be a hazard. If you are working in an office while being high, you wouldn’t be a hazard, but I wouldn’t do business with people that are high while I’m trying to do business with them.</p>

        <p>Canabis should have the same restraints placed on i as alcohol does. Do it at home or in a designated consumption area and don’t work, drive or operate machinery. Also there are so many variations of weed that it’s impossible to say “If you smoke this strain you can drive whereas if you smoke this stronger variety then you can’t”</p>
<p>When I went to Amsterdam the first night I smoked some really mellow shit, whereas the second night we picked up some white widow and I passed out after about 10 minutes. The fact that they are both under the term weed makes it very hard to create legislation. Legalise it but put realistic laws on it, maybe even tax it.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Speljohan, post:34, topic:365298”]Greeny is everything i hate about drug-liberals, sorry.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t ever in my life dare to sit behind the wheels high or drunk, it’s not just your own life on the line, it’s others.[/quote]</p>
<p>So the governments of the world all came up with their own limits on alcohol and what that they think is safe to drive, body mass, height, weight these things apparently make no difference where I live - how about you?</p>
<p>I say that a drug far less intoxicating than alcohol, can be used in reasonable amounts without driving impairment and the liar here is me? I’m not even a “drug” liberal. I don’t even drink. I use weed and that’s it. Look at all the drunk driving incidents at your home, drunken domestic beatings, drunken suicides then find me the same statistics for weed. I don’t even need to tell you this, I know you know it. Tobacco the other drug we’re partly discussing here kills millions because it’s toxic.</p>
<p>I’m actually ashamed you think I’d drive like that, I know my limits, personally I wait till the high has come down. There’s enough research to suggest people drive safer, as safe or without major impairment. It’s been done and you choose to ignore it because you believe it’s irresponsible. Driving two and a half years, never made a mistake on my test, never had a mishap on the road. I bet if I drank and drove (even up to the limit) this wouldn’t be the case.</p>
<p>As for keeping the roads safe, sure it’s important but you can’t fix a flawed system. You can go to a doctors get prescribed a whole array of pharmaceutical concoctions that will effect your driving just tremendously and then legally drive on all of them just because the box says “WARNING: DRIVING MAY BE IMPAIRED”. Those big companies that make these drugs don’t even put this on themselves, the pharmacist has too. Why? Because they have rich corporate bank accounts, so they just don’t care, if you’re in a crash you’re going to hospital and just ingesting more of their handy work. You should all be well aware (if you read the news) antidepressants are taken by millions all over the world, these affect driving skills- a lot. Fatigue also kills more drivers than weed does.</p>
<p>Sorry, I just don’t like being labelled then hated on for something that isn’t me. Calling me a<br>
drug liberal just because I know how to stand up for a debate and issue my argument effectively doesn’t make me some lying left wing political substance bank. I use a single substance when most people use 2-3, and I don’t support any narcotic unless it can grow out the ground and has done for at least a few thousand years.</p>

<p>I lol’d at this part.<br>
I pretty much started with white widow and didn’t pass out at all, so that makes me wonder how you passed out because of it…</p>

<p>For a seasoned toker, it’s probably not going to make a difference in your reactions. But there’s no way to regulate that, it’s best it remains illegal to drive stoned.</p>
