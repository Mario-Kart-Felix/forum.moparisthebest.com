<p>FWIW though, I think being stoned definitely impairs my driving (well, riding) ability. Even more so than a few drinks, I’d say. (Though, less than being properly drunk, obviously.) I don’t do it anymore, because I grew up and realised it was fucking irresponsible to drive under the influence of <em>anything</em> (self righteous posse represent :D) but I used to have a spliff or two the morning after a heavy night to clear the head, and riding home was ridiculously stupid sometimes - every white car is a cop, every kid on the pavement is gonna jump out and you’re gonna kill him, every car coming out of a sideroad is going to not see you and pull out in front of you.</p>
<p>Then again, I get majorly paranoid from weed anyway.[/quote]I used to get paranoid, back when I first started smoking it. When I’m out nowadays I really don’t care who thinks I’m stoned or not anymore, I just enjoy the buzz (:</p>

        <p>I’m completely lost in this debate between Greeny and mapu. Greeny says that driving high is doable, as long as you’re not too stoned, and mapu says that it affects your reactions. Or am I missing something?</p>
<p>The keyword in Greeny’s opinion is ‘too’. This implies that there is a boundary, after which the effects of drugs do affect your driving abilities, but as long as you don’t cross a certain threshold you are safe. mapu believes this threshold lies between not being high at all, and having inhaled a pinch of smoke. Greeny believes that the threshold differs for each person.</p>
<p>Obviously, Greeny is right. Everyone should know their limits, and act accordingly. Speljohan is right when he says that when you’re driving a car it’s not just your own life, but also that of others. So everyone that feels that he is too high to be able to judge traffic situations, shouldn’t drive because he knows he passed his limit and shouldn’t endanger himself and others.</p>
<p>There’s one question left: Do people actually know their limits, and do they act accordingly? There are a lot of substances that affect your driving abilities, like alcohol, drugs (medicines), perhaps nicotine (are there any studies about this?), and the drugs discussed here. I know that alcohol makes you believe that you can do more then you actually can, so even one bottle of beer can make you a bad driver without even knowing it. Prescription drugs have a lot of negative effects, some make you drowsy, some make you nervous etc.</p>
<p>So how can you prevent substance related accidents from happening? By setting one standard: Don’t use and drive. Because it’s too much of a hassle to judge everyone individually, limits are set that apply to everyone. At the moment, alcohol is barely allowed, but prescription drugs are hardly regulated.</p>
<p>It’s a shame that a lot have to suffer because a few are irresponsible, but if it prevents accidents in exchange for me not being allowed to drive for a few hours I know what to pick.</p>

<p>Pretty much agree with this.</p>
<p>I don’t even see why its suffering, because nobody has to drive high or drunk. How hard is planning ahead and getting a train, or getting a cab?</p>

        <p>[quote=“R.I.P RSC, post:67, topic:365298”]I’m completely lost in this debate between Greeny and mapu. Greeny says that driving high is doable, as long as you’re not too stoned, and mapu says that it affects your reactions. Or am I missing something?</p>
<p>The keyword in Greeny’s opinion is ‘too’. This implies that there is a boundary, after which the effects of drugs do affect your driving abilities, but as long as you don’t cross a certain threshold you are safe. mapu believes this threshold lies between not being high at all, and having inhaled a pinch of smoke. Greeny believes that the threshold differs for each person.</p>
<p>Obviously, Greeny is right. Everyone should know their limits, and act accordingly. Speljohan is right when he says that when you’re driving a car it’s not just your own life, but also that of others. So everyone that feels that he is too high to be able to judge traffic situations, shouldn’t drive because he knows he passed his limit and shouldn’t endanger himself and others.</p>
<p>There’s one question left: Do people actually know their limits, and do they act accordingly? There are a lot of substances that affect your driving abilities, like alcohol, drugs (medicines), perhaps nicotine (are there any studies about this?), and the drugs discussed here. I know that alcohol makes you believe that you can do more then you actually can, so even one bottle of beer can make you a bad driver without even knowing it. Prescription drugs have a lot of negative effects, some make you drowsy, some make you nervous etc.</p>
<p>So how can you prevent substance related accidents from happening? By setting one standard: Don’t use and drive. Because it’s too much of a hassle to judge everyone individually, limits are set that apply to everyone. At the moment, alcohol is barely allowed, but prescription drugs are hardly regulated.</p>

<p>Good post, and I agree with a lot of it. Unfortunately most drug tests know if you’ve used, but not when or how long ago. This is clearly the major issue at hand, if weed were legalised then the government’s would be forced to develop an “alcohol-like” test for weed. Currently a breathalyser  doesn’t know when you drank, but it does measure a concentration that they claim tells them if we’re over the limit (a limit they decide). Ideally we need something like this for cannabis, unfortunately I see it appearing after legalisation and not before - as while it’s still illegal a test for weed only needs to say positive or negative.</p>
<p>So are people generally in favour or against Prop19 currently?</p>
<p>Andrew, I’d like to hear more from you, as your post in it’s current state is totally useless and non-informative to anyone.</p>

<p>I believe there’s a fine limit for me. It improves my driving if I’m a high but not stoned, but whilst stoned I can drive totally fine - as if on autopilot except for when something out of the ordinary happens and I have to act on impulse rather than learned driving behaviours. This is when things can go wrong. I’ve learned now not to drive like that, despite the fact I know damn well I could and probably have no problems. I just don’t feel irresponsible enough to risk it.</p>
<p>I have no science to back this up unfortunately. Just personal experience.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, weed can stay in your system for far longer than 30 days in hair and sometimes fat cells (if you’ve smoked for years) I know jme already probably knows this, I’m just adding it for anyone whose reading the above post and learning that info for the first time.</p>

<p>They can be quite dangerous. A few months ago, a 92 year old man was spectator during the ‘Eleven-city tour for bicycles’ (combine Frisian and Dutch culture and you get a 240km bicycle tour you have to complete in a single day). When he left, in his car, he had to go a little distance in reverse. There still was a crowd about 10-20 meters behind him. He probably did his best trying to leave his parking space. But instead of breaking, he put the petal to the metal and injured 4 people. He had to give up his driving licence.</p>
<p>Currently, everyone between 60 and 65 can get a new licence without a medical checkup, and that license is valid until he or she turns 70. After that, you have to get a medical checkup before you get a new license. Thing is, the license you get after you turn 65 is valid for 5 years. I don’t know if you have any experience with it, but old people can deteriorate heavily in 5 years. Usually, relatives will try to prevent old people from driving, but old people can be stubborn too, and have to feel the consequences before they understand that they are a hazard. Too bad people get hurt that way.</p>

<p>Currently a breathalyser  doesn’t know when you drank, but it does measure a concentration that they claim tells them if we’re over the limit (a limit they decide). Ideally we need something like this for cannabis, unfortunately I see it appearing after legalisation and not before - as while it’s still illegal a test for weed only needs to say positive or negative.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The Dutch police uses a breathalyser too, but I believe only to determine whether you are above a certain limit. If you are, you are escorted to a police station and then you have your blood analyzed. The blood analysis is used to determine whether you were actually above the limit, because breathalysers can be prone to false positives.</p>
<p>I have no idea how the Dutch police tests drug use. I’ll look in to that. But I’m sure that they don’t check your fat cells or your hair, because they have to know that you used drugs in such a time frame that it <span class="bbcode-b">could</span> affect your driving abilities, not that you used it in the last month(s).</p>

<p>Prescription drugs are strictly regulated here. Altho, Sweden is the strictest country in the world when it comes to substances and traffic.</p>

</aside>
<p>We have one law that states that:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 Dutch law:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>It is expressly forbidden to drive or for a driver to drive while he is in under the influence of a substance, which he knows or reasonably should know, that its use - whether or not combined with the use of another substance - may reduce ability to drive, or that he must be considered unable to properly drive</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>(Translated with Google Translate, so it may sound a bit odd)</p>
<p>The Dutch government even has a website about driving will using prescription drugs. But it all boils down to you being a responsible driver, as there is no way to prove whether you were under the influence of prescription drugs. There is no limit, like there is for alcohol. So it’s illegal, but you can do what you want because they can’t make a case against you.</p>
<p>A while ago there was a documentary about prescription drugs, especially about anti-depressants (altough heavily off-topic, it was on the public tv station. The Dutch public broadcaster actually criticizes the government when they can, commercial stations don’t). What followed was a parliamentary discussion. I have no idea what happened since, but the law hasn’t changed.</p>

<p>I believe that in this case the anti-depressants were heavily tied to aggression. A survey done by a tv show (I’d prefer a better source, but we have to do with this one for now) got 11.000 reactions. 22% thought about suicide (but hey, you’re depressed, you almost think of suicide by definition :P). But 14% said that they felt like going on a havoc in traffic. When around 8% of the Dutch people above 20 years take anti-depressants, and this number is steadily growing, it’s something to worry about.</p>
<p>Luckily, these people actually admitted that they were aggressive, and probably acted upon it.</p>
<p>Of course, the link between anti-depressants and aggression is still scientifically unproven. These numbers only show correlation, not cause. But it justifies research and caution.</p>

        <p>A lot of anti-depressants come with a label that warns you not to drive or to be “cautious while driving”. However, no policeman if he found you with them in your bag at the wheel would ever think to have you tested or anything like that.</p>
<p>Over here we have a serious depression issue too, I can’t remember the exact figures but our doctors have prescribed them to some ridiculous statistic and it’s getting pretty extreme.</p>
