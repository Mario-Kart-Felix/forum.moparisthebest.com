<p>And there it is, some people can drink 10 beers and drive safely, some people can get really high and drive safely.  It doesn’t mean it’s a good idea, and it certainly shouldn’t be legal for everyone to do, because we know everyone couldn’t do that safely.</p>

<p>Driving high is honestly easy, you’ve just got to not be too stoned, the problem is people dont its safe because it’s currently illegal. It’s like if you swallowed too many paracetomol and tried to drive</p>

</aside>
<p>Driving high slows down your reaction times. It also alters your perception. Does this really need to be explained to you? Driving high is “easy”, but it’s also as dangerous as drunk driving.</p>

</aside>
<p>How is this relevant? Hey if you drank too much water and got water intoxication then went to drive, you would be at risk of getting into an accident as well.</p>
<p>As you brought up cigarettes beforehand. I think you’re just saying anything right now to de-sensitize the risk of driving whilst high. I think you should think a little bit harder and come up with some better examples. Nicotine and Paracetamol is just not going to cut it as a comparison.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Haha, you’re pathetic. You believe anything you’re spoon fed by the government. I do my research before I say something controversial, you think I’m using weak examples and plucking things out of thing air…? I say nicotine because it’s a disgusting drug, and personally when I’ve smoked a cigarette (the rare occasion) the nicotine rush (as it’s known round here) is overwhelming for me - I even know people who use it to get to sleep (that don’t like weed). Then there’s just the fact tobacco and nicotine are genuinely bad for you. Toxic in fact, while cannabis isn’t.[/quote]<br>
What are you talking about, the Government? In Australia our politicians talk about the economy, they rarely mention drugs at all. Unlike the Americans, our poli’s don’t waste their time focusing on something as petty as weed.</p>
<blockquote>You think it impairs driving? I suppose you read all the government propaganda about drug driving. They have a few dodgy medical journal publishings too about it's effects. Funny how the ones that actually have valid science and fair testing say that the impairment is not measurable. In fact, hysteria or paranoia could potentially impair it, but these are psychological pseudo symptoms that you will only feel if you put them in your own head.</blockquote>
I was actually writing from my own experience greeny, unlike your STRONG views about government brainwashing (think you been smoking a bit too much, bro). I smoke a small amount of weed everyday after work to chill out. When I comment about weed I do it from my own experience, I don't need to bring politics into the argument. I know for a fact it's dangerous for people to drive whilst stoned, because I have been stoned a rediculous amount of times and an idiot would realize that it's unsafe to drive whilst on it.
<blockquote>But hey, I'm just trying to de-sensitise it because Cannabis is a dangerous drug and Tobacco and Paracetamol are both safe because they can be bought over the counter. You total fucking moron.</blockquote>
I'm pretty sure you're the only one debating the effects of paracetamol here. Why don't you make a seperate topic for that? You're in fact trying to de-sensitize the reality that weed does impair you and it's unsafe to drive whilst on it. Hey, don't worry the government is making me say this so there's your justification to talk to me like a condescending fool. I thought the moderators were suppose to be a little more mature.
<blockquote>RE: NICOTINE/ I even know people who use it to get to sleep (that don't like weed).</blockquote>
<p>Smoking will keep you up and awake, The army get their people on night guard to smoke just to help them stay awake and alert.</p>

        <p>The thing with differing effects is that legislators don’t truly understand all of the ins and outs based on height/weight/tolerance/etc, and neither do citizens.<br>
Try telling someone that they should only drink x mL of alcohol over y hours to remain under the limit (ie, more precise than standard drinks), and you’ll confuse them most of the time.<br>
Likewise, give them a formula to follow (ie, acceptable drink count = (x / y + a - b) * c) and it just doesn’t work.</p>

<p>jme talks total sense, fortunately you reminded me to pick up on something I forgot. The way blood/urine/hair drug testing works now, it detects THC in your system that has been there for a long period of time, even in the blood it’ll remain there for days to weeks (depending on how much you smoke). In Australia I think they’ve started developing the THC breathalysers but the problem is these are still supposed to detect anything that’s been smoked in the past 24-48 hours and anyone who smokes weed knows the effects taper after just one or two.</p>
<p>Meaning, if it stays the way it is, illegal to drive on cannabis and these breathalysers get rolled out worldwide (I know they’re coming to the UK 2011/2012) you could be driving to work 12 hours after the previous night’s joint and get pulled for drug driving. That’s what this law does, unless it’s refined.</p>

Driving high is honestly easy, you’ve just got to not be too stoned, the problem is people dont its safe because it’s currently illegal. It’s like if you swallowed too many paracetomol and tried to drive<br>

<p>Driving high slows down your reaction times. It also alters your perception. Does this really need to be explained to you? Driving high is “easy”, but it’s also as dangerous as drunk driving.</p>

You think it impairs driving? I suppose you read all the government propaganda about drug driving. They have a few dodgy medical journal publishings too about it’s effects. Funny how the ones that actually have valid science and fair testing say that the impairment is not measurable. In fact, hysteria or paranoia could potentially impair it, but these are psychological pseudo symptoms that you will only feel if you put them in your own head.</p>

<p>I was actually writing from my own experience greeny, unlike your STRONG views about government brainwashing (think you been smoking a bit too much, bro). I smoke a small amount of weed everyday after work to chill out. When I comment about weed I do it from my own experience, I don’t need to bring politics into the argument. I know for a fact it’s dangerous for people to drive whilst stoned, because I have been stoned a rediculous amount of times and an idiot would realize that it’s unsafe to drive whilst on it.[/quote]</p>
<p>Haha, so awesome I have plenty of experience of my own you know. Except I can read, so I choose to read publications of research in a whole variety of medical journals. You see… this is a controversial subject, hence why it’s in the discussion and debates section and this is the case all over the world. If the answer were simple, it would not need to be debated to get their. Hence why I love debates, and fully take part and enjoy myself bringing as much to the table in the means of knowledge and research as I can.</p>
<p>It’s totally awesome when you ignore it, kind of like the government ignores the reasons why cannabis was banned in the first place, but I’m not going into that because apparently it’s a conspiracy theory (it’s not, go read about it - it all happened in the past 200 years and it’s pretty well documented on). I do have to make a point though, I do find it genuinely pathetic you accuse me of being some conspiracy nut who smokes to much weed as if I match a typical weed smoking stereotype. That’s degrading, for you - not for me. Show’s just how little you actually know.</p>
<p>[quote=“mapu”][quote author=Greeny]<br>

I’m pretty sure you’re the only one debating the effects of paracetamol here. Why don’t you make a seperate topic for that? You’re in fact trying to de-sensitize the reality that weed does impair you and it’s unsafe to drive whilst on it.

Nicotine is a stimulant, and so gives you a nicotine rush congratulations we know this. However under fatigue, say at the end of the long day, I’m told a quick fag gives you a slight lift then you crash like a pile of bricks. A few friends personal choices. If anything it just further proves how drugs affect people differently and laws cannot be based on just what the mass population believes will happen.

</aside>
<p>Not really, at all.  I’ve been pulled over a few times in my life, and I’ve never been given a breathalyser.  They don’t administer those tests unless you are acting impaired, and, even then, they only give a breathalyser after you fail certain sobriety checks (walk the line, touch your finger to tip of your nose, etc etc).  Also, if weed was legal, a test that told if you smoked it in the last 24-48 hours would be useless wouldn’t it?  They would have to develop a test that accurately tests whether you are high at the moment.</p>

Meaning, if it stays the way it is, illegal to drive on cannabis and these breathalysers get rolled out worldwide (I know they’re coming to the UK 2011/2012) you could be driving to work 12 hours after the previous night’s joint and get pulled for drug driving. That’s what this law does, unless it’s refined.<br>

<p>Not really, at all.  I’ve been pulled over a few times in my life, and I’ve never been given a breathalyser.  They don’t administer those tests unless you are acting impaired, and, even then, they only give a breathalyser after you fail certain sobriety checks (walk the line, touch your finger to tip of your nose, etc etc).  Also, if weed was legal, a test that told if you smoked it in the last 24-48 hours would be useless wouldn’t it?  They would have to develop a test that accurately tests whether you are high at the moment.[/quote]<br>
For the record, police in Australia automatically breathalyse. And they set up check points on popular roads and breathalyse as many people as they can, regardless of the likelihood that said person has been drinking.</p>
<p>I think they’re less heavy handed with the drug tests. Mind you, if you were driving and your eyes were blood shot or your pupils dilated, you’d be in the shit. Or you smelt of weed, of course.</p>

<p>You’re totally right, and that’s what I mean by it really, really has to be refined because it just wouldn’t work. I scored out some because this may be true for America, but as Lothy said - this wouldn’t likely happen in Aus or the UK.</p>
<hr>
<p>mapu, I debate hard with anyone who opens up the floor to it. I enjoy it, I may go overboard. If I call someone pathetic it’s usually because I feel like as though someone is missing the hard points and just arguing with me for the sake of it. And if you knew anything about me you’d know that’s a pretty common occasion. I don’t see anything but quality debate with a few minor hiccups. You should see the UK government shout bullshit at each other on the BBC. Now, that’s bad debating.</p>
<p>It’s not important, I don’t have to like you to debate with you. If I wanted to be personal I’d have mentioned the obscurity of your RSC shemale tutorial or the fact that I didn’t like your porn tutorial on cracking passwords. However, that’s off-topic and irrelevant. Kind of like the recurring paracetamol theme; which you seem pretty sure deserves it’s own thread. I was using it as a reference for a “harmless drug that is potentially quite dangerous”. If you think it needs discussing further please stop asking me, and just pick up the ball.</p>
<p>I’m not multi quoting this post because by now it’ll get to messy, however the importance of reading the news. You’re quite adamant still Australia isn’t bothered about weed, I don’t live there, it doesn’t affect or bother me. Research by the way usually involves medical journals, scientific data rather than just news, blogs and google. I like to be sure, and it takes a few minutes I don’t see how that’s a lack of sustaining something important in my life. I’m leaving this point behind it’s not even necessary. Australia is like the UK it actively evades talking about drug legalisation because the current government can’t handle the embarrassment of a “dangerous drug” actually turning out to be totally safe.</p>
<p>You’re smoking opinions differ from my friends, fair enough. I know what they do, everyday, you know what you do. You can’t dismiss something because it’s not in your behavioural routine. If they can’t sleep without a cigarette and you can, then good for you because you’ll probably live a bit longer.</p>
<p>I think we should try and pull this debate more in towards proposition 19 again, it’s OK to deter to vaguely related material but I feel like we’ve just leapfrogged drug driving and heading down the long terrible road to flame war. There’s only one winner of that, GEEMAWDZ.</p>

        <p>I don’t really understand why driving under the influence is even a point of a discussion - it’s not like people don’t do it now.</p>
<p>FWIW though, I think being stoned definitely impairs my driving (well, riding) ability. Even more so than a few drinks, I’d say. (Though, less than being properly drunk, obviously.) I don’t do it anymore, because I grew up and realised it was fucking irresponsible to drive under the influence of <em>anything</em> (self righteous posse represent :D) but I used to have a spliff or two the morning after a heavy night to clear the head, and riding home was ridiculously stupid sometimes - every white car is a cop, every kid on the pavement is gonna jump out and you’re gonna kill him, every car coming out of a sideroad is going to not see you and pull out in front of you.</p>
<p>Then again, I get majorly paranoid from weed anyway.</p>
