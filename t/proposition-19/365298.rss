    <title>Proposition 19</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/proposition-19/365298</link>
    <description>Well as some of you may know already on November 2, 2010 Californians will be voting on a law for the full legalization for recreational use of Marijuana. This could be a huge step in Marijuana law reform. 

What proposition 19 consists of. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;May possess up to 1 ounce (28 g) of marijuana for personal consumption.
May use marijuana in a non-public place such as a residence or a public establishment licensed for on site marijuana consumption.
May grow marijuana at a private residence in a space of up to 25 square feet (2.3 m2) for personal use.

Local government may authorize the retail sale of up to 1 ounce (28 g) of marijuana per transaction, and regulate the hours and location of the business.
Local government may authorize larger amounts of marijuana for personal possession and cultivation, or for commercial cultivation, transportation, and sale.
Allows for the transportation of marijuana from a licensed premises in one city or county to a licensed premises in another city or county, without regard to local laws of intermediate localities to the contrary.

Allows the collection of taxes to allow local governments to raise revenue or to offset any costs associated with marijuana regulation.

Maintains existing laws against selling drugs to a minor and driving under the influence.
Maintains an employer&#39;s right to address consumption of marijuana that affects an employee&#39;s job performance.
Maintain existing laws against interstate or international transportation of marijuana.
Every person 18 years of age or older who hires, employs, or uses a minor in transporting, carrying, selling, giving away marijuana, or knowingly sells or gives away marijuana to someone under the age of 14, shall be imprisoned in state prison for a period of three, five, or seven years.
Every person 18 years of age or older who knowingly sells or gives away marijuana to someone older than the age of 14 but younger than 18, shall be imprisoned in the state prison for a period of three, four, or five years.
Every person 21 years of age or older or over who knowingly sells or gives away marijuana to someone older than the age of 18 but younger than 21, shall be imprisoned in county jail for up to six months and fined up to $1,000 per offense.
Any person who is licensed, permitted, or authorized to sell marijuana, who knowingly sells or gives away marijuana to someone under the age of 21 results in them being banned from owning, operating, or being employed by a licensed marijuana establishment for one year.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What are your views on this, should it be passed? 


Believe it or not I think that this bill should not pass, I am fully for the legalization of recreational use of Marijuana, it will save the state Millions of dollars and free up thousands of jail cells from non-violent inmates caught with simple possession to minor dealing. I think they&#39;re a few things wrong with this proposal however that need to be worked out.</description>

<p>Probably.  Maybe they all got high thinking it was going to pass and then the next day went ‘shit, I was so stoned I forgot to go out and vote!!!’. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

You’d be surprised how many people just don’t vote. Either way, it is sad to see that people still have a problem with marijuana, but people have their reasons.</p>

<p>Nope not yet, someone edited Wiki and trolled it saying it won and put the votes and I almost believed it for a second lol. I don’t know when they’ll have the votes counted and everything hopefully soon, I don’t think it will pass actually. I’m on the fence about it.</p>

<blockquote>Are you age 18-20? You will not be allowed to consume cannabis legally under Prop 19. Currently, all you need is a medical recommendation to do so.
<p>• Do you interact with anyone under age of 21? You will be looking at up to 6 months in jail for passing them a joint. (If the person is under 18 you will be looking at up to 7 years in prison.)</p>
<p>• Do you live in the same “space” and a minor? (Space could mean anything from the same house to an entire apartment complex.) You will not be allowed to consume cannabis.</p>
<p>• Do you rent your home? Prop 19 will only allow you to grow cannabis if you have permission from your landlord. Due to the risks involved, many (if not most) California landlords do not allow it. How is this legalization?</p>
<p>• Do you grow cannabis with a doctor recommendation? Prop 19 will likely be interpreted by law enforcement and judges to limit your grow space to 5′x5′.</p>
<p>• Do you provide your extra medical cannabis to dispensaries? It will be a crime to do so if Prop 19 passes. In addition, large Oakland growers and tobacco companies will take control of the market and push you out.</p>
<p>• Do you currently have to use your medical cannabis anywhere but home? Prop 19 will prevent patients from using their medicine anywhere in pubic. Which for many people with illnesses is not always possible.</p>
<p>• Do you sell your extra medical cannabis to other medical patients? Prop 19 will make this practice illegal. Even if you are only selling it to cover your growing cost.</p>
<p>• Do you currently enjoy the use of cannabis free from Government interference? Not only will the Government impose excessive taxes under Prop 19, but the federal government will likely respond with unprecedented action against California cannabis users. “The federal Controlled Substances Act makes it a felony to grow or sell cannabis. California can repeal its own marijuana laws, leaving enforcement to the feds. But it can’t legalize a federal felony. Therefore, any grower or seller paying California taxes on marijuana sales or filing pot-related California regulatory paperwork would be confessing, in writing, to multiple federal crimes.”</p>

<p>I’d be wary of deciding they’re over-prescribed. I mean, I wouldn’t know either way, but I do know that recently they’ve found uses that weren’t originally on-label uses. For example, benzos are rarely prescribed to long-term anxiety patients anymore, the first line of treatment is SSRI’s like prozac or zoloft. If you come up with more conditions that warrant them, then the numbers will obviously go up.</p>

A while ago there was a documentary about prescription drugs, especially about anti-depressants (altough heavily off-topic, it was on the public tv station.

<p>I’m not sure how you would change it.

<p>I believe that in this case the anti-depressants were heavily tied to aggression. A survey done by a tv show (I’d prefer a better source, but we have to do with this one for now) got 11.000 reactions. 22% thought about suicide (but hey, you’re depressed, you almost think of suicide by definition :P). But 14% said that they felt like going on a havoc in traffic. When around 8% of the Dutch people above 20 years take anti-depressants, and this number is steadily growing, it’s something to worry about.</p>
<p>Luckily, these people actually admitted that they were aggressive, and probably acted upon it.</p>
<p>Of course, the link between anti-depressants and aggression is still scientifically unproven. These numbers only show correlation, not cause. But it justifies research and caution.</p>

<p>But while I’m on the subject of reaction times, let’s also ban senior citizens from driving.</p>

</aside>
<p>They can be quite dangerous. A few months ago, a 92 year old man was spectator during the ‘Eleven-city tour for bicycles’ (combine Frisian and Dutch culture and you get a 240km bicycle tour you have to complete in a single day). When he left, in his car, he had to go a little distance in reverse. There still was a crowd about 10-20 meters behind him. He probably did his best trying to leave his parking space. But instead of breaking, he put the petal to the metal and injured 4 people. He had to give up his driving licence.</p>
<p>Currently, everyone between 60 and 65 can get a new licence without a medical checkup, and that license is valid until he or she turns 70. After that, you have to get a medical checkup before you get a new license. Thing is, the license you get after you turn 65 is valid for 5 years. I don’t know if you have any experience with it, but old people can deteriorate heavily in 5 years. Usually, relatives will try to prevent old people from driving, but old people can be stubborn too, and have to feel the consequences before they understand that they are a hazard. Too bad people get hurt that way.</p>

<p>Currently a breathalyser  doesn’t know when you drank, but it does measure a concentration that they claim tells them if we’re over the limit (a limit they decide). Ideally we need something like this for cannabis, unfortunately I see it appearing after legalisation and not before - as while it’s still illegal a test for weed only needs to say positive or negative.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The Dutch police uses a breathalyser too, but I believe only to determine whether you are above a certain limit. If you are, you are escorted to a police station and then you have your blood analyzed. The blood analysis is used to determine whether you were actually above the limit, because breathalysers can be prone to false positives.</p>
<p>I have no idea how the Dutch police tests drug use. I’ll look in to that. But I’m sure that they don’t check your fat cells or your hair, because they have to know that you used drugs in such a time frame that it <span class="bbcode-b">could</span> affect your driving abilities, not that you used it in the last month(s).</p>

<p>Prescription drugs are strictly regulated here. Altho, Sweden is the strictest country in the world when it comes to substances and traffic.</p>

<p>We have one law that states that:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 Dutch law:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>It is expressly forbidden to drive or for a driver to drive while he is in under the influence of a substance, which he knows or reasonably should know, that its use - whether or not combined with the use of another substance - may reduce ability to drive, or that he must be considered unable to properly drive</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>(Translated with Google Translate, so it may sound a bit odd)</p>
<p>The Dutch government even has a website about driving will using prescription drugs. But it all boils down to you being a responsible driver, as there is no way to prove whether you were under the influence of prescription drugs. There is no limit, like there is for alcohol. So it’s illegal, but you can do what you want because they can’t make a case against you.</p>

              <p>[quote=“R.I.P RSC, post:67, topic:365298”]I’m completely lost in this debate between Greeny and mapu. Greeny says that driving high is doable, as long as you’re not too stoned, and mapu says that it affects your reactions. Or am I missing something?</p>
<p>The keyword in Greeny’s opinion is ‘too’. This implies that there is a boundary, after which the effects of drugs do affect your driving abilities, but as long as you don’t cross a certain threshold you are safe. mapu believes this threshold lies between not being high at all, and having inhaled a pinch of smoke. Greeny believes that the threshold differs for each person.</p>
<p>Obviously, Greeny is right. Everyone should know their limits, and act accordingly. Speljohan is right when he says that when you’re driving a car it’s not just your own life, but also that of others. So everyone that feels that he is too high to be able to judge traffic situations, shouldn’t drive because he knows he passed his limit and shouldn’t endanger himself and others.</p>
<p>There’s one question left: Do people actually know their limits, and do they act accordingly? There are a lot of substances that affect your driving abilities, like alcohol, drugs (medicines), perhaps nicotine (are there any studies about this?), and the drugs discussed here. I know that alcohol makes you believe that you can do more then you actually can, so even one bottle of beer can make you a bad driver without even knowing it. Prescription drugs have a lot of negative effects, some make you drowsy, some make you nervous etc.</p>
<p>So how can you prevent substance related accidents from happening? By setting one standard: Don’t use and drive. Because it’s too much of a hassle to judge everyone individually, limits are set that apply to everyone. At the moment, alcohol is barely allowed, but prescription drugs are hardly regulated.</p>
<p>It’s a shame that a lot have to suffer because a few are irresponsible, but if it prevents accidents in exchange for me not being allowed to drive for a few hours I know what to pick.[/quote]Prescription drugs are strictly regulated here. Altho, Sweden is the strictest country in the world when it comes to substances and traffic.</p>
