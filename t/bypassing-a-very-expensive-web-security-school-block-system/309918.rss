    <title>Bypassing a very... Expensive &quot;Web Security&quot; (School block) system?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bypassing-a-very-expensive-web-security-school-block-system/309918</link>
    <description>I found out what system the school is using to block out many many websites. I have tried MANY MANY thing&#39;s to get passed this! So don&#39;t even try to mention any traditional methods of trying to bypass school blocks. I have also tried to get around the proxy but sadly I can&#39;t using all the methods I know of.

This is the system they use:
http://www.8e6security.com

I&#39;m thinking they bought the package for $14K
http://www.8e6security.com/8e6-Bundles.asp

Also I think they have probably purchased this:
http://www.8e6security.com/ProxyBlocker.asp

Anyone think of anyways to bypass this?</description>

<p>You better be prepared, my older brother works in the oilfield and makes excellent money, but at the cost of lots of sleep, and you may lose a lot of friends, Alberta is the best place to work for the oilfield, there are many different companies, Concord(CCS) Calfrac, etc. If you want any information on Canada’s high paying jobs contact me on irc, i live in Canada and i know very much about the oilfield industry and many other delivering industries.</p>

I plan on starting a business online and later moving on to larger things like department, but psychology has always been a thought of mine.

<p>It’s not like i’m trying to get on blocked websites for personal reasons… This blocks so much “.gov” domain’s have been known to be blocked.</p>

<p>Our school has a shit load of money and spends it on stupid stuff like this… I know… Fucking fourteen-thousand dollars. I am willing to take the punishment though. I’m failing this year anyways.</p>

              <p>I found out what system the school is using to block out many many websites. I have tried MANY MANY thing’s to get passed this! So don’t even try to mention any traditional methods of trying to bypass school blocks. I have also tried to get around the proxy but sadly I can’t using all the methods I know of.</p>
<p>This is the system they use:<br>
<a href="http://www.8e6security.com" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.8e6security.com</a></p>
<p>I’m thinking they bought the package for $14K<br>
<a href="http://www.8e6security.com/8e6-Bundles.asp" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.8e6security.com/8e6-Bundles.asp</a></p>
<p>Also I think they have probably purchased this:<br>
<a href="http://www.8e6security.com/ProxyBlocker.asp" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.8e6security.com/ProxyBlocker.asp</a></p>
<p>Anyone think of anyways to bypass this?</p>
