Atmos is a mock-up framework incorporating a few design ideas I wanted to try out. There is an online repository link above if you would like to leave any feedback. No designs are final yet and some parts of code haven&#39;t been tested, this is by no means a complete server.

It incorporates the new I/O system for networking since i&#39;ve always found it a little more flexible than Netty or Grizzly. The server currently only supports accepting connections.

Ill update the online repository as I go and once I have something besides a skeleton of code to show off i&#39;ll post some pictures. If you have any suggestions or critiques just leave a comment below.

[1/9/2014] : Login functional, design not yet completed.

The code is spaghetti right now due to the fact the original design had a few issues I  had to hard patch. Hoping to re-think some of the logic and have a cleaner interior in a few days.</description>

<p>The Login Alpha Design is completed and functional, however I may break it down a little bit more in the future. The structure for outgoing transmissions is also functional but I would like to tweek it in some places and make it quicker to implement new structures.</p>
