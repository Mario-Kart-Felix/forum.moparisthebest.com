    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-items-arent-being-added-to-the-shops-help-667-721/453057</link>
    <description>[size=14pt]for some reason my items aren&#39;t being added to the shops anymore: 
this is the shop: http://prntscr.com/db160 and see how there&#39;s a lot of room for more items.

and this is how the shop looks like in the file: http://prntscr.com/db17c
So the item i added in that shop was 5295 and it still doesn&#39;t work. I&#39;ve saved, compiled and no errors and still nothing. Please help ![/size]</description>
