    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ipod-touch/146535</link>
    <description>alright, im buying the 8GB iPod Touch in 3 days, and i wanted to know some more about it to make sure i want this. i have searched quite a bit on my own, looked at apple&#39;s documentation and such, and from what i have found, its amazing. the only problems people have with it is that it doesnt have some web-related apps the iPhone does. which i dont care about because i wouldnt use them. so if you know anything about the iPod Touch, post it. Good or bad. i want to know so i can back up my decision.</description>

              <p>yea, the fact that its $300 for 8gb of storage is the only draw back to me. otherwise everything else is pretty much perfect. and im so excited that im barely doing my school work =0. thats not good, but i can do it at a different time, seeing as as long as its in at the end of the semester, its in on time, lol.</p>

im goin for the touch because eventhough i have 100gb of music and video, i dont need it all. and with telekinesis and wifi and stuff, i dont need it. and its going to be the most customizable.[quote=“exps35, post:9, topic:146535”](plus you’ll be the coolest kid on the block, ya-rly).[/quote]</p>

              <p>Stupid Apple keeps releasing a new ipod every month and then they drop support for their old ones. Do they actually expect people to buy a new one every single month? I’ve got the very first type of ipod that came out and it works for me. I want portable music, it has portable music. But no, they don’t allow me to hook it up to their dock or stereo or portable brainfuck machines because it’s an older version.</p>

I was just browsing through apples products and thought it was an iPhone at first.  It looks pretty sweet. I’d say go for it.  Haven’t heard too much about it, but it looks pretty awesome.<br>

<p>yea, there was one store that had the 8gb, that was the apple store. and luckily i get 10% off because of their recycling program ( i have an old ipod that im trading in thats broken).<br>
so im pumped. and the ipod touch is basically the iphone without the phone features, and a few web apps (google earth, mail, etc.) however, because the touch runs a new version of OS X (1.1, the iphone runs 1.02) some apps for the iphone are saying they support the touch, which as far as i have read is a false claim, and when you install it, your ipod might crash. the only one i have seen that works, is telekinesis (its got an ipod touch version coming out).</p>
