    <title>How to make it so you need to use my client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-it-so-you-need-to-use-my-client/331231</link>
    <description>Well I want to make it so you need to use the client I made to join but any others don&#39;t allow. There is already code of it in the server but How do I change it to a new client?

Edit: Ok, I need it so I can make it so I reads my client as the only one to use on my server(Source) but the server is used with another client. How do change it?</description>
