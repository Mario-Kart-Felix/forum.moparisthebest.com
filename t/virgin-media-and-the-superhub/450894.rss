    <title>Virgin media and the superhub</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/virgin-media-and-the-superhub/450894</link>
    <description>Recently I&#39;ve been having connection issues to my not so super hub in fact my whole family have been having problems. It&#39;s unlikely but is anyone else having problems like the following:

Random disconnections when performing certain downloads.
Very bad download and upload speeds when you actually pay for 100mb connection.

I know a lot of you are American and probably wont use virgin so I could be wasting my time but whatever. Oh and please don&#39;t tell me to contact customer support because it is absolute shit: you always speak to foreign people who don&#39;t know anything except the bullshit they read of the scripts their given( I don&#39;t mean to offend anyone).</description>

              <p>The thing is it’s like there’s a cap on the amount I can download in a certain time. I have unlimited bandwidth and unlimited downloads but whenever I try to download a simple thing like winrar it downloads for a second then when It gets to like 800kb/s the download stops and my internet connection goes and then comes back.</p>
<p>Ollie - Have you ever had problems with customer support from virgin?</p>

              <p>Probably nothing related, but I too have Virgin Media (50MB) and have been having intermittent connection issues within the past few days. I don’t have a superhub though.</p>
