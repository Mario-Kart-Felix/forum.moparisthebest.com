    <description>Hello , im sick of this MASSIVE PRUNING . And mods dont just reply with a pointless &quot;leave then&quot;. Because there were [i]good[/i] , useful tutorials untill they were [b] ALL [/b] deleted. I really need to know how to make range projectiles fly through the air (and hit). I have searched through the net pulling my hair out just looking for this tutorial. Now that ALL tutorials have been deleted all the people are leaving (a good AND bad thing for us) and most of them cba to post the tutorial up again. I am sick of getting bad results on google , ask , My web search , yahoo , and other sites of theese search queries:
TUTORIAL+RANGE+PROJECTILES
RS2+PRIVATE+SERVER+TUTORIALS.

And do [b]not[/b] ask me to leave. The onlyway I will is be banned and I would hate for that to happen. I love mopar but I can see why people complain about it. How many times have I stuck up for you guys? , how many times have I helped beginners , and what do I get? I go on this site like every day just to help people , get tutorials :/ , and help people again. Please look at my [b]Last posts of this person[/b]for full info on how helpful I can be.

Look guys im sorry if this is too far, but I am sick of going to sythe , dodian and other sites whoose tutorials are just links to your tutorials. This is complete bs. Im asking you people to post back [b]your tutorials[/b] . I know it is a lot of effort and which you get sick of , but it will stop a lot of people going to other rs2 private server sites for tutorials. And it will help a lot of people trust me. 

Please , you ever friend,

EDIT: and when posting them back ... please abide by the rules and post proper , informal tutorials. Help mopar recover ;)</description>
