    <title>Compiler Error message?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/compiler-error-message/199168</link>
    <description>Ok i have a silabs source and i have the latest JDK but when i try to complie the server it says

&quot;You need to have Java files for this compiler to compile.
Press any key to continue . . .&quot;

i ran the variable changes for &quot;PATH&quot; and &quot;CLASSPATH&quot; i think there right but since this is my first server ive made by myself im not entirely sure.

I already made a forwarded port honestly DON&#39;T think thats the problem so dont post any smart comments its just extra info so that people that acually want to help others understand the full situation.

thank you for your time,
