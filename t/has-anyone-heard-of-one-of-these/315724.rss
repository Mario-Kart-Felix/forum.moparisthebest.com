    <title>Has anyone heard of one of these?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/has-anyone-heard-of-one-of-these/315724</link>
    <description>I was going to write a quick sucky program to solve algebra shit and show the work by just typing in the equation. But i was wondering if something like this already exists? It would make everything i already know alot easier by not wasting my time on problems.

The whole point of it is to show the work so i can get points for the answer.</description>

Close, i also need to be able to solve things like substitution etc Which involves 2 equations. And it doesn’t really show the work =[/quote]<br>
if you’re going to do things like show work then do it in parts, so say you have an eqautaion that has two steps to solve have the first box display the equation get the second box to display part of the equation being solved and then show the answer so you can show how it was done.<br>
like for example:<br>
x^2 + y^2 =25 and you need to find the centre<br>
box1: (X-A)^2+(Y-B)^2=r^2 as this is the forumla you would work on<br>
box2: (X-0)^2+(Y-0)^2=25<br>
centre point = (0,0)<br>
just display stages of the equation being done</p>
