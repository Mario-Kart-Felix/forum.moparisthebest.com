So you’re basically attempting to sell virtual goods for currency? You’ll add statistics to a Whip for $$? You should just go ahead and make special rings for donors that makes them invincible. Also, make it keep over everything on death and don’t tell your public players about it. Sell hidden statistics to accounts, you’ll make money. There’s some advice for you since this is all about the Benjamin for you. Hell, go ahead and sell Staff positions while you’re at it.<br>
