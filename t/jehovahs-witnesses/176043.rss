    <description>I while I learned about Jehova&#39;s Witnesses and then a few days ago my friend and I were driving somewhere that we go normally.  There was a church (or whatever they call it) for Jehova&#39;s Witnesses hiding in this little corner right next to the highway.  I&#39;ve driven past this spot probably 100 times and I never noticed!  Anyways any info on what these guys believe in and stuff would be appreciated.</description>

Fine in that it dosen’t hurt anyone except for the christian, sure, which I guess OK since people should be allowed to do whatever the hell they want… but:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Also some people are stronger with religion, and it makes them better people.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I have yet to see this.</p>
<p>[/quote]<br>
Well i sort of meant that by being happier it makes them better people.</p>
<p>E.g. Some people feel better that they aren’t going to just die and not exist, like my English teacher whom is old but is a christian, though she probably has nothing left to live for she still comes and teaches at a school and lives her life with the christian morals because it makes her happy to think there is something after death. [Which essentially makes her a stronger person, then say someone who has given up believe there will be something after death… therefore it may lead to depression]</p>
<p>If you get what i mean.[/quote]</p>
<p>my teachers a crazy christian english teacher too…</p>
<p>oh well</p>
<p>the jehovas witnesses are annoying and they copied the christians and put bans on everything…</p>
<p>BTW the most believed fairy tale out there is the theory of evolution. there is soo much evidence against it… theres more evidence against it than there is that george w. bush is the current president…</p>
<p>also for those who think im stupid because they teach evolution in schools and they wouldn’t do that unless it was true… read the book <span class="bbcode-u">Case for a Creator</span> by Lee Strobel</p>
<p>he was a journalist who believed in evolution and then something happened, and he questioned its validity, and he reasearched it found a lot of evidence for a god (not one in particular, just proof for inteligent design <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design</a> ) and now he wrote an unbiased book about the proof for god(s). he is not a crazy christian fanatic trying to convert the world. its unbiased and he interviewed people who are at the top of their career field like scientists, and they gave him information for his book. (also unbiased)</p>
<p>READ IT it will change your view on evolution and religeon.</p>

They want to make other people believe because christianity is the only true religion, and i learned that in sunday school last week. actually referring to it makes me feel so proud.</p>

<p>That is wrong, religion can’t be forced. You can believe in whatever you want, no one can make you believe. Same goes for education, it’s not forced but many people consider it to be due to standards constantly being enforced.</p>

<p>That goes to personal opinion. People consider drug use at different levels, some believe that smoking is bad, therefore smokers are bad. Some believe that smoking isn’t bad but weed is, so therefore potheads are bad.</p>

<p>It depends Mopman, you are a nice person when you want to be, but when you murder prostitutes and blame it on someone else, that’s just wrong.</p>

Well i sort of meant that by being happier it makes them better people.</p>
<p>E.g. Some people feel better that they aren’t going to just die and not exist, like my English teacher whom is old but is a christian, though she probably has nothing left to live for she still comes and teaches at a school and lives her life with the christian morals because it makes her happy to think there is something after death. [Which essentially makes her a stronger person, then say someone who has given up believe there will be something after death… therefore it may lead to depression]</p>
<p>If you get what i mean.</p>
