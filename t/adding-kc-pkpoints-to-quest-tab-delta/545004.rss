    <title>Adding KC + Pkpoints to quest tab [DELTA]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-kc-pkpoints-to-quest-tab-delta/545004</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;I am trying to add the bandos kill count and pk points to my quest tab.  I am not sure exactly what I have to do here.  I have googled around and found some stuff, but nothing that really explains what everything means.  I want it to come up as &quot;Killcount:##&quot;.  So can somebody please explain to me how to make it show the players live killcount.  

[code]c.sendQuest(&quot;Killcount:&quot;, 7333);
[/code]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

EDIT:
I figured out how to get it to show up now.  But is there anyway to make it update in real time?

EDIT:
Added the real time things under &quot;public boolean process()&quot; it all works now but is there a better place to put it?</description>

              <p>Well thanks for nothing and wasting my time.  By the way Sassafras isn’t Marijuana.  If you were trying to say my name is in reference to a drug you should have said snort some Molly.  But good try buddy <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Have a good one.</p>
