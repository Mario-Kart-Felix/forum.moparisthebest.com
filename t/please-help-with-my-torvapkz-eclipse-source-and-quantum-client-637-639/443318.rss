    <description>Hello everyone.
Well, I have been having issues lately with trying to find the ip. Can someone please help me? I searched for 127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0/localhost and there is nothing. There isn&#39;t any tutorial that helps. Can someone do that and please show me how to jar it. I feel Lazy.
