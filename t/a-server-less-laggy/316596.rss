    <title>A server less laggy</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-server-less-laggy/316596</link>
    <description>ok before i asked if i could run a server on a laptop, people replied probably not a good idea  :|. so i was wondering how i could make my server less laggy, i have a windows xp but its a family computer, therefor, theres alot of stuff on it. i need to know how to make my server less laggy. if it helps i do have an external hard drive if that pertains to this at all. Last thing is, is there a possibility i didnt portforward right cause i did just type in the the numbers they told me too.

thanks</description>
