    <description>
[ul][B][CENTER][SIZE=&quot;2&quot;]Hello there, I&#39;m going to make this as short as possible since I will edit and make this thread prettier later.
My name is Chris according to my username and I&#39;ve had some highs and alot of lows on this site. I&#39;ve been away for months inactive and abandonded this account and anything video game related due to the fact of me being scammed. I used to code Rsps, and habbo retros for the fun and joy of seeing others on my server. I had a very healthy server with new members coming by the dozens and a beautiful site created by me. I had to close the server due to the inefficient funds I had. After that I went solo on RuneScape I ended up having over 900m Wealth in just three weeks. Untill I was scammed by Gold4Rs,and I had efficient evidance yet they got away with it and unscaved. Enough about me lets move on.

The New Era 
I&#39;m looking to create a RSPS, I&#39;m looking for a joyful project where everyone can contribute ideas.
The name might be changed, depending on what we choose it to be.
We must work together via windows live messenger via group chat or dropbox
