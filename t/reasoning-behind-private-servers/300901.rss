    <title>Reasoning Behind Private Servers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/reasoning-behind-private-servers/300901</link>
    <description>I really wanted to start this discussion, as many people do not agree and have seperate opinions on this.

Would you consider a replicate of Runescape or a different server, such as Dodian, that has its own &quot;storyline&quot; and &quot;gameplay.&quot;

Some many great, and experienced, members of this community try to create servers, &quot;excactly like runescape.&quot; Is that really what people what? Or do they come to private servers because, &quot;We are different.&quot;

I mean, if you want to play Runescape, they shouldn&#39;t you just go play Runescape? But if you want something different, aren&#39;t you in the right place?
