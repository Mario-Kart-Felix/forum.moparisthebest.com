    <description>                                                       Info &amp; introduction
Game play in Fallout consists of traveling around the game world, visiting locations and interacting with the local inhabitants, and typically in real-time. Occasionally, inhabitants will be immersed in dilemmas which the player may choose to solve in order to acquire karma and experience points. Alternately, the player may choose to ignore requests for help, in which case he or she has the option of acting on behalf of an opposing faction, or purely in self-interest. Experience points may still be rewarded if the player acts for an opposing interest or in self-interest. Ultimately, players will encounter hostile opponents (if such encounters are not avoided using stealth or diplomacy), in which case they and the player will engage in combat.

Combat in the Fallout series is turn based. Fallout uses a point system wherein each turn multiple actions may be performed until all of the points have been expended. Different actions take up a different number of points, and the number of points that can be used may be affected by doing drugs, or perks interfering, hand to hand weapons usually offer different attack types, some like &quot;swing&quot; and &quot;thrust&quot; for knives. Characters can only equip at the most 2 weapons and the character can switch between them by clicking on their icons. The perception attribute determines characters &#39;sequence&#39; number which then determines the order of turns in combat; characters with a higher statistic in this attribute will be placed at an earlier position in the sequence of turns, and get new turns earlier. Perception also determines the maximmum range of all ranged weapons, and the chance to hit with them.

Characters are devided into different categories; attributes, skills, traits and perks. The highest level is 21, without modifying your game/patching. 

                                                              Game History 

Fallout 1 was released in 1997, The protagonist of the game is tasked with recovering a water chip to replace the chip that broke in his/her home, Vault 13

Fallout 2 was released in 1998, using a slightly-modified form of the engine used in the original Fallout. Taking place 80 years after the original game, Fallout 2 centers around a descendant of the Vault Dweller, the protagonist of Fallout. The player assumes the role of the Chosen One as he tries to save Arroyo, his village, after several years of drought, again a simple turn off of fallout 1&#39;s water chip.

Fallout 3 was released in 2008, he story picks up 30 years after the setting of Fallout 2 and 200 years after the nuclear war that devastated the game&#39;s world and allows the player to play as a vault-dweller whose father goes missing outside in the wasteland shortly after his or her 19th birthday, and who must venture out into the Wasteland around Washington, D.C. to find him.


In all honesty, Fallout 1 was an amazing game that was extremely thrilling, and had a basic storyline, and gave you everything you wanted in 1997, Fallout 2 &amp; Fallout 3 were completely fucking epic, Fallout 2 was much more easier to understand, was more simple and had a better storyline, i found fallout 1 much more difficult, Fallout 3 was a masterpiece, i haven&#39;t played any game on my xbox 360 more than Fallout 3, ive would spend all nighters just trying to max out my character and discover all the areas in the game (without using the perk that reveals all destinations) the VATS system in Fallout 3 felt much like the older series but much more visible and easier to cope with, Fallout 3 had a much better storyline ( i understand it was made ages after the other two). I have also found that Fallout 3 is much more fun on the PC some mods are completely epic.

Gears Of War ftw/halo[/quote]<br>
Lol’d. Gears of War’s campaign was awesome, and the only other good thing is horde(sp?). Halo sucks, gtf out of 2007.</p>
<p>I love Fallout 3. Heres some pictures of me playing today (yer fail quality caus i not hardcor enuf 2 play on pc)<br>

<p>Oblivion sucked penis hole. I played it for a week and was tired of it. None of the quests are unique, the people look like shit and they all share practically the same voice. Fallout is bigger than oblivion, people who say no can refer to Unhandled’s rank thread. Technically it is bigger, but all trees… In Fallout it is much more enjoyable to walk through the wasteland as you can see all the post war effects of things and find hideouts that have 1-3 raiders. After killing them you can look around their camp and see the attempts they’ve made to survive. In Oblivion its - HOLY FUCKING SHIT A GLOWING PORTAL.</p>
<p>And back to the quest thing, In oblivion the firstish quest is giving some bitchy old guy the amulet of kings… In Fallout, you defuse an Atomic bomb… Then you fight through DC to get to the Museum of Natural History to get the dish off of the Apollo(?) then put it on the top of the Washington monument so things can be broadcasted even further. Then you go through a simulation in Vault 112 which involves Tranquility lane which is being ran by an evil scientist who appears as a little girl named Betty in the simulation. Also add-ons suck for oblivion.</p>
<p>I don’t see how people would like oblivion more personally. It is beautiful, though. I enjoyed walking around in that too.</p>
<p>You also can’t do any of this in Oblivion:<br>

<p>Also, for anyone who wants a simple explanation to fallout this is it in a very slim nutshell: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QUjGxgbC68">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QUjGxgbC68</a></p>

              <pre><code>                                                   Info &amp; introduction
</code></pre>
<p>Game play in Fallout consists of traveling around the game world, visiting locations and interacting with the local inhabitants, and typically in real-time. Occasionally, inhabitants will be immersed in dilemmas which the player may choose to solve in order to acquire karma and experience points. Alternately, the player may choose to ignore requests for help, in which case he or she has the option of acting on behalf of an opposing faction, or purely in self-interest. Experience points may still be rewarded if the player acts for an opposing interest or in self-interest. Ultimately, players will encounter hostile opponents (if such encounters are not avoided using stealth or diplomacy), in which case they and the player will engage in combat.</p>
<p>Combat in the Fallout series is turn based. Fallout uses a point system wherein each turn multiple actions may be performed until all of the points have been expended. Different actions take up a different number of points, and the number of points that can be used may be affected by doing drugs, or perks interfering, hand to hand weapons usually offer different attack types, some like “swing” and “thrust” for knives. Characters can only equip at the most 2 weapons and the character can switch between them by clicking on their icons. The perception attribute determines characters ‘sequence’ number which then determines the order of turns in combat; characters with a higher statistic in this attribute will be placed at an earlier position in the sequence of turns, and get new turns earlier. Perception also determines the maximmum range of all ranged weapons, and the chance to hit with them.</p>
<p>Characters are devided into different categories; attributes, skills, traits and perks. The highest level is 21, without modifying your game/patching.</p>
<pre><code>                                                          Game History 
</code></pre>
<p>Fallout 1 was released in 1997, The protagonist of the game is tasked with recovering a water chip to replace the chip that broke in his/her home, Vault 13</p>
<p>Fallout 2 was released in 1998, using a slightly-modified form of the engine used in the original Fallout. Taking place 80 years after the original game, Fallout 2 centers around a descendant of the Vault Dweller, the protagonist of Fallout. The player assumes the role of the Chosen One as he tries to save Arroyo, his village, after several years of drought, again a simple turn off of fallout 1’s water chip.</p>
<p>Fallout 3 was released in 2008, he story picks up 30 years after the setting of Fallout 2 and 200 years after the nuclear war that devastated the game’s world and allows the player to play as a vault-dweller whose father goes missing outside in the wasteland shortly after his or her 19th birthday, and who must venture out into the Wasteland around Washington, D.C. to find him.</p>
<p>In all honesty, Fallout 1 was an amazing game that was extremely thrilling, and had a basic storyline, and gave you everything you wanted in 1997, Fallout 2 &amp; Fallout 3 were completely fucking epic, Fallout 2 was much more easier to understand, was more simple and had a better storyline, i found fallout 1 much more difficult, Fallout 3 was a masterpiece, i haven’t played any game on my xbox 360 more than Fallout 3, ive would spend all nighters just trying to max out my character and discover all the areas in the game (without using the perk that reveals all destinations) the VATS system in Fallout 3 felt much like the older series but much more visible and easier to cope with, Fallout 3 had a much better storyline ( i understand it was made ages after the other two). I have also found that Fallout 3 is much more fun on the PC some mods are completely epic.</p>
