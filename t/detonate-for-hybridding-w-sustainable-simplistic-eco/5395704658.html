        <p>[quote=“Vain_, post:19, topic:539570”]yes anyone can obtain it; but what’s the point in making players fight revenants for a small chance at getting gear they:<br>
1: cannot wear<br>
2: cannot sell unless to a donator (which will still not be very much profit)[/quote]</p>
<p>Technically, if this gear is as good as you say it is, I can see people paying a bit for it. You might have fought someone who had PvP armor because people were able to spawn it at one point, that’s been patched now and those items have been removed (you might have thought the PvP armor was more common than it actually is).</p>
<p>[quote=“Vain_, post:19, topic:539570”]your goal is to make pvp run the server, and slowly generate an economy - but:<br>
1: the only current methods for making profit to new players is<br>
a: thieving (which is in wilderness, and has horrible profit yield)<br>
b: bossing (many bosses are glitched/don’t drop, only ones that work are either too OP for beginning gear, or in the wilderness which is just pointless because they can just be pked after getting loot.)<br>
c: skilling (not easy to profit, and not encouraged because it’s a “pk” server)<br>
2: donators have access to better gear, which leads to them killing new/other players (resulting in them losing their ‘banks’ and possibly RQ’ing)[/quote]</p>
<p>Thieving makes an upwards of ~30m per hour (tested). That’s enough to buy a max mage set/a barrows tank set  + have plenty of money left over. The idea isn’t for money to be extremely hard on the server; the whole concept is it’s a PK server. The addition of an economy was to add (some sort of) worth to the items people obtain from PK’ing. Yes, many of the bosses and skill-based money making methods are located in the wilderness, but I expect people to go prepared to these locations rather than complain about their setting.</p>
<p>The idea is for people to go around PK’ing, not for people to go around skilling/bossing. If you want to skill/boss, you’re free to, but, if you don’t go prepared, that’s not to say someone will just show up and kill you.</p>
<p>Also, not that many bosses are broken. The ones that Kolodion teleports you are the fully functional ones, and some of the command ones were still going through testing, but other than Nex they more or less work as intended. Corp Beast actually yields a lot of money (upwards of +400m if you get something like an elysian sigil etc…)</p>
<p>[quote=“Vain_, post:19, topic:539570”]yes; the bonuses are nearly identical to that of RuneScape’s - but is the combat? no. i can’t take a dds and vesta, and go 2-spec someone in bandos to death. especially when they have rocktails.</p>
<p>i’m not trying to bash your server, just trying to allow you to fix it. especially since the <span class="bbcode-i">benefits</span> are so <span class="bbcode-u">cheap</span> to gather, it makes it look a bit like you’re making the ‘server’ based around the donators, as they <span class="bbcode-b">will run the wilderness</span>[/quote]</p>
<p>No, they won’t… PvP armor isn’t as common as you think (nor as powerful as you think), as a matter of fact; nobody has a full set right now. You <span class="bbcode-b">may</span> have seen a full set of Statius because it was spawnable, but those items have been removed and it’s been made unspawnable again.</p>

<p>The contributor rank wasn’t really needed at all to begin with (except to pay for server costs).
