You will start out in Edgeville. This will be your starter inventory:

Since this is a PK server, I tried to be lenient about it - but at the same time, fair. The money in your inventory is going to be very valuable because it is going to be needed to basically use anything on the game. You will be able to use the ::item command to spawn items for yourself, but every item will have a price behind it. You will also have the capability of selling that item back using the ::sellitem command for a reduced price.

For an item list, I reccommend [URL=http://&quot;http://www.itemdb.biz&quot;]www.itemdb.biz[/URL] or use the ::itemsearch command feature already instilled into the game:

There will be a few NPC&#39;s around the corners of the bank:

These NPCs (in order), will most likely be highly used during your time spent playing [COLOR=red]Detonate[/COLOR].

Mandrith will exchange artifacts obtained from PK&#39;ing for coins and will also alter exp rates (for RS styled exp drops. Technically, exp rates dont matter as you will be able to set all your levels anyway.)

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/2b1bc2c42f6089480ea48e999d4e354e.png[/img]

The wizard will be your trusty steed - he will be able to teleport you to a variety of places such as East dragons, West dragons, MB, or even 50 portals.

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/8febc600f7c48a870c7cdb941d973230.png[/img]

The general will hold all your untradable and tradable items needs - items like d defenders, torsos, and AGS&#39;s will be obtained from his PKP shop. He will also exchange each PK point you have at a [COLOR=#FF0000]1:150k coins [/COLOR]exchange rate

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/e1ae6d4442794eb6cc730193c3f377e7.png[/img]

The makeover mage will... well... let you change your character&#39;s appearance.

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/e51f3e195f39cc33f07e130d5146028d.png[/img]

The wise old man (who is truly wise), has some pre-set account builds in case you&#39;re too lazy to set the levels yourself.

The combat instructor will teleport you to an arena where you can practice fighting an automated Non-Player character (NPC) that constantly changes combat styles.
[B]NOTE: You will also be able to obtain any of the armor he is wearing if you manage to kill him - he is pretty difficult to kill but it is doable, considering bandos will be worth about 80m I think it&#39;s fair the way it is right now.[/B]

Anyways, that&#39;s pretty much the general layout you should be expecting. 
Some skills do exist (like FM, Herblore, Cooking, Smithing, Crafting) and plenty of other buyables - and you can buy them via spawning, but they do not serve much relevance as of right now.

As for PvM, things like ::armadyl, ::bandos, ::saradomin, ::zamorak, ::kbd, etc exist, but are not fully implemented into the live game (consider them beta features). If people start asking for interactive PvM content, I&#39;d be more than happy to add ways of obtaining the current items from PVP into PvM.

The general idea is to get people PK&#39;ing in all areas of the wilderness, and for actual cash to serve some sort of relevance (which I am confident that it will)

NOTE: Since votes just reset, there will be some temporary vote rewards - masks + crackers (which you pop for chances of partyhats) in the vote shop:

              <p>[quote=“Vain_, post:19, topic:539570”]yes anyone can obtain it; but what’s the point in making players fight revenants for a small chance at getting gear they:<br>

2: cannot sell unless to a donator (which will still not be very much profit)[/quote]</p>
<p>Technically, if this gear is as good as you say it is, I can see people paying a bit for it. You might have fought someone who had PvP armor because people were able to spawn it at one point, that’s been patched now and those items have been removed (you might have thought the PvP armor was more common than it actually is).</p>
<p>[quote=“Vain_, post:19, topic:539570”]your goal is to make pvp run the server, and slowly generate an economy - but:<br>
1: the only current methods for making profit to new players is<br>
a: thieving (which is in wilderness, and has horrible profit yield)<br>
b: bossing (many bosses are glitched/don’t drop, only ones that work are either too OP for beginning gear, or in the wilderness which is just pointless because they can just be pked after getting loot.)<br>
c: skilling (not easy to profit, and not encouraged because it’s a “pk” server)<br>
2: donators have access to better gear, which leads to them killing new/other players (resulting in them losing their ‘banks’ and possibly RQ’ing)[/quote]</p>
<p>Thieving makes an upwards of ~30m per hour (tested). That’s enough to buy a max mage set/a barrows tank set  + have plenty of money left over. The idea isn’t for money to be extremely hard on the server; the whole concept is it’s a PK server. The addition of an economy was to add (some sort of) worth to the items people obtain from PK’ing. Yes, many of the bosses and skill-based money making methods are located in the wilderness, but I expect people to go prepared to these locations rather than complain about their setting.</p>
<p>The idea is for people to go around PK’ing, not for people to go around skilling/bossing. If you want to skill/boss, you’re free to, but, if you don’t go prepared, that’s not to say someone will just show up and kill you.</p>
<p>Also, not that many bosses are broken. The ones that Kolodion teleports you are the fully functional ones, and some of the command ones were still going through testing, but other than Nex they more or less work as intended. Corp Beast actually yields a lot of money (upwards of +400m if you get something like an elysian sigil etc…)</p>
<p>[quote=“Vain_, post:19, topic:539570”]yes; the bonuses are nearly identical to that of RuneScape’s - but is the combat? no. i can’t take a dds and vesta, and go 2-spec someone in bandos to death. especially when they have rocktails.</p>
<p>i’m not trying to bash your server, just trying to allow you to fix it. especially since the <span class="bbcode-i">benefits</span> are so <span class="bbcode-u">cheap</span> to gather, it makes it look a bit like you’re making the ‘server’ based around the donators, as they <span class="bbcode-b">will run the wilderness</span>[/quote]</p>
<p>No, they won’t… PvP armor isn’t as common as you think (nor as powerful as you think), as a matter of fact; nobody has a full set right now. You <span class="bbcode-b">may</span> have seen a full set of Statius because it was spawnable, but those items have been removed and it’s been made unspawnable again.</p>

<p>I think you’re over exaggerating.</p>
<p>These are the vesta plateskirt/bandos tassets comparison:</p>
<p><img src="http://gyazo.com/dbab102c1656cfa048402a7620c9f393.png" alt width="" height=""><img src="http://gyazo.com/fb2c15bd018e9df8763dcf8bb13b87e4.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>There is literally a 1 strength bonus difference (very slight attack bonus difference), and a comparable defence bonus difference. If you’re trying to say Vesta changes up the playing field other than giving a slight defense advantage, you’re kind of stretching it.</p>

<p>Exactly; and since they’re wanted by contributors, regular players could sell it to them for money… therefore providing a benefit for both contributors and regular players alike.</p>

<p>If we were to argue semantics, the correct terminology would be “equippable content”. Anyone can obtain PvP armor; the only proposed solution I could see is perhaps giving both types of players access to these items, but making the degrade rate 10x faster (or something along those lines) for regular players.</p>

<p>That’s the point :p, he uses all 3 combat styles, you’re allowed to pray on him and such</p>
<p>Anyway, artifact prices from PK’ing for exchange at Mandrith have been significantly upped.</p>

<p>[SIZE=4][B][U]Layout[/U][/B][/SIZE]</p>
<p>You will start out in Edgeville. This will be your starter inventory:</p>
<p><img src="http://gyazo.com/7e930d9330b6017ea9f3897cd1cad9dd.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Since this is a PK server, I tried to be lenient about it - but at the same time, fair. The money in your inventory is going to be very valuable because it is going to be needed to basically use anything on the game. You will be able to use the ::item command to spawn items for yourself, but every item will have a price behind it. You will also have the capability of selling that item back using the ::sellitem command for a reduced price.</p>
<p><img src="http://oi60.tinypic.com/nqa2e0.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><img src="http://oi61.tinypic.com/9ay6hh.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>For an item list, I reccommend [URL=http://“<a href="http://www.itemdb.biz" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.itemdb.biz</a>”]www.itemdb.biz[/URL] or use the ::itemsearch command feature already instilled into the game:</p>
<p><img src="http://gyazo.com/98ab7e1f653779a41dd9f7c0c4996611.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>There will be a few NPC’s around the corners of the bank:</p>
<p><img src="http://gyazo.com/f476850701a1b96a0140042421358293.png" alt width="" height=""><img src="http://gyazo.com/7e62a49c737356f89e6f48df2a79d186.png" alt width="" height=""><img src="http://gyazo.com/2ea7841427704da827033afe842a6b10.png" alt width="" height=""><img src="http://gyazo.com/ea1f1fbb57971d8150c669fa6eb05d99.png" alt width="" height=""><img src="http://gyazo.com/b37efa988c0201938ff828a35c5c3026.png" alt width="" height=""><img src="http://gyazo.com/7bd41ba48c848c6c396fe786c53a557c.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>These NPCs (in order), will most likely be highly used during your time spent playing [COLOR=red]Detonate[/COLOR].</p>
<p>Mandrith will exchange artifacts obtained from PK’ing for coins and will also alter exp rates (for RS styled exp drops. Technically, exp rates dont matter as you will be able to set all your levels anyway.)</p>
<p><img src="http://gyazo.com/2b1bc2c42f6089480ea48e999d4e354e.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>The wizard will be your trusty steed - he will be able to teleport you to a variety of places such as East dragons, West dragons, MB, or even 50 portals.</p>
<p><img src="http://gyazo.com/8febc600f7c48a870c7cdb941d973230.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>The general will hold all your untradable and tradable items needs - items like d defenders, torsos, and AGS’s will be obtained from his PKP shop. He will also exchange each PK point you have at a [COLOR=#FF0000]1:150k coins [/COLOR]exchange rate</p>
<p><img src="http://gyazo.com/e1ae6d4442794eb6cc730193c3f377e7.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>The makeover mage will… well… let you change your character’s appearance.</p>
<p><img src="http://gyazo.com/e51f3e195f39cc33f07e130d5146028d.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>The wise old man (who is truly wise), has some pre-set account builds in case you’re too lazy to set the levels yourself.</p>
<p><img src="http://gyazo.com/7826435532104e436dfda15298642339.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>The combat instructor will teleport you to an arena where you can practice fighting an automated Non-Player character (NPC) that constantly changes combat styles.<br>
[B]NOTE: You will also be able to obtain any of the armor he is wearing if you manage to kill him - he is pretty difficult to kill but it is doable, considering bandos will be worth about 80m I think it’s fair the way it is right now.[/B]</p>
<p><img src="http://gyazo.com/73763bdd699e5b2cf366f6166a6728d2.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
<img src="http://gyazo.com/130459a8702dcf8339a934524f2d50e5.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Anyways, that’s pretty much the general layout you should be expecting.<br>
Some skills do exist (like FM, Herblore, Cooking, Smithing, Crafting) and plenty of other buyables - and you can buy them via spawning, but they do not serve much relevance as of right now.</p>
<p>As for PvM, things like ::armadyl, ::bandos, ::saradomin, ::zamorak, ::kbd, etc exist, but are not fully implemented into the live game (consider them beta features). If people start asking for interactive PvM content, I’d be more than happy to add ways of obtaining the current items from PVP into PvM.</p>
<p>The general idea is to get people PK’ing in all areas of the wilderness, and for actual cash to serve some sort of relevance (which I am confident that it will)</p>
<p><img src="http://gyazo.com/eb0d3c39ada6b55b6f23a2433267a34c.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>NOTE: Since votes just reset, there will be some temporary vote rewards - masks + crackers (which you pop for chances of partyhats) in the vote shop:</p>
