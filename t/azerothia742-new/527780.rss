    <description>Hi everybody! My name is Demon. Me and my friend have started a new server for you guys to enjoy! The revision is 742 and it has alot of EoC items and NPC&#39;s Our server has perfect PvP/PvM. So whatever your taste is, It will surely be filled on our magnificent server! I&#39;m working on forums and a webclient as you&#39;re reading this. So be sure to stop on by today. I&#39;m on mostly all day, Because I work from home.

Our server has alot of boss teleports, Above 15!
And 10 PvP Teleports including Revenants with their PvP Armor drops!

Come on by and play awhile!
