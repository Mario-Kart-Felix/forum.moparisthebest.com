    <description>Hey hows it going?
Well I thought I would offer something.
Need a host feel free to contact me. 
Here are my specs.
I currently live in the USA and get a 10 mb connection through charter communications.
I played runescape since I was 16... to about the age of 20. I am currently 21.
I have ran a few private helbreath servers... and First Star online, not doing much more then hosting.
I currently have pen4  , 3.4ghz (overclocked) with 1024 MB of DDR2. I have a  80Gig hard drive almost totally clean.  
I rarely shut my computer off, or use it for more then my online schooling.
Me and a few freinds built it and theirs cause we know the value of ( not buying a premade one) and building your own. I do have an msn... you can get via looking at my profile or feel free to message me on here, I will active on here keeping updated cause I have always thought private runescape servers would rock.
