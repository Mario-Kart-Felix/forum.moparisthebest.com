    <title>Why not?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-not/447506</link>
    <description>This community has all this talent. we have server Programmers, 2d artist, 3d model maker, and client programmers. But Most of it is  wasted. All these RS remakes are great and all, but if you really want it that bad just play RS. Why dont the community come together and a site server? Use the RS world. but with own models, story line, revised game engine, interfaces. Just make our own game. Im not talking about just putting and npc here and their like most of the servers today. Im talking about a full scale game. I know it will take time. But it think if the community could come together and pull something like this off. It could take us to the next level.</description>

              <p>Why not?</p>
<p>Because this has been discussed over 9000 times before. And your idea is terrible ‘use the RS world’ but remake the game engine and everything else? Are you insane? The idea for a community game has been discussed already though, and if you really want to get it going you’re going to have to wait, there is too much going on right now anyways. If you want to look, do a search for Moparmon, and check on gamedev.</p>

Was insinuating he search for what he posted, not the title of the thread. Thought this was obvious enough, guess not.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

<p>Thats what takes the community to the next level. I know it wont be as good a jagex, But you have to start somewhere. Runescape started of as a (in my opinion) shitty 2d game. Look where it is now. runescape started with just three people i think, but we could have a whole community. If everyone gets the right mindset and be mature about it we could all cooperate. Yes some worker at jagex studios does what they do for the money. but some do it just to make a great game.</p>

All these RS remakes are great and all, but if you really want it that bad just play RS. Why dont the community come together and a site server? Use the RS world. but with own models, story line, revised game engine, interfaces. Just make our own game. Im not talking about just putting and npc here and their like most of the servers today. Im talking about a full scale game. I know it will take time. But it think if the community could come together and pull something like this off. It could take us to the next level.</p>
