    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-npcs-at-slayer-give-exp-instead-of-chests/345527</link>
    <description>[size=14pt][font=impact][center]hey guys, i really need to fix this~~~ i wanna make slayer really challenging and for that i need to make it so that instead of clicking a stupid chest, the player kills NPCs for slayer EXP can someone just post the script or whatever
e.g.   ifNpcID= 41
ifNPCdead(addexp[slayer]= 50)
by the way i have NO IDEA what the script is, im just trying to say what im thinking of to give you a better picture in your head of what i&#39;m trying to say.
Thanks for your help and please respond soon! [/center] [/font] [/size]</description>
