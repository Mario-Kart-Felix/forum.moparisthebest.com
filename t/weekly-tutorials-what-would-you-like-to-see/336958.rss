    <title>Weekly tutorials: What would you like to see?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/weekly-tutorials-what-would-you-like-to-see/336958</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve have been thinking of having me, Archer, and Dylan create weekly tutorials for you guys on basic model creating. We would like to cover stuff that is somewhat unique, nothing huge (ex: cars).

So what would you like to see? Battleaxe&#39;s, guns, what else? We need some ideas, but nothing that has already been covered in CJ&#39;s tutorial. We will also find cool weapons on google (or provided by you guys) and guide you through creating them. Hopefully you guys will pick up some techniques we use and be able to use them in your own creations, and thus become better at problem solving when creating your own models.</description>

              <p>Also one of my tutorials I would like to see, mainly because I would like to know how to do, is make custom animations and GFXes integrated into special attacks such as the saradomin godsword special, but customized for your own specially made weapons (I think I could figure this out on my own, but other people might not be able to. ;)) . Custom animations like you make a weapon and you have a custom wield emote to go along with it. I’m not sure if this is model related, but I think there is no other category for it besides maybe client hacking.</p>

              <p>I like it. I would step away from the aspect of weapons, and as said above, definately armor. As we learned in the platebody contest, nothing came out to well. The helm contest was decent, and we are yet to see platelegs. Maybe some other stuff like npc’s, or objects. Possibly move into the aspect of animating spells or something?</p>

i think you should just add a tutorials subsection. Makes things alot more organized…<br>
[/quote]<br>
Good idea, but there’s a fault. We don’t want to divide the section up any more than it already is. Help and requests were moved because they were somewhat irrelevant on the board. For now, if you’d like to write your own tutorials feel free to post them in the main models section ;).[/quote]<br>
Hey, look at it this way. at least these forums aren’t as unorganized as rune- server</p>

i recommend doing different kind of armors, helms, plates, leggings. and maybe some tutorials on how to keep models clean, moparscapians arent the best at that haha<br>
[/quote]<br>
This idea I like a lot. And maybe a couple of guides on showing how to create a little bit of complex helmets without tracing (more than just a cap), and platebody/platelegs. IMO those are the hardest and I would love to see a guide on those.[/quote]<br>
Agreed. Ill most likely make tutorials that involve modeling around a blank runescape character, that way the objects fit well and should animate (is it possible to animate 100% custom armor?).</p>
