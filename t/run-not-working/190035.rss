    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/run-not-working/190035</link>
    <description>ok this is REALLY PISSING ME OFF NOW. my server would run last night however compile didnt work, now it won&#39;t even run the server it just pops up for like 1 second then goes away
YES I HAVE JDK 6U5 AND I HAVE THE CLASSPATHS SET CORRECTLY!!!!!!!i&#39;ve gotten like 3 codes to replaces compile and run with NONE of them work. Also I&#39;ve been suggested that it was an error in an edit I made. Obviously it&#39;s not because i downloaded an all new source and it still didn&#39;t run correctly. i really need help PLEASE omg this is so frustrating! MSN would be great: Kaelen@live.com

<p>Lawl… Your server isnt running because you fucked up your environmental variables… change your path back to its normal version… and you will be fine…</p>
<p>Download jdk with netbeans… i didnt have to change my environmental variables after id di that and compilers work perfectly.</p>
