    <title>PI How could I set the gameframe</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-how-could-i-set-the-gameframe/542910</link>
    <description>The source is Vistex. if anyone knows how to set the gameframe automatically for login to 474, that&#39;d be nice. I changed the sprites to the older gameframe but the actual frame&#39;s buttons are 562. and the problem is, my cache i don&#39;t think has the older(474) sprites and idk if the client has the codes in there to use them.  Does anyone have a tut they could send me, I tried this one and got 100 errors. http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-client/tutorials/458411-pi-adding-525-gameframe-orbs.html</description>
