    <title>Help Updating the Alternate Slave Bot</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-updating-the-alternate-slave-bot/1541</link>
    <description>[quote=&quot;BAsh, post:1, topic:1524&quot;]This is my version of SlaveBot. It dosn&#39;t contain any IMPSoft code (Except the free scripts), and I have not seen the slaveBot code or even have a copy of the program on my computer.

For those of you with a conscience this is my version of SlaveBot without stealing from any of its authors.

It has a console, script, and control tab for easy gaming, thus reducing cpu power spent on the command console window, have a look at the attached image.

Windows users:
Compile as usual, then click on the shortcut &quot;Aryan2&quot;. if it dosn&#39;t work, open the properties and change the Target box so there is no path infront of the word &quot;javaw&quot;, click okay and try again.

Linux users: 
I&#39;m not sure if there is a version of javaw available, if so juct click on the Aryan2.desktop file and it should work.

Enjoy[/quote]

I have downloaded the above bot and when I run it, it says Runescape has been updated. Does this bot or client have to be updated just like normal Aryan? If so can anyone show me how to update it using Mopars updater (when the revision is done) or can someone update it? Thx.</description>

              <p>I’m sure it could be manually updated, however I have no experience with Java, but I think that manually updating would be hard work and might take some time. However once Mopar’s auto-updater is working again it will probably be updated ASAP so just hold on, you’ll have it soon enough! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
