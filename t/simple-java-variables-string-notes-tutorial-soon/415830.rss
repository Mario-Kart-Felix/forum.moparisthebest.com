    <description>[u][b]Main Variables -
[/b][/u]
int = set of numeric numbers from -24billion to 24 billion
String = set of alphabetic or symbols
char = a single valued letter or symbol with single qoutation marks
boolean = used to store the value of true or false
byte = any number from the range of -128 to 127
short = it&#39;s smaller then the int but larger then the byte, stores numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
long = typically used to store numbers too big for the int to hold, stores numbers from -9.22 quintillion to 9.22 quintillion
float = stands for floating-point variables, stores decimal point numbers.
Final int = forgetten what it stands for lol... it&#39;s been a while...

[u][b]Naming Variables -[/b][/u]
variables can be named with any alphabetic or numeric value, but can
only be named with certain symbols, these are: (the underscore (_))
and (the dollar sign ($)).
NOTE: Java is case sensative when it comes to variables.

[u][b]Using special characters in Strings -[/b][/u]


\&#39;		Single qoutation mark
\&quot;		Double qoutation mark
\n		New line
\\		Back slash
\t		Tab
\r		Carriage return
\f		Formfeed
\b		Backspace
	(i think that&#39;s all of them... :s )
You can use System.out.println() or System.out.print() .. but the second
one is recommended if you&#39;re using a character with the String...
if you just want a new line i recommend using println with \n char...
for example:
System.out.println(&quot;music by \nMichael Nyman&quot;)
This will look like this:

Music By
Michael Nyman

When you work with system.out.println() and work with strings in other
ways, you can paste two strings together by using +, the same operator
that is used to add numbers.

The + operator has a different meaning in relation with Strings...
It can add two strings together or make one big strings out of
two smaller ones... But i don&#39;t want to get too into detail about that
just yet...

[i][b]If you think i should make a squence of tutorials from the very very
start of java programming then vote above, keep in mind, this will be
for people who don&#39;t know anything at all about java.[/b][/i]  ;D
