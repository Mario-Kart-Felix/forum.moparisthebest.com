    <title>[Need Hoster] Need A Good Hoster Around 24/7 Or More!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-hoster-need-a-good-hoster-around-24-7-or-more/233722</link>
    <description>Hey,
         Myself Anonymous here.

After loads of requests from my members for us becoming 24/7 i thought i would ask around abit. So the 1st place i thought i&#39;d ask if here.
So, is anyone here willing to run a server maybe not 24/7 but at least around 24/5.

For me details you could come online and check it out, or you could check out the website - BloodThirst.TK, And The Server Ip - Bloodthirst.no-ip.org, Dont try to crash it ill just ip bann you and add you to my big list in peer guardian.

Thanks!</description>
