-STARTERS-

Ok so i went to the files and tryed deleting the 2 starters and got errors. but then i found theres a folder. and got really confused. can some 1 show me a turtorial or tell me what to do. because it connected to files because its based on ip addreses.


-SOUL SPLIT-
Ok so i changed smite into soul split and everything is good except adding 1/5 hp given to you when damage to enemy any one know how i can add? also if u know the gfx of the circles around the players when the hp is given to you and like the 2 air boltsd go into u and come back and heal u? if u know what im saying.
