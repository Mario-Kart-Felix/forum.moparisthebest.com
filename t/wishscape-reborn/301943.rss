    <description>Well some of you may know WishScape From like 2008. It was based of czar. Probly was the best czar server in those days. It holded 120+ with no lagg or crash. Well I quited and shut down the server. Now im back and working on a new project. The base is Devolution 2.6. [b]NOTE: Do not pm and ask can I help you code it. I don&#39;t accept and invites. Im doing this solo so it wont fail like most projects do. Some get relased and some just die.[/b] Ok so my youtube account is Youtube.com/WishScape I will be posting my progress there. Here are some futures.
