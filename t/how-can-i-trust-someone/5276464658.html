        <pre><code> The thing is, no matter what you have the person agree to sign, whether it be a legally binding contract with all of the paper work, or partaking in a blood oath (ha). You can never truly trust anyone you know online. Also, if crackers are after your info, they will find something if you are a careless interwebber. It probably won't be vital information, but it can lead to other things and add up to I.D. crimes in some cases. There is also some real life activity required or this simply isn't as effective as it could be. 

 People usually get "hacked", or cracked due to their own errors or stupidity. It's often times a combination of the two. What is the best and most secure way to be sure that your work is safe and sound with It's current Developers? Having two Source/Client Developers who know both of the subjects very well and like them equally is a solid plan. If something goes missing or anything is tampered with in some manner, you will KNOW that it was not you. You'll most likely be able to figure out if your security has been exploited or compromised at some point by a 3rd party wolf. It's not hard and default operating system programs + honey pot will most likely alert the user in some way. 

 One of the principle keys in these situations, is to remember, that you NEVER EVER give out your Dedicated Host/Virtual Private Server/Virtual Private Network/Host/Private Network/etcetera; information. This is vital to remember. Do not ever give out personal or critical information that could possibly be an asset to anyone working against you or your operations.  If you give out this information to a potential 'developer' you just met who is a budding 16 year old social engineer and just played you like a piano -- within 7 business days, you will receive a certificate via the U.S. Postal service which confirms your eligibility for metal disability assistance 
</code></pre>
<p>IF YOU DO THIS YOU’RE |=|_|(|&lt;1||9 1237@12|)3|). ^^</p>
<pre><code> It's also important that your other Developer should have the same common interests and goals as you. If you both are working towards the same goals, then you will be able to work together successfully WITH the proper communication, which is vital to any partnership; ever. Multiple Developers with entirely different styles, intentions, visions, plans, and programming techniques does NOT in the end create a very solid product. What's that? You want some examples? Look at pretty much every R.S.P.S. ever. There you go. champ.
</code></pre>
<p>P.S. Check High Scores for SQLi vulnerabilities. This is NOT a good security loophole to have and is well known. Most security issues you encounter will be able to be solved with a little effort and due diligence to search for solutions. If you are stuck with a problem, the odds are in your favor that another person has been confronted with the same problem under matching or similar circumstances. You should always keep this in mind as it would be advantageous for your projects. Another tip I can offer to always remember, is to not get frustrated and hear others out. Do NOT have too big of an ego, don’t be very penisy, etcetera. Everyone on these forums should always remember the rule:  No matter how much one knows there is always someone who knows much more.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">I don’t endorse any of this. Just chatting about this as a casual subject</span></p>
<p>TL;DR</p>
<blockquote>You can't ever truly trust anyone you meet online and don't know in real life. Even if you know them in real life, you should still be wary. You can never underestimate another person's greed or how many morals they will ignore and step over to achieve what they work towards. You should always be a cautious intererweb user and there are hundreds of websites upon hundreds of websites who specialize in giving advice on this very subject. You should check them out.</blockquote>   
<p><em><strong><span class="bbcode-b">Non-Lecture Version</span></strong></em>_</p>
<p>You can’t ever trust another person 100%. Get to know them, call them out and give them tests and situational errors to resolve in Java. Ask them what to do in certain situations and get familiar with their persona and them in general, or at least the persona that they attempt to give off. You’re much better off if you can bring a lot to the Development table so-to-speak and partner up with a well-known programmer who has a lot of experience in both Client and Server-sided Design and Development.</p>
