              <p>I’ve no idea, I don’t tend to use MyBB a lot. The only person on mopar I can think of that actually uses them right now is JaydenD12, he owns Epicurus. I’m sure they use MyBB so he’d be better answering your questions.</p>
<p>Towards the 3rd party support site, just google and visit whichever one fits your fancy.</p>
