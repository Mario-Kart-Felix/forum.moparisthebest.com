    <title>667 new rsps (Unamed yet) looking for one other developer</title>

    <description>Hello, i&#39;m posting this because I have been having troubles trying to find someone to aid in my quest of owning/hosting a Private server.
[size=10pt][b]This will be an economy server[/b][/size]

[b]How this will work-[/b]
[i]You will not be &quot;lower in command&quot; to me[/i]
-you would be given just as much credit as me.
-If either of us make changes to the server we will let each other know  (if one of us is offline)
-We will both be working on a server that is planned to be hosted on a vps. [b]I&#39;ve already bought my vps this month[/b]

[b]*REQUIREMENTS*[/b]
-You must have general knowledge of 667 source/client
-You also need to be active

The plan is to not worry about extra content... I want to focus mainly on base content such as : Home location, Start Location,  Respawn Location, ect..
You will be given the same rights as me...meaning me and you will be equal.

Please if anyone is interested comment on here.</description>
