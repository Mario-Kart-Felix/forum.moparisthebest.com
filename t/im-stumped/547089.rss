    <description>[CENTER]Thanks for whoever reads this and contributes and helps me, because this is a pain and I&#39;ve never had an issue like this. Whoever can fully help me through it will get a Thanks + Rep I know that&#39;s not anything special, but I mean I don&#39;t really have any money to show my thanks in that way...

So what&#39;s happening is I&#39;ve been working on my Pk/Eco Server for a while using Taco/Mr. Classic/Cookies n Milk&#39;s, &quot;Biohazard v2&quot; release that was released to Rune-Server near February. When working on it I finally got done with the source side and I went over to the client side and wanted to add some OSRS customs to the game, because I thought it would be a nice addition to the server since I wanted to keep it oldschool and it&#39;s part of oldschool currently. So I went to go add the customs to the ItemDef.java and the ItemDef2.java (one at a time of course) trying different things, because when I add the custom to the client and try to spawn it, it gives me this weird object and I can&#39;t even wield it. I was told by many people to just use a program called, &quot;AllIn1Zipper,&quot; and that didn&#39;t help. So I was also told to update the Model.java, but I wasn&#39;t for sure how to do that. I seen a couple things on Google about it, but nothing really helping me to the fullest. If that is the case that I need to update it if someone could give me a proper link on how do it, I believe I can take it over from there.

Whatever help you guys could give that would be amazing. I just really don&#39;t want to stop this project I&#39;m working on since I&#39;ve been working on it for a while now.

<p>Generally, there are two ways the models are loaded. Either: (A) They are packed into the cache through a few different methods, or (B) They are “preloaded” by placing the files into the Raw folder, meaning these models are handled on the client start-up. You might want to check up on a few things, firstly, make sure that the preloadModels method is actually being called on the startup of the client. Secondly, make sure the files you have gotten are in the correct format, I’m pretty sure you’re supposed to load the models as DAT files, but this may be wrong, it could load archives. If all of this fails, the issue lies in the method460 method of the Model class, but I’d need further information to be able to solve that for you.</p>

<p>Would you be able to check it all over with me on Skype? It would be really helpful. I’m <em><span class="bbcode-u">not the best</span></em> coder when it comes to Customs Models, Customs NPCs, or anything with adding new Maps and such. It would be really nice if you weren’t too busy.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Lol, just realized what I typed. I mean not the best, I’m horrible at it.</p>
