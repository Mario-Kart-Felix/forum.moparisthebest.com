    <description>Attorney Andrew Cohen analyzes legal issues for CBS Media and CBSNews.com . Michael Garcia won the struggle of his molestation as well as conspiracy trial and sometimes it seemed like it wasn&#39;t perhaps close. But his in-court victories, large and small, which usually piled up almost daily, do not guarantee that he&#39;ll get the war and get away from a catastrophic confidence. Jackson&#39;s dilemma is that jurors can believe with unearthly certainty what witnesses established about the supposed victim&#39;s lack of believability and accuracy as well as reliability-and still convict Jackson of your serious crime. Powerful proof of the family&#39;s creepiness as well as predatory behavior does not necessary disprove evidence of Jackson&#39;s bad behavior. Sometimes, shady people are victims, too. And often, guilty defendants are already the targets of their witnesses. This seedy scenario has always been all about inconsistent patterns. Prosecutors argue that the true secret pattern in this case is actually Jackson&#39;s seduction of young boys and the manner in which he had his henchman try to cover it up. Defense attorneys argue that the vital design here is the accusing family&#39;s manipulation and extortion regarding celebrities, especially the specifically vulnerable and na?ve Jackson. If the problem for jurors were basically &quot;is Jackson predator or prey?&quot; the job for that panel later this week may be easier than it is in any other case likely to be. At least because scenario the choice is obvious and unambiguous. But imagine if the jury can be inclined to believe that will Jackson is the two predator and prey? If that&#39;s where the panel boils down during deliberations the Full of Pop have been around in big trouble. This isn&#39;t a contest between a good alleged victim and a defendant over that&#39;s more culpable. There is absolutely no comparative guilt in a criminal case. The particular young man and his family members are not the ones on trial. And a &quot;tie&quot; more than wrongdoing has to go to the criminal prosecution, despite the burdens involving proof and the supposition of innocence. Probably none of this bodes well for the defense.    no previous web page next    1/2  [url=http://www.shinglespringsdreamhomes.com/guccihandbags.html]gucci handbags on sale[/url] 
Five city subway riders and a civil rights group sued the town Thursday to stop arbitrary police inspections of bags in subways, calling the particular searches ineffective, unconstitutional along with a publicity stunt it doesn&#39;t enhance safety.&quot;It&#39;s a new needle-in-the-haystack approach to law enforcement,&quot; said Donna Lieberman, management director of the Ny Civil Liberties Union, which filed your lawsuit in Ough.S. District The courtroom in Manhattan.The girl and other members of the gang who spoke at a news conference to be able to announce the legal action said they want law enforcement to stop terrorists and increase safety, but not using useless measures designed to give subway bikers a false sense of security.Christopher Dunn, the New York Civil Liberties Union&#39;s affiliate legal director, explained the policy announced Come july 1st 21 was akin to a random search of people&#39;s hand bags and packages on public streets along with a violation of a basic civil right.Yet Gail Donoghue, a city lawyer, mentioned the subway searches meet all legal requirements and preserve &quot;the essential balance between guarding our city and also preserving individual privileges.&quot;She added, &quot;We believe your NYCLU is shortsighted in unable to recognize this.

This is my 19th convention, and I really like them. To me, conventions are part of our long democratic tradition, part of what makes America what is. However when I got to Celtics a month ago and noticed businesses being forced to shut, highways and prepare lines being shut down, and millions of taxes dollars being put in, all in the name of making the city safe, I wondered loudly, if hosting the actual Democratic Convention is 1st prize, what do you will get for second? Along with the answer, at least to most New Yorkers, seems to be internet hosting the Republican Convention.Since unbelievable as it appears, a CBS News-New York Times poll carried out last week showed most New Yorkers, 52 per cent, believe the convention should have been kept somewhere else.  And who can fault them? New York is being locked down tight than Boston has been. The thought of terrorist assaults hangs over every thing. And a quarter of an million demonstrators, who have visit protest who knows what, want to tramp all over the brand new grass in Central Park, which the metropolis just re-sodded at the cost regarding $18 million. I suppose conventions really lost their own reason for being as soon as the parties began deciding on candidates beforehand inside the primaries. But they&#39;ve hung on because of tradition and also the enormous pressure coming from big metropolitan authorities, which wanted the amount of money and the publicity that will conventions brought in. However knowing what they now entail, you have to wonder if any city can welcome these gatherings four years from now. I never thought I&#39;d express it, but these conventions may be becoming more trouble as compared to they&#39;re worth.Through Bob Schieffer  [url=http://www.prevoir-labelvie.com/guccioutlet.html]2013 Gucci Outlet Online For Sale,Buy Gucci Outlet Enjoy 50% OFF[/url]
