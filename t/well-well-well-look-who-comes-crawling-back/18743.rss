You win this round mopar :P

Yes, tis true. I feel almost embarrased about coming back, after insisting 100 times that there was no way I was going to come back. I guess I made a fool out of myself, because I wish to come back now.

I lasted nearly 3 months, I guess that&#39;s not too bad. But I was so sick of coming onto forums, the idea never even crossed my mind until recently when James convinced me to come into the irc room. Well, it was nice seeing old faces and I started looking on the forums to see what was new. Then I found myself in various positions where I would have liked to make a comment on something. Not to mention that my friend,(known as coatbridge) started posting on here. She&#39;s not exactly a friend, just someone I know from school, and when we were working on our photography project various times at her place or mine, she&#39;d be online posting and it reminded me how much I used to like it here.

I took a quick look around, looks like most of the people I used to look up to are still here and active, such as PaulT. I have a funny feeling he doesn&#39;t like me, but I think he&#39;s cool because he could make any thread turn funny or prove a point easily. 

On a second note, wow! When I left there was like 5k members, now all of sudden there is 30k. Im sure most of them are first-time posters but hopefully it also means there are some new friendly members here. 

As for whats been happening to me lately, not a whole lot. Realised that my gf was a total bitch so I dumped her, and I&#39;m not looking forward to going to Britain next semester anymore, I might just stay home but the money was great to have. Unfortunatly all I was allowed to do with my money was to put 1000 into my bank and use the rest for college. I don&#39;t see why my parents should be allowed to choose how my money is used, but whatever. 

So, um? Hi :)</description>

<p>Yet, smacker wont let anyone find out. He wont let me post on the forums, because he’s probably gona try to scam them to get some of the money he lost. I’ll make sure he doesn’t, but he temp closed the forums since I kept telling people what happened.</p>

<p>No, I’m not. I smoke weed like once every few weeks, but I like drinking a lot more. Every weekend there are wild parties now, and I usually just drink. Still only in Grade 11. But, our town has a lot of drugs circulating around, downtown is full of crack addicts and all those unpleasent things.</p>

<p>Yes, tis true. I feel almost embarrased about coming back, after insisting 100 times that there was no way I was going to come back. I guess I made a fool out of myself, because I wish to come back now.</p>
<p>I lasted nearly 3 months, I guess that’s not too bad. But I was so sick of coming onto forums, the idea never even crossed my mind until recently when James convinced me to come into the irc room. Well, it was nice seeing old faces and I started looking on the forums to see what was new. Then I found myself in various positions where I would have liked to make a comment on something. Not to mention that my friend,(known as coatbridge) started posting on here. She’s not exactly a friend, just someone I know from school, and when we were working on our photography project various times at her place or mine, she’d be online posting and it reminded me how much I used to like it here.</p>
<p>I took a quick look around, looks like most of the people I used to look up to are still here and active, such as PaulT. I have a funny feeling he doesn’t like me, but I think he’s cool because he could make any thread turn funny or prove a point easily.</p>
<p>On a second note, wow! When I left there was like 5k members, now all of sudden there is 30k. Im sure most of them are first-time posters but hopefully it also means there are some new friendly members here.</p>
<p>As for whats been happening to me lately, not a whole lot. Realised that my gf was a total bitch so I dumped her, and I’m not looking forward to going to Britain next semester anymore, I might just stay home but the money was great to have. Unfortunatly all I was allowed to do with my money was to put 1000 into my bank and use the rest for college. I don’t see why my parents should be allowed to choose how my money is used, but whatever.</p>
<p>So, um? Hi :)[/quote]</p>
<p>Jamie you have the most pathetic will power I have ever witnessed.</p>
<p>But then again who’s complaining <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
