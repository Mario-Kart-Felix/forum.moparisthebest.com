        <p>Really sick of having to say the same stuff over and over again and then hearing the same replies, so here we go, one more time:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nobody is saying the topic broke any written rules, or that any of the written rules were ‘stretched’ to justify locking the topic</li>
<li>It is down to personal opinion on whether or not you find pornography acceptable</li>
<li>Yes this is the internet, but that doesn’t mean every subject is acceptable in every part of the internet. It’s been said before: this isn’t 4chan</li>
<li>The only person fit to decide what subjects are inappropriate for the forum is Moparisthebest himself, not any of you or me.</li>
<li>You have a thread to replace the locked one with just a title change (‘why didnt you just change the title then’? - because I could think of no real title that would be acceptable) so that it doesn’t imply suggestive content, so I’m not sure why you people are crying. By changing the title we change the subject on which the thread revolves. It’s a topic about names, sheesh.</li>
<li>If some sort of moderation happens based on something that is not a written rule, it is unlikely for any punishments to be given, with the exception being extreme cases.</li>
</ol>
<p>[quote=“Loveandpower, post:19, topic:465053”]Going to answer each paragraph</p>
<p>[quote author=Davidi2 link=topic=569490.msg4130630#msg4130630 date=1351028819]<br>
About the NSFW content rule - NSFW is different than hardcore porn. I added the clause myself after to talking to Taharok when we were infracting people for posting images that contained NSFW content either for comical value or to actually contribute in a thread.[/quote]</p>
<p>Give an example of what would be allowed please[/quote]Here’s my advice - keep pornography out of the forum if you want to be 100% safe.</p>
<p>And no, Taharok is not the owner, or ‘semi-owner’ of the forum, unless something happened without MITB telling us. He could make a decision, yes, but that’s just him projecting his opinion on the subject as well (which is exactly what we are doing), and MITB could overrule that as well.</p>
<p>[quote=“Bowser jr, post:20, topic:465053”]Love:</p>
<p>Read the rules of this forum. Davidi2 is in his right to block that thread. Objectifying women isn’t leading to a positive community.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Rule 1:</span><br>
Moderators lock topics/remove posts and topics/hand infractions to users at their own discretion as required to foster a <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">positive community</span></span>. Any disagreement with a staff member’s decision is to be resolved through the use of the PM system. Any public disputes are unacceptable and punishable. A moderators decision is final, if you have a problem with it, pm an administrator. Trying to resolve it through a thread will result in a heavier punishment.[/quote]This too. I wont be handing out any punishments, but I think the subject can be dropped. It’s not even a common case, it’s a locked topic that has a replacement, and it’s no big deal. It turned into one because some porn advocates seem to think they need a place to discuss pornography on a RSPS forum with an average age of 13 :rolleyes:</p>
<p>Locked. Any more questions can be directed to my private message box, as I’m sure Zyle doesn’t want to deal with all the tears.</p>
