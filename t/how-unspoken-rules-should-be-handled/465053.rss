              <p>Really sick of having to say the same stuff over and over again and then hearing the same replies, so here we go, one more time:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nobody is saying the topic broke any written rules, or that any of the written rules were ‘stretched’ to justify locking the topic</li>
<li>It is down to personal opinion on whether or not you find pornography acceptable</li>
<li>Yes this is the internet, but that doesn’t mean every subject is acceptable in every part of the internet. It’s been said before: this isn’t 4chan</li>
<li>The only person fit to decide what subjects are inappropriate for the forum is Moparisthebest himself, not any of you or me.</li>
<li>You have a thread to replace the locked one with just a title change (‘why didnt you just change the title then’? - because I could think of no real title that would be acceptable) so that it doesn’t imply suggestive content, so I’m not sure why you people are crying. By changing the title we change the subject on which the thread revolves. It’s a topic about names, sheesh.</li>
<li>If some sort of moderation happens based on something that is not a written rule, it is unlikely for any punishments to be given, with the exception being extreme cases.</li>
</ol>
<p>[quote=“Loveandpower, post:19, topic:465053”]Going to answer each paragraph</p>
<p>[quote author=Davidi2 link=topic=569490.msg4130630#msg4130630 date=1351028819]<br>
About the NSFW content rule - NSFW is different than hardcore porn. I added the clause myself after to talking to Taharok when we were infracting people for posting images that contained NSFW content either for comical value or to actually contribute in a thread.[/quote]</p>
<p>Give an example of what would be allowed please[/quote]Here’s my advice - keep pornography out of the forum if you want to be 100% safe.</p>
<p>And no, Taharok is not the owner, or ‘semi-owner’ of the forum, unless something happened without MITB telling us. He could make a decision, yes, but that’s just him projecting his opinion on the subject as well (which is exactly what we are doing), and MITB could overrule that as well.</p>
<p>[quote=“Bowser jr, post:20, topic:465053”]Love:</p>
<p>Read the rules of this forum. Davidi2 is in his right to block that thread. Objectifying women isn’t leading to a positive community.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Rule 1:</span><br>
Moderators lock topics/remove posts and topics/hand infractions to users at their own discretion as required to foster a <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">positive community</span></span>. Any disagreement with a staff member’s decision is to be resolved through the use of the PM system. Any public disputes are unacceptable and punishable. A moderators decision is final, if you have a problem with it, pm an administrator. Trying to resolve it through a thread will result in a heavier punishment.[/quote]This too. I wont be handing out any punishments, but I think the subject can be dropped. It’s not even a common case, it’s a locked topic that has a replacement, and it’s no big deal. It turned into one because some porn advocates seem to think they need a place to discuss pornography on a RSPS forum with an average age of 13 :rolleyes:</p>
<p>Locked. Any more questions can be directed to my private message box, as I’m sure Zyle doesn’t want to deal with all the tears.</p>

</aside>
<p>Common sense to one person won’t be common sense to another. That is why rules need to be exact.</p>
<p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:17, topic:465053”]About the topic - as I said in every reply I made, it being locked had nothing to do with it breaking the NSFW content rule, because I don’t think anyone actually believes that it did. The main reason that topic was locked was because of the title and how specific the thread was in regards to a ‘favorite’ type of thread. It’s one of those subjects that’s on the fence in terms of how appropriate it is, for example:<br>
OK - Post your favorite female athlete<br>
Meh - Post your favorite pornstar<br>
Never ok - Post your favorite CP[/quote]</p>
<p>change the title then nooblet</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because it’s like this, everyone will have their own opinion on whether or not they think it should be allowed. For example, Bowser isn’t a moderator and thinks it shouldn’t have been allowed, and we got a few reports of the thread as well from people that found it inappropriate/offensive. Some may say ‘well if they dont like it they dont have to open the thread’, but in this case the title itself may be offensive, and there’s no way to reword it while still keeping the specific content alignment of ‘favorites’ that thread had.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>as a former moderator for a large gaming forum and for the rs forum, people are going to make reports of stuff NO MATTER WHAT. There is no way to define what is culturally/morally acceptable 100% to everyone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a compromise, the post your favorite woman thread is open to all types of ‘favorites’.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>if anything makes a topic  too “general” nobody is going to know everyone posted</p>
<p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:17, topic:465053”]And don’t expect there to be a rule written about this either, it’d be virtually impossible to create one that covers everything Moparisthebest interprets as inappropriate or not. Because remember - it’s not if you guys think it’s ok, it’s what Moparisthebest thinks. Anyone remember the whole RS account recovery thing? Yea…</p>
<p>So again, use common sense. In cases like this, it’s not like people are getting infractions either, so there’s no point to complain about it. If you want to discuss something MITB deems inappropriate, do it somewhere else or in private message. For now, we’re just trying to interpret what MITB wants without him actually being here, we may be incorrect, but we can’t know for sure unless he looks at it himself.[/quote]</p>
<p>Correct me if I am wrong but MITB gave Taharok pretty much ownership status type of deal for Mopar. Taharok could easily make a decision on this. Where is he now? Why hasn’t he made a ruling? From what I have seen honestly between you, zyle, and elve mage there is a disagreement here. This should be took to whatever type of moderator center you guys have and let an administrator take action.</p>

[/quote]Pretty sure that’s correct. As long as its denoted NSFW (and preferably mentioned that it is in fact pornographic material) and the actual picture/video itself isn’t posted, its fine.[/quote]but does that mean by directly linking you can’t embed a video? you can’t link to a video? you can’t post pictures from a gallery? etc it isn’t very specific. What does it consider an indirect showing of pornography.</p>
