    <title>What do you dislike about RuneScape? Why did you join this site?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-do-you-dislike-about-runescape-why-did-you-join-this-site/460701</link>
    <description>This is a simple poll (which may be moved elsewhere on the forums over time). Basically, I&#39;m curious about what regarding RuneScape drove you to joining MoparScape and possibly cheating and/or being involved with private servers. What about the old game and current game do you dislike and wish was different?

I&#39;ll begin listing them below as they come in. :)</description>

              <p>I was lured and lost all I had. I wanted to have good stuff with little effort (I lost like 3m worth of stuff, around 2006). Discovered the site, then later the silab client. I enjoyed the variety of the servers at the time, when people would just add random shit because they could. Every is trying to remake the game, but did it even occur to anyone that we’re here because we didn’t want to play the game?</p>
<p>The first server I discovered was a Dodian, and even now it’s still my favorite. Both the servers and the game have come a long way. Jagex has gave up what they stood for when membership went from $5 to $6 a month. The servers offered originality. It seems like both are slowly driving themselves into the ground.</p>

<p>Minus the first part, the last part is the same for me as well, it began with playing RuneScape all the time, then I found out about private servers from a friend in grade school, from there I started programming, and now here I am.</p>

              <p>I played rsps’s for years after ive quit runescape in late 08.<br>
I joined the rsps scene because i always wanted to make my own server.<br>
I started on rl actually but fast i started to get addicted to java and went to mscp due it being more professional,<br>
and a clean decent website also, that rl shit is euh… shit lol.<br>
I dislike about runescape that it’s getting more and more controlled by money, and it just isn’t rs anymore. It looks<br>
like a fantasy game now, where sociality is far gone.<br>
I liked the good old medieval game where everyone had fun with each other, there’s nothing left of that.</p>

I was google’ing about runescape (for ways to cheat of course), and came across this one spawn server, and I fell in love, eager to figure out what these things were, I googled everything. I then came across “<a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a>” and I tried using that client, and found a server on the list of servers and started playing it.

              <p>About the current game:</p>
<p>What I dislike right now is the community. I don’t dislike the new content, and while I do miss the old days for nostalgic reasons, I don’t try to blame jagex for changing the game and saying they are making it worse. Like I’ve said quite a few times and I still stand by it – I think people that say the game was so much better in 07 or whatever do so because of nostalgia, not because the new updates are bad. They try to say Jagex is ruining the game, but the majority of updates are actually pretty good.</p>
<p>So yea, the community is pretty shit. I think a lot of it has to do with botting. It seems like most of the achievements in the game are worthless, whereas back in the day they meant something. I think it’s too late to fix this, even removing the bots now wont make a difference in the community for probably at least 5 years. The game turned from ‘have fun with other players’ to ‘try and compete with the bots’. Probably one of the more clear examples is house parties. They used to be about hanging out with people and having fun, but now they are all just for prayer training.</p>

Read the OP, there are multiple questions.</p>
<p>VVVVV</p>
<p>[quote=“Taharok, post:1, topic:460701”]This is a simple poll (which may be moved elsewhere on the forums over time). Basically, I’m curious about what regarding RuneScape drove you to joining MoparScape and possibly cheating and/or being involved with private servers. What about the old game and current game do you dislike and wish was different?</p>
<p>I’ll begin listing them below as they come in. :)[/quote]</p>

              <p>Early 08, a mate on RS told me about these Private Servers so I decided to check one out (Silabs client/Allstar). I actually really enjoyed it and played it until the owner took it down.</p>
<p>Back when I found out, there was nothing I really hated about RS, had only been playing 2years MAX and I was mainly housing EVERY time I logged in which I did since the start of the skill.  I still remember it being fun but maybe at the time It got really repetitive for me.</p>
<p>Very late 08, I finally decided to sign up because I was really intrigued to make my own server, even if it was a little shitty one, just wanted to try something new. At the time, nothing drove me here.</p>
<p>I quit sometime in early 2011. Everything was changing, mates were quitting and had pretty much done most things in game at least once. Houses weren’t the same no longer, quitting mates and money were the main reasons why I left.</p>
<p>Now I look at the game, I dislike everything they have done to the game. The game has changed so much now. Now is the time that RS would drive me to Moparscape.</p>

              <p>I ACTUALLY remember coming, I was on RuneScape killing some zombies using range. Friend was with me and told me about the “MoparScape” client and called it some-sort of hack, and told me that I could have all 99s if I wanted, and could ‘spawn’ items. I was VERY interested, and young. I came to the link he showed me, logged in (thought the music was awesome), and went online for a bit, I was astonished.</p>
<p>Then I went back to him and told him how amazing it was, I stopped using the client because I didn’t see ANY other members and thought it was like glitched or something at the time, finally I went back after a couple of months and then saw a link above and saw a “status page”, I went there and saw the first server at the time, and it was called “BlackScape”. I played it and saw others so I remained there, and had a lot of fun.</p>
<p>I don’t think I ever registered until 2005-06. And then ever since, I was on-off on MSCP, but quit RuneScape a little bit and what not.</p>

<p>WoW’s microT mounts look worse than the mounts that are hard to get by challenges in the game itself, but they look better than the low level mounts.</p>
<p>Look at how huge and glowy all the weapons on solomons are. Its like they want players to say “wow whered you get that.” Its almost like they were told to make them as big and shiny as possible. Some people will say “so what it doesn’t effect you its just vanity stuff” it still ruins the rpg community feeling. “Hey whered you get that?” “Reward for minigame, im going there soon you wanna go?” “Sure!”</p>
<p>Now its just</p>
<p>“Wow whered you get that”<br>
“Solomons”<br>
“Meh”</p>
<p>Not only that but the animations on solomons and stuff have turned the game into a joke. I wish they atleast disabled solomons items/anims in members worlds.</p>
