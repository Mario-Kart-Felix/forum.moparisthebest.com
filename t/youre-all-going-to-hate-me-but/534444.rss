    <description>First of all, sorry.
I am truly sorry.

I couldn&#39;t find the answer to my stupid question. I only just downloaded Mopar 3.2 after being banned on RuneScape which, in turn, pissed me right off. I started playing a private server and thought it was pretty cool, however I&#39;d like my own.
Aaaanyways...
I&#39;ve got Moparscape 3.2, it&#39;s running but I can&#39;t login. Here&#39;s the process;
Open runmoparscape.bat
Console comes up. Quickly switch to Mopar to disable the music lol.
In the console it says; 
[code]
WARNING: Could not open/create prefs root node Software\JavaSoft\prefs at root 0x80000002. Windows RegCreateKeyEx&lt;...&gt; returned error code 5.[/code]
Back to Mopar, I click Enter, attempt to log on. Error connecting to server, must be down, blah blah blah. Click start server, says it&#39;s all good, retry log on. Connecting to server... Your account is already logged on. Try again right now, or make another username.
I attempt both and it doesn&#39;t work.
[code][01:44:24] Logging into (mistikman, *****)
[01:44:24] Your UID is: 49048299
Server: ClientHandler: Accepted from x.x.x.x:x
Did not save for mistikman
Server: ClientHandler: Client mistikman disconnected.
[01:44:27] Couldn&#39;t open output stream to log file mistikman-20131021.log
[01:44:27] [/code]

Somebody please tell me what to do. :(
All I want to do is log on. be able to play offline and edit/create my server to eventually share it around.

Once again, I&#39;m sorry, I searched through threads for hours, perhaps not hard enough but I couldn&#39;t find anything.</description>

              <p>Well the answer is most likely there, just that the thread would be about 6 years old by now. By using moparscape you are stuck with the given(shit) server and can only play solo. From the error given i would have to assume you have a firewall or something blocking file creation on your computer. For a better server/client source go to the “server downloads” section.</p>
<p>I gave up on rs because of EoC.</p>
