    <title>[508] Making a door open with a certain item</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-making-a-door-open-with-a-certain-item/321123</link>
    <description>Hello, to start off, I am using a bulby source. I was wondering if it is possible to make it so that a door on my 508 server will only open, if a player has a certain item like a key of some sort. Could anybody please post a link to a tutorial, or just at the ery least direct me in the direction of which file(s) I need to edit? 

Thanks,
Cheeba</description>
