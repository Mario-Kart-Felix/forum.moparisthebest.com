    <title>Possible thread issue with Components in Swing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/possible-thread-issue-with-components-in-swing/429228</link>
    <description>I&#39;m making a Plugin application that has a Swing UI, and the changes that are called by the plugins (loaded from a jar dynamically) are/n&#39;t taking effect.

Right now I have a TestPlugin that adds a JMenu to the Application&#39;s JMenuBar. It doesn&#39;t always work. Sometimes it will add, and sometimes it won&#39;t. However, after loading the plugins, calling [i]menubar.getMenuCount()[/i] will always return the right number.

I have 4 menus which are part of the DefaultMenuBar (File, Edit, View, Help) which always get rendered. After calling [i]menubar.getMenuCount()[/i], it returns 5, even if only the 4 are visible.

Does anyone know what would cause this? I&#39;ve tried calling [i]testMenu.setVisible(true);[/i] both before and after it&#39;s been added to the menubar, but nothing happens.</description>

              <p>It definitely sounds like a concurrency problem. Are you handling the concurrency correctly? As object suggested, you need to use SwingUtilities.invokeLater(Runnable) in order to safely mutate swing objects. Read this:</p>

<p>Swing is not thread-safe. You have to use proper synchronization techniques or you will run into weird problems, like the ones you’re having.</p>

              <p>Try calling the “revalidate()” method. Also, you might want to try it using “SwingUtilities.invokeLater(Runnable)”. That will run the code inside the AWT event dispatching Thread.</p>
