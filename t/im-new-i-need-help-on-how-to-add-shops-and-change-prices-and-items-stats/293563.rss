    <title>Im new i need help on how to add shops and change prices and items stats</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-new-i-need-help-on-how-to-add-shops-and-change-prices-and-items-stats/293563</link>
    <description>Im new to the whole runescape private server thing and i just needed someone to tell me:
-How to add shops
-How to change the prices of the items in the shops
-How to change items from null to their actual item
-How to change weapon stats
-How to add teleports to the emote tab
-And how to add a general store so u can sell anything to it for reduced price

There are much more things i need to learn and want to learn
And its ok im not like those peoplewho you have to tell them what to do over and over
im a fast learner.

If someone could tell me how to do these things or post a video link i can watch that would be awesome :)

PS: I&#39;ve tried watching tutorials on moparscape and it says i am not allowed to view them or they&#39;re not available to me
if anyone knows why could you tell me that also?

Thanks

<p>He told you the file to put them in, you can EASILY read the files, and find out what to do by simply looking at the other formats.</p>
