    <description>ok i have my own server that im working on, but every once in a while when i try to log in it will log me in but the only thing i see is a blackscreen with &quot;loading please wait&quot; in the middle. All of the menus and such work but i cant see anything. Ive asked my friends...who sometimes play on the server...and they have said it happens to them too. Is there a way to fix this or is it just lagg</description>
