Can be completed but... 

[ul][*]If you run from the tree spirit, he wont chase you, but you still need to defeat him to advance.
[*]Entrana monks doesn&#39;t search you for weapon or armor. :(
[*]Monks before the dramen dungeon doesn&#39;t  warn you unless you talk to them.
[*]Quest will be finished when you equip the staff the first time, it will also teleport you Zanaris entrance.[/ul]


Npcs id to spawn, adventures = 206, 207, 208, 209  (to start quest!)

Remember this is a plug-in so i didn&#39;t wanted you edit other class files, so you just trow in the file on quest folder and your ready to go.

To fix the ship monks go to plugins/npc folder and edit EntranaMonks.java to not let you go in with weapons and armors.

To replicate the use of the shed&#39;s door to Zanaris, first you need to delete the ObjectTelePoint entry, on Server/conf/server/extras/locs folder
[code]	&lt;entry&gt;
		&lt;Point&gt;
			&lt;x&gt;126&lt;/x&gt;
			&lt;y&gt;686&lt;/y&gt;
		&lt;/Point&gt;
		&lt;TelePoint&gt;
			&lt;command&gt;Open&lt;/command&gt;
			&lt;x&gt;126&lt;/x&gt;
			&lt;y&gt;3518&lt;/y&gt;
		&lt;/TelePoint&gt;
	&lt;/entry&gt;[/code]

Then edit WallObjectAction.java and add a a &quot;case 66:&quot; with the code to teleport you while wielding the staff...  :rolleyes:

<p>I already tried on various ways to detect the door and couldn’t make it work, there is also a ObjectTelePoint already there (yep could get to zanaris without anything). Also already posted that WallObjectAction.java needs to be edit or at least i think it should.</p>
<p>I works pretty good like it is now and i missed some text from from the npcs like Arsonist said, so i will not try to replicate to 100%… what you see is what you get (if you want it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> ).</p>
<p>Alright i think i will move onto Fight arena now or Plague city series.</p>

<p>I really tried my best to do it the way it should, but the compile errors and and weird bugs really annoyed me. But without knowing java, the only thing i can do is look at the code already in the source and adjust it in someway to work like i want.</p>

<p>In fact i like that the staff gives an instant teleport, also like i said it is a plugin and i wanted that anyone could use it without changing other files in case they didn’t knowing how to code (like myself  :P).</p>

<p>Since I’ve been coding in quests myself, I’d just like to point out something I noticed: you haven’t actually coded all the chat options. For example, in line 45 you automatically assumed the player selected “What are you camped here for?”, rather than include the other option which was “Do you know any good aventures I can go on?” and you never included the chat options “Who’s Zanaris?”, “what’s Zanaris?”, “What makes you think it’s out here”, you automatically make the player ask “Who’s Zanaris?”…I wouldn’t be happy unless the quests gave the player every option like in the original RSC, though this might not be a big issue to others, I dunno <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Another thing, I was hoping it was possible, rather than writing 2 lines every NPC chat line like this:</p>
<p>owner.informOfNpcMessage(new ChatMessage(n, “their message goes here”, owner));<br>
sleep(2000);</p>
<p>To simply write a function which can be called like so:</p>
<p>NpcTalk(“their message goes here”);<br>
NpcTalk(“next message, 2000 miliseconds later”);</p>
<p>And also if you want to give the player a message, you could use the function:</p>
<p>SendMessage(“You don’t have enough coins!”);</p>
<p>and since, rarely but it happens, messages are sent instantaneously, you would just have to change the default sleep time like so:</p>
<p>SendMessage(“You attempt you pay the Farmer…”, 0);<br>
SendMessage(“You don’t have enough coins!”);</p>
<p>So essentially when you’re writing the SendMessage function, you’d do something like this… SendMessage(str str, int int=2000); {   &lt;- I don’t really know how to code Java well, though I’m going to learn when I need to for progressing in RSC replication, but I think you know what I mean…Setting the default wait time as 2000 so we don’t always need to write it until there’s a instantaneous message. Same goes for the NpcTalk("",0); and PlayerTalk("",0); functions, if the second variable isn’t there it automatically sleeps for 2000 miliseconds.</p>
<p>This is how I’ve written 98 NPC chat logs including somewhere between 10-30 quests <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> if this isn’t possible, all is not lost, I’ll just write an Auto Hot Key script which will convert the text calling the NpcTalk(""); function and rewrite it in the owner.informOfNpcMessage(new ChatMessage(n, “”, owner)); format.</p>

[</em>]Entrana monks doesn’t search you for weapon or armor. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
[<em>]Monks before the dramen dungeon doesn’t  warn you unless you talk to them.<br>
[</em>]Quest will be finished when you equip the staff the first time, it will also teleport you Zanaris entrance.[/ul]</p>
<p>Npcs id to spawn, adventures = 206, 207, 208, 209  (to start quest!)</p>
<p>Remember this is a plug-in so i didn’t wanted you edit other class files, so you just trow in the file on quest folder and your ready to go.</p>
<p>To fix the ship monks go to plugins/npc folder and edit EntranaMonks.java to not let you go in with weapons and armors.</p>
<p>To replicate the use of the shed’s door to Zanaris, first you need to delete the ObjectTelePoint entry, on Server/conf/server/extras/locs folder</p>
<p><code>	&lt;entry&gt;
		&lt;Point&gt;
			&lt;x&gt;126&lt;/x&gt;
			&lt;y&gt;686&lt;/y&gt;
		&lt;/Point&gt;
		&lt;TelePoint&gt;
			&lt;command&gt;Open&lt;/command&gt;
			&lt;x&gt;126&lt;/x&gt;
			&lt;y&gt;3518&lt;/y&gt;
		&lt;/TelePoint&gt;
	&lt;/entry&gt;</code></p>
<p>Then edit WallObjectAction.java and add a a “case 66:” with the code to teleport you while wielding the staff…  :rolleyes:</p>
