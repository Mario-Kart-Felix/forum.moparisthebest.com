    <title>Discussion of world 2 expanding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/discussion-of-world-2-expanding/421509</link>
    <description>Im just saying it would be better if it was 1000 or so bigger Because started to build a castle then realise that the end of the world is like 20 blocks away from my castle
and most town are close

like Pine Town i made a farm there about 10 away is end of world
Found a under ground mine take a couple of steps end of world

Please at least think about making world 2 bigger</description>
