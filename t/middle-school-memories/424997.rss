    <description>What is the clearest memory that you have middle school? Anything that you did or who you hung out with? For me, middle school was when I actually experimented with music. I think the bands that I loved were &quot;Panic at the Disco&quot;, &quot;MCR (My Chemical Romance&quot;, &quot;Breaking Benjamen&quot;, and &quot;Default&quot; and the combination of these bands I think is what made my taste in music today. I love everything except country :p. So pretty much what do you remember or miss when you were in middle school?</description>

              <p>Oh how I hated middle school so. Seventh grade year was the better one tbh. Mrs. Besch (pronounced BITCH lol not really(English, LA teacher) was the WORST teacher in school. No one liked her. She was old, cranky, and loved to give homework assignments no one could finish. Then there was Ms. Sedalnik (took me a while to figure out how to pronounce that one). Well She was alright, but one day my class made her cry (making fun of her Jew heritage. wasn’t me lol) and the irritating SRO (School resource officer) had to come in and watch the class. I couldn’t stand him. He hated me and my two brothers (they caused the hatred during their middle school years). What else… Mrs. Takata was the coolest Middle school teacher ever. She had a pet Chinchilla. I got to take it home over the summer and shit. She was such a relaxed and hardcore teacher. Those are most of my memories of seventh grade year.</p>
<p>On to eighth. Basketball was my thing, me and George (Spanish.) were the best. If we got put on a team together we never lost a game. I was great at sports, then I grew. Now I can’t play them worth shit. Oh I got in 3 fights that year, 2 of which got me a ticket and suspension. One of em I hit a teacher too lol.</p>
<p>Anything else???.. No I think that covers it for the most part.<br>
Wait, 7-8th grade year is when I found my love for computers <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

[/quote]I knew exactly what you were referring to, your picture was just spam as a) cooks don’t even make the food anymore (they just heat it or whatever), and b) it wasn’t your school cook?

<p>@ a) not exactly true, (when I was in school) lol they did do some cooking</p>
