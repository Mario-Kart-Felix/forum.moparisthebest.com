    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/aggroth-2k6-remake-client-help-needed/469607</link>
    <description>Hello mopar, this is a simple topic,


I am working on a HUGE remake of 2k6 scape

or, runescape in 2006

I got alot atm,
but i am not a client coder, and i was wondering if anyone could program my client into a cachedownloader, 
it works now, but i cant make it into a webclient, 
also, i didnt code anything of it,
i will give you the client, and if its done, let me know, and you will gain acces into this project :

Also, i know how to make website&#39;s so thats not an issue.
