    <title>Changing the transparency picture over the inventory screen? Pictures included</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-the-transparency-picture-over-the-inventory-screen-pictures-included/277728</link>
    <description>Alright, I have been working on this client for a while, but I am not sure how to edit this picture, as I am not that experienced in client work. If you can help with this issue (Picture Placed Below) then please post. What I really need to know, is just the folder or .java document I need to change it in. I have gone through ALL of my pictures in my client, none have anything to do with this. So my guess is, that the picture was placed with a link. Yet, I need to know where the link is.

Any help at ALL is appreciated, please do not flame, as I am newer to the client making.

Thanks,

              <p>Yeah, I searched for 3 hours for it. I ended up finding it on some old retarded search engine, but it wasn’t a topic anymore. It redirected me to the Error 404 page. If you can find another tut it would be appreciated.</p>
