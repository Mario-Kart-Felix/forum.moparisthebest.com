    <title>A hypothetical question on secular thieving skill implement allowances</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-hypothetical-question-on-secular-thieving-skill-implement-allowances/542007</link>
    <description>This may be a stupid question, but I believe I should put this out there.

In managing the thieving skill ability to players, should any number of players simultaneously training thieving on any given market stall be able to synchronize attempts in successful stealing and every player to get goods with all of their synchronized theft?

From my understanding on keeping the possibilities of this particular training option viable with many players training with this method I think initially in Runescape synchronized theft from stalls was possible.  If you think about it on training a lesser stall, the cake stall and silk stall respawn quick enough that several players training on those stalls could share the stall and this secular method could be feasible.  On the flip side, making every player on one stall compete in who&#39;s quick enough to be the one to get the stealing attempt off leaving any other player &quot;in the dust&quot; very well puts stall theft as a very undesired way to train in cases where the market could be full of thieves.  All my logic tells me as far as stall method training in large groups is it works if all players that manage a theft at the same time can all get stolen goods as most desirable.  If the programming causes only the quickest thieving player to hold leeway to a sole instance of theft a server would see sparse to dead content at any stall if the competition amongst thieves was this particular over who is the quickest thief to any stall with exception to who gets over to the stall when it respawns.</description>

To any person that reads this thread, this viewpoint of how I remember a few other skills being shared around the 317 and 377 era have their roots to shared use of a skill.</p>
<p>All the way back to classic people shared resources, I was there, if I had half a brain back then I would have left my main as a level 9 hitpoints miner and show it off these days.  Whoever would be so inclined to not allow shared resources is pretty much blatantly offsetting a flip side of a good '06 remake where there’s at least 1k users on at any given hour.  Preventing shared resources stabs stall stealing in the hands of those that would choose that method to train thieving.  This goes in to even f2p in classic, that’s how we mined, pick a rock and mine it, hoping to get ore out of an unmarked rock that has ore to it, and every so often you get ore with whoever mines with you.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Let me reiterate and expand what I’m saying, since apparently the replies here are assuming that on the server no NPC catches thieves stealing from stalls and with any size player base there will be few and far between anyone that actually decides to train thieving through stall theft with no complaints from the player base.</p>
<p>Here’s the scenario:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Setting is a player attempts to lift goods from a stall[/li]<br>
[li]Guards are in place and programmed to catch theft from stalls[/li]<br>
[li]Stall Merchants are programmed to catch thieves in the act and alert guards to theft[/li]<br>
[li]Each stall is appropriately set to allow players to steal from them with the required level of thieving to pilfer the goods[/li]<br>
[li]Thieving level and stall difficulty determines probability calculations to be caught in the attempts[/li]<br>
[li]Any attempt on the thief’s part in thieving from stalls prevents the player from interaction with merchants present at the stalls for a set time after last theft[/li]<br>
[li]Two or more player thieves are at one given stall or stalls of proximity are training at the stall or stalls[/li]<br>
[li]Every stall is emptied with any player with a successful theft and the resource respawns after a set time again according to level of the stall in question[/li]<br>
[li]Player thieves are predicted to actively synchronize attempts at a stall in question[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Allowance A is as follows:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Programming awards the first thief to get a packet to the server and back to their client with the theft of the goods[/li]<br>
[li]Additional players too slow to send their packets in time are denied of a successful steal[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Allowance B is as follows:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Programming awards multiple players with each having successful attempts with acquisition of the goods[/li]<br>
[li]From the first occurrence of a packet with a successful theft a window of opportunity is open for any other packet received 200ms afterwards[/li]<br>
[li]In the window of opportunity any players getting their packet in before the window closes gets a successful theft and exp[/li]<br>
[li]Any player sending a packet after the window closes fails the theft, no goods, no exp[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>The speculations on Allowance A of my understanding limits unspoken cooperation in more than one player at a stall with simultaneous successful theft based entirely on computer and network speeds.  I think in doing this prevents the content to steal from stalls, in limiting anyone’s abilities at their client based on ideally equal ability of computer specifications and unequal network speeds, from experiencing amusement based on my opinion, programming with this condition.  Personal predictions if a server does it this way makes stealing from stalls something of exclusiveness with any attempts on any level of stall and would limit everyone at one time interested in this content at one place of stalls to stick to one main stall.  Secondary stalls with slow respawn are excluded in this argument due to variable player observation ability to catch them at a respawn.  On Allowance A my speculation is that this could turn off a large player base from even thinking about going stall thieving and could turn in to near dead content.  Who really likes to be stifled on uber strict programming?</p>
<p>As far as Allowance B, more than one player could share any of their successful attempts if everyone stealing from the stall times their thefts at every respawn.  The window of opportunity would account for an amount of players encompassed of a large network range of the server that are sharing a stall.  My speculation says that players could find amusement to use the content on the basis of this allowance since they would be rewarded as long as they’re at the stall already with any other thieving trainers with their actual successful thefts.  More of my prediction states in concerns of economic surplus that valuable goods from such of the slow respawning stalls would not be crowded up with applicable thieves.  Who really waits up to two minutes to catch a respawn of those stalls standing at the stall in question, namely the scimitar, spice, or gem stall?</p>
<p>In a closing, I’m asking for realistic replies in reasoning of game content and realistic speculation on this scenario.  Adding content for completeness that potentially isn’t going to be used from my point of view is wasted programming.  Even twenty more lines of code to provide in Allowance B is worth more provisions than doing it with Allowance A that my sound judgment would predict a lot of overly unsatisfied players in forcing very strict competition to them with amusement of this content.</p>

              <p>I’m not entirely positive that this would be a huge impact on the economy, but it would kill the overall idea. In reality, when someone steals something for a stall, is that stall still available to be stolen from the moment after? No, and although this isn’t reality, some concepts would just be so minuscule that adding them would be a big deal for something that isn’t necessarily a huge problem anymore.</p>

              <p>This may be a stupid question, but I believe I should put this out there.</p>
<p>In managing the thieving skill ability to players, should any number of players simultaneously training thieving on any given market stall be able to synchronize attempts in successful stealing and every player to get goods with all of their synchronized theft?</p>
<p>From my understanding on keeping the possibilities of this particular training option viable with many players training with this method I think initially in Runescape synchronized theft from stalls was possible.  If you think about it on training a lesser stall, the cake stall and silk stall respawn quick enough that several players training on those stalls could share the stall and this secular method could be feasible.  On the flip side, making every player on one stall compete in who’s quick enough to be the one to get the stealing attempt off leaving any other player “in the dust” very well puts stall theft as a very undesired way to train in cases where the market could be full of thieves.  All my logic tells me as far as stall method training in large groups is it works if all players that manage a theft at the same time can all get stolen goods as most desirable.  If the programming causes only the quickest thieving player to hold leeway to a sole instance of theft a server would see sparse to dead content at any stall if the competition amongst thieves was this particular over who is the quickest thief to any stall with exception to who gets over to the stall when it respawns.</p>
