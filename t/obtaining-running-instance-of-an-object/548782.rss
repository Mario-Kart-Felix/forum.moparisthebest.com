    <title>Obtaining running instance of an Object</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/obtaining-running-instance-of-an-object/548782</link>
    <description>Hi all. For a project I&#39;m working on I need to invoke a method in an application (a method I know exists) however, I do not have an instance of the class that is running. Basically, the application is running separately from my application. I can use reflection to create an instance of the object in runtime but that doesn&#39;t accomplish my goal. 
I can&#39;t modify the destination application either (ie, to connect to it via LAN or otherwise).

I&#39;ve considered invoking a static method in a new instance of the object obtained through reflection, however, I don&#39;t know if a static method will be able to modify the values contained within the original (destination) application.

Please give it your best shot. I&#39;m interested in seeing if this is possible.</description>

Another thing you could look into is having a serversocket on the program that has the object, and then connect to it with an object input stream. Note that you’ll have to poll the server multiple times of you need to know about changes to the object. I’ll clean up then explanation when I get to work.<br>
[/quote]He never made it to work…[/quote]</p>
<p>Sorry, hell of a day at work. What you can do is have one program be the server, and the other the client. Here’s a quick example:</p>
<p>[code=Java]package test;</p>
<p>import java.io.IOException;<br>
import java.io.ObjectOutputStream;<br>
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;<br>
import java.net.ServerSocket;<br>
import java.net.Socket;<br>
import java.net.SocketAddress;</p>
<p>public class ServerProgram {</p>
<pre><code>public ServerProgram() throws IOException {
	serverSocket = new ServerSocket();
	final SocketAddress address = new InetSocketAddress(22222);
	serverSocket.bind(address);
}


public static void main(final String[] args) throws IOException {
	final ServerProgram program = new ServerProgram();
	program.start();
}
public void start() throws IOException {
	final boolean running = true;
	final Foo foo = new Foo("Value String");
	while (running) {
		final Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();
		final ObjectOutputStream outputStream = new ObjectOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());
		outputStream.writeObject(foo);
		outputStream.close();
	}
}

private final ServerSocket serverSocket;
</code></pre>
<p>}<br>
[/code]</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">package test;

import java.io.Serializable;

public final class Foo implements Serializable {

	/**
	 * 
	 */
	private static final long serialVersionUID = 5153710730102435520L;

	public Foo(final String value) {
		if (value == null) {
			throw new IllegalArgumentException("value must not be null");
		}
		this.value = value;
	}

	public String getValue() {
		return value;
	}

	private final String value;
}</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">package test;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
import java.net.Socket;
import java.net.SocketAddress;
import java.net.UnknownHostException;

public class ClientProgram {

	public static void main(final String[] args) throws UnknownHostException, IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
		final Socket socket = new Socket();
		final SocketAddress address = new InetSocketAddress("127.0.0.1", 22222);
		socket.connect(address);
		final ObjectInputStream input = new ObjectInputStream(socket.getInputStream());
		final Foo foo = (Foo) input.readObject();
		input.close();
		socket.close();
		System.out.println(foo.getValue());
	}
}</code></pre>
<p>This is a very basic example, but I think it illustrates the point. There are certainly better ways to do this. This will also (I believe) send any referenced objects. But I’m not sure. Also, if your <span class="bbcode-i">Foo</span> class has any references to a non-serializable object, it will fail to deserialize it. Also, you will need to continuously poll the server for the most up to date information. If you want literally, up to the second changes, you could use RMI like silab said. It just depends on what exactly you want.</p>

</aside>
<p>That is the most common approach, you can update the object as needed through the stream if you use one.</p>
