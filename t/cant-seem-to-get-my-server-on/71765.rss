              <p>what is your router? because i used to have the same problem. it has to do with your anti virus. (if this is the case) because for me when i ran my first server, norton anti virus, blocked people from entering my server. it blocked out port 2224 Tcp connection. so noone could log in. if this is the case, you would just go to NAv and click on options, click on the sub-catergory, internet worm protection and uncheck the box and put for “until system restarts” and that should fix your problem, if thats the case. if it isn’t and you have another anti virus just boot up your computer wthout the anti virus running by using Start&gt;Run&gt;type in “msconfig” without quotations. if you could specify the router i could help you out more…sorry.</p>

              <p>yes hes right port forward but scince u can log into ur server off of 127.0.0.1 then u can check off downloading jdk from ur list of problems. if port forwarding dosent work also check your firewall and have it so it allows the port # which 43594 is default but use which ever port u used.</p>
