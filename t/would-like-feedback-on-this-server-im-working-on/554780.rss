    <title>Would like feedback on this server I&#39;m working on</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/would-like-feedback-on-this-server-im-working-on/554780</link>
    <description>There&#39;s nothing big on it yet, I&#39;ve gotten to the point where you can login and that&#39;s about it. Would like some feedback/criticism on what I have right now before continuing.

If you connect a client to the server it can login but after a couple second it disconnects; would anyone explain me why this is? (does it have to do with the client waiting for the player updating packet?)

Should I use ScheduledExecutorService for the CycleEngine instead of Timer? Since we&#39;re feeding the tick into any tick-related events this doesn&#39;t seem necessary.

Do I need to use a seperate thread if I wish to save players? Should I save cloned instances of players and if so, should I have to worry about instances of objects still being referenced in the clone?

Any code or design related comments are much appreciated as well.

edit: posted in wrong section.. this probably belongs in server help</description>

<p>read up a little on the reactor pattern (and why blocking IO doesn’t scale well). it’s super simple, a typical impl looks like</p>
<p>[code=java]selector.selectNow();<br>
Iterator $it = selector.selectedKeys().iterator();</p>
<p>while($it.hasNext()) {<br>
SelectionKey client = $it.next(); // “SelectionKey” refers to the Client we are handling events for</p>
<pre><code>if(!client.isValid()) {
    $it.remove(); // disconnected client, can't handle events for it
    continue;
}

try {
    if(client.isAcceptable()) {
        // Client is able to login. Perform any host filtering/throttling here, and prepare it for reading data
    } else if(client.isReadable()) {
        // Read data from the client here
    } else if(client.isWritable()) {
       // Write data to the client here
    }
} finally {
    $it.remove(); // Always remove the client when we're done handling events for it!
}
</code></pre>
<p>}<br>
[/code]</p>
<p>see? it’s all asynchronous… none of these methods block, they all return instantly. you don’t need a thread just to accept connections, it’s all done here meaning you can do this all on one thread if you really wanted to. it’s completely up to you</p>
<p>it’s a lot more flexible, you have full control over how you want to handle events:</p>
<ul>
<li>you can run the reactor on its own dedicated thread, queue packets over to the game thread (best solution)</li>
<li>you can do what blakeman8192 did with Runesource and run the reactor on the main game thread (every 600ms, less resource usage at the cost of longer login times)</li>
<li>you can even combine the above two with a “dual reactor” design and have login events handled on a dedicated thread but handle packets right on the game thread, kinda like the best of both worlds (pretty complicated, easy to fudge up)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/flimsy/asteria-2.0/blob/master/src/server/core/net/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here’s an implementation</a> of it I did a few years ago that uses the first solution, it’s really bad but it’ll give you an idea of how it works</p>
<p>Java 1.7 even shipped asynchronous NIO classes with callbacks, but that’s probably too complicated for now. stick to the above and you should be okay</p>

you don’t see it now because you haven’t even gotten to the point where you’re decoding packets. when you read data from the client using a client’s InputStream, it will block. so what does this mean? in order to have multiple players online at one time you’ll need to dedicate a thread for every single player (one thread that handles reading, for every single player)</p>

<p>to answer one of your questions, yes all I/O should be done asynchronously. that includes player saving. use <span class="bbcode-b">one</span> cached thread pool for all of that</p>

<p>unless you really know what you’re doing when it comes to networking you just should consider using <a href="http://netty.io/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Netty</a>. writing networking code without a nice abstraction layer that it provides will take you 3x as long. even worse, it will most likely perform much worse (nothing you or I write with “raw NIO” could come close to being better than Netty)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>plus it comes with a ton of useful features like its own ByteBuf (much better than java.nio.ByteBuffer), buffer pooling, etc. and does all of the ‘dirty’ and complicated work for you so all you have to do is plug in the code</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>if you don’t care for <span class="hashtag">#7</span>, at least take heed to this: you’re using blocking IO aka “thread per client” which means you’ll have to dedicate an IO thread to every single online player. if you aren’t going to use Netty, please at least use non-blocking IO</li>
</ol>
<p>all in all though do some research, learn more, and don’t give up… writing a server is a great learning experience. good luck man</p>

              <p>There’s nothing big on it yet, I’ve gotten to the point where you can login and that’s about it. Would like some feedback/criticism on what I have right now before continuing.</p>
<p>If you connect a client to the server it can login but after a couple second it disconnects; would anyone explain me why this is? (does it have to do with the client waiting for the player updating packet?)</p>
<p>Should I use ScheduledExecutorService for the CycleEngine instead of Timer? Since we’re feeding the tick into any tick-related events this doesn’t seem necessary.</p>
<p>Do I need to use a seperate thread if I wish to save players? Should I save cloned instances of players and if so, should I have to worry about instances of objects still being referenced in the clone?</p>
<p>Any code or design related comments are much appreciated as well.</p>
<p>edit: posted in wrong section… this probably belongs in server help</p>
