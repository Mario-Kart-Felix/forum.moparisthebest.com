    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-317-cache-maybe/542272</link>
    <description>hello,

I&#39;ve jared my client and I can see the background and different sprites ive put on it but when I share the jar with my mates they see the old background without the new sprites ive put in? 

i&#39;ve been told I need to repack my cache? Can someone help me with this do I need to download a program cause ive looked for loads and all links are down pretty much and then can someone help me with what I need to do once downloaded?
Thanks :p</description>

              <p>I had this trouble too ur gonna want them to delete the old cache then redownload ur new client<br>
oh and make sure that when u archive the zipped cache that once u open the cache u can see the sprites and anims and all that<br>
cause if u open the archive folder and all u see is just a folder that says cache it wont work right</p>

              <p>Probably your friends have the old cache, make sure in your new .jar the auto cache directory folder is renamed to something else, that way it would download the new cache and use that new cache on the new directory, instead of loading the old cache if you didn’t change the directory on your client.</p>

              <p>You need to upload the new version of the cache to dropbox, or whatever site you use to store your cache in. You’ll need to change the link in the cache downloader to the new link to download the new cache and create a new client. Don’t forget to compile either so it updates the link for the cache downloader.</p>
