    <title>Where is the main game loop in Hyperion(PJA)?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-is-the-main-game-loop-in-hyperion-pja/552030</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve taken a look at the way Hyperion handles events by queueing them up and dispatching threads to deal with them sequentially(i think). But something is bugging me, where is Hyperion&#39;s main game loop? I know according to Graham the server doesn&#39;t have a main game loop equivalent to run() in other servers, but, where can you even submit new events for the game engine to process? Is it 

[code]private void registerGlobalEvents() {Events}[/code]

?

If so does this mean you must register all events ahead of time? Also As I&#39;m using Project Anihilition(Which was built on top of Hyperion) my registerGlobalEvents() looks like this

[code]	private void registerGlobalEvents() {
		submit(new UpdateEvent());
		submit(new CleanupEvent());
		submit(new SkullEvent());
		submit(new RestoreEvent());
		submit(new RunEnergyEvent());
		submit(new SpecialUpdateEvent());
		submit(new WarriorGuildEvent());
		submit(new GroundItemEvent());
		submit(new SavingEvent());
		submit(new HolidayEvent());
	}[/code]

But i&#39;m noticing this doesn&#39;t contain network-related events(aside from UpdateEvent() which removes players if they are no longer connected). So where would networking events like, say, pressing a button be handled, I would imagine on a separate thread, but where exactly?</description>

<p>No. Also in GameEngine, there are different ExecutorServices. One is for logic, which I take is for game events, one is a BlockingExecutorService, which creates a thread pool based on the number of available CPU cores you have, for things that need to be executed in parallel, and another ExecutorService that runs in a single thread, intended for File IO and other blocking operations. There are also subclasses of <span class="bbcode-b">Task</span>, namely <span class="bbcode-b">ParallelTask</span>, and <span class="bbcode-b">ConsecutiveTask</span>. Depending on which one is used, it calls one of three methods in GameEngine; <span class="bbcode-b">submitTask</span>, <span class="bbcode-b">submitWork</span>, and <span class="bbcode-b">submitLogic</span> which tells the engine how to process that task. Also, you wouldn’t really need to worry about it “missing” a tick, unless that thread (which should be the <span class="bbcode-b">logic</span> thread) is taking &gt; 600ms to process everything, which shouldn’t really be the case because each of those services have their own thread.</p>

That is called a Task. You can submit them to the World instance and they will be ran once when suitable. An Event is basically a scheduled Task.</p>

<p>Hmm, take a look in the event dispatcher. I’ll go get the source code and take a look.</p>
<p>EDIT: Yeah, it looks like it’s done in GameEngine in the run() method:</p>
<p><code>
@Override
public void run() {
    try {
        while(running) {
            try {
                final Task task = tasks.take();
                submitLogic(new Runnable() {
                    @Override
                    public void run() {
                        task.execute(GameEngine.this);
                    }
                });
            } catch(InterruptedException e) {
                continue;
            }
        }
    } finally {
        logicService.shutdown();
        taskService.shutdown();
        workService.shutdown();
    }
}</code></p>
<p>GameEngine has its own thread. <span class="bbcode-b">tasks</span> is a <span class="bbcode-i">BlockingQueue</span> which means that the current thread will block until there is a task to take. And while it’s running, it will always try to take tasks to process. There’s a <span class="bbcode-i">stop</span> method that will interrupt the current thread (and interrupt the currently processing task, if there is one) and stop the server.</p>
