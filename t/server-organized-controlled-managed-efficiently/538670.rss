<span class="bbcode-i">Old, as most on Mopar.</span></p>
<p>What makes a server unique?<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">The content it contains. Less like RuneScape, more like private servers.</span></p>
<p>What you expect from?</p>
<ol>
<li>Staff - <span class="bbcode-i">Professionalism, helpfulness, friendliness. Nobody wants to be driven away by the staff members.</span>
</li>
<li>Developers - <span class="bbcode-i">Consistent updates. Their job description is to do just that, not tend to player needs. If they do not communicate with the community, that’s fine by me. As long as they’re doing their job making updates, I’m fine with it.</span>
</li>
<li>Website - <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">NOT</span> a frequently used template that you see every other server with. Organization.</span>
</li>
<li>Client - <span class="bbcode-i">To be able to connect to the server. To run smoothly.</span>
</li>
<li>Server - <span class="bbcode-i">Unique content.</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p>How updates should be managed?<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">As long as they’re updating, manage it however the owner likes. But always perform the ‘System Update:’ instead of randomly resetting the server. Once updates are complete, post them on the forums for the server.</span></p>
<p>How advertising should be done and where?<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Gold memberships in toplists. Sponsored spots. As your answer to ‘where?’, in the larger toplists. I suppose Google advertisements couldn’t hurt, but, in my opinion, they’re a waste of money. And when I say “sponsored spots”, I don’t mean the big 728x90 pixel banners. They should look like a listing in the toplist, just above all the other servers in the list. If it’s a big banner, it looks more like an advertisement and will receive less clicks.</span></p>
<p>What content must be present?<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Private servers are a fun way to kill time. Time consumption content must be present. Though, nothing like staring at your character woodcut for half an hour. They must be interactive and enjoyable. Such as pking, minigames, etc. However, skilling is still a large factor. There are quite a bit of skillers in the RuneScape private server community, believe it or not.</span></p>

              <p>Just a quick opinion of my own. The grouping should be more-so (in my opinion):</p>
<p>[OLD:0-whenever old graphics stopped, 498ish?] [MID:whenever old graphics stopped - 562] [NEW:563-Modern]</p>
<p>its messy and confusing but you get my point. i personally think the graphics got out of hand after that 562 era. it was perfectly fine then, but you know when we get into our 600 era shit just ew</p>

OLD or NEWER</p>
<p>What makes a server unique?<br>
-Stuff like your client, unique home, complete content, fun interaction. A challenge.</p>
<p>What you expect from?</p>
<ol>
<li>Staff - Being involved with the community such as “Hide n Seek” “Trivia” and playing minigames with players.</li>
<li>Developers - Being dedicated, they don’t have to be SUPER active, but pushing updates.</li>
<li>Website - It’s not all about the website, but a nice webclient and good looking forums is nice.</li>
<li>Client - The way I see your client going is great, it’s looking really good. No customs though.</li>
<li>Server - All the stuff I listed on “Unique”</li>
</ol>
<p>How updates should be managed?<br>
Updates batches, wait til you have enough updates to release a batch. Test it on a version on your pc before restarting the server, etc.</p>
<p>How advertising should be done and where?<br>
lol. Youtube, rsps toplists, paying money.</p>
<p>What content must be present?<br>
Something that is playabale. I don’t want to login and play for half an hour and have 99 stats. Try a lot of quests and add a lot of benefits to them. Don’t have expensive stuff in the shops, keep it simple.</p>
