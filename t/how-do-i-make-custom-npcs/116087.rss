    <title>How do I make custom NPCs?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-make-custom-npcs/116087</link>
    <description>No, I don&#39;t mean how do I spawn NPCs.  I mean, how can I configure an NPC&#39;s appearance like I can a regular player.  Also I need to know how to give them things like different weapons and armor.

I think I saw how in the no-dummies client (The one that renamed most of the garbage, awesome btw) because in the player.java (client side) there was a lot of stuff dealing with equips.  The NPC.java (client side) was a lot smaller and did not contain any of that.  Unfortunately, I know that I will guarantee a screw-up if I try to amend any of these codes, so if anyone can help I would greatly appreciate it.</description>
