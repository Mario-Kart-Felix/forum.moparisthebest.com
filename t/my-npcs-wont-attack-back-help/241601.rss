    <description>Please help me. When someone attacks an npc in my server it will hit you one time and then not hit you anymore. I need it to keep hitting you. What do I have to do and edit? I&#39;m not the best coder either. I already searched on the forums here for the solution and I checked on Google. If you end up do finding it..Don&#39;t just post here &quot;I searched it in the search bar and it popped up..check before you post&quot; and then lock the thread. If you do find it please post it here. I need it.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 08, 2008, 12:52:17 am[/size][hr]ok..ive waited 3 days and still nothing..im bumping my thread</description>
