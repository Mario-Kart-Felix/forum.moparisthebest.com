    <description>Hello there, this is my nooby account so i will get right to it.
I&#39;m an experienced coder looking for a coding partner in my new
server Cerberus. Cerberus is very well coded all ready however it&#39;s
no fun coding it on your own. [u][b]A 24/7 hoster has been found[/b][/u] and a
site has already been made. Now all i need is a fellow coder..

[b]Incredible stability, can hold 200+ players.
Full herblore with working potions. (Thanks to &#39;Rich)
Full slayer tower.
All item requirements.

All NPC&#39;s currently move.

Barrows (could be improved).
Anti SYI (Removed thread per client).
Anti Dupe.
Anti Cheat/Hax command.
Woodcutting works.

              <p>I dont use Delta! Your right it’s too much overused. This source is original and was programmed by me of the original Devolution V6.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: January 30, 2009, 09:50:33 am[/size][hr]Plus if i dont know how to code how come i added all those features myself? I personally think it’s boring coding a server on your<br>
own but hey… what would you know you dont get much human contact do you?</p>

              <p>Do you need a full time moderator for your server? I’m not experianced in java coding but i’d say i’m really good with players. Finding proper moderators is kinda’ tough these days anyways, Need some help? Because i’d be glad, i can also Beta Test <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
