Iv been stressing over this for a very long time and no 1 seems to know. all i know so far is

it is in combatassist.java

and i turned smite into soul split so i was guessing this was the orignal code

[code]public void applySmite(int index, int damage) {
		if (!c.prayerActive[23])
			return;
		if (damage &lt;= 0)
			return;
		if (Server.playerHandler.players[index] != null) { 
			Client c2 = (Client)Server.playerHandler.players[index];
			c2.playerLevel[5] -= (int)(damage/4);
			if (c2.playerLevel[5] &lt;= 0) {
				c2.playerLevel[5] = 0;
				c2.getCombat().resetPrayers();
			}
			c2.getPA().refreshSkill(5);
		}
	
	}[/code]

if not the right spot. tell me were. cuz i was told just to search the smite. but theres like 4 smites in combat assist searches all with diffrent things. anyways please help me rewrite the code so it gives 1/5hp everyhit and if any one knows how i can make it do the gfx everytime it heals the hp that would be great.



Theiving only works if u go south to the object and click on it other then that it wont work how can i fix it so it works all around</description>
