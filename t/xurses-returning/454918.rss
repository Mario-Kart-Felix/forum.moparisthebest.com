    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/xurses-returning/454918</link>
    <description>[size=8pt]I am looking for a client helper, someone who knows the basis, how to change the ip address in client.java and how to compile and change a batch file to you&#39;re java version. this person will be able to get admin on my server once i get it up and running.

I will be looking for a full team once I get this up. and will have pictures etc. since this is development and i am on the first stages, i suppose this is where to put this.

this is what we are starting with:

[url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,500947.msg3664621.html#msg3664621[/url]Xurses release by myself.[/url]

Going to clean some of it and I retook the old brokenX client which use to be my base since I messed up the Jframe in the past.

client download:
http://up.ht/OLLCYY
http://uppit.com/b59e411c502y/BrokenX_Client.7z
Port was changed to 80, my noip is xursescontinues.zaptop.org 
and my ipaddress is 173.245.64.15
if someone can download and or use a premade webclient to check it will be appreciated.[/size]</description>
