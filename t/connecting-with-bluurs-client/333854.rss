    <description>[b]Why am i making this tutorail?[/b] -Ok this is super simple! and i have had about 5 friends in the passed week almost quit their servers because they got confused.

[b]What is this tutorial about?[/b] - When you have a bluur client you can only connect to you server using a Local Ip. When other people connect to you sever using a bluurs base client they need the server ip.

[b]What will we be doing in this tutorial? [/b]- I will be showing you how to make you client ip to local host, so you can connect to your server!

[b]Step 1[/b] - Open ip you GUI.java, Search for your server ip. Example (Chosenpkz.no-ip.com) once you have located your ip, change to to 127.0.0.1, this will allow you to connect locally and you can also edit you server using 127.0.0.1 youll never need to use your server ip again.

Compile &amp; your finished, its that simple this will allow you to connect to your own server while other players are on!</description>
