    <title>Real Runescape just. . . Private</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/real-runescape-just-private/397485</link>
    <description>Hey guys.  So maybe this is a stupid question but what would it take to get the most current code for runescape and make a private server out of it.  For example, it would, hopefully, be just like normal RuneScape:  The Entire world, All the Quests, Full Screen, etc.  The only difference, hopefully, would be that you could make changes at will:  Commands, Faster xp, free members, stuff like this.
Would this be possible?  Is it even worth trying? 
Thanks.
And by the way, why is it that most private servers are 317?</description>

              <p>Jagex has never, and will never release their code. Private Servers are at the simplest form, a protocol. Just like HTTP, FTP, and IRC.</p>
<p>What we do as developers, since we don’t have any of their code, is observe how the client interacts with the server. From those interactions, we can make a “best guess” on how the server functions, and emulate that behavior. This is why I prefer to use the term RuneScape Emulator, instead of Private Server.</p>
<p>To learn how emulators work, I would first take a look at how the 317 protocol functions. However, due to the nature of game programming, if you don’t already know the language, you will quickly learn bad habits. Evidence of this is the many server bases that exist today.</p>
<p>The reason that most private servers are <span class="hashtag">#317</span> is simply because it’s the most documented, and most understood. Lin is/was working on a <span class="hashtag">#355</span> just to do something different. He had to work harder however because there was no existing documentation. The way 317s function today is unchanged up until <span class="hashtag">#469</span> (or <span class="hashtag">#474</span> if I’m mistaken). After that, Jagex threw the many communities a curve ball when <span class="hashtag">#503</span> arrived. Instead of all the objects in the world being found in the cache, the client then requested the map data or more appropriately, XTEA keys, from the server when the player entered a new region. This is also another reason why <span class="hashtag">#317s</span> are more common than other revisions. To have any objects appear (trees, crates, etc), you had to have the map data. You didn’t have to worry about that with# 317s.</p>
<p>Anything after <span class="hashtag">#503</span>/<span class="hashtag">#508</span> I didn’t care to look into. In my opinion, if you didn’t have a complete map, you didn’t have a complete game.</p>

<p>317 servers are easy to code and imo I think they are more fun than the newer ones, tbh I don’t like the new graphics on the 614 or whatever.</p>

              <p>317 is probably the most simplest revision to code. Many people have tried to get the exact runescape but it has failed. The only thing you have access to is the cache which is mostly just the images and maps. You have to rebuild everything else.</p>
