    <title>Where the hell do I buy spray gun paint in the uk?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-the-hell-do-i-buy-spray-gun-paint-in-the-uk/441477</link>
    <description>Cross-post from MITB:

I&#39;ll keep it short and sweet, I need a low voc paint that&#39;s preferably legal in the uk, that I can use with a spray gun(for an air compressor), and can be used to spray a motorcycle(mostly plastic fairings, metal tank). I&#39;ll be painting it white which provides an additional problem since I also need a gas/petrol resistant lacquer preferably or a clear top coat that won&#39;t turn the white paint yellow and follows the same guidelines. 

I need low voc paint since I will be doing it as an amateur in my garden, that is, I won&#39;t have much in the way of safety gear other than eye protection, basic face mask and perhaps coveralls, so 2k and cellulose paint is absolutely out of the question.</description>

<p>2k paint requires a full air fed respirator and full skin protection as it is highly toxic and can kill you, not only that it’s generally illegal to buy anywhere unless you are a professional and have met all the health and safety requirements</p>
<ul>
<li>everyone says to ask a paint shop for advice, this advice should be on the internet for free god damnit we live in the information age</li>

              <p>Niall, if your not going to be using 2k paint, etc, it will be pretty hard to find a spray gun for paint, and especially if it’s legal. You should ask your nearest mechanic for some advice.</p>
