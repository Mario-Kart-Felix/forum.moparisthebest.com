    <description>Not new, but I just recently watched this and it really bothers me.

http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/05/videotape-of-kelly-thomas-beating-rattles-courtroom.html
&lt;blockquote&gt;A videotape showing police beating victim Kelly Thomas elicited gasps and groans in a Santa Ana courtroom on Monday.

At one point, the judge stopped the tape and asked those who could not handle viewing it to leave the courtroom.

A shirtless Kelly Thomas is shown being hit again and again with fists, a baton and finally the butt of a stun gun by Fullerton police officers. In the video he can be heard repeatedly saying he&#39;s sorry and asking for his father.

Thomas&#39; father, Ron Thomas, said the hardest part of the video and audio &quot;is the sounds of my son calling out.&quot;

The preliminary hearing continues Tuesday with more testimony from medical experts and perhaps some presentation from the defense.

The grainy black-and-white video of Thomas&#39; violent encounter with police outside a bus depot is the centerpiece of the prosecution&#39;s case against two officers accused of escalating a standard police encounter with a homeless man into a fatal beating.

At one point, Thomas — a 37-year-old mentally ill homeless man who was a familiar face in the city&#39;s downtown — screams out: &quot;Dad, they are killing me!&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

              <p>Sad. It’s disappointing to see. I remember for the democratic nation convention in Denver all the homeless people were shuffled off the street to be groomed and put into temporary hotels until it was over. They’re treated like dirt. Its pretty cool how high quality of a video this is and that you can clearly hear the audio of the police officers conversations.</p>
