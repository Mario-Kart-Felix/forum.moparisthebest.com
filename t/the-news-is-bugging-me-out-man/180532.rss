    <title>The news is bugging me out man</title>

    <description>Sometimes I like watching the news and now when I say sometimes what I really mean is [b]never[/b] because it&#39;s too damn [font=GeSHi]scary [/font]these days.


I was watching the MSNBC last night and every time somebody was talking about anything they used the word surge. For example 
[i]&quot;Barak Obama surged past Hilary Clinton in Iowa&quot;. [/i]


Sometimes they would use &#39;The Word&#39; when it wasn&#39;t even remotely appropriate. 
[i]&quot;Hmm, Tucker, would it be safe to say that Britney Spears has completely surged herself out?&quot;[/i] [i]&quot;Yes, I think, why, Yes Tom, I do think she has quite completely surged, and now let&#39;s surge over to Bill with the weather.&quot;[/i] [i]&quot;Oh, hi Tucker, the rain is really surging down here in...&quot;[/i]


I watched for two more hours waiting in vain for any mention of the war. Wait...We&#39;re in a war? When did this happen? Watching the news one might be under the impression that the most important thing which has occurred in the past few days was a slip in Lindsay Lohans sobriety. 
And yet they still manage to say the word &quot;Surge&quot; every other word. 


Weren&#39;t the swooping 3D American flags and &quot;Operation Iraqi Freedom!&quot; in red white and blue with martial drumbeats echoing away in the background warning enough, Paul? You should know by now how those sik basterds work and just give up. Let yourself flow into the propaganda matrix. There is no spoon. Ahhh.</description>
