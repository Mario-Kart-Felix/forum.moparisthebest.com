    <description>First, about Core inspect:

http://minerealm.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=6781

That is how to use it. Now onto the rules:

1. Griefing
- should depend on the extent, and whether or not the person was aware of the rule.  If a few blocks were destroyed, or if they tried to &#39;improve&#39; someone elses building, a simple verbal warning should be sufficient.  If they did it out of spite for some reason or another, then maybe a 1 week ban should be done on the first offense, later offenses can be punished heavier, but we don&#39;t need to be that harsh on griefing, since it can just be rolled back.  You also have to POST ABOUT THE INFRACTIONS so we know about how often a certain person offends.

2. Impersonation, this rule matters no longer, as it&#39;s impossible to do.  If someone logs on with moparsthbest or Moparisthbest or something similar, a warning and name ban should suffice.

3. Flying, a warning should suffice for first offense, subsequent offenses should probably have a few day ban, if they don&#39;t stop, post about it and we will discuss a punishment. (Though this is no longer possible due to Minecraft auto-kicking anybody who does it, they can still speed hack without flying so use the above guidelines in such situations).

4. PVP, there should be no PVP in a killing/damaging aspect AT ALL. This isn&#39;t possible to do directly, but this rule includes traps and so on. If a player does this they should be warned, and if they carry on they should be banned.

5. What is said in this section stays in this section, failure to comply with this will result in demotion. Please bear in mind some moderators like to keep their names out of a situation, you should always assume a moderator doesn&#39;t want their name mentioned unless they specifically state otherwise.

[size=24pt]You need to post when you ban or warn someone, and if you don&#39;t feel like doing this, just resign now or I&#39;ll be forced to remove your rank.  The website staff follow the same rule.[/size]</description>
