    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-525-source-crash-fixed/508986</link>

(Source run.bat not client)

I think problem is on client.. 1 client worked perfectly but it was S**T ip changer client

BUT! problem can be at java version because few years ago i coded 525 server and same source but it won&#39;t work now:(

Got it! downloaded old JRE java :) THX ANYWAY!</description>
