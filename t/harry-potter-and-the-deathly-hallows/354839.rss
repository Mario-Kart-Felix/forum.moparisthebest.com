    <description>Hey guys, just wondering your opinions on the new Harry Potter movie coming out (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows).

I&#39;m a big fan of these movies, I own a copy of all the DVDS. You can watch the trailer [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EC2tmFVNNE] here. [/url] (Watch it in HD for better quality).

Part I hits theaters on November 19th, 2010.

Its also coming out in 3D in selected cinemas.

Note: Watch the trailer before you post.</description>

Most likely.<br>
Although, had she written another one, I don’t think I could’ve come to reading it.  I got bored with the series after 5, but being I had read them up to that point, had to finish.</p>

<p>Yes.  I actually haven’t cared much for the movies, but I’m a die-hard reader, so movies are just bleh when based off of a book.<br>
Example: Eragon. Good book and series, dead awful movie.<br>

<p>Ah yes the Eragon book series was epic but the movie was absolutely terrible…</p>

I found book 7 to be completely forced it was evident that the author had no interest in writing it. The movie is going to really have to develop more of its own content if it wants to make two movies from the pile of rubbish Rowling provided them.<br>

<p>I wouldn’t agree with this really…she was pretty dedicated about writing those books, except maybe the 7th, but I still enjoyed it and I think the movie will be alright in 2 parts.</p>

<p>Yeah, I mean it wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t really good either. It was just normal… My favorite is Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone (the first one). Usually the first ones are always the best.</p>
