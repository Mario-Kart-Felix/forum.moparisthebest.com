    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runserver-problem-and-no-ip-problem/295164</link>
    <description>ok i made a copy to dropbox my source to my co owner right.
well when he went to edit the source file it wouldnt work on the server when he compiled.
so i sent him another copy
still nothing



eventually i ended up with a bunch of copies and now none of my source files (Run)
stopped running (my) server

so i was logged on from localhost on a server no1 else could log into

sdhould i delete all my sources except the 1 i did most editing from then download the exact same source again then copy and paste my stuff back into it??


also i changed my server ip and when i go to post new server ip on any sites i cant cuz it says its already taken.


and ive searched it and its not.
my co owner said t sas error like its not even online any help please?</description>
