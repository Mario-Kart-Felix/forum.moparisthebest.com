    <description>k first
i was wondering if it is possible to change the time limit of a tele block.. Becuz when i make a tele and say [code]teleblock = true;[/code] i don&#39;t want it to be a full tele block, just for a little while, like say 2 or 3 minutes if that&#39;s possible plz explain how.

and second, i was wondering if there is some way that if you tele somehwere you can not log out for say like 2 or 3 minutes, or you can log out, but then you have to wait a few minutes to get back in.  But only when they tele to that place.

plz help if you can.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: May 31, 2009, 02:26:26 pm[/size][hr]anyone?</description>
