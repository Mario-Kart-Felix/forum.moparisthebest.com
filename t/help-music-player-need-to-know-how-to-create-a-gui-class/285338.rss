    <title>HELP Music Player. Need to know how to create a gui.class!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-music-player-need-to-know-how-to-create-a-gui-class/285338</link>
    <description>Yo guys, i need help making a music player from SCRATCH.
So, can you tell me what needed to be made, and how it&#39;s made, and where it needs to be placed.
Thanks guys!!!! Ive searched a TuT on forums for making new files, a new class file, helped a little bit but i still don&#39;t no where to start!!
All i need is a gui interface, doesn&#39;t even have to have anything in-it! Then, from there i will be able to make a music tab
