aryan was a java client<br>
it used javascript for it’s autoing scripts<br>
used it’s own mouse (u could play computer and auto at same time with this feature)<br>
you could multilog (auto on 7vrel accounts at once)<br>
it had state of the art anti randoms <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>You tell everyone to shush-up after bumping up a 1 month old thread… lol</p>
<p>Oh and whoever you quoted is wrong. Scripts were made in Java, not JavaScript. And it uses action-forcing, not it’s own mouse.</p>
