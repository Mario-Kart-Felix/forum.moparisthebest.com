    <description>Hey Guys,
Its a bit odd because i made a server and got my friends to download Hamachi and Moparscape, then we played for a while but i got bored so i closed the server.
A Few days ago 1 of my friends accused me of making him download a Trojan. (Which was surposibly in the Moparscape file) I just laugh at him cause he said he needed to reformat his computer and said there wouldnt be because heaps of people play it and dont you think someone would find it if its there.
A Few days later my other friend also seems to think that he found a trojan from Moparscape in his Free Version of AVGs Virus Vault, I looked in my and there was none.
Now he just told me that he did a system restore to before he download Moparscape and he doesnt have the trojan. I think this is Bogas.
So im just asking, Sometimes you need somestuff that will seem to be viruses to make something, but really they are doing something for the program, like Cookies or something.
Wanting to know if this is true (there is a trojan) or if anyone else has spotted this because my friends keep bugging me and giving them a bloody Trojan</description>

Can a Trojan do this?<br>
And he is just guessing its Mopar cause the other 2 are</p>

              <p>A lot of virus scanners go crazy over batch files, and server sources and the moparscape client comes with batch files.</p>
<p>So the virus scanner probably thought the batch files was a trojan.</p>
