    <description>hello, before i begin this is not about me hacking or anything like that.
first off, my laptop got a virus and its a bitch. first it deletes everything on your computer, system restore, notepad, internet explorer, everything, you cant access any files. whatever your background was it changes to black, then tons of error messages come up saying files are corrupt, all of a sudden a fake system restore pops up, and starts to download more files saying its fixing it, then it wants you to edit your credit card number to pay to fix the situation, it also disables your firewall and allows all ports. its a windows xp, with mcafee antivirus.
by the way, this is my school laptop, i brought it to the tech person at my school to fix it, and she gave me a spare laptop for the time being, right when i got it, i walked back to class, i then turned on the computer, everything ok, then when i logged in i get the same virus as i did before. tomarrow i am getting another spare, i think the virus is on my log in account and getting on the computer, [b]every log in has their own personal harddrive to save their files[/b]. i dont know, i really never had a virus this bad, if anyone could help me id be happy because she makes us pay to fix our laptops and if i keep getting computers viruses cause of my log in or someone else got the same virus then im gonna have to pay for it.
okay so what can i do to fix the virus.</description>
