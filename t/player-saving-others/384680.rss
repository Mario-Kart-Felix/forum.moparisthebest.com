    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-saving-others/384680</link>
    <description>No idea my base source, ill give link to what i got. http://www.roon server.org/runescape-development/google/downloads/219499-317-server-client-cache-3.html#post2534804

Well the source is a piece of shit but im trying to make it better. well, when I log in an account theres always random items, and usually some over the max limit of the 317 cache, so i removed that, but when I log in now theres all dwarf remains in equip tab.

Dwarf remains in equip tab (FIXED)
How I fixed: go to player.java, search random until it comes to like a playerequipment with random, and delete that ad make it -1.

I log out and it says error writing file
could not save for: player

Player saving (not fixed)

Following doesn&#39;t work
