    <description>I have two things I need to fix on my server, when a person buys a item in a store on my server and they click buy 50 it sells them 10, and when they click but 1, it sells them 5.. where would i go to fix this?

and my other question is.. when a player is afk on my server, and it logs them out about 30 seconds later since there not active, where would i change this to about 10 minutes or something like that?
