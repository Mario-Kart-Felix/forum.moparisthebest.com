    <title>Merging character databases between two sources</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/merging-character-databases-between-two-sources/441119</link>
    <description>This may seem like a stupid question, and I know it is very possible, but what would be the easiest and cleanest way to merging a character database between two servers. For example, I&#39;ll host two servers on two separate ports, but what I want to do is enable it to where the servers load the character files from one database. In my case, what I want to do is load the character files from a folder, so you can easily switch &quot;worlds&quot; and still have the same account, like RS does.

Would there be any issues with this, and if so, please explain. Also, if there is any other type of way to accomplish this, I&#39;d love to hear that, too. Thanks.

Sorry if I mistyped/confused you, but I&#39;m at school and had to rush this post due to class changing.</description>
