    <title>GoDaddy</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/godaddy/395368</link>
    <description>Okay, I think this is the right place to put this. :| Okay, so, I created 3 subdomains using godaddy.  The thing is, that none of them work.  It&#39;s supposed to go to the folder I choose or w\e, but instead of going to the folder or something, it just says &quot;Sorry, the site is not currently available.&quot;  Is there anything I should do, besides call them?  I don&#39;t like calling them, I&#39;m 14. :p
[b]EDIT:[/b]Now, they all redirect to my forums...  Could it be because of my .htaccess file?</description>

<p>When I click on your website in your Signature, everything works fine. It points to /ipb because that’s the forum’s ‘callsign’. Much like you cannot access a file inside of your C:\System\ file without \System. /ipb/ websites can’t be accessed without /ipb/ because  /ipb/ is more or less of a placeholder for all of the systems components, modules, etc…</p>
<p>In easier terms.<br>
Think of /ipb/ as a sandwhich. If you have peanut butter and jelly and bread. You have peanut butter and jelly and bread. But when you put them together you have an sandwhich.<br>
You have a website. Buttons. Threads. And when you put them together. You have /ipd/</p>
<p>EITHER WAY. Everything is fine and working.</p>

<p>No, no, no.  Lmfao.

<p>Well don’t I feel silly. Though my specialty is nowhere near networking and stuff. I’d imagine that your subdomains are set to redirect to  /ipb/. When I had a website a few years ago, I had my main domain _<strong><strong><strong>.com. And then I had a few subdomains ___.</strong></strong></strong>.com that were set to automatically redirect to my main domain. Other than that small bit of info. I’m not really sure. As I said, networking and web is not my forte.[/quote]</p>
<p>[code]hiscore<br>

They all don’t point to /ipb/…</p>
