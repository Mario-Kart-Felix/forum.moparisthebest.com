You people are obsessed lol. Winterlove is a guy who made some great hacks for runescape 2 cheating. He ended up writing a private server in c/c++ that was never released afaik. He ported it to Java so all the private server noobs would shutup. His plan worked and he probably doesn’t give a second shit about the mopar community, hence why he never visits.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Would these private server noobs have anything to do with xero, or any of those other faggots who talk to each other using comments throughout the server?[/quote]</p>
<p>Some of them. The comments were created by the major developers throughout the early months. Many of them include Wolf, Xeroz, Phate, etc.</p>
