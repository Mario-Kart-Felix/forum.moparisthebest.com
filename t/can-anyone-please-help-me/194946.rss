    <description>On my some of my clients I downloaded like FrozenAge Client, icerealm client, and dogs client.

When i load it, it comes up with a place for my username, password, server IP, and port (not in that order tho) and the port isn&#39;t filled with what it says in the client.java where it says that the port = 43594 it is filled with &quot;null&quot;

Please help, Thanks.</description>
