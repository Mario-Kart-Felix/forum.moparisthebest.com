    <title>Java question pl0x</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-question-pl0x/374371</link>
    <description>Hey: is it possible to store a used integer into another so I can use the second integer to define the coordinates of the first.
For example if I used the absX from my client.java to define where a player is standing and then stored that and then the player moved and I used the stored integer to put something in the player&#39;s previous location.

Is this possible? and if so can you lead me to the correct place.</description>

              <p>Hey, cheers for the informative post man… What I was working towards was firemaking. By storing where the player WAS standing when he lit the fire like</p>
<p>light fire{<br>
storecoord;<br>
}</p>
<p>and then put the stored coord and put the ashes down in a certain amount of time…and delete the fire object.</p>
