    <title>Physics Question (Simple)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/physics-question-simple/124042</link>
    <description>For some reason I have been hearing this a lot lately. This is just one of the mind blowing things you pick up in AP Physics 30 (12). I studied super hard for the diploma (final exam) and it turned out to be a really simple 5 minute questions that involve you to use 2 different concepts ie: (nuclear fission &amp; conservation of momentum).. Anyways,



2 Radio station news reporters are sitting 1 meter apart.
News reporter #1: Speaks into a microphone

Will the person in a car 22 miles away hear (News reporter #1) earlier then news reporter #2 due to speed of EMR being faster then the speed of sound?</description>

              <p>Perhaps I misunderstand (or this is a different question), but I don’t see where nuclear fission and conservation of momentum come into play here…</p>
<p>Anyway, sound in air travels at approx. 344 m/s - I think that’s accurate enough for this case.  So the time of travel is 1 / (344 m/s) or 0.002907 s/m (approx) since they are 1 meter apart.</p>
<p>I do not know the workings of microphones and radio broadcasting (assuming you’re not using satellite radio), so I’m initially making the assumption that the time it takes for the sound to be converted into EMR waves and broadcasted as well as it being converted back into sound waves by the listener is negligible.  Assuming a direct (straight line) broadcast between the reporter and the listener:</p>
<p>22 miles = 35405.568 meters<br>
c = 299,792,458 m/s (although its slightly slower in air, the refractive index is quite small - anyway, this is more accurate than 3 x 10^8 m/s)</p>
<p>1 / (299,792,458 m/s) * 35405.568 m = 0.0001181 s</p>
<p>So based on that, light traverses 22 miles 24.6 times faster than sound travels 1 meter.  I believe if you take into consideration the time it takes for the radio broadcaster and radio receiver to run, it will roughly even out.  But you cannot accurately guess that from the information given.  So your answer would probably be yes…the guy in the car will hear it before the guy in the studio.</p>
