        <p>The day they sell XP boosts will be a very sad day indeed. Like I said in my first reply, I don’t mind this update because everything is cosmetic, and I actually think it’s a good way to keep the game profitable while not changing gameplay too much. If they do end up selling XP boosts or other non-cosmetic things, that’s when I will start to worry about this :\</p>

<p>I think I read this one in the forums, probably in some FAQ thread but I read that they sure need more money to keep up with expanding the game, reliable servers, blablabla.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<blockquote>[b]Why are you charging for items?[/b]
<p>The new Customisation System requires a lot more development effort per item, and we’re also taking longer when making the content to make sure it’s extra special. By charging for the items themselves it means we don’t pass on these costs on to those who aren’t interested in using them.</p>
</blockquote>Somewhat similar to what I said above.

<p>You might want to do some research on the matter. That’s your opinion. Also, starting a sentence about being uneducated with the word “And”?[/quote]No, it’s not an opinion. Saying that Jagex no longer cares about the game is an opinion, but saying that I dislike people who make judgement based on things they know nothing about is not an opinion, it’s me stating a fact of my state of being. If you knew anything about these updates, like the SOF and now this, you’d know Jagex doesn’t WANT to do them, but their financial status requires them to unless they want to go out of business. People say ‘remove the bots’, and then they say ‘wow youre adding more money making things’ without realizing that Jagex NEEDS to do this. If you look at what they are doing, it’s CLEAR (and I really can’t put more emphasis on that, because anyone with half a brain SHOULD be able to see this) that they care about the game and are trying to make it more enjoyable for the legitimate players. Bonfires, RuneSpan, etc, all indicate that they want to make the game less ‘grindy’ and more fun for people that actually play. Why would they spend months (or years, I forgot their timeframe) on a massive game rework for this new combat update, if they didn’t care about the game? They aren’t making a profit directly on this update, so surely it would be ‘better’ (by your logic) to just keep churning out small updates that keep the people interested enough to buy more of these micro-transaction things. I suggest you look at something like old RuneFest videos, or Jmod podcasts, before you make assumptions on Jagex’s motives with their game. Personally I’ve been playing this game for 8 years, and these updates from the past year have definitely been better than the ones from the 3 or 4 prior to that, almost on par with what they used to do back in the old days. These extra money making methods are required, and while yes, I don’t agree with some of them (like the SOF gamble/xp/money rewards), I personally think this update is exactly what Jagex should be doing if they need more money.</p>

<p>I started earlier than 2004. I said I’ve been playing every bit of 8 years as well. I’m not and never have been on a bandwagon when it comes to JaGex. I thought I’d post my personal opinion on how I see things. I don’t need to provide you with evidence, I’ve been playing long enough to see the evidence first-hand. If you know how RuneScape works then you’ll know what I mean by quality required.</p>

<p>So your attitude is “my opinion is better than yours and matters because I said so”. Those little icons are going to your head, my friend. A lot of people value my opinion, so I thought I’d give my input. I’m sorry that we can’t agree to disagree, but whatever.</p>

<p>EDIT: I’ll agree to disagree with you.[/quote]No, the evidence is not there. At all. You have yet to show anything. That’s like me saying “the evidence for God is right in front of you and you should know it if you’ve ever heard of him.” And then if you ask me what evidence that is, I can just say “you know what I’m talking about.” Fact is I would have no real evidence offhand, but I can twist my vague details to make you think like I have some (even if it’s just in my head).</p>
<p>Point is you haven’t made any so called “claims” at all? All you’ve done is state your opinions in how jagex ‘standards’ are dropping or their ‘quality required’ is going down. You haven’t even insinuated as to what these might MEAN, let alone provide any examples for them.</p>
<p>Sure, we can agree to disagree, but it’s probably just because you wouldn’t want me to ruin the fun of you being able to hate on JaGex without any cause besides those made up (or exaggerated) in your head. Ok, so I shouldn’t say without ANY cause, because I do not deny JaGex is definitely not close to perfect. But this is all in relation to this update, which I believe was the best move they could have made short of just asking for donations.</p>

<p>I already told you what I meant by quality. I’m not twisting anything, I don’t understand why you’ve gotten so worked up over nothing. Everyone’s going to have different thoughts on the matter. There are many people who agree with you, and many who agree with me.</p>
<p>EDIT: I’ve played this game for a very long time, that’s how I feel about it.</p>
<p>DOUBLE EDIT: I want to agree to disagree with you so we can both forget about this little dispute without anyone getting angry.</p>
