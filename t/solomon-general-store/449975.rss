    <description>So what do you guys think of the new update?

Here is a video preview:
[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiJ9WuFTl2w[/youtube]

I personally think it&#39;s not such a bad update, people are now ranting at RS forums that Jagex once again tries to milk out money but where is the harm in that? If you don&#39;t like it then don&#39;t buy. The emotes, animations and outfits are awesome. The only thing I don&#39;t like is that we get 200 free RuneCoins, but each outfit set is 216, so you&#39;re forced to pay $4.99 and get 200 more coins to have enough for the costume you like.</description>

You can’t defend your beliefs without at least doing one of the others, which is what he wasn’t doing (trying to defend without explaining). If he has just said his beliefs and then not replied when I disagreed there would have been no issue, but instead he tried to come and defend his belief without explaining anything  :rolleyes:</p>
<p>@ Rest of your post - Your post is a good example of defending your beliefs with good explanation, and I don’t disagree with you. It’s pretty much what I was saying, they still care about the game, but they are doing a few things in the wrong way. But personally I feel like this update is one of the few things they could have done to make more money without further ruining the game (but I couldn’t tell what your opinion was on this specific update as you didn’t mention it)</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Jagex is criticized by a large portion of the community; popular comments I’ve seen in people’s “I hate Jagex” topics include “They don’t care about the game” or “They only want the money”, etc. These comments and opinions aren’t expressed by whining (younger) members, it’s even a serious opinion that’s expressed by the more matured and intellectual members of  the RuneScape community.</p>
<p>Their developer diaries tell us that the X_Update that was the cause for an upheaval was a large amount of work for them. If they truly did not care about the problem at hand, they could have just as easily released another random quest or another update of that nature to further expand the game. Sure, we do pay them (through the fees associated with membership and through the ads we’re forced to view), but we would have been paying them the same amount to write-up that random quest or expansive  content! Instead they took the initiative and time to have a go at fixing X_Problem with their X_Update. They’re trying to improve RuneScape.</p>
<p>With nearly every update done, good, bad, or otherwise, there will always be criticism from someone. Yet, they still push forward and release their content. With every update that we label as unfortunate, it only shows that Jagex is not afraid to take the steps needed to mold the game into their own, special creation. That shows a company who isn’t too afraid of upsetting their (paying) audience to do things that need doing. I give them kudos for that.</p>
<p>Here’s where it becomes complicated. On one hand, Jagex is willing to do controversial updates to eradicate botting scum from the game. On the other hand, they have (and still are) seriously annoyed (annoying) many players in the process of doing it, quite a fair few being legitiment paying customers. Jagex presumably doesn’t mind losing some people’s ongoing subscriptions; if in the process they’re furthering their progress in their game. This shows that they can’t be purely interested in the money if they’re willing to risk losing subscriptions when they do improve RuneScape. How far could Jagex change the game to get rid of bots before YOU get upset?</p>
<p>People hate Jagex for not caring, for only being interested in the money, for being too afraid to do what needs doing. With that being said, there are many, many reasons to be annoyed at Jagex, but most of those reasons aren’t valid. Jagex has made it clear that they’re pulling out all the stops to tackle X_Problem, despite the cost to themselves. That deserves the respect of their continued player-base. We can, however, remain very annoyed at the effects of their updates. Although, wouldn’t we have been angry if X_Problem remained un-touched and the adverse effects of X_Problem continued to negatively affect the game? With that mindset we’d be angry at Jagex either way - we can’t win nor can Jagex.</p>
<p>With that being said, I do disagree with Jagex in quite a fair few of their updates. I appreciate that they’re striving to perfect their game, but at what cost?</p>
<p>P.S. David I do not want to have a continued debate about policies, updates, etc. involving RuneScape, this is my view-point and I’m leaving it as such. I don’t want a heated debate like you had with Team Rocket. A party can express their beliefs without having to defend them, especially when we’re talking about something as trivial as RuneScape.</p>
