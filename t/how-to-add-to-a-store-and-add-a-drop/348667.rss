    <title>How to add to a store and add a drop?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-add-to-a-store-and-add-a-drop/348667</link>
    <description>I am using a 317.
I know that basically all servers are different but could someone tell me where I would find the file with the NPC store items. And where the NPC drops are?

I would like to be able to add some items to these two things for my players.
It would also be helpful if someone could include a example of a code if I need a large about of text in my coding.

public class NPCDrops {
   public int DropType;
   public int[] Items = new int[100];
   public int[] ItemsN = new int[100];
   public int npcId;

   public NPCDrops(int _npcId) {
      npcId = _npcId;
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; Items.length; i++) {
         Items = -1;
         ItemsN = 0;
      }
   }
}

What does this look like???</description>
