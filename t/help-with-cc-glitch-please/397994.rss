    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-cc-glitch-please/397994</link>
    <description>Okay, so in a server i play there&#39;s this glitch where it will automatically put you into the &quot;Market&quot; clan chat without you doing anything. You login on the server, and it automatically puts you into the &quot;Market&quot; clan chat, you cannot talk because it say&#39;s you&#39;re not in it, When you try to leave it says &quot;You&#39;re not in a clan&quot;, when you join it, everything everyone says is either double or more. The owner cannot figure out how to fix this, would someone please be able to help. 

Also, sometimes you get it where it says the same thing multipal times when you actually join the chat. 

This is what happens: [IMG]http://i54.tinypic.com/xerh4.png[/img]

Let me know if you can help, please and thanks.</description>

All it says is it auto makes you enter this cc. Anyway… Look for something in your log in method for clan chat shit. To find this type in your log in message to client.java via search box.</p>
