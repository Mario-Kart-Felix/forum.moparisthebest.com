    <title>My friend is having quite a few strange problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-friend-is-having-quite-a-few-strange-problems/253442</link>
    <description>First off, he can&#39;t run my server to host it, because he &quot;Doesn&#39;t have any Java&quot;.
He can compile it though, and he has the newest Javas. His CLASSPATH and Path variables are correct.

He can&#39;t run clients, because it tells him it can&#39;t find different parts of the client depending on the client (One can&#39;t find EGUI, another can&#39;t find client). These are all in their correct places.

Can anybody help?

Here&#39;s one picture. [img]http://i470.photobucket.com/albums/rr70/Bisaster/java.jpg[/img]</description>
