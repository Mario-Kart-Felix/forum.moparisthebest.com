    <title>Getting Full Range working... Any1 wanna help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-full-range-working-any1-wanna-help/194165</link>
    <description>Well I got skillcape emotes working for HBG-Scape V4 (yea, released V3 yesterday and am hard at work on V4 for you guys)
and have to say, the emotes I chose OWN lol...

Also added a firecape emote...

Changed smithing tab to emotes tab, you can still smith by using ::smith...

Adding a ::commands command for a list of ALL commands...

But now I need Full working Range...

That and changing around some teles and adding new pk areas, will be the work and V4 will ve ready, so HOW EXACTLY DO I GET RANGE WORKING?

I need either a tut or some1 helping me to make it hit from a distance, and I need to know where to add the gfx for each hit... thats all I have left really...

Already have a new home area chosen and designed....
Well jsut tell me how I get that to hit from a distance and were ready....</description>
