So that&#39;s a site I&#39;m working on, for a client.  I need pointers on the banner.  Something that would go with the smooth and simple theme.</description>

All you did was offer up some sort of idea, and then when he asked how that was supposed to fit the scheme, you just shrugged it off. As if he doesn’t have the intelligence to know how it might work. I personally don’t see how your idea would work at all.</p>

              <p>[quote=“ThAt0n36Uy, post:5, topic:193523”]Hmm… I guess I can help you out. Main thing is, it looks like a Monk commercial. Pristine white background, white coffee cup, with a perfect cup of Joe. Your best bet is to Use a coffee bean background, not to much, like a mound, getting taller as it reaches the middle, then have the white background behind it. You would then round the corners, not too much. Maybe a 6 px. That should be good enough, I don’t know, if you get around to making my idea, I can probably help from there.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>I changed my mind, this is what it needs to be. Dark brown, maybe a shade of milk chocolate, smoothly transitions into a lighter brown, like toffee. Toffee being the dominant color of the radial gradient. So maybe just hint at the sides with the dark milk chocolate. But it can’t be a bland toffee color throughout the entire thing, it still needs to be a gradient, so make it a straight dark to light. But stretch out the in between colors as much as you can. Then put the mound of coffee beans in front, making it so the highest point on the mound is in the dead center of the Gradient.[/quote]<br>
