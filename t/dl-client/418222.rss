              <p>So I have to change the link to the cache? How do I do that? And what do I change it to? But so this is what I have to do</p>
<p>1.) Change the link to the cache<br>
2.) Jar the client and the cache<br>
3.) Upload the jarred client and cache<br>
4.) People download and can play whenever I’m running the source.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>

              <p>That depends on what you mean by that.  If you want to jar it so they just download and run the jar, change the link the client gets the cache from and re-jar it.</p>
