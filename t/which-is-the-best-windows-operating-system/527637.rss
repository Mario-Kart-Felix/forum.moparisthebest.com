    <title>Which Is The Best Windows Operating System?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-is-the-best-windows-operating-system/527637</link>
    <description>Today, Microsoft has officially announced they are stopping support for Windows XP, however, they will keep the window for updates open for another year for small-medium businesses to make a switch-over to newer versions of Windows. I figured I would strike up a discussion about the various Windows operating systems, and hopefully others will throw in their piece of what they think.

It seems like Microsoft is on a roller-coaster with some of their products..

Windows XP - Amazing operating system, I personally grew up with Windows XP and I&#39;m using it right now. It&#39;s very simple, doesn&#39;t use many resources, and runs great. I have to say that I&#39;m somewhat &#39;sad&#39; that Microsoft stopped servicing Windows XP. Rest in peace to the best operating system, imo. 

With Windows XP going great for a long time, everyone was happy, except Microsoft, with everyone mostly already using Windows XP, and everyone pretty much already had it. Their profits were going down. So they figured they needed a new operating system to boost their profits. Which is when they invented a true piece of shit..

Windows Vista - I like to call Windows Vista, Microsoft&#39;s, &quot;quick&quot; project. It seems that they rushed to get it out, and it came out, but horrible. Though some like Windows Vista, I clearly, do not. The only plus that I can think of is that it would be pretty good to use on a media center PC. Aside from that, I find it worthless. It&#39;s also a resource hog, and lags on decent-specs computers. 

With Microsoft, very quickly, realizing people disliked (or rather, hated) Windows Vista, it seems like they rushed to get a new operating system out, which they did. And they came out with Windows XP&#39;s big brother.

Windows 7 - Windows 7 runs smooth and operates nicely. Using more resources than XP, however, not as much as Vista. It runs very nice and smooth. However, I personally don&#39;t think it&#39;s best for gaming. It seems that Microsoft is going in the direct that their customers want, and where the technology world is going. Everyone wants this slick, glossy, futuristic look to their products. Microsoft had some of this in Windows 7, but they seemed to get carried away with transparencies. 

After Microsoft decided to go more in-depth into the tablet world, that is what&#39;s big and exciting right now, they come out with a new product. A product that really really emphasizes the slick, glossy, and futuristic look that I mentioned earlier. 

Windows 8 - Windows Motherfudgein&#39; 8. Though it&#39;s great for tablets and phones, when they try to bring it to desktop computers, or even some laptops (that don&#39;t utilize a touch screen.) fudge you Microsoft, honestly. It&#39;s a great piece of software, for tablets, and mobile phones. Not desktops. It&#39;s very very easy and simple, and even my grandma who grew up with typewriters and has no technology experience can use it (she calls it a big remote of the web.) 

With my views on the past four Windows operating system&#39;s I honestly worry about what Microsoft is looking to unveil to us next. 

What do you think Windows 9 (or perhaps it&#39;ll be called, Windows Glossfudge,) will look like?</description>

<p>Though, there is 1 OS I’ve never gotten my hands on, and seriously want to try. Windows (Microsoft) Bob. It was a highly intelligent (for the time it came out) GUI based OS. It basically made the computer look like a house (or a room). And to access your desktop, you’d literally click on a desk.<br>

It was originally built as an OS, but I think people used it as an application.</p>

<p>I’m using a Windows 7 Premium (never understood the differences between these basic, premium etc. things) and I love it, and have almost no problems with some gaming (e.g. NeverWinter, SWTOR etc., I don’t play things like CounterStrike, Minecraft etc.).</p>
<p>I love Windows XP as that was the OS I grew up with, simple as that.</p>
<p>I’ve never tried Windows 8 on a computer but have used it a bit on a tablet (ex-girlfriend’s) and it was decent for a tablet I suppose but it would take some getting use to for me because of the slight differences between 7 and 8.</p>

<p>Who fed you that bull shit? It’s called progress. Of course Microsoft was going to come out with a new OS. Want in on a little secret? Windows 8 won’t be their last OS either. As technology advances and we have access to better hardware for cheaper, new operating systems will need to be developed in order to take advantage of the new technology. I mean, seriously, can you imagine running windows 3.1 right now? Get real dude. Of course they were going to make a new OS after XP, and hell, they didn’t for something like a 7 years…what more can you ask for? Over a decade of support, bug fixes and updates, that’s more than enough. All software eventually becomes obsolete, and expecting anyone to support obsolete software is just…ridiculous…To be honest, I’m more shocked that it took them this long, I personally would have scrapped Windows XP after releasing the first Windows 7 service pack. Also, let’s face it really…Windows XP wasn’t that great. It seems really good because Windows ME was a piece of shit, Windows 2000 seemed good by comparison, and then Windows XP was better than 2000. Today, it’s a piece of shit. Also, OF COURSE XP uses less resources than 7. 7 is designed to do more things on more hardware. Do you really think XP would have come out with Windows Aero and keep using the exact same amount of resources? This is of course ignoring the fact that they probably just couldn’t even do it at the time anyway.</p>

              <p>Hey guys, not to spoil the discussion, but this was to talk about Windows, not Linux. There’s a discussion on that and it should be kept separate…</p>
<p>Honestly, I like Windows 7 more than Windows 8.<br>
In order of how I like them:<br>
Windows 7<br>
Windows 8<br>
Windows XP<br>
Windows Vista<br>
Windows 2000 and before.</p>
<p>Though, there is 1 OS I’ve never gotten my hands on, and seriously want to try. Windows (Microsoft) Bob. It was a highly intelligent (for the time it came out) GUI based OS. It basically made the computer look like a house (or a room). And to access your desktop, you’d literally click on a desk.<br>
Here are some screenies:<br>

I’m staying with w7 for sure until it’s so ancient I can’t do shit with it anymore.<br>
Well I’m running Linux as well so I guess once w7 gets to outdated I’m going to stay Linux only if I didn’t already.<br>
w7 does everything I want why can’t I haz 7?</p>

<p>Windows XP:<br>
I can’t get too much into detail, it ran fine and everything, it just was that firstly I was pretty young, and secondly I got so many viruses on the computer so often that I had to reset it about once a month.</p>
<p>Windows 7:<br>
I love Windows 7, I’m using it right now, in fact. It looks nice. I’m not good with constructive criticism as far as games and specs and whatnot, but all the games that I love to play can be run(even on this laptop).</p>
<p>Windows 8:<br>
I had a Windows 8 PC for about 2 months. At first, I didn’t like it all that much, because it was hard to transition from 7 to 8 as they’re a bit different. But eventually, I downloaded enough add-ons that it appeared as Windows 7, from startup. One thing that I can remember from my PC is that it started up faster then most computers I’ve seen before then.</p>

<p>the only valid excuse to not using Linux is because you want to play games that only run on Windows or OSX. with SteamOS, hopefully that will all change and we will see some significant progress in gaming for Linux. i would love to see Windows and OSX gone from the sphere of computing and everyone using Linux.</p>
