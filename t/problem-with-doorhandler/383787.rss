    <title>Problem with doorhandler</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-doorhandler/383787</link>
    <description>I got a fairly empty source that i thought would be good to start my first good server, but it didn&#39;t come with a door handler. I borrowed the doorhandler.class and doorhandler.java files from another source i already had, added the appropriate codes into the server.java and client.java, tried to compile and i still have 1 last error that i can&#39;t seem to figure out...this is what my compiler says:
[code]Compiling.....
client.java:970: ReplaceObject(int,int,int,int) in client cannot be applied to (
int,int,int,int,int)
                                ReplaceObject(server.doorHandler.doorX[d],
                                ^
Note: stream.java uses or overrides a deprecated API.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for details.
1 error
Compiling Finished.
Press any key to continue . . .[/code]
