    <title>Buy 100 shop text option?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/buy-100-shop-text-option/294670</link>
    <description>Well i recently got tired of people on my server saying &quot;sell me arrows or runes because it will take too long buy hitting buy 10 at the shops&quot; so I fixed the by 10 option to make it buy 100 everytime you hit it. The problem is when u want to buy something at the shops it still says Buy 10 as an option. How do I fix it to say Buy 100?</description>
