    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-download/91405</link>
    <description>Ok, To start this off I am currently Using Ubuntu Linux and Mozille FireFox.Now since i cant use the desktop client i have to use the webclient.Ok whenever the WebCLient Starts downloading it gets to about 16-27% and the Window closes.Ive tried pretty much everything but i must not have tried everything cuz i havent gotten it working yet!If anyone knows how to fix this problem with the windows closing please tell me.

Thanks.</description>
