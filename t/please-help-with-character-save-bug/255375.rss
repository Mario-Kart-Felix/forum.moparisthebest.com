    <description>well, i use a very old source (jordiescape), that allows people to create chracters with the same name... how? idk...
as example:i create a char named bob and play at it for hours... then i log out, and one guy at another ip with a diferent password but the same character name can create bob too... that for sure will make a save in the bob file, who means if he only log in and out the bob character will back to level 3.
can someone help me to fix it?im thanks.</description>
