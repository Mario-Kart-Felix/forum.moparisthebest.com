    <title>Just an idea, not sure where to post</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/just-an-idea-not-sure-where-to-post/318155</link>
    <description>Right well, I&#39;m not 100% sure if this should be posted here, but I&#39;m sure someone can move it.
o.o

Well my little idea, or dream, whatever it should be called Is:

Would it be possible or easy to run a runescape private server with a Navicat database. It would serve as 
easier editing (after all files were converted) But seeing as I&#39;m brand new to making rs pservers. I&#39;ve got
no idea how everything is going about running itself (seeing as i found this website last night)...

It doesen&#39;t -seem- hard to do. But it would be very time consuming but in the long run
saving time.

I dunno, this is just a thought, not that I would dare to attempt it  O.o

Thanks for reading!
