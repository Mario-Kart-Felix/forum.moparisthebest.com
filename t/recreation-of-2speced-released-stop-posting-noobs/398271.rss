    <title>Recreation of 2Speced [RELEASED, STOP POSTING NOOBS!]</title>

    <description>http://www.youtube.com/runemtp &lt;- get an idea of the server with some of the pk videos.

OTHER VIDEOS:
[b]STAKING[/b] -&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55vvvGHNvfs
[b]Some Pking[/b] -&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPPHdASLzZs  &lt;- Please note that I lag horribly when I record so trying to pk and record may make the combat appear shitty but I can assure you that it isn&#39;t.

2Speced was a very popular server that was hosted several years ago. It was online for years. There were hundreds of people that played. It&#39;s main attraction was pking, although all skills worked. My goal is to recreate it.

So far most skills work. There are a couple small bugs but other than that everything is fine.

Also 2Speced used a client which was a .exe. I plan to try and make a webclient but if anyone knows how to turn the client into a .exe like they had done let me know.

[b]Please don&#39;t hate on this. 2Speced was my favorite server and I really want to recreate it. I feel a lot of people will enjoy playing this. If you have an idea for something I could add from 2Speced that you don&#39;t see please let me know, but please don&#39;t diss me or the server.[/b]

[b]Updates: Combat is basically complete. It is equal to or better than 2Speced&#39;s combat was. There will be pictures later. Credits for vain for helping out a lot. I haven&#39;t gotten too much done today with my power being out all day. Shops are also now in falador. They may not be in their exact spot but they are good.[/b]</description>

<p>EDIT: New video added, but I was extremely laggy when recording otherwise I would’ve done more clips.</p>

Good news everyone. The combat is now equal to or maybe even better than 2Speced! The only thing left to do is perfect the shops (make sure everything needed is in the shops) and make a webclient.</p>
<p>Hopefully I can make a delta webclient although i’ve never tried.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for vain for helping. Update pics soon, my power has been out all day and I’m at my friends atm.<br>
