<p>Disregard the faggots that are putting you down, they are just trying to make themselves look like better modelers when they themselves cant acknowledge their faults.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/faggots">@faggots</a> putting andrew down, im 100% sure you all started off pretty bad and you would have felt pretty low if people did nothing but flame your model and not even tell you what you could do to improve on it. If you get annoyed by seeing a bad model then dont come to this section anymore, people are going to post their work in order to have people critique it and get tips on improving their skills. Calling the model shit and being not worth criticism is a complete ignorant statement, it has room for improvement and thus should the errors on the model made apparent.</p>

Also i got quite alot of shit for posting bad models, so i stopped posting all the ones that were horrible.

<p>That input was not needed, we didn’t say shit to you because of your first models we tried to help you. We could have left you in a ditch and you would still have no skills in modelling whatsoever. Now if you think you can ditch other new people, doesn’t that make you the asshole? Fair game?[/quote]<br>
Oi mate, i try to help new comers it’s not my fault they think we don’t help. I’m in to help anyone where ever they need help, but if they go around saying no older modellers are helping then it’s not our fault. If you do the time you might aswell do the crime huh? Also i got quite alot of shit for posting bad models, so i stopped posting all the ones that were horrible. On the other hand, if he needs help improving his models he can ask any modeller and id be glad to help. If you don’t ask for it, you won’t get it.</p>

<p>Well he may be new, this may not be the best model. But digging him into the ground? And breaking his spirit is just fucking wrong. Take a break from trolling for just a few days please! I think quite a few people would agree, everyone started out making models like this and only thing he did was post it and you think that it’s right to be a faggot to him just because of that? Gawd he might go casey on you.</p>

This model isn’t worth saying whats wrong and right about it no offence. If you look on other models people do give CC and help people improve their models. If they choose not to realise what they are doing wrong and not fix it, its their fault.</p>
