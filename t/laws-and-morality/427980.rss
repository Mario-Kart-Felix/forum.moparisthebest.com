              <p>When you’re born into a country governed by a state you signed an unconditional contract (the social contract) in which you give up some of your freedom in order for the state to protect your civil liberties (such as stopping people from killing and stealing from you), so yes, I think that the law should enforce situations that breeches the rights of other people’s civil liberties, the fundamental problem is who decides what is and what is not moral, the Mayans sacrificed people to their gods and yet they felt it was necessary, by today’s standards it would be considered completely barbaric but to them it was ethical. And my answer to that, is that any action that directly influences someone else’s right to civil liberties (providing they’re part of the state) should be punished through legal enforcement (by the state).</p>

</aside>
<p>It all depends on perspective. Is a government that puts down some basic laws concerning safety in the workplace and traffic interfering with peoples rights, or is it just concerned about safety?</p>
<p>Besides, safety isn’t just a personal matter. If you are involved in a car crash, and you sustain brain damage because you didn’t wear safety belts, society is a victim too. Because of your brain damage, you won’t be able to work to your full potential, and you receive some form of social security. So the economy doesn’t benefit from you, the government doesn’t raise (as much) taxes, and the government has to pay you money. Nobody wins.</p>

<p>yes, the government SHOULD tell you how to protect yourself as it CAN be a burden on the general public as much as it is an issue of liberty</p>
<p>using your example of a motorcycle helmet, if you choose not to wear a helmet and get in a crash because of it, you not only have put yourself in danger you put other road users in danger too, but it goes deeper than that, even if the crash was not due to you not wearing a helmet, because you didn’t wear a helmet your chances of receiving a fatal injury significantly increase which puts a strain on hospitals and by proxy the general public and even the taxpayers should they be the one footing the bill[/quote]</p>
<p>My helmet analogy was just an example <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>BUT since you mentioned it . . . If you really become that injured as to create a public burden, you’re going to typically hurt more than your head, which any motorcyclist can do. (Usually, you’ll just die if you hurt your head that severely anyway.)</p>
<p>Again, it’s that balance of liberty vs. safety . . . Is it necessarily worth being made a law?</p>

              <p>Well in a sense at least a law is a rule/guideline that has to be followed. A moral is what we are taught to be the right thing to do in certain situations. So should they interfere with each other? Is one higher than the other? We are taught killing is wrong but there are those who still go out and murder. Does that mean they should be killed?</p>
<p>An eye for an eye? A tooth for a tooth? There is a justice system to make sure that the event really happened for a reason. I guess what I am saying is… in the extreme situations at least when a law and a moral have both been wronged then yes they can interfere.</p>

              <p>A government’s role should not be to enforce morality, but to effectively run a civilization within reason (these reasons are the very basic standards of living that have been accepted since the advent of society, such as <span class="bbcode-i">no killing</span> and <span class="bbcode-i">no stealing</span>). Additionally, I believe a government should enforce its rule of law.</p>
<p>However, if the government becomes too involved, moral decisions influence political decisions, which affects individuals differently. For example, many moral decisions involve safety, such as having to wear a helmet while riding a motorcycle. In this case, safety outweighs liberty, but should the government necessarily tell me how to protect myself? If I kill myself, that’s on <span class="bbcode-i">me</span>, not the general public.</p>

“<span class="bbcode-b">Laws should decide for the best of all the people</span>”<br>
This part is targeting murder, rape etc.<br>
By this: “people should keep their morality in private” I meant that if you opposes same-sex or opposite-sex marriage it is OK, but keep it in private and not make it law.</p>
<p>I don’t support majority morality, but I realize this is how it works. The United States are allowed to kill people with or without trial as much as they want because the majority of the people think it is OK.</p>

</aside>
<p>I might be unclear about what I meant, but if the law is really unjust you should of course fight against it (In reasonable terms). If you think a law is unjust because it isn’t within you sense of moral you can just fuck off.</p>
