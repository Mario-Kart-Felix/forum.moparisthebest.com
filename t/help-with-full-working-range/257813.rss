    <title>Help with full working range</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-full-working-range/257813</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve had the same problem for quite some time, and I&#39;ve searched for it, but so far haven&#39;t seen any solution. 

Does anyone know how to get range to work fully and properly?

All my range weapons work by strength bonus instead of range, which is fine i guess.

But more importantly, I can&#39;t get it so you shoot your ranged weapon from a distance. The character ALWAYS runs up to the target. It&#39;s hella annoying

Any help with this would be tight.</description>
