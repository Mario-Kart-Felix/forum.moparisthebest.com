              <p>That’s an interesting homepage there, I like it, however, the banner and theme used for forum itself does not fit with the homepage (it doesn’t always have to but is a lot more appealing) so I’d recommend do something about that. As for the banner itself though, I’d recommend using another one - that is honestly quite ugly, sorry.</p>
<p>The server looks interesting I suppose, that shoutbox is annoying though.</p>
<p>Good luck with the server though, I wish for the best!</p>
