    <title>[RESOLVED - N/A]Moparclassic rearrangement</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/resolved-n-a-moparclassic-rearrangement/530026</link>
    <description>I know what moparclassic is...but i am failing to see why it needs it&#39;s own actual board or even category for that matter. We have a &quot;mopar client&quot; that is only listed as a sticky somewhere. Yet, moparclassic gets it&#39;s own board really? I doubt it will be THAT active.(prove me wrong!)

I am suggesting that 

http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,267.0.html

this become a subboard of 

http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,119.0.html

If not adverts, maybe general rsc?</description>

<p>If the board actually got active and STAYED active I could see it having it’s own board but sadly I can already see in a year it will be dead again. Just like Moparcraft, just like gamedev, just like rs2007 has already become… a graveyard.</p>
<p>Give me a break at least I still am not going on about the female topic  :rolleyes:</p>

If you have a since of respect for these guys and their accomplishments you would know that a simple board at the bottom of the page is not a big issue.</p>
<p>As for the MoparRS2 server it’s perfectly capable of becoming a reality if you guys put your mind and free time towards it. Which Vain_ is correct, it would get its own board. If MoparClassic grows (which we are intending) we will move to <a href="http://classic.moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">classic.moparisthebest.com</a> or something of that nature but right now I don’t understand why you’re complaining.</p>

<p>moparclassic it’s a development of rscangel released by KO9 and rsca is based on the leaked rscdaemon.</p>
<p>the label of mopar was put on it and it became the community server, i guess it should have been like that for the rs2 so there is no need for efficient/paid server.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact now that I think about it somebody did do something like this now who was it…</p>
<p>By your logic also that’s like saying somebody like Mendorphins who made the tools package shoudl have his own board so people can “request” and “suggest” tools to go into the package. As the tool package had intentions of being supplied “for the community”</p>
