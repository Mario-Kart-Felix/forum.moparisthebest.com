    <title>Reliable 24/7 host, Fully Working SQRL, a great Source; all we need is YOU!</title>

    <description>We have a 24/7 host, fully setup and working SQRL, a great forum board, the original Dodian/Exorth source, all we need is a well-coded, working client and a developer who is dedicated and will stick around long enough to work out all the kinks and bugs. This position will grant you an owner spot on the server.

Before submitting an application please look over the requirements:

Skill &amp; Dedication
- must have worked with or created a 477+ client
- must have a good understanding of models and how to add and change them
- must be very dedicated and hard working

Client Needs
- loading 639 items and NPC&#39;s
- ability to easily change the name of items
- NO bugs or glitches
- full screen mode
- high detail (477+)

If you don&#39;t think meet one or more of the requirements above please do not submit an application. We are taking this very serious and do not want people whom are not capable.

To submit an application you must register on &lt;snip /&gt; and pm me a link to one or more projects you have worked on or started with proof that the project is yours. I will look over the project and make a list of people I think may actually have the ability to achieve what we want done. If you make the list you will have a one on one with Neosback in our IRC and he will make the ultimate decision.

I have also posted this on a number of other sites so there will be completion.

Thank you,
