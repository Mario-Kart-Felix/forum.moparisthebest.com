    <title>~~Clan War&#39;s Help~~</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/clan-wars-help/226111</link>
    <description>Okay, this post isnt the same as the last time I asked for help... because I&#39;ve figured some stuff out, I just don&#39;t know how to put it all together at the moment...
Okay so heres what I&#39;m doing, I&#39;m making a Clan Wars Minigame, but this one is not like the other Clan Wars that has a rip off of castle wars... No see I placed a portal in my Home area that leads you to the clan wars choosing site (you can choose two clans) so what I&#39;m trying to do is make a points system for each clan... now what I was thinking was that I could (when you go through the portal of your choice) you get either a ruby ring (red portal) or a sapphire ring (blue portal) and when you had that ring during the Clan Wars game, it would give points to your clan every time you killed someone from the other clan, but if you killed one of your own clan members, it would subtract points from your clan... So now all I need help with is...

-The game arena (how do I make the game realize that I&#39;m in clan wars)
-The scoring system (how do I make the game realize that I&#39;m in a certain clan, and when I kill another member it adds points to my clan)
-A time limit (A certain time until the game is over)
-A way to show who one and give all the members of that clan a reward fo winning

So if you can help me with any one of these I would really appreciate it.
