    <title>~~Clan War&#39;s Help~~</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/clan-wars-help/225412</link>
    <description>Okay, so I have the whole adding objects thing down, using public strings, int&#39;s, and other stuff like that,
and I&#39;m surprised I havent needed help until now, but what I&#39;m doing is making a Clan Wars minigame, but not like that stupid crap in other servers where all they did was &quot;re-code&quot; castle wars... No, I made a Clan Wars arena, I didn&#39;t feel like making/taking safezones, so I just threw it out into the wilderness. I boxed a huge section of the wilderness up to make an arena, then I added (am still adding) barriers for archers and mages.
So here&#39;s my problem... I have the portals set up in my home area (edgeville) and they each take you to a seperate part of the arena, and they each give you Zamorak/Saradomin attire... But, all that it currently does is just allow you to teleport to a blocked off section of the wilderness to battle another &quot;clan&quot; and there is no scoring system, no way to keep track of your clan&#39;s points (another thing I have to make) and when/if you win the &quot;match&quot; nothing happens... so I would like it very much if someone could tell me how/work with me/or just give the following things for my Clan Wars minigame -

(The list goes from Most Needed to Least Needed)

-Clan System (Create an official clan with your friends, and be able to give it points)
-Scoring/Winning System for Clan Wars (Gives points to the winners clan, and Will give them rewards)
-Time Limit for Clan Wars (I need a time limit to make the games short, also an alert system to let people know when the next game is starting)
-Player Limit/Just one clan limit (Right now, random people can just go through the portal and join any team that they want and there is no limit to how many people can join one team)
-Rewards for winning (I can probly do this myself, I just need a Scoring/Winning system)
-It would be cool if I could somehow create an upper level to my Clan Wars arena

~~Thats it for the list~~
I would really appreciate if someone would help me out, because once I finish this new Clan Wars system, I&#39;ll also be making other things to top the real Runescape, such as a Mod/Admin only minigame, maybe Mod/Admin wars (The same style as Clan Wars only with the restrictions of Mod/Admin only. Also I might add a new skill (probly not in this source though) and I might make an Assassin Minigame... but yeah I have a do-able ideas, so if you would like to help me please say so, if you have AIM that would totally help!



(Non-Related... Sorta)

I currently have (on my source)

-Two PkBoxes (one is just flat, and the other has archer/mage barriers)
-An Unfinished Clan wars
-A sucky Barrows minigame
-A fairly good Jad minigame
-Very helpful ::info and ::help commands
-A crashed attempted at a clan chat system (I used a tutorial and for some reason it didnt work...)
-A staff area
-Working prayer icons
-Godswords
-Sucky Godsword Mini (going to modify or rip it from client.java)
-And I&#39;m currently making new quests (after I finish Clan Wars)
---------------------------------------------------------------


So yeah, would someone please help, it would be much appreciated  ;D
