    <title>Could someone alter the Runescape logo for me?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/could-someone-alter-the-runescape-logo-for-me/470725</link>
    <description>Hey, I&#39;ve tried with what skills I have with GIMP (very little) to edit the Runescape banner, as I&#39;m creating a website for my server. If someone with more skills possibly change this for me? It&#39;ll be greatly appreciated and can be &#39;re-payed&#39; with and Website Development work or help.

I&#39;d like the, &#39;Runescape&#39; to say &#39;EclipseRuins&#39;

and the &#39;The World&#39;s Greatest Adventure&#39; to say &#39;Play Til&#39; You Drop&#39;

Thanks to anyone that can give me anything close to that!</description>
