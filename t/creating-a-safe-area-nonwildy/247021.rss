    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-a-safe-area-nonwildy/247021</link>
    <description>i Found a room i wanted to use for skillz and such but its in the wildy and i do not want players to kill each other here. So i have a pretty good idea on how to make this area non-wildy from digging through the forums but can some one explain it clearly i found this post :[quote=&quot;dixienormus1, post:4, topic:246950&quot;]Go into client.java and search nonwild something should come up and under there will be a whole bunch of points that look like this || (absX &gt;= 3237 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;=3247  &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 3512 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;=3247 ) || (absX &gt;= 3239 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 3247 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 3513 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;=3521 ) || this is just and example well at the end of one of them copy and past this   || (absX &gt;= xxx1 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;=xxx2  &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= yyy1 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;=yyy2 )


Now imagine you making a box around the island in xxx1 put the lowest x cord and in xxx2 put the highest x cord and in yyy1 put the lowst y cord and in yyy2 put the highest y cord hope this helped  :D[/quote] and i kinda understand it but when u go to nonwild in my client.java it and edited it to look like this:[code]                || (absX &gt;= 2992 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 3006 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 10340 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 10365)
[/code] but its still wildy Here are my 2 coords: [code]x: 3006 y: 10365,
x: 2992 y: 10340[/code]

              <p>well it dosen’t matter to me honestly which ever is easyest either way u would have to explain it to me…[br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 27, 2008, 08:11:49 pm[/size][hr]I Figured it out it has to do with the height <code>public boolean nonWild() {
        if ((absX &gt;= 3249 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 3258 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 3438 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 3431)
                || (absX &gt;= 2992 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 3010 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 3931 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 3966)
                || (absX &gt;= 2847 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 2874 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 9830 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 9854)
                || heightLevel == 1) {
</code><br>
so what exactly should i put where i want the height to b 0</p>

              <p>To make it easier then making every single area safe when you decide to make a new area, you can just make an inWilderness boolean, such as;</p>
<p><code>	public boolean inWilderness() {
		if (absX &gt;= 2940 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 3400 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 3524 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 3970 || absX &gt;= 2375 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 2418 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 5129 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 5167) {
			return true;
		}
		return false;
	}</code></p>
<p>By doing that, it would make the two coordinates inside the boolean (The full wilderness, and Fight pits) ‘Dangerous’. Although to get it to work, you would have to edit your attacking methods for this to work, which is quite simple.</p>
