    <title>State of Egypt (Middle East in general)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/state-of-egypt-middle-east-in-general/411070</link>
    <description>This is utter bullshit. Egypt just jumped from the fucking frying pan to the oven. I do not see this in any way working out for Egypt&#39;s good.

Here&#39;s an update on the state:

First we have a ruler that&#39;s been bleeding out the country for about 20 years (his first 10 or so years were not [i]that[/i] bad). Some people get the bright idea of starting a riot that quickly grows into a full scale revolution (because Mubarak used violence against the riots, even though there were fully authorized!). The revolution ends up dethroning Mubarak and people cheer each other up; but have we really won? 

The way I see it, Egypt is going to turn into a brainwashed country ruled by Muslim extremists, the kind that would kill for their Sheiks if they ask them to - and at the top of this all will be a few figures in control of the whole situation (ie. what used to happen with Mubarak). The military also has it&#39;s say in this; from what I see, the military is slowly trying to pick a side to &quot;support&quot; and abandon at the last moment when they no longer need their support. Then the Israeli attacks complicate matters; will we go to war? Is it going to be one of our choosing, or is it going to one that will be forced upon us?

Some past/current middle eastern secular leaders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosni mubarak</li>
<li>Saddam Hussain</li>
<li>Bashar al assad</li>
<li>Zine El Abidine Ben Ali (Watch this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm29ltigmOU" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm29ltigmOU</a> from 30 seconds onwards to see what this man hoarded)</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t even need to mention the characteristics of these leaders, most of you would have heard about them on the news.</p>
<p>On the otherhand, here are some islamist(Not islamic state) countries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saudi arabia</li>
<li>qatar</li>
<li>kuwait</li>
<li>United arab emirates</li>
<li>Bahrain</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I agree that these governments aren’t anywhere near perfect, but citizens of these countries are much more prosperous than those of their secular counterparts. See why fear of god - whether you yourself believe in him or not - keeps leaders in check?<br>
[/quote]<br>
If you are implying that Saudi Arabia is amazing then I would like you to think again. In Saudi Arabia women have no rights (can’t work, drive or even be in certain places without a man) as well as the fact that Islam is a forced religion there. if you force people to be muslims then they end up switching to Islam out of fear. This doesn’t stop them from committing crimes secretly however. It’s always better to do the right thing because you want to than to just hop on the bandwagon.[/quote]<br>
No I agree, Saudi isn’t an ideal society. But compare it’s citizens’ life to that of a regular Egyptian. The damage Mubarak done will take decades to be undone, whilst in Saudi the government does invest in it’s people.</p>
<p>[quote=“Frell, post:35, topic:411070”]Speaking of womens rights in the middle east, i’d like to bring up father-daughter acid attacks. Acid attacks in general are very common, and are almost always done on women, for marrying non-muslims or even going to school.</p>

If you are implying that Saudi Arabia is amazing then I would like you to think again. In Saudi Arabia women have no rights (can’t work, drive or even be in certain places without a man) as well as the fact that Islam is a forced religion there. if you force people to be muslims then they end up switching to Islam out of fear. This doesn’t stop them from committing crimes secretly however. It’s always better to do the right thing because you want to than to just hop on the bandwagon.</p>

<p>I’m not sure why the government agreed to add it, but when they finally caved in to the campaign that was calling for it to be added, they said Lincoln once said it in one of his speeches, and they liked it. Or something like that, I can’t really remember and can’t be bothered researching on a topic that is probably largely contested across the interwebs.</p>

<p>The Muslim brotherhood is a group of hypocrites who keep changing their views everyday. Actually there was an incident where they had two representatives speaking different views on two different channels.<br>

Do you have a source for this?</p>
<p>[quote author=tL link=topic=512339.msg3719321#msg3719321 date=1313835923]<br>
The fact a religious organisation could gain significant political force? I assume, at least. Just because ytuio is a muslim, I don’t think it necessarily means he would want the country run by an organisation based on religion.<br>
[/quote]Do you know of a single secular government in the region which isn’t corrupt? It’s easy to understand why people are longing for a religious government.[/quote]<br>
Other than the fact I saw it on TV, I can’t provide a source. Also the religious forces in Egypt are operating on the peoples’ ignorance. People don’t understand that going on terrorist bombings will actually hurt or will not improve the country and therefore they do it with impunity. The sad thing is this is probably where the country is headed and the religious groups will win, and imo. they will start fucking up starting then and we will have a new revolution</p>
