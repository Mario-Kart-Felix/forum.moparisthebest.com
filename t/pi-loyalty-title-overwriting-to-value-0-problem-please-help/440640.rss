    <description>Hello rune-server

I keep having this problem where when i log out of my server, it will save my character, but it autosaves over the loyalty title, so if i go into char files, make my character title = 3 and then save it and log in, it has title 3, then if i log out, and go to char file it has title = 0, and then if i log back in it has title = 0 so theres no title or whatever title 0 is.

Please help with this problem thanx.

Here are my files u can look at to see if there is anything causing this.

[URL=http://&quot;http://up.ht/IdfSd3&quot;]http://up.ht/IdfSd3[/URL] - (Client.java client sided) - hybrid pvpscape client i think.
[URL=http://&quot;http://up.ht/Idg9fS&quot;]http://up.ht/Idg9fS[/URL] - (Player.java from server files) - i think it was insanityX at one time not sure.
[URL=http://&quot;http://up.ht/IdglvT&quot;]http://up.ht/IdglvT[/URL] - (Playersave.java from server files)

I&#39;ve followed both of these tutourials to get the titles on my characters, and in the chatbox.

Tut 1 = [URL=http://&quot;http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-server/snippets/350858-adding-all-loyalty-titles.html&quot;]http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-server/snippets/350858-adding-all-loyalty-titles.html[/URL]

Tut 2 = [URL=http://&quot;http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-client/snippets/368755-loyalty-titles-chatbox-colour.html&quot;]http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-client/snippets/368755-loyalty-titles-chatbox-colour.html[/URL]

Please/thankyou, any help is appreciated, have a nice day.

Matt
