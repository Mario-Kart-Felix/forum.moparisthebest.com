    <description>im making my own custom grand exchange and need to know how to make the ::sell command and ::buy command ::gesales

i want it to be like ::sell (the item id thats in ur inventory) (the quanity)

and have it so when u sell the item it says in the below chatbox for all players to here that (there username) has sold (the item) on the grand exchange!

then for the ::gesales

to show like those quest scroll things on the screen and showing what items people are selling

and for the ::buy command where you type ::buy (the item ID) (quanity)
then the item goes in ur inventory and the money goes to the person who sold it when they type ::collect

if anyone can tell me how to make any of those commands please tell me!</description>

              <p>Making a Grand Exchange is a fairly complicated process, just to let you know. I’m not going to provide you with the complete code, but I’ll give you an outline of what you will have to do.</p>
<p>For one, you would need some way to hold all of the information. A database would work best, but you could hold it in an ArrayList or something and then send it to a file (not very efficient).</p>
<p>For your sell command, you could separate the numbers using the split method or by making two separate Strings by using the subString method. Then you would have to check if the player has the necessary item and quantity as specified in the command: if he/she does, then add it to the Grand Exchange item list and remove the item(s) from the player’s inventory. If not, then send a message saying that they don’t have that item or enough of the item, and don’t add it to the Grand Exchange.</p>
<p>For the buy method, you would have to break down the item ID and quantity as I specified in the first part, then check if the player has the necessary amount of cash and that there is enough of that item available in the G.E. Then you would have to remove it from the Grand Exchange and give it to the player, etc.</p>
<p>That’s the basics, but there is MUCH more to it.</p>
