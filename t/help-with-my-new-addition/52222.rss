    <description>[code]
case 24135: //Duel Mode On
{
inwildy = true;
sendMessage(&quot;Duel Mode on, its like the wilderness anywhere!&quot;);
sendMessage(&quot;Remember, you can only attack others in the wild or that also have duel mode on!&quot;);
PlayerHandler.messageToAll = playerName + &quot; has activated duel mode! Hooray!&quot;;


outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
outStream.writeByteC(3);        // command slot (does it matter which one?)
outStream.writeByteA(1);        // 0 or 1; 1 if command should be placed on top in context menu
outStream.writeString(&quot;Attack&quot;);
outStream.endFrameVarSize();
break;
}
case 24134: // Duel Mode Off
{
inwildy = false;
sendMessage(&quot;Duel Mode has been turned off...&quot;);
sendMessage(&quot;Phew, that was close, huh?&quot;);
PlayerHandler.messageToAll = playerName + &quot; has turned off duel mode. Boo!&quot;;
break;
}
[/code]

The idea was to make it so if the option was set to &quot;On&quot;, you could attack people in the wilderness from outside OR to attack other people with the setting to &quot;On&quot;. How would I make it so that other people can attack eachother if the option is set?</description>
