    <description>well im training my combat skillz now. i have 79 att, 80 str, 79 def, 80 range, 79 mage. im getting my att and def to 80 and str to 81 on blue drags. then selling bones and buying supplies for mage to go train mage. i want to get a chance at the draconic visage, so i wanna kill skeletal wyvren, or steel/iron dragons. i need to know which is better.

and i need a really good spot to use my cannon. preferrably killing high lvls so i can train other combat skills too. and obviously multi-combat. i am training on lunar island right now, but i dont like it, but its pretty good xp.

and i was wondering if any of you have used starblaster100&#39;s ess mining script. i wanna know if its worth 1m, if anyone has gotten banned/caught. and all those kinds of things. i want to use it on my main because i need p ess and that my only member account. and i want to rc. if i buy it, of course iim gonna test it by using it for multiple hours on a non-members account, during the day and at night. and see what happens with that.</description>
