Open your cmd by going to Start &gt; Run &gt; cmd.
Type in `ipconfig´
It will say your default gateway, so type that in your browser and you will get a login screen.
Skip the username part and fill in  `admin´ at the password field.
Click the Applications &amp; Gaming tab and fill in the things.
Start &amp; End = 43594
