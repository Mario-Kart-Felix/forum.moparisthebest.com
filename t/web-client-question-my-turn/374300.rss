    <title>Web client question - my turn</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/web-client-question-my-turn/374300</link>
    <description>Using a basically blank non-refactored deob, figured out some problems to why it wasn&#39;t loading, now I keep getting &quot;Requesting title screen&quot;, then it says &quot;Connection error&quot;, now before you client experts say &quot;Change the sprites directory&quot; - I already have, it all loads perfectly fine as .jar, and just by batch / Client, when I load it onto a web page, it fails to load, anyone know why? I replaced my class44 with one from my old client, and still the same error.</description>
