    <title>World Storage</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/world-storage/418030</link>
    <description>This is just an idea I had that (I believe) would be a nice addition to the game.

What I&#39;m thinking is online storage of the different (single player) worlds. This would of course be a feature only available for subscribers. All the world data would stored in Notch&#39;s basement or something similar.

When you select the Single Player mode, the client requests a list of all the worlds, bound to the current account. At which point the server (used for world storage) would send the world data to the client. Now, the user could choose to import the world data, so that it is saved directly to the local machine (for offline playing) and then next time the client connects, it would send the changes to the world storage server (if the user wanted to).

Now, there may be a slight issue with lag. My proposition to fix this would be when the player selects the world they would like to play, the server sends only basic map data (player position and map seed). At which point the client would generate the world normally. Then, the client would request all changes made to the &quot;default&quot; world, reducing the amount of bandwidth usage.

Does anyone else think this is a good idea? If you need further explaining on some of the finer details i would be more than happy to elaborate.</description>

<p>Notch could barely handle the authentication requests, I’d like to see him run a world-loading server. You’d just get a load of people saying HELP NOTCH I CANT LOAD WORLDS I PAY 30 EURO FOR THIS AND U HOST SERVER IN BASEMENT</p>

<p>Not really sure what that is. I know what cloud storage is, but what’s the passive classification?</p>

<p>Yes, that’s something that I lost the words to in my mind. Basically, after you logged in and went to the single player menu, it would request all the worlds that you have stored off-site. Then, you would download the world data to the local machine (temporarily). Then (either periodically or when you exit) the changes would be sent to the server. Not the entire map itself, just the changes made to the map.</p>
