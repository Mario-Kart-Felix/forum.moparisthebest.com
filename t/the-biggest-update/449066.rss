    <title>The BIGGEST Update</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-biggest-update/449066</link>
    <description>Currently, I do not play RuneScape right now. I used to love the game with a passion, but times have changed I guess. I started playing other games only to realize that when you compare them to RS, they all seem to be easier and self gratifying at the same time. Don&#39;t get me wrong though, it is a great feeling to get a long term achievement in RuneScape, such as level 138, but that literally takes a good bit of your life away.

Anyways... in relativity to the thread subject, I will say that I will probably be coming back to RS. Sure, things might only be different because of the techniques of fighting, training and pking. Experience rates and other achievements will most likely be the same. A lot of people despise this update because it is changing the way everything works in the game, but we have to learn to stop reminiscing the game we started playing it. I&#39;m not going to lie; there were some pretty amazing times that I had in the early moments of RS, but I can almost guarantee that everyone will enjoy the new RS more than any previous versions.

I want to hear your opinion on this, so please, discuss.</description>

<p>Honestly, I can’t tell if that was sarcasm.  But I meant in general they’re making the game easier, not for combat.  Like firemaking is so easy now because you just add logs and do whatever you want for a minute while your inventory empties.  You don’t need runes, or even magic anymore to teleport with lodestones.  Runespan makes runecrafting a nearly completely AFK skill, etc.[/quote]I don’t know about you but for example the firemaking, I would rather quicker ways to level my firemaking than just sitting on my ass for days on end pressing a log and a tinderbox… They added bonfires - I actually believe it adds more interaction into the skill… I mean I would rather talk to people who are training the same skill instead of just leveling the boring thing myself. There’s nothing fun about grinding and even more so - there’s nothing fun about grinding with no interaction of other players at all… and that’s why RS is trying to make their skills quicker and slightly different.</p>

Runespan was a good thing though, it will push rune prices up and make it profitable to rc the traditional way. As for Firemaking it doesn’t really matter since the skill is useless.</p>

The update actually doesn’t look too bad in my opinion. I still won’t be playing, however. RuneScape’s player base is too young and arrogant (or so it seems like) for me. Back in the old days the player base was mature and people were enjoyable to hang around. I also don’t really like the idea of selling in-game items on cards at GameStop/EBGames.</p>
<p>But, everyone has to understand that the MMO scene is evolving and without updates RuneScape would be a bland and tasteless game. If they kept it the 2006 era forever, everyone probably would’ve quit from boredom (I know I would)! The combat update is to combat with the other MMO’s, because lets face it, RuneScape’s current combat looks stupid and a flash game could have better-looking combat.<br>
[/quote]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">But it’s unique. No other game has similar combat.</span>[/quote]<br>
Thats true</p>
<p>But I personally liked the update, but I lagged too much fps wise to actually enjoy it  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

              <p>I really hate those RS players that live in the past and say stupid remarks like ‘BRING BACK OLD RS BLABLABLA’… You guys need to wake up and realize as technology becomes more advanced, so does the game… I don’t play the game anymore… But I do watch a lot of RS videos and I am amazed at how far the game has come… and so what if they make the game more challenging? WHO THE FUCK CARES? At least it makes the 12YR old kids more clueless and the mature players more of a challenge … Everyone needs to stop living in the damn past and MOVE THE FUCK ON.</p>

              <p>Currently, I do not play RuneScape right now. I used to love the game with a passion, but times have changed I guess. I started playing other games only to realize that when you compare them to RS, they all seem to be easier and self gratifying at the same time. Don’t get me wrong though, it is a great feeling to get a long term achievement in RuneScape, such as level 138, but that literally takes a good bit of your life away.</p>
<p>Anyways… in relativity to the thread subject, I will say that I will probably be coming back to RS. Sure, things might only be different because of the techniques of fighting, training and pking. Experience rates and other achievements will most likely be the same. A lot of people despise this update because it is changing the way everything works in the game, but we have to learn to stop reminiscing the game we started playing it. I’m not going to lie; there were some pretty amazing times that I had in the early moments of RS, but I can almost guarantee that everyone will enjoy the new RS more than any previous versions.</p>
<p>I want to hear your opinion on this, so please, discuss.</p>
