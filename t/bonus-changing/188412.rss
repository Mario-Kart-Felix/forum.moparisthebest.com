    <description>Hey, 

On my server, i beleive it was origianally (sorry for that spelling) Dodian.

So what i wanted to askw as how to make the bonuses stay at 0 no matter your levels, because if you have over level 80 of something, or something like that it gives you some bonuses, so if i have all level 99 skills i get bonuses of 9 on all attack bonuses, 19 on defence bonuses and 19 on strength.

Please help?

-- Thanks --</description>
