    <description>Or does it even have a relation? How would I make something made in Swing update whenever someone does something?</description>

              <p>AWT might be stone age (if 10 years ago is considered an age ago :P), but it’s still useful.  And basically all swing components, such as JFrame and JComponent, extend on awt components, Frame and Container/Component respectively.</p>
<p>paint() is called, even in swing, to “refresh” heavyweight components.  repaint() and update() can therefore be called in mostly any gui component, swing or awt, to “refresh” it.  I don’t believe it repaints subcomponents though, but to be honest I’m not entirely sure, which is my reasoning for not going into an in depth explanation.  Here’s a good article that might answer some of your questions though: <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/articles/painting/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/articles/painting/</a></p>

              <p>Yeah, I know about action listeners. I guess I kind of asked the question wrong. For example in the Runescape client in Frame_Sub_1 there’s paint(Graphics g), but that’s implementing AWT (stone age). I was wondering if paint() has any relevancy at all to Swing.

              <p>Swing does have a relation to Graphics (since it implements the awt package), but I believe what you’re talking about is event listening…as in, if the user clicks a button then perform a certain action, right?</p>
<p>If so, I’d read up on exactly that: <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/events/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/events/index.html</a></p>
