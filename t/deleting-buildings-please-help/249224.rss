    <title>Deleting buildings (Please Help)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/deleting-buildings-please-help/249224</link>
    <description>Okay so i want to remove a few buildings and add some. Yes, i have used the search engine and the deleteglobalobject() comand is not working. I want to delete the buildings (say im redoing varrok) in a way that the actual building is not in the script, and it doesint have to load (delete instead of using the deleteglobalobject command). Is there a .java file or a .class file i could decompile that has all of the building codes inside it? Please help ive been looking for 3months and cannot find a answer. Also, how could i add a building. Thank you verry much :)</description>
