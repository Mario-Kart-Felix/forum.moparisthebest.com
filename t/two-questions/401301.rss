Well if your using <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Project Insanity</span></span> you could handle your Npc dialouge like this;</p>
<p>[code]  private static void getRandomMessage(Client c) {<br>
int message = Misc.random(22-1);<br>
String[][] messages = {<br>
{“It’s a rather beautiful day isn’t it?”},<br>
{“I’m just your average villager.”},<br>
{“Sorry do I know you?”},<br>
{“You can train throughout the world of RuneScape.”},<br>

                    {"I Loved my son.... he was a good fella..."},

                    {"I'm sorry sir I can't help you today I'm extremley busy.."},

                    {"Best be off!"},
                    {"RuneScape, the leading game."},
                    {"Sorry do I know you?"},
                    {"You can train throughout the world of RuneScape."},
                    {"I'm sorry sir I can't help you today I'm extremley busy.."},

            };
            sendNpcChat(c, messages[message][0],  c.talkingNpc, ""+Server.npcHandler.getNpcListName(c.talkingNpc)+"");
    }[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>And what that is, is every NPC you talk to it will randomise the dialogue, it’s not accurate and needs some work, but it’s still pretty good and simplistic. I’ve made it so all the NPC’S that are ‘talk able’ will that randomised, you can change this by;<br>
<span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">c.talkingNpc, “”+Server.npcHandler.getNpcListName(c.talkingNpc)+"</span></span>. It’s also better then making a case for each dialogue you want to make.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>He would still have a problem. If he codes all the dialogues into the server, he will still reach the 64KB max length for a method.</p>
<p>What I would suggest is creating a file that holds dialogues, then loading them at startup.[/quote]</p>
<p>True, though I was just telling him how he could make his life easier by making his dialogue like that.</p>
