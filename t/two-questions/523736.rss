    <title>Two questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/two-questions/523736</link>
    <description>1. Let&#39;s say I was out taking photos and when I returned home, I found that there was a reflection of a woman getting undressed in a window. Not through the window, just the reflection. What could I do to that reflection to see what it would properly look like if the photo had been taken directly?

2. Say if I was airbrushing skin and after all the blurring and spot removal, I added too much noise. Actually, any noise seems too much but the blur looks too plastic and the skin doesn&#39;t improve much if the blur isn&#39;t set at that level. How would I solve this?

Photoshop is one of the few things that I admit I&#39;m useless at. Trying to pick it up has been fun so far.
Just two odd questions, thanks.</description>

I’m just not sure how to tackle it, especially the first. Changing the contrast helps a little but not so it’s crystal clear.</p>
