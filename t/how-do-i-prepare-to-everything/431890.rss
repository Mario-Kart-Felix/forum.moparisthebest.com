    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-prepare-to-everything/431890</link>
    <description>Hello, im new here, since i pissed of leeching rsps servers and clients,adding code that i dont know even how it works etc, i really need help there, couse i want create something from basic my questions:

How to prepare yourself (mind) for java programming?
I know that most of you using eclipse ide how do i setup it for any rsps base?
What base i should choose for beggining,i have choosed pi, but since theres many tutorials, i dont want to use any created source copy/paste , i want create them self?
How to create yourself code ,like skills,following etc compatible with client.
How everythings works in rsps i mean how to make everything from scratch? please picture tutorial , my english is terrible and im to dumb to think logically
Is there any commands library like in other programming languages?
[b]Is there any lithuanians in this community? java in lithuanian language would be useful[/b]

short things about me:
i have never used any programming language, i just read that things exist like ,C# ,C++ ,pascal ,Vb net?,php,html
things what i want to create: 474 server with client ,also working mysql loging, even dont know how to use lol


Things i have done ,installed jdk 7,jre 7, setup enviroment variables for javac,downloaded and installed eclipse ide.

Things i want to learn: how to use database (mysql) with server,start scripting from scratch , create following system ,talking npcs , i will dedicate my years for coding, if you help , dont post bullshit how to use google, theres too much info for me i dont know what should i pick , let me know what should i choose. 


appreciate any reply..

regards,

forum mate.
