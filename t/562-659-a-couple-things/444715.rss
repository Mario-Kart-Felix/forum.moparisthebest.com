    <description>1) How do I add a Point System
Basically what I want it to do is, when I kill a NPC, it will give me a certain amount of points, which I could use these points on a special shop.

2) Fulling Inventory?
Basically want I am asking is, when I click on, buy 50, it says, not enough inventory space.
How do I make it so when I click the 50, it will just fill my inventory.

3)Adding Fishing
So I put my fishing spots in the place I want them to be, when I click on them it will say something like, You need a harpoon to fish here.
I will get a harpoon, but then nothing will happen when I click on the fishing spot again.
How do I make it so it will give me the fish and Xp.

4) Adding a custom Dungeoneering Mini-game
What i wanted was to have certain NPC&#39;s that I can kill, so that when I kill them I will get dungeoneering xp, and dungeoneering points.

5)Items Wielding Wrong
so ive been adding different items and for some reason a one handed weapons will be wielded as a two handed weapon. How do i make it one handed like it should?

sorry if these questions are very &quot;noobish&quot;
I am fairly new to coding and I am trying to get all the help I could get.</description>
