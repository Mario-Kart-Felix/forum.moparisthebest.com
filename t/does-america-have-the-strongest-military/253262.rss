<p>How does Iraq have a strong military? Are you talking about Saddam Hussein’s days? Even then, they don’t even compare to Russia. Also, Russia is obviously much more superior than Iran in terms of military capabilities.</p>

<p>Thats an ignorantly opinionated statement. There is no best force, each force has its own specialty.</p>
<p>In all reality, the debate about the ‘SAS is so awesome’ is dumb. The US and Britian have exchanged exercises and practices between the S.A.S. and SEALs, the majority of what the SAS knows, the SEAL’s do also (and vice versa). It would most likely be a 50/50 fight if such a thing happened.</p>
<p>I don’t just jump into a military debate thread and say that the SEALs would own everyone they’re so talented and no one stands a chance. A couple people have done that here, however.<br>
[/quote]<br>
No they haven’t you moron. The SAS has <em>never</em> trained with other forces than other branches of Special Air Service. i.e the SASR, SAS, FSASR.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Yes, they have. The nations exchange this sort of stuff as a camaraderie, we HAVE sent people to train witht he SAS, they SAS HAS sent people to train with the seals.[/quote]<br>
Where are you pulling this shit from? Are you confused with British Marine Corp? The SAS has never cross trained, other than the branches of itself. Even then, the British Special Air Service has only ever trained with the Special Air Service Regiment of Australia. I don’t think you understand how elite the S.A.S is - they are the epitome of services. The “Navy SEALs”, while excellent counter-terrorism servicemen, do not even compare to them.</p>
<p>If the Navy SEALs were to rage war against the Special Air Service in guerilla warfare, the Special Air Service would make the SEALs look like fools. But if they were doing some form of counter-terrorism boarding of an illegal oil-rig, enemy warship, the Navy SEALs would be in their element.</p>
<p>However, it’s stupid you start to compare the two services. They both wouldn’t ever confront each other, one specializes in force projection from the sea (Marines), one specializes in special reconnaissance missions, and the other is trained in every aspect of warfare, from sniper, survivalist, navigator, hand to hand and the list goes on. Bottom line is, you cannot compare the two.</p>

              <p>I believe I’ve said this before, but I’ll say it again. The strength of an army is relative to the enemy. The US defeated the Iraqi army easily, but it can’t defeat some farmers riding donkey’s. You can spend a load on technology, but in guerrilla warfare you can’t use it because the enemy blends in. Nazi Germany had a decent solution for that, but the US can’t do that.</p>
