<p>Your right, I do defend them because I am a muslim. But nevertheless, I still believe hamas is doing what it should be doing. Even when the rockets do hit civilians, I believe Hamas isn’t accountable. That is because the land belongs to them, and if they decide to fire rockets there, they have the right to. It’s only the illegal organization called ‘israel’ that allowed people to live on stolen land, so Israel is more truly responsible for what happens to the civilians.</p>

[/quote]</p>
<p>It isn’t truly legitimate, but I can understand why they do it. European Jews invaded Arabic land, and called their home. They pushed the Palestinians out of their country.</p>
<p>Retaliating is just as bad as the initial attacks, but the Israelis use phosphorous (did I spell that right now?). It’s almost as bad as using napalm on a city. It doesn’t care what it burns. Not all Palestinians are ‘terrorists’, and not all Palestinians support Hamas, but they get hurt nonetheless.[/quote]</p>
<p>i never said anything about all palestinians are this or that. I resent the accusation.</p>
<p>Also, you may be intrested to know that hamas won the free and fair elections in Gaza, so at least 50% of palestinians in Gaza support hamas.</p>
<p>(makes you wonder why America says it wants to spread democracy to the middle east… it seems to be already there)</p>
<p>As for the invasion by European jews, according to the jewish religion, that was their original home over 2000 years ago from which they were driven out of. Now they are returning.<br>
of course, if you follow islam you will ‘know’ that the jewish religion is all wrong.</p>
<p>also, when Isreal was founded by the United Nations, there was a palastinian state founded as well, of roughly equal size.<br>
However, it seems the Arabs were <span class="bbcode-i">unwilling to accept compromise</span>, and so the first Arab-Isreali war started, finishing with victory for the Isrealites.</p>
<p>as for phosphor, its not simply a spelling mistake, but took on a whole new meaning, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphor" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">phosphor</a> is completely different to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_phosphorus" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">white phosporus</a></p>

<p>You are an Atheist too. You know that the bible, or Tanakh in this case, isn’t a reliable source for anything. Besides that, it’s over 2000 years ago. If the right to ‘create’ your own land is history, the world would be even uglier. I’m Frisian, we used to have our own nation. It was quite big on it’s peak, stretching to Belgium. But do we care now? Do we want to claim it our own again? Do we want to kill thousands of innocents for it?</p>

<p>The European Jews are complete strangers in the area. If the conflict would be between Arab-Muslims and Arab-Jews, I’d understand the Jews. But the Jews come from Europe, with a completely different culture. Lets say Muslims would come to England and establish their own nation there. What would the English do? Just accept them? I know it sounds quite far fetched, but what if the US, or China/any superpower supported them? Would they shrug and go on with their lives?</p>

<p>It’s more a translation mistake. The Dutch word for phosphorous is ‘fosfor’, so that mistake is easily made.</p>

<p>That example is hardly similar. Don’t forget that these jews migrated to muslim land, evicted tens of thousands, killed tens of thousands, displaced over a million people and claimed it their own country. The qassam rockets are hardly dangerous, even when they do hit civilians, they only rarely kill people. You can’t really compare Israel’s retaliations to the Palestinian resistance, Israel is ruthlessly willing to kill innocent men, women and children.</p>
<p>Ask yourself this, If hamas had Israel’s military capability, would Israeli children be dieing in the hundreds? Don’t the people who were evicted from their land have the right to fight back for it? Is the establishment of the Israeli state justified because of rumors that say these people lived there 2000 years ago?</p>
<p>Imagine this scenario. A Jewish family comes to live in your house because apparently, 6 million Jews were murdered back where they used to live. A week later they kick you out of your house and force you to live in a small corner in your backyard, claiming that their ancestors lived here 2000 years ago. Another week later and they surround you with concrete walls and don’t even allow food to pass through. America is arming them with the best weapons, which they then use to slaughter your family. You throw rocks back at your house and they call you a terrorist.</p>

<p>You are an Atheist too. You know that the bible, or Tanakh in this case, isn’t a reliable source for anything. Besides that, it’s over 2000 years ago. If the right to ‘create’ your own land is history, the world would be even uglier. I’m Frisian, we used to have our own nation. It was quite big on it’s peak, stretching to Belgium. But do we care now? Do we want to claim it our own again? Do we want to kill thousands of innocents for it?</p>

<p>my atheism has nothing to do with it.<br>
I know that the bible isnt a reliable source, in the same way that many people who support Isreal know that it is the word of god.</p>

<p>That example is hardly similar. Don’t forget that these jews migrated to muslim land, evicted tens of thousands, killed tens of thousands, displaced over a million people and claimed it their own country. The qassam rockets are hardly dangerous, even when they do hit civilians, they only rarely kill people. You can’t really compare Israel’s retaliations to the Palestinian resistance, Israel is ruthlessly willing to kill innocent men, women and children.</p>

<p>Yes, both religions contradict each other. But if you were to look at it neutrally, ignoring both religions, it’s clear that land belongs to the Palestinians. Historically, Arabs were there before the jews, and many of the Palestinians who were evicted from Palestine are still alive today.</p>

<p>Muslims are always a bit more extreme. We Westerns don’t understand it. Muslims have the same ideas as Christians did during the crusades. Killing in the name of their religion isn’t considered a bad thing. To us it is, but they think things we do is unacceptable.</p>

<p>This is true. And this also shows they aren’t open to reason. They don’t act as civilized people.</p>
<p>Another problem is that there are several splinter groups. Hamas and Israel come to an agreement, but splinter groups, who don’t like the agreement, attack Israel. Which leads to retaliation attacks from Israel, and the agreement is gone.</p>

<p>It wasn’t as simple as that, the war had been going on for a few years, it was almost over and Japan refused to surrender, the US didn’t just ‘drop it’, they warned them and told them that severe devastation would fall onto their country if they did not stop, they didnt. Theeeennn they dropped them. Yes it was wrong, but many more people were saved, including soldiers and civilians.</p>
<p>Not to mention, the US went over to japan and created bases and helped to rebuild, we didn’t just leave it like that, which is what Hitler did.<br>

it was an overly harsh act regardless of what the yanks did afterwards. However no country has not done something stupid like this, not on such a scale as america but still.

<p>Japan was basically mobilizing their whole population to war. You’re not seeing what COULD have happened if America didn’t drop those two bombs. Japan stuck to their war code and was ready to fight until everybody was dead.</p>
<p>200,000 dead or millions dead.</p>
<p>It might be harsh, but it had to be done.</p>

Another reason [not sure if it was mentioned in this thread] for the bomb drops was for the US to showcase it’s new weapon to try and halt Soviet expansion, especially into Asia. [Of course, this failed, and the Soviets had their own bomb test a few years later.] To the US, who wrongly considered Soviets and Soviet communism to be “horrible”, it was pretty necessary.</p>

Like Soviet Union and US got after WWII.<br>
But the world is different now, there has been no war in West-Europe since 1945 or in US.<br>
And there is less to earn on a war now than it was before.<br>
So if US and UK fight about something, war would not be a good solution.</p>
