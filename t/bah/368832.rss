    <description>So yea.. Went go get Sky+HD Multiroom


Sky came out and because there is a huge trench underneith our current sky dish they cannot get to it for &quot;Safety reasons&quot;

So they turned round and said, We&#39;ll leave ALL the stuff needed to set up a new dish on the roof.. Just get someone to come out and fit it.

Must have rang about 8 companies in my immediate area and they all want a minimum of £70 -.-


Meanwhile Sky have started charging us for Multiroom as they have left the box.</description>

<p>Looks like its just a case of adding the connectors on and putting the wire through the wall and screwing it into the LNB on the satalite… Doesnt look a hard job at all.<br>
Just need to find someone with a long enough ladder haha</p>

              <p>There’s lots of legitimate ways for people to get content these days, especially if you considered paying that kinda money for even just installation.</p>
<p>And yes, pirating could be your form of boycotting this crap, but it could also augment the content you’d be willing to pay for anyway. Not to mention you could then get your own dvb-s equipment in your media centre and have a much greater control over the watching and recording of the content you’re paying for.</p>

<p>My grandfather in Hyde Park, New York had this huge in one of the box’s on the Telephone poll that he wanted removed for obvious reasons. He called the city and asked them to do something about it. The city referred him to the local electric company (Central Hudson) who came out to inspect the nest. They told him that the bee’s nest was inside a Telephone company (ATT) box and that they wouldn’t touch it.  So he called ATT and asked them to come remove the bee’s nest ATT comes out inspects the nest and then tells him they won’t do anything because a cable company (Time Warner) has some wires near the entrance of the box. So he calls Time Warner to come out and remove the bee’s. Time Warner comes out and says “You have a bee’s nest we are not equipped to care of this” and referrers him to pest control. Pest control came out and removed the bee’s nest for a fee of $175 and was told to go after the companies to refund him. My grandfather passed away before any company was willing to give him a refund for the bee’s. Two weeks ago my grandmother got a check for the sum of $175usd from Central Hudson (The power company)</p>

<p>We already have Sky. its multiroom im getting. Normally multiroom would plug into your current dish but as i say… buildings are gonna be built so theres no point doing it there and then having to pay for someone later on to move it anyway</p>
<p>Sky dont do roof’s apparently… And ours is 3 storys up.</p>
<p>Im not going to do it my self because i dont even know what im doing.</p>
<p>i think they wont put a hold on the charge because they cant tell wheter i have connected it or not… so it would be too easy to connect it and not say.</p>
<p>Rang a guy and he said he’d be able to do it all inclusive for £40 on thursday morning so got that booked <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>if you’re not against getting up on the roof (and can do it safely) it’s really not that hard to fit yourself, i did my dvb-s installation myself and thats on the same satellites as sky digital (28.8e astra)</p>

We have ombudsmen in Australia which handle this sort of dispute; I imagine you would have a similar system in place.</p>

              <p>So yea… Went go get Sky+HD Multiroom</p>
<p>Sky came out and because there is a huge trench underneith our current sky dish they cannot get to it for “Safety reasons”</p>
<p>So they turned round and said, We’ll leave ALL the stuff needed to set up a new dish on the roof… Just get someone to come out and fit it.</p>
<p>Must have rang about 8 companies in my immediate area and they all want a minimum of £70 -.-</p>
<p>Meanwhile Sky have started charging us for Multiroom as they have left the box.</p>
