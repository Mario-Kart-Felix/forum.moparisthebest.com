    <title>Ubuntu Wireless Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ubuntu-wireless-help/135035</link>
    <description>Hello!
I am currently about to install Ubuntu 7.04 onto my laptop, but I am having some problems connecting to my wireless network, as it simply cannot find it.
I have a Wireless - N RangeMax Next wireless router model wnr834m netgear router.
I am not sure about the laptops wireless card, but it is built in and can get 54.0 mbps from the router, so its a b/g card i think??
If anyone can help me it would be very much appreciated as my Linksys Wireless B router is now junky and I don&#39;t want to have to use 2 routers!
Thanks
Justis
EDIT
It is now working, I found out linux is quite picky with capitalization [not Netgear but NETGEAR to connect].</description>
