    <title>A few Questions hard to answer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-questions-hard-to-answer/230223</link>
    <description>Ok well ive heard you can set up a p server to a hosting company if you can how do you?

Next question is how do you make a cutscene if this has been found out yet i would like to know please because I need one soon as you register and log in your in a cutscene where 3 gods are sitting at a table arguing and it makes them turn on each other then it shows their castles and people marching out to go and attack the other gods....


And if anyone has coded one yet is there cannons where you shoot castles and they blow holes in them? if not its ok im working on coding one right now but if there is one already it would save great time and lots of stress....</description>

yes, go to google search dedicated server host. and you can find out on a site…<br>
answer 2-<br>
its possible to make a cut scene… but what ur asking for is hard… because its never been made like that… but u can make it but ur gonna need alot of players to make it… such as around 70 players… to make the cut scene and all u do is record a vid… with a hyper cam or something… and then add it in to ur client so when u log in it gives that scene…<br>
answer 3-<br>
never been made… impossible to make unless u can make fake walls and excellent gfx models… other wise you wont be able to make it work.</p>
