Mistex is returning to the rsps world under new management, and we are excited to give you a much more improved version of the game. I come to you here on behalf of our team in order to recruit a few members to take part in our journey. The server is set to release next Friday between the times of 2 and 3 pm eastern. We are currently looking for one to two developers, a graphics artist, and one or two moderators to manage the game during the release. We expect to have a huge release this friday. Unfortunately we will be pretty picky when picking our staff because honestly they are major contributors to a successful server.
