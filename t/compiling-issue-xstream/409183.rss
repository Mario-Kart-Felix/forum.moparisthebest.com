    <title>Compiling Issue: XStream;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/compiling-issue-xstream/409183</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve moved my server over to another computer, installed JDK 7 then thought it was that that caused the problem so I downgraded to JDK 6_26 and ever since then I get this:

[code=batch]
src\com\rs2\world\XMLManager.java:9: package com.thoughtworks.xstream does not e
xist
import com.thoughtworks.xstream.XStream;
                               ^
src\com\rs2\world\XMLManager.java:20: cannot find symbol
symbol  : class XStream
location: class com.rs2.world.XMLManager
        public static XStream xstream;
                      ^
src\com\rs2\world\XMLManager.java:23: cannot find symbol
symbol  : class XStream
location: class com.rs2.world.XMLManager
                xstream = new XStream();
                              ^
3 errors
Press any key to continue . . .
[/code]

My server worked fine before and now I can&#39;t even run my server because all my server settings are in XML and I need to fix this before continuing.

Has the import changed or something? I know it&#39;s a valid import because 1: it worked before and 2: Google shows it&#39;s valid from other people&#39;s code, so I really don&#39;t get it. Any help?

Edit: I also had to rewrite  a compiler from scratch because my current didn&#39;t work for some reason. I think it may be getting confused because I use src\com\rs2\* in every line, whereas it really should be com\rs2 and maybe that&#39;s what&#39;s the problem... here&#39;s the first line of my compiler just incase.

[code=batch]
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_26\bin\javac.exe&quot; -classpath . -d bin src\com\rs2\*.java src\com\rs2\content\*.java
