    <title>Mute command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mute-command/271501</link>
    <description>Hello,

Sorry for the posting but im just mainly looking for Mute and getting Weapons to work proberly lol.
But anyway when i went to look for an Mute command on the Serach. Found one but seems to not work.
Here what it looks like

if (command.startsWith(&quot;mute&quot;)) {
try {
 String mutedName = command.substring(5);
 int mutedPlayer = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(mutedName);
 client m = (client) server.playerHandler.players[mutedPlayer];
 m.silent = 1;
 sendMessage(mutedName+&quot; has been permanently muted&quot;);
 m.sendMessage(&quot;A member of staff has permanently muted you&quot;);
}
catch(Exception e) {
 sendMessage(&quot;Enter the name of the player you want to permanently mute&quot;);
}

That that. but when i complie it doesnt like &quot; m.silent = 1;&quot; in it.
So really im just wondering if anyone could tell me what need fixing with this or anyone can give me a WORKING ::mute command.

Plus im still looking for someone to help me with existing thing.. there nothink in Item.JAVA that has a weapon slot/place. So can anyone tell me what to do?

Thank You.</description>

              <p>no the item.java thing was just an example. If you were to put public static int rings [] then all of them would be put into the ring slot. Do you get what I mean? you just change the last word for what slot you want it to go in body, legs, etc. That’s why I said to download another server and look at the item.java.</p>
<p>Also what errors did you get from the mute code?</p>

              <p>This is the one I have in my server and it works so maybe try it.</p>

try {<br>
String otherPName = command.substring(5);<br>
int otherPIndex = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(otherPName);</p>
<pre><code>                if (otherPIndex != -1) {
                    client p = (client) server.playerHandler.players[otherPIndex];

                    p.muted = true;
		writeLog(p.playerName, "mutes");

                    yell("["+playerName+"] has just Muted "+p.playerName+"!");
                     
                } else { 
                   sendMessage("The name doesnt exist."); 
                }
            } catch (Exception e) { 
                sendMessage("Try entering a name you want to mute..");
            }
        }[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>Also for item.java here is what part of mine looks like for an example:</p>
<p><code>public static int amulets[] = {4035,6577, 10519, 10413, 11204, 11205,
			11147, 11148, 11149, 11150, 11151, 11152, 11141, 6857, 6859, 6861,
			6863, 1724, 1718, 6585, 86, 774, 87, 295, 421, 552, 589, 1478,
			1692, 1694, 1696, 1698, 1722, 1702, 1704, 1706, 1708, 1710, 1712,
			1725, 1727, 1729, 1731, 4021, 4081, 4250, 4677, 6040, 6041, 6208,
			11274, 11275, 11276, 11273, 11941 };</code><br>
I would suggest you download a source that has one already and looking at it though.</p>
