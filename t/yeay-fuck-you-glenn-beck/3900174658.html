        <p>[quote=“Thug-life, post:20, topic:390017”]What biased stuff do they show in their news? I’d love to know any substantial stuff that hasn’t resulted in them receiving a public bollocking. Because I’m sorry, I won’t accept anyone claiming anything otherwise as anything less than complete bullshit.</p>
<p>Their documentaries are another thing, you can’t get in the way of such content creation or you’ll end up with substandard crap. They still have to meet BBC guidelines, but interfering in such production isn’t healthy.[/quote] Asking me what is biased is like me asking you what is the truth? You don’t know for sure, and if you think you do… you’re so very wrong.</p>
<p>If you want to see what I mean though just choose a controversial subject and start looking at the news articles on it over a period of 10 years or so. Anything discussing drugs and the laws surround them is all over the place with contradicting facts and quotes. The quotes are what tends to be leading it towards bias because they pick and choose some really fucking dumb quotes that state “facts” that just blatantly aren’t true.</p>
<p>For an example though; David Nutt is the most recent I can think of.</p>

<p>The news is unbiased, they report all sides. However they give the impression the government is right.</p>

<p>Haha, I just lost a lot of respect for you. Enjoy your narrow minded life though.</p>
<p>Pointing fingers and screaming “conspiracy” is why the world is as fucked as it is now. You believe the BBC because you choose to. When they take any news they choose what to publish and what not to. That can be manipulated, by the reporter, by the editor for whatever personal reasons they want. Doesn’t have to be a “hidden agenda” as you put it on IRC. Most of the time it wont even be intentional, the person writing the article could just be ignorant of the truth.</p>
<p>You’re the one arguing the BBC is not-biased, I’m the one simply stating you can’t possibly know that, and if you continue to argue they are you’re just fucking retarded. News can be manipulated in the most subtle of ways that you’ll never understand.</p>

<p>Of course it can. I’m saying they don’t purposely set out publish bias information, if they do - and people find it, it is removed or altered.</p>

<p>ARGUMENT FROM IGNORANCE. FALLACIOUS ARGUMENT.</p>

That's weak and low. Do you drink alcohol Thug-life? I don't drink alcohol at all and haven't for 2 years (never really did before then), but it's a really dangerous drug, actually very harmful and I think it could be effecting your ability to think  intelligently. I smoke a little every day, it helps me sleep. It has helped with depression. Hypocrisy.

<p>Congratulations you’re starting to understand, although in a sarcastic and horridly fucked-up arrogant way.</p>
<blockquote>but that is such an incredibly stupid argument to bring up in this context, it is an argument that leads nowhere</blockquote>
<p>Now I’m going to ask you to find me a debate on this forum that ever led to a valid conclusion. I didn’t derail or lead anything nowhere, its a simple fact… that you can’t know your right and the BBC cannot be proven to be non-biased. You can’t just dismiss it, you continue the debate around it. Assumptions have to be made, thus leading to difference of opinion, bias and this stupid argument. It’s like stating the BBC is unbiased because of the rules/guidelines they have to adhere to. Also a logical fallacy.</p>
<blockquote>Maybe mitb is collecting a database of our personalities is and is working on cyber clones of us all to eventually create simulations of us and start doing things on our online-behalf? YOU CANT KNOW IF HE ISNT DOING THAT SO DONT SAY HE ISNT!!!</blockquote>
<p>It would be of my opinion that none of this is possible in Moparisthebest’s home-made shed. Despite this I wouldn’t state its impossible, but I probably also wouldn’t pay attention to a post like this. Trying to make me look stupid with ridiculous notions isn’t really going to work.</p>

<p>You defended the BBC, I just wanted to open your eyes to the fact you could be wrong. I meant no insult to anyone in my post, I just tried to justify myself as you continued to reply. It might be “driven in” and “trivial” but you brought it upon yourself.</p>
<p>Off-topic; this is why I like to read my news from places like Reddit, relevant articles are linked to from major news sources, then the users scrutinise and find valid sources to confirm its reliability. (Although many comment threads get derailed now-a-days). Also I’m not saying reddit is a non biased news source, that would be totally fucking dumb. The mere fact each individual has the control of an upvote/downvote and the ability to comment against misinformation is what makes it better (for me).</p>

<p>The thing is none of us can ever be sure we’re being informed correctly. Unless we’re present and see the “news” as it happens.

<p>Just grabbing this whole Greeny-Thug-life debate by it’s roots: Of course you can’t be sure if you’re informed correctly unless being there when it happens. That’s the point of having a news show: We can’t be everywhere, so we have to rely on news stations and their numerous journalists around the world. When comparing the news stations we have in the Netherlands, I prefer the public one over the others because of quality of news and of presentation. If something’s happening abroad, I try to use local news stations too.</p>
<p>Covering the political news is a different story. Politicians usually play dirty games, and journalists need quite some experience to read between the lines. Politicians are influenced by election results, other manifestations of public opinion and by lobbyists. So when people like Prof. Nutt get fired, alarm bells should ring. It’s likely he was fired because of lobbyists and the fear of conservative voters voting for someone else.</p>
<p>So the bias you guys are discussing is a different kind of bias than seen on Fox News. Fox adds it’s own bias, whereas the BBC sometimes (whether they know it or not) copies the bias from their sources. I’d say it’s because of lack of experience, and the growing tendency of being ‘trendy’.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for understanding. This is the sort of bias I was referring to with the David Nutt thing. The fact they made him out to look like he was right when he released the study, then when he was fired all of a sudden he was   headlined as “wrong”.</p>
<p>I’d dig deeper and find quotes within articles, but I really can’t be bothered. Which is why I didn’t want to find examples for Thug-life. Finding examples is damn hard because I read news daily on a RSS feed and have done for years, when I read something I know to be biased (perhaps after reading multiple sources) I’ll realise and get annoyed at that. Obviously as weeks go by I forget and when something like this topic comes along it’s not like I have hours to spend finding them.</p>
<p>EDIT: OK so lucky me, I remembered something that annoyed me; the government decided no scientific advice was needed from the ACMD (Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ) for reclassifying drug laws (after Nutt was sacked). This is completely outrageous, like going back to the times when “politicians knew better than everyone else”.</p>
<p>I read about this at the time from a few places, none of which were mainstream news outlets. The BBC article which eventually covered this issue, took the stance from the campaigners point of view; (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11923644" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11923644</a>). Subtleties, campaigners for drugs… why headline the campaigners and not the changes to the policy like everyone else who reported on this? Bringing the campaigners to the spotlight, labelling them as drug campaigners instantly a turn off for anyone reading the article who thinks they don’t use drugs (“think” because half the country is addicted to caffeine and alcohol). Then they have some government quotations at the bottom saying its essentially lies.</p>
<p>To get the real story, you have to click on the reporters BBC blog; <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/markeaston/2010/12/politics_v_science_yet_again.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/markeaston/2010/12/politics_v_science_yet_again.html</a></p>
<p>And there is the same story with no bullshit. Actually addressing the issue, notice headlined “Politics vs Science, yet again”. Which is the real issue at hand.</p>

<p>I always thought that goes without saying. What Greeny was saying to me made me assume he was trying to imply something more than that.</p>
<p>It would be naive of me to assume the BBC is perfect, they don’t make mistakes and they don’t relay news that is biased. Calling the BBC biased, which is what sparked this off, assumes they have an agenda to push. I know Greeny has already addressed this, but that is really the only way I can see that as a problem.</p>
<p>The only thing I mean when I say that, with almost absolute certainty, that the BBC isn’t biased is that they always try to report the news in such a way that doesn’t mean the BBC seems to support any particular opinion. Them reporting on news that everyone else is reporting on, but is a little biased that doesn’t make them biased as they are purely relaying that information. On their TV news shows, the presenters will sometimes try and add balance to a news piece by stating what the opposition think, too.</p>
<p>So really, if it is just what you said, then there is little point continuing on. Because I agree with what you’re saying, but I don’t know what that adds, any of my original comments, i don’t think were going against that. It is just one of those things that I always assumed that wouldn’t need to be mentioned, we all know that.</p>
