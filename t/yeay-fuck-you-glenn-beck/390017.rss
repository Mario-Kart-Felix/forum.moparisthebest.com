    <description>An e-mail I received from colorofchange.org
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear Robert,

Our community just won an important and hard-fought victory. After more than 285,000 people spoke out, leading to a loss of over 300 advertisers from his top-rated show, Glenn Beck&#39;s program on Fox News Channel will come to an end this year.1

This is huge. Beck&#39;s record of race-baiting is virtually unsurpassed among mainstream media figures, and Fox News has continued to give him a platform -- until now.

We launched our campaign against Beck in July of 2009 after he topped a week of race-baiting directed at President Obama with the most stunning statement of them all—he called Obama a &quot;racist&quot; who has &quot;a deep-seated hatred for white people, or the white culture.&quot;

Within days we approached Fox News&#39; advertisers, asking them to stop supporting Beck&#39;s poisonous statements with their dollars. Nearly 300,000 people signed statements that we presented to advertisers. Thousands of others made phone calls when our staff&#39;s calls and member comments weren&#39;t enough. Within weeks, dozens of advertisers dropped the show. In the end, more than 300 advertisers decided that Beck was too much of a liability and requested that their commercials not be shown during Beck&#39;s program.

In their statement announcing the shift, Fox News trumpeted Beck&#39;s ratings success. In reality, Beck&#39;s audience and ratings have been on the decline. Fox has also steadily refused to admit the obvious impact that the loss of more than 300 blue chip advertisers has on their bottom line. Beck&#39;s only advertisers have been lower-tier brands that could not have earned Fox News as much revenue as the upper-level brands—thus turning a show that should have been a top earner into a financial liability.

Together, we&#39;ve succeeded in doing something very important. We&#39;ve helped hammer home the message that deception and race-baiting are not acceptable for a &quot;news&quot; network and that everyday people will hold accountable those who are responsible.

Beck will remain with Fox News Channel as a producer, and we&#39;ll be watching for what might come from that. And we&#39;ll continue to push back on Fox&#39;s race-baiting problem, which of course goes beyond Beck. But today&#39;s victory is important: Beck&#39;s voice, his incessant conspiracy theories, his dangerous incitement to violence, his casual race-baiting—all of these will be gone from television by year&#39;s end. And that&#39;s something for which we should all be proud.

We want to thank CREDO, Media Matters, MoveOn.org, and StopBeck—all of whom played critical roles in the effort. But more than anyone, we want to thank YOU, our members, who helped us win this important victory. We couldn&#39;t have done it without you.

<p>The part I never understand in religious peoples arguments:</p>
<p>So life is too complex to be here by chance, but god is not? A human is complex enough to require a creator, but god can just spontaneously erupt from nothing? Is that an admission, then, that man is greater than god? Doesn’t sound very Christian to me.</p>

<p>So “almost always”, nice vague get-out clause there. But its still vulnerable to hijacking by interested parties.<br>
We see now that doubt is being manufactured by religious groups against evolution. We see how uncertainty and doubt about climate change is being spread by companies with agendas. We see how Linux and Free Software are victims of fear, uncertainty, doubt by software companies worried about losing profits.</p>
<p>Everybody now accepts smoking is very bad for you, but in the 1950s when it was first discovered, cigarette companies spent massive amounts of money creating doubt in the media, same way as happens today. If you followed moparisthebest’s rule back then you’d be forced to conclude that smoking is only a little bit harmful.</p>
<p>Everybody now accepts that Jews aren’t too bad. But for centuries Jewish people were seen as wrong people who killed Jesus. Back then, with mitb’s logic, you’d be compelled to say that it was okay to seize all a Jew’s property (which is roughly halfway between leaving them alone and enacting genocide against them)</p>
<p>Everybody now accepts that black and white people should be equal, but when that was first proposed there was quite a lot of opposition. With mitb’s rule you’d have to say that black people are a little bit inferior.</p>
<p>Everybody now accepts that gay people should have some rights (even the catholic church doesn’t think they should be killed, barred from employment or deported.) Yet for centuries they’d be forced to hide their sexuality for fear of attacks by the community.</p>
<p>So it seems to me, the midpoint thing is roughly true except in all those cases when it isn’t true.</p>

<p>I might have to explain my earlier statement where I said that perhaps the truth lies in between two extremes. This to me only applied to news coverage, when you have two biased news sources.

</aside>
<p>Just perhaps?</p>
<p>The actual truth is that evolution is just like any other well established scientific theory. The only reason you put the word ‘perhaps’ in front is because a politically motivated group has spent a lot of time and a large amount of money to convince the common person their bronze age book of myths holds more truth than the science.</p>
<p>In this case, the creationist side is simply wrong. The world is not 6000 years ago, living things were not created independently. Every biologist’s work is based on it, no senior clergy or theologians doubts it.</p>
<p>Okay if you don’t like the evolution vs creation argument how about the climate change denial vs climate change science.<br>
One is well-supported science with the vast majority of scientists agreeing with it. The other is a politically motivated group for special interest groups like fossil fuel companies and anarcho-capitalists worried about the size of the state.</p>
<p>That idea of taking the midpoint of all possible opinions leaves you open to those who are financially strong but intellectually weak. There exist people who have the money to push issues into the public sphere even when those issues are fallacious and show clear self-interest.</p>

</aside>
<p>I always thought that goes without saying. What Greeny was saying to me made me assume he was trying to imply something more than that.</p>
<p>It would be naive of me to assume the BBC is perfect, they don’t make mistakes and they don’t relay news that is biased. Calling the BBC biased, which is what sparked this off, assumes they have an agenda to push. I know Greeny has already addressed this, but that is really the only way I can see that as a problem.</p>
<p>The only thing I mean when I say that, with almost absolute certainty, that the BBC isn’t biased is that they always try to report the news in such a way that doesn’t mean the BBC seems to support any particular opinion. Them reporting on news that everyone else is reporting on, but is a little biased that doesn’t make them biased as they are purely relaying that information. On their TV news shows, the presenters will sometimes try and add balance to a news piece by stating what the opposition think, too.</p>
<p>So really, if it is just what you said, then there is little point continuing on. Because I agree with what you’re saying, but I don’t know what that adds, any of my original comments, i don’t think were going against that. It is just one of those things that I always assumed that wouldn’t need to be mentioned, we all know that.</p>

I love the BBC for comedy and entertainment, but I’m not going to be as quick to defend the news as TL and yakman because they often show biased stuff in their news and documentaries. Nothing like the US mind, but they do still love to wrap stories up in bullshit.</p>
<p>The thing is none of us can ever be sure we’re being informed correctly. Unless we’re present and see the “news” as it happens. I’m not one for many conspiracy theories but I truly do believe our governments think they can “trick most of the people, most of the time” and they do a damn good job of it.<br>

<p>Just grabbing this whole Greeny-Thug-life debate by it’s roots: Of course you can’t be sure if you’re informed correctly unless being there when it happens. That’s the point of having a news show: We can’t be everywhere, so we have to rely on news stations and their numerous journalists around the world. When comparing the news stations we have in the Netherlands, I prefer the public one over the others because of quality of news and of presentation. If something’s happening abroad, I try to use local news stations too.</p>
<p>Covering the political news is a different story. Politicians usually play dirty games, and journalists need quite some experience to read between the lines. Politicians are influenced by election results, other manifestations of public opinion and by lobbyists. So when people like Prof. Nutt get fired, alarm bells should ring. It’s likely he was fired because of lobbyists and the fear of conservative voters voting for someone else.</p>
<p>So the bias you guys are discussing is a different kind of bias than seen on Fox News. Fox adds it’s own bias, whereas the BBC sometimes (whether they know it or not) copies the bias from their sources. I’d say it’s because of lack of experience, and the growing tendency of being ‘trendy’.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thank you so much for understanding. This is the sort of bias I was referring to with the David Nutt thing. The fact they made him out to look like he was right when he released the study, then when he was fired all of a sudden he was   headlined as “wrong”.</p>
<p>I’d dig deeper and find quotes within articles, but I really can’t be bothered. Which is why I didn’t want to find examples for Thug-life. Finding examples is damn hard because I read news daily on a RSS feed and have done for years, when I read something I know to be biased (perhaps after reading multiple sources) I’ll realise and get annoyed at that. Obviously as weeks go by I forget and when something like this topic comes along it’s not like I have hours to spend finding them.</p>
<p>EDIT: OK so lucky me, I remembered something that annoyed me; the government decided no scientific advice was needed from the ACMD (Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ) for reclassifying drug laws (after Nutt was sacked). This is completely outrageous, like going back to the times when “politicians knew better than everyone else”.</p>
<p>I read about this at the time from a few places, none of which were mainstream news outlets. The BBC article which eventually covered this issue, took the stance from the campaigners point of view; (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11923644" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11923644</a>). Subtleties, campaigners for drugs… why headline the campaigners and not the changes to the policy like everyone else who reported on this? Bringing the campaigners to the spotlight, labelling them as drug campaigners instantly a turn off for anyone reading the article who thinks they don’t use drugs (“think” because half the country is addicted to caffeine and alcohol). Then they have some government quotations at the bottom saying its essentially lies.</p>
<p>To get the real story, you have to click on the reporters BBC blog; <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/markeaston/2010/12/politics_v_science_yet_again.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/markeaston/2010/12/politics_v_science_yet_again.html</a></p>
<p>And there is the same story with no bullshit. Actually addressing the issue, notice headlined “Politics vs Science, yet again”. Which is the real issue at hand.</p>
