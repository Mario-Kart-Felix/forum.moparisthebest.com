    <title>[PI] Dropped items dissapearing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-dropped-items-dissapearing/409933</link>
    <description>Hi everyone,

For some reason on the server all dropped items dissapear, except those dropped after PKing or from monsters. I would love to hold drop events where people can earn some extra cash,

Thanks, Gergy.

EDIT: Fixed it, the file is called dropitem.java and 1 line of code was //commented out</description>
