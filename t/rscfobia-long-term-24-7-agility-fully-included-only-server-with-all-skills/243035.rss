    <description>Intro: We are one of the most close servers to real RSC. One of the bot-free servers!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjSN2JD1FDs - made by &quot;Elf&quot;

Hello, MoparScape members!
It has been quite a while since RSC was closed to free players and there are, in fact, some servers around. But they all die in a day or two.

Let me introduce you a NEW server: RSCFobia!
Why is this better than all others? It has ALL skills. You can even train agility, at Gnome Agility course!
Experience rate is fairly low, but not too low. Whenever you want to go to wilderness to kill people, you can use ::fatigue command and get your fatigue instantly to 100%! Sounds great? There&#39;s more...

RSCFobia is only server with agility &amp; all skills functioning properly! This is only server that has them all done(even agility shortcuts). 

Server&#39;s moderator-team is very friendly and helpful against new players. They won&#39;t supply you with free items, though, but they do help you out if you are in trouble.

RSCFobia has MANY active events every week and an easter drop coming this weekend, which brings together MANY players all over the world. This is a friendly, BOT-FREE community, which is enjoyable for everyone.

There are all monster drops 100% like in real RSC, world looks like that aswell, enough of fake maps!

The server has also working and MULTI-FUNCTIONAL highscores! You can view your own characters even, or filter the results by people on your friends list! It is really advanced and great system.

So what are you waiting for? Grab your weapons, armor and start your epic adventure on this, brand-new long-term server! Call all your friends and make server even more enjoyable.

I pretty much enjoy it and all my friends do. I think this is the best server. It has no autoers and the administrators do know what they are doing. Best and most advanced server out there!  :P

You must register at forums and register a character to be able to play.
See you ingame!

Hey, would be great if you took away the “(Only server with ALL skills)” since that is a lie, Termz server also has all skills =]<br>
[/quote]This is meant with all full skills. And termz? Would you mind telling me, who the fuck? And if you mean vortexbot server, then this has VERY primitive system and full of bugs.</p>
<p>And you can’t even get exact actiontexts nor dialogues for your server.[/quote]<br>
Might be alot of bugs as you refer to it but it’s all skills? right, or are you stupid? And what the fuck is vortexbot server? Never heard of it, you might mean Vortex Server and if you didn’t you must be completly retarded.</p>
<p>Right now i dont have much to do with RSCHeros, it’s Termz who is coding etc.</p>

<p>And credits for the base? There would be no server without the base. Not to mention a lot of the data Reines recieved to update the game was from regular contributing members (CamHart, Alex, j0hnnie, Brian). Also, you’re using Darkarmy’s self-created images on your highscores page.</p>
<p>So fuck off that someone used a few lines of code you thought of to make.</p>
<p>And the toolbox is Reines’ own code. It has nothing to do with PunBB or RSCDaemon. Why did you steal someone else’s code and put in on your website?</p>
<p>Oh wait that’s right. The whole server is stolen[/quote]</p>
<p>The toolbox has the credits on the page… This is nothing to do with stealing code it’s about <em>knowingly</em> stealing code and not crediting it.</p>
<p>I can’t give credit to people when I don’t know that they should be credited. However now that you’ve highlighted the fact that I’m missing some important credits I shall include them.</p>
<p>Though, what Stashah did was different, he knew that he decompiled and stole code from my client and therefore has no excuse for trying to hide that fact.</p>
<p>As for: “it not being hard to do”, if it’s not hard to do then why waste time decompiling a client and just code it yourself?</p>
<p>Stashah, didn’t realise it was your forum, oh wait, it isn’t. Don’t tell me what I can and cannot post or where I can post it.</p>
