    <title>Two very large problems.. one involving trading</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/two-very-large-problems-one-involving-trading/146452</link>
    <description>To start off, I have been adding a large amount of custom &#39;stuff&#39; to a server that I downloaded. I forget which server it was, but it is compatible with Silab&#39;s items. The main problem is within the trading. I have tested on many other servers and none of them have this problem.

To start off, clicking trade is perfectly normal. The other person accepts your request, and heres where the fun begins. If you put up ANY item, it instantly turns into &quot;varrock armour 3&quot; (item id 11999). The other player does not see the armour in the trade screen, instead they see NOTHING. After accepting, the second screen shows only this. &quot;you are about to recieve: dragon kiteshield&quot; and &quot;you are about to give: Dragon platebody&quot;. I have replaced ALL of the trading methods, to where it does not show the dragon armour, but the varrock armours still replace all traded items, and they don&#39;t show up in the second trade screen for the other person.

---SIMPLY PUT: I can not trade items due to any item put up for trade turns into a nonexisting item.


The second problem, involves death. When you die in any way shape or form:
from your screen, you appear back at the spawn point.
from other players screen, you spawn exactly where you died.
the server registers you as being at the NORMAL spawn point, so your character can be thousands of pixels off from other players view.
the only way to fix is to: either barrage them, or kick them.
