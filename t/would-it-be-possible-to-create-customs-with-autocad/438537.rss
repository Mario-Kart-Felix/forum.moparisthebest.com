    <title>Would it be possible to create customs with AutoCad?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/would-it-be-possible-to-create-customs-with-autocad/438537</link>
    <description>I can&#39;t use Metaseq., it pisses me off. It&#39;s *too* simple, and I already know everything about A-Cad, and I&#39;ve had AutoCad I have had YEARS of experience with it. Really hoping if it&#39;s possible. I don&#39;t see why not, right? Just make a model, load it up in the make.dat program, and bam.. working model. It might take a while to get a reply to this, but it&#39;s worth asking.</description>

              <p>Uh. One the model created in any Computer Aided Drafting program would exceed polys of over 30,000 if you have any sort of bevel in it. So, with that aside… Yes, you could. The only problem is that the only person to really create any type of converter was MrPotatoHead and he is long gone, now. So either you create a converter for your .cad or whatever extension they use to .dat. If you are extremely interested in doing this, go download a hex editor and open up the .dat to try and make heads or tails of how it uses those values to draw a model.</p>

<p>I already have it and yes, I’ts been here since I was a kid. My dad got it for free when he worked as an architect. I’ve been playing with it for eight years, and really want to do this.</p>
