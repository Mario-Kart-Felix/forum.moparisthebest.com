    <title>LastRune - 718 Zombie Survival Server (IN NEED OF DEVS)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lastrune-718-zombie-survival-server-in-need-of-devs/546205</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, this is the first time I have ever posted on anything rsps related, so bare with me. I have been coding for 4 years now, have taken coding classes before, am going to be taking advanced java programming at my home school, and am going to vocational school for computer science. After high school(i&#39;m 17 atm almost 18), i plan on getting a bachelors in computer science, any who enough about me..

I AM LOOKING FOR CODERS TO HELP ME WITH THIS PROJECT, IF ANYONE;S INTERESTED, HMU ON SKYPE: xpowerofprox

I have plenty ideas for the server, including customizing the quest tab, populating the shit out of cities to make it more realistic, but where you can find much more loot and perhaps even a zombie city boss. I have so much more instore for the server and hopefully will gain more developers on this project to help me out. My goals are to run the server, for as long as i can, hopefully years, and afterwards when the server no longer exists, to release this as a template for zombie survival 718 rsps&#39;s everywhere! :)

Now lets get to media(only 3 sorry about that)
