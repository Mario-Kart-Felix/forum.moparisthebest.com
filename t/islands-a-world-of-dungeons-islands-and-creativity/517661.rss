[B]Latest update summary:[/B] A couple of NEW PICTURES have been posted on the forums ^_^ Come and join the community early!


For those of you who knew of or played my former server Shilo, [i]Islands[/i] is very similar in regards to play-style, but with new locations, monsters, and a better feel in general. The fact that everything I need is pretty much in the game areas I&#39;m using, as opposed to spawning everything, makes for easier development, and therefore more updates more frequently. Those who know me or know my previous works know that I love old-schoolish gameplay with a very simplistic approach. I enjoy community based environments that are more close (figuratively and literally, as the playable areas in the server are close-quarters) and tight-knit than other servers, which is my goal for [i]Islands[/i].

# All released skills working near 100%; includes all but Farming and Agility
# Combat system works almost flawlessly, including auto-retaliation and aggression
# Solid dialogue and quest systems, although quests are still in question
# Very unique content and areas, based mostly (if not all) on islands and dungeons
# Programmed with near-perfection in mind, so bugs and kinks in current content are pretty scarce
# Community and goal oriented, geared more towards training and an economy than PKing
# Huge opportunity for more unique, interesting, and fun updates


I&#39;ll update this topic as I go, although most things are already programmed. I started with a nearly scratch source and built almost everything myself, skills and other content included.

Please spread the word and keep this topic up top, you won&#39;t regret it. Thanks for reading![/QUOTE]</description>
