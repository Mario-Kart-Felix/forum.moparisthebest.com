    <description>Ok, i followed the step by step guide, on runelocus to create a server. The one thing that i didn&#39;t do, was i didn&#39;t port forward, but i amm using utorrent which should portforward by it&#39;s self. I have team viewer and if you could help me i will give you anything within my power. i will give you co, owner what ever, i just want to know how. i have an at&amp;t motem if that helps any. i keep getting error connecting to server, which i am trying to log in from a different computer. i also have no-ip. IDK PLEASE HELP!!!!</description>
