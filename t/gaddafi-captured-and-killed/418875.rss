              <p>Let’s hope that Libya won’t turn into another Iraq or Afghanistan. Whether there are Western soldiers on the ground or not, it sure isn’t an occupational force. So the Libyans are going to have to fix their country up themselves, which they are probably better at than the US army (or any other foreign army). I hope Libya will become an example for African nations, where the country itself is the major benefactor of it’s natural resources. It’s not only Arab countries that are ruled by corrupt dictators, most African countries are.</p>

<p>if you want to trust anonymous sources working for tabloid newspapers, and I’m not sure why you would, then yes there MAY have been some ex sas members coordinating airstrikes on the ground in libya, however all that was officially deployed was some planes, jets, helicopters, boats and subs, absolutely no ground forces</p>

You’re a fucking idiot. He said the same thing when he campaigned in 2008, and he sent 40k more during 2009. NOW hes trying to go back to his ‘promises’ to get re-elected.[/quote]I would have said the same thing if it weren’t for him having 2 months to do it. If he wanted to bs with it again, he’d give us a time-period that was far longer. So before resorting to insults, might i remind you that it was essentially us who got you to open your eyes and research shit in the first place.</p>

Johan is still a idiot, but you are wrong. He need the Iraq troops somewhere else, so he is taking them out. So there is no sanity in the white house, just a corrupt bastard.</p>

<p>It isn’t that easy to just decide to start drilling, where will the investment come from? The same reason, under Gadaffi, they didn’t drill under libyan owned companies or state, is the same reason they’d have other companies come in and do it now. Libya doesn’t have the money to do it properly themselves, they’ll struggle for money to set up the essential infrastructure the country needs.</p>
<p>The Libyans will be the ones agreeing to the deals, they’ll make sure they get the profit they want. They’re not state owned companies that will be over in Libya, other than Qatar’s state oil company which is already getting involved, apparently.</p>

So… why can’t Libya keep their own oil?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Uh:</p>
<ol>
<li>Libya has a small population, 6 - 7 million people. They don’t need as much oil as their country is capable of producing.</li>
<li>It would be an absolutely fantastic source of income for it, they don’t have their own infrastructure or the money to build it, other than what currently exists.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution? Let established oil companies drill there, with a large portion of the profits of oil taken being directed back to the Libyan government. Like it happens all over the world already.[/quote]</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Norway has fewer inhabitants and produce more oil. And we don’t have any problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or they can drill their own oil, and make the people in Libya richer.</p>
</li>

              <p>Gaddafi met with a lot of world leaders, until the last moments before the revolution. They are a bunch of hypocrites, they support him when they need him, and drop him as soon as the revolution starts. It seems to me that oil goes before everything, especially human rights. This only shows that the idea that giving money from the oil to the government isn’t good enough, so I’d say get the fuck out of Nigeria.</p>
<p>The fighters probably executed Gadaffi, which is a bad thing. After seeing the video linked to by Radeon, you see that when a man is stripped of all his power, he’s nothing more than a weak old man, albeit with a few gunshot wounds. You almost feel sorry for him.</p>

<p>Many of the supporting countries had non-hostile relations with Gadaffi not so long ago. The CIA handed over captives to the Libyan government, because they didn’t have limits when it came to torture. One of the men currently leading the NTC was a former Guantanamo bay inmate.</p>
