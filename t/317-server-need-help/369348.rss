    <title>317 server, need help</title>

    <description>Okay so this server I&#39;m taking over has recently died and I&#39;m basically bringing it back to life :D.

Anywho, on the server players are able to eat food without it delaying their attacks (just like a pot on rs) also you never need to click &#39;attack&#39; more than once on a player during a fight, because it constantly attacks normally with no delays and never stops attacking untill you either run/tele/die. I would like to change this so it is just like normal runescape.

Also, when you&#39;re barraging somebody if you&#39;re not 4+ squares away from them they can still attack you with meele I would like to change it so it is just like normal runescape.

Also, when you switch weapons (for example from full meele gear to master wand and ahrims) it will wack the person with the master wand because you keep on constantly attacking (it might have something to do with constant auto-retaliate, not sure) I would like to change it so when you switch a weapon you stop attacking.

Thanks a lot, Postman.</description>
