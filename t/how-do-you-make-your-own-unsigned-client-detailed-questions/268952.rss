    <description>dear moparscape staff and members,

I wanted to know if anyone knows how to make your own client. you knwo how skullcrush has their client and bogus123 has theirs.
I wanted to make my own so the items i want to make and the places people can go will be available. please let me know if this is possible for a guy like me to do. I totaly understand if you think im not capable to do this wether because im not smart enough or just from the way i type the text you see on the screen right now. 

thank you for your time in reading this.
