    <title>How do I make it where you need anti d-shield to kill kbd?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-make-it-where-you-need-anti-d-shield-to-kill-kbd/287523</link>
    <description>So if like, you went to kbd without shield, he would blow fire at you and hit 50&#39;s, but if you had shield he wouldnt hit as hard. How would i come about doing this?</description>
