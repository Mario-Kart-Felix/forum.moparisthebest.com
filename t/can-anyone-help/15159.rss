              <p>adn the higher you set your npcs hit points the higher and stronger it hits e.g: set it to 1000 hp it could hit anywhere from 0 - 350 so set your npcs hp carefuly <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Ok, You have to open your npc.cfg folder in notepad so you can edit it. (right click, open with, notepad) Now you have that opend look on your right hand side and you will see Combat helath below that edit the numbers that say 0 to a health e.g 100. That will adjust there helath. Now Save the changes. if your running your server make sure you restart it To see your NPC.</p>
