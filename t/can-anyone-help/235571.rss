    <description>Can anyone help with my problem?
I used GalkonsClientbase and tried putting new models in and it doesn&#39;t load the model... As I see other people are able to do this
Is it because they got a different base? I know im not doing something wrong i did a step by step guide. Also the galkons thing for some reason has a lot of nulls..... 
Can someone get me a new base or tell me how to fix it so i can add the models?

Post any links below/Tutorials

THANKS!!

Please help fast</description>
