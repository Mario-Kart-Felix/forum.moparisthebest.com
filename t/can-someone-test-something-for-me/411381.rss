    <title>Can someone test something for me?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone-test-something-for-me/411381</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to get a webclient to just work, and I am using a blank server to test a connection. I port forwarded, I am using no-ip and I keep trying to connect via no-ip, but it isnt loading up the server. I fully portforwarded and I think it has something to do with the no-ip client I am using.

I want to know if you can get a good connection through to the server, and can play it.(server [url=http://pdscape.webs.com/PdScape.htm]here[/url]).

:| Please help me?</description>
