    <title>Dynasty Dodian source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dynasty-dodian-source/541822</link>
    <description>Well, ive decided to release this to the world. The dodian sources keep getting harder and harder to find and so i release this to help dodian prevale.i use the name: Devilmccary, i dont credit myself in the source files or anything, just no point

Some of the features

Special attack (work 100%)
All owner,admin commands
Flawless combat system
All skills work
Woodcutting - Automatically fletches &quot;Logs&quot; to shafts without asking you how many you want to fletch.
Player Emotes work (About 80%)
All dodian areas are accessable (Exept ladder on ice mountain, Portals for rune ess mining)

I hope you guys like it, i would like to see some feedback or maybe fixes that i can apply for my own Dynasty dodian source(help would be good)

My work on client:
New and improved compiler that works with all jdk versions
Added npc&#39;s: Guard at yanille,Chickens at yanille, few major and minor bug fixes, Fire giants,Some bosses drops and drop rates, Fixed some doors, Grammar fixes, Exp rates fixes, Stats display fix
Added ::dropparty (just like the old dodian had, but has some nulls in it for drops, sliding peaces that wont crash you)

Bug: When dropping item it says error connecting to server and refreshes you, Monster combat/dmg needs to be fixed, No fishing spots at cathebry,Rune fullhelm bugged

More notes on the source
