    <title>How to portfoward?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-portfoward/374160</link>
    <description>Ok, I need help portfowarding my server because using hamachi is not doing anything for me, just gaining me 1 players per 3 weeks. So, I already portfowarded I guess? But its not working, I did what all the guides say, dl JDK, set up the environmental varibles, used no-ip and set up a host, dled the DUC for it, went to my ip address in the browser (192.168.2.* Not with the star) And added the thing with the name, TCP, port, and applyed the changes, it like magic its supposed to work? 1 thing is having to do the internet protocol 4 thing, I think that messed up my internet because I could not connect until I reset my router and modem 8 hours later. Is there any safe way to fix this without screwing up my internet?</description>

              <p>if you CANNOT portforward with an router, then use utorrent<br>
IF YOU CANNOT portforward with that, your last option would be getting a vps<br>
There is no way it can fail because all ports on a vps are already forwarded</p>
