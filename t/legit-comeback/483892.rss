well considering my cpu is about 8 years old and it was $60, not bad, though I cant really tell how good it is then. when I put it into a newer motherboard with more ram/cpu it will probably preform better <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
