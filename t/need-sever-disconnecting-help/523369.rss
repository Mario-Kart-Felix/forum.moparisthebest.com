    <description>Hey everyone, recently, I started a new project using the Lost Legacy source. After a day of working on it to get the cache working and getting it jarred, I finally put it on my vps and got it online. A few players logged in and after 3 hours of playing, I get an error message. So, I restarted server and after about another hour and 30 minutes, same error happened. Now, I know it has nothing to do with the VPS I am using because all my other servers before worked terrific. If someone could help me and fix this problem, I will be very appreciative. PM me if you can help me. I will then message you my skype details. Thank you. Below is the error that happens.
