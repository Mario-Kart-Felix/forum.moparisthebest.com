Well I have a project called Vividgamers, I am working on it in my spare time. I currently work on it about 1 - 2 hours everyday just to keep it running. I have had many comments on the old version. I am proud to announce that I am re-opening a server once I complete everything which is required for a server.

This server is going to be different unlike others this server will have a custom mini-game which is 100 percent done by Vividgamers, unlike those servers where you see that Barrows, Slayer, or GodSword mini-games have been leeched from newby sources (unique) such as allstar scape.

So below in this thread I will be showing previews of my hard work. I will show you many screenshots of how the server is looking and the computer specifications.

[b]
About the Server:[/b]

[i]The Host:[/i]

Yes I know the server isn&#39;t online yet but I am getting ready for hosting Beta. The hosting computer is quite advanced in certain ways.

[u]Specifications:[/u]
[list]
[li]Ram: 2GB[/li]
[li]Computer Processing Unit: 2GHZ (2000 Lines per second)[/li]
[li]Operating System: Windows Server 2003 [WS2003])[/li]
[li]Harddisk: 120GB (Including Windows Files[10GB])[/li][/list]

[u]Other information:[/u]
This PC is not a VPS it is currently hosted on road-runner internet the fastest around in the USA. Its average download speed is 4000KB&#39;s per second and the upload is roughly 1000KB&#39;s per second.

The computer has also been re-formatted so that our hosting computer is virus free.

[i]The Server:[/i]

[b]The Team[/b]
At the moment I am currently the only coder. But we have a hoster, his name is Evan so I suppose hes a member of the team.

[list]
[li]Luke[/li]
[li]Evan[/li]
[/list]

[b]Our Goals[/b]

[list]
[li]Block the All Go Free Bot [b]√[/b][/li]
[li]Clean the source [b]√[/b][/li]
[li]Complete combat [b]√[/b][/li]
[li]Make ALL skills work [b]X[/b][/li]
[/list]

[i]Current Skills (If there not listed, I havn&#39;t completed them yet)[/i]

[b]Agility[/b] (10 December 2009)
