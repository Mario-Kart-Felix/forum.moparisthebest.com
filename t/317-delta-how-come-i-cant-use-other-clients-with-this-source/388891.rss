    <title>[317] [Delta] How come I can&#39;t use other clients with this source?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-delta-how-come-i-cant-use-other-clients-with-this-source/388891</link>
    <description>Allright I tried to add skillcape emotes to a source I downloaded (Pk Jad Scape) but the only client so far working with this is the one I downloaded with it, I tried using it from Acrylicx, because that has nice looking :) and already had the 508 emote tab, but when ever I try to connect to server, it does connect, but immidiently disconnects me again.. I used several IP&#39;s, like 127.0.0.1/ localhost/ My IP in this wireless network, no-ip, my IP where NO-IP connects too.. but nothing seems to work.. Any ideas? please post!</description>
