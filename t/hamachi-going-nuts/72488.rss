    <description>kk, I think you know what the subject is about. So let&#39;s skip the intro :P

I have my own server, hamachi has always worked and boom, one day (maybe a week) my hamachi keep telling setting up and a huge pop up coems in saying &quot;Failed to configure Hamachi network adapter.

Configuration problem is most likely caused by your firewalling software 
blocking DHCP traffic on Hamachi adapter. Please make sure that UDP 
traffic from local port 68 to port 67 at 5.0.0.1 is allowed. Alternatively
you can try completely disabling the firewall on Hamachi adapter.

If neither of the above helps or you don&#39;t understand this message, visit 
our Support Forums, report the problem and you will get help.

Would you like for Hamachi to keep trying to configure the adapter while
you adjust your firewall settings ?&quot;

I am using Mcafee Securitycenter if that could help you people get the problem.

Thank you very much.</description>
