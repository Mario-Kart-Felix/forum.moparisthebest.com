    <title>Almost done portforwardding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/almost-done-portforwardding/342746</link>
    <description>Hi guys. I have been working on portforwarding for a while now, and I actually reached somewhere. But theres a problem

So, I used the port checker from portforward.com and it says that my port is open, although when I post my server on google, I get this message: We could not connect to your server. Are you sure it&#39;s online, and that you are not blocking connections from 217.23.15.196 ? 

Ok, and I also when to canyouseeme.org, I checked port 43594 and it&#39;s wrong. The reason it says is: connection refused.
I don&#39;t get it, the port checker tool works, and seeme.org doesnt. Even google doesn&#39;t work for me.

This is what I do. My server is called usmanpkz.no-ip.biz
I portforwarded pretty much like 200 times. Now I got the port checking tool saying: your port is open! 
But the downsides are that canyouseeme.org says that my connection is refused.
and google just gives a stupid message: We could not connect to your server. Are you sure it&#39;s online, and that you are not blocking connections from 217.23.15.196 ? 

Any help is appreciated for rep+  :)

EDIT:

alright, now it&#39;s getting even more wierd, when I click check port in port checker, it randomly either says your port is open, or your port is not open, or is unreachable

              <p>I think its kinda funny that your blocking out a simple IPv4 address… I’m at least hoping that’s your IPv4, but if it isn’t thats your problem.</p>
