    <title>Serious Question and help. Not Noobie :/</title>

    <description>Could someone please help me with my question and please give a decent answer 0_o

First of all I haven&#39;t found anything but unreadable client dumps on setAccessMask and runscript for a 508 server.
I used setconfig to move the red x on each of the pictures but I am unable to place images of the objects there and they
are not action buttons. In fact no packet is sent when clicked. I can&#39;t figure it out and on that note I would love if you could post
some links to where I can learn more about how the stream works as well as the functions within the frames.java. I would love to learn more
on this specifically. But any help is wanted =]]]]

btw this is interface 396 on bulby 508 server. The furniture creation interface.



Edit. Can someone please help. It also happened to my previously working interface 438. The client wont send the packet nor recognize the buttons</description>
