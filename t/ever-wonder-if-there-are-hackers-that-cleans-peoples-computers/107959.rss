    <description>Ever wonder if there are hackers that cleans peoples&#39; computers?

I don&#39;t know why, but I have thought of at least one person doing this. A sort of &#39;white-hat&#39; kind of hacker that has a script running, checking IPs, using common exploits to get into each one, and if it does get into it, then it runs a series of scripts to clean up shit and close open holes.  Then leaves discreetly and moves on to the next person. 

Just a little philosophy to discuss. :)

It would be pretty sick if someone did this and [i]then[/i] posted the script on the net for people to download. Anyone who has a clean computer could just download it and keep checking for exploitable computers and make the Internet safe from those jack ass hackers.</description>

<p>My friend recently bought wireless and I noticed the day it went up(Only connection I can get perfect signal on in my front room) and it was unprotected so I setup a network key and posted it though his door. Obviously not uber hacking but from what I can tell, you can do some major damage if you have access(witch I did(192.168.1.1, login: “admin” “password”)) to the router setup.</p>

<p>That’s bullshit. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
Of course they are fixable “from a remote location”, it’s just patching or replacing files over remote shell.<br>
And no, of course vendors wouldn’t EXPLOIT their own software (in order to patch it).</p>
<p>On topic: Yes, I believe some white hats who discover new critical bugs may out of interest exploit a bug and fix it.</p>

<p>I don’t know why, but I have thought of at least one person doing this. A sort of ‘white-hat’ kind of hacker that has a script running, checking IPs, using common exploits to get into each one, and if it does get into it, then it runs a series of scripts to clean up shit and close open holes.  Then leaves discreetly and moves on to the next person.</p>
<p>Just a little philosophy to discuss. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>It would be pretty sick if someone did this and <span class="bbcode-i">then</span> posted the script on the net for people to download. Anyone who has a clean computer could just download it and keep checking for exploitable computers and make the Internet safe from those jack ass hackers.</p>
