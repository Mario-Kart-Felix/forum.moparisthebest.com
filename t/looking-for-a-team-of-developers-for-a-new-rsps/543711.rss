[center][size=24pt][anchor=introduction]Introduction[/size]
I am currently in need of a team to work on a new private server, I have yet to come up with a name
For now, Im gathering a team, this team will consist of the following:
1x Server Manager
1x Website Designer/Developer
4x Moderators
3x Administrators
4x Forum Staff Members
3x Server Programmers/Coders
Any skill not mentioned here you can try to apply for (Please do not apply for in-game staff[Forum staff applications may be accepted])
I have yet to chose a suitable revision(s), I am thinking of either a 317, 562 or 718/742.
I might be hosting more than one revision at a time so I may need people who are able to handle 317 and someone else that can handle a 718/742.[/center]

Position applying for: Forum Moderator, due to limited time available - Moderator, for reasons below<br>
Past experience: Been playing RS for 10 years, RSPS for 5, Owned my own (unsuccessful) sevrer, Moderator on numerous smaller servers.<br>
Why do you want to apply for this position?: I love to integrate with a community, and make a difference within it, I feel that I have a very good influence on people and maybe I can make the difference in a large community. The reason for wanting the position is to ensure everyone feels like they are in a nice environment within the community and never feels threatened, and I think I could be the man to instigate, control and keep the community steady and loving for as long as possible. - Moderator for the same reasoning, I feel moderators have a large impact on a community and that it will be a lot easier in that position to help the community get a long with each other, obviously as the RSPS community can cause some online scuffles I feel as if I am very good in diffusing these issues quickly and remedying them so that both parties feel appeased.<br>
Hours available per day: When not in work 10+ hours (work 5-6 days a week) - When in work 3-6 hours. - Obviously varies due to other activities.</p>
<p>As a side note, The reason I would like to start in a position like this is that I feel very approachable to new players, and that new players always love to feel noticed and not as if they are just another new guy, and from that start I feel that I would be able to make a good impression for the server from day one.</p>
