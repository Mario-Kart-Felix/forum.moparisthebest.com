    <title>How would you defend a game from cheating?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-would-you-defend-a-game-from-cheating/257906</link>
    <description>i am days away from starting production on a game ive been designing. over 50 pages of design along with countless databases and formulas. 

My game is a webpage based game, similair to neopets, just not gay, and more like a runescape style version.


I have my own ideas of how to combat against cheating bastards like you.... and me....
but how would you stop macroers from cheating in an online webpage based game.

One suggestion that has been given to me is having a predetermind amount of actions. so the player can mine 15 trees or fish 15 fish before he needs to &#39;rest&#39; and enter a security password. This number of actions can be increased by training a skill specialy designed for actions. 

While i hate this idea with every fiber in my body, its the best suggestion ive got so far.</description>

              <p>well the way ive been thinking is</p>
<p>keep everything secret. every button, every variable, every form, is server side, and anything that is shown to the user, has a random name to it.</p>
<p>Also, every link just refreshes the page with different content, so noone can just type in <a href="http://www.thegame.com/trainfishing" rel="nofollow noopener">www.thegame.com/trainfishing</a><br>
since the only site would be <a href="http://www.thegame.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.thegame.com</a>, just with a different script every time</p>

i write profanities regardless of my state check my previous posts, but it seems ridiculous seeing as how you have a signature spot. Its there for a reason.</p>

<p>Your idea with the security code will probably just annoy players. If you cut trees and fish, then maybe you can put a captcha code everytime they attempt to bank them, but I don’t know if your game would have a banking feature or not.</p>

              <p>make a game based off of the cheating aspect that way you dont have an issue, you encourage players to write their own scripts to cheat the game and the better your cheat scripts the better you do in the game.

If you make the Captcha easy to solve for human, but hard for programs it would not be a problem.<br>
And 30 seconds are to often.</p>

<p>i was thinking either an action based system, based on your total skill level. every 10 skill levels or something gets you an extra point before you need to rest.</p>
<p>or, use the inventory sorta like runescape does. no gathering skills if your bag is full, etc.</p>

One suggestion that has been given to me is having a predetermind amount of actions. so the player can mine 15 trees or fish 15 fish before he needs to ‘rest’ and enter a security password. This number of actions can be increased by training a skill specialy designed for actions.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Runescape did that exact same thing, and it was beaten by cheaters rather easily.</p>
<p>I agree with most people here, make the game first, once you have content and an audience, then work on cheating.[/quote]<br>
Might actually be good to have a few people cheating at first. Get some highscores to beat.<br>
Encouragement.</p>
<p>Although, I <em>hate</em> text based games.</p>
