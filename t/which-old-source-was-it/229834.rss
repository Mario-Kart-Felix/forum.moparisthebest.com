    <title>Which old source was it?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-old-source-was-it/229834</link>
    <description>I remember an old source that was like this.

You spawn with a blue phat, verac brassy, drag legs, and a whip.
They had all of the commands (::starter ::barrows ::leet ::pker ) all of those.
I want this source really bad, what was it called?!?


I know you can code all of these in by yourself, but I don&#39;t know how to do that, anyone remember that source?</description>
