    <description>Okay. so im new to the whole 667 scene and i decided to try to use Matrix as a Base to learn it on. as it seemed the cleanest.
I have been working on it for a few weeks and i got alot of stuff scripted that wasn&#39;t scripted before.

I.E  Duel arena.
Pest control
and a lot of the shop NPC&#39;s that was easy.
But now i have the &quot; Donate to spawn Limitation i am dreading so much.
i know basics to the server as i owned a 317 A LOONG time ago.
back when zezima was top dog.
but now i just cant seem to figure out how to add donator status to my character.
i edited it and put me as Mod + admin.
But i cant spawn things still.

I dont want to remove the items from the donator list. as in a few weeks or so when i am done scripting. i want to host the source. &lt;of course giving 80% cred to matrix cause i used his source. but i can honestly say i have put in a ton of work to improve the server enough to say its deff not a leech.
i got the ring of dueling scripted. with all working tele&#39;s as well as  Glory&#39;s
as well as Karamja ship and Karamja island. + the volcano and the fight caves.
and i would estimate about 75% of all npc&#39;s spawned and scripted. 

And yet im too dumb to locate and figure out how to make myself a Donator on my server.

If Possible could someone assist me with it.

either that. or i don&#39;t want a donate system at all. but rather convert it to where only Mods And Admins can spawn things.
sadly the same thing. 
i dont know where the donator system stretches to and the commands for donations are hard to tell where they end.
Help =/

after a few weeks of this i got a head ache...

Stil working on a bit. =)  but im proud.

Thanks in advanced for any help guys,</description>

              <p>Okay, first of all to make yourself donator, you need to go in commands.java unless you have the stuff what is able to open a “.p” file, so as i was saying, you just go in commands.java and Search something like this <a>code</a>[/code]</p>
<p>Mine looks like this; <code>if (cmd[0].equalsIgnoreCase("permdonator")&amp;&amp; (player.getUsername().equalsIgnoreCase("Dylan"))) {</code></p>
<p>And there is a monthly donator command where it only makes them donator for 1 month, you can change this to any command you like unless you like that but i dont <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> And the monthly donator will be something like this,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>And if you do not want Donators to spawn items and just make it admin or whatever you want, you just change the Player rights it would be something like <code>player.isDonator(1))</code><br>
And all you would do is find the donator part and change with this;</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>then save and <span class="bbcode-b">Compile</span> and there you go.<br>
Have fun making your server hope you have fun <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
