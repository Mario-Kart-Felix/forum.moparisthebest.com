    <title>Someone help me develop my RSPS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/someone-help-me-develop-my-rsps/506560</link>
    <description>I have plenty of knowledge in coding and rsps development but i&#39;m now running on a whole new desktop and don&#39;t have all the stuff I had on recent. I also am running off a new router that doesn&#39;t allow portforwarding and it&#39;s been a struggle. I would like to get a server back up like I had before and i&#39;m in desperate help, if you can help me build my server back up etc. I will pay in either Paypal or RSGP.
