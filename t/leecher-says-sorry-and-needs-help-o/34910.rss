    <title>Leecher says sorry :( and needs help :O</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/leecher-says-sorry-and-needs-help-o/34910</link>
    <description>Hey guys, 

I have to be honest to you, I&#39;m a leecher. I&#39;ve leeched a lot of scripts on this forum for runescape.
BUT, lately, I&#39;m learning Visual Basics myself @ school and I&#39;ve been thinking about how you guys must be feeling if people would just grab your script, use it and wait till you update it without posting anything or something. Maybe saying thanks.

Now to say sorry, I&#39;ve browsed the runescape scripts forum a bit and I&#39;ve noticed there aren&#39;t a lot scripts that makes fire out of logs, so I thought I&#39;d start on that one (though it is a useless skill but, whatever).
I&#39;ve made a new account on the forum because the other one has the same name I use on runescape. Yes that&#39;s true, I have one account name wich has never been banned for macroïng and I thank you guys for that.

Now back to the firemaking script. I&#39;ve used Akuma&#39;s tutorial ([url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,10321.0.html]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,10321.0.html[/url]) about autominers to make this firemaker, but I can&#39;t get it to work.
The Problem is that it will put the mouse pointer in the top-left of the corner and clicks around there.
I also get this:
[code]
Error in BenMouse
Report: 0, -4 : 0, 1 : 15;
Error in BenMouse
Report: 0, -5 : 1, 0 : 15;
[/code]
Everytime it moves a little it prints that with other numbers as if it&#39;s printing the coörds. (except the 15, it never changes)

[scar]program Burninglogs;
{.include SRL/SRL.scar}

const logcolor= 3166569; //The color of the logs you want to burn
const boxcolor= 9474203; //The color of your tinderbox

procedure fireit;
begin
repeat
  findcolorspiral(x,y,boxcolor,3,3,515,336)
   mmouse(x,y,3,3)
      istextat2(9,9,&#39;Tinderbox&#39;,20)
      wait(random(1000))
      mouse(x,y,2,2,true)
  findcolorspiral(x,y,logcolor,3,3,515,336)
  mmouse(x,y,3,3)
    mouse(x,y,2,2,true)
until(false)
end;

begin
SetupSRL;
repeat
fireit;
until(false)
end.[/scar]
This is my script so far. I know it lacks anti-randoms, progress report and hell of a lot other stuff.
What will be my next step? And how can I get this to make it click the tinderbox, then the log.
Maybe later, I can make sure it will get the logs from a nearby bank or it will cut them from nearby trees.

I hope you guys forgive me for leeching and I hope you will accept me in this great community.

Greetz,

              <p>hey im really new to this too.  im writing my first script at this moment also.  but from what ive learned with tuts.  you have to save the image and open it as a bitmap by clicking picture to string.  then your debug box will tell you the name of the string or something.  and from there you can use your script to find it.  this is where im stuck on too with my script :(.<br>
i think it would look like this though.</p>
<p>FindBitmap(name of your bitmap,x,y);<br>
MoveMouse(x,y);<br>
or you could use<br>
MoveMouse(x+5,y+5);</p>
<p>if you wanted to click there.  I dont think all of this is right but i hoped it helped a little :).<br>
what im stuck on is converting the picture to bitmap.  if you know how to do that, then can you post here too?</p>
