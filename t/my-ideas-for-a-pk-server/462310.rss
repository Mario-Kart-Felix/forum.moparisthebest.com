    <title>My Ideas for a PK Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-ideas-for-a-pk-server/462310</link>
    <description>So normally I am into eco servers, but I had a general idea for a PK/Spawn server. I do think that the general idea, but this is my own unique taste. Feel free to use the idea anyone as I am not going to use it, just a good on. 

So normally people join PK servers to get the partyhats and look cool on the server. All those rares and the freedom to any item make them happy. However, what if you were to restrict certain items (which has been done for a long time) like dclaws and other strong weapons in the server, armour aswell. Whenever you are to kill anyone you get a certain amount of currency or points and use that currency to buy the things you can&#39;t spawn. 

It would be difficult to make it even, but you could make it time consuming but not that hard. Like 40 kills for Dclaws or something. To average it out so you know people set a short term goal that wont take weeks to get, just enough time for them to get what they want to pk and enjoy their time on the server. Just an idea guys,

              <p>Yes, they are essentially throwaway servers. I think for them to work long term, would require numerous, well written minigames, to show some effort was put in and therefore showing it would be worth a lot more sentimental value.</p>

              <p>I have had the same thoughts too, I am well into economic servers but it looks like the most popular seem to be high revision PK and/or spawn servers.</p>
<p>I like the idea of developing a spawn server to satisfy a lot of players needs. PKing is a fundamental aspect of any server, eco or not. What is hard to achieve is making in slightly different to every other spawn server. I find that spawn servers are generally treated with less respect than economy servers because a lot less effort goes into player growth. It is essentially who has the most PK points. That’s it.</p>
<p>There’s needs to be something else. You could make skilling slow and economic by restricting resources from being spawned, but then why would someone initially join a spawn server to skill?</p>

              <p>i’ve never seen this in a PK server before. (where have I been! :|)<br>
anyways, I like this idea, it’s more fun and yet, still challenging. i have seen systems similar to this, such as after a player reaches (lets say 50 kills) they receive a yellow phat in their inventory.</p>
<p>I also like the degrading idea.</p>

              <p>But then to limit the server, you could give an item a certain amount of energy and kind of like barrows items, it could degrade. And you woulden’t be able to buy another thing until it totally degrades. Kind of adds to that competitive feel.</p>
