    <title>Is Paypal Good to Use for Donations?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-paypal-good-to-use-for-donations/407337</link>
    <description>Hello,

Should I verify my Paypal to receive donations? Is Paypal worth it? I&#39;ve heard pretty bad stories with people using Paypal, but I don&#39;t know an alternate and universal way to receive donations.  If you guys know a safer, and equally or more effective way to set up a donating process, please share your opinions! 


TheCyberMan


P.S. Are there other ways for people to verify their Paypal who don&#39;t want to give their bank account info and don&#39;t have a credit card?</description>

Dear PayPal, its customers, and our friends around the globe,</p>
<p>This is an official communiqué from Anonymous and Lulz Security in the name of AntiSec.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, we’ve found ourselves outraged at the FBI’s willingness to arrest and threaten those who are involved in ethical, modern cyber operations. Law enforcement continues to push its ridiculous rules upon us - Anonymous “suspects” may face a fine of up to 500,000 USD with the addition of 15 years’ jailtime, all for taking part in a historical activist movement. Many of the already-apprehended Anons are being charged with taking part in DDoS attacks against corrupt and greedy organizations, such as PayPal.</p>
<p>What the FBI needs to learn is that there is a vast difference between adding one’s voice to a chorus and digital sit-in with Low Orbit Ion Cannon, and controlling a large botnet of infected computers. And yet both of these are punishable with exactly the same fine and sentence.</p>
<p>In addition to this horrific law enforcement incompetence, PayPal continues to withhold funds from WikiLeaks, a beacon of truth in these dark times. By simply standing up for ourselves and uniting the people, PayPal still sees it fit to wash its hands of any blame, and instead encourages and assists law enforcement to hunt down participants in the AntiSec movement.</p>
<p>Quite simply, we, the people, are disgusted with these injustices. We will not sit down and let ourselves be trampled upon by any corporation or government. We are not scared of you, and that is something for you to be scared of. We are not the terrorists here: you are.</p>
<p>We encourage anyone using PayPal to immediately close their accounts and consider an alternative. The first step to being truly free is not putting one’s trust into a company that freezes accounts when it feels like, or when it is pressured by the U.S. government. PayPal’s willingness to fold to legislation should be proof enough that they don’t deserve the customers they get. They do not deserve your business, and they do not deserve your respect.</p>
<p>Join us in our latest operation against PayPal - tweet pictures of your account closure, tell us on IRC, spread the word. Anonymous has become a powerful channel of information, and unlike the governments of the world, we are here to fight for you. Always.</p>
<p>Signed, your allies,</p>
<p>Lulz Security (unvanned)<br>
Anonymous (unknown)<br>
AntiSec (untouchable)<br>
[/quote][/quote] That is some scary radicalism…</p>

<p>Ehm not sure, never had a payment through it. I think you can use any card and its not essential to have a card as you can go to one of there shop’s or receive payment to your sim card as credit.</p>

Use western union, make a page on your website explaining what details to input and how to do so. Yes, it may not be as good but you know your money is safe.<br>
Or get a prepaid card and they can send money to your prepaid card.</p>

<p>In all likenesses PayPal probably wont be around much longer, there becoming the MySpace of Payment sites, their stocks are dropping and multiple lawsuits are being pressed agents them. This is a good time to support the smaller sites and help them grow!</p>

              <p>No, no, no, no, a million times no and heres a few reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>Paypal caves in to every little threat they get from anyone, your account could be closed and non of your money refunded just cause some random kid said you might have scammed $2 from him.</li>
<li>At least 5 hacking clans are plotting to DDOS Paypal till they allow Wiki leeks to get funding from donations VIA their services.</li>
<li>Random fee’s will pop up, last month I got a $20 fee on mine for not using my account for 6 weeks because apparently business level accounts must be used once a month.</li>
</ol>
<p>In my opinion go with Alert pay. It’s cheep, they don’t steal your money, and your customers wont be able to screw you over by requesting their money back.</p>

              <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Should I verify my Paypal to receive donations? Is Paypal worth it? I’ve heard pretty bad stories with people using Paypal, but I don’t know an alternate and universal way to receive donations.  If you guys know a safer, and equally or more effective way to set up a donating process, please share your opinions!</p>
<p>TheCyberMan</p>
<p>P.S. Are there other ways for people to verify their Paypal who don’t want to give their bank account info and don’t have a credit card?</p>
