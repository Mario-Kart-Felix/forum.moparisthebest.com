    <title>Can&#39;t write data to my external HD</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-write-data-to-my-external-hd/284197</link>
    <description>Well.. Sadly I let it drop, while it was on, and it made a weird noise. I picked it up and reconnected it and tried to transfer something... It wasn&#39;t writing anything to it and it took a while for a message to pop up saying &quot;the file your trying to copy isn&#39;t in that location anymore&quot;.. And even after that, sometimes when I try to explore the drive, it says &quot;This folder is empty.&quot; yet it still says there&#39;s 531mb left of 372gb.

Sometimes when I connect it now, it says the drive is there, other times it doesn&#39;t. I just tried copying a txt file and it worked fine but when trying to copy an AVI file (approx. 230mb) it just does that &quot;the file your trying to copy isn&#39;t in that location anymore&quot; bit and takes ages to load. (aka freezes my explorer.exe)

<p>I put it in my computer and it actually seems to work fine! I transferred my Weeds episode in a few seconds… the only problem is the SATA cable is about 2 inches long… so I don’t know where I can mount it to keep it in my computer :S</p>

<p>Place it on the bottom of the case. You damaged the converter by the way.</p>
