    <title>Why its time to say goodbye</title>

    <description>[b]Intro:[/b]
I&#39;m sorry guys but it is time to say goodbye to game maker. As painful as it is for me to say that I have to.

[b]How it began[/b]
This is what happened. I recently purchased GameMaker 8.1 Standard, and I loved it. Its extremely fast, powerful, and still good ol&#39; game maker. Today, however, it crashed on me. I thought it was just because I was running too many things at once. So I closed everything and tried to re-open it. When I did so I got a strange error stating this: GM error code 68262. Every time I tried to open it I would get this message. Since I had the verification codes I simply uninstalled and re-installed it again. Once that was done I tried opening it once more. Again I got the error code. So I contacted the GM support staff and apparently I am not the first to receive this message. The said it has something to do with the reading between game maker and my computer and because of the error code It sends a message to the GM servers that do the updates or whatever for gamemaker and registered mine as a &quot;no pro&quot; what this means is that because of their mistake I am no longer able to have GameMaker on my computer! So now I am learning a new language called FreeBasic. Its actually quite powerful. I was amazed at how simple it is too.

[b]Closing Notes[/b]
I guess I&#39;m disappointed, but hey now I get to learn something new :)

NOTE: And yes they refunded my money to me.</description>

              <p>Just purchased DB Pro and Im very pleased. The programming is awesome and easy to understand, Its amazingly powerful, Blizzard Entertainment uses it for WoW so you know its reliable. I still have to get used to it a little but its actually pretty similar to GML in its own kinda way. Anyways there is no Drag and Drop so people cant say its not programming anymore lol</p>

Well I was googleing stuff right now and I saw Eclipse. Is that pretty good? And would darkbasic pro be worth getting?<br>

Eclipse is an IDE. I would say yes… I don’t know how much it costs as I got mine in '07. Created simple text based programs as I didn’t know anything about programming and was in 5th grade or somewhat.[/quote]I just youtubed them both Eclipse looks ok but DarkBasic looks amazing.
