    <description>Okay well I have noticed that  a good portion of the board has  100 plus reputation. ( those who are active etc etc ) 

I have a few suggestions to help...gain some respect back to the reputation system.

-Allow those who are listed as &quot;moparians&quot; be the only people allowed to de-rep ( as we are the most active anyway ) 
- change the de-rep system some, make it so it depends on your  rep.  If you have 200 rep I am suggesting your able to de-rep up to  5-6 reputation points. 
-decrease the  reputation from  13 for max down to 9-10 ( lower others as needed ) 
-PERHAPS a rep reset?  
-if it&#39;s actually possible ( I have been told before that 200 is impossible to change )  change it to like 1k. 

So...then it would be more realistic. 

another idea which I am not really fond of personally is making it so reputation can only be given in specific boards such as, server tutorials etc</description>

              <p>I agree with Si on all accounts here. We aren’t going to solve the rep issue simply by retrying what we’ve already done. A reset just holds off the issue and altering the parameters just reconfigures the end result, not the underlying problem. The problem is how the system is used by the members of this site. They don’t treat it as a way of showing a member is excellent in this community. At least, not in the way that was intended.</p>

<p>As for the  de-rep.  I am thinking of it  as more of a “respected” member  type of  reward. But yeah I do agree everyone has a right to an opinion.</p>

              <p>Why shouldn’t the groups below moparian’s be allowed to derep people? They have opinions too and if a Moparian deserves rep-- (which they occasionally do) then they deserve to give it to them. Not that it even matters either, since people always get their rep restored to 200 within a few hours.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/rep">@rep</a> reset - It’s pointless and has happened before. It’s not a permanent solution to the problem.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/rep">@rep</a> cap - I’m pretty sure it’s possible to change, but as I said above, it’s not a permanent solution to the problem. Raising the cap would just delay people from eventually getting that. It wouldn’t be a particularly hard achievement to get with the way people throw reputation around on this website. The system isn’t the problem here, it’s the people who use it.</p>
