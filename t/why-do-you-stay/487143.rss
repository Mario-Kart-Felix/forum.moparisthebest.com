    <title>Why do you stay?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-do-you-stay/487143</link>
    <description>I&#39;m curious. I&#39;ve been through many phases with this community starting from playing RSPS, to trying to model and program myself, to playing minecraft, to just staying to the general sections.

Basically, everyone has their reason for staying and that reason changes over time. What&#39;s yours?

              <p>I’ve been in the ‘scene’ since it was just a little baby. It’s nice watching it grow and I don’t believe I’ll ever fully leave.</p>
<p>My reasons did change throughout my time though:</p>
<ul>
<li>Originially it was to gain an unfair advantage when playing Runescape.</li>
<li>My interests then turned to programming and I reached the goals that I had set out for myself.</li>
<li>I slowly grew tired if this and found that I was great at the politics side of things. As well as this, Kait allowed me to write a few news stories for his news section and I really loved the reach.</li>
<li>My love for programming was revived when I met psb and semaphore. This was also around the time when I left here to develop WoW private servers. I become fairly well known, developing for one of the leading private servers at the time. I also gained a staff position as Sythe.</li>
<li>I was stripped of all my positions and I have gave up programming. It just grew stale.</li>
<li>My interests now? Mobile technology, public relations and WoW. I’m also with a great girl and my social life is excellent. I went through a crazy period of being single. Ask jorsa, he experienced a night out with me earlier this year. Great lad. I’m currently on a six figure pay but I’m soon giving that up to study again.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all over the course of many years. Now I remain here, just to watch over the community. The scene has changed dramatically. It seems that private servers have taken over (something that doesn’t interest me in the slightest). Less importance has been places on the actual ‘cheating’.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should have left long ago. I mean, ive been here since the beggining. not Mioar, the entire scene. the engine behind the numbers. I no longer hold any power, newcomers don’t recognise me at all (the member-base has changed so much) and I can no longer impact the community positively. I still do mentor a few members here though. I’ve been inactive in IRC for a huge amount of time and I don’t intend to ever really return to it. Runescape? I haven’t played since I first entered the scene.</p>
<p>Before I leave however (whenever that may be), I plan on writing my own version of the black books. A detailed history of the scene which will include little known facts and occurances. I may also release my private works and notes that will aid future developers. Included will be the story of how I lost thousands in the attempted acquisition of a well known community, secret logs that show the real side of admins on various sites from the past and present and the secret deals that have ended up rather profitable.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I love this community. I love the scene. I may be rough on you all but its really for your own good. Heck, I een feel guilty sometimes when i read back in ny posts. It’s my baby. Sadly though, the scene has grown up. They no longer visit me or even remember who I am sometimes. I can’t give them life advice and they wouldn’t value it anyway. It is sad. However, I believe I’ve insulted some good qualities in select members. I believe I’ve pulled strings and improved the community. I guess I am power hungry.</p>
<p>My works are done in the shadows. That’s where I’ll remain, until I fade into darkness.</p>
<p>Edit: Apologies for the terrible spelling and grammar in this post, I typed it all on an iPhone at 4am.</p>

More or less the same as Newty. I’m widely known here and not just throughout the moparscape community, by using the IRC I’ve become acquainted with a lot of the remaining mitb members. I don’t like being the new guy in places, I’d much rather be in a place where I know people and people know me, seems more appealing :P.<br>

I have to start getting on the IRC, I just hate it D: but it makes you feel more welcome.[/quote]<br>
I didn’t like the IRC to begin with, but it grows on you. Now I use IRC more than other forms of communication such as Skype etc.</p>
