    <description>I recently had a Science test, a question has been bothering me. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;What substance does magnesium + hydrochloric acid make?&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

My formula was: 
[code]hydrochloric acid + magnesium -&gt; hydrogen + magnesium chloride[/code]
hydrochloric acid + magnesium being the products if anyone doesn&#39;t understand
hydrogen + magnesium chloride being the reactants.

To make sure it contained hydrogen I concluded a &#39;pop&#39; test, it worked. Now the substance people tell me it makes is hydrogen, however my answer was magnesium chloride. Am I right or am I wrong?
Can someone please explain.</description>
