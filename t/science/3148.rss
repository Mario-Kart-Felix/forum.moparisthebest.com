    <description>I need some help.

QUESTION #1
A guy dropped a coing that weights 1 gram from the eiffel tower. The height that the guy was at was 120meters. What &quot;position&quot; energy did the coing have after falling 80 meters? 

I also want the coins &quot;moving&quot; energy after 80 meters.

QUESTION #2

You are a slave at Keops pyramid and with help with a spear you are going to move a stoneblock that weights 500kg. Bescribe one exampel how tall the spear should be to be able to move the stoneblock. Do it from a senseibal force that you personally could do.</description>

              <p>QUESTION <span class="hashtag">#1</span><br>
A guy dropped a coing that weights 1 gram from the eiffel tower. The height that the guy was at was 120meters. What “position” energy did the coing have after falling 80 meters?</p>
<p>I also want the coins “moving” energy after 80 meters.</p>
<p>Ok this sounds like some basic physics stuff.  Here goes:<br>
If you want to find position and moving energies, you are looking for gravitational potential energy (PE = mgh) and kinetic energy (KE = (1/2)mv^2) respectively.</p>
<p>Throughout the entire process, no energy must be lost or gained, therefore, the inital gravitational potential energy (at the top of the tower) equals the final kinetic energy just before the coin hits the ground:<br>
mgh = (1/2)mv^2</p>
<p>Ok, here’s the initial position energy of the coin:<br>
Variables: m = .01 kg (converting grams to kilograms)<br>
g = 9.81 m/s^2 (acceleration due to gravity)<br>
h = 120 m<br>
PE = mgh<br>
PE = .001kg * 9.81 m/s^2 * 120 m<br>
PE (initial) = 1.1772 Joules</p>
<p>After falling 80 meters, the height is now 40 meters:<br>
PE = mgh<br>
PE = .001kg * 9.81m/s^2 * 40 m<br>
PE (after 80m) = .3924 J (answer to first part)</p>
<p>After falling 80 meters, the coin has both position energy and moving energy and the sum of the two is equal to the initial position energy:<br>
PE (initial) = PE (after 80m) + KE (after 80m)<br>
Therefore: KE (after 80m) = PE (initial) - PE (after 80m)<br>
KE = 1.1772 - .3924 J<br>
KE = .7848 J (answer to second part)</p>
<p>QUESTION <span class="hashtag">#2</span></p>
<p>I’m not exactly sure about this one, but I think it might be a torque problem.<br>
Torque = force * distance(perpendicular)<br>
Torque is equal to the force times the distance away from the fulcrum that the force is applied.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure you can figure this one out yourself.  If you have the block on one end really close to the fulcrum and a force on the other side of the fulcrum that has a larger distance, the two sides will end up being in equilibrium.  If you apply just a little more force to one side, you can cause the other to move.</p>
<p>I can clarify this a little more if you need it.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
