              <p>There are hyperthermophillic archae that live at up to 121 degrees i think  nanoarchaeota of this type i will check my notes for you later. As for a minimum temperature psychrophiles can thrive at temperatures as low as about -10, they ahve an optimum at around 0, they are generally methanogenic worms.</p>

              <p>Life is kinda vague.  The range for human/mammal life is around -10°C to roughly 50°C (that’s my approximation, obviously without any external life-assistance).</p>
<p>For the evolution of life based on organic compounds, you would need a highly specific situation.  Presumably, the atmosphere would be composed of high levels of methane, ammonia, and hydrogen with NO oxygen.  Ranging storms (with much energy introduced into the atmosphere through lightening) would be needed to form the organic compounds, and liquid water oceans would be needed for the creation of a lipid bilayer for cells.  But that’s probably not what you want.</p>
<p>Life can survive in very extreme situations.  For instance, looking at the ocean, you have sea creatures that can handle the extreme cold over below freezing temperatures, 0°C and high pressure &amp; CO2 levels at the ocean floor (at higher pressures, water freezes at lower temperatures).  Just a little bit away though, you have microbes and bacteria that survive through chemosynthesis at hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, which can reach up to 100°C.</p>
<p>That’s probably the max temperature range of life (as we know it) survival…</p>
