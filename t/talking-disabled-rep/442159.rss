    <title>Talking Disabled? Rep++</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/talking-disabled-rep/442159</link>
    <description>So I posted this in the Server Help section. Then, I found out that this was a client sided issue, so I&#39;m posting it here also.
In tutorial island, I guess talking is disabled? It&#39;s almost like everybody is muted. I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve never heard of that but I have no idea on how to approach enabling it. Anyone have any ideas? I will rep.</description>
