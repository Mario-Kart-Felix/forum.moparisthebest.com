    <title>Hey</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hey/335163</link>
    <description>So i am currently using SyscapeV.3 and it works good but it is a 525 and if anyone logs into my server its all glitched up to them. (to me it seems perfect) And if they download the client i have there is no place to type in the IP so can anybody link me to a client that works with a 525 that is not MASSIVE that will allow people to play not all glitched up??

And how do i fix Ancient Magics?????</description>
