    <title>If statement not executing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/if-statement-not-executing/420874</link>
    <description>Hey guys. I currently have a problem with an if statement not executing, even though the condition is true.

[code]			while (index &lt; 100 &amp;&amp; index &lt; size) {
				String amount = xpList.get(index).toString();
				System.out.println(amount+&quot;a&quot;);
				System.out.println(XP+&quot;a&quot;);
				if (amount == XP) {
					System.out.println(&quot;test&quot;);
					int rank = index+1;
				}
				while (index2 &lt; 100 &amp;&amp; index2 &lt; size) {
					String matchName = scoreList.get(index2).toString();
					if (matchName.startsWith(amount)) {
						writeLog(matchName, &quot;scores2&quot;);
						//finalList.add(matchName)
					}
					index2++;
				}
				index++;
			}[/code]

The if statement which has the condition that amount == XP does no execute even though they are matching. To test this I even printed output statements to double check they were the same. I even added an &quot;a&quot; on the end to ensure that there is no whitespace which is making them not match. The condition seems to be true yet the if statement is not executing.

All help is appreciated. Thank. :)</description>
