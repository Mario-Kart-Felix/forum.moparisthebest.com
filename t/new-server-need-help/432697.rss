    <description>okay me and my friend have decided that we would like to make my own runescape private server. i know some people they try and make it by there self and see how far they can get. but him and myself are a bit different i do not everything this is to know about rsps but i am computer smart. ive coding for about a year.

the server we&#39;re thinking about using is 602/562 http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,532916.0.html theres the link. but heres what we need 1admin, and 3mods. so any that helps us create this server and depending on how much work you put into helping with server will determen the rank you get, if you have any questions ask me on skype zwolvez or i.seesirens</description>
