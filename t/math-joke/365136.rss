See david. Can’t you go into a single topic these days without starting a pointless &amp; stupid argument. It seems it’s also very often with jc aswell…<br>
[/quote]It was more like a discussion about curriculum, which I admit was off-topic. The ‘argument’ started when he said that he thought I wouldn’t understand the joke.</p>
<p>And to be honest, that post you just made was off-topic and a potential argument starter too :P[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes, it was an argument. You continually retort to every single person who opposes you in any way, hence why people say all you do is argue. It’s not an opinion, it’s a fact. Frankly, your arguments are usually off-topic too, so I wouldn’t see you retaining your posting abilities for long on this forum if you continue them. It’s fine to share an opinion and defend it, but there’s a line and you shouldn’t be crossing it. The line is generally when the topic is being derailed or when personal attacks start coming out.</p>
<p>As for that math proof you posted, I think it’s a relation to 2 + 2 = 5, in which case the argument is you can’t divide by 0. Sorry for spoiling it, but the people above this post should be baffled for a while anyway. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Here’s one:</p>
<p>We have two variables a and b. they are equal to eachother:</p>
<p>a = b - Two variables set equal to eachother<br>
a + 5a = 5a + b  -<span class="bbcode-i"> Add 5a to both sides</span><br>
6a = 5a + b  <span class="bbcode-i">- Combine like terms</span><br>
6a - 6b = 5a + b - 6b  <span class="bbcode-i">- Subtract 6b from each</span><br>
6(a - b) = 5a + b - 6b <span class="bbcode-i">- Factor</span><br>
6(a - b) = 5a - 5b <span class="bbcode-i">- Combine like terms</span><br>
6(a - b) = 5(a - b) <span class="bbcode-i">- Factor</span><br>
6 = 5<span class="bbcode-i"> - Divide by (a-b)</span></p>
<p>For the people that understand the basic logic, don’t ruin it for others![/quote]<br>
I’m pretty sure the number needs to be positive on one side and negative on the other…</p>

<p>Speaking of them, the one Davidi2 brought up is my favorite to date, so I found it :P:</p>

You just need to know the stuff and skip.[/quote]They didn’t give us any of those options… I asked for Geo in 7th grade (because I had taken algebra already) and they said that it wasn’t possible… I’m guessing our districts just run differently.</p>

Actually there is no ‘limit’ to what classes you can take each year in high school, even if your district has a ‘curriculum’ (lolol). You can skip classes if you’re smart enough and can pass the final exam (lolol).</p>
