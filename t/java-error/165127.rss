    <description>Well i was editing some things on my server.
After words i decided to post it up.
but i had to redo the *how to make a server guide* because the server status page said i was offline.
then when i tried to run the server it would pop out then back out super fast.
Then i tryed to open my silbv5 client and it got an error saying

` java` is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
press any key to continue . . .


and so i think that was the same error it got when i tried to run the server.
main question is.. How do i get my server running again?
Any help would be greatly appreciated=D
Thanks again.
