    <title>Development Contest Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/development-contest-questions/438095</link>
    <description>Hey guys. I&#39;ve seen that Budda recently won the game development competition. Back in 07 and 08 I started making private servers. Including the original and popular Alcazar server and failed AlcazarOnline MMORPG. Since then I have become a much more proficient programmer in Java, Python, and C. I&#39;m currently creating a new private server called Embattled, however I just gained knowledge of this game making contests. I will keep developing my server, however I am also interested in the next contest. I was wondering:

1. When is it? 
2. What is the time frame in which it can be developed?
3. Is there an assigned theme?
4. Can development be started now? 
5. Can I don&#39;t plan on using any pre-existing bases or anything, I will start from scratch. Will that give me an advantage over others?

All help is appreciated. Thank you. :)</description>

              <p>Thanks for the reply Silabsoft. Was wondering are your forums still running. I’d have probably lost my moderation long ago due to inactivity. My name was Alcazar. What are you up to now days?</p>
