    <title>InsidiaX 2 Client problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/insidiax-2-client-problem/437192</link>
    <description>[b]Hey well i have a problem.

I am using the InsidiaX 2 Source and i have made a webclient with the InsidaX Client too.

1. Me and One other person have tried playing the webclient and the cache has downloaded fine, But 2 other people say they get the
&#39;Error Click for Detail&#39;s&#39; Error.. So what&#39;s the problem?

2. The Person who COULD download the cache via webclient cannot connect &amp; he gets &#39;Error logging in&#39;. 

I have made sure the IP in the Gui &amp; The client folder are my No-Ip. So i don&#39;t see reason whats stopping him from connecting.

You cannot change the IP in the server folder from what i&#39;v seen..

Can anyone help please?[/b]</description>
