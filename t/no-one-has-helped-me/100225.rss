    <description>ok there was a guy named The Guardian....he made a walkthrough that tells you how to make your server and code it,which can be found here&gt;&gt; http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,134771.0.html   anyways i followed it and it says when you click runserver.bat it should say &quot;Starting pimpscape on 0.0.0.0 43594....mine says 5555...then it says to type in localhost for the server on mopar, so i do this and it says error connecting to server must be down....i think the whole 5555 thing may be the prob. if its not then can someone tell me what the prob is and how to fix it?

              <p>If you wish to change your port , follow this :</p>
<p>[quote=“spon80”]first go into server.java and search for somthing like this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public static int serverlistenerPort = 5555;</code></pre>
<p>then change 5555 to 43594 complie,and run.<br>
and u dont really need to fix this insted on using port 43594 u go into (on mopar) file. port. then type in 5555.[/quote]</p>

              <p>well wen it says “starting pimpscape at 0.0.0.0:5555” that doesnt mean you server ip is 0.0.0.0 basically it mean that the server has started up on your computer. The ip of your server is the ip of your computer.</p>
<p>If you do that and it still doesnt work, then you probably didnt forward your port</p>
