    <title>HashList anyone?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hashlist-anyone/232003</link>
    <description>Since my time of learning how to use the java.util.List Collection utility, I have mainly used ArrayList. ArrayList is one of the fastest List collections and is supposed to represent a mutable generic object array. Well, I recently looked through the code of ArrayList, and I didn&#39;t like what I saw. I thought they did a very horrible way of handling and finding objects inside their code, so I set out to design my own List implementation whose processing speeds could compete with that of ArrayList&#39;s.

I started this list a few days ago, and finished only recently (yesterday or two days ago). I have tested it up against ArrayList, and it has surpassed the speeds tremendously. I could not believe my eyes when I saw the test results, so I went out and checked my code over and over again. Usually when something like this happens unexpectedly, there is usually a failing bug in the background. I tested my list so thoroughly that I found no bugs whatsoever.

Now, getting past the introduction. This list, as its name and the title of this topic imply, is built upon a hash framework. The list gains the hash&#39;d value of an object being entered into the array, and then stored it perfectly mapped against its respective object. This way, when searching the list for an object, it searches against the hash value of the object instead of the object itself. This was the original idea of the list, and the idea which was successfully implemented inside this new list construction.

I built a small test class (source code can be seen at the bottom of this post) that tested my hash list against an array list. The results were spectacular. I tested my list implementation against array list with 100 objects, 1000 objects, 10,000 objects, and 100,000 objects. The types of objects I tested were both doubles and Strings. Strings are a lot slower for my list, because their hashcode() method is much more expensive. Anyway, the following are the results for each list, for each number of objects:

[quote=&quot;Test of 100 objects&quot;]Processing ArrayList with 100 Strings: filled in 0ms, iterated in 0ms, indexed find in 1ms, cleared list in 0ms

[quote=&quot;Test of 10,000 objects&quot;]Processing ArrayList with 10000 Strings: filled in 24ms, iterated in 5ms, indexed find in 1557ms, cleared list in 1ms
Processing ArrayList with 10000 Doubles: filled in 4ms, iterated in 3ms, indexed find in 1887ms, cleared list in 1ms
Processing HashList with 10000 Strings: filled in 15ms, iterated in 2ms, indexed find in 203ms, cleared list in 0ms
Processing HashList with 10000 Doubles: filled in 4ms, iterated in 2ms, indexed find in 168ms, cleared list in 0ms[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Test of 100,000 objects&quot;]Processing ArrayList with 100000 Strings: filled in 153ms, iterated in 14ms, indexed find in -1ms, cleared list in 3ms
Processing ArrayList with 100000 Doubles: filled in 23ms, iterated in 10ms, indexed find in -1ms, cleared list in 2ms
Processing HashList with 100000 Strings: filled in 99ms, iterated in 59ms, indexed find in 17471ms, cleared list in 0ms
Processing HashList with 100000 Doubles: filled in 23ms, iterated in 7ms, indexed find in 17425ms, cleared list in 0ms[/quote]

As you can clearly see, my list tops array list in high fields, but suffers in lower fields. It shouldn&#39;t beat arraylist especially in the add() method, because it must calculate the hash value where arraylist simply adds the object. My list tops especially in the indexing field, considering that is the base of this entire list (the searching for objects).

Alright, time to get beyond the performance testing and purpose. The following is a link to a pastebin which contains the code for the HashList class (since the code itself is greater than 20,000 characters, the limit of posts on mopar):

http://col.telenubby.info/pastebin.php?show=8

The following is the code I used to test the performance of HashList against ArrayList:

[code]
import java.util.*;

public class Test {

	private static int len = 100;

	public static final void main(String[] args) {
		ArrayList&lt;String&gt; arrayListStr = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
		ArrayList&lt;Double&gt; arrayListDbl = new ArrayList&lt;Double&gt;();

		HashList&lt;String&gt; hashListStr = new HashList&lt;String&gt;();
		HashList&lt;Double&gt; hashListDbl = new HashList&lt;Double&gt;();

		long l1 = timeListStringFill(arrayListStr);
		long l2 = timeListStringGet(arrayListStr);
		long l3 = timeListStringIndexFind(arrayListStr);
		long l4 = timeListClear(arrayListStr);
		System.out.println(&quot;Processing ArrayList with &quot;+len+&quot; Strings: filled &quot;+
				&quot;in &quot;+l1+&quot;ms, iterated in &quot;+l2+&quot;ms, indexed find in &quot;+l3+&quot;ms, &quot;+
				&quot;cleared list in &quot;+l4+&quot;ms&quot;);
		
		arrayListStr = null;
		System.gc();

		long l5 = timeListDoubleFill(arrayListDbl);
		long l6 = timeListDoubleGet(arrayListDbl);
		long l7 = timeListDoubleIndexFind(arrayListDbl);
		long l8 = timeListClear(arrayListDbl);
		System.out.println(&quot;Processing ArrayList with &quot;+len+&quot; Doubles: filled &quot;+
				&quot;in &quot;+l5+&quot;ms, iterated in &quot;+l6+&quot;ms, indexed find in &quot;+l7+&quot;ms, &quot;+
				&quot;cleared list in &quot;+l8+&quot;ms&quot;);
		
		arrayListDbl = null;
		System.gc();
		
		long h1 = timeListStringFill(hashListStr);
		long h2 = timeListStringGet(hashListStr);
		long h3 = timeListStringIndexFind(hashListStr);
		long h4 = timeListClear(hashListStr);
		System.out.println(&quot;Processing HashList with &quot;+len+&quot; Strings: filled &quot;+
				&quot;in &quot;+h1+&quot;ms, iterated in &quot;+h2+&quot;ms, indexed find in &quot;+h3+&quot;ms, &quot;+
				&quot;cleared list in &quot;+h4+&quot;ms&quot;);
		
		hashListStr = null;
		System.gc();
		
		long h5 = timeListDoubleFill(hashListDbl);
		long h6 = timeListDoubleGet(hashListDbl);
		long h7 = timeListDoubleIndexFind(hashListDbl);
		long h8 = timeListClear(hashListDbl);
		System.out.println(&quot;Processing HashList with &quot;+len+&quot; Doubles: filled &quot;+
				&quot;in &quot;+h5+&quot;ms, iterated in &quot;+h6+&quot;ms, indexed find in &quot;+h7+&quot;ms, &quot;+
				&quot;cleared list in &quot;+h8+&quot;ms&quot;);
	}

	private static final long timeListStringFill(List&lt;String&gt; list) {
		long l = System.currentTimeMillis();
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; len; i++)
			list.add(i + &quot;&quot;);
		return System.currentTimeMillis() - l;
	}

	private static final long timeListDoubleFill(List&lt;Double&gt; list) {
		long l = System.currentTimeMillis();
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; len; i++)
			list.add((double)i);
		return System.currentTimeMillis() - l;
	}

	private static final long timeListClear(List&lt;?&gt; list) {
		long l = System.currentTimeMillis();
		list.clear();
		return System.currentTimeMillis() - l;
	}

	private static final long timeListStringIndexFind(List&lt;String&gt; list) {
		long l = System.currentTimeMillis();
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; len; i++)
			list.indexOf(i + &quot;&quot;);
		return System.currentTimeMillis() - l;
	}

	private static final long timeListDoubleIndexFind(List&lt;Double&gt; list) {
		long l = System.currentTimeMillis();
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; len; i++)
			list.indexOf((double)i);
		return System.currentTimeMillis() - l;
	}

	private static final long timeListStringGet(List&lt;String&gt; list) {
		long l = System.currentTimeMillis();
		for (String s : list);
		return System.currentTimeMillis() - l;
	}

	private static final long timeListDoubleGet(List&lt;Double&gt; list) {
		long l = System.currentTimeMillis();
		for (double d : list);
		return System.currentTimeMillis() - l;
	}
}

[/code]

Well, that&#39;s all of it. I don&#39;t know the practicality of using this HashList over ArrayList, but I know I will be using it for heavy operations which may use more than 10,000 objects (in which case, array list would be epic failure just from calling a simple contains() method).

Pleas leave some feedback, as I know this class is much more epic than the last generic class I posted and actually works. I wouldn&#39;t have posted it on mopar unless I wanted some sort of constructive criticism. Thanks, and have a good day (or better, if you are already having a bad one ;)).</description>

<p>I tried implementing the binary search algorithm for searching instead of linear, but it breaks because the hash table isn’t sorted. I was going to add notes about that. If one were to modify the list to add the elements in a sorted-by-hash fashion, then a binary algorithm could be implemented.</p>

<p>You are either ignorant or did not read my first post. And, if you didn’t read my first post, I’d like to know why you are posting.</p>
<p>Yes, I tested it just now and found the same error. I fixed it easily by modifying indexOf() and lastIndexOf() to iterate one less than currentOffset, since currentOffset is the position of the next entry.</p>
<p>And, my class remains a list. A list is an array of stored objects. Since my class stores objects, it is a list. One little bug does not make it anything less, especially when it was just fixed.</p>
<p>And finally, I would like to know why you have gone from arguing with me the definition of the list to trying to disprove its proper workings. On top of that, I never said this class was better than ArrayList or LinkedList. I did, however, say it is better speedwise than both of those lists, with the same capabilities of both. This has been proven regardless of what you think. It has limitations, sure, but it works and that’s that.</p>

<p>It’s not exactly the same as that, but I do it because the hashCode() methods of Objects are a lot faster than the equals() method, since the equals() method is usually extended on most objects to ensure that the two objects are equal or different. Proof of this is faster and smarter to do is the statistics I collected while testing the performance of HashList versus ArrayList in my first post. ArrayList, in their indexOf() method, use linear searching across their list and check if it found the index by using the current object’s equal method. Mine does the same thing, except it checks the hash value, which is considerably faster.</p>

<p>I fully understand what the purpose of hashing is. The only difference between the way I used it and the way, say, a Hashtable uses it, is, my List orders the objects into a linked array such as LinkList does, but maintains the high speeds of comparing hash values.<br>

uno, trying to justify it like that makes me think even less of you, you obviously have no idea at all how a hashtable works, and you seen to think that hash + linked list = linear complexity</p>
<p>i say again, you are an idiot[/quote]</p>
<p>If you actually looked at the Hashtable code for the Java utility Hashtable, you’d see it contains a simple table of entries. Their entry classes contain the key, value, hash value, and the next entry in the list. A part of the concept for a Hashtable is using the hash as an index within the table to store the entries. Mine doesn’t work that way, because it is built to maintain linkage of entries so that no entries are lost.</p>
<p>Secondly, I never said, implied, or speculated that a hashtable system in a linked list has anything to do with linear searching. I said my list uses linear searching when searching for objects, and searches for them based on their hash values. Since my List does not work exactly the same way as a Hashtable, it’s entries always remain in the proper order and can’t be lost.</p>

Anyone can use this class for whatever reason he or she sees fit, as I really can’t stop them from doing so. I released it to be used, so use it.

              <p>Since my time of learning how to use the java.util.List Collection utility, I have mainly used ArrayList. ArrayList is one of the fastest List collections and is supposed to represent a mutable generic object array. Well, I recently looked through the code of ArrayList, and I didn’t like what I saw. I thought they did a very horrible way of handling and finding objects inside their code, so I set out to design my own List implementation whose processing speeds could compete with that of ArrayList’s.</p>
<p>I started this list a few days ago, and finished only recently (yesterday or two days ago). I have tested it up against ArrayList, and it has surpassed the speeds tremendously. I could not believe my eyes when I saw the test results, so I went out and checked my code over and over again. Usually when something like this happens unexpectedly, there is usually a failing bug in the background. I tested my list so thoroughly that I found no bugs whatsoever.</p>
<p>Now, getting past the introduction. This list, as its name and the title of this topic imply, is built upon a hash framework. The list gains the hash’d value of an object being entered into the array, and then stored it perfectly mapped against its respective object. This way, when searching the list for an object, it searches against the hash value of the object instead of the object itself. This was the original idea of the list, and the idea which was successfully implemented inside this new list construction.</p>
<p>I built a small test class (source code can be seen at the bottom of this post) that tested my hash list against an array list. The results were spectacular. I tested my list implementation against array list with 100 objects, 1000 objects, 10,000 objects, and 100,000 objects. The types of objects I tested were both doubles and Strings. Strings are a lot slower for my list, because their hashcode() method is much more expensive. Anyway, the following are the results for each list, for each number of objects:</p>

<p>As you can clearly see, my list tops array list in high fields, but suffers in lower fields. It shouldn’t beat arraylist especially in the add() method, because it must calculate the hash value where arraylist simply adds the object. My list tops especially in the indexing field, considering that is the base of this entire list (the searching for objects).</p>
<p>Alright, time to get beyond the performance testing and purpose. The following is a link to a pastebin which contains the code for the HashList class (since the code itself is greater than 20,000 characters, the limit of posts on mopar):</p>

<p>The following is the code I used to test the performance of HashList against ArrayList:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">import java.util.*;

public class Test {

	private static int len = 100;

	public static final void main(String[] args) {
		ArrayList&lt;String&gt; arrayListStr = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
		ArrayList&lt;Double&gt; arrayListDbl = new ArrayList&lt;Double&gt;();

		HashList&lt;String&gt; hashListStr = new HashList&lt;String&gt;();
		HashList&lt;Double&gt; hashListDbl = new HashList&lt;Double&gt;();

		long l1 = timeListStringFill(arrayListStr);
		long l2 = timeListStringGet(arrayListStr);
		long l3 = timeListStringIndexFind(arrayListStr);
		long l4 = timeListClear(arrayListStr);
		System.out.println("Processing ArrayList with "+len+" Strings: filled "+
				"in "+l1+"ms, iterated in "+l2+"ms, indexed find in "+l3+"ms, "+
				"cleared list in "+l4+"ms");
		
		arrayListStr = null;
		System.gc();

		long l5 = timeListDoubleFill(arrayListDbl);
		long l6 = timeListDoubleGet(arrayListDbl);
		long l7 = timeListDoubleIndexFind(arrayListDbl);
		long l8 = timeListClear(arrayListDbl);
		System.out.println("Processing ArrayList with "+len+" Doubles: filled "+
				"in "+l5+"ms, iterated in "+l6+"ms, indexed find in "+l7+"ms, "+
				"cleared list in "+l8+"ms");
		
		arrayListDbl = null;
		System.gc();
		
		long h1 = timeListStringFill(hashListStr);
		long h2 = timeListStringGet(hashListStr);
		long h3 = timeListStringIndexFind(hashListStr);
		long h4 = timeListClear(hashListStr);
		System.out.println("Processing HashList with "+len+" Strings: filled "+
				"in "+h1+"ms, iterated in "+h2+"ms, indexed find in "+h3+"ms, "+
				"cleared list in "+h4+"ms");
		
		hashListStr = null;
		System.gc();
		
		long h5 = timeListDoubleFill(hashListDbl);
		long h6 = timeListDoubleGet(hashListDbl);
		long h7 = timeListDoubleIndexFind(hashListDbl);
		long h8 = timeListClear(hashListDbl);
		System.out.println("Processing HashList with "+len+" Doubles: filled "+
				"in "+h5+"ms, iterated in "+h6+"ms, indexed find in "+h7+"ms, "+
				"cleared list in "+h8+"ms");
	}

	private static final long timeListStringFill(List&lt;String&gt; list) {
		long l = System.currentTimeMillis();
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; len; i++)
			list.add(i + "");
		return System.currentTimeMillis() - l;
	}

	private static final long timeListDoubleFill(List&lt;Double&gt; list) {
		long l = System.currentTimeMillis();
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; len; i++)
			list.add((double)i);
		return System.currentTimeMillis() - l;
	}

	private static final long timeListClear(List&lt;?&gt; list) {
		long l = System.currentTimeMillis();
		list.clear();
		return System.currentTimeMillis() - l;
	}

	private static final long timeListStringIndexFind(List&lt;String&gt; list) {
		long l = System.currentTimeMillis();
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; len; i++)
			list.indexOf(i + "");
		return System.currentTimeMillis() - l;
	}

	private static final long timeListDoubleIndexFind(List&lt;Double&gt; list) {
		long l = System.currentTimeMillis();
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; len; i++)
			list.indexOf((double)i);
		return System.currentTimeMillis() - l;
	}

	private static final long timeListStringGet(List&lt;String&gt; list) {
		long l = System.currentTimeMillis();
		for (String s : list);
		return System.currentTimeMillis() - l;
	}

	private static final long timeListDoubleGet(List&lt;Double&gt; list) {
		long l = System.currentTimeMillis();
		for (double d : list);
		return System.currentTimeMillis() - l;
	}
}

<p>Well, that’s all of it. I don’t know the practicality of using this HashList over ArrayList, but I know I will be using it for heavy operations which may use more than 10,000 objects (in which case, array list would be epic failure just from calling a simple contains() method).</p>
<p>Pleas leave some feedback, as I know this class is much more epic than the last generic class I posted and actually works. I wouldn’t have posted it on mopar unless I wanted some sort of constructive criticism. Thanks, and have a good day (or better, if you are already having a bad one ;)).</p>
