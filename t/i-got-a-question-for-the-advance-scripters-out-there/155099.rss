    <title>I got A Question for the advance scripters out there!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-got-a-question-for-the-advance-scripters-out-there/155099</link>
    <description>ok i made an autotalker tat allows multiple words and i did this to decrease the possibility of being detected soooo I was wondering if it is possible to have SCAR just randomly pick a sentence put in to the script. For Example:

[code]const
Talk=&#39;Text Here&#39;;
Say=&#39; Type Text Here&#39;;
Talk2=&#39;More Text Here&#39;;
Say2=&#39; Put Text Here&#39;;[/code]

is it pssible to have SCAR just randomly choose Say then Say2 and type them then g to Talk2 Then Talk?? 

for example have it write:

[code]Type Text Here
then
Put Text Here
then
More Text Here
then
Text Here[/code]

Then once finished with that command repeats it but this time randomly does:

[code]Put Text Here
then
Text Here
then
Type Text Here
then 
More Text Here[/code]

What do I have to do to get SCAR to do something like that (randomly choose a sentence and type it)?? If you can tell me Id really appreciate it =) You Guys Are Lucky Im Going To Have To Give A Sneak Peek Of My New Script lol

[code]//LevExidus AutoTalker V.3
//For The Newbies Out There Feel Free To Use This To Learn How To Script.
program AutoTalker;
{.Include SRL/SRL.Scar}
  // if you want to only have a certain
  //amount of text just keep them blank.
  //to prevent you from being detected i suggest
  //you dont change the TWait. For better
  //protection make it higher.
const
  Talk = &#39;Text Here&#39;; //what to say
  TWait = 2000; //time to wait after typing
  Say = &#39;More Text Here&#39;; // Second Text
  Talk2 = &#39;More Text Here&#39;; //Third text
  Say2 = &#39;More Text Here&#39;; // Fourth Text
  TalkAgain = &#39;More Text Here&#39;; // Last Text (Fifth)

procedure TalkOn;
begin
  repeat //Reapeats the following:
    Wait(TWait + random(700));
    case 1 + Random(5) of
      1: typesend(Talk);

      2: typesend(Say);

      3: typesend(Talk2);

      4: typesend(Say2);

      5: typesend(TalkAgain);
  until (false); //False = never ends.. Ends Repeat.
end;

begin //BEGINS
  repeat //Repeats The Foloing:
    TalkOn; // Does everything in procedure TalkOn;
  until (false) //keeps going Forever.. Ends Repeat.
end. //End of Script[/code]

Ok Now I Was Tryng To Test The Script But I Kept Getting This Error about until(false):
Failed when compiling
Line 32: [Error] (14713:1): Syntax error in script

Any Idea Cuase I Don&#39;t Got One</description>

<p>The problem was that you didn’t have a second end; there, I removed the repeat in the case procedure as well since well, it’s a waste. Cases need an end; on there own. Hope I helped =].[/code]</p>

<p>That is horrible. It will say the text. More text, more text, more text, over and over. Your one in the first post SHOULD work great.</p>

It’s best if you start with a case 0.<br>
And please indent your coding.<br>
Here you can make your script like this:</p>
