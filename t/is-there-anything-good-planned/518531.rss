    <title>Is there anything good planned?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-there-anything-good-planned/518531</link>
    <description>Well as the topic states, is there any good servers being worked on? I had to go away for a little bit when I left Project RSC was a few weeks old and was I was enjoying that alot, but now that I&#39;m home I see that it&#39;s dead. I also remember something about RSCD before Luke passed wasn&#39;t sure if that was still being developed or not. Anyways, if there is any decent (preferably low rate) servers coming out I&#39;d really love to hear about them. Even custom/PK servers that are actively developed with decent player base as I haven&#39;t found one yet. I logged on RSCE but that&#39;s really my last alternative here, unless they were to reset everything or something I can&#39;t play where the economy is so screwed, not really fun to be honest. Well I&#39;d love to hear about up and comers or future projects, anything !
