    <title>Requesting 24/7 Host (PI)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/requesting-24-7-host-pi/387795</link>
    <description>I&#39;m needing a 24/7 hoster for my 317 loading 602 server.
I&#39;m getting my computer&#39;s hard drive cleaned in a few days and need a host.
It needs to be a vps host obviously 

The pay?  All donations to the server will go to you.
I can&#39;t guarantee that the server will be an instant success, but it will gain players and donations over time.
Donation costs won&#39;t be high like corruptionx and not low like spawning servers
RS account donations: No unless you want them
You will also be a moderator on the server

The source was from a friend and is still being developed.
It has many 602 features like Curses (Soulsplit is underway)
Korasi (Special on the way) [I know that&#39;s not a 602 feature, but the model is there]
Colored whips
ALL Dungeoneering Armour and Weapons working (Bows are glitchy + maul emotes are incorrect)
Chaotics &amp; Gravite
Staff of light
Spitit shield
(The list can go on  for a very long time)

I hope you choose to help me.
