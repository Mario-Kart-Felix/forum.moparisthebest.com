              <p>I wont be making your server, but I am just asking: is this the kind of server people are looking for? Is that what they really want?</p>
<p>Im a hoster and coder myself - but Im always looking for something completely new to put in my server. And what you have told me is… what every server has and where I (personally) say: “meh… nothing new… wheres the fun…”</p>
<p>PS: Most codes already have these stuff tho.</p>
