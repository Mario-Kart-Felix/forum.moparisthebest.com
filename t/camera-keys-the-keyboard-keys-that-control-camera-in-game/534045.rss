    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/camera-keys-the-keyboard-keys-that-control-camera-in-game/534045</link>
    <description>Hello all, i recently have been starting to look into private server&#39;s again, and might be thinking of different tactics and ways to do a few things but am i currently here to ask if anyone has the knowledge to share with me on how to change the camera keys, like the arrow keys.

I would like to switch the arrows keys with WASD keys.

Please and thankyou.</description>

              <p>generally the rs applet handles all key listeners, so yes. most likely it will be there.</p>
<p>if you already knew how to change the function keys, you should know where the camera is.</p>
<p>however, you will need to disable chat input for the chat box before doing so. make a certain key toggle chat input so that you can use wasd for camera, and you can type with wasd as well.</p>
