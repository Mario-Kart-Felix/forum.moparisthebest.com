    <title>Franchising or Limited Companies?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/franchising-or-limited-companies/312087</link>
    <description>I have an assignment for this Thursday and although I don&#39;t need help with it, I just want your views and opinions on the issue.
Well, the project is in Business Studies and it&#39;s about wether if I had a choice, would I choose Franchising or Limited Companies?
Well I&#39;ve sorted my points out and however no answer can be right, it will be appreciated if you explain your answer.

[quote=&quot;R.I.P RSC&quot;]It all depends on the market you&#39;re in.
[quote author=akl link=topic=408528.msg3015580#msg3015580 date=1257168873]
Please ignore that, we&#39;re considering this in UK. 
[/quote][/quote]


If you choose either, you have to list down advantages and d/advantages to just be fair.

Good luck and I&#39;m excited to hear the replies.</description>

<p>And why the fuck would a butchery/vegetable shop be a Private Limited Company? No one would start such a private service and want enlarge it on a wide basis.</p>

<p>If you plan on selling fast food in a small town, or from a small property, you’d join a fast food franchise (not McDonalds). If you have a bigger property and you are in a big town or city, you’d join McDonalds. If you start a big supermarket in a big town/city, you join a franchise. A small supermarket in a small town could be both. A specialized shop (butcher, vegetable shop) usually is a limited company.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No you are wrong akl. You still have full control, you don’t just sell your name with a franchise, you sell your products, your protocol, your everything. For example, have you ever seen a mcdonalds that hasnt got the classic mcdonalds layout inside, or a mcdonalds that has staff that dont have to wear uniform. No. The reason is because when franchising a business, you have a whole contract, in affect you control all the smaller businesses, the owners only really manage these businesses and control the cash flow. Franchisers are also expected to do things such as staff training, this is usually made up by the steep royalty they charge. The key is to remember, with a franchise you buy more than just the name and you have much less control than you may think.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Franchising is like stated million times everywhere, as if borrowing someone’s business overall.<br>
You are only starting a small outlet of that business in your local area, and in this case let’s say your frachisor is McDonalds.<br>
You are not the owner, you are just the frachisee who has been allowed to sell the products of that company in the same style, manner, technique as that company has previously sold.<br>
It’s one of the best ways to make money since it requires very little extensive business knowledge since all the management issues are taken care of by the frachisor.<br>
However, you cannot change the way the business runs to your local market’s liking as it is not your business in entirety.<br>
You are making profits more than what you would’ve made if your business was not called McDonald’s since you are using McDonald’s name, it’s recipe, it’s technique, it’s trained staff.</p>
<p>I am neither nieve nor ignorant, however that is your opinion of people who think otherwise of what you think and I respect that.</p>

For example, have you ever seen a mcdonalds that hasnt got the classic mcdonalds layout inside, or a mcdonalds that has staff that dont have to wear uniform. No. The reason is because when franchising a business, you have a whole contract, in affect you control all the smaller businesses, the owners only really manage these businesses and control the cash flow. Franchisers are also expected to do things such as staff training, this is usually made up by the steep royalty they charge. The key is to remember, with a franchise you buy more than just the name and you have much less control than you may think.</p>
<p>Also as someone previously stated, it depends entirely which market your in, what product it is, who your target audience is, what your aims and objectives are, how much money you have to invest and so much more. I mean, for example say you NEED to have a positive cashflow to stay aboard and your franchise royalties per month cost more than you’ll make in the first 6 months, you can’t possibly become a franchise.</p>
<p>In short, what im saying is: you can’t just say ‘whats best, a limited company or a franchise?’ they both have entirely different attributes for entirely different circumstances and the decision depends entirely on the business and the business plan. You are both nieve and ignorant if you believe otherwise.</p>

<p>McDonald is shit, tbh. But yes, I get your point and I agree.<br>
But what if the business goes out of hand? Even <span class="bbcode-i">you</span> go out then too.<br>
And you can’t really make the changes to suit it to your local market since the control of the business is in the hand of the person who lent you their name.</p>

<p>A lot of Dutch supermarkets are part of a franchise. The shop manager usually owns/rents the property, and the supermarket delivers the products and advertising.</p>

<p>The question is wether YOU would prefer franchising more to Limited companies (or vice versa) ignoring the product market value/the product you are selling.</p>

<p>What I’m trying to make clear is that it does depend on your product. A supermarket chain rarely is a holding, with every different shop as a separate ltd. They choose for franchising. A bank on the other hand has a different subsidiary for insurances, savings, etc.</p>
