    <description>Whenever I run .bat files this error pops up now.

[code]Error occurred during initialization of VM
java/lang/NoClassDefFoundError: java/lang/Object
Press any key to continue . . .



[/code]
This never happened before and I just recently came back from a long break. This prevents me from compiling my server but I can still run it.[br][size=1]Posted on: June 16, 2007, 01:32:36 PM[/size][hr]Anybody? This has never happened before and it seems to only happen to compile and the file that runs a client.</description>
