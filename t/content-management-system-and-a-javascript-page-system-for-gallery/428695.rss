Temporary host^
Finished developing a site for a client, well, almost.  Just need some help with a couple of things.

How would I go about adding a CMS to this kind of site for the end user?  The site will need to be updated every month or so.

Also, if you take a look at the gallery, you can see I&#39;ve added some next and back page navigation buttons, though they are currently non-functional, as I&#39;m not sure what to do with them?  I want to integrate some sort of next page function (obviously), but not sure how to do it, and there are 5~ pages of images.

I was thinking I could use javascript to remove the div containing the current page of images, and then using it to make a new div appear containing a page of new images, has anyone had any experience with doing something similar?
oh and i have very little javascript knowledge, but willing to learn.

also uh, if it&#39;s not too much to ask, could somebody test the compatibility for iphones/ipod touch?  The flash is meant to rollback to html5 video, so it should work but have yet to try it, works alright on my htc sensation though.

Much appreciated.

tl;dr: how to integrate content management system and a method of gallery navigation, not using a slideshow object.</description>

on another note its very important to keep the backend updated at all times, many people sit around exploiting older CMS software even if its a site noone goes too, I think Wordpress as a really easy and painless update process.<br>

that’s the thing, most exploited sites are the small ones that you wouldn’t consider, for example I had a website for my grandmother that was just a simple wordpress blog that had only family traffic, I had neglected to check it for awhile and when I finally did some “turkish hacking team” had defaced the site with a wordpress exploit. easily avoidable if i had just kept the software updated.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well it currently does work with most phones so shouldn’t be a problem, as long as they have javascript (even then, the only javascript used is in the gallery (popups), and on the homepage for that slideshow, rest is all css).  The flash has a 3rd rollback to a low .3gp format too.<br>
Works perfectly on my android device, and I imagine iPhone will work though I have yet to try it, so that’s 80% ish of the mobile market that it is compatible with, the other 20% probably aren’t bothered about mobile browsing anyway.</p>

Thanks for the recommendation, I heard of that before but wasn’t sure whether it would work with a site layout like this <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> Guess the only way to find out is to try it out!</p>
<p>Still need to figure out what to do with with the gallery, hmm.</p>

              <p>You could use javascript but it would also be good to have an alternative navigation method as many people (such as myself) usually have javascript turned off and really get annoyed when sites force it to be turned on to function.</p>

<p>Temporary host^<br>
Finished developing a site for a client, well, almost.  Just need some help with a couple of things.</p>
<p>How would I go about adding a CMS to this kind of site for the end user?  The site will need to be updated every month or so.</p>
<p>Also, if you take a look at the gallery, you can see I’ve added some next and back page navigation buttons, though they are currently non-functional, as I’m not sure what to do with them?  I want to integrate some sort of next page function (obviously), but not sure how to do it, and there are 5~ pages of images.</p>
<p>I was thinking I could use javascript to remove the div containing the current page of images, and then using it to make a new div appear containing a page of new images, has anyone had any experience with doing something similar?<br>
oh and i have very little javascript knowledge, but willing to learn.</p>
<p>also uh, if it’s not too much to ask, could somebody test the compatibility for iphones/ipod touch?  The flash is meant to rollback to html5 video, so it should work but have yet to try it, works alright on my htc sensation though.</p>
<p>Much appreciated.</p>
<p>tl;dr: how to integrate content management system and a method of gallery navigation, not using a slideshow object.</p>
