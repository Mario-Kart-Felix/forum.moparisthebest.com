    <title>Need help with my dueling. No errors just glitches</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-my-dueling-no-errors-just-glitches/134141</link>
    <description>Well i have about 5 glitches with my dueling, ud need to come onto the server to witness what they are because they are hard to explain.

If you think you can help me then please add me on msn

dean_a_g@hotmail.co.uk

One of them is to do with packets and like every 5 seconds i get this error, i havnt seen it before in any of my other sources. Its to do with attacking because its when you attack a monster most of the time.

This is the error

[code][client-2-zee_best]: Unhandled packet [77, InterFaceId: 51685, size=12]: ]65 E9
B0 24 0C 40 26 DF 57 D2 64 21[[/code]

Its different every time apart from its always packet 77. I think its to do with npcHandler but im not sure. After the errors come theres like 1min then it will just crash the server.

Thanks[br][size=1]Posted on: August 16, 2007, 07:28:42 AM[/size][hr]Oops double post sorry</description>
