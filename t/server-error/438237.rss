    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-error/438237</link>
    <description>Alright thanks for clicking this in a first place and reading this. I&#39;ve got a friend running a server (well attempting to but it&#39;s currently not running) He&#39;s looking for help he made a topic on another forum. Nobody was able to help so i suggested Mopar, trusting my gut you guys maybe are more helpful. This is his explanation, I don&#39;t understand it as I dont know errors you get.

&quot;Hey guys..so i got those errors client &amp; server sided that i just cant get to work.. can anyone help me fix them teamviewing? and also maybe help me add one quick thing cuz i find it kinda hard? add me on skype or post yours here 

Daniel-shadyy&quot;

If anyones willing to help him with a 317 Server add his skype: Daniel-shadyy

Thanks in advanced to anyone able to help him with his problem.</description>
