    <title>Server error?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-error/431171</link>
    <description>Alright, so I recently downloaded Dannyscape v4 (Delta), and I know what your first words are going to be, &quot;Delta sucks, get a PI server you dumb faggy noob.&quot;, well you know what? I like deltas, they are easier to code, there is a larger selection of customs to choose from, etc.
Anyways, I recently downloaded this source again (mainly because its the first source i ever used), and when ever I try to run the client, it doesnt work. I dont get an error or anything, it just opens a cmd window and then closes. I was wondering if this was an error with the server/source. If not, can anyone help me with this?</description>
