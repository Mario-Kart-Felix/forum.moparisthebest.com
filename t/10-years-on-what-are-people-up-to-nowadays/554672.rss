    <description>

Considering most of those I was around with at the time were around 14 years ikd...I now realise it&#39;s been 10 years on! We&#39;re adults!...Sort of. 

So, I was curious, what are people up to nowadays? Any/coding/particularly help shape your path?</description>

              <p>So anyone got any updates? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I’m in the situation where my corporate job is kinda boring at the moment.</p>
<p>We get to use a lot of the latest tools and so on. We’ve also got a lot of great things in place, like continuous integration and one-click build/deployment for a lot of our software.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we’ve recently indulged in so-called ‘pure scrum’ which is tedious. The worst part is the fortnightly 4 to 5 hour meeting block (a series of scrum meetings that are back-to-back).</p>
<p>I look at job ads and they’re all stuck using far older stuff. I kinda feel like anywhere I go from here is going to be a step backwards technology-wise. Does anyone have experience with this? Does it even matter in terms of fulfillment in the role?</p>

              <p>i got married when i was 19, things have been going well in that regard. i traded off high academia for an “alright” school i could breeze through so i could support myself independent of my parents, and established myself at a large automotive supplier. i interned as a hardware engineer even though i majored in CS (not sure how I convinced them, I didn’t even know what they were talking about at the interview, but it worked out), now i am full time making too much money writing awful c code for bluetooth low energy communications and cybersecurity (flip of the hat color, i feel gross)… after this project i may go into their r&amp;d department as they know this doesn’t scratch my bleeding edge itch even though it’s our most advanced project thus far. i’ve considered SV a few times but i am rooted here for now, maybe in the future<br>
I’ve also gotten very interested in marijuana and psychedelics, which have helped me get better / find some direction</p>
