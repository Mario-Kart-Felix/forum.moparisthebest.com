    <description>I Am setting up a server just for testing purposes really nothing special, It&#39;s been about 3 years since I last even tampered with one really, managed to overcome every error i have come across really, including the fact you can&#39;t compile a server with any new apache ant or java version.

The error i am experiencing comes to light when i try and change my new forum accounts rank. So for example when i change from group_id 4 to 1.

I get the below error:

An error was encountered
Error: Unable to fetch reports info.

This is when i goto 127.0.0.1


P.s This seems to come about whenever i try to change somebodys information in the users table in phpmyadmin, I have tried deleting cache before hand and still get the problem.

Regards
