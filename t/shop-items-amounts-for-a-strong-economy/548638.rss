    <title>Shop items/amounts for a strong economy?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shop-items-amounts-for-a-strong-economy/548638</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m working on a server and I am currently in the research stage of this project, I present to you my latest questions which are based around the economy and how readily accessible some of the items should be? After all there&#39;s no point having a perfect economy if sticks with it long enough to experience it right? Or am I wrong? I want to hear either way! 

Just please remember to put at the minimum a simple one word response at least for each number below to help me with my &quot;on paper&quot; research.

If you could just put a simple GOOD or BAD next to the relevant number then that would be excellent. If you wish to elaborate on your point then that&#39;s even better but a simple GOOD or BAD will still work wonders for me.

[u]1) Food Shop[/u]

10,000 Noted &amp; Cooked Swordfish, the rest would be fished up by players in order to meet the demands of the players as the server grows.

[u]2) Rune Shop[/u]

50,000 of each &quot;basic&quot; rune (Basic - Fire, Earth, Water, Air, Mind, Chaos, Cosmic, Law, Soul etc.)
10,000 of each &quot;advanced&quot; rune (Advanced - Death, Blood &amp; Astral)

The rest of the runes would be rune crafted by players as demand increases and as the economy grows.

[u]3) Potion Shop[/u]

5,000 of each &quot;basic&quot; potion (Basic - Restores, Strength, Attack, Defence, Ranging, Magic, Prayer, Anti poison etc.)
1,000 of each &quot;advanced&quot; potion (Advanced - Super Restores, Super Strength, Super Attack, Saradomin Brew etc.)

The rest would be made from players through Farming and Herblore.

[u]4) Armour Shop[/u]

1,000 of each piece of &quot;basic&quot; armour (Basic - Bronze -&gt; Rune, Ghostly, Obsidian cloak, possibly dragon? (Skiller&#39;s outfits will be in a separate store)

The rest is to be acquired from drops, rewards and of course PLAYERS!


Many thanks and if you have anything at all that you wish to add then I&#39;m all ears!</description>

              <p>To be honest playing a rsps with items/shops handing you everything gets boring, where is the challenge within the game to go make items or try to buy it off other users. How I see it is if you sell lets say dragon armor/armour please won’t need to fight hard monsters (dragons etc) to try and get it which makes it pointless for people to get money gp. I will give you an example, my buddy had just made a server he asked me to join so I did, first account I got 50m, 25 dragon scims, iron scim, iron platelegs,body,full helm,kiteshield, and 5k monks fish, I leveled the basic (att,str,deff,magic,and range) within 3 hours after 4 or 5 I got off and was like why do I want to play anymore since I have everything I want on the game but so does everyone else. I feel like private servers should go back to the good old basics and give users minimal items and make it semi difficult to get an item they always wanted, make it so players want to trade other players for items/goods (I need food) well there are 10 people who like fishing and 4 who likes cooking so boom you got the users who fight (gets items and coins) and buys the food etc from the fishers and cookers. Makes everyone happy and keeps the eco nice and smooth, also don’t make the leveling system crazy other wise people will join on the first day and play 3-4 days and be 99 in certain stats, makes it fun but gets boring fast after you can’t do anything with the levels anymore. I hope this helps in bettering your rsps.</p>

<p>[size=9pt]I’m very glad people such as yourself and many others are happy to help me with this and I hope to rise to the challenge and meet both the standards I’ve set myself and the standards of the RSPS community. I see your point with pickpocketing and feathers, I’ll certainly take it on board and check what others views are on a similar type of system but I believe there is a need to find a balance between 100% Economy which can be a bore and an economy where you’re given everything immediately. I’m open to debates about this of course as always.[/size]</p>

</aside>
<p>[size=9pt]Honestly I don’t mind if the point has been touched on before, there’s always room for another’s opinion on any subject vaguely relating to what I’m asking. So in response to your point -</p>
<p>Yes I certainly do agree with you, I believe what you’ve described there is basically the cornerstone to an economy driven server. So as you may know I’m carrying out a lot of research from a variety of different sources (Forums, Spawn Servers, “Economy” Servers etc.) to see how important an economy is to people.</p>
<p>So far these are the results I’ve gotten when I asked the question <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-u">“How important is a strong economy on an RSPS to you personally out of 10?”</span></span></p>
<p>[spoiler][9\10]<br>

[/spoiler]</p>
<p>[size=9pt]So the message there is very clear, it’s certainly something people want as some of those responses were even taken from people on spawn servers as stated above but I believe there may well be a balance between having a 100% economy server and having everything given to them. I believe that in a nutshell on an RSPS you should give people what they NEED to get what they WANT but not just give them what they WANT immediately.[/size]</p>
<p>[size=10pt]<span class="bbcode-b">But I cannot do it without you guys so keep the responses coming in please!

<p>Armor shop? Basic armor up to adamant, leather, wizard robes, etc are fine, imo. Have other outlets for rune, dragon, dragon hide, etc.</p>
