    <description>[left]Welcome to DeadLock™

This is my server that I have been progressivly developing. Its based around the 377 erra and uses a clean but slightly renamed 377 client with its original cache. 
[center]The networking side of things is powered by a nio library I released a little while ago called RSNio
It uses JDBC with sqlite for storage
A custom engine I have been developing. [/center]

Now the idea here is to program a fully functioning server which is just as stable as current releases but raises above  because of its unique content. The &#39;tick&#39; off the server is the same as every other server it runs at 600ms intervals and has four tasks which are 

[center]- update movement -
- synchronize players - 
- reset updating flags -
- process ground data-[/center]

Each stage is multithreaded but the stages happen in a sequential order. The server uses a whole lot of new idea&#39;s which I havn&#39;t seen before. This includes container flagging for inventories, a new interface system to manage interface actions with ease. The combat system is being developed from the ground up, a unique dialoge system for ease of chaining and flexability. I&#39;ve been developing a ground system which is very unique and have not seen one as promising as the one implemented. This isn&#39;t all though because the server is 100% &#39;clip proof&#39; you simply cannot clip. This also applies for npc&#39;s. Using this clipping system I have created a rather successful and universal following system which is entity based for both player and npc&#39;s.

The amount of time I have spent making sure that the content is dupe free and unhackable, well you wouldn&#39;t believe me, but I have spent hours opon hours off thinking about different idea&#39;s to implement. For an example, the interface system I use, unless the server has an interface open it doesn&#39;t actually know that the actions exist so therefor a player cannot modify the client to send the needed data for an example to transfer an item to the bank without it being open. It even validates that the ground objects exist when you interact with them.

I&#39;m currently debating whether or not to release the source because I do agree with open source but I havn&#39;t decided yet. Maybe only to those trusted on rune-server.

Anyway enough about the good stuff...

The game play isn&#39;t limited. I am implementing everything I have time for and i&#39;m certainly not limiting skills to certain erea&#39;s. although i&#39;m pushing it towards a combat server, the skilling will be just as good. I&#39;ve even implemented cups of tea!

Here is an update list for you people to follow.

[u][b]The basics[/b][/u]

[ul][li]Fully compatible with a 377 client.[/li]
[li]Full npc/player rendering with all update flags which includes multiplayer support.[/li]
[li]Support for adding future login server.[/li]
[li]JDBC database compatibility - currently uses a Sqlite database for storing landscape information, accounts, dialogs, npcs, items, and more.
[/li]
[li]Banking, Shoping, Trading, Inventories. All dupe free.[/li][/ul]


[b][u]Working Skills[/u][/b]

[ul][li]Firemaking - 99%[/li]
[li]Woodcutting - 99%[/li]
[li]Prayer - Bury Bones and full usage of prayer.[/li]
[li]Thieving - Stalls only[/li]
[li]Fishing - 99%[/li]
[li]Crafting - Gem and leather[/li]
[li]Cooking - fires and cookers[/li]
[li]Runecrafting - with multiple runes and talismon locating[/li][/ul]



[ul][li]Full walking, chat, animation and graphic support[/li]
[li]Full multi-player support[/li]
[li]Plenty of update masks, both for player and npc&#39;s - Hit1 and Hit2, animation, graphic, face entity, appearance[/li]
[li]Entity based combat support. Simple combat, one animation, one hit amount and facing entity. Flawless at the moment. I have developed a new hit system server side so that second hits hit with there first hit in synch.[/li]
[li]Banking, Shoping, Inventories. I am likely going to redo these.[/li]
[li]Modified client to allow path finding - client side. This will change to a server side algorithm.[/li]
[li]Multithread/parallel tick processing (pre update(walking), update(player and npcs), and post update(nulling of veriables)[/li]
[li][s]All information that the server needs will be loaded through a special one file server cache. I have made the standered gui and NPC definition editing support. Currently working on Item definition now[/s] - removed due to database.[/li]
[li]The server makes use of two new filter&#39;s which occour before login, a ConnectionThrottleFilter and a BlacklistFilter. The blacklist loads a list of all current blocked ip addresses and disconnects them opon login returning that the player has broke the rules and is banned.[/li]
[li]Added database support. The server now uses a SQlite database for loading definitions and spawns.[/li]
[li]Removed the TickTimer system I had developed for the server. The reason was because it slept until the tick has to be ran which ment it queued all tasks and then processed them all at once which was a bad idea. I have swapped back to using java.util.Timer.class although I am using a custom implementation of it which injects my servers engine with the tasks needed to be ran instead of running them in its own thread to remove all synchronization to events.[/li]
[li]Spawned most nonmember shop keepers and created most shops to go with them.[/li]
[li]Its now possible to add dialogs for interaction[/li]
[li]A more powerfull and chaining dialog system has been programmed. All the dialogs are loaded from the sql database. Npc 123 lines, player 123 lines, player questions 123 lines, closing, open bank, open shops All work and can be chained together.[/li]
[li]Crafting leather, gems and hide tanning now fully working[/li]
[li]inventory and equipment system rewrite - shield and two handed weapons cannot be worn.[/li]
[li]Updates on combat such as a combat maxhit calculater[/li]
[li]Fully working equipment bonues[/li]
[li]Started work on making a fishing base.[/li]
[li]More npcs have been added around the map[/li]
[li][s]Added an account creation system into the client and server. Now to log on you first create a new account by clicking new user. You fill in the username password and then click Create. There are a set of standared return messages which the server will chuck back at you.[/s] - Removed[/li]
[li]Proper loading/saving system in place now. Both works rather well.[/li]
[li]Implemented a prayer base. All prayer buttons work and are usable when implemented. Currently Protect Items, All Strength prayers(5%, 10%, and 15%), Retribution(now only affects people who are attacking you), Redemption, protect items, Melee protect, Smite all work. [/li]
[li]Keep items at death works now. if your skulled you will keep zero items unless KeepItem prayer is activated then you will keep one item. No skull you will keep three items and with prayer you will keep four items. The items are decided by default price loaded from my database.[/li]
[li]Redone how the server loads up. Its a lot better now. The server loads up in stages so that it can shutdown during those stages correctly if an error occoures.[/li]
[li]The server now has unique Threadmodel. All threads used by the server are created using specific ThreadFactory and a ThreadGroup. So that I can keep track of what threads their are, when their running, if their running. It also allows the server to shutdown very simply because all threads are in a simple threadgroup which can be interrupted.[/li]
[li]Made a few changes to the dialog system. The changes now allow for dialog actions like Attacking players,npcs and teleporting.[/li]
[li]Started implementing anti cheat methods. Added a report abuse system and all some packets such as window focusing, camera movement, mouse clicks.[/li]
[li]Implemented an Interface system which now allows the server to keep track on which interface a player has open. This allows for actions to automaticly happen when closing, opening interfaces. Each interface now handles its own action buttons and options 1-2-3-4-5 so that there are no massive switch statements for buttons etc. It also stops cheaters because you cannot send fake bank packets etc unless the interface is open serverside. This system is now flawless and has been tested.[/li]
[li]Completed quite a lot of work on the combat system. Implemented special attacks.[/li]
[li]A complete object list has been imported into our database to enable perfect distance walking etc and to illiminate fake object spawning/eccessing things like banks[/li]
[li]Implemented runecrafting. Full talismon locating, entering alters, crafting runes. Crafting multipliers are also implemented and 100% correct.[/li]
[li]Corrected multiple animations, teleporting locations.[/li]
[li]finished implementing a fishing system with chances. Supports catching between many fish.[/li]
[li]Cache loading is now accessable. It currently isn&#39;t loaded but is able to.[/li]
[li]Added a cooking system which supports chances of burning and cooking food successfully[/li]
[li]Regional based Npc&#39;s and players are now operational[/li]
[li]Fully functional regional based objects and items. Still some work needed on how they are sent to the client. It seems they should be sent in regional order with a begining packet which sends initial coordinates for each region[/li]
[li]Implemented trading with request queing/checking so that you can&#39;t keep accepting from the same request.[/li]
[li]Programmed and implemented a new Nio library so no more mina/netty and huge librarys.[/li]
[li]Have been working on a new clipping system for my server, one that is efficient, not memory intensive, no looping through massive arrays of tiles and garantee&#39;d perfect clipping. The system is fully programmed by me and may be released lateron. It uses a set of dumped files from the client stores the data in arrays and works with them. It uses less then 80mb memory and loads within 2 seconds. The system has allowed me to add full path verification, no more noclip commands what so ever, and perfect following. The best thing about this is its efficient.[/li]
[li]Custom loading bar when starting server. I&#39;ve implemented this to get rid of loading messages within the cmd. It shows onscreen loading stages and percenatage when loading the tile data(0 - 100%).[/li]
[li]Majorely updated and implemented new parts to the GroundItem and GroundObject System. No other server has a system like it.[/li]
[li]Dramaticly reduced the loading time for clipping data by using a different flatfile format.[/li]
[li]WoodCutting - Includes full groundobject transformation, decent chance calculator.[/li]
[li]Added Stall thieving, support for many different items from a single stall, full object transformation etc. support to allow X amount to be stole, good respawn times.[/li]
[li]Added Fully functional firemaking, drop log, light log, move left. 100% clipping and lighting area&#39;s so no lighting on other objects or close to buildings and certainly no walking left into walls etc..[/li]
[li]Random npc movement with bounds and npc following with bounds.[/li][/ul]



And last of all. Please have your say and suggest home spots, starting gear, training spots, other important locations ect ect.. I am letting you people decide on all of this.

[u]Here are a few pictures to keep you happy[/u].

<p>Thanks for the spelling mistakes, I’ll fix them. Yes I have made more progress.[quote=“Skullator, post:16, topic:334909”]Good luck, CRAIGY =D I’ll be keeping up with this shit :P[/quote]</p>
<p>Who are you? Can’t remember the account name.</p>
<p>I have finished redoing my inventory and equipment systems. Shields and two handed weapons cannot be worn. Its all tested. Equipment and weapon information are now from seperate tables now instead of having them merged with the default ItemDefintions table. I have added item bonuses now aswell so they are all showing properly.</p>
<p>The combat system is comming along nicely now. I have added a decent combat max hit calculator which includes your strength level, Strength bonus, and the prayer multiplier for when I add prayer.</p>
<p>I have spawned some new Npcs aswell now.</p>
<p>Thank!</p>

<p>Players, NPCs and Objects are entities, however those packages are related to the player and NPCs. Just think of the package “entities” replaced with “model”; it makes sense then.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Update:<br>
Work on combat and the RepetitivePacketFilter have been paused. During the mean time I have been developing a new core for the server. Before the core was made up of two threads one for timing and the other for processing. The timing thread would pass all its processing to the processing thread. That system had a few complications when making an event system because it was timed on one thread and then processed on the second. My new engine consists of two thread again. One for timing/updating and another for other logic processing such as packets. The timing thread sleeps roughly every 600ms and whilst its sleeping the logic processing thread kicks in. So no time is wasted between ticks.</p>
<p>I have been re-writing the current inventory/equipment system to a more efficient system which illiminates multple calls for sending equipment and inventory items to client per a method.</p>

<li>refactured and tidied up a few things, I am starting to make a mock up of a RepetitivePacketFilter what blocks the same packet opcode from being recieved within a certain interval. This filter could help but then it might not so I will be testing it before it officially goes into the server.</li>
</ul>
<p>Combat is the main thing I will be concentrating on for the next couple of weeks. I want it to be fair and as bug free as posible. Just added weapons speeds and npc attack speeds which are loaded from a database, at the moment the value’s are default and are all the same.</p>
