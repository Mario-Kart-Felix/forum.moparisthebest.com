    <description>Voters in San Francisco arrive at show banks how they feel about those one- as well as two-dollar ATM surcharges. Citizens are being asked to elect Tuesday on the hot-button customer issue, as CBS News Correspondent David Blackstone reports.There?Is actually little doubt that the proposed ban of cash appliance fees will complete, but since banks don&#39;t like the idea, they?Are actually certain to challenge virtually any injunction. Bankers contend the fees help pay for their expanding networks of ATMs. &quot;They&#39;re constantly charging a person for everything but people are sick of it,&quot; says 1 resident. The fees can add up if you are using an ATM with a bank where you don&#39;t have an account. The Atm machine affixes one charge, as well as your own bank contributes another. Pretty soon, it will take a $3 bite from your $20.Santa Monica has already handed down a city ban on surcharges, and other Florida communities are considering prohibits. Connecticut and Iowa have already passed laws and regulations implementing the bar. &quot;The voters and the consumers really have a right to stand approximately price gouging,&quot; affirms San Francisco City Supervisor Tom Ammianno. He has already been fighting to bar the fees.However the banks say should they lose this circular, they&#39;ll eventually earn in court.

It&#39;s an experience none of us wants, but most eventually deal with: burying a loved one. An experience at times made worse, the Economic council chair Special Committee in Aging was instructed Monday, by greedy funeral operators which prey on grieving family members.&quot;Funerals and cemeteries are a $12 thousand a year industry,&quot; said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, the panel&#39;s chairman. &quot;This is big business.Inch Although funerals be more pricey than ever - an average price of more than $7,Five-hundred - Grassley says the industry is inconsistently regulated. As well as, reports CBS Media Chief Washington Writer Bob Schieffer, the write-ups on serious problems the senators heard advise why closer scrutiny may be needed. One former funeral operator claimed by satellite via prison how high-pressure sales agents push prepaid funerals by making old people feel guilty. &quot;They tend to be pressured on the basis of guilt,&quot; said Irwin Karp. Aged customers are told, &quot;Do you want to leave this problem for your children when you&#39;re removed?&quot; A witness told how a good 81-year-old woman was spoken into buying room in a mausoleum, with a tan marker, all on the tune of $52,738. Knowning that was just for starters. The girl eventually paid more than $132,000 to a sales person from a Florida graveyard. To make matters worse, the high-price coffins as well as other gear don&#39;t constantly work. One woman broke down telling precisely how her grandmother&#39;s remains spilled out of the faulty coffin into a mausoleum.  &quot;I don&#39;t have any peaceful place to check out and memoralize my loved ones any longer,&quot; said Danell Pepson. &quot;I won&#39;t ever forget or reason away this atrocity.In . One industry leader were adament the problems were remote.  &quot;We would have hoped the hearings would have been less biased than they were,&quot; said Scott Harden of the Country wide Funeral Directors&#39; Association. &quot;I think it&#39;s very unfair, the actual funeral service is being colored with this broad comb, which is just not genuine.&quot;As the panel thinks about new regulations for your industry, Sen. Grassley urges consumers to shop around, ask questions and to be very careful what you signal.  [url=http://www.shinglespringsdreamhomes.com/guccioutlet.html]gucci outlet online[/url] 
Israeli archaeologists have unearthed brand-new clues as to when and how our early ancestors and forefathers first wandered out of Africa to populate the earth, reports Cbs television studios News Correspondent Jesse Schulman. Stone tools just discovered near the banks with the River Jordan may actually date back two million a long time, indicating humans passed through the Holy Terrain some two hundred thousand years earlier than previously thought.The earliest humans, known as hominids, first appeared within east Africa. Scientists believe they transferred out to the rest of the entire world through the so-called &quot;Levatine Corridor&quot; of the Middle East on their way for you to Europe and Asia.?&quot;Maybe this is the very first time that hominids went to Europe and Asia using the Levantine Corridor like a passageway,?&quot; said archaeologist Eitan Tchernov.Two million years ago the crude knives and also scrapers they laboriously chipped from stone into basic shapes were hi-tech. They were about every one of the early wanderers had to acquire food and protection, or for defense.Ancient finds show the actual Jordan River Vly provided the sustenance needed to get past your deserts. The tools were found one of the bones of an old elephant. One of our eager forebears lost it while scavenging the actual carcass for meat. Elephant meat may not very have been the milk and honey how the Holy Land is renowned for, but it was seemingly good enough to help begin humankind&#39;s long journey from Africa to all your corners of the earth.Reported by Jesse Schulman(Chemical)1999, CBS Throughout the world Inc., All Rights Reserved  [url=http://www.shinglespringsdreamhomes.com/guccioutlet.html]gucci outlet[/url]
