              <p>it was palistine that started this whole thing once the UK divided up palinstine into 2 half for israe and half for palistine. Israel got the desert part of the country and palinstine got the nicer side of the country. Then Palistine was pissed off about the whoke dividing thing. So they got egypt, lebyon, jordan. To help invade Israel. The war lasted 5days and Israel won and after they won they took 25%(around that much) more of palistine land. Then the other countries on palistine took the rest of plaistine land, so they were left with nm. It wasnt the Israels fault it was the palistines fault for trying to take over Israel</p>

              <p>Official death figures so far:</p>
<p>459 Lebanese murdered by the state of Israel (helped by US bombs)<br>
51 Israelis murdered by the unofficial peoples army of Lebanon (85% support)</p>
<p>Israel have also attacked and killed UN observers, and only today attacked a humanitarian medical convoy.<br>
In addition hundreds of thousands of Lebanese have been displaced from there war torn towns and villages.<br>
I am a christian, yet I am ashamed of Israel, and firmly stand by this threads title.</p>

<p>Ok, yeah. But when the US blames the a terrorist act on somebody, and our presidents father was meeting with that guys brother, and we have many of his family members here in the US, why do we let them fly out of the country without interrogating them?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as the hordes of Osama Bin Laden relatives who apparantly have no knowledge of Osamas existence and his lucrative business of blowing up American assets and are not connected with terrorists in any way are set free to head back home, we start detaining hundreds and hundreds of people for question as the massive 9/11 investigation begins.</p>
<p>Hmm, I’m no motherfucking detective, but if your looking for someone, don’t you start by asking the family members? If I was the president of a nation recently attacked, 6000 dead, I would tell my intelligence officers to start cutting of toes and ears, untill we got news of where the mother fucker who did this could be found.</p>

<p>pault is right the dfinition of terrorism is:The unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence by a person or an organized group against people or property with the intention of intimidating or coercing societies or governments, often for ideological or political reasons. which was exactly what israel did, they commited war crimes there for making it unlawful and they tried to coerce lebanon into backing down.</p>
