    <title>Battlescape client connection</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/battlescape-client-connection/339181</link>
    <description>Alright, I tried to connect to the battlescape server that I recently downloaded.
I have edited the connection port on the server.
I have already tried logging in with a silabsoft client to make sure that it wasn&#39;t the server.

I have went and changed the 127.0.0.1 ip in the client but it still wont connect to the server???
Also yes I have portforwarded correctly..</description>
