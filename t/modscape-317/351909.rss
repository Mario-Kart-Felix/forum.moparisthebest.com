   [b][size=36pt]ModScape 317[/size][/b]

  I was looking at servers people have made, servers with guns, servers with cars, and modern things like computers.  Couldn&#39;t be build a server like this, from the ground up?  

    I have found a blank server, just has basic runescape stuff.  Once I did that, I found a huge area of just black.  We first would model dirt, basic brown.  We could then overlap that with models like doors, walls, and other objects.  We would need to build roads any everything!


    Problems: 
                   1.  When your in the black zone, you cannot walk or move.  Would making dirt as a model and adding it fix that.  In private servers, if you right click on the ground nothing comes up.  If you right click on an objects, options come up.  How will be make real dirt.

     Possible Solution:  1. Find an area in the wilderness that is blank.
                              2. I&#39;ve seen people actually lift the ground and leave the models behind, probably not possible for us.
                              3. Make a ground, somehow....
                              4. Delete all objects, like lumb castle, delete towns, everything.  (Is it possible???) 



  I will be updating this often!  If anyone would like to help, find a blank client and server.  (I will find one today or tomorrow that the public can use.  The one I&#39;ve been working on is a private project, cant find the original download)

  If you would like to help out, fill this out

  UPDATE July 30 10:52 PM PACIFIC TIME:  I have found some guns that Tatemo coded for his ZombieScape source that he quit on.  I&#39;m sure we could use those with his permission.  I&#39;m currently working on a modified client for ModScape.</description>
