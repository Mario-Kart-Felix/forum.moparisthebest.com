    <title>[PI] Adding projectile to a custom (Zaryte bow)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-adding-projectile-to-a-custom-zaryte-bow/435103</link>
    <description>Hey, I have added the zaryte bow to my server and added a special. However, when I fire normally (without special attack) it preforms no projectile that hits the npc you are attacking but plays the animation and the npc is hit. How can you add a projectile to it? :S thanks

also, when using my special, the bar does not update and the attack can be used again and again ect. Any ideas? Thanks.

Again, when I attack something, I have to be right next to the npc I&#39;m attack and of course the bow is a ranged weapon and should be attack further away. 

I want to add a special that reduces the opponent&#39;s prayer level to 0. How could I do this?

Ps, anyone have any idea what the gfx for the zaryte bow? :S

Thanks in advance!</description>

<p>The Zaryte bow doesn’t have special by the way. And it’s just like the Crystal bow. No ammo and looks like the magic bow special with just one arrow and isn’t as fast.</p>

<p>Hey, I know it doesn’t have a special attack but I would like to add one. (drains prayer to 0) and I don’t know how to make the bow fire like the crystal bow.</p>
