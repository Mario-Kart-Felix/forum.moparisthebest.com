    <title>Allstar Source - Train - Barbarian Women Drops!?!?!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/allstar-source-train-barbarian-women-drops/371098</link>
    <description>[b]Mhk, so, I made a brand new server 3 days ago, and found out that in the partyhats are only 5m in the source which is easily achievable, so I wanted to make it where its Admin+, so I removed them from the rare shop, but found out that barbarian women drop red phats!!!!! I want to get rid of them dropping those, how do I do it? And also, if you know any other things that drop phats, let me know and post how to remove it!

Thanks in advanced.


I want to know fast because I have a mod, a admin, a co owner, and myself as owner, so thats all the staff we are having until 20+ players, so I need to know fast before we get new players! [/b]</description>

<p>I killed 36 of the barbâ€™s and none of them dropped a Party Hat after I edited it in the item2.java file. So, I think it worked,<br>
Many thanks.</p>
