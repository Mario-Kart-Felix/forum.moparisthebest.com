Are you an ADD patient by any chance? Mopar is a car parts company which has absolutely nothing to do with a game where you slave to pixels all day long. The only reason moparisthebest called it MoparScape was because he, as you may well have noticed, is a Mopar whore, and likes to spread the news.</p>

<p>Because then Jagex would sue Mopar for releasing a newer version of their game. Also this belongs in the RuneScape section.</p>
