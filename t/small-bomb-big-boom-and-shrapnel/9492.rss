    <description>I saw the topic on the miniature flamethrower and it took me back to my pyro days... Wait I&#39;m still a pyro. HA
[b]
Also, I will not be held liable for whomever you kill or injure or any ramifications thereof.  I repeat, this is dangerous shit, wear safety goggles the first few times and play it safe.[/b]

Anways, you&#39;ll need..

-Small co2 canister, used ones work better(can pickup at a big5 or anywhere that sells gas bb guns)Pic of one at bottom of page
-Cannon fuse (found at local army surplus, i&#39;ll also instruct you how to make some)
-Shot gun shells
-Scissors, sharp ones
-Ziploc bags
-Printer paper
-Power drill
-Vice
-Hammer
-Nail or screw
-Tape(optional, for louder boom)

Grab your shot guns shells and scissors! Start cutting the tops off (the top is the part that is all folded over on itself.) First you will come across a large amount of small bbs, drop them in one of the ziploc bags. There will be a clear plastic plug underneath the bbs, this plug can be a bitch so I would recommend needle nose pliers to get it out but they aren&#39;t needed. Lastly, out comes the gunpowder into a seperate ziploc. Repeat this with about 20-30 shells, depending on type of shot and whatnot they will have more or less gunpowder.

Now for the co2 canister. Get it in the vice so that the neck is pointed upwards at about a 70 degree angle away from your face! Take the screw or nail and tap it into the top of the co2 canister until it opens up a hole and lets out all the co2. This will scare the shit out of you the first time, you are warned! Now take the drill and make a hole about 1/8&quot; diameter where you poked it with the nail. Upright the co2 canister in the vice.

Take your printer paper and make a funnel. If you can&#39;t do this without another tutorial I congratulate you, for being a dumbass. Take your black powder ziploc and dump in enough to fill the co2 canister about 1/2 to 3/4. Pour a couple bbs in if you want, not recommended as they go EVERYWHERE.

Test out the cannon fuse to see how fast it burns. Cut a segment accordingly and put it in. Wala!  For a louder boom and less shrapnel, wrap the bitch in any sort of tape you can find and close up the hole around the fuse with the tape.

If you are going to make your own fuse then you&#39;ll need a bowl and cotton string. (a piece of you cotton shirt will work)  Mix black powder and water together in a bowl until it is fairly watery, start off with about 50/50 water and powder mix. Put your string in and really rub it into the mix, let it sit out over a night and maybe two if its not dry the next morning. The gunpowder should cling to the cotton and make a fuse. Test this stuff before you use it as it can be very flaky and different sections burn at faster or slower rates.

Good luck and if I left anything out let me know, I&#39;m doing this somewhat rushed. More to bomb recipes to come! This was just my favorite.

Edit: Added in a picture of me at work. As you can see, I&#39;m also tampering with a class B rocket and I made my own M100 casing. Which is the same as this co2 bomb but no shrapnel.

<p>also Ron if you wanted to really look like a terrorist you could cover your face up. go grab an Ak-47 (don’t how you would be able to do that, lol) strap c4 to yourself and run in the middle of your downtown screaming your head off. Of course. I doubt you’d get very far…</p>
