    <title>A couple of errors i need help with</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-couple-of-errors-i-need-help-with/6282</link>
    <description>Well basically, my server runs fine and everything , most things work but after i have played for a while my account which on my server is &#39;mod tom&#39; cant log in. i log in, i get disconnected, i log in get disconnected. which some would say is my server playing up ... but i made another account titled &#39; hello &#39; and i can play on that fine and it dosent disconnect ,

Also, the same thing happened to a friend on my server who had admin/owner status. He then created another account so he could actually play .. and i attempted to make him admin in the same way and it says everything is working, except when i compile and run server his rights go back to 0, 

Any help on either of the errors would be highly appreciated

thanks
