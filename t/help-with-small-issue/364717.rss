def login(player):
    player.getActionSender().sendMessage("&lt;shad=0066ff&gt;Check out our forums at&lt;img=1&gt;-asdforums.com-&lt;img=1&gt;");
    return</code><br>
Every player will get that message everytime they login, Dont do it every 10 seconds because that will be spamm and the players wont like it.</p>
