<li>Once you have bordered up the doors you will be safe from any player entering your base, unless they have an axe, in which case they are able to cut down your borders and gain access to your base</li>
<li>Note Destroying a bordered door can take up to 1 - 2 minutes, this time may change</li>
<li>A message is sent to the owner of the base if someone is trying to destroy the bordered door.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="52">
<li>Player Control Settings - A Dialogue is sent when pressing the “Close” button on the Task System Interface</li>

</ol>
<p>07/05/14<br>
54. Any level Player can attack a Player that is destroying a door - This is to prevent level 3’s destroying a level 100’s door and the level 100 not being able to stop him.</p>
<ul>
<li>Players can only attack them when they are actually destroying the door, attacking the player will not stop the player from destroying the door but killing them will.</li>
<li>If the Player destroying the door is being attacked he can either keep going and risk dying or he can stop - stopping will stop the player attacking him and he will be safe.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="55">

68. Weapon Poisoning - Use a weapon poison onto any poisonable weapon.<br>
69. Player Pickpocketing - Players can pickpocket any other player, similar to stealing creations but can be done everywhere</p>
<ul>
<li>Pickpocketing a player will result in the thief stealing a random item in the players inventory</li>
<li>Its only a basic system at the moment but I will add onto it by adding safety measures for the players who dont want to be pick pocketed, I thought of an idea - If a player has the item “nails” in their inventory then the thief will fail the pick pocket and will be dealt damage - the nails will then break etc.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="70">
<li>Players can carry “nails” in their inventory as a defence from thiefs (Pickpocket’s (Players))</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If a player is carrying 10 or more nails of any sort (Bronze, Iron, Steel, Black, Mithril etc) and a Player tries to pickpocket them then the thief will fail and will be dealt damage.</li>
<li>The damage is dependant upon the nails, for example rune nails will deal more damage than bronze nails</li>
<li>Bronze nails deal 10 damage, rune nails deal 70 damage</li>
</ul>
<p>29/05/14<br>
71. Added a starting tutorial for new players.<br>
72. Pickpocketing players now have a chance of failing, the higher thieving level the less you will fail.</p>

74. Added an Interface for players to view their current Knowledge in their skills.<br>
75. Having 1 Knowledge point in Fishing allows the player to catch 2 fish at a time when fishing</p>
<p>06/06/14<br>
76. Added a Title system for the Knowledge based skilling system, Titles are unlocked by having a certain knowledge level in that skill.<br>
77. Having a knowledge level of 4 in Fishing allows the player to not need fishing tools.</p>
<p>07/06/14<br>
78. In order to be able to pick another players pockets you must have a Knowledge level of 1 in Thieving.<br>
79. Level 2 Knowledge in Thieving grants more XP when Pickpocketing Players</p>
<ol start="80">
<li>Bordering Stairs, Ladders or Staircases require a Knowledge level of 1 in Construction - Doors do not require any knowledge levels.</li>
<li>Level 2 Knowledge in Construction grants more XP when bordering objects.</li>
</ol>
<p>11/06/14<br>
82. New Summoning System has been created thanks to furious3lf for the idea<br>
83. There are currently 6 different Guards<br>

90. - New Summoning Guards Have been added;</p>
<ul>
<li>The Hero - Summoning Level of 70 is required - Combat Level - 69;</li>
<li>The Elite Khazard Guard - Summoning Level of 80 is required - Combat Level - 95;</li>
<li>The Tyras Guard - Summoning Level of 90 is required - Combat Level - 110;</li>
</ul>
<ol start="91">
<li>Using a drink on a Summoning Guard will replenish the players Summoning Points</li>
</ol>
<p>29/06/14<br>
92. Summoning a Guard now requires coins, the amount is dependant upon the Guard, below are the current prices;<br>
Man - 500 Coins<br>
Farmer - 1,000 Coins<br>
Guard - 1,500 Coins<br>
Warrior Woman - 2,000 Coins<br>
White Knight Warrior - 2,500 Coins<br>
Paladin - 3,000 Coins<br>
Hero - 3,500 Coins<br>
Elite Khazard Guard - 4,000 Coins<br>
Tyras Guard - 4,500 Coins</p>
<ol start="93">
<li>
<p>Mini Help Quests - NPC’s will spawn in different location over a certain timescale, the NPC will be injured and that NPC will provide the player with a small quest such as;<br>
Give the man some water,<br>
Give the man some food,<br>
Kill a zombie that attacked him for “revenge”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of the farming patches have been added, except the tree patch (Will do that tomorrow)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Farming will benefit the players as it will allow them to grow crops that may be eaten, used for potions, used as explosives and even to create weapon poisons.</p>
<p>In order to make a weapon poison, you will need to obtain a vial of coconut milk and use it on a cactus spike, a vial of coconut milk can be made by farming the Palm tree and then harvesting the coconuts and then splitting them open, which will produce half a coconut, you can then use the coconut on an empty vial to make “Coconut Milk” (Like in RS). A cactus spike is obtained by farming a Cactus from the Cactus Patch in Al-kharid and can be used on the “Coconut Milk” to make a “Weapon Poison” which can then be used on a poison able weapon such as a Dragon Dagger, Dragon Spear, Rune Dagger, Iron Dagger etc</p>
<ol start="95">
<li>
<p>Me and Furious3lf have been going through the map and spawning Zombies and Mummies all across the World, the NPC spawns are “Almost” complete</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using an empty drink bottle/glass on a cactus in the desert will have a 1/4 chance of filling that drink up with water</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Farming Tree patches have been added, which leaves only the spirit tree patches and special patches left, which I’m not sure if I will add, but the Spirit Tree patch I will most likely add in a later stage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NPC Vs Zombie combat, Knights will attack zombies within a certain area of them - Defending their castle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Muggers, Muggers are a type of random event that will target a specific player that is online, the mugger will then run to that player and once in range will steal a random item from the players inventory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bones to peaches &amp; Bones to Bananas spell added</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>25/08/14</p>
<ol start="101">
<li>White Knight Events - 6 White Knights will spawn in a random city and will attack nearby Zombies, Players can then go to that city and help kill the zombies. Once the target zombie kills have been reached all the players that helped kill the zombies will be rewarded.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where if two NPC’s were fighting and a player killed one of the npcs then the player would not get the kill.</li>
</ol>
<p>27/08/14</p>
<ol start="103">
<li>Bounty System - Place a bounty on a players head, Killing that player will result in the player dropping that bounty on the floor as a reward for the bounty hunter</li>
</ol>

<p>Pet Hunting - I’ve created a system to catch different pets, I pretty much created a new hunter system, so It could be used for other npcs other than pets.<br>
Players can now set up a box trap in order to catch different pets, the current pets will be Gecko’s and Monkeys. There will be more such as Squirrels.</p>

<p>My opinion:</p>
<p>You die way to many times, also food is hardly to be found.<br>
Mini-map is black and is not making you able to localize yourself for a nearby city.<br>
The random stats after you died is something i don’t enjoy, you should keep the stats same with your banked items.</p>
<p>Also you should let players spawn somewhere with already some recourses. Not on a island near Falador.<br>
Took me a lot of effort to find my way to Falador and find no items.</p>

<p>There were a few Zombie Servers called Project Z, So I changed the name, There was a 317 which has/had nothing to do with this <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback, Although the Combat stat reset is there so people dont get to 138 combat level and have no risk when walking around. You keep your skill stats so train them as they will help in every way <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>But If you’ve ever played runescape before you should be able to navigate your way around the map, Also you have access to the World Map.</p>

<p>Yes the map is suppose to be black, you can unlock the map by finding two unique map pieces.</p>
