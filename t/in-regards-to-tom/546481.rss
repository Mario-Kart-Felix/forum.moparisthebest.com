    <title>In regards to tom</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/in-regards-to-tom/546481</link>
    <description>Against the backdrop of angry shouts rocking the country, a special tribunal demanded that a stern judgment should be meted out to the anti-party, counter-revolutionary faction led by tom.

The world public will never forget the malignant slanders uttered by tom, the enemy of the party and the revolution and a servant of the fascist clique of South Korea.

All the crimes committed by the accused will be proved in the course of the hearing and will be admitted to.

tom went so rude as to take in the middle even those things associated with intense loyalty and sincerity of our army and people towards the party and the leader and distribute them among confidants in an effort to take credit for doing so.

tom encouraged money-making under various pretexts to secure funds necessary for gratifying political greed and was engrossed in irregularities and corruption. tom thus took the lead in spreading indolent, careless and undisciplined virus in our society.

tom is isolated and snubbed, drenched various parts of the world in blood, and will feel the weapon of singlehearted unity.

tom behaved so arrogantly and insolently as unwillingly standing up from his seat and half-heartedly clapping, touching off towering resentment of our service personnel and people.

tom let the decadent capitalist lifestyle find its way to our society by distributing all sorts of pornographic pictures among personal confidants. tom led a dissolute, depraved life, squandering money at every stop.

All facts go to clearly prove that tom is a thrice-cursed traitor without an equal in the world, who had desperately worked for years to destabilize and bring down the DPRK. The hateful and despicable nature of these anti-party, anti-state and unpopular crimes will be fully disclosed in the course of the trial. No matter how much water flows under the bridge and no matter how frequently a generation is replaced by new one, the lineage of Paektu will remain unchanged and irreplaceable.

No one in the world can stand in the way of the army and people who are advancing single-mindedly united around supreme leader Kim Jong Un under the banner of great Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism.
