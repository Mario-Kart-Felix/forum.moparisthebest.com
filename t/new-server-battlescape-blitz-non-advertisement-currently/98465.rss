    <title>New server - BattleScape Blitz (non-advertisement currently)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-server-battlescape-blitz-non-advertisement-currently/98465</link>
    <description>Ok, Im moving in 3-4 weeks so that is when i plan on offically putting the server up (This way ill be running on a internet speed of 4000kbps &#39;or more depending if i decide to go with 8000kbps&#39; instead of my 40kbps).

I&#39;ve been working on this for about a month now. You may have seen an older psot here telling about a server in dev. calle dnot runescape. Renamed to BattleScape (the name of my very first server).

Basically the question is if i want to advertise this server for like an hour, should i place this in this thread of advertisement thread? (i may or may not put it up for an hour 2night and then wait till i move, but since i might im asking this)

EDIT: what im trying to ask is that does this deserve being posted in an advertise sectiopn were a huge number of people are when its an hour only thing till bout a month?</description>

              <p>Yes, just put it in the Server Advertisment. Just make sure you put on the thread that it is only a beta test that will put up for about an hour.</p>
