              <p>find the variable that determines a donator… then in actionhandler where you open the shop.</p>
<p>if (c.isdonator) {<br>
c.getShops().openShop(id);<br>
}</p>
<p>or it could be like</p>
<p>if (c.isdonator &gt;= 1) {<br>
c.getShops().openShop(id);<br>
}</p>
<p>edit: didnt read full post…</p>
<p>in the shophandler, or shopassistant (forgot which)</p>
<p>find the buyitem method</p>
<p>if (c.myShopId = shopid &amp;&amp; !c.isDonator) {<br>
c.sendMessage("You have to donate to buy from this shop);<br>
return;<br>
}</p>
<p>^ somthing like this but variable naming and methods will prob be different depending on your source.</p>
