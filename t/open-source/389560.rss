    <description>Do you think open source for RSC private servers is a good thing or a bad thing?

[b]Pros[/b]
You can allow people to develop the source code without worrying about it being leaked (it&#39;s pretty much impossible to develop big things without the full, running source code).
It could entice more developers to get involved by being able to play around with the code.

[b]Cons[/b]
Other servers could simply run the server and be competition, stealing years of hard work.
It would make life for bot creators a lot easier.
People could use the code to find exploits that otherwise wouldn&#39;t be known.

I like the idea and I&#39;m completely with Peeter&#39;s thinking (and what he did with DarkQuest) but then the RSC scene lacks any real development anyway so what&#39;s the point? No one helped Peeter with DarkQuest so it all seems a bit pointless, especially when you consider that no-one even uses the source code today (everyone uses RSCAngel instead).

It seems like being a one-man-band is the way forward. What do you think?</description>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/kryptix">@Kryptix</a> you sit here and complain a lot saying people need help over teamview etc, they don’t even know what they are doing on pc, this is why you create a few tutorials on your forums like…“Client Information” How to update the client when needed…blah blah blah. Or a simple client updater + tutorial can do the job. “But no they still don’t know what to do” well…this simply gets rid of the idiots out of the community which means your community average IQ is gonna rise. I have NEVER seen a server complain about how client updates are bad which is why I find it funny.</p>

<p>For everything he comes up with to detect/prevent botting there will be a way to counter it…  You can’t guarantee that the client isn’t modified, and even if you could there are other things that can be done that Java can’t even hope to detect without making native calls.  Then you just switch to an OS/architecture that isn’t supported, or bypass it like they do for things like GameGuard.</p>

RSCE (from the last time i looked at it, was the worst out of all of them. This was due to Zilent being very new to Java when he performed his updates, not knowing a lot about Java he went against a lot of conventions and Java standards. this might be different now but in the end, all 4 of these servers worked fine)</p>
<p>If i were to write a server from scratch right now, it would beat every server now. In 1 year i’d look back at that and think ‘shit, i could do a lot better now’. As time passes things change.</p>
<p>You guys are arguing pointless, everyone is using RSCD from the start therefore it’s stupid to go to extents of rewriting the entire thing, your best off writing one from scratch. I’m surprised Peeter spent that much time fixing up RSCA to DQ anyway, sure it’s neater but overall it’s still Reines code.</p>
<p>With RSCA i spent my time fixing bugs, adding new content and developing to how the structure of the source was already set up. I didn’t go out of my way to rewrite the entire thing to fit my needs, i went with the flow of what was there. In the end everything worked out fine.</p>

</aside>
<p>They’re already in RSCE though. That’s my point. Yes that can be ‘easierly’ implemented but by who? It requires work. All skills can be easily implemented into a bare source but it takes time and effort which most people aren’t prepared to put in. You put out a request for a Runecrafting plugin to be written and <span class="bbcode-b">no-one</span> contributed. What’s the point of having a plugin system if you have to write everything yourself anyway?</p>

<p>The client is arguably just as important as the server. RSCE’s client is so much nicer to use than RSCD’s, more features, sleeker, closer to RSC, more stable, etc.</p>

<p>It does everything I need it to do. I haven’t felt any need to change or write an independent website. I don’t really get what you mean, if you include the forum from another directory you essentially can do whatever you want…</p>

<p>Not really, I’m maintaining and extending it fine. People have put up with RSCD for years just fine. How much further do you need to extend anyway? It’s very unlikely any other server (other than RSCE) will ever see 300+ online again so it’s more than sufficient IMO.[/quote]</p>
<p>A new developer writes a new skill for you. This skill will be written into 17 different classes. After a month of running it on your live server you discover it has a crucial flaw and needs to be removed. You have to manually rip out the changes in 17 different classes to restore the core to it’s original state. In ripping out code from 17 classes you also accidentally ripped out a crucial bit of code that results in another bug.</p>
<p>A bunch of developers write 20 new skills for you. All of them require changes in 20 different classes. Each time a new skill or anything new is added your classes grow. At one point you have 20 classes with 10k lines in them.</p>
<p>This is what I’m talking about when I say hard to maintain.</p>

<p>Thieving and agility are basically plugins that can be implemented a lot easierly in DQ then they’re implemented in RSCE/RSCA. The same goes with quests.</p>
<p>There’s also no point in mentioning client side modifications, as they have nothing to do with your servers source.</p>
<p>As for the website modifications since you’re using the fluxbb forum software as your base it’s extremly hard to build anything new ontop of that (a pitfall most RSCD servers follow, including DQ/RSCA).</p>
<p>All in all you’re providing a ready to run setup that’s hard to maintain and extend.</p>

He thought everyone would program the source for him and just provide him with the plug-in but no-one provided anything so it was all a waste of time.[/quote]<br>
How the plugins are loaded? from jars? or are they just hardcoded into the source?</p>

<p>Kryptix, I’d go open source if not only for the fact that people that would like to see how it works, but also for people that would like to jump in and help.  Going open source means you can have far more people to look through the program and help find bugs/other problems and either commit their own fix or just tell you about it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You’re right, it would be really nice but it would also go against me to, allowing people to run their own copy of RSCEmulation and essentially being competition in a matter of minutes. Plus, there’s always the malicous people that wouldn’t tell you and merely try and abuse anything they find.[/quote]Yea, that’s always the chance you have to take, but it happens with everything.  I know people that take AbiWord’s source code, make a binary, and release it under a different name (under the same licensing though, of course); The fact is that your repository should still advance faster than anyone else that is trying to compete by using yours, especially if you get people to tag along and actually contribute.  Although, after I found out about this guy doing the AbiWord thing, I did pretty much turn my back on open sourcing much, but in my opinion, a private server wouldn’t be too bad of a thing, unless you’re making a lot of money from it or something (I really don’t know, I’m hardly ever around these parts anymore lol)</p>
