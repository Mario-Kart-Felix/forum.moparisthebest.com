<li>
<p>Full Runecrafting, DM arena, web &lt;&gt; game communication, batched events, lottery system, clan system and so on are not ‘XML updates’ or ‘small edits to the commandHandler class’ (it also amused me that you decided to format the class name as a method and not a class)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It takes far more than Java knowledge to run a successful server. PHP is arguably just as important, as is MySQL, server management, community leadership, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have no idea what my source is like… It’s by far the best source in the RSC private server scene and constantly progressing. There’s always room for improvement though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have had 384 unique IP’s online before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Players quit if no progress is made.[/quote]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refer to my last point about you using random points to give the false sense that you’re winning. XML or database; You knew what I was referring to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Runecrafting was already done in another source. Copy and pasting can be easily done. DM area is a very small amount of work, hardly worth mentioning. Everything else you mentioned I’d be willing to bet my life that you had help. Although I cannot prove that you did, you’ll use that to your advantage and deny it like you do everything. You did though, not a doubt in my mind. As for as:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>“(it also amused me that you decided to format the class name as a method and not a class)”</p>
<p>I’m not even sure what you mean here. I don’t think you know either.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>We’re not talking about PHP, leadership or anything thing else other than java as said before. Pay attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’ve already called you on your source and you completely ignored it. You simply do not have the “best source”, nor is it even close.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Care to prove it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read this and the last page again. This time pay attention.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Kryptix, post:20, topic:389572”]2. If you compared the two you will see that my version is clearly superior in every way. Pretty much everything I mentioned had been done before, why did you only mention Runecrafting? Also, you got the order of complexity completely wrong: batched events was by far the easiest thing to add.</p>
<p>According to programming standards methods should be formatted likeThis() and class names should be formatted LikeThis. You went to the effort of capitalizing the second word which is why it amused me when you formatted a class name like a method.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>You may be talking about Java but I’m talking about everything that is required to develop/maintain and keep a RSC private server online and progressing. You could be the best Java programmer in the world but without knowledge in other areas you wouldn’t get very far.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What’s the best source then? Even if it was 2nd or 3rd it would be close to being the best so I’m curious to which other RSC private server source codes are better? Could you enlighten us?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How could I possibly prove it? No matter what I post you would have a answer for… We had 530+ players online and when a query was ran to see how many IP’s were unique it returned 384. If you don’t want to believe that then it’s up to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have read your post but you’re wrong. You haven’t run a successful server so you wouldn’t know. As I said before I haven’t even heard of you before.[/quote]</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That picture of 500 online proves what exactly?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>I have never, and will never log into your game. So that I cannot see for myself. You might have edited the locations, how many runes per, etc. It’s still small edits not even worth mentioning. It proves nothing.<br>
The order of complexity was not in my mind at the time of typing it. Since you missed it, I went in the order of how you listed them. Runecrafting, DM arena, etc. Furthermore, I didn’t <span class="bbcode-u">only</span> mention Runecrafting, I mentioned the DM arena as well. Pay attention dude, that shit is getting old.<br>
ONCE AGAIN, you’re pulling random points for that false sense. You’re trying too hard and yet missing the point of what I’m saying. As far as not capitalizing the C; Who cares? Only someone desperately looking for things to point out (like a grammar nazi) would notice that, which further proves my previous points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We’re only talking about java here, don’t try and stretch what we’re talking about. Lol. And you’re wrong about that. Yes, people look for programmers with experience in other languages and what/not. It’s not required. You may want to look that up before you argue that again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m not going to give names of private developers, hence the word <span class="bbcode-b">private</span>. It’s not the best source dude. I really can’t say that enough. If you want to argue about this, how about you tell me what’s so special about the source. What do you have in there that no one else has. Explain yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moving on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So you’re implying that the <span class="bbcode-b">only</span> way to know if players quit because of lack of updates is if I’m an administrator to a server? That’s retarded and you know it.</p>

        <p>Intoxication:</p>
<p>I simply can not wrap my mind around how somebody can be so arrogant yet have no way to back his arrogance up. I’ve never met an idiot as big as you on these forums, <span class="bbcode-b">Moparscape</span>. Do you realize what it even takes to become the ‘village idiot’ of a site that is home to things like ‘delta scape and silab items’?</p>
<p>I’ve been using this site for 5 years now and never have a seen somebody argue against a point as established as the one your arguing against. It’s obvious to everybody on this scene (except for you apparently) that RSCEmulation is by far the most closely replicated <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=runescape+classic" data-bbcode="true">RSC server</a>. Notice that RSCE is the only RSC private server on that list, thats some pretty concrete evidence that RSCE is better then anything that this community has provided in regards to RSC.</p>
<p>On another note; you claim that Kryptix makes posts that take too long to read? I read the last 2 pages of this thread in under 5 minutes. So like I said earlier, either your the village idiot and you can’t read properly or you are simply so close minded that you refuse to read the very posts that you are trying to argue against. If you ever plan to actually win a debate then you should realize that there are 2 sides to every story and you need to listen to both sides to have a well formulated opinion (something you obviously don’t have).</p>
<p>Oh, and another thing; ‘commandHandler’ - Like Kryptix stated, its obvious you went to the effort of not capitalizing the ‘c’, as you would do with a class file in Java, and then taking the effort to capitalize the ‘h’, as you would do with the second (third, fourth, etc) word of a method in Java. It appears to me (perhaps everyone that has read this thread other then you) that you did this to try and sound smarter but in-fact it only pointed out your lack of knowledge on the subject at hand.</p>
<p>You also continue to claim the far fetched idea that somebody, you?, is developing a ‘secret’ server that is far beyond the development of RSCEmulation. If you don’t mind could you post some proof of this development, a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI8LJYi8VY8" data-bbcode="true">video</a> perhaps, just like Kryptix does on a regular basis.</p>
<p>If you ignore this post or simply reply with a ‘td;dr’ then everyone from this point on will realize that all arguments that you bring forth are nothing more then a fallacious hope to prove a point that is obviously not true.</p>

<p>I simply can not wrap my mind around how somebody can be so arrogant yet have no way to back his arrogance up. I’ve never met an idiot as big as you on these forums, <span class="bbcode-b">Moparscape</span>. Do you realize what it even takes to become the ‘village idiot’ of a site that is home to things like ‘delta scape and silab items’?[/quote]</p>
<p>Don’t care for your opinion.</p>

<p>I’ve been using this site for 5 years now and never have a seen somebody argue against a point as established as the one your arguing against. It’s obvious to everybody on this scene (except for you apparently) that RSCEmulation is by far the most closely replicated <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=runescape+classic" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">RSC server</a>. Notice that RSCE is the only RSC private server on that list, thats some pretty concrete evidence that RSCE is better then anything that this community has provided in regards to RSC.</p>

<p>You obviously cannot read properly. We’re talking in terms of stability, not just a bunch of XML (or database if you want to be technical) edits and whatever else you would think replicates the game. He cannot keep his game up for more than 2 days straight. That’s not the best source, not even close. Blah fucking blah.</p>

<p>On another note; you claim that Kryptix makes posts that take too long to read? I read the last 2 pages of this thread in under 5 minutes. So like I said earlier, either your the village idiot and you can’t read properly or you are simply so close minded that you refuse to read the very posts that you are trying to argue against. If you ever plan to actually win a debate then you should realize that there are 2 sides to every story and you need to listen to both sides to have a well formulated opinion (something you obviously don’t have).</p>

<p>Oh, and another thing; ‘commandHandler’ - Like Kryptix stated, its obvious you went to the effort of not capitalizing the ‘c’, as you would do with a class file in Java, and then taking the effort to capitalize the ‘h’, as you would do with the second (third, fourth, etc) word of a method in Java. It appears to me (perhaps everyone that has read this thread other then you) that you did this to try and sound smarter but in-fact it only pointed out your lack of knowledge on the subject at hand.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>WHO the hell cares? Only you and Kryptix… No one else. Whoa I didn’t capitalize a C but I did an H. Big deal, get over it kid. I’m not programming java on this forum right this second. I don’t need to be completely technical.</p>

<p>You also continue to claim the far fetched idea that somebody, you?, is developing a ‘secret’ server that is far beyond the development of RSCEmulation.
