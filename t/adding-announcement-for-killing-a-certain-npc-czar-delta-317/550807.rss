    <title>Adding announcement for killing a certain NPC [Czar/Delta] [317]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-announcement-for-killing-a-certain-npc-czar-delta-317/550807</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been having trouble making it so when you kill an NPC, it will send an announcement to the whole server letting you know that the NPC has been killed. Whether you know how to do it with allstar, czar, delta etc it all would help as I can just fit the code around the base i&#39;m using. Thanks in advance</description>

<p>Incorrect. That would check it every single time a player hits/attacks an npc.<br>
You only want it sent <span class="bbcode-i">when the NPC dies</span>, so it’s best to handle it in the code where the npc’s death is handled. Like I said above.</p>

<p>I <em>believe</em> there is an NPC class (NPC.java) somewhere in your server… Could you look in there and see if it has an IsDead boolean, or something of similar sort?</p>
<p>If it does… You could change the code to this:</p>
<p><code>if (server.npcHandler.npcs[attacknpc].npcType == 1645 &amp;&amp; server.npcHandler.npcs[attacknpc].IsDead) {

}</code></p>
<p>The reason it doesn’t work currently is because the “IsDead” variable is probably related to the Client object (A.K.A, the player). So that boolean is only true when the player dies, or false when they’re currently alive. Hence why it constantly sends as you attack the monster.</p>
<p>Have you tried dying while attacking said monster? I bet (with the current code) it will probably send your message.[/quote]<br>

<p>Thanks for your quick reply Sk8r, this is the code I made:</p>
<p><code>if (server.npcHandler.npcs[attacknpc].npcType == 1645)
{	
if (IsDead == true)
{				
PlayerHandler.messageToAll = ("The xxxx has been slain by " + playerName);				
}
}</code></p>
<p>I put it underneath where it makes sure slayer monsters cannot be attacked if you don’t have the required slayer level.</p>
<p>Also if I just change “IsDead” to false, when I attack the monster it sends the message, so the code must partly work, I suppose</p>
