    <title>Quest Log</title>

    <description>Hey there, I was coding a new quest when I noticed that some quests that I can&#39;t even find in my source, such as &quot;Prince Ali Rescue&quot; Are in my quest log when certain quests arent completed. I&#39;ve checked my client.java,texthandler,clickingmost,player.java.. And &quot;Prince Ali rescue wasn&#39;t anywhere to be found.
Anyone know which file i could find it?</description>
