    <description>Ok.
I&#39;m lds. I walk around school and people look down at me like I&#39;m some kind of devil. I mean, I never did anything to offend anyone. Well, At least try not to..  Do you have a problem with Mormons? Why do you think people hate the religion? Why do you think people want to yell at us every chance they get?
P.S. I&#39;ll be surprised if Ron doesn&#39;t say something about how they should be treated the same.</description>

Ron, The LDS church doesn’t squeeze money out of you.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I’m not slamming LDS. I’m slamming EVERY religion. Religion is a scam. ALL religion is a scam. I’m an atheist, I can’t help slamming religion becuase I’d rather use the money for better reasons. Like spending it on my car, or giving it to charity litterally by giving it to the homeless people I see when we go to NY or something. Not by some organization that are obviously not giving ALL their money away. Someone gets a cut.</p>
<p>In Chrisitianity it goes to the Pope. That’s where I’m coming from.</p>
<p>In a church ever notice how they come at you looking for money by going from person to person instead of having a box in a corner where you can give donations? That’s because if you don’t donate then you look bad, so normally when you go to church, you always expect to give money. Normally $5 or more per family.</p>
<p>RELIGION IS A SCAM. I don’t care how religious you are, it’s still a scam. Save your money, god isn’t going to save you. I’m sure a lot of people prayed at New Orleans and they got shafted. I’m sure a lot of people prayed at Vietnam and they got shafted.</p>
<p>~Ron[/quote]<br>
Go Ron!<br>
Im an aethist too, i think god is a scam</p>
<p>And same thing weith santa, that fag never gave me my money</p>

<p>That’s because if someone close to you is dying, most people are willing to try ANYTHING to help them.

<p>Religion isnt a scam to me. It’s how I live my life. Being LDS, it gives me higher standards to live by. Not to be stupid and have sex at 15 years old and get my GF pregnant.

<p>Bah humbug. I use my own mind and principles of good etiquette to follow. I don’t need a silly book or some preacher to tell me what to do. I’m glad it works for you. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> But it just doesn’t work for me. And my face, is FREE! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Yeah I know. But that’s what I want. I don’t want some afterlife. If I die of old age, I would want to die. I don’t want to go to god. I hear there are no drugs allowed. All the parties are in hell. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Plus since I’m hindu, and atheist lol, I’m supposed to believe that Earth is my hell. And as I go through hell, once I go through all my ‘different’ lives, and in any of them, I am perfectly good, I will then go up to meet god. Sounds silly, but hey, every religion is different.</p>
<p>And that is why I’m atheist. Cause it’s all full of crap to me. But seriously, I’m glad it works for you. I think I used to be much happer when I did believe in god, and did believe in an afterlife, and when my relatives died, I did believe that they were in a better place. When really they were cremated into dust or burried into the ground getting eaten by worms. Can’t you tell I’m a real optimist? :rolleyes:</p>

<p>Well then tell me how religion isn’t a scam? Tell me how god “needs” the money. Tell me why we can’t tax any religious building?</p>
<p>Edit: I just read marluxia’s post. Nice joke lol. You’re right. Humanity has grown in many ways, but we bomb each other rather than uniting to advance further into technology and to make improvements so we can achieve that utopia in which everyone desires. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Ron, The LDS church doesn’t squeeze money out of you.</p>

<p>I’m not slamming LDS. I’m slamming EVERY religion. Religion is a scam. ALL religion is a scam. I’m an atheist, I can’t help slamming religion becuase I’d rather use the money for better reasons. Like spending it on my car, or giving it to charity litterally by giving it to the homeless people I see when we go to NY or something. Not by some organization that are obviously not giving ALL their money away. Someone gets a cut.</p>
<p>In Chrisitianity it goes to the Pope. That’s where I’m coming from.</p>
<p>In a church ever notice how they come at you looking for money by going from person to person instead of having a box in a corner where you can give donations? That’s because if you don’t donate then you look bad, so normally when you go to church, you always expect to give money. Normally $5 or more per family.</p>
<p>RELIGION IS A SCAM. I don’t care how religious you are, it’s still a scam. Save your money, god isn’t going to save you. I’m sure a lot of people prayed at New Orleans and they got shafted. I’m sure a lot of people prayed at Vietnam and they got shafted.</p>

              <p>Ron, The LDS church doesn’t squeeze money out of you. We pay freely. We pay 10% on everything we earn. Expect Gambling. The LDS church also funds a lot of things other churches dont. Such as, Food for Homeless, We have our own cannery and we give thousands of food to homeless every month. We give to charity.[size=72pt][font=Verdana] We also DONT PAY OUR BISHOPS.[/font][/size]</p>
