    <title>Extract cache</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/extract-cache/450468</link>
    <description>Well, I could use some teamviewer help with extracting my cache.

I&#39;m actually Windows XP so these tutorials I looked up aren&#39;t really helping me &gt;-&gt;

Also, My User.Js gives me this error, if someone would help with that...

I:\user.js
Line: 1
Char: Object expected
Code: 800A138F
Source: Microsoft JScript runtime error

So if someone could teamview and help me extract this Cache, that would be great.

And if someone has a clue on how to fix this User.js,
then that would be very helpful.
Thanks.</description>
