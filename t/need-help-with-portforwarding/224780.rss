              <p>When you log in on your wireless one and it doesnt work cuz of Username and Pass problem.</p>
<p>That means it is wrong, and its not changed, it usually is the username is admin and the pass is admin as well.</p>
<p>If not then the pass is changed.</p>
<p>For your Netcomm one, i do not know how to help you in it BUT, you may search it on google or any site.</p>
