    <title>Need help with portforwarding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-portforwarding/246530</link>
    <description>ive tried atleast 20 guides on how to make a private server. i finaly made one after about 3 months of trying, but when i run it it works fine for me but no-one else can connect ive been through my portforward settings and as far as i know they look like its right and i set up my firewall aswell
maybe someone could help me? maybe use teamviewer and connect to my computer and do it for me? i dont mean to be lazy but a lot of guides ive looked at dont help me to much and im pullign my hair out over this.
many thanks in advance.

              <p>ye in no-ip duc my ip is there i knew there was something wrong with portforward just wasnt sure what. any chance you could say a little on how i add it to outgoing? if its not too much trouble itf it is then ill just have 2 stop being lazy and work it out.</p>
<p>edit: just looked and it says outbound and its the same as my inbound so im gona guess that its set up for inbound and outbound</p>
