              <p>just go to your cmd and look at your IPV4 Adress and use that in your ip for portforwarding<br>
most routers let you go to the site 192.168.1.1 others have 192.168.0.1 try one next you<br>
wanna go to your portforwarding/ whatever else it says set your ports to single set your<br>
TCP/UDP to both so it connects no matter what and finally you save setting reset no-ip or hamachi<br>
whichever you using and start your server up your server should work then</p>
