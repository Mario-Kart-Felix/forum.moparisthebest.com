<p>uTorrent files may be infected (be careful wich site you get it from), so be careful, plus uTorrent is illegal as far as i know, so watch what you’re doing with it.</p>

              <p>Should’ve used search first, but i reccomend searching “howto portforward” / something on the lines of this.</p>
<p>Also, ‘Need Help :O’ (As suggested in your subject name) Isn’t much of a title.<br>
Change it to ‘Need IP Help’ or something like that, and you’ll get less ignorance. MoparScapers with brains like to help the people out with half a brain.<br>
Not no brain atall.</p>
