    <title>Question on joining a server wid [HAM]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-on-joining-a-server-wid-ham/24724</link>
    <description>Hey, my friend is making a server using HAM... I think I heard somewhere that you should have a router to use a HAM server. I don&#39;t have one tho... Does that mean I won&#39;t be able to use his server? If I can use HAM is there a risk in downloading it? Using it?

Please hurry on your anwser!  :(
