    <title>Hi guys</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hi-guys/412293</link>
    <description>have a little bit of a problem, i have 2 hard drives from my old computer that i wanted to transfer the stuff on those hard drives, to my new computer. i put the first one in replace of the d drive it worked fine. but now i put the other in and it won&#39;t work. the device installed correctly, i&#39;m using the same cables but the driver won&#39;t show up. i don&#39;t know if its cause its not in slave? (there aren&#39;t any jumpers) or that maybe the drivers didn&#39;t install correctly cause last time they made me restart before i did anything.
inb4 your an idiot, all that other shit.
any help is welcomed.</description>

<p>Also, for option two, just make two trips <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>Yes, and I suppose I could do that, but thats alot of work. I dunno, If I still can’t I’ll end up doing it.<br>
I went to the winblows thing, and checked the status. It says its working, though when I try and populate it, nothing happens… which makes me think it can’t read it. I uninstalled the drivers and reinstalled them, disabled and enabled, nothing is working. Its weird, the harddrive in my coumputer and the one I’m trying to xfer stuff off are both seagate. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>edit: the other (good) harddrive is only 80 gigs, I have like 120 gigs of stuff on my old pc. :\</p>

              <p>Put them both in your old computer, transfer everything to the drive the works in the new computer, and install the old good drive in the new pc?</p>
<p>In your new pc, are you using the same connectors for the second drive as you used for the first drive that worked?</p>
