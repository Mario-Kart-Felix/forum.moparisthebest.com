          <blockquote>
              <p>I don’t think the community has grown to tolerate “the stupidity of pwnd” but rather pwnd has grown to tolerate the stupidity of this community. I’m using pwnd to respresent a lot of us. Most of us who have been here <a href="http://pre-mitb.com" rel="nofollow noopener">pre-mitb.com</a>, were completely different people back then. The community was better, there was no reason to act stupid.</p>
<p>I’m trying hard not to look for trouble anymore. Instead of being the first to call someone an idiot, I just dont reply anymore. I recently re-read the black book of rs cheating word for word and realized a few things which I can’t describe. But it definitely sparked nostalgia. I have no interest in cheating but I think everyone could benefit reading it again. I’ll upload version 5 later.</p>
<p>There’s inspiration in that book. It’s filled with spelling and grammar errors, and a lot is just cows point of view.</p>
<blockquote>Cow kindly allowed me to add this chapter to his black book. So, what's going on? As many of you know, I have already left IRC, I haven't worked on SCAR for a long time and now I only reside in AutoRune channel. My purpose in this cheating community from the very beginning was to educate the cheaters. To get out of their heads that stupid ideology they have had for too long time: Download, run, hope it's not a trojan. From the very beginning my cheats were different. All cheats before AutoRune were simple (alas Nick's autominer) - you launched them and pressed the button - it was running. My cheats required scripting which is a step to programming. Now many of the cheaters can script and program, they can remove rotating map from mudclient and create justclient without my help, there are several very good JAVA programmers... I am not necessary for this community to exist. In fact there are several sub communities - SCARers, ITers, RBers and ARers. My leaving won't even affect 3 of those (not even SCARers since SCAR source code has been published).
I could not decide if I should say this or not. I will. The main reason why I leave is, I'm different than you. Why am I cheating? It's an intellectual challenge for me. I am not doing it for money or skills, no. That's why many people could not understand how can it not feel bad getting my character banned (99 mining, 86 smithing, 60 mill GPs). I have seen you lie. I have seen you scam. I have seen you fight. I don't like it. I hoped you would change. I still do.
However I wish RuneScape cheating a long life. Remember guys, you used to be like those n00bs that join our channels and ask for cheats to be sent to their e-mail. Look at yourself now. Look at how clever you have become, how much you know, how much you can tell and do. You are the best when you want to. And you are the best. You are member of the most powerful RuneScape cheating community ever. Always remember that!
<p>Kaitnieks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How is that not inspiration to do better here. The whole book is rs cheating rising, falling, rising, falling, etc. And even if you remember reading the book or you lived through it yourself, read it again.</p>
