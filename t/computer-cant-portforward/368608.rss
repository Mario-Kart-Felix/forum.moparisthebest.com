    <title>Computer can&#39;t portforward =[</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/computer-cant-portforward/368608</link>
    <description>When I portforward using my laptop&#39;s IP it works fine, the ports are open and all. But when I portforward using my hosting computer&#39;s IP the ports won&#39;t open at all for some reason and I do not understand why. So thinking it may be my router, I switch connections to my neighbor&#39;s which is very good connection and try to open a port and when I do, it still says the port is not open. So there is something wrong with my computer... Can anyone help me please?

If you can, add me on MSN :)
