    <title>AncientScape Enhanced : The Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ancientscape-enhanced-the-server/115304</link>
    <description>Okay, some of you may heard of an old server called AncientScape which had 85+ members on hosted by me, right? Now it is turning into a great project made by me. [b]AncientScape Enhanced[/b]. I just started today and I have got some decent stuff in.

[u]Updates[/u]

[i]No cheat client party hat spawning will work.[/i]
[i]Range has been fully removed.[/i]
[i]Several items like a perfect ring, white, and black have been given needed requirements to fit their riggness. Only the owner can wear a perfect ring and only administrators can wear white and black.[/i]
[i]Some item commands have been added.[/i]

[b]Not much yet, just started. Getting all the starting stuff together. Like menu&#39;s, and all the like.[/b]

[u]Future Updates (not in any order)[/u]

[i]Make it so if people log on to the server while in beta test that aren&#39;t supposed to they will get disconnected.[/i]
[i]A minigame called H.A.M. vs M.A.H..[/i]
[i]Barrows the real way.[/i]
[i]A lot of 100% working skills.[/i]
[i]Perhaps add a real Runescape quest or two.[/i]
[i]Fix some glitches.[/i]
[i]Add some more commands and stuff.[/i]

[b]I would have more, but I need ideas for new skills and minigames. Please post here with ideas and they will be put into consideration. Thank you.[/b]

If you want to beta test, post here! The server will be officially out on all of the server lists in a week or two. But until then, you can still secretly play on the server in beta test. 
[u]Up to 4 people can beta test and you must have AIM or MSN.[/u]

[b]It also has a server site hosted with GoDaddy and a .org domain which will be released after it is out of beta testing.[/b]

<p>Or I can just make it if the person’s name isn’t one that I want to log on it will disconnect them.[/quote]<br>
People can always send a fake packet to the server and use that second or two of the server checking the packet to brute a username in that is on your list … I’m just thinking that the CD Key type auth would be more secure.</p>

<p>So you can publically release it, but only certain people have access to play. (I saw the idea from Sam Server via Rune-Server.)</p>
<p>Make an Auth class that will require any new player that logs in to enter a four digit (or however many digits you want, kind of like a CD KEY) to play if they cannot enter it or the key is not on the list they automatically get jailed. It’s a pretty self explanatory system + it would keep out people that you don’t want to be in there when the Beta is up.</p>
