Ive never seen a player named Jbolsahck and its odd to me the other permissions are all long time players.

<p>If you think about it logically it makes perfect sense, if there are multiple XP farms then the chance of another person being at a different location within the end is increased, whereas if there is just one XP farm it allows everyone to use the XP farm thus eliminating pretty much any chance of the spawn rates being ruined.</p>

<p>Far from it, what would have been selfish is if i denied access to it from the get-go, im not selfish for closing it after actions other members have done to anger me or other members of ‘the castle crew’; im not talking about some random person either.</p>

<p>Quite frankly, it isn’t fair that you dive in first and then deny the community a right to use the end to its full potential.

<p>What??? lol? Before i start even listing other points, id like to add that most of you (tarkoff, relmitos, tom, etc) <span class="bbcode-i">rarely</span> went into the end before knowing about this xp farm.</p>
<p>With that being said, how is our removal of use of the xp farm from you unfair/taking potential from the end? You are still able to venture in the end as you always have.</p>
<p>It isnt your right to use the farm, because its completely possible to build and use another farm in a different location, just hope nobobdy else logs in <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
