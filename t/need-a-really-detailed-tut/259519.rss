    <description>Hey guys, it&#39;s been a while since i was coding, so ive forgotten how 2 add... commands... This has been bugging me!

I need some1 to completly refresh my brain, basically, it&#39;s going to be like teaching a baby to eat it&#39;s dinner :D

Ok, this is what i need help with

How to lay out commands (like [code]else if (command.startsWith(&quot;pickup&quot;) &amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt;= 2)) {[/code] 

I need to know how to add stuff like that, but as ::starter which can only be used once.

I also need to know how to do tele commands.

Finally, ive never been able to work this one out :(

When you type ::info    or    ::rules   it brings up a list of rules and stuff, like a command list.

Thanks for reading and im hoping somebody will help me out ^^

(For you searching noobs, i have searched the forums and all i could find out was how to add commands, i thought this was the one for me! Clicked it and i figured the thread had been removed... So theres no need to tell me 2 search)
