    <description>well first thing is first i have a few source/clients in mind from the downloadable ones on mopars download list.
but everytime i try to change the programming into my name i never can get it to run right i need help i have alot of money to support the server after i get it up and running but im a newb at programming and setting this all up so i need someone to help/teach me for an amazing server if you help you will automatically get a admin/programmer spot for the server i just need help learning and getting started. i have many great ideas. i have probably played almost every server that has somewhat popularity and know what everybody wants. now i just need a team to direct.
