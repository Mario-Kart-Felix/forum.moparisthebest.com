    <description>No crediting me at all,creds go to zappacky from rs-resources.



&lt;blockquote&gt;Ok this is for Winbloze users who want an easy to use proxy that never needs to be changed. If you use linux, scroll to the botton under [NOTE]

First off, go to [url=http://tor.eff.org]tor.eff.org[/url]. Click download. Then click on this link:

[URL=http://img480.imageshack.us/my.php?image=tor18by.gif][img]http://img480.imageshack.us/img480/901/tor18by.th.gif[/img][/URL]

Hit run when the box pops up, and when it is done downloading hit yes if it asks. 

You should now have a window open that says &quot;Tor-TorCP-Privoxy Bundle Setup Window&quot; in the title bar. Click next. Choose custom from the drop down box, and uncheck Privoxy. Hit next. Hit install unless you need to change the install location. It will install tor. Make sure the &quot;Run installed components now&quot; box is checked, then hit Finish. A little onion will appear in the systen tray:

To exit tor, simply right click on the onion and hit Exit. To restart it go to Start, All Programs, Tor, and click on Tor. 

Now, to make Aryan use it. 

Open your Run-Bot.bat file, or whatever filename you are using, in notepad. Replace the line with &quot;java&quot; in it with this code (borrowed and modified from theman12345&#39;s tutorial):

[code]
@echo off
title Running Bot
java -DsocksProxyHost=127.0.0.1 -DsocksProxyPort=8118 -noverify -Xmx500m -cp .;./OUTPUT;./OUTPUT/unrenamed.jar;./BotClasses; Bot
pause
[/code]

For IMP\slave_bot users :
[code]
@echo off
title Running Bot
start javaw -DsocksProxyHost=127.0.0.1 -DsocksProxyPort=8118 -noverify -Xmx500m -cp output.jar Bot %1
pause
[/code]

Leave the ip and port. This will connect to tor as a SOCKS5 Proxy which will route the connection through many, many proxies. It will only work while Tor is running however, so make sure that it is.

Also, since it is using tor as a proxy, it will automatically change proxies internally if any go down. Effectively, you will get a new IP every couple hours. You&#39;ll never need to change proxies again!

I take no responsibility for ANYTHING that happens as a result of this working, unless the event is good, in which case I will happily take responsibility for it =].

[NOTE]

Linux users:

On the download page mentioned at the top of this tutorial, follow the download instructions for your distribution. Then, edit the sh file instead of the bat file, and change all of the semicolons to colons. 

Enjoy!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I think the port is 8118,it could be different,check.
-.--slave proxy format don&#39;t work.
not like ip banning is true anyways,but your all worried about you main pixels...</description>
