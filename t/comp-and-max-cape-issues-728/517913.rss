    <title>Comp and max cape issues (728)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/comp-and-max-cape-issues-728/517913</link>
    <description>So i added this code in my code in my itemconstans.java [code]public static boolean canWear(Item item, Player player) {
        if (player.getRights() == 2)
			return true;
		if (player.getRights() == 7)
			return true;
		if((item.getId() == 20769 || item.getId() == 20771) &amp;&amp; (player.getSkills().getTotalLevel(player) != 1)) {
			player.getPackets().sendGameMessage(&quot;You need to be maxed to wear this.&quot;);
			return false;[/code] Because im using rune evo, it used to be set so the player just had to complete fight keln, it used to look like this [code]public static boolean canWear(Item item, Player player) {
		if (player.getRights() == 2)
			return true;
		if (player.getRights() == 7)
			return true;
		if ((item.getId() == 20769 || item.getId() == 20771)) {
			if (!player.isCompletedFightKiln()) {
				player.getPackets()
						.sendGameMessage(
								&quot;You need to complete the fight kiln minigame at least once to use this cape.&quot;);[/code] But the top code makes it so the player needs 99 in all skills and 120 dung, witch is what i want. however it wont let the player wear it even if there the required level.  even if i add there rank to this part (0 for reg player) [code]if (player.getRights() == 7)
			return true;[/code] it just makes it so the player can wear it without even haveing the level. I want to have it so the player can actuly wear the cape with the requirements, instead the player can have the required stats but they cant wear it. Can some one please help me with this?  thanks :)</description>
