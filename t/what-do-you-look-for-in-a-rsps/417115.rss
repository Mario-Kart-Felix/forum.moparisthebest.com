    <title>What do you look for in a rsps?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-do-you-look-for-in-a-rsps/417115</link>
    <description>First off, I do realize that there is no &quot;rsps question&quot; section I am not in development yet nor am I looking for a team so I felt this was the best place.

Okay guys I am asking this because I plan to start working once more on Final Judgement and I am not worried about perfecting skills, and perfecting combat. I want to know what special features do you look for in a server?

If you remember from my v2 of Final Judgement I had added several items while they aren&#39;t big they are unique. For example, slayer helmet assembly, (or) assembly etc. I am one of these people who enjoy making the &quot;little things&quot; as the little things adds up in my opinion. 

So far I am working on this:

-stability
-general client work(as most are crappy in one way or another lol)
-Will NOT be a hybrid client nor contain loaders of any kind
-474 items :) 

- - - - - -

would love to get some good input on here. -loveandpower</description>

              <p>I would never play a DSPK, Hybrid PvP or any of that other shit. I would never play a PI server with 525, 602, or 634 animations packed into it. I’d only play a PI if it’s heavily modified (stability wise and feature wise) and the client’s cache wasn’t 200MB. I can’t find any other server that has a 16MB cache (unless its mine)… People think that the 602 shit is good. Yeah, it’s wonderful, but not for a PI. I wouldn’t play a Delta either, because they usually have these shitty clients with sprites covered with sprites. Dupes are everywhere in the server. I also don’t play servers that pay for staff, <span class="bbcode-s">usually</span> the staff is <span class="bbcode-b">always</span> corrupt. I also hate servers who braaaag about their shitty VPS and say it’s a VPS with 20GB of RAM with a <a href="http://Speedtest.net" rel="nofollow noopener">Speedtest.net</a> screenshot that looks like this:<br>

Most servers bring dungeoneering, fullscreen, etc. All of that is good but the actual content within those servers are  not up to expected par as most of it is just bought/leeched lol.</p>
