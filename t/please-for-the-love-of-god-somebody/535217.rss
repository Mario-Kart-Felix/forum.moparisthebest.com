    <description>[center][B][U][SIZE=6]EDIT EDIT EDIT:[/SIZE][/U][/B]

[B]NOTICE:[/B] MY SERVER *IS* APPARENTLY ONLINE ON THE MOPARSCAPE SERVER STATUS PAGE, YET PLAYERS CAN&#39;T CONNECT TO MY SERVER WHEN THEY DOWNLOAD MY CLIENT.

*

[b]Let me give you some information...[/b]

My 43594 port is online.

My server is online.

I am able to log into my server.

My server status is &quot;[b]Online[/b]&quot; on the MoparScape Server Status page.

My JAR&#39;ed client I have uploaded for download for my players on my forums won&#39;t let other people play. It keeps telling them, &quot;Error connecting to server.&quot;

Yet I&#39;m online right now, and the server is supposedly online.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ALRIGHT CHUMS! DON&#39;T HELP IF YOU DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT YOU&#39;RE DOING, BECAUSE I DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT I&#39;M DOING ALSO.. SO IF THERE&#39;S TWO OF US THAT DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT WE&#39;RE DOING TRYING TO HELP EACH OTHER OUT WE&#39;RE GOING TO GET......


TO A MAGICAL BIG FAT SUCKY LAND CALLED....

NOWHERE. Mk? KTHX. ANYWAY:



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



[B]Literally, my server is online, and I am able to connect. I have portforwarded correctly, and everything is as it should be. Everything, honestly, is running smoothly. Except for one thing.......... PLAYERS CAN&#39;T GET ONLINE. WHY?!

My server&#39;s name is PloxScape. Mk?

My server IP is ploxscape.no-ip.org. Mk?

My local connection IP would be 127.0.0.1. Mk?

Inside my PloxScape Client folder and PloxScape Server folders, are files that must be connected to one of those two IP addresses listed above. Mk?

I know all of this information.. But, heh, heh, eh.. Here&#39;s the thing: I&#39;VE ****ED IT ALL UP AND DONE GOOF&#39;D.[/B]




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



INSIDE &quot;[B]PloxScape Client[/B]&quot; are files called &quot;[B][I]client.java[/I][/B]&quot; and &quot;[B][I]gui.java[/I][/B]&quot;. Mk?

CODES FROM [B][I]CLIENT.JAVA[/I][/B] (Client sided)

[url=http://privatepaste.com/565af7210d]privatepaste.com :: Paste ID 565af7210d[/url]

-----------------------------------------------------------

CODES FROM [B][I]GUI.JAVA[/I][/B] (Client sided)

http://privatepaste.com/cf07b02e02


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




INSIDE &quot;PloxScape Server&quot; are files called &quot;[B][I]client.java[/I][/B]&quot; and &quot;[B][I]server.java[/I][/B]&quot;. Mk?

CODES FROM [B][I]CLIENT.JAVA[/I][/B] (Server sided)

http://privatepaste.com/download/0bdbf570f4

-----------------------------------------------------------

CODES FROM [B][I]SERVER.JAVA[/I][/B] (Server sided)

http://privatepaste.com/444e4cb20b




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



All ya gotta do now, chums, is tell me which IP addresses from the beginning of this thread goes where and correct the horrible mistake I&#39;ve made, which I apologize for, having to ask you good people who are far more skilled than I for help. :(




Thanks so much for helping me![/center]</description>

<p>I just JAR’ed it again. Made sure it was <a href="http://ploxscape.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">ploxscape.no-ip.org</a> and everything. Still didn’t work. The client I’m using for myself as the owner is set on <a href="http://ploxscape.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">ploxscape.no-ip.org</a>. Am I right?</p>

Why would you change it too 127.0.0.1 if you want other people to connect… Use your no-ip and make sure you portfoward correctly. And btw don’t be an asshole on your server topic help post, we are trying to help you.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I changed it to 127.0.0.1 because that’s what everyone else was telling me to do. What I would like is for someone to actually take a look at my files before they tell me I haven’t port forwarded correctly, or that it’s an issue with my java, or some other BS excuse to try and sound smart or helpful. Literally, on every other forum I’ve posted this on-going-15-hours-in-counting-issue I’m having, everyone is telling me to do things I have already done. I just want to know where to put the correct IP addresses in their correct locations so I can JAR this stupid thing, and upload it for download. And that’s it. But nobody can seem to give me that information.</p>
<p>And yes, I HAVE port-forwarded correctly. I have the latest JDK, and java, and all the specified paths are correct for compiling, and running the server, etc. I’m literally online on my server, and my server is online on the MoparScape Server Status page. But nobody can connect. I just want to know how to fix it.</p>
<p>That is it.[/quote]</p>
<p>Buddy do you what putting 127.0.0.1 does, it just lets you connect you to your server. Man people like you get me angry.</p>

<p>Yes sir, I realize this. But the problem is, like, I’ve connected 127.0.0.1 to the wrong file I believe… Or perhaps I didn’t connect it at all. I’m just confused on which IP goes where… Thank you for attempting to help me though!</p>

<p>I am able to log into my server.</p>
<p>My server status is “<span class="bbcode-b">Online</span>” on the MoparScape Server Status page.</p>
<p>My JAR’ed client I have uploaded for download for my players on my forums won’t let other people play. It keeps telling them, “Error connecting to server.”</p>
<p>Yet I’m online right now, and the server is supposedly online.</p>

<p>ALRIGHT CHUMS! DON’T HELP IF YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU’RE DOING, BECAUSE I DON’T KNOW WHAT I’M DOING ALSO… SO IF THERE’S TWO OF US THAT DON’T KNOW WHAT WE’RE DOING TRYING TO HELP EACH OTHER OUT WE’RE GOING TO GET…</p>

<p>[B]Literally, my server is online, and I am able to connect. I have portforwarded correctly, and everything is as it should be. Everything, honestly, is running smoothly. Except for one thing… PLAYERS CAN’T GET ONLINE. WHY?!</p>

<p>My server IP is <a href="http://ploxscape.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">ploxscape.no-ip.org</a>. Mk?</p>
<p>My local connection IP would be 127.0.0.1. Mk?</p>
<p>Inside my PloxScape Client folder and PloxScape Server folders, are files that must be connected to one of those two IP addresses listed above. Mk?</p>

<p>All ya gotta do now, chums, is tell me which IP addresses from the beginning of this thread goes where and correct the horrible mistake I’ve made, which I apologize for, having to ask you good people who are far more skilled than I for help. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
