    <title>Jar won&#39;t load</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jar-wont-load/506893</link>
    <description>So, I&#39;m trying to make a downloadable client, I have jarmaker. So I jar it and it doesn&#39;t load, but it loads fine when I try to load it from my source and client folders... any help would be nice.

I read that it means that it can&#39;t connect to the server.... I have the ips in Loader.java on localhost.... and both the source and client are connecting to my port and I am portforwarded....

Could use some help.
If you got skype add me, my name is rythegreat96

Thanks</description>
