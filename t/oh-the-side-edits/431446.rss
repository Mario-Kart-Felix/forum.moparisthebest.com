    <description>

Uhh, first of all some people seemed to like making up rules as they went along and not telling anyone else because of this the entire server abides by rules which shouldn&#39;t even be there. So I&#39;d like to review the ENTIRE rules of the server so we can discuss what we need to remove/implement to be an official rule. The rules must be consistent and be globally enforced not just by a few staff members who made them up for themselves. 

Current rules:

[quote=&quot;Davidi2, post:1, topic:383844&quot;][anchor=currentrules][b][size=18pt][u]Current Rules[/u][/size][/b]
[b]Failure to follow these rules on the server may result in punishment.[/b]
The staff reserve the right to interpret these rules any way they see fit. The following rules are more like guidelines. You shouldn&#39;t be looking for loopholes in them, rather, you should just get along with them. We&#39;re looking for users that use common sense. For example, we would prefer a user that knows, just because something isn&#39;t on the rules, that it it isn&#39;t necessarily allowed.

[ol][li]No griefing in the game (destroying or doing things with others work without explicit permission from them)
[b]If someone has griefed you, you can use [i]/hawk tool[/i] and then place the given dirt somewhere where your house was destroyed, and it will tell you who did it. [i]TAKE A SCREEN SHOT AND CREATE A REPORT THREAD[/i][/li]
[li]No impersonation; don&#39;t pretend to be someone else[/li]
[li]No flying or other mods used to gain an unfair advantage (xray etc). Use of these tools will earn an instant temporary ban on the first offense, and permanent on the second.[/li]
[li]Harvesting someone else&#39;s crops is now considered griefing, after the advent of hunger in 1.8.[/li]
[li]Admins can&#39;t and wont spawn items for [i]anyone[/i].[/li]
[li][b]PvP Specific Rules:[/b]
[list type=decimal]
[li]If someone allows you into their home/residence/castle/mine/city etc, peacefully, you may not kill them and they may not kill you until you leave the location and start from there.[/li]
[li]When we conduct organized wars/battles/raids, obviously there will need to be some destruction in order to gain access to the stronghold, kill the defenders, and claim victory.  But the destruction will be limited to the bare minimum required to do this, with no destruction afterwards.  In other words you can tear a hole in my castle wall to gain access to my castle and kill me and my fellow clansman, but don&#39;t destroy anything else afterwards.  Griefing rules apply after the action that is.[/li]
[li]If you kill someone near their bed or spawn area, you cannot kill them again until they have time to get their bearings and escape. This is called &#39;camping&#39; and will result in a ban if done repeatedly.[/li]
[/list]
[/li][/ol][/quote]

Before we venture into specific rules I&#39;d like to talk about the &quot;staff can interpret these rules as they see fit&quot; part. In the past this was used to basically bash each other in a disagreement so I&#39;d like to stress this isn&#39;t what it&#39;s there for and please don&#39;t use it recklessly just to support a point you know won&#39;t work. 

Don&#39;t do stuff like &quot;it says I can interpret this as I see fit, you broke my dirt block, banned&quot;. Just be reasonable with it.

Secondly, I&#39;d like to talk about the level of punishments that are given out and to whom. In the past (specifically Noobs are ftw) moderators have been really really harsh just to make themselves look tough. Please don&#39;t do this. We have a loyal player base where most of them would never break a rule on purpose, people make mistakes so please consider the profile of the person you&#39;re punishing before you do it. 

If it&#39;s a new member who has came here to break rules, ban them, if it&#39;s a loyal member who maybe got angry or made a mistake then please just don&#39;t be as harsh unless you feel it is absolutely required. I want to go more in depth about punishments with a nice table soon to guide newer moderators. 

^Above is all my opinion, feel free to challenge me on anything so we can get it sorted out. 

Now, back to the rule sorting (discussion):

[ol][li]The griefing of diamond, iron, gold blocks isn&#39;t against the rules[/li]
[li]Not being nice in terms of fair PVP is punishable. [/li]
[li]Boating - Filling someones house up with boats...Allowed or not?[/li]
[li]Defining disturbance of the community? And what would constitute a punishment?[/li]
[li]How do we deal with xraying? It&#39;s one thing to suspect, but how do we PROVE it?[/li][/ol]


Those are the main ones I&#39;d like to go through really, but feel free to add your own. I realize I&#39;ve typed quite a lot for one day but it&#39;ll be worth it when we have all the rules sorted out. 

I&#39;d also encourage you read:

The staff does not need a report to ban you for breaking the rules if we find evidence of you breaking them, appropriate actions will be taken.</p>

<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">How to properly make a report</span><br>
To make a report please post a topic in the MoparCraft Infraction Reports section <a href="http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php/board,179.0.html" data-bbcode="true">http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php/board,179.0.html</a><br>
The title of the report should include the offenders in-game name or forum name and which ever rule you believe them to have broken.<br>
Inside your post you need to include links to evidence. A example would be a screen shot of a hawk log. To use the hawk command do “/hawk tool”  in-game without quotations and place the dirt block given to you somewhere where you want to obtain evidence. Any previous changes made to where you placed the block will show up in a log. Now press f2 to take a screenshot, now Minecraft will place a screenshot in your %appdata%.minecraft\screenshots<br>
directory on windows based machines. You can upload the pictures to any picture sharing sites.<br>

<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">Final thoughts</span><br>
The rules will change periodically and it is your responsibility to read them.<br>
All accounts on the Moparcraft server and forums belong to moparisthebest and as such if he personally finds you breaking any rules account deletion may occur.</p>

              <p>I’ll respond to your points based on numbers.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I agree all blocks should be treated the same, as for the restoring, I assume you mean rolling back? If so, weren’t the blocks removed from BB rollbacks to stop duping, or has that changed now?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I honestly can’t be specific enough on this point, it was a “rule” that was made by Davidi2 after he punished someone for taking PVP to far, it’s now a server wide joke about “Davidi2s not being nice rule”.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I think he enforced it if your PVP activities become an annoyance to the residence of the server, for example raiding someone four times a day. Personally I don’t see anything wrong with it…</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>I don’t see an issue with it IF the person who did it is willing to remove what they did, IF the person gets annoyed. If they don’t remove it then it becomes an annoyance and should be punished.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uhhh…Moparisthebest that was really my question to you guys, you just asked it back <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> what would we consider a disturbance of the community? Obviously an event like Matty did would just come under major griefer which is bannable anyway.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Say for example, if a group killed everyone on the server 5 times a day would we allow such a damaging attack? It’s a sketchy topic.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>But Si force, how do we KNOW that they mined 50 diamonds/hour? This is the issue we can’t really prove anything. I’ll look for some plugins soon anyhow…</li>

<p>In my opinion griefing these blocks should be against the rules, as it is with every block in the game at the moment. If somebody wishes to make something pretty, they should do it at their own risk, and obviously if it gets griefed then we step in and restore it. (ps. Is the residential mod still around?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also don’t know what you mean here. Are you talking about pouring lava over somebody or spawn trapping them or the likes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think it should be against the rules. If a friend does it to another friend, then I presume they won’t report it,  however if it is done to annoy somebody, then the line should be drawn there and appropriate action taken. Are you able to see who placed boats?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, on this one I would like to bring up the incidence with Matty. This is a bit of an extreme example, but obviously going around setting people and towns on fire is a disturbance in the community. Although i’m not sure what would be the smallest offence that could be defined as a disturbance. I assume though that you could link this with filling a persons house full of boats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no real way to prove it is there? Obviously if somebody has managed to mine up 50 diamonds in an hour, then you would suspect that they have x-rayed, but I don’t know how you could prove this.</p>

<p>So you base it from what rules they broke? e.g. if they spawn kill it can be a misunderstanding, but if they set the entire server on fire it obviously isn’t as that’s common sense.</p>
<p>You get a message about the rules on login anyway so you could argue it’s their own fault. But I don’t think the own fault idea is a good path to go down if we want to get some server activity…</p>

<li>No, I don’t agree with that at all.  Why shouldn’t it be griefing?  We just don’t roll those back because players in the past have used that to ‘dupe’ items.</li>
<li>Being nice?  Define that, it’s too vague.</li>
<li>Never heard of that, it sounds annoying, like griefing.  But then it also could just be harmless fun.  I think if it doesn’t get out of hand it’s probably alright.  (if you do it to someone once, ok, if you do it 4 times per week to someone, that crosses the line)</li>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Uhh, first of all some people seemed to like making up rules as they went along and not telling anyone else because of this the entire server abides by rules which shouldn’t even be there. So I’d like to review the ENTIRE rules of the server so we can discuss what we need to remove/implement to be an official rule. The rules must be consistent and be globally enforced not just by a few staff members who made them up for themselves.</p>
<p>Current rules:</p>
<p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:1, topic:383844”][anchor=currentrules]<span class="bbcode-b">[size=18pt]<span class="bbcode-u">Current Rules</span>[/size]</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Failure to follow these rules on the server may result in punishment.</span><br>
The staff reserve the right to interpret these rules any way they see fit. The following rules are more like guidelines. You shouldn’t be looking for loopholes in them, rather, you should just get along with them. We’re looking for users that use common sense. For example, we would prefer a user that knows, just because something isn’t on the rules, that it it isn’t necessarily allowed.</p>
<p>[ol][li]No griefing in the game (destroying or doing things with others work without explicit permission from them)<br>
[b]If someone has griefed you, you can use <span class="bbcode-i">/hawk tool</span> and then place the given dirt somewhere where your house was destroyed, and it will tell you who did it. <span class="bbcode-i">TAKE A SCREEN SHOT AND CREATE A REPORT THREAD</span>[/li]<br>
[li]No impersonation; don’t pretend to be someone else[/li]<br>
[li]No flying or other mods used to gain an unfair advantage (xray etc). Use of these tools will earn an instant temporary ban on the first offense, and permanent on the second.[/li]<br>
[li]Harvesting someone else’s crops is now considered griefing, after the advent of hunger in 1.8.[/li]<br>
[li]Admins can’t and wont spawn items for <span class="bbcode-i">anyone</span>.[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-b">PvP Specific Rules:</span><br>
[list type=decimal]<br>
[li]If someone allows you into their home/residence/castle/mine/city etc, peacefully, you may not kill them and they may not kill you until you leave the location and start from there.[/li]<br>
[li]When we conduct organized wars/battles/raids, obviously there will need to be some destruction in order to gain access to the stronghold, kill the defenders, and claim victory.  But the destruction will be limited to the bare minimum required to do this, with no destruction afterwards.  In other words you can tear a hole in my castle wall to gain access to my castle and kill me and my fellow clansman, but don’t destroy anything else afterwards.  Griefing rules apply after the action that is.[/li]<br>
[li]If you kill someone near their bed or spawn area, you cannot kill them again until they have time to get their bearings and escape. This is called ‘camping’ and will result in a ban if done repeatedly.[/li]<br>
[/list]<br>
[/li][/ol][/quote]</p>
<p>Before we venture into specific rules I’d like to talk about the “staff can interpret these rules as they see fit” part. In the past this was used to basically bash each other in a disagreement so I’d like to stress this isn’t what it’s there for and please don’t use it recklessly just to support a point you know won’t work.</p>
<p>Don’t do stuff like “it says I can interpret this as I see fit, you broke my dirt block, banned”. Just be reasonable with it.</p>
<p>Secondly, I’d like to talk about the level of punishments that are given out and to whom. In the past (specifically Noobs are ftw) moderators have been really really harsh just to make themselves look tough. Please don’t do this. We have a loyal player base where most of them would never break a rule on purpose, people make mistakes so please consider the profile of the person you’re punishing before you do it.</p>
<p>If it’s a new member who has came here to break rules, ban them, if it’s a loyal member who maybe got angry or made a mistake then please just don’t be as harsh unless you feel it is absolutely required. I want to go more in depth about punishments with a nice table soon to guide newer moderators.</p>
<p>^Above is all my opinion, feel free to challenge me on anything so we can get it sorted out.</p>
<p>Now, back to the rule sorting (discussion):</p>
<p>[ol][li]The griefing of diamond, iron, gold blocks isn’t against the rules[/li]<br>
[li]Not being nice in terms of fair PVP is punishable. [/li]<br>
[li]Boating - Filling someones house up with boats…Allowed or not?[/li]<br>
[li]Defining disturbance of the community? And what would constitute a punishment?[/li]<br>
[li]How do we deal with xraying? It’s one thing to suspect, but how do we PROVE it?[/li][/ol]</p>
<p>Those are the main ones I’d like to go through really, but feel free to add your own. I realize I’ve typed quite a lot for one day but it’ll be worth it when we have all the rules sorted out.</p>
<p>I’d also encourage you read:</p>
