              <p>OK, so Mopar: what is your reasoning the idea that people engaging in homosexual acts affects society negatively?</p>
<p>Even trying to play devil’s advocate I can’t even think of one. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>Anything involving “it’s not God’s way” or whatever can be considered null, since we are talking about how it affects society as whole, a vast section of which doesn’t believe in a god at all, let alone the Christian God. That would be a valid argument for why YOU wouldn’t screw men even if you had the urge to, but I don’t think it applies here.</p>
<p>So what else is there? “It doesn’t allow reproduction”, well… nor does being single, do we start arranging marriages for people who aren’t reproducing by 30?</p>
<p>How else does it affect society at all? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

<p>Going by your argument.</p>
<p>Gay marriage is wrong <span class="bbcode-i">because it affects society negatively</span>, if people did not agree that it was wrong and did not have an implied agreement about this (majority of people think it’s wrong? back to my point…) society simply could not function as well as it does now because of the ability to marry whomever and whatever you like, receiving all the legal benefits that marriage bestows upon it’s partners.  If you allow gay marriage, why not allow a single man to marry as many woman as he likes, or a woman to do the same, and then allow 15 people to file joint taxes etc etc.</p>
<p>Basically all of our laws, rules, and guidelines of society stem from the beliefs of the people.  And again, judging by votes of the people of this country on the issue, marriage between two people of the same sex is still wrong and not wanted.</p>

It isn’t the government stopping it.  In fact in the few states that do allow gay marriage it is the government that allowed it to happen.  In the states that have banned gay marriage it is a large majority of the PEOPLE who have voted to do so.  Just like anything else that is voted on, you can try to convince other people to vote the way you want them to, you can vote yourself, and if you don’t like the outcome you can deal with it, or leave.<br>

So i take it that this appeal to (a bigoted) popularity is a concession that there is no logically valid argument against gay marriage?[/quote]</p>

<p>You are missing a huge difference.  Being black, jewish, muslim, etc is not a choice, but being gay is.  (before we dredge up this debate again, I define choosing to be gay as choosing to engage in a sexual act with someone of the same sex)</p>
<p>Again, just like we won’t allow a 19 year old to marry an 11 year old in this country, we won’t let people marry others of the same sex.</p>

<p>No.  Are you saying people should be free to, say, marry their cat? (and get all the legal benefits of marriage)  This is the same thing.  The VAST majority of Americans think that a legal marriage should only be between a single man and a single woman, so that is how it should be.<br>

<p>So you are saying that homosexuals are inferior?</p>
<p>Human laws only apply to humans. Of course you shouldn’t be allowed to marry a cat.[/quote]</p>
<p>I didn’t say they were inferior.  But about your statement “Of course you shouldn’t be allowed to marry a cat.”, that is what the majority of America thinks about gay marriage as well.</p>

Let’s publish the quote our entire story is based on:</p>
<p>“This state…may not create or recognize any legal status identical or similar to marriage.”</p>
<p>but instead of publishing the text in it’s entirety, we will snip out something right in the middle and replace it with ‘…’, and then not say what it originally said, potentially hiding the fact that our story could be completely bogus.</p>
<p>Idiot reporters, what is written where they put the ‘…’? :rolleyes:<br>

<p>all i know is that if it’s political and divided up it must be communist!</p>
