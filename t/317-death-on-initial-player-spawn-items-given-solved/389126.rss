    <title>[317] Death on Initial Player Spawn &amp; Items Given [SOLVED]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-death-on-initial-player-spawn-items-given-solved/389126</link>
    <description>Hi,

I am using a TestScape based source (317) in which items are provided to the player when they first spawn. After this happens, the player then dies (I assume because the health is not set correctly). I am trying to find where I can set the health properly so that the player remains alive when they first spawn - I do not know where to put this inside the Client.java file as I would assume that in some places it would restore the player to full health when logging in and out again (which I want to avoid).

I also do not know where the items are given in Client.java. I have searched for the IDs of some of the items given (they are random) in Client.java, ItemHandler.java and Item2.java, Item3.java etc. without finding them or where they are given to the player.

[b]For other&#39;s reference:[/b]

1) To remove death on a new character, find:

[code]PlayerSave loadgame = loadMythgame(playerName, playerPass);

			if (loadgame != null) {[/code]

then find the end of that if (may look similar to):

[code]	// PlayerHandler.messageToAll =
				// playerName+&quot;: has logged in! There is now &quot;+PlayerHandler.getPlayerCount()
				// + &quot; players.&quot;;
			}[/code]

Then add at the end of it:

[code]
else {
	currentHealth = 100;
	NewHP = 100;
	playerLevel[playerHitpoints] = 100;
}[/code]

so it becomes:

[code]
	playerXP = loadgame.playerXP;
	// PlayerHandler.messageToAll =
	// playerName+&quot;: has logged in! There is now &quot;+PlayerHandler.getPlayerCount()
	// + &quot; players.&quot;;
} else {
	currentHealth = 100;
	NewHP = 100;
	playerLevel[playerHitpoints] = 100;
}
[/code]

2) To remove new items been given to the character, replace:

[code]playerEquipment[playerHat] = Item.randomHat();
playerEquipment[playerCape] = Item.randomCape();
playerEquipment[playerAmulet] = Item.randomAmulet();
playerEquipment[playerChest] = Item.randomBody();
playerEquipment[playerShield] = Item.randomShield();
playerEquipment[playerLegs] = Item.randomLegs();
playerEquipment[playerHands] = Item.randomGloves();
playerEquipment[playerFeet] = Item.randomBoots();
playerEquipment[playerRing] = Item.randomRing();
playerEquipment[playerArrows] = Item.randomArrows();
playerEquipment[playerWeapon] = 1275;[/code]

with

[code]playerEquipment[playerHat] = -1;
		playerEquipment[playerCape] = -1;
		playerEquipment[playerAmulet] = -1;
		playerEquipment[playerChest] = -1;
		playerEquipment[playerShield] = -1;
		playerEquipment[playerLegs] = -1;
		playerEquipment[playerHands] = -1;
		playerEquipment[playerFeet] = -1;
		playerEquipment[playerRing] = -1;
		playerEquipment[playerArrows] = -1;
		playerEquipment[playerWeapon] = -1;[/code]

In Player.java

[b]EDIT:[/b] Made it clear I was referring to the Client.java, not the client.</description>
