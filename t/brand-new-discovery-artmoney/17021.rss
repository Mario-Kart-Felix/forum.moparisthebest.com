    <title>BRAND NEW DISCOVERY artmoney</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/brand-new-discovery-artmoney/17021</link>
    <description>THIS IS NOT A SCAM, (there is no possible way to scam you by doing this, anyway) yes, i&#39;m new, but ive been around the cheating communities for some time now.  I dont post much, i just sponge up information.  I came accross &quot;Artmoney&quot; a couple times on some forums, and heard &quot;bla bla bla.&quot;  &quot;artmoney is client side only.&quot;  &quot;You can&#39;t keep the 10Million coins you make.&quot;  Well, the coin thing is true, as far as i know.

but i made a groundbreaking discovery.

i&#39;m not completely sure how i did this but...

I arrived in Varrok, and you know how when you bank after using artmoney (just opening the bank itself) makes the item go back to its original value?  Well...

A steel longsword appeared in my inventory.  Able to be banked, traded, equipped.

Breakthrough?  I think so.  I NEED a mod&#39;s help or someone that is good with programming, i WILL NOT post any more information here because i dont want this getting out.   If no one helps me, I will continue on for months trying to exploit my discovery, and eventually will be f*cking rich.  Go ahead, try to find out how alone, theres trillions of combinations in artmoney.  Good luck.

If anyone finds out a way to exploit my findings, there is no way to prove i will get this knowledge.  therefore i have to be extremely careful with who i tell this information to.  i need YOUR word that we will work together on this, finally break runescape, and keep it within a small group so as not to ruin the RS economy altogether.

Imagine spawning 10&#39;s of P Hat sets...just imagine....THERE MUST BE A WAY

<p>Well, there musn’t be.<br>
It’s <span class="bbcode-b">possible</span> that Jagex has left possible exploits in the code, but it isn’t <span class="bbcode-b">necessary</span> that they are abusable with artmoney. There are surely bugs but they may not be useful. If you think you have something you can always PM me; I don’t really care about Runescape wealth or fame among the community, and I will do my best to see if you have anything interesting on your hands.</p>

              <p>if he did actualy spawn a steel longsword it is a breakthrough, compared to the noobs saying “giv me your puser and pass and bank pin and credit card number and transaction id`s so i can hack you up infinity bilion goins!!\11\11\11”</p>
<p>but its probably just accedentaly took one out of your bank. or artmoney accidently got in the way of the packets encripted shitty stuf…<br>
anyway sweet if you did actualy do it. 1 mo i can change the amount in the trade screen, look at the chat box though lol.</p>
