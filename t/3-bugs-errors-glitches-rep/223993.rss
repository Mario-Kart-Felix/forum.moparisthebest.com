    <description>ok first, arrows dont pile on floor when u shoot em, need a fix for that

2nd is scamming, major prob in my serv....

when u put something in trade, in the 2nd trade, they remove the money without it updating
i need it so when u chnage something in the 2nd offer, it declines the trade :o
possible like if (tradestage = 2) { modified = true; declined = true; break;
not a clue but thats a guess :o

3rd, another scamming problem... when u in trade and some1 closes there client or lags/crashes/logs out
both ppl lose there stuff, how culd i possibly make it so it declines the trade first?
