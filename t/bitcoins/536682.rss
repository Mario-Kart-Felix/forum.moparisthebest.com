    <title>Bitcoins</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bitcoins/536682</link>
    <description>So apparently bitcoins are actually becoming a big deal. The bank of the US said they are thinking they will become the major currency for online transactions. Now my question is, how are buffoons secure? Can someone not just create bitcoins or do they use some type of encryption/hash for each bitcoin to ensure it is an actual bitcoin and who performs these hashes? I know very little about encryption but I feel like if someone was smart enough they could create their own bitcoins. Obviously this isn&#39;t the case if the bank of the US is thinking of adopting them, but I feel someone is making bank either way. Someone is generating these bitcoins and getting mass cash haha. Also there&#39;s massive amounts of money to be made flipping this currency. In a single day I&#39;ve seen the price go from 1000-870-1230 all in oncle day haha. Flip two bitcoins a day and you are set for life.</description>

Not a huge amount but nothing to sneeze at. There were claims on reddit of people losing over 1000BTC, which is foolish considering mtgox’s history, but I still sympathize with them</p>

<p>Yeah… you’re wrong, unfortunately. I had £300 of my own money and asked my parents to put in around £200 of their own each, which we could have then bought Bitcoins together and profited off it as a family. It wasn’t a passing thought one day as I looked out the bus window, I physically put money towards it but I was too young to wiretransfer it in order to buy Bitcoins, and my parents wouldn’t do it as they thought I’d lose a lot of money.</p>

I fudgeing hate bitcoins. I wanted to invest into them, (I frequently invest) and my dad wouldn’t trust an internet currency, then they went from 50$ each, to 200$ each, now they were just at $1000.00 each. Fuck me…<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>When they were $0.50 each, I begged my parents to put $1000.00 down into Bitcoins. They told me that I didn’t know what I was talking about. Seeing them hit $1000.00 each was saddening to say the least.[/quote]</p>

<p>I fudgeing hate bitcoins. I wanted to invest into them, (I frequently invest) and my dad wouldn’t trust an internet currency, then they went from 50$ each, to 200$ each, now they were just at $1000.00 each. Fuck me…</p>

<p>When they were $0.50 each, I begged my parents to put $1000.00 down into Bitcoins. They told me that I didn’t know what I was talking about. Seeing them hit $1000.00 each was saddening to say the least.</p>

              <p>I saw a Princeton economist write about bitcoins saying the only use they have is for drug cartels and weapon dealers. Which is my thoughts. Apparently people like the transparency of the transactions even if they are not dealing in illegal activities though. That’s the only logical explanation I can come up with for why people would adopt these.</p>
