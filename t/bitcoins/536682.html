        <p>So apparently bitcoins are actually becoming a big deal. The bank of the US said they are thinking they will become the major currency for online transactions. Now my question is, how are buffoons secure? Can someone not just create bitcoins or do they use some type of encryption/hash for each bitcoin to ensure it is an actual bitcoin and who performs these hashes? I know very little about encryption but I feel like if someone was smart enough they could create their own bitcoins. Obviously this isn’t the case if the bank of the US is thinking of adopting them, but I feel someone is making bank either way. Someone is generating these bitcoins and getting mass cash haha. Also there’s massive amounts of money to be made flipping this currency. In a single day I’ve seen the price go from 1000-870-1230 all in oncle day haha. Flip two bitcoins a day and you are set for life.</p>

Ok course flipping currencies is risky but people do it with more popular currencies such as euros. It would be even more risky with how volatile the price of bitcoins are. Sorry meant bank of America, I read it in USA today so perhaps that is why I had us in my head haha. Should of looked at the article again.</p>
<p>So am I correct that I could mine these bitcoins and get 800$ for every bitcoin or so I mine? What I got from the Wikipedia article is people try and brute force a cryptographic problem to get a bitcoin and then you have the key for a bitcoin and it is erased from this guys server so that nobody else can get that bitcoin? Obviously my pc wouldn’t stack up with the hardware people are using to mine these bitcoins, but just wondering how this is working.</p>

        <p>Bitcoins become harder and harder to mine, the more that are generated. It’s so difficult now that people are using FPGAs and ASICs for both power efficiency and performance. I don’t know how the crypto stuff works, but I think it’d be pretty reasonable to assume it’s as secure as a decent implementation of RSA? I’m sure plenty of smart people have tried breaking it… bitcoin has been around for a while now.</p>
<p>Also it’s worth keeping in mind that bitcoins were designed for exchange and buying shit online, and using bitcoin as a new currency is a terrible terrible idea. The bitcoin supply just inflates forever, and there’s also no way to control it if we ever wanted to address growth problems. What happens when inflation drops below 2%? OOPS DEFLATIONARY SHOCK</p>

<p>Sure. But even then it would take you a very long time to accumulate 1 bitcoin.</p>
<p>Assuming I use only my CPU (i5-3570k) to mine, I would make $0.01 USD per day.<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Axc0H2H.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
As they get more difficult to mine, that rate goes down. Factor in electricity costs, maintenance, etc. and it is increasingly impossible for the average person to mine for the purpose of “getting rich quick.”</p>

        <p>[quote=“The Wanderer, post:6, topic:536682”]I thought the bitcoin supply will stop at 21 million bitcoins?[/quote]Yeah, mining gets harder and harder meaning that the supply will continue inflating but the actual rate of inflation will keep dropping closer and closer to 0%. I didn’t know it actually stopped at 21m, but that’s effectively just 0% inflation. Which is very bad for an economy/currency!</p>

The first is that the government can’t control it to respond to growth (although this might be a good thing if your government is corrupt). In the short run you get the problem bitcoin is facing right now - massive volatility. It’s also pretty widely accepted that inflation should be kept above 2%… any less and you run the risk of deflation which can cause a deflationary spiral. None of these are really massive issues for bitcoin if used how it was expected to be used, but some people are taking this shit way too seriously and it’s not going to impact their lives any less just because it’s a virtual currency.</p>
<p>edit: forgot to answer your original question -no, bitcoin isn’t backed by any existing currency. it’s really just a completely separate currency, with the same problems as any other new currency. the main difference is that inflation CANNOT be controlled.</p>

        <p>Go get a degree in economics and put whatever money you have into an actual investment before you question me. It’s one thing to talk about it and criticize, but it’s another to take your actual life savings and put it on the line. I’ll assume (by your post and age) that you haven’t invested a penny.</p>
<blockquote>You should really tie that in with the rest of your post. Are you saying that letting the government control the money supply is a bad thing? Therefore bitcoin is good because nobody can control the supply?</blockquote>
The government controls inflation. If money needs to be printed, it will be printed. If it needs to be taken out of circulation, it will be taken out. There needs to be some sort of organization behind a currency, we need someone to blame if the shit goes worthless. Bitcoin is horrible (just like our current situation) because it's not backed by anything.

Again, it's not backed by anything. The shit is make believe. Where did I ever say you can't spend it? Since when has the US dollar been stable?

<p>Bold does not imply that bitcoin has ‘always been’ in a bubble. Supply is not an issue, it’s demand. Bitcoin has no demand in the ‘real world’. You should also learn what a bubble is.</p>
<p>Gold is brought up in the discussion because gold is the international currency, recognized everywhere and displays wealth and power and if you were a real investor like I pointed out, you would watch the price of gold very closely. Especially the upcoming months.</p>
<p>Here is an idea though, go on ebay or some other website and sell shit for bitcoins. Take the bitcoins and don’t give them their items. Law enforcement won’t do shit. You’re gonna be sued for a currency that the U.S doesn’t give two shits about?</p>

        <p>[quote=“Rodgerwilco, post:14, topic:536682”]Go get a degree in economics and put whatever money you have into an actual investment before you question me. It’s one thing to talk about it and criticize, but it’s another to take your actual life savings and put it on the line. I’ll assume (by your post and age) that you haven’t invested a penny.</p>
<p>[quote]You should really tie that in with the rest of your post. Are you saying that letting the government control the money supply is a bad thing? Therefore bitcoin is good because nobody can control the supply?<br>
[/quote]<br>
The government controls inflation. If money needs to be printed, it will be printed. If it needs to be taken out of circulation, it will be taken out. There needs to be some sort of organization behind a currency, we need someone to blame if the shit goes worthless. Bitcoin is horrible (just like our current situation) because it’s not backed by anything.</p>
<p>[quote]</p>

<p>Bitcoin has a real problem. It’s not backed by anything and at the current moment you can hardly spent it. The reason is was popular is because it is a great way to keep money untraceable. So if you want to make an illegal trade with someone, you can freely do it with “bitcoins”.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This isn’t the reason you can’t spend it. Not backing against a real currency doesn’t make your new currency worthless, it just means you can’t rely on the stability of something like the US dollar.[/quote]<br>
Again, it’s not backed by anything. The shit is make believe. Where did I ever say you can’t spend it? Since when has the US dollar been stable?</p>

</aside>
<p>Are you saying that bitcoin has always been in a bubble? Can you actually justify that? I fail to see how this is any different from any other currency. All of our money is intrinsically worthless. It only has value because people trust the supply. Bitcoin might have the disinflation problems, but it still has a secure supply and people trust that.[/quote]</p>
<p>Bold does not imply that bitcoin has ‘always been’ in a bubble. Supply is not an issue, it’s demand. Bitcoin has no demand in the ‘real world’. You should also learn what a bubble is.</p>
<p>Gold is brought up in the discussion because gold is the international currency, recognized everywhere and displays wealth and power and if you were a real investor like I pointed out, you would watch the price of gold very closely. Especially the upcoming months.</p>
<p>Here is an idea though, go on ebay or some other website and sell shit for bitcoins. Take the bitcoins and don’t give them their items. Law enforcement won’t do shit. You’re gonna be sued for a currency that the U.S doesn’t give two shits about?[/quote]<br>
See most of that post was my original thinking. How could a bitcoin ever be worth 800$? The only idea I had was hype. However I’ve been seeing tons of articles (albeit from the news which creates hype) about bitcoins. Such as the bank of America thinking of the bitcoin becoming a major currency and governments setting up bitcoin atms. Surely entire governments and banking agencies cannot be fooled into thinking bitcoins are a good idea, right? What makes them justify these actions in adopting the bitcoin as an actual currency?<br>
