    <description>Exhibit A
&lt;blockquote&gt;Hi All,

I checked with Norton Anti-Virus, and they are gearing up for this virus!
I checked Snopes , and it is for real!! Get this E-mail message sent around to your contacts ASAP.
PLEASE FORWARD THIS WARNING AMONG FRIENDS, FAMILY AND CONTACTS!
 You should be alert during the next few days. Do not open any message  with an attachment entitled 

&#39;POSTCARD FROM HALLMARK,&#39; regardless of who sent it to you. 

It is a virus which opens A POSTCARD IMAGE, which &#39;burns&#39; the whole hard disc C of your computer. This virus will be received from  someone who has your e-mail address in his/her contact list. 
This is the reason why you need to send this e-mail to all your contacts It is better to receive this message 25 times than to receive the virus and open it.
If you receive a mail called&#39; POSTCARD,&#39; even though sent to you by a
Friend, do not open it! 
Shut down your computer immediately.
This is the worst virus announced by CNN. It has been classified by
Microsoft as the most destructive virus ever. This virus was discovered by McAfee yesterday, and there is no repair yet for this kind of virus.  
This virus simply destroys the Zero Sector of the Hard Disc, where the vital information is kept.
COPY THIS E-MAIL, AND SEND IT TO YOUR FRIENDS. 
REMEMBER: IF YOU SEND IT TO THEM, YOU WILL BENEFIT ALL OF US&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Exhibit B
&lt;blockquote&gt;&gt; &gt;THIS IS VERY SERIOUS, PLEASE SENDTO EVERYONE ON YOUR E-MAIL LIST!! 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Anyone-using Internet mail such as Yahoo, Hotmail,
&gt; &gt;AOL and so on.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This information arrived this morning,
&gt; &gt;Direct from both Microsoft and Norton
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Please send it to everybody you know who has
&gt; &gt;access to the Internet.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;You may
&gt; &gt;receive an apparently harmless e-mail titled   &#39;Mail Server Report&#39;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;If you open either file, a message will appear on your screen saying:
&gt; &gt;&#39;It is too late now, your life is no longer beautiful.&#39;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Subsequently you will LOSE EVERYTHING IN YOUR PC,
&gt; &gt;And the person who sent it to you will gain access to your
&gt; &gt;name, e-mail and password.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This is a new virus which started to circulate on Saturday afternoon.
&gt; &gt;AOLhas  already confirmed the severity, and the anti virus software&#39;s are 
&gt; &gt;not capable of destroying it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The virus has been created by a hacker who calls himself
&gt; &gt;&#39;life owner&#39;.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;PLEASE SEND A COPY OF THIS E-MAIL
&gt; &gt;TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS, And ask them to
&gt; &gt;PASS IT ON IMMEDIATELY!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;THIS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY SNOPES.
&gt; &gt;

I think we are stupid because we don&#39;t have maps of south africa etc.
