What is Corrupt Combat?

Corrupt Combat is a Project Insanity based 317 PK Server. Our main goal is to offer a great Player vs Player experience, ignoring everything else. We have two versions of the server, one is a PVP World, the other is wilderness only PVP. I wont waste my time listing how we have curses etc as these were all in the base. We are using Vistex V7 as a base as I feel this is currently the best PK source available. We will have unspawnable items such as nex armour, korasis etc. I personally would remove all of these new items and stick with the oldschool weapons, but the PK community wouldn&#39;t like that.

Our goals

Perfect Combat
Perfect Switching
Log on and PK
All weapons the community want
Easy access to PvP
Large Playerbase

I&#39;m a big fan of RunescapeWebclients, or RSW and this project will start of there. I hosted it as a BETA testing version, and within five days we had over 300 character files and were in the top 5.

All other decisions such as the version we use, PvP or Wilderness will all be decided later on.

<p>It’s your RuneScape Private Server. You can remove whatever you see fit. I’m sure a lot of people would love an old school PvP oriented Server.</p>

<p>Your Player Base sounds like a lie, because the numbers don’t add up. Good luck nonetheless.</p>
