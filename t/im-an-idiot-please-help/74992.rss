    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-an-idiot-please-help/74992</link>
    <description>Ok i have been so pissed off lately becuase all i want to do is to get two scripts working, willow whacker, and a yew chopping script. right now my noob account is only lvl 30 wcing so im trying to get the willow whacker from lorax and similion. I was told that i have to download the script, move the cross hairs on the client, and pick the colors in the forum, and start the script. the only problems are i dont see where the forum is in the script, but i do see where it says color or somethnig liek that then = &#39;bank&#39; and i understand to put the color of the bank sign in there but, later on in the script it says &#39;bank&#39; liek 20 times so do i have to copy and paste each time where it says bank everytime i want to run the script!? and whenever i start the script it says failed when compiling. i really dont know how to set the script up. and today i heard something about a srl? do i need an srl for randoms? why is this so confusing! i just want to run a script please help!.please please please help! the only reason i want to run script is because i got tricked and died with full guthans and lsot spear so i wana make my cash back. if someone cheats me, i cheat the game =)</description>

              <p>[ul]okay, i will but first do i need toextract files from slr/winword to get scar to use my script?and if so can u post a really easy guide to be able to do that, this is the script,</p>
<p>I tried to put the script there but  i can only use 20000 so how do i make a scroller on the side? liek what button do i push after highlighting it?once you tell me ill just delet this and replace it with the script</p>
<p>ok this is the script mad by lorax and similion called willow whacker, im not sure if it’s the best willow cutter if you know a better one please give me it i want the best one. first of all im brand new to fillnig scripts in, do i only have to fill in the pink? or only certain parts of the pink? Or is there a forum that i fill in the colors, if so how do i get that forum to pop up? where does it ask for the trees color? and you know how they say if you logg in and out you wont get as many randoms? well all the ppl i have added that auto logg in and out asgain every 5-10mins and they never have to reset colors? but i thought runescape changed the colors everytime you logged in and out just a little bit, not noticable, so how are they doing that?[/ul]</p>

<p>Seriously, take it <em>easy</em>, don’t expect every thting to be served to you on a silver platter like I did, you need to lean how to script in most cases, bit this is the best option.</p>
<p>I appreciate that you might not be able to learn how to script in SCAR, or simply don’t want to but I really think you should.</p>
