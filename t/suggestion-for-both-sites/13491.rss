    <title>Suggestion for both sites</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/suggestion-for-both-sites/13491</link>
    <description>I think there are TOO many posts of the same thing. Perhaps make different areas and a crew where the people in that group keep active and look at the FAQs, and keep good threads clean and alive (besides mods deleting, I mean like keeping things up-to-date)

and than people that didn&#39;t read and posted it all over again received instant bans..?</description>

              <p>Erm, sorry for making you pissed off by your bad wording?</p>
<p>Honestly, there is nothing we can do about the private servers area. The best admins and mods can do is to try and keep it down. It will never go as not everyone will read the rules of them forum before posting. All they are interested in is getting a quick answer and not ever coming back. Therefore, they disregard the rules.</p>
<p>I am still with what I first said and I still agree that people who double post shouldn’t get banned.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Mr.Chris, post:2, topic:13491”]Keeping threads ‘bumped’ all the time is a very bad idea. Think about the amount of threads battling eachother for the top. That’s why we have the rules AGAINST grave digging and bumping up topics.</p>
<p>Also, I havent seen many threads repeat themselves, apart from maybe the odd Google Video. I don’t believe this is a massive problem of which the forum is suffering from.</p>
<p>I think the thing about recieving ‘Instant Bans’ is totally wrong. No one should be banned for double posting. Maybe just ‘Please don’t double post :)’ would be a good response to something as petit as that.</p>
<p>Sorry to say, but I personally do not agree with what you are saying.[/quote]</p>
<p>I never said keeping them “bumped” “all the time”, and I mean making double threads! you don;t know how pissed off I am after reading your reply, you didn’t understand properly. I mean literally.</p>
<p>Seriously, It’s not as bad here but private servers area becomes like shit… finally PWNED is starting do do a clean up in advertisement, but that’s not enough.</p>

<p>Yeah, people shouldn’t be instant banned for doing something like double posting; it’s just not big enough. Don’t get me wrong, it IS bad, and should be stopped, but banning isn’t the fair way.</p>
