To lazy to post anything else if you want more information on the server tell me what to put in this thread or if it needs more Picture&#39;s/Media. Thank you for reading this post comment if you like. Comment if you don&#39;t like I don&#39;t care at the moment.

[size=14pt][u][b]Details:[/b][/u][/size]
[size=10pt]I started this server back when I first started to learn about MoparScape it is very helpful sometimes... I&#39;ve got this as a Blank Clean Delta server and just started adding as much as I could I redid all the Item ID&#39;s so the model&#39;s read a little cleaner because the Item ID&#39;s aren&#39;t clashing together and so I got some Gnome cloth&#39;s back and it seems that it made the server run a bit smoother. I would love to hear people&#39;s thoughts, comments and constructive criticism on this. If you have anymore ideas on how to make it less like Delta then please comment.[/size]

[size=14pt][u][b]Minigames:[/b][/u][/size]
[size=10pt]Barrows (Only npc&#39;s trying to make it as real as RuneScape&#39;s.)
Assault (Not the same old delta Assault I tried to make my own warriors guild and it looks pretty good.)
Fight Pit&#39;s (Same old fight pits but I&#39;m adding some interface texts with them so it&#39;s more like RuneScape&#39;s.)
Pest Control (Same old PC from any other Delta but I made the check a starter of a quest.)
Castle Wars (Need&#39;s a lot of work it&#39;s really glitchy but it&#39;s just a basic model that I want to build from and try to make better.)
Clan Wars (I had some help making this it still has some glitches that need to be fixed but other then that its amazing!)
God Wars (Same Delta God Wars I added 3 God&#39;s all there animations are perfect and attacks are just right.  :P)
Bio-Pets (I made up this minigame I used some god war&#39;s mini bosses.)
Fun-Pk (Great for people who don&#39;t know how to pk and I&#39;m making a FunPk in the skilling area.)[/size]

[size=14pt][u][b]Features:[/b][/u][/size]
[size=10pt]100% Webclient Made by: Michael Geant
75% 474 Looking weapons and specails (Still need to find GFX&#39;s and Animations for PVP weapons.)
474 Running models (Changes when you wear Whip/Claws/Dragon.)
God mode (You just float in the air and it reminded me of 12-sky2 so I added it for donater&#39;s it also works while fighting.)
100% Show Equipment Screen
100% Item Kept on Death Screen
Change all Model ID&#39;s so Model&#39;s read a little cleaner
I&#39;ve finished redoing all the Item.cfg Id&#39;s so now the models are much cleaner and all the item&#39;s are usable.
All skills are trainable but I need to improve skilling.
100% GFX/Animations for Barrelchest/Bandos God/Armadyl God/Zammy God.(I know that not there proper name&#39;s but who give&#39;s a shit...)
Really sick home area I&#39;ve never seen it on any other server.
[color=red]More features will be posted as we update the server.[/size]

[size=14pt][u][b]What I want to work on:[/b][/u][/size]
[size=10pt]Fixing how you skill and making them more like RuneScape&#39;s
Making a better Clan Chat system
Making a Clan Chat Interface
Skillcape Emote with 474 models
Making more bosses with right GFX&#39;s and Animations
Fixing up Castle Wars might change it into Battle Grounds[/size]

<p>I learned that if you do space’s why your trying to make a point that people don’t bitch to much about it so I’m good with the post so far.</p>

              <p>[quote=“razami, post:80, topic:385420”]Thanks for all the advise that are I really wanted. I just put the flamer part because I was hoping some people would understand that I really am trying my hardest to learn about Java. The people who have posted helpful comment’s I thank you for the help and I will take your advise and keep messing around with Java so I can learn more. I will take out the part of the title so that it won’t be flamer bait. I’m sorry that some of you can’t understand what I post I’m just trying to post the way I seen other people to post. I’m trying my best to use proper English and if I am typing things wrong please tell me what more to fix but try to post about the server now because I have posted some picture’s… So look at them read my post and try to tell me what to fix on it. Tell me how to get better knowledge on learning Java. All I ask for is a little help.</p>
<p>Thank you for the useful post.<br>
I’m sorry for over reacting on the flamer’s post and I’ll try to use your post to help learn on what to change I guess because every post is helpful I guess but I do want a mod to look over this post to see if anyone was flaming for dumb reasons or whatever…</p>
<p>I hope I typed this post a little bit more clearer if I didn’t sorry for that and tell me how I should post.[/quote]<br>
Although you may still be judged by your previous posts, it’s nice to see someone apologise like that. Remember to take a little, you must give a little.</p>

              <p>Thanks for all the advise that are I really wanted. I just put the flamer part because I was hoping some people would understand that I really am trying my hardest to learn about Java. The people who have posted helpful comment’s I thank you for the help and I will take your advise and keep messing around with Java so I can learn more. I will take out the part of the title so that it won’t be flamer bait. I’m sorry that some of you can’t understand what I post I’m just trying to post the way I seen other people to post. I’m trying my best to use proper English and if I am typing things wrong please tell me what more to fix but try to post about the server now because I have posted some picture’s… So look at them read my post and try to tell me what to fix on it. Tell me how to get better knowledge on learning Java. All I ask for is a little help.</p>
<p>Thank you for the useful post.<br>
I’m sorry for over reacting on the flamer’s post and I’ll try to use your post to help learn on what to change I guess because every post is helpful I guess but I do want a mod to look over this post to see if anyone was flaming for dumb reasons or whatever…</p>
<p>I hope I typed this post a little bit more clearer if I didn’t sorry for that and tell me how I should post.</p>

<p>This is a serious post, and if u think I’m flaming, then just leave now.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t say cyber here. People won’t like you.</li>
<li>Asking for people not to flame you is the NUMBER ONE way to get flamed</li>
<li>Learn your languages, you seem even dumber when you say JavaC+. C, C# and C++ are all languages that are often used in association with Java, but are not Java, nor do the companies have any sort of affiliation</li>
<li>Please use commas, periods, breaks ect. It makes it so much easier to read, currently your words are way to jumbled together.</li>
<li>Mess around with Java more before you post here, and I recommend if you actually are interested in Java, you should also try some tutorials in other places, as I don’t recommend Moparscape for these kinds of things… generally the learning part.</li>
<li>The report to moderator button is helpful, just press it on posts you don’t like and let a moderator evaluate it to see if that users post should be removed along with some form of warning. I use it all the time.</li>
<li>Don’t be so sarcastic all the time</li>
</ol>
<p>If you follow this stuff, people won’t troll your work as hard.<br>
Goodluck with whatever your doing, and please change the title of the thread, prefereably taking out the first part. You can do so by double clicking on the topic box that you’ve created on the thread page.</p>

You call everyone an asshole and then ask for no flame. You should not flame-bait then. Plus the title is just asking for trouble as people are going to do the exact opposite to what you say. I am trying to help you out here.
<p>Good luck.</p>

Ok, before you ever post again, realize this.</p>
<p>Java, C, and C++ Are all different languages; also, RSPS is programmed in Java, therefore you don’t need to know C or C++.</p>
<p>C+ also Isn’t a language.</p>

<p>What is JavaC++? Just use the report to moderator button in the future, or private message a member of staff and ask them to clean the thread of any rants.</p>
