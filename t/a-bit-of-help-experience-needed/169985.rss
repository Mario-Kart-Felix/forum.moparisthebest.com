    <title>A Bit Of Help, Experience Needed</title>

    <description>Ok Hey Guys!  :) 

I&#39;ve Been Working On A Devolution Server Source 7.0 For A Month And A BitIm Just Making The Finishing Touches. And I Was Wondering 2 Simple Things That Have Never Occured To Me Until Now. Although I Don&#39;t Really Need To Know There Things For What I&#39;m Doing It Would Really Help If Ever Needed Later On.

1) How Do I Add Objects?

2) How Do I Give Item When Reach Level 99 In A Skill?

Since I Have No Experience In These Subjects Step By Step Instructions Will Be Needed As Of What To Search And Where To Add  

In Addition I Was Also Wondering About A Reasonably Compilcated Subject. 

3) Making Potions Work

Im More Worried About Questions One And Two But This Would Really Help. To Avoid Too Much Trouble I&#39;ve Decided To Just Make It Give Permanent Xp For A Skill. This Is What I Have So Far:

case 2428:
addSkillXP(800, 17); removeitem code (i dont know it...)
Break;

All Help Would Be Appreciated On These Topics But Don&#39;t Answer If Your Too Busy 

Thanx Guys.

Ps. Please Avoid Posting Useless Comments That Won&#39;t Help Me At All.  :D</description>
