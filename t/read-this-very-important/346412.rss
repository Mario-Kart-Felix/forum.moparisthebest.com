this guy&#39;s smart as hell, unless you have avg , or norton 360 you wont detect it.. i promise you, its disguised as a server, its going to work perfectly for you. youll never notice whats going on, it allows him to view your desktop, see your ip, check your internet browser history, basiclly fuck your life. this is a warning to young users are anyone who wants to keep their computer and them safe, his real name is tom AKA Canownyoueasy, if you think im lieing download it, but id advice you dont..

what his program is and does... Its called a R.A.T (Remote Adminstration Tool ) it allows him to view your files and your programs..
anything on your computer he can see.
credential information.. anything he wants, you see when you download this and run it, it locates your ip, sends it to his desktop.. he then can get into your ip.. go to your desktop and even if you have remote control (allows users to control your computer from their desktop most computer techs use it ) even if its turned off.. it still works. He has it very hidden, you wouldnt notice it at all unless your know your coding dam well ) only the best antivirus&#39;s can detect it ill give you a list of the antivirus&#39;s that can detect it within an hour or to five minutes..

Norton 360
Norton Antivirus
Avg&#39;s
Avg pro
Thiers more..

Please if you dont believe me download it, im not trying to scare you all into not downloading it, i dont know him. heres a quote of two people like me whos antivirus&#39;s detected it...

&lt; I spy arr0w &gt;

Guys.. No one noticed this yet?..
This is a RAT (Remote Administration Tool), It binds you to his *HackingProgram* server and allows him to access your file. He has it very hidden so only the best of the best anti-viruses can detect it.

I used to be friends with him, he has over 30 people on his program which he can view their desktop, and even their webcam. It&#39;s pretty sad. His name is Tom aka Canownueasy
(To bad he sucks at pking and i beat him like 30 times in his server LOL)
I watched him give out this download to little kids so he can get their accounts.

Also...
