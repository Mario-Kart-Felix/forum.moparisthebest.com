    <title>New rules</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-rules/391356</link>
    <description>We need to spell out rules more clearly, so since you guys play on the server, you get to help in the forming of the rules.  First a quick guideline, I will not make completely unenforceable rules, like no client mods, or you must wear pants while playing MoparCraft.

So here is what I came up with from the current rules:

[ol][li]No griefing in the game (destroying or doing things with others work without explicit permission from them)
[/li][li]No impersonation; don&#39;t pretend to be someone else[/li]
[li]No flying.[/li]
[li]No one, not even admins, can spawn items or teleport.  Don&#39;t ask.[/li]
[li][b]PvP Specific Rules:[/b]
[list type=decimal]
[li]If someone allows you into their home/residence/castle/mine/city etc, peacefully, you may not kill them and they may not kill you until you leave the location and start from there.[/li]
[li]When we conduct organized wars/battles/raids, obviously there will need to be some destruction in order to gain access to the stronghold, kill the defenders, and claim victory.  But the destruction will be limited to the bare minimum required to do this, with no destruction afterwards.  In other words you can tear a hole in my castle wall to gain access to my castle and kill me and my fellow clansman, but don&#39;t destroy anything else afterwards.  Griefing rules apply after the action that is.[/li]
[li]No PvP in the protected spawn area.[/li]
[li]No &#39;spawn camping&#39; at beds where people spawn.[/li]
[/list]
[/li][/ol]


I think most of those are agreed upon, but there has been a lot of debate about &#39;stealing&#39; from chests.  Should this be against the rules?  If so, how could we possibly enforce it?  Big Brother only lets you see who accessed the chest, not who took from it.

Let the debate begin!</description>

I’d like to try to spell out the distinction though.  Opening a door and looting an unhidden chest should be allowed, ripping up an entire floor to a building to find a chest, not so much.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I wouldn’t go as far as ripping up an entire floor, I agree on that part. But as far as checking areas you think may contain a chest, checking them, replacing the objects you removed if you failed to find anything.</p>
<p>I think ripping up large segments of someones property should defiantly count as griefing. Is the ‘10 blocks space’ rule still in action? Where if someone builds within 10 blocks of you, you get action to destroy the property if they refuse to move.[/quote]</p>
<p>And to add to this, all blocks should be replaced when possible to create a minimal damage affect. In most cases you can easily walk through the door and find a chest based on markers the person has set his/her self.</p>
<p>The only potential issue I could see is people disguising ‘chest hunting’ for griefing which is where your point about setting a clear distinction should come in. I think some key ideals of this distinction could range from a limit on amount of blocks to break or it could be down to the moderators distinction when they view the evidence.</p>
<p>I think a firm set limit to distinguish between the two would be difficult because I hardly doubt people will count how much damage they do and try to stay inside the limit if they know there is a chest - this will also allow people to let’s say we have a 10 block destruction limit, people would deliberately plant it at 12 blocks so it isn’t possible for the raider to gain access to it thus finding a loop hole in the rule.</p>
<p>Overall I think it should be down to the moderators distinction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I agree it’s unfair, but it doesn’t deserve a ban, especially since PvP is allowed, and you didn’t allow him ‘peacefully’ into your home</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>David, I agree it may not be against to rule to PvP but I do think it is against the rules to spawn camp at someone’s bed. It IS the same thing as doing it in the protected spawn.</p>
<p>If you can’t seem to trust a players words with <span class="bbcode-b">some</span> sufficient evidence of the crime, then I dunno.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Exactly. This follows the same principle of spawn killing because they’re still technically spawning. They have no chance of stopping the person at all. I personally think the OP has provided enough evidence to at least warn the offender.</p>
<p>If you’ve just spawned (Still potentially loading the map) and the person keeps killing you there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. And what does the person gain out of it apart from knowing they’re gaining an unfair advantage over you, the person will do it to deliberately start trouble, nothing less.</p>
<p>Go in, kill them a few times to get what is required, leave = fair enough</p>
<p>Go in, get whats required, camp at there bed and kill them = not fair</p>
<p>That image clearly shows the offender waiting at his bed, and making no attempt to leave.[/quote]</p>
<p>Though I’d bring this in from another post, regarding the killing of people when they spawn at their own beds. I personally (As you can see from the above) am strongly against this being allowed. As I stated in the quote it is extremely unfair and a player would only do it to spite another player.</p>
<p>It should also come under spawn killing (General spawn area). In short any types of spawn killing where the user is vulnerable should be completely banned. I can say myself being on a slow laptop if I was getting spawn killed not only would I be at a disadvantage game wise but loading the map when spawning creates a ton of lagg furthering my disadvantage.</p>
<p>This in turn sparks arguments and the trouble I spoke of above.</p>

<p>I was referring to stealing in general, someone can easily open some guys door help himself to an unlocked chest (Most of them aren’t even hidden) and leave and no one would be the wiser. If someone sees it as griefing then they can report it but if it’s a simple few bits of damage to gain access to the house I don’t see an issue.</p>
<p>I think they’ll be a clear distinction between chest hunting and griefing as there is between raids and griefing.</p>

<p>As far as stealing, I don’t see any problems with it. Considering you can “steal” (raid) from dungeons, you don’t see the zombie/skeleton/spider/creepers reporting you, do ya? Just because it happens to you, doesn’t mean you can’t do it back.</p>

Well, it is griefing, you are not giving them permission to alter your area (destroying) to get to your secret vault areas (if any). So, unless the chests are hidden in areas that can’t be accessed unless griefed, thieving isn’t a crime worth a ban.[/size]</p>

<p>That should come under the same rule as raids, a minimal damage such as 1-4 blocks before it counts as griefeing. Obviously if they mine holes in every direction of your house it would be griefeing.</p>

<p>Exactly. And besides, in 99% of cases on the server there is just one wall you need to make a hole in and everything else is just walking around. People don’t have 5 layers of protection. And as reyx stated people can take alternatives such as going under.</p>
<p>And even if this was against the rules, how would it be enforced?</p>

              <p>Well on the chest matter, if the person hasn’t locked it, and it’s widely available for the person to see then why shouldn’t they be allowed to tuck in? I mean it is the persons responsibility to hide the unprotected chest anyhow. I think it also adds a lot more fun into the game, it shows you that you have to put your more valuable items into 2 chests and then risk the others.</p>
<p>It also would add extra fun to raiding someones property, or discovering a stray chest.</p>

<p>This issue is something I had a problem with just last night as well. However, my ordeal was mildly drastic to my resources.</p>
<p>In my case, it involves the Nether portals to specifically attack someone without their knowing. As well, I was in my chest, taking out items to use on my under construction wall, only to turn around and find myself killed instantly and their running into my portal.</p>
<p>So tl;dr</p>
<p>1.) Person finds my Nether portal.<br>
2.) I’m unknowingly taking out resources as said person is behind me.<br>
3.) Person waits until I turn around to attack me.<br>
4.) I turn around, only to find myself dead.</p>
<p>Should it be against the rules or not?</p>

<p>So here is what I came up with from the current rules:</p>
<p>[ol][li]No griefing in the game (destroying or doing things with others work without explicit permission from them)<br>
[/li][li]No impersonation; don’t pretend to be someone else[/li]<br>
[li]No flying.[/li]<br>
[li]No one, not even admins, can spawn items or teleport.  Don’t ask.[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-b">PvP Specific Rules:</span><br>
[list type=decimal]<br>
[li]If someone allows you into their home/residence/castle/mine/city etc, peacefully, you may not kill them and they may not kill you until you leave the location and start from there.[/li]<br>
[li]When we conduct organized wars/battles/raids, obviously there will need to be some destruction in order to gain access to the stronghold, kill the defenders, and claim victory.  But the destruction will be limited to the bare minimum required to do this, with no destruction afterwards.  In other words you can tear a hole in my castle wall to gain access to my castle and kill me and my fellow clansman, but don’t destroy anything else afterwards.  Griefing rules apply after the action that is.[/li]<br>
[li]No PvP in the protected spawn area.[/li]<br>
[li]No ‘spawn camping’ at beds where people spawn.[/li]<br>
[/list]<br>
[/li][/ol]</p>
<p>I think most of those are agreed upon, but there has been a lot of debate about ‘stealing’ from chests.  Should this be against the rules?  If so, how could we possibly enforce it?  Big Brother only lets you see who accessed the chest, not who took from it.</p>
<p>Let the debate begin!</p>
