        <p>Personally i believe that the will always be these issues. There are many many people her able to contribute, but there is a face on disagreement over the ideology to accept people who ‘do not help themselves’.<br>
I believe the contempt is not being DRIVEN by ‘those who don’t need naming’, but it has now come to a point where it has now become normal to see, everyday, people who are unable to follow the simplest of rules breading pure contempt in those that were once more than happy to give to a successful community.</p>
<p>It in time, without a doubt, will destroy the site to an even further extent.</p>
<p>Unless there is some give back, in respects of the way people want, or more to the point NEED, the site to operate, there will be no future for it. I agree there must always be a balance and new people must always be allowed to join the community, but lets face it, dictatorship didn’t stay around for years because it was 100% unsuccessful. Rules must be strict and you will find the community will benefit from it as a whole. Unless you agree to tighten down on the small things, i personally believe you will lose the last of the able bodied people you have managed to keep here.</p>
<p>In short:<br>
people will not give when they do not receive, fact.<br>
even if new bright minds come, they will still be EXPECTED to be unable, just due to the current situation of the site, and the pure volume of such people, fact.</p>
<p>I always believe the community ruined the likes of Regex etc. They were always able AND willing to contribute, and immaturity only grew from frustration of the situation as a whole. I can understand people getting upset to a degree when nothing changes - that is a life thing, but i do feel the responses are sometimes the only way people listen and/or learn.</p>
<p>Maybe i waffled there, who knows.</p>

        <p>I dont generally mix in inside talk, but after reading this thread, I missed out 2 points.</p>
<p>Commercial Issues<br>
A filled up active forum pays the bills and keeps it going. Forums grow, nothing you can do about that. As long as you provide the content, they will come. I am unaware of the state of content here, but if it lacks they will flock.</p>
<p>Target Issues<br>
Runescape is a kids game. Average age is probably 14. There are exceptions (hm) but consequently your average registree will be 14. This puts great pressure on the content of these forums -on any RS-cheating board for that matter- since most 14 year olds havent got a clue what they are talking about (no offence). Especially cheaters.  They lack respect, manner or persistence because they simply dont know how to act in a mature way. Nobody has taught them yet how to. This is something you will need to live with. On the bright side: There are a lot of very talented and well mannered 14 years old that have influenced my view of the future in a very positive way. But the average will be dumb. (once again, no offence)</p>
<p>Whether a forum goes down or not is entirely in the hands of <span class="bbcode-b">active staff </span>for <span class="bbcode-b">control </span>and <span class="bbcode-b">active elite</span> for <span class="bbcode-b">content</span>. Setting out the right directions and appointing the right people is crucial. And dont forget: Kaitnieks had, what, like 8000 members when it went down? And 500 in the old days? It is impossible to compare that to a 143k uncontrolled flow of average mindboggingly mindless communication.</p>
<p>I would suggest further layering the forums. Subgroups (Status) actracts people and stimulates them to comply to group specific rules. I dont know how many moderators or admin this board has, but I we (SRL)  gave out small forumpowers to old and trusted Members. It keeps the joint neat and tidy, and its good for the group.</p>
<p>BTW: GJ on the rules, Mopar.</p>
<p>Fawk!</p>
