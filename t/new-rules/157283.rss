    <title>New Rules</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-rules/157283</link>
    <description>It seems clear that a major revision of the rules is needed.  I suggest a new format as well, splitting them up into sections.  However, they must follow the KISS principle, Keep It Simple Stupid.

The operative words here being short, simple, clear and concise.

Here are the new rules the staff has came up with so far, mostly it is just a reorganization of the existing rules.

[quote=&quot;Moparisthebest, post:1, topic:223&quot;][center][size=14pt][b]Moparisthebest.com and Moparscape.org Rules[/b][/size][/center]

[size=12pt][u][b]Primary rules[/b][/u]

1. If you don&#39;t have anything nice to say, don&#39;t say anything at all.

2. Use common sense.[/size]

The staff reserves the right to interpret these primary rules any way we see fit, for example while posting child porn is not specifically against the rules, it should be common sense that it is not allowed.

[u][b]Ideals[/b][/u]

Rule 1:
We are not anti-leech. If you respect our community and our ideas, feel free to ask questions and they will be kindly answered if you follow other rules. Answer to questions that others ask if you know the answer or remain silent!

Rule 2:
We don&#39;t talk about things we don&#39;t know. This is an informative, not a misinformative community.

Rule 3:
We respect each other and other communities. We don&#39;t flame each other or other communities. We don&#39;t fight on the forums.

Rule 4:
We don&#39;t care about post count alone. If someone has high post count and most of it is spam, we hate them. If someone has high post count with informative posts, we love them. The higher count, the more we hate/love them.

Rule 5:
We never ask for &quot;rep&quot;.

[u][b]Posts / Topics[/b][/u]

Rule 6:
We don&#39;t make spelling mistakes on purpose. We use &quot;you&quot; not &quot;u&quot;, we use &quot;why&quot; not &quot;y&quot; etc.

Rule 7:
We don&#39;t make posts that contain not useful information. Posts like &quot;cool&quot;, &quot;lol&quot;, &quot;yeah&quot; and &quot;I agree&quot; don&#39;t contain anything useful for others. We are not fans of off topic, unless it contains something smart or funny. Most of things spammers find funny are actually not funny at all.

Rule 8:
We don&#39;t &quot;Bump&quot; or double post whether on purpose or by accident.  Use the edit button instead.  You are however, allowed to post in old topics if it is relevant to your problem.

Rule 9:
Nothing to do with private servers belongs on moparisthebest.com, use [url=http://moparisthebest.com/smf]moparisthebest.com/smf[/url] for these things.

Rule 10:
DO [b]NOT[/b] post or upload any copyrighted materials, ie deobs, clients or any other sort (however if you were to link to a file that was uploaded somewhere else or post code in the pasteBin, well, I would have no control over that right? ;) )

[u][b]Buying / Selling[/b][/u]

Rule 11:
We do [b]not[/b] sell anything on this site with the exception of SCAR scripts.  SCAR Scripts must be verified, check the script sales board for more info.

[u][b]Accounts[/b][/u]

Rule 12:
We only have [b]one[/b] Forum account per person for Moparisthebest.com and Moparscape.org.  If you get banned, email an admin, or get a friend to contact an admin.  If you have trouble logging in, click &#39;forgot my password.&#39;

[u][b]Linking / Advertisement[/b][/u]

Rule 13:
We don&#39;t advertise other sites or communities unless we ask and receive permission to from a Gmod or Admin. We don&#39;t post links to sites that are not in safe sites list on Moparisthebest.com main page. 

Rule 14:
We never advertise via the PM system whether the site is approved or not.

Rule 15:
We never have misleading links in our signatures [b]or[/b] posts.  If a link says google.com, we expect it to take us to google.com.

We&#39;re not asking much,

Thank you

<p>Something like:<br>

According to the current topic of <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span>, all rules of <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> apply to <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span>.</p>

The “exploit” topic i talk about is both FireFox and SMF problems, you should add a mod that you must end the BBcode and the Started BBcode is Equal to Closed.<br>
Then you remove that problem so was it that topic.</p>

<p>Well here’s a suggestion…<br>
A rule that states no inappropriate content?</p>
<p>Just an idea.</p>

              <p>I’ll add those rep guidelines to this post once I have finished them, just doing them now.</p>
<p>EDIT: So far. No formatting as of yet as they aren’t finished or ordered.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Rules regarding the reputation system:

-Rep should not be traded/sold or asked for - Ever.
-Rep should never be asked for or requested, whether in a post, signature or PM.
-Rep should not be abused, if it is, you will be warned or banned.
-Nobody can rep a single person more than once over a 168 hour (1 week) period.
-Your "reputation power" is based off your current reputation , rep power basically is the amount of rep you will increase someone else by based on the rep you already have. The formula for this is as follows, note once you reach 15 it ceases to rise.

The following are guidelines for use of the reputation system, they are in place to help make the system work properly and fairly and to provide users a better understanding for when it is correct to increase another's reputation.
Remember these are guidelines and not rules, you should make your own interpretations of them

-Reputation generally should not be awarded for a one-off post, unless that post is of some abnormal length and depth of explanation.It should be based over a series of posts, after all you can only give one reputation increase to one person once per week.
-If a user has helped you in someway, it does not matter what area or to what degree if they have been genuinely helpful and have continued to do so throughout a topic or via PM then this would be a worthy reputation increase.
-If a user posts a program/code/tutorial that they themselves have made from scratch, and you have found it to be useful and helpful then increasing their reputation due to their hard work is a satisfactory way of saying thank you. If you have issues and they help you then this would be a an even more appropriate situation, if they do not then you must rethink what their motives were and come to an educated decision on whether they deserve it.
-Make sure the information given is correct before adding to someones repuation, false information or ripped work/code can be a common problem you should always check that a person is a genuine before thanking or repping them, That said it can sometimes be difficult to confirm the validity of something, if this is the case just hand on for a while and see how others are reacting to the content but only rep if it actually helped you. 
-Someone who is helpful in one section but not in another does not deserve rep increases, rep is seen globally on the forum and therefore it would be misleading for users of another part of the forum to have someone with a high repuation count flaming them.
-You should only increase the rep of people whom have helped you, not people who have helped someone else, unless of course the effort in which they put into helping someone was truly substantial or you yourself found the information particularly useful and informative.
-Reputation is not a representation of power or knowledge, although in most cases a person with a high reputation count will be very knowledgeable reputation is more a mark of how helpful they are and therefore how respected they are within the community.
-Rep isn't really something that should be given out sparingly, it will never run out, it is not a non-renewable resource. So it doesn't have to be a once a month occasion. Many people cannot be bothered often to use the system but by not using it you stop the system from working correctly. On the other hand, rep shouldn't be used as if it was in excess,by following these guidelines hopefully you can now make informed decisions on when it is appropriate and when it is not. </code></pre>
<p>C&amp;C where you see fit, some need to be more concise probably but these are guidelines not rules, except for the top part.</p>

              <p>It seems clear that a major revision of the rules is needed.  I suggest a new format as well, splitting them up into sections.  However, they must follow the KISS principle, Keep It Simple Stupid.</p>
<p>The operative words here being short, simple, clear and concise.</p>
<p>Here are the new rules the staff has came up with so far, mostly it is just a reorganization of the existing rules.</p>
<p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:1, topic:223”][center][size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="http://Moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparisthebest.com</a> and <a href="http://Moparscape.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparscape.org</a> Rules</span>[/size][/center]</p>
<p>[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Primary rules</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use common sense.[/size]</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The staff reserves the right to interpret these primary rules any way we see fit, for example while posting child porn is not specifically against the rules, it should be common sense that it is not allowed.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Ideals</span></span></p>
<p>Rule 1:<br>
We are not anti-leech. If you respect our community and our ideas, feel free to ask questions and they will be kindly answered if you follow other rules. Answer to questions that others ask if you know the answer or remain silent!</p>
<p>Rule 2:<br>
We don’t talk about things we don’t know. This is an informative, not a misinformative community.</p>
<p>Rule 3:<br>
We respect each other and other communities. We don’t flame each other or other communities. We don’t fight on the forums.</p>
<p>Rule 4:<br>
We don’t care about post count alone. If someone has high post count and most of it is spam, we hate them. If someone has high post count with informative posts, we love them. The higher count, the more we hate/love them.</p>
<p>Rule 5:<br>
We never ask for “rep”.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Posts / Topics</span></span></p>
<p>Rule 6:<br>
We don’t make spelling mistakes on purpose. We use “you” not “u”, we use “why” not “y” etc.</p>
<p>Rule 7:<br>
We don’t make posts that contain not useful information. Posts like “cool”, “lol”, “yeah” and “I agree” don’t contain anything useful for others. We are not fans of off topic, unless it contains something smart or funny. Most of things spammers find funny are actually not funny at all.</p>
<p>Rule 8:<br>
We don’t “Bump” or double post whether on purpose or by accident.  Use the edit button instead.  You are however, allowed to post in old topics if it is relevant to your problem.</p>
<p>Rule 9:<br>
Nothing to do with private servers belongs on <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a>, use <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com/smf</a> for these things.</p>
<p>Rule 10:<br>
DO <span class="bbcode-b">NOT</span> post or upload any copyrighted materials, ie deobs, clients or any other sort (however if you were to link to a file that was uploaded somewhere else or post code in the pasteBin, well, I would have no control over that right? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> )</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Buying / Selling</span></span></p>
<p>Rule 11:<br>
We do <span class="bbcode-b">not</span> sell anything on this site with the exception of SCAR scripts.  SCAR Scripts must be verified, check the script sales board for more info.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Accounts</span></span></p>
<p>Rule 12:<br>
We only have <span class="bbcode-b">one</span> Forum account per person for <a href="http://Moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparisthebest.com</a> and <a href="http://Moparscape.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparscape.org</a>.  If you get banned, email an admin, or get a friend to contact an admin.  If you have trouble logging in, click ‘forgot my password.’</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Linking / Advertisement</span></span></p>
<p>Rule 13:<br>
We don’t advertise other sites or communities unless we ask and receive permission to from a Gmod or Admin. We don’t post links to sites that are not in safe sites list on <a href="http://Moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparisthebest.com</a> main page.</p>
<p>Rule 14:<br>
We never advertise via the PM system whether the site is approved or not.</p>
<p>Rule 15:<br>
We never have misleading links in our signatures <span class="bbcode-b">or</span> posts.  If a link says <a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">google.com</a>, we expect it to take us to <a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">google.com</a>.</p>
<p>We’re not asking much,</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Moparisthebest and Moparscape Moderation Team[/quote]</p>
<p>I am opening this up the general public to get everyone’s input, please post what you would like to see added or removed, what needs clarified or simplified, etc etc.</p>
