    <description>[u]Project Olympus[/u]

Hello, I have currently started making a new server called Project Olympus from an un-edited TestScape source of course and I would like a team with me (not that I don&#39;t know how to code, I do) to make a very unique server. When finished, every person doing it will get a copy of the finished source and they can do whatever they want with it (claim it theirs, edit it the way they want to). Only 3-4 people are needed, and forums are not necessary, but if someone wants to make forums, go ahead  :P

Hopefully YOU will join. (People who think that adding a npc is a mark of a good coder are not accepted)
