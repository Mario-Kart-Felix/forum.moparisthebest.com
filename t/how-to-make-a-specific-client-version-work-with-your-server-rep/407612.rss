    <title>How to Make a Specific Client Version Work with Your Server Rep++</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-a-specific-client-version-work-with-your-server-rep/407612</link>
    <description>How do I make a specific version of a client only work with my server? For example, I update the cache but others may not know they need to update it. How do I make a client that will not work when I want it to not work?

Please help,


TheCyberMan


EDIT: Let me help you guys. This is in the server&#39;s client.java:

			if(uid == 24239212) {
				returnCode = 6;
				disconnected = true;
				out.write(6);
				//misc.println(playerName+&quot; is using the official client.&quot;);
				misc.println(playerName+&quot; tried using the version 1 client.&quot;);
				return;
			}

This is in the client&#39;s client.java:

            if(k == 6) {
                aString1266 = &quot;@yel@The client has been updated.&quot;;
                aString1267 = &quot;@yel@Please redownload it from the forums.&quot;;
				BrowserControl.displayURL(&quot;http://www.linktoforums.com/&quot;);
                return;
            }</description>
