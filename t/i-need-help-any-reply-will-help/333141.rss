    <description>Well, I&#39;m back with more questions and problems, any answer is greatly appreciated.

Well, I have a problem, when my character dies in pvp or pvn, both ways, he loses nothing, and in pvp, i would like him to lose items, how do I do that?

Also, I have no clue how to add a drop to my npc.
Does anyone know how?

I would like to add customs aswell, but they always override something else, causing a &quot;null&quot;, can someone tell me how to fix this?
And another thing, how do I put them in the right slot, like a cape in the cape slot?
Also, if any of you wouldn&#39;t mind showing me how to add stats to my items too, and making them hit properly.

Thanks for the help guys, any answer or reply is helpful.</description>
