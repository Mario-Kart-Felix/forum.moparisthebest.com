    <title>&quot;Could not find the main class: client. Program will exit.&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/could-not-find-the-main-class-client-program-will-exit/401980</link>
    <description>When I jarred and signed my client. I then tried to run it and see if it was okay to make a webclient. Then that came up, I don&#39;t know if it makes any difference but I have a Class and a Java folder. So there is just the runs and compilers in the main part of the folder. If you have any idea how to fix this, please help.</description>
