    <description>Yeah I keep getting this guy on my server - saying go to rune-kill.no-ip.biz. 

First off, he has the command to &quot;::yell&quot; when in reality,

you have to do &quot;::say&quot;. And I don&#39;t think he&#39;s checked up on it because it&#39;s still going. 

I ip&#39;d both his addresses he&#39;s using, but he still floods the command prompt box that comes up when you run the server. And nobody can log on. -.-

If you wanna see a picture,
