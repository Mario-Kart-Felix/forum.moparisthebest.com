    <title>Help cracking RSC combat formulae please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-cracking-rsc-combat-formulae-please/422504</link>
    <description>Hi,

I&#39;m collecting a lot of combat data from the official RSC game over the coming weeks (along with other skill data etc.) since I&#39;ve no real-life commitments for the next 3-4 months and I had a question or two relating to the NPCDef.xml file in the config files used in EasyRSC.

How exactly were each NPC&#39;s &lt;attack&gt;, &lt;strength&gt;, &lt;hits&gt;, &lt;defense&gt;, &lt;respawnTime&gt; etc. numbers found? Were they found by (I don&#39;t really understand this I&#39;m just using a term a friend of mine told me) deobbing the RSC client?

If it was found via deobbing the RSC client, how much other data could we extract from deobbing that we haven&#39;t already? Anything of use for replicating RSC?

Thanks in advanced :)</description>

              <p>An update on my progress on replicating RSC: Using Cremeans (a friend of mine) lvl 70-99 Agility recorded fail rates on Wilderness Agility Course I was able to demonstrate a linear relationship between agility level and success rate for all obstacles (all 3 obstacles, rope, lava and pit had essentially the same fail rate) but I’m still working on replicating the amount of “randomness” in the fail rates (RSC formulae tend to have unexpectedly large amount of deviation from one trial to another). The first few weeks of my second year stat course dealt with the type of statistics RSC uses (Bernoulli trials where the outcome is random and can be either True or False) but I’m going to analyse most of the data all at once once I have enough. Here’s the agility fail rates as a function of agility level for the 3 failable obstacles in the Wildy course.</p>

<p><img src="http://img267.imageshack.us/img267/4060/failratevsagilitylevelw.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Also an old graph I made probably a year ago from thieving men from level 1-24:</p>
<p><img src="http://img832.imageshack.us/img832/3689/thievingdata.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>The major problem I’m having is data collection - so far I’ve been collecting data by hand (which sometimes results in counting errors when I’m listening to audio books or not focusing after long periods of collecting) and also being limited to only 3 low-mid levelled active accounts it’s hard to get data for the higher levels. So I’m requesting help from this community in either botting the data (preferably! The free Auto Rune bot could easily be used as a data collection bot, though I’m not sure how to write to a file in Java…) or legitly (like I’ve been doing) collecting the data for 3 skills I still need data for: mining (all rocks), thieving (all thievable NPC’s) and woodcutting (all trees).</p>
<p>When recording mining data, if you “slip and fail to hit the rock”, which causes the mining loop to end, record that as a regular fail and keep going (too much effort to handle the very rare ‘slip and fail’ outcome, from lvl 1-40 mining I only got the slip and fail result maybe 5 times). Just use notepad or any other software to record the following: current level, type of tree/rock/NPC you’re WCing, mining or thieving, type of tool you’re using and make sure to collect at least 100+ trials (fails and successes both count) in each data set (use 100% fatigue for thieving data). 1 hours effort could go a long way helping replicate skill success formulae if you have a high level miner, woodcutter or thief!</p>
<p>I’m still curious about the NPC’s .xml file - it has all the NPC’s HP lvls which would be nearly impossible to have manually determined or just guessed, so I wonder if I should use the NPC’s ,  and  variables written in the .xml file for when I try to crack the combat formulae…So again, does anyone know anything about the origin of the    variables in the NPC .xml file?? (ie. how reliable are these variables)</p>
<p>Also, I’d like to confirm that the functions NpcTalk(""); PlayerTalk(""); SendMessage(""); option1 = PickOption(“option 1 goes here”, “option 2 goes here”); will definitely be usable in either RSCD or xEnt’s new RSC source because I’ve easily spent hundreds of hours writing quests using these functions and definitely want my work useable! I’ve written the NPC chat files for 98 NPC’s so far with some 10-30 quests fully coded (I’ve commented out some functions which I don’t think exist but would be needed, like player.MoveTo(x,y) and player.TeleportTo(x,y) and player.Damage(ceil(player.curHP/2)) (I’m not familiar with all the available functions in RSCD but I’m certain after coding so much that many of the RSCD’s ‘player’, ‘object’, etc. (classes? modules? whatever :P) functions are redundant and can be reduced to a much smaller number of functions).</p>
<p>I know I haven’t written much of my post succinctly (I swear I have formal thought disorder lol) but I hope people can interpret what I’m trying to convey in the post and attempt to address the points and not get side tracked by personal attacks on others (this is not attacking anyone, it’s just an observation from browsing these forums for a while now :P), thanks <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I still say that’s pretty accurate to RSC… Probably lowering the chance of the max hit and slightly lowering accuracy would suffice. Most people don’t remember how RSC was.</p>
<p>I logged into an RSC account and attacked a chicken last night. I hit a 1, 0 and dead (stats are 79 80 82) with dragon long and dragon amulet. If this were to happen in a RSC server people would think the formula “sucks”, but they don’t remember it happening on RSC.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah memory might be failing me, but I used to pk lvl 10 to 28lvl most of my times while playing rsc. Most<br>
of my pures were mith and black pures. In rsc you could 1v1 someone and if lucky get a 3 hit and fights were moderately long. but in this servers<br>
the fights drag on forever and if you are beyond luck you can 3 hit someone with pot and range.</p>

<p>Edit: Now I have some form of clarification of the process. I didn’t create an image, though, but I hope a text document will do. Here it is:</p>
<p>[code]<br>
 = …<br>
 = …<br>
 = …<br>
 += ( * )<br>
 += ( * )<br>
 = …</p>
<p> = …<br>
 = …<br>
 = …<br>
 += ( * )<br>
 += ( * )<br>
 = …</p>
<p> = (( +  +  + ) / 100)<br>
 = ( + ) / <br>
 = ( + ) / <br>
 = &lt;0…99&gt;</p>
<p>[00][01][02][03][04][05][06][07][08][09]<br>
[10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19]<br>
[20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29]<br>
[30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39]<br>
[40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49]<br>
[50][51][52][53][54][55][56][57][58][59]<br>

[90][91][92][93][94][95][96][97][98][99]</p>
<p>IF  &lt;= <br>
 = TRUE<br>
ELSE<br>
 = FALSE</p>
<p>Clarification:</p>
<p>The matrix will be divided percentually correct based on one players statistics compared to another players statistics.<br>
Two players with exact equal statistics, will have the same amount of positions in the matrix. There are 100 positions<br>
in the matrix - 1 per percent. The initial positions will be handed over to the attacker at all times. The more of the<br>
positions the attacker gets, the higher chance he has to hit. The less positions the attacker gets, the less chance he<br>
has to hit. The random number is as random as the built-in PRNG can produce.</p>
<p>If a hit is successful, the default calculation of hitting is done. This may, or may not (depending on who writes the<br>
code), produce a hit of 0. Some people perhaps prefers to keep a successful hit at 1 as a minimum, others perhaps wants<br>
a 0 as the minimum of a successful hit.<br>

<p>All you can really do is examine it and average the results in different situations.

You take you and your opponents stats / fight mode / weapon [aim / power], etc, and then what? Even the max hit calculators aren’t 100% accurate to the decimal. Also from what I remember the NPC stats weren’t found as they themselves weren’t entirely accurate. IE chickens hitting 2 and KBDs being invincible on some servers.

              <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’m collecting a lot of combat data from the official RSC game over the coming weeks (along with other skill data etc.) since I’ve no real-life commitments for the next 3-4 months and I had a question or two relating to the NPCDef.xml file in the config files used in EasyRSC.</p>
<p>How exactly were each NPC’s , , , ,  etc. numbers found? Were they found by (I don’t really understand this I’m just using a term a friend of mine told me) deobbing the RSC client?</p>
<p>If it was found via deobbing the RSC client, how much other data could we extract from deobbing that we haven’t already? Anything of use for replicating RSC?</p>
<p>Thanks in advanced <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
