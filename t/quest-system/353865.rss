    <description>how would you do it?
personally i think modelling the quests as state machines and abstracting event listening code into a set of &#39;action interests&#39; per quest would be interesting. to elaborate on that, every &#39;action&#39; a player does, such as use an item, cast a spell, or open an object, is put into a linear queue per player in my design. actions are fired as events to any listeners, which should be implemented by content scripts. a quest would be implemented over my quest model in a script with a set of states (stages or whatnot) which model progress, and would display interest in actions of different types (as to decouple quest logic from prerequisites), such as using the item Secret Key on the specific door at 347,233</description>

<p>Yong’s system (which isn’t really a “system”, I coded something like that before him as well)<br>
and RSCA’s which I guess is probably done a bit better, but I’m unsure.</p>
