    <title>Private servers should allow for afktraining/autoing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/private-servers-should-allow-for-afktraining-autoing/224126</link>
    <description>Don&#39;t you think so? I think that the reason private servers are not as popular as it should be is because most of us(RSC players - take note that very few new players actually enter the scene) are older now and do not have much time for RSC anymore. Furthermore, no one wants to risk putting in so much effort for a possibility(quite high actually) that the server may shut down. 

Allowing afk training or autoing will bring about...
[u]Pros [/u]
- Many more people will be playing RSC again
- Most private servers will become active since players just have to leave their clients on and can actively play on multiple servers
- The games&#39; economies will grow much faster; Items will reach an equilibrated price faster(I do not really know how to explain this because I do not study economics but I know how economies work)
- It allows for the rsc or rscd type of servers(which are personally my favourite type) to resurface instead of all servers being based on storkpk&#39;s.
- Admins/mods no longer need to have the responsibility of banning players
- It saves alot of the players&#39; time, and players will take the game less seriously and so this may lead to a better community in-game.

[u]Cons[/u]
- Server owners will need to upgrade their servers to accommodate e the many more people that will be playing
- Many people are going to end up with similiar stats - for example, three smithers racing to 99 will probably progress at the same pace and so it takes away the competition.


This thought just came to my mind an hour ago and I thought I should post it and see what others think about it.. and I urge someone to launch a server based on this idea and see the results,</description>

              <p>I agree with somewhat of what you have to say. I mean, “AFKing” should be allowed seeing as how it’s apart of every game, including real RuneScape. Macroing (“autoing”), however, shouldn’t be allowed, it just ruins the game.</p>

              <p>tbh ko9, its fair for everyone if everyone autos. but yea… i wouldn’t think it’d be a good idea for you to allow autoing as your server has been around for 3 months already which means many people have trained their asses off.</p>
<p>p.S: Could you upload your client to a different hoster, i can’t d/l from rapidshare and upit seems have deleted the file</p>

              <p>I’m really split on this topic tbh part of me wants to just allow autoing on my server and be done with it. But the other part of me feels sorry for all of the players on there who have already trained their asses off and the many more that want to play in a fair environment.</p>
<p>The problem is, you can implement methods upon methods upon methods of anti-cheating [methods], but if your server is popular there are always people who are going to get around them. (Think copyright RIAA/MPAA etc but on a [much] smaller scale).</p>
<p>Then there’s the fact that none of us are Jagex… If you ban someone from your server they will [more-than likely] go to another server and seeing as this entire community was born from the RSC cheating community I’d be confident in saying a large portion of people playing RSC private servers have botted on RSC at one point or another.</p>

              <p>either way you would still be paying for the server, i think admins would be glad to see many more people on their servers. Most of us here had been autoing on RSC before we went on to private servers, and I’m sure many would agree that autoing has been and still part of RSC.</p>

              <p>Don’t you think so? I think that the reason private servers are not as popular as it should be is because most of us(RSC players - take note that very few new players actually enter the scene) are older now and do not have much time for RSC anymore. Furthermore, no one wants to risk putting in so much effort for a possibility(quite high actually) that the server may shut down.</p>
<p>Allowing afk training or autoing will bring about…<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Pros </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Many more people will be playing RSC again</li>
<li>Most private servers will become active since players just have to leave their clients on and can actively play on multiple servers</li>
<li>The games’ economies will grow much faster; Items will reach an equilibrated price faster(I do not really know how to explain this because I do not study economics but I know how economies work)</li>
<li>It allows for the rsc or rscd type of servers(which are personally my favourite type) to resurface instead of all servers being based on storkpk’s.</li>
<li>Admins/mods no longer need to have the responsibility of banning players</li>
<li>It saves alot of the players’ time, and players will take the game less seriously and so this may lead to a better community in-game.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Cons</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Server owners will need to upgrade their servers to accommodate e the many more people that will be playing</li>
<li>Many people are going to end up with similiar stats - for example, three smithers racing to 99 will probably progress at the same pace and so it takes away the competition.</li>
</ul>
<p>This thought just came to my mind an hour ago and I thought I should post it and see what others think about it… and I urge someone to launch a server based on this idea and see the results,</p>
