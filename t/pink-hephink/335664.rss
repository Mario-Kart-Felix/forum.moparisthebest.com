    <description>Have you ever seen a pink hephink?
It is no coincidence you have not.
You most likely have although don’t think,
Because it is an easy thing to have forgot.

You see, the pink hephink can do amazing things,
With both its body and its mind.
It can control you as though you were hanging from strings,
As though your soul to it you signed.

Why would you have forgot you may wonder,
Well as your actions it can change,
So may it produce a mental blunder,
Memories discarded is not that strange.

So if you’re wondering what is its ensemble,
You would not be the first to think.
No ones knows of what or not it does resemble,
Merely that it is pink, the hephink.

Some say it looks like a giraffe,
Looking far for things to do.
Some mention it has a laugh,
Similar to the sound of a gorilla too.

Talk of its size does greatly differ,
As it seems unique every sight.
Some say a mouse others bigger,
For one it were taller than his kite.

There is one thing I can say though,
This point is much agreed valid.
A piece of knowledge worthy to sow,
Something that should not be hid.

If you see a pink hephink,
Run – run fast and as long as you can.
No matter quite what you may think,
It is too much for any man.</description>
