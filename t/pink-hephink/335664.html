        <p>Have you ever seen a pink hephink?<br>
It is no coincidence you have not.<br>
You most likely have although don’t think,<br>
Because it is an easy thing to have forgot.</p>
<p>You see, the pink hephink can do amazing things,<br>
With both its body and its mind.<br>
It can control you as though you were hanging from strings,<br>
As though your soul to it you signed.</p>
<p>Why would you have forgot you may wonder,<br>
Well as your actions it can change,<br>
So may it produce a mental blunder,<br>
Memories discarded is not that strange.</p>
<p>So if you’re wondering what is its ensemble,<br>
You would not be the first to think.<br>
No ones knows of what or not it does resemble,<br>
Merely that it is pink, the hephink.</p>
<p>Some say it looks like a giraffe,<br>
Looking far for things to do.<br>
Some mention it has a laugh,<br>
Similar to the sound of a gorilla too.</p>
<p>Talk of its size does greatly differ,<br>
As it seems unique every sight.<br>
Some say a mouse others bigger,<br>
For one it were taller than his kite.</p>
<p>There is one thing I can say though,<br>
This point is much agreed valid.<br>
A piece of knowledge worthy to sow,<br>
Something that should not be hid.</p>
<p>If you see a pink hephink,<br>
Run – run fast and as long as you can.<br>
No matter quite what you may think,<br>
It is too much for any man.</p>
