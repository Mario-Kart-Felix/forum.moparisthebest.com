    <title>[667+]need help with hourly points</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/667-need-help-with-hourly-points/454699</link>
    <description>I&#39;d like to make a system with Hourly points, for every 1 hour your logged in, you&#39;ll get a reward.

It&#39;s possible in NRS3&#39;s source but im not using that source anymore,


However i tried converting it from NRS3&#39;s to the new one i&#39;m using,
but the one i&#39;m using has no folders for events and i tried importing them and that didn&#39;t work either.


Can i get help with this?</description>
