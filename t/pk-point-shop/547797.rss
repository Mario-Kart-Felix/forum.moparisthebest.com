    <title>Pk point shop</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pk-point-shop/547797</link>
    <description>Okay im having this issue with my server&#39;s pk point shop it will not let me buy anything out of it even tho I had gave myself enough pk points to buy an item from the store..... its only letting me sell stuff to it and get cash like u see below. I&#39;m pretty positive it has something to do with the shops ID but im not sure what to set the npc&#39;s ID to inside of shopassiasnt.java and I don&#39;t know this npc&#39;s ID so its a little hard to find.</description>

              <p>Buy and sell both, I know what you mean it had the number 2. Which means sell/buy so I changed it to 1 for just buy but still nothing I can show you my pk shop stuff.</p>
<p>basically the first part in shop.cfg<br>
Points_Shop	1	1	<br>
shop = 30	Pk_Points_Shop_2	1	1<br>
then this below is in a text document called shops or maybe (shops.java)?<br>
then the attachment is my shopassitance.java</p>
