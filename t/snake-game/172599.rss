    <title>Snake Game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/snake-game/172599</link>
    <description>Snake game, like the ones that come with some mobile phones.

while i was making this, i got a little hooked on it, i really didnt know it was possible to be hooked on
a game you created yourself :p

A long time ago, i tried to make a game like this in SCAR, however i did not think out the
structure very well, and there were some very annoying bugs which my bad structure was not able
to fix, so i scrapped the project.

a few days ago, i got some inspiration on a good structure, i wrote some pseudocode and managed to
create this system, i feel it is well made, the only failing of it is that i did not remember
about LinkedList&#39;s throwing of a ConcurrentModificationException when it was edited during iteration,
so i had to make a messy fix and have a field to store the new segment until iteration was finished.

i made next to nothing effort for the graphics, it was only to try to see if my idea for the structure
would work, however, there are many polymorphic methods which are used for rendering and drawing, and if
anyone wants to try to improve the graphics, the structure will allow them without too many difficulties.

this project uses Apache ANT (google it) to compile, if you program in java, i highly recommend you get
this open-sourced tool.

speaking of which, open sourcing is the best thing since the stream engine, its only those evil capitalists
at microsoft who are only intrested in money who hold back open sourcing and human development.

              <p><a class="mention" href="/u/ephemeral">@ephemeral</a> that would work too, but I just really like LinkedList, it models the snake very well, there are many places i use getFirst() to get the head and addLast() when you eat food, or maybe Im just falling into that premature optimisation trap, i bet if you used CopyOnWrite, you wouldnt notice that much difference in performance.</p>
<p>on the version of this i have on my phone, if you hit the wall, you come out on the opposite side, some old mario games used to have that as well.</p>
<p>its not true that open sourcing leads to no money, Sun Microsystems make money, Red Hat makes money, MySQL makes money. You guys have be mislead, its always in the upper classes best interests to keep its population ignorant, and thats exactly what its doing.</p>
<p>I’m not saying everything should be open source, like making Halo3 open source is a waste of time because the people who play that simply wont be interested, but for programs which are used by developers, being open source is very important, Compilers, Debuggers, IDEs, runtime environments. Since all the people who use these know how to look through source code, if they notice a problem, they would find it and fix it. The closed sourcing of IDEA and MS Visual Studios is a really stupid idea and totally fueled by greed.</p>
<p>IDEA even has to resort to shameless advertising at the top of everyone’s source code, Eclipse and Netbeans have no need for this.</p>

<p>Radio and Television obviously offer information as their commodity, and when they first came out, they required payment. When the first companies started making their services free, there was a similar reaction to open sourcing of today. But the media discovered another way to pay for themselves: Advertising.</p>
<p>The closed source community needs to learn that written software is not the only commodity you can offer.</p>

              <p>The ConcurrentModificationException could easily be solved using a java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList. However, it does require more time to add/remove Objects to it, but might be worth using in complex systems (not that I think your system is too complex, but anyway).</p>
<p>Microsoft also have said that they will go open sourced, so I have heard. Well, atleast the Visual Studio library.</p>
<p>Else than that, it looks nice! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Snake game, like the ones that come with some mobile phones.</p>
<p>while i was making this, i got a little hooked on it, i really didnt know it was possible to be hooked on<br>
a game you created yourself <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>A long time ago, i tried to make a game like this in SCAR, however i did not think out the<br>
structure very well, and there were some very annoying bugs which my bad structure was not able<br>
to fix, so i scrapped the project.</p>
<p>a few days ago, i got some inspiration on a good structure, i wrote some pseudocode and managed to<br>
create this system, i feel it is well made, the only failing of it is that i did not remember<br>
about LinkedList’s throwing of a ConcurrentModificationException when it was edited during iteration,<br>
so i had to make a messy fix and have a field to store the new segment until iteration was finished.</p>
<p>i made next to nothing effort for the graphics, it was only to try to see if my idea for the structure<br>
would work, however, there are many polymorphic methods which are used for rendering and drawing, and if<br>
anyone wants to try to improve the graphics, the structure will allow them without too many difficulties.</p>
<p>this project uses Apache ANT (google it) to compile, if you program in java, i highly recommend you get<br>
this open-sourced tool.</p>
<p>speaking of which, open sourcing is the best thing since the stream engine, its only those evil capitalists<br>
at microsoft who are only intrested in money who hold back open sourcing and human development.</p>
