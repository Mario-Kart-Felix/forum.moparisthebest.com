    <description>ok you can flame all you want i just won&#39;t reply, this is a recolour and the pl8,legs,and boots r just added b.c it fits the set, the helm and cape were recoloured.

i just want to know your opinion on things and how it may look in game for a npc, nothing more, any epic flamming, ill get this locked to stop idc. this is my spare time work and this was just something i made to try to start to learn to animate in meta, but for some reason the boxes dont show up so i can move it and etc.

HAPPY ! :)


P.S(colour in game is more, ehh faint? i guess, iunno darker? b.c its supose to be more so old.

              <p>it’s so basic to combined armour pieces to make a npc like this, follow SilentCj’s tutorial on using meta and get rsmv, simply convert the models you like from rsmv upload to meta and the fit piece by piece, but i dont suggest just posting them, edit them a bit like i did, hense EDIT THEM A BIT b.c you will get flamed, eg the bandos helm i made was and edit in the set, and the arma sheild.</p>

<p>Here is my piece: Newcommers are like puppys. If they come in here and post a recolor, they get praised. They like the feling of getting praised so they do it again. They eventually are TOUGHT to be recolorers instead of modellers because they get praise for they’re useless work.</p>
<p>MY strategy is to make recolorers feel bad for doing that, then eventually mould them into the great modeller they can possibly be in the near future. So next time: post real models, post your own work, get praised for it, build up a good reputation. Thats how this community thrives and functions.[/quote]</p>

              <p>Will you show me REAL work instead of this? I just want to shape newcomers into the best modellers they can possibly be.</p>
<p>Here is my piece: Newcommers are like puppys. If they come in here and post a recolor, they get praised. They like the feling of getting praised so they do it again. They eventually are TOUGHT to be recolorers instead of modellers because they get praise for they’re useless work.</p>
<p>MY strategy is to make recolorers feel bad for doing that, then eventually mould them into the great modeller they can possibly be in the near future. So next time: post real models, post your own work, get praised for it, build up a good reputation. Thats how this community thrives and functions.</p>

And also, i do like them ( ;O ), but they need animating, kinda pointless when they just float around in game.</p>
