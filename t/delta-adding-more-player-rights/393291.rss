              <p>You don’t necessarily have to have donors require a specific playerright, this all depends on the client. Though most Client have it through playerrights so have it through Donor, which you can declare as</p>
<p>Donor = 0 mean not donator<br>
Donor = 1 means the player is a donator</p>

              <p>Well you can’t just make up a player right for Co-Owner. You either make co-owner player rights 2 or 3 and then when you do a ::yell command you just make it set to that persons name so it says [Co-Owner]. For donator I think you might be able to add into the character file something like isdonator = ___  (MAYBE) Im not to sure about that. You could also make donator so its player rights 4. Just be careful you dont make any admin commands available to them.</p>
