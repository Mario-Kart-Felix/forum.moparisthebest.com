    <title>RS3 Releases their lastest skill, Invention, and someone already has 99</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rs3-releases-their-lastest-skill-invention-and-someone-already-has-99/554556</link>
    <description>This is ridiculous. The skill literally [i]just[/i] came out on the 25th (Around 7/8am my time).
[url=http://services.runescape.com/m=hiscore/ranking?category_type=0&amp;table=27&amp;page=1]Yet people are already almost at 120[/url]

Not only that, but this skill is unique in quite a few ways.
The XP to get 99? 36,073,511
The XP to get 120? 80,618,654

Not only that, but it&#39;s an &#39;elite&#39; skill which requires you to have 3 skills also at level 80 (Div/Craft/Smith). Just to start training.


Someone in my clan reported that the guy with 103, actually has 110, but that could be due to the hiscores not updating until the player logs out.</description>

But they just did a system update (not even 10 mins ago), and they nerfed a bunch of stuff.<br>
