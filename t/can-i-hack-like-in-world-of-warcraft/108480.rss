    <title>Can I hack like in World of Warcraft?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-i-hack-like-in-world-of-warcraft/108480</link>
    <description>When you use Cheatengine you can boost the speed and it accually works in WoW most likely cause character location is client side. So my question is, is it possible to change the location of your character like when i hack WoW? I think there might be a difference of able and not able becuase RS is block based and WoW is free form.

Just wondering...</description>

              <p>I think It’s better to have a mediocre, half-way unprotected game. there is more hacking possibilities.<br>
Here’s one example: I made a hack for that game that makes you attack like…</p>
<p>boom.boom.boom.boom.boom    opposed to:</p>
<p>boom…boom…boom…boom…boom…boom</p>
<p>When its ussually protected by clientside. of course you have to be speeding with something like cheat engine.</p>
<p>usually when you attack when speeding you stop after one hit. with the hack you don’t so… its good. xD</p>

Actually. In some games it is possible. there is something called wpe pro. it records packets of information that are being recieved by the Client From the server, and sent from the client to the server. There is this game called endless online (eo).</p>
<p>In eo there are different maps, when I say maps, I dont mean like rs, where its just one big piece of land, and you have to load them seperately… each one is an individual, unequal area of terrain. anyways, you go to wpe pro select process endless.exe Start recording packets walk through a door, stop recording, look for a certain packet that was sent, play that packet every 100ms for 10 times…</p>
<p>Then you warp to the place you were supposed to when you walk through that certain door.</p>
<p>This is fun to make people say “wow, how is he doing that, HES SO COOL!”</p>
<p>I’m not sure if it would be possible for WOW, But I’m pretty sure that it might work for RS (When you walk up ladders and down ladders, or stairs OR EVEN IF YOUR Mining ESS (Record teleportation).</p>
<p>Major Downside: Packets last Abot 3 or so minutes =(</p>
<p>UpSide: D3WD… UR TELEPORTING!!</p>
<p>I’ll try using wpe pro with rs in a second.</p>
<p>I just thought of something else: record dancing. YAY<br>

<p>That wouldn’t work on RS. This “EO” must have some pretty mediocre developers.[/quote]</p>

No, character movement/pathing is server-side.<br>
[/quote]i’d have expected more from you :&lt;[/quote]If you send a path but a direct point to point where it isn’t possible, the server won’t obey. Creation of path may be clientside, but this is probably a scaling thing than anything else, pathing still exists on the server.</p>

</aside>
<p>WRONG.</p>
<p>Character movement is server-side.</p>
<p>Pathing is clientside; the server just checks the next tile that the client sends the walk command to, and either decides in favor or otherwise to move to hte next tile.</p>

              <p>When you use Cheatengine you can boost the speed and it accually works in WoW most likely cause character location is client side. So my question is, is it possible to change the location of your character like when i hack WoW? I think there might be a difference of able and not able becuase RS is block based and WoW is free form.</p>
<p>Just wondering…</p>
