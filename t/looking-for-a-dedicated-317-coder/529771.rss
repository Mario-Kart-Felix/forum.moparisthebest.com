    <title>Looking for a Dedicated 317 Coder</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-dedicated-317-coder/529771</link>
    <description>My server has a decent player average and a fun community, the server started yesterday. I code alot of features but unfortunately, school has started for me. I will no longer be able to code on weekdays anymore. Only weekends, in which I dedicate alot of time. I am looking for a very experienced coder who can code my 317 pi based server and provide daily updates to entertain the players. I pay for the VPS and Webhost costs, so dont worry about paying anything.

 I am looking for:
 Someone Creative
 Someone who knows how to control a smooth Economy (The server runs on an economy, dont code things that would damage it, my players like a challenge)
 Someone who has Experience
 Someone who is Friendly and Mature
 Someone who can provide Daily Updates
 Someone who is Devoted to the Server

 If you think you fill these needs, contact me on skype: mabrox97
 We will have a nice chat, I like to be on a personal level with my staff members to get a good friendly vibe going. Impress me, if you have previous works, show me. Pictures and videos help.

 Thanks and hope to meet great people!</description>
