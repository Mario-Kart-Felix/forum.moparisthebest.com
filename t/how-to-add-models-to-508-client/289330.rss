    <title>How to add models to 508 client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-add-models-to-508-client/289330</link>
    <description>I know how to add models and such for 317&#39;s clients and yeah but 508&#39;s seem to be a lot different. I&#39;m trying something new and I need a bit of help, so if anyone has a link to a guide please post here. I tried searching for the topics but couldn&#39;t find any. 


If you don&#39;t have a link you don&#39;t have anything useful to say please don&#39;t post things like. Use the search button... Because I already did.</description>
