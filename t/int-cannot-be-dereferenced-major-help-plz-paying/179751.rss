    <description>Ok, 

So i need when playerX with id 1 has attacked playerY with id 2
and then in process it needs to check if playerY is still drunk or something else

so i need something like this
in attack case: test == plz.playerId
then in process it needs to check if the attacked player is drunk
if(timer == 0 &amp;&amp; test.stilldrunk) {
blalbla
}

so if the playerX attacks the playerY.
Then playerX stops attacking and then it needs to check if playerY is drunken

it gives me errors because it cannot be :
&quot;int cannot be dereferenced&quot;

is there a way to fix it?
i pay via paypal $5 if you help me or an good rs account
