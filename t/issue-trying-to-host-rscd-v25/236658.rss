    <title>Issue trying to host RSCD v25</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/issue-trying-to-host-rscd-v25/236658</link>
    <description>I have been able to easily host demonik&#39;s and other servers, but RSCD v25 is a bit of a pickle.
Error I get is:
[code]
Buildfile: build.xml

runls:
     [java] Login Server starting up...
     [java] Connected to MySQL
     [java] LoginEngine now running

     [java] Java Result: 1

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 0 seconds
Press any key to continue . . .[/code]
Now, there are NONE java.exe processes in my task manager processes menu, and I certainly have all ports opened (8181, 34522, 43594).
I also have MSN and WAMP running.
What could be the problem? I could read from that error that any of those ports was in use but I tried changing them (to a random nr, like 19948), but still, got the same error.
All the IPs in ls.conf and world.xml are my own ip&#39;s (from www.whatismyip.com), in conf.xml(at conf\server\conf.xml) I have both ips set on localhost. Even when I set ALL ips in all config files into my whatismyip.com address, I still get that error.

So, any help probably?</description>

<p>Anyways: try restarting your computer and see if that works, or try setting all the ips to localhost. Also make sure that you don’t have any java.exe processes running, even though you said you don’t, check again because you might of not seen one that is running.</p>
