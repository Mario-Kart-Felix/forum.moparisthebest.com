Craftscape is going to be a huge compatible rsps to play available for free online,with monsters to kill,quests to complete, and mythical dungeon groundshaking beasts awaiting for you to explore and slay.Gain your&#39;e combat level and skill levels to gain experience to become the top ranked fighter in Craftscape.It is a never ending online adventure celebrating your&#39;e needs for what gaming experience you have all been waiting for.

[size=14pt][b]Craftscape Customs[/b][/size]
Craftscape will have no customs such as dragon claws, 3rd age, Pvp Armours.It will be kept to the old school standard such as Rune armour, Defenders, whips,dds etc.Old wilderness i believe is an alltime favourite to my likeing and im sure its youre&#39;s to!

Your&#39;e current start level will be 3 but dont worry you can quickly gain levels due to x5 runescape combat xp which is pretty quick but also challengable which i prefer.You will start in lumbridge once you have gone through your tutorials with the Lumbridge city guide if your forget things dont worry you will be left with one of his many starter books.
Once you get better you will be wanting to fight harder and pk harder to become reputated meaning popular throughout the game to become well known!All correct food works which you can fish for all over Craftscape, craft magical potions to gain your chance of better levels and to recover or drink for prayer stability!
Weapon specials are perfect timeing such as dds has correct hits, dragon scim and whip also.

[size=14pt][b]Client Features[/b][/size]
The client has an oldschool game frame with prayers working up to level 52 (smite) so set your boundries with this oldschool empire 317 gameplay of craftscape ultimate codeing facility.It has a huge domination of old school gameplay with skulls working, npc interfaces, client interfaces, sound features and old runescape music!
