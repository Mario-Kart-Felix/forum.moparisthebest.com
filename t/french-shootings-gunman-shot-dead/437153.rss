    <title>French Shootings - Gunman shot dead</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/french-shootings-gunman-shot-dead/437153</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;A police siege in the French city of Toulouse has ended with a man suspected of killing seven people now dead, sources tell French media, although there is no official confirmation yet.

Police had entered the flat where Mohammed Merah was holed up after a siege that lasted more than a day.

Police sources told AFP that three officers had been wounded, one seriously, in the assault.

Merah, 23, was suspected of killing seven people in three separate attacks.

Earlier Interior Minister Claude Gueant said Merah had wanted to die &quot;with weapons in hand&quot; and there had been no contact with him overnight.

Before the assault took place, Mr Gueant said it was unclear whether Merah was still alive.

However, police met resistance as they began the assault shortly after 09:30 GMT.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Looks like the French police lost their patience and stormed his flat.</description>

<p>I’m sure the gun(s) were illegal.  That is one of my points, there is no way to pass laws to keep criminals from getting ahold of illegal guns, if criminals obeyed laws, they wouldn’t be criminals.  And that is what the whole concept of gun-control is based around.</p>

<p>Also, I’d like to address a possible inconsistency in the article:</p>
<blockquote>Mr Molins said a Colt 45 handgun was found next to his body, and he estimated that Merah had fired 30 bullets as the commandos broke in.</blockquote>
A standard Colt 1911 .45ACP magazine holds 7 rounds, you can buy them that hold 8 rounds though, so even with the best case scenario, that guy went through 3-4 magazine reloads WHILE the commandos were breaking in?  It must have been the slowest break in ever.  I doubt that this was possible.

<p>Yea, no. His goal was to kill these people, so he met the soldiers and shot them. I doubt they had time to pull out a gun. Same with the shooting at the school. He came, he fired his gun, and scooted away.</p>
