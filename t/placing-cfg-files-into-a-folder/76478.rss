    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/placing-cfg-files-into-a-folder/76478</link>
    <description>*****************
EDit: I have already found out what to do.
i need to look into each .java file i got that are related to the cfg files and
change there paths.. 
*****************

What do i have to edit in my client.java to be able to put my cfg files into folders?

now all my cgf files are in the same folder as all my other files.
But i want them to be in seperate folders.

like 
Speed-pk (source folder)
Speed-pk -&gt; config -&gt; (cfg&#39;s here)

well actualy i want to make 
Speed-pk -&gt; Config -&gt; Shops -&gt; Shops.cfg
Speed-pk -&gt; Config -&gt; NPc -&gt; Spawns.cfg

And so on and so on....

Can anyone help me on this ?
i am using a spartanScape source that was made with mod taharoks Source builder.</description>
