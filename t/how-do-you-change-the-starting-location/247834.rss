              <p>Ok, go into your Player.java and search either the X or Y coordinate of your current starting location.</p>
<p>Then, just change both of them to what you want the new location to start off. Don’t forget you need to keep searching again, because most most likely your source has it when they die, they go to that location too. You have to change that one aswell, just keep searching for the current X or Y coordinate until there isn’t any more to find.</p>
