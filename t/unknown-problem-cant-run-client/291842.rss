    <title>Unknown problem? cant run client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unknown-problem-cant-run-client/291842</link>
    <description>ok so basically when i load a client from a downloaded source i got off this website its saying &quot;client is already in use&quot; on the batch file,
which means its open somewhere else? even though ive looked through task manager and ended all batch files secondly used another compiler for the server source i chose which seems to be working fine now but my freind who took a look on teamviewer couldnt find exactly the problem but said somehow it could be to do with my port? ill try add more to this if i find more info. but please try and help as much as you can. also i just want a 317 for me to personally roam and code to gain some more coding experience. i followed soeones thread about portforwarding using torrent which i followed but im not sure if im portforwarded also if any1 works this out and cna port me forward can be considered pro because ive had a few people take alook at this. pm me on here, ask for my msn or vent if your willing to help or post.</description>
