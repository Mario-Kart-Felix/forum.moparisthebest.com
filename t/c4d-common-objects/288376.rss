    <description>Hello c4d users,

I&#39;ve been looking at the rooms and very complex projects some of you have made. What I am wondering is, for example, in a room I need a couch; do I make a complete new one for each project I do?

Is there somewhere to download simple objects or would anyone be willing to share some?

I need a simple scene but I&#39;m not good enough to make most of the stuff I need :)


Also off topic, anyone think r11 is better or does everybody still use 10.5</description>

              <p>Frell has a nice point, when I’m working on huge things I do that sometimes too. That way you don’t get lost in the: well, it could use a little more but from the camera view and since it’s behind something, it’ll be fine.</p>
<p>That’ll also teach you pipelining, and faster ways of production once you get everything organized.</p>

              <p>I find it easier to make a couch in a brand new project, so i focus just on that couch. Then i save it and use it in whatever scene requires a couch. Same with tables, chairs, lamps. etc.</p>

              <p>No reason why R11 wouldn’t be better.</p>
<p>You do not need to make a couch for each time you make a living room, as long as you don’t mind having the same couch in every living room, but what’s the learning in that?</p>
<p>You can google simple objects, but again, what’s the learning in that?</p>
<p>And the simple objects you google will all be pretty much crap. Something you could do in no time at all and have it look better. People who can do nice models want to make money for it, and therefore if you want anything that looks any good, you will have to pay for it.</p>
<p>And it’s not like you can torrent them either. Some huge collective packages you can, but if you see a nice chair from Mr. Ed Sanders for sale, you’re not going to go find a torrent for Ed Sander’s stuff. It’s not a big area of piracy.</p>
<p>You’re better off learning and making your own models. You can save them and keep them for future projects.</p>
<p>Besides, we’ll all laugh at you if you download a few models and put them together in a scene with no composition and barely any work done by you.</p>
