    <description>Ok so I am remaking castle wars from scratch and it seems the only part I am stuck on is where a team cape is given to the player. What I mean by this is, lets say a player picks saradomin for a team. You go into the saradomin portal and the saradomin cloak gets equipped to the player and the player cannot take it off, I am looking for a code to do this. I have ben searching all over for this code, I&#39;ve also tried ripping it from multiple castle wars mingames and i&#39;ve come up with nothing... I&#39;ve tried scripting my own code for this and it didn&#39;t work either, so please help.</description>

              <p>I do not understand that bit of code you posted at all, if I wanted an item added to the player id have it added like this<br>
c.getItems().addItem(10010, 1);</p>
<p>but what I am looking for is where the item is equipped to the player and the player cannot take it off.<br>
That is the bit of coding I am looking for. Still in need of help so please do.</p>
