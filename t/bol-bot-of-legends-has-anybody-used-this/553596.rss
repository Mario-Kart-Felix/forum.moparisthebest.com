    <title>BoL (Bot of Legends) - Has anybody used this?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bol-bot-of-legends-has-anybody-used-this/553596</link>
    <description>What the title says. I&#39;ve seen videos and pictures providing proof of people going from unranked to master without next to no experience of the game.

 I was unaware of a bot so significant. They literally have bots which all you do is hold &quot;space&quot; and it literally farms for you. It shows when somebody is ganking, when somebody is doing drake etc, when somebody is recalling, it dodges almost all skillshots with its unhuman-like reflexes and it does combos for you, I must remind you this is all by just pressing 1 button...

Anybody used this and is it safe?</description>

<p>Probably hasn’t been researched enough by anyone here to know what algorithms they have for detecting cheating. Changing the speed of the bot likely isn’t that protective, that’s like saying you’ve got Jagex tricked by changing the interval on an auto-clicker. I’m sure they have much more protection than that. You could probably go awhile before getting caught since Riot tends to ban people in waves.</p>

              <p>BoL impresses me because of how well some of their scripts work. Its incredibly efficient. But I dont see a point in it. Most of the time people are limited by their game knowledge not how well they can play.</p>

              <p>You will likely get banned sooner or later, Rito is in a pretty good position with detecting cheated accounts. I’m not saying they do this, but I’m sure they have watches on accounts that gain MMR abnormally fast.</p>
<p>These bots are real, most people afaik use them for the reaction speed - either to react to an enemy’s abilities or to perform combos faster than they normally can.</p>
<p>I realize I’m posting this on a cheating forum - but what’s the point in cheating in LoL? Isn’t the point of a strategy game to improve?</p>

              <p>[quote=“WarTusk-RSPS, post:2, topic:553596”]Completely safe[/quote]Not true at all. There were ban waves a couple months ago and thousands of accounts were perm banned. They keep a list and do it in waves so that people don’t know when they are being detected.</p>
<p>There are also plenty of easy ways to tell when someone is botting in-game and you can report them and they will get added to the list.</p>
<p>Use at your own risk. If you want to bot, go ahead, but if you bitch about getting banned you’re gunna get laughed at.</p>
