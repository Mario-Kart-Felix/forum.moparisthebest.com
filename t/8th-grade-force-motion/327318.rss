    <description>omg help please:(
also what do you think about taking IPC freshman year then bilogy 2nd year?
and what other science classes should i take

RETEACH: Chapter 3 (Section 1)
1. Describe how we know an object is in motion.

2. How can the potential energy of a boulder resting on a hillside be converted into kinetic energy?

3. Your friend kicks a soccer ball toward you, but the ball stops before it reaches you. Your friend says
that Newton&#39;s first law must be wrong because the ball should have kept moving at a constant speed.
How would you explain to your friend that the ball stopping demonstrates that Newton&#39;s first law is
correct?

4. How does Newton&#39;s second law explain why it is easier to push a bicycle to give it a certain
acceleration than to push a car to give it the same acceleration?

5. Suppose you are standing on a skateboard or on in-line skates and you toss a backpack full of heavy
books toward your friend. What do you think will happen to you, and why? Explain your answer in
terms of Newton&#39;s third law of motion.</description>

<li>objects have a tendency to stay in the same state of motion. the soccer ball, as accordingly, has this tendency; however, the gravitational force, and, as a result, rolling friction (the ball is pulled towards the ground, causing the rubbing and continuous deformation of the ball which results in loss of energy), are outside forces that hinder the motion of the ball.</li>

<li>forces come in pairs of action and reaction forces. in this case, the action force is to push the backpack. when doing so, however, the backpack exerts an equal and opposite force (F[sub]1[/sub] = -F[sub]2[/sub]) on you. normally, nothing would happen due to the friction with the ground; however, using a skateboard or pair of skates (glorified wheel-and-axle), the force is pushed over a longer distance, and rolling friction is also less than the normal friction - thus, you can actually notice the reaction force, and, therefore, roll backwards.</li>

              <blockquote>uhh friction is the more valid answer</blockquote>
<p>Both gravity and friction are forces which thwart the motion of the soccer ball, so gravity could be part of a valid answer as well as friction. The question asks us to explain how Newtons first law is proved by the failure of the ball to keep moving. The ball would have continued forever until it hit the observer in the face and fucked his shit up, according to the first part of the law however the forces which hindered the balls movement (gravity, etc…) were greater than the balls inertia so the ball stopped; according to the second part of the law. In this case, the person kicking the ball should work out more and then instead of asking questions he could hit people in the face with his balls, besides he’s an imaginary character and doesn’t even have the right to engage in the Socratic method anyway.</p>
<blockquote>1. the position is changing over time--precisely-correct answer</blockquote>
<p>That is a tautology, it doesn’t describe how you know the object is in motion. You have in fact described  motion more fully than necessary without describing your method for knowing that motions is a quality of the object in question. One can have motion without applying the concept of location, and time is not the only way to quantify motion. To correctly answer the question, which asks how we know, not what we know, we must qualify the method of how we achieved the knowledge of the objects motion, which was accomplished through empirical reasoning.</p>

              <p>omg help please:(<br>
also what do you think about taking IPC freshman year then bilogy 2nd year?<br>
and what other science classes should i take</p>
<p>RETEACH: Chapter 3 (Section 1)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Describe how we know an object is in motion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can the potential energy of a boulder resting on a hillside be converted into kinetic energy?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your friend kicks a soccer ball toward you, but the ball stops before it reaches you. Your friend says<br>
that Newton’s first law must be wrong because the ball should have kept moving at a constant speed.<br>
How would you explain to your friend that the ball stopping demonstrates that Newton’s first law is<br>
correct?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does Newton’s second law explain why it is easier to push a bicycle to give it a certain<br>
acceleration than to push a car to give it the same acceleration?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suppose you are standing on a skateboard or on in-line skates and you toss a backpack full of heavy<br>
books toward your friend. What do you think will happen to you, and why? Explain your answer in<br>
terms of Newton’s third law of motion.</p>
