    <title>PC crash prevention</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pc-crash-prevention/238301</link>
    <description>Just a few moments ago my laptop crashed because it sucks dick and I overloaded it. I was downloading, playing some music and when I tried to save some homework I made in Excel it crashed. I do realise that it&#39;s partially because Vista is cock.

So I was thinking, isn&#39;t it possible to prevent the user from overloading that what&#39;s being overloaded? I mean, the kernel assigns memory and cpu usage to all the applications right? So if it senses that it has to assign more then it can assign, it should make somekind of que. 

Most businesses work like that, if they have to produce more then their capacity, they either cancel orders or put yours on a waiting list. If a company doesnt do that it gets angry customers, just like I am angry because the fucking thing crashed.

So, am I asking/expecting too much, or am I a genius for coming up with something? [size=1pt](I think it&#39;s the first option) It&#39;s possible that this post consists of nothing but bullshit. If true, my apology&#39;s.[/size]</description>

No, just alot of people bitch for no reason and usually it’s their fault. I have vista for 1.5 years + and nothing bad has happen. All my games work fine except RTW witch dosen’t work.</p>

<p>I have had 2 crashes with Vista (I’ve had Vista for a year and a half), both were because my PSU wattage is to low to support my GFX card.<br>
So, it’s not Vista. GTFO of the bandwagon.</p>

              <p>Well, in Linux, if the application makes a memory allocation request greater than that which the system can fulfill, it dies with a segmentation fault (SIGSEG). I would assume Windows should have something like that, and I doubt running low on memory was your issue (Windows also tries to expand the pagefile to accommodate memory requests when running low on memory, virtual or otherwise), your processor probably started to overheat so your motherboard shut your computer down or something of the sort to protect it.</p>
