    <title>Half of a chest DISAPPEARED</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/half-of-a-chest-disappeared/407155</link>
    <description>Hi, i come here with a weird issue: i was going to retrieve some bricks from my chest in my home, when i look that half of my large chest disappeared, with many items inside (blocks of diamonds, gold, bricks, saddles, cocoa beans, and more). I used bb log and there&#39;s no information about the dissapearance, no one destroyed it, nor user or the enviroment itself. I came here because i had a lot of valuable things in that chest, and i wanted to ask the Admins if they can check my problem, and if possible; give me my stuff back. Anyone had experienced this before? Cheers and thank you! [img]http://oi54.tinypic.com/mrsj0x.jpg[/img]</description>
