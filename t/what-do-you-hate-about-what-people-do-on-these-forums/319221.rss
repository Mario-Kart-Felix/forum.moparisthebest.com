    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-do-you-hate-about-what-people-do-on-these-forums/319221</link>
    <description>I hate when kids put in there signature, &quot;omgg!1 i was warned.. y i only posted 16 topics about my gay deltascape source!!&quot;
I also hate when you&#39;re trying to help someone, they start to get upset because nothing you&#39;re suggesting is working.
And, I hate when kids make smfforfree forums. Seriously? YOU CANT FUCKING DOWNLOAD AN ARCHIVE AND UPLOAD IT TO A FREE WEBHOSTING SERVICE?!

What about you?
I know there was a topic, though it is completely inactive and I don&#39;t want to bump it.</description>

              <p>I hate when kids put in there signature, “omgg!1 i was warned… y i only posted 16 topics about my gay deltascape source!!”<br>
I also hate when you’re trying to help someone, they start to get upset because nothing you’re suggesting is working.<br>
And, I hate when kids make smfforfree forums. Seriously? YOU CANT FUCKING DOWNLOAD AN ARCHIVE AND UPLOAD IT TO A FREE WEBHOSTING SERVICE?!</p>
<p>What about you?<br>
I know there was a topic, though it is completely inactive and I don’t want to bump it.</p>
