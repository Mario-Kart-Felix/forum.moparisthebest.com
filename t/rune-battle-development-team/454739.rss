[b]What is this &quot;Rune-Battle&quot;?[/b]

Server&#39;s Source is based off Rune-Legacy
The Main idea is to highly modify this and make it unique.

Rune-Battle is a runescape private server managed by Dalton aka Anthony, currently looking for professional Developer&#39;s who understand coding, and java. Rune-Battle source is based off Rune-Legacy, ive modified a few things, i found out that dragon claws are bugged, and need fixing. I fixed it client sided, the model wasn&#39;t working, so ive fixed it. What needs fixing is the special attack. I will be working on it later, as it is a minor bug. 

[b]Why are you working on this?[/b]

Im working on this because I would love to have a community running, this can be one of the greatest server&#39;s out there if effort and dedication is put in it. Im looking for Developers to help me code this, and when it is ready, it will be released to the public to be played. This isn&#39;t just going to be any simple runescape private server, its going to have great features and great content. We will be making sure that there are no bugs, to make the game play smooth and comfortably played.

[b]Management:[/b]

I will be managing the forums, while my Developer&#39;s will help with coding the server, I&#39;m going to start off with setting up a simple machines website, aka smf. Will be making it look like vbulletin, as I have a few vb themes that work with it. Later on, if we get donations we will become domained and possibly buy an official VB licence. I&#39;m currently running the server locally on Eclipse (An IDE). Helps me tons with the coding and if there any errors with the code it will notify me. 

[b]Goals?[/b]

My goals are to be able to make this one of the greatest servers out there, we will be doing our best with programming. All donations will go towards the server/website/hosting and more. We want our community to be active, not just any simple community, we want to have unique ingame features and content, so our players will enjoy the server. Also, in the future we want to part of the top 10 server&#39;s, as that will require alot of hard work.
