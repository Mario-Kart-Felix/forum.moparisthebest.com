    <title>Help with adding donor boxes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-adding-donor-boxes/459127</link>
    <description>Hello, I am using the source Eclipse 639, and i was wondering how i could add something like soulsplit has and make Donor Boxes and have you open it and receive like 10m coins (everytime) and a chance to receive other donor items like primal and stuff I know that there is already an item (6199) that is mystery box, how could I 1) Change the name to Donor box, (i have tried changing it everywhere i see the name that doesnt work) and what code would i use to insert the donor box? I will post any files requested needed to see, i also have skype if you could possibly add me on skype to help that would be great, thank you ~Hinaruti

Skype: leon.massimo

Edit: I will Rep++ anyone who helps me, even if I don&#39;t use the advice of it doesn&#39;t work. No random comments trying to get me to rep you, i will only rep certain people.

Edit: If there is a better source that is a lot easier to use I will try that, Eclipse was my first major project.</description>
