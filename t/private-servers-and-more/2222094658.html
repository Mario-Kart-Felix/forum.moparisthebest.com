Did you know that people that beleive in a god who can punish them is counter productive to a religeon? Because then its no longer about faith, its about fear. Religeous people fear their gods, and the bible states god created earth in 7 days, i think the earth created god in 7 days. Early humans, much like you, didn’t understand the world around them, they needed someone to blame for their shortfalls, wet seasons and mistakes. So they made a god, that is why there are multiple religons. Do you really beleive that if there was a true god he would want people believing in other sentient beings that don’t exist? Naturally a people beleive that heaven is in the clouds, if so god is being killed by humans as global warming erodes his palace. What about the rest of the univers if it took God that long to make earth how long must it have taken him to make the rest of the universe? Why does the bible not mention this? You mention Noah and the Ark right? Well he took 2 of every animal on the ark true? Well thats a load of bull what would they have eaten? The carnivores would have devoured the other animals, what would the people have eaten? There would be no room for herbs and plants so they would have to exterminate a few races. If only two of each species came on board all species would be inbreds the people would be inbreds after 2 generations mutations would occur does the bible mention that? NO. You should be more careful about the bible its a subject that ignites contraversy(spelt wrong i can’t rememeber how to spell it :D) in almost everyone. Did you know the bible was compiled 200 years after Jesus’ death? Did you know the gospels that showed jesus as a man were hidden from the bible? Did you know that there are no first hand accounts in any of the religous writings? Did you know the church are a monopolising organisation that used religeon as a way to swindle the public for cash? In fact the roman catholic church owns the worlds smallest country. Basically the church is big cover up for rich bastards who didn’t want to work for a living and used fear to get money from the public.[/quote]HAIL THE FREE WILL</p>
