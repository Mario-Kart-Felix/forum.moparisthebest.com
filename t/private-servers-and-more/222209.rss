    <title>Private Servers And More</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/private-servers-and-more/222209</link>
    <description>February 22, 2006 Mopar Forums were created and advertisement went all around. Soon the community became huge. People tried hacking/sending viruses and other things. The community soon collapsed and there was nothing but &quot;leecher&quot; and bad words that really weren&#39;t necessary. People started saying bad things because of what others made. Just because others had the same thing people would hate them saying leecher etc. Runescape had a big update on July 1st. The Runescape Private Server Communities went lower. Every day you went on Moparscape or Rune Server or any Private Server Community just remember it will always be the same and it will never become like runescape no matter what. Even if that&#39;s not why you join these communities they still will always be the same thing like New home area, New pk area, New minigame etc. Sometimes it&#39;s really fun to play but you get bored. Most things on these forums are hatred cussing and leeching. Over 75% Of these communities don&#39;t even know what God is or they are just so stupid they don&#39;t spend anytime with their family and stay on the computer all waiting for there life to go by and No God with them. Just the feeling when you go to confession it&#39;s a really nice feeling if only most of you knew. Go ahead and waste your time saying &quot;gtfo nub&quot; or &quot;cunt gay ass bitch&#39; those words all mean nothing as that is not what I am.

Oh and remember it&#39;s not late to quit these forums.

Find out more about God. If you think there is no God well there is.

The bible proves and talks about space how the world is round and so many other things I have no time to explain. Find out more about the bible and God. You&#39;ll soon believe. I hope you enjoy your lifes. I am sure no one back then got to go to space. Also people found the ark that Noah made in china. Communists wouldnt let all go and see it... LEARN WAY MORE.

DId you know? Over half of a science book holds lies? That is true to.

              <p>[quote=“sanga282, post:3, topic:222209”]Did you know 80% of the bible is contradictory towards itself, and also contains more lies than you do? And i don’t know what science books you’ve been reading but the ones i read make perfect sense thank you very much.<br>
Did you know that people that beleive in a god who can punish them is counter productive to a religeon? Because then its no longer about faith, its about fear. Religeous people fear their gods, and the bible states god created earth in 7 days, i think the earth created god in 7 days. Early humans, much like you, didn’t understand the world around them, they needed someone to blame for their shortfalls, wet seasons and mistakes. So they made a god, that is why there are multiple religons. Do you really beleive that if there was a true god he would want people believing in other sentient beings that don’t exist? Naturally a people beleive that heaven is in the clouds, if so god is being killed by humans as global warming erodes his palace. What about the rest of the univers if it took God that long to make earth how long must it have taken him to make the rest of the universe? Why does the bible not mention this? You mention Noah and the Ark right? Well he took 2 of every animal on the ark true? Well thats a load of bull what would they have eaten? The carnivores would have devoured the other animals, what would the people have eaten? There would be no room for herbs and plants so they would have to exterminate a few races. If only two of each species came on board all species would be inbreds the people would be inbreds after 2 generations mutations would occur does the bible mention that? NO. You should be more careful about the bible its a subject that ignites contraversy(spelt wrong i can’t rememeber how to spell it :D) in almost everyone. Did you know the bible was compiled 200 years after Jesus’ death? Did you know the gospels that showed jesus as a man were hidden from the bible? Did you know that there are no first hand accounts in any of the religous writings? Did you know the church are a monopolising organisation that used religeon as a way to swindle the public for cash? In fact the roman catholic church owns the worlds smallest country. Basically the church is big cover up for rich bastards who didn’t want to work for a living and used fear to get money from the public.[/quote]HAIL THE FREE WILL</p>

People tried hacking/sending viruses and other things. The community soon collapsed and there was nothing but “leecher” and bad words that really weren’t necessary. People started saying bad things because of what others made. Just because others had the same thing people would hate them saying leecher etc. Runescape had a big update on July 1st. The Runescape Private Server Communities went lower. Every day you went on Moparscape or Rune Server or any Private Server Community just remember it will always be the same and it will never become like runescape no matter what. Even if that’s not why you join these communities they still will always be the same thing like New home area, New pk area, New minigame etc. Sometimes it’s really fun to play but you get bored. Most things on these forums are hatred cussing and leeching. Over 75% Of these communities don’t even know what God is or they are just so stupid they don’t spend anytime with their family and stay on the computer all waiting for there life to go by and No God with them. Just the feeling when you go to confession it’s a really nice feeling if only most of you knew. Go ahead and waste your time saying “gtfo nub” or "cunt gay ass bitch’ those words all mean nothing as that is not what I am.</p>
<p>Oh and remember it’s not late to quit these forums.</p>
<p>Find out more about God. If you think there is no God well there is.</p>
<p>The bible proves and talks about space how the world is round and so many other things I have no time to explain. Find out more about the bible and God. You’ll soon believe. I hope you enjoy your lifes. I am sure no one back then got to go to space. Also people found the ark that Noah made in china. Communists wouldnt let all go and see it… LEARN WAY MORE.</p>

              <p>Did you know 80% of the bible is contradictory towards itself, and also contains more lies than you do? And i don’t know what science books you’ve been reading but the ones i read make perfect sense thank you very much.<br>
Did you know that people that beleive in a god who can punish them is counter productive to a religeon? Because then its no longer about faith, its about fear. Religeous people fear their gods, and the bible states god created earth in 7 days, i think the earth created god in 7 days. Early humans, much like you, didn’t understand the world around them, they needed someone to blame for their shortfalls, wet seasons and mistakes. So they made a god, that is why there are multiple religons. Do you really beleive that if there was a true god he would want people believing in other sentient beings that don’t exist? Naturally a people beleive that heaven is in the clouds, if so god is being killed by humans as global warming erodes his palace. What about the rest of the univers if it took God that long to make earth how long must it have taken him to make the rest of the universe? Why does the bible not mention this? You mention Noah and the Ark right? Well he took 2 of every animal on the ark true? Well thats a load of bull what would they have eaten? The carnivores would have devoured the other animals, what would the people have eaten? There would be no room for herbs and plants so they would have to exterminate a few races. If only two of each species came on board all species would be inbreds the people would be inbreds after 2 generations mutations would occur does the bible mention that? NO. You should be more careful about the bible its a subject that ignites contraversy(spelt wrong i can’t rememeber how to spell it :D) in almost everyone. Did you know the bible was compiled 200 years after Jesus’ death? Did you know the gospels that showed jesus as a man were hidden from the bible? Did you know that there are no first hand accounts in any of the religous writings? Did you know the church are a monopolising organisation that used religeon as a way to swindle the public for cash? In fact the roman catholic church owns the worlds smallest country. Basically the church is big cover up for rich bastards who didn’t want to work for a living and used fear to get money from the public.</p>
