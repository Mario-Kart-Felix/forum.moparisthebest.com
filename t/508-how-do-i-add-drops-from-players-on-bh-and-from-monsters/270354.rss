    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-how-do-i-add-drops-from-players-on-bh-and-from-monsters/270354</link>
    <description>If anyone could help... People really like the server but the only problem is that there&#39;s no drops on BH (so we kill each other with 3+ items and we get nothing) and monsters dont drop anything.. I would be pleased if anyone could help me ;)</description>
