    <title>Views on Eco Resets?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/views-on-eco-resets/526303</link>
    <description>I posted something awhile back giving my new idea of how a eco reset should work since recently a private server, *cough*vicious Revolution*cough* had a eco reset and lost half of its player count then the co-owner left.   The server went great for a awhile then players started quieting since we started getting ppl quieting 1 by 1.  Then staff members started quieting because the other co-owner just left and said he was coming back,but never did...and still hasn&#39;t responded on the forums...its been 3 weeks or more since last word from him.  Now the co-owner that left, came back to help out, but when I login I don&#39;t see a single staff member online with only one player online, what a trooper, and me, but I just pop in to check and see if the server is coming back.  

[u][i][b]So can a Eco Reset do this much damage to a server?[/b][/i][/u]  A server that had 30+ player then went down to 20+ and now its only 1 if you are loged in.  I told them to shutdown the server until they get this under control, but they say they are fine when that other co-owner comes back.  Atm two old staff members, left the server due to the co-owners absence, have now created another server which is Vitrium, sorry but im not advertising that has 18+ players a day which is way better then the old server in player count. 

[size=14pt][b][i][u]So Does a Eco Reset lead to theses events often?[/u][/i][/b][/size]  I think a eco reset is pointless unless your economy is so bad, but a eco reset is unnecessary since you should be able to fix it as fast as you can.  Plus I believe that the communication between staff members lead to this since now I see only 2 staff members do work, but now they feel like there&#39;s no pointless since the owner is not online, the one that hasn&#39;t showed up.


So to answer my view on eco resets is that they must be used by knowing the effects.  Most people left because of the time they spent on the skills which they lost all that time and plus donations where not refunded to their new accounts. 


What are your thoughts on this servers downfall and what is your view on Eco Resets? 
Plus did RuneScape ever have a eco reset?  And if not why do private servers have them?</description>

<li>Make a “trader” who just coincidentally is looking for that particular used to be rare product!</li>
<li>Change the drop so for a couple of months that product isn’t changed</li>
<li>This is something I am literally ALWAYS telling owners and they just don’t listen. Don’t keep the same drops/shops all the time. It makes it so people can buy stuff at any time. Set up rotation shops. That can change weekly, bi weekly, monthly, and so forth.</li>

<p>As more people quit from boredom the more new people will come in which will keep products overall rare.</p>

<p>I found all their mule accounts linked via IP (they thought they were clever spreading it across 6-7 accounts), and I had to remove over 8B in coins and billions of raw materials.</p>
<p>I eventually found out how the dupe was caused, fixed it and removed the masses of items. There may have been a few million that slipped through the net but I was able to restore the economy to it’s original state and not piss off any legit players.</p>

<p>Well, Jagex has rolled back(not fully reset, but it’s the same concept) due to people unfairly gaining items, and other various bad things.</p>
<p>That being said, everyone makes mistakes. It doesn’t necessary mean their server is programmed badly.[/quote]jagex used to rolled back stats on accounts that were botted (and wealth that was gained from botting)<br>
only time jagex ever rolls back accounts now is when there is some type of glitch that allows mass obtaining of new/rare items or massive amounts of cash (example being the crucible glitch with max cash)</p>
<p>this is all because the system was programmed incorrectly, which is a direct mistake of administration. (everyone makes mistakes though.)</p>

<p>if you’re going to dream for a economically stable server, spend time putting flags on your players and items before you even allow the server to be played.</p>
<p>monitor all new released bosses, systems, games, items, etc. record anyone who interacts with these systems. record anyone who touches these items. and if an item in spawned into the game, give that item a new config so every player can see it was spawned.</p>
<p>develop a static economy where prices change depending on the quantity of the items in the game.</p>
<p>there is never a need to reset an economy unless you have horrible systems added (easy to kill bosses + common drops on expensive items, dupes, packet spoofs for non validated data, etc.)<br>
if you ever feel like you need an economy reset because it’s bad. don’t worry about it, because you don’t have an economy present.</p>

<p>Well, Jagex has rolled back(not fully reset, but it’s the same concept) due to people unfairly gaining items, and other various bad things.</p>
<p>That being said, everyone makes mistakes. It doesn’t necessary mean their server is programmed badly.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>I posted something awhile back giving my new idea of how a eco reset should work since recently a private server, <em>cough</em>vicious Revolution<em>cough</em> had a eco reset and lost half of its player count then the co-owner left.   The server went great for a awhile then players started quieting since we started getting ppl quieting 1 by 1.  Then staff members started quieting because the other co-owner just left and said he was coming back,but never did…and still hasn’t responded on the forums…its been 3 weeks or more since last word from him.  Now the co-owner that left, came back to help out, but when I login I don’t see a single staff member online with only one player online, what a trooper, and me, but I just pop in to check and see if the server is coming back.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">So can a Eco Reset do this much damage to a server?</span></span></span>  A server that had 30+ player then went down to 20+ and now its only 1 if you are loged in.  I told them to shutdown the server until they get this under control, but they say they are fine when that other co-owner comes back.  Atm two old staff members, left the server due to the co-owners absence, have now created another server which is Vitrium, sorry but im not advertising that has 18+ players a day which is way better then the old server in player count.</p>
<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-u">So Does a Eco Reset lead to theses events often?</span></span></span>[/size]  I think a eco reset is pointless unless your economy is so bad, but a eco reset is unnecessary since you should be able to fix it as fast as you can.  Plus I believe that the communication between staff members lead to this since now I see only 2 staff members do work, but now they feel like there’s no pointless since the owner is not online, the one that hasn’t showed up.</p>
<p>So to answer my view on eco resets is that they must be used by knowing the effects.  Most people left because of the time they spent on the skills which they lost all that time and plus donations where not refunded to their new accounts.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this servers downfall and what is your view on Eco Resets?<br>
Plus did RuneScape ever have a eco reset?  And if not why do private servers have them?</p>
