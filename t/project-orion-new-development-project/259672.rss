    <title>Project Orion - New Development Project</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-orion-new-development-project/259672</link>
    <description>Well, I have started a new project after around 4 months of inactivity. This will be hosted 24/7 on a VPS once completed, but for now I want to see what you as a community would enjoy the most. The options are above and you may vote, change your vote, or look at what others picked. Please choose wisely as you will be deciding what goes into the source first. Eventually it will most likely have all of it, but whatever is chosen will be my primary and central focus.

Also, if you would mind, please include other options in your post such as:
- New areas you would want to be used/seen.
- A ny special attacks you would like me to focus on?
- Would you like to see mage autocasting?
- What minigames do you most enjoy and would like to see perfected?
- What monsters do you like to kill the most and would like to see perfected?
- Would you prefer old wilderness, or a pvp world kind of thing in certain areas?
- Would you want an easy leveling system or one that is a challenge?
- Do you want easy cash, or a stable economy with good trading?
- What skills would you like to see perfected and used within the server?

Please answer any of those you feel important enough to have in your reply and I will try to get back to you with an answer and start back working on the server again soon. Please vote. :)</description>
