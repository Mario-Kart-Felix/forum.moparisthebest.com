              <p>When I search in the Rsinterface i found this:<br>
}<br>
if(rsInterface.interfaceType == 4) {<br>
rsInterface.disabledMessage = stream.readString().replaceAll(“RuneScape”, “Intdubpk”);<br>
rsInterface.enabledMessage = stream.readString();</p>
<p>I have never seen this before and I do not know what to change, it is different from other banks I have changed.</p>
