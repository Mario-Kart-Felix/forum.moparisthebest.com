[i]This is going to be a early realase as i am thinking about not continuing with Project Enra PVP. There is no training in this as i&#39;ve never got around to edit. Deleted deltas. Just use ::master. Great server if you want to start PVP. The server also has PVPoints, and its PKPoints. Use it to buy from the PVP shop.[/i]
Base: Deltascape Cleaned
[i]Works with Bluurrs or any other client.[/i]
