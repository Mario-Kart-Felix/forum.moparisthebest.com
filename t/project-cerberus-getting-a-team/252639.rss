    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-cerberus-getting-a-team/252639</link>
    <description>Hello there, i&#39;ve started coding a source recently, and it looks too good for releasing.
So far it&#39;s got full herblore with potions that you drink and then drain. Full runecrafting with rune essence and altars, and
much much more. Such as full moving npc&#39;s. Good drops, and more..
I&#39;m looking for a server programmer to program with me.. (Must be amazing, mainly client work.)
A client programmer.
A site programmer.
Please add my msn hani-rules@hotmail.co.uk
For applications..
(Do not make an application if you can&#39;t code well, our programmers must be well established, able to code from scratch,
and to make complex codes.)</description>
