    <title>People don&#39;t load anything when they run my client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/people-dont-load-anything-when-they-run-my-client/546019</link>
    <description>Ok so, I have finished everything up to the point when people run my client. I have portforwarded I know because I used canyouseeme and I use an rsps server checker and it said it was online, I have my public client set to my no-ip address but no one can connect but when I use the no ip client it acts as if I use my local host client. What do I do to fix this?</description>

<p>I have done that, but it still will not load, I found “guardian” folders but that’s all I could find because I did what you said before you replied.</p>

Check your C:\ drive for the cache or your user home, which on windows 7 is C:\Users\YourComputerUsername\Cachename.<br>
That’s typically how I find it if I don’t know it.<br>
From there search the name in your client folder, and it should show all the files that have it’s name in it.<br>
Figure out which one has the method that returns the string with the cache name. Now you both know where the cache is so you can rename it, and you can also change the name of it for the client to load if you want. Just remember you have to change it in any file that doesn’t get the cache name from that method (you can always make it get it from that method)</p>

Anyways, it’s good to see it worked. Make sure the directory is not OS based.

I have found the Guardian718 folder which is the default name, then I found the user.home and I have changed the Guardian718 with my cache name, compiled it, ran it but it still loaded as Guardian718 instead of my cache name<br>
return System.getProperty(“user.home”) + “/Vileturmoilcache/guardian/live”;</p>

              <p>[quote=“sk8rdude461, post:2, topic:546019”]Rename your cache folder, where ever it’s located. Doesn’t matter what name.<br>
After you’ve renamed it, run the jar that you give to other people. Make sure to run it with a .bat (for debugging, yo).<br>

Do I change the cache name in the source folder or the data folder?</p>

              <p>Ok so, I have finished everything up to the point when people run my client. I have portforwarded I know because I used canyouseeme and I use an rsps server checker and it said it was online, I have my public client set to my no-ip address but no one can connect but when I use the no ip client it acts as if I use my local host client. What do I do to fix this?</p>
