    <title>Runescape 2008 remake? (Pre-hd updates)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-2008-remake-pre-hd-updates/480389</link>
    <description>2008 was one of the best years in Runescape, and I would love to see a remake of it. It had some of the best updates (Mostly summoning) and had a cool interface. Does anyone know of a 2008 remake? You know, one that doesn&#39;t have Edgeville spawn and 50x exp.

Sure, 2006 was fun, but it&#39;s getting old. Seeing as there is 10+ 2006 remakes out now, plus 2 being made every week.</description>

              <p>XenoRune 530. Is a good 2009 remake to start off with but the ammount of content needed to be added to it is too big. You will need to either give up on life or to have an army of developers</p>

<p>If it’s taking the best part of a year and a half~ to create a 2006 remake, how long do you think it’d take to create a 2008 remake? 2, 2 and a half, three years? No, there isn’t one yet. Mystic Floe was working on one but it appears to be abandoned.</p>
<p>Towards the 2006 remakes comment, out of the 10 apparent remakes you’ve named I can only name 2 that look like they’re going somewhere and one that’s already there so I now hand you the award for pulling numbers out your ass.[/quote]</p>
