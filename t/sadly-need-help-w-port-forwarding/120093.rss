    <title>Sadly Need Help w/ Port Forwarding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sadly-need-help-w-port-forwarding/120093</link>
    <description>Well Ive taken the tuts, ive done everything you could ever need to do for portforwarding .. I got the submask, ip, all the stuff .. now I have no idea what to do. Heres my problem.

I go to the default site that I [i]have[/i] to use. the site I have to use is 192.168.1.1 and when I go there I type in &quot;admin&quot; as user name and it keeps opening 3 times so I typed the same thing in the three boxes.

Then it went to this one site were it says &quot;404 Authorization Required&quot; So I said &quot;Eh, Must&#39;ve typed the pass and name in wrong&quot; So then I used admin as the pass. Still, The 404 Authorization Required page came up.

So, I used admin as the username and pass and still, the three boxes still came up. And of course, it went to the 404 Authorization Page. I then asked my parents if they had anything to do with the username and password. They had no idea, so then I tried searching my computor, and my router for the username and pass. I couldn&#39;t find anything.

Does anyone know where I can find the username and password? If it helps at all I have Linksys and my module type is WRT54G.

Thanks for reading,

              <p>go to <a href="http://portforward.com" rel="nofollow noopener">portforward.com</a> and click port forwarding on the upper left a little you will see than under that list find your router than under the next page go down the the Z’s i believe and click <a href="http://zbattle.net" rel="nofollow noopener">zbattle.net</a> and follow the steps in there it should work</p>
