    <title>Wanting To Get Involved</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wanting-to-get-involved/61613</link>
    <description>Sorry if I&#39;m not allowed to ask this here. 

Well, I&#39;m pretty nooby to Java, but I know my way about, and I&#39;d love to get involved in Runescape cheating. I was wondering whether anyone here that is pretty good with client hacking, could give me a sort of tutorial, or even help me about on MSN. 

I&#39;m not looking to do anything major, I&#39;m just looking to see whether I can get involved in cheating, and provide help and code to others when needed.

Thanks :)</description>

<p>So, I should use the Deob and learn my way around the client. Then maybe get involved in more advanced things.</p>

<p>Pretty much. My favorite way of doing it is to get an IDE with a good renaming refactor feature (like <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">IDEA</a>, my favorite, or <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Eclipse</a>) and start renaming things in the client as you discover what they do. The more stuff you rename, the clearer other things will become until you finally have a good idea of how most features work.</p>
<p>If you use someone else’s info to get started (like an old copy of Aryan or one of the “some info about #” posts) be sure that you understand what’s going on too and aren’t just copying the names. Granted, some stuff will be complicated at first and you might just want to skip those…it all depends on you.</p>

              <p>I’m not really up to providing a full tutorial on anything at the moment (I <span class="bbcode-i">still</span> intend to write some BCEL tutorials), but if you post questions someone will probably answer them (I’ll try to if no one else does).</p>
<p>Some getting-started links:</p>
<p>[ul][li]the automatic <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,7449.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">deobfuscator</a> that most people use to get source (but usually bots aren’t made from deobs)[/li]<br>
[li]a <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,86143.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">less detectable version</a> of the deobfuscator with some additional code-fixing features, but less automation[/li]<br>
[li]<a href="http://at2.runescape.com/runescape.jar" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">runescape.jar</a> (the client)[/li]<br>
[li]<a href="http://at2.runescape.com/loader.jar" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">loader.jar</a> (the game loader - not necessary for just trying stuff out, but you’ll want to start using it eventually to avoid detection)[/li]<br>
[li]the <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,86752.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">names and locations</a> of some useful variables in version 449 of the client (current as of writing afaik)[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Deobs are not the current method of creating bots - you just look at them to get a feel for how the client works. Without a lot of precautions, logging in with a modified deobfuscated client will almost guarantee detection. Most bots are made with bytecode editing (using <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel/index.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">BCEL</a>), which is a bit more complex and requires a good understanding of Java and the client specifically.</p>
