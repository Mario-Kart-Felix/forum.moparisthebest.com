    <title>Packing my client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/packing-my-client/328519</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re allowed to offer money for a fix but I really need to pack my client successfully so I can make it installable, exactly like 2speced&#39;s client and most others on Rune l0kus. I&#39;ve tried Ric&#39;s signed jar tutorial but when I try to run my jar file, Java appears for 2 seconds in my processes and then disappears. I&#39;m using a Battle Scape source and I really need this done by today

Please help me!
