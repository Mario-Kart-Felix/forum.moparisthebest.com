&lt;blockquote&gt;Hard house is typified by a set formula of up-tempo house music compressed kick drums, signature style off-beat basslines and the use of &#39;hoover&#39; type sounds. In contempt of the name it shares some parts in style with house music, but borrows elements heavily from trance music (synths and sometimes breakdown formula), and hardcore/rave music (hoover sounds, chants). Generally, hard house is part of a wider group of styles called Hard Dance and has little in common with the modern trance or house scenes going for a stronger storm sound. Hard Dance also encompasses NRG or Hard NRG, which UK Hard House is often confused for. However, the two have some variance from each other, and are considered two separate genres by Hard Dance enthusiasts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
