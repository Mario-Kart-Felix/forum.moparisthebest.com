[u][b]Brief description:[/b][/u]
This is not just some remake, this is the real thing. The old Uber 3.0 days are back! Unfortunately NO server could ever fill the gap, if you played Dodian back in the day you know why so many loved the server. If you liked Dodian, give us a try. We hope to see many new players, as well as some old faces!

Here at &#39;The Returning&#39; we welcome those players who are tired of the same old leeches you see on the status pages, and miss what Dodian once was.Now since it&#39;s a remake it does not mean that new updates won&#39;t happen... we just need the community to vote on a number of polls including:
*mummy drops in yanille dungeon
*new potions for herblore
*new thieving NPCs/objects
*the release of the farming skill
*new boss drop/requirements
*how snakeskin armor should be released into the game
*should gold jewellry crafting be released?
*should runecrafting yield multiple runes at a given level?
*should dicing be added and other gambling methods?
*what new fish should be introduced into the game?

***...and many more that aren&#39;t listed

All of the above will be made into polls on the community forums at: n/a [release date: 11/30]
In due time, with the help of a decent web developer, highscores, voting4rewards, and a webclient will be implemented and added to the list of features on the main site.
