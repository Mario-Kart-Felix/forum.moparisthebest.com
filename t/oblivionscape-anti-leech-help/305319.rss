    <description>At first i thought i was doing something wrong but i soon realized that sanity the owner made some sort of anti leech. when you try to connect to the server your client displays a message saying &quot;no response from server please try using a different world&quot;
so if anyone has figured this out or wants to try to help, id apreciate it.

i have portforwarded and it didnt help..
i have used other servers they work just fine..
this is the first time this has ever happened.</description>

              <p>This has something to do with the return code in the client class, if you’re usin a 317 server.<br>
If you’re using a 508, then I don’t know.</p>
