    <title>[REQ]Chaotic Shields on PI client[20$]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-chaotic-shields-on-pi-client-20/368059</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using a PI client and started with MTP v2 base, which has the ItemDef.java in it and has chaotic weapons. I know Chaotic Shields can be added because I&#39;ve seen them before. And I know I can simply copy from another client BUT I&#39;m lazy.

Please add me on MSN to further discuss this. DO NOT pm me telling me to add your MSN because I&#39;m not going to. I&#39;M LAZY.

Thanks! Jimmy

And whoever does this for me I&#39;ll like.. Love you forever and ask you to marry me. Thanks

(Doing this because many people have asked to donate for Chaotic Shields.)</description>
