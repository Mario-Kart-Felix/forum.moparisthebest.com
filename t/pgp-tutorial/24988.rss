    <title>PGP Tutorial</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pgp-tutorial/24988</link>
    <description>I wrote this tutorial for our signed trading policies on scar-scripts.com.  Figured I might as well repost it here because the directions work equally well for signing contracts, emails, and things like that.  Enjoy!

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the civilian encryption algorithms, PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is one of the best, and near military grade.  Its difficulty to crack has caused much grief to SIGINT groups worldwide, Fort Meade included.  For this reason, I have decided to use its digital signing features for account trading on these forums.

To use PGP, you&#39;ll need:
-[url=http://gpg4win.org/]The GNU Privacy Guard[/url], an Open Source PGP client.
-An internet connection.
-A suitable PC.

[b]Creating Your Encryption Key[/b]

1. Launch WinPT (The Windows Privacy Tray) from the GnuPG program folder.

2. Right click the tray icon and choose &quot;Key Manager&quot; from the menu.

3. If you&#39;ve just launched the program for the first time, the new key wizard should start automatically.  If it doesn&#39;t, choose Key ---&gt; New ---&gt; Normal.

4. In the resulting form, fill out your details for email address and name.  For scar-scripts, just make this your handle.

![b]Warning[/b]!:  If you create this key with your real name (not your handle), under most jurisdictions this encryption key will hold equal or greater legal value than a penned signature.  That means any document you digitally sign (ie a contract) will be legally binding.  Backup your real name key to a disk and keep it somewhere safe, and never use a real name key for trading on the forum!

5. The program will now prompt you for a passphrase.  Make it long (30+ characters) and keep it safe.

6. Now wait while your key is generated.  This could take a while.  You&#39;ll be treated to some ASCII while you wait.

7.  To copy your public key (the one you post to the site) to the clipboard, right click on it and choose &quot;Copy Key to Clipboard.&quot;  Add this to our [url=http://forum.scar-scripts.com/showthread.php?t=308]public keys directory[/url].

[b]Digitally Signing a Document[/b]

1. First write out the document you want to sign.  When trading on the forum, this will be the standard trading contract, which you can find in the PGP sticky in the Black Market section.

2. Now navigate to your file.  Right click on it and choose GPGee ---&gt; sign.

3. In the combo box, choose your key.  Make sure &quot;detached&quot; is checked.  You can set it attached if you have an ASCII file, but I just prefer to use a detached file.  You will be prompted for your passphrase.

4. You will find a new file has been generated.  Upload this and your original file to the site in .zip format.

[b]Adding a Public Key[/b]

1. Get the public key of someone else from a trusted source, such as our directory.  Copy this to the clipboard (Control + C).
[IMG]http://img168.imageshack.us/img168/8241/img13.jpg[/img]

2. Paste this into a text file and save it.  Call it anything you like.
[IMG]http://img168.imageshack.us/img168/3348/img14.jpg[/img]

3. In the Key Manager, choose Key ---&gt; Import.  Navigate to the saved file.

[b]Verifying a message.[/b]
To verify a signature, right click on the .asc file (with the original document in the same directory), choose GPGee ---&gt; Verify/Decrypt.  A window will come up reporting success or failure.



Well, that covers the basics of signing with PGP.  Perhaps later I&#39;ll write an encryption tutorial.  Report your success/failure here.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
