    <description>I&#39;m using Evoluitonx client + source but i can&#39;t change anything in client.java!!!!!!!!!!!! what i do =

for example i try to change command of ::home in client . java 

if(command.startsWith(&quot;home&quot;)){
triggerTele(3093, 3493, 0);
brightness = 4;
}

i just change coord numbers i compile i restart = NOTHING HAPPENS!!!!!!!!! now the funny thing is my friend does like exactly same thing i do but for him it does work!!!! i tried to redownload source still NOTHING HAPPENS when i try it..and compiler is good because when i try to add like an npc in autspawn that does work!!! :mad: :mad: I need HELP :S if i can&#39;t edit client.java what&#39;s the point of making rsps then :S

if exist &quot;%programfiles%\Java&quot; (call :compile &quot;%programfiles%\Java\&quot;) else (goto error)
:compile
for /D %%x in (&quot;%~1jdk*&quot;) do (set p=&quot;%%~x\bin\javac.exe&quot;)
if defined p (%p% -cp . *.java)
