    <description>Hi there reader!
[size=14pt][b]This thread was made to show my progression as a modeler.[/b][/size]
I aim at being a seasoned modeler and this thread is to show how I go from bad to good.
These models were not intended in actual use. If you do somehow like them and wish to use them, then go ahead.
If you would like to improve on them, or even just show them off, I&#39;d be happy if you left my name :)

Note:
The first couple are a bit plain, that&#39;s because I only made them to get a feel for the tools.

[size=24pt]Ice Wand[/size]

This is my first model so be nice!
I&#39;ll admit, it does look a little shit. But again it&#39;s my first model (EVER)

It was meant to look all jagged on the top.

I based it off of the Air Battlestaff from current Runescape:
I removed a bit of the top, made it smaller and recolored it.
I ran into a problem when decreasing the polygons, because of it&#39;s size, it was pretty hard to make it not glitch the hell out.

[size=24pt]Ice Wand 2.0[/size]

So this is an improvement to my last wand, well it was supposed to be anyway.

[size=24pt]Sword of Eire[/size]
[IMG]http://i39.tinypic.com/bgtq55.png[/img]
This is my attempt to make a sword.
This was made with the help of another user on the forums [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=385410]Amy_Webb[/url]
Many thanks to her for the help. I used techniques she showed me, to practice while making this.

[size=24pt]Zarosian Sword (NO SYMBOL)[/size]
[IMG]http://i39.tinypic.com/b7yl9x.jpg[/img]
[size=24pt]THE SYMBOL ISN&#39;T THERE ATM, TOO MANY POLYGONS![/size]
[b]I&#39;m going to try to add the symbol sooner or later though![/b]

This is my attempt to make a second sword.

              <p>That new model isn’t your best, it looks like a poker. You used far too much poly on the grip, rather then practicing what i taught you. Also the colour palette doesn’t match very well, or you haven’t used the colours well together. We’ll have to go over these things later, but keep to tips that people give you and try not to go backwards.</p>
<p>His models are too basic at the moment to use sym, was going to show him when he learned to use his tools more efficiently. I’ve never used the magnent tool, or found a use for it for i wouldn’t say it was a good method, but for you it may work well. As for extrude, i’ve glanced over it with him, but he still needs to learn a little more about it.</p>

<p>Take more time with your models. each model even to a seasoned modeler takes more than 30 minutes or so to make decent. unless its something very plain and simple which not many seasoned modelers wouldn’t dabble in. Those concepts could be made so much better. But you are a beginner and as a beginner i respect you on your use of prims. Many beginners used the whole trace method.

<p>Yeah, I know your not trying to be mean.<br>
I did most of these just to test out the tools, get a feel for them.<br>
I want to make something grand once I know what I’m doing.</p>

If your model is too small it will make it look choppy, i’ve experienced this.</p>
<p>Try sketch out ideas before modelling them, it gives you a better understand of what you want to achieve and you can edit the idea as you go along.</p>
<p>Basic shapes i mean, try to avoid adding every little detail, just get the base so you don’t poly over kill or make the wireframe look unbearable. Primitives are not shapes you throw into a model, they’re the base of a shape. Look at a primitive as you would a block of clay, it is your foundation, you mold it to the way you want it. This is achieved using the tools provided, knife is a good tool to use, as it allows you to cut across faces.</p>
<p>Instead of using ball primitives along the shaft, make cuts for either side of the ball you want. once you’ve got as many cuts as you need, go back and make cuts in the middle of these two lines. You will then need to select and use the yellow scaling block to expand the middle, this will give it the ball type look without having a lot of poly. If you need an example, i’d be happy to draw it out for you.</p>
<p>I’ve tried to make videos multiple times, but have always run into a problem. One day i’ll get around to making a good one, but it may be awhile. Until then, just ask an advanced modeler in this section for help. We’re all willing to help, we want to see people improve. No question is ever too silly to be answered, we just require you to seek help.<br>

<p>amy helped me when i started modeling, i can help you sometime if you want. im far from as good as amy though. i usually make base models and she touches em up for me :p[/quote]<br>

<p>Yea, it’s DatMaker doing the choppy work.<br>
Making the Ice Wand i literally just made it up as i went, but it was based on the Air Battlestaf, which i used as a reference picture.</p>
<p>Basic shapes for models? You mean using primitives?<br>
If so then, I am having trouble using them because I almost never have anywhere to use them. My latest wand (Saradomin Wand) has spheres (not balls xD) going along the shaft. I would have used a primitive for the shaft, but since the shaft was getting thinner along it, I didn’t exactly know what to do there.<br>
I’m not really finding anywhere to use primitives.</p>
<p>It’s too bad there aren’t many Metasequoia video tutorials out there, as i am a visual learner  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

I’m not really a modeler, so I can’t give you much ‘technical’ advice… but I believe you should try to use primitives in your next model, this one seems a bit choppy.</p>
<p>Regardless, nice job, better than I can make <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Yea it is isn’t it.<br>
And i probably should have used primitives, instead of doing everything by hand. Thanks for the advice, appreciate it :)[/quote]<br>
Primitives speed the modeling process up and also lets you to create more complex models. May I see a wireframe?</p>

              <p>Hi there reader!<br>
[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b">This thread was made to show my progression as a modeler.</span>[/size]<br>
I aim at being a seasoned modeler and this thread is to show how I go from bad to good.<br>
These models were not intended in actual use. If you do somehow like them and wish to use them, then go ahead.<br>
If you would like to improve on them, or even just show them off, I’d be happy if you left my name <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Note:<br>
The first couple are a bit plain, that’s because I only made them to get a feel for the tools.</p>
<p>[size=24pt]Ice Wand[/size]<br>
<img src="http://i42.tinypic.com/2l72uc.png" alt width="505" height="172"><br>
This is my first model so be nice!<br>
I’ll admit, it does look a little shit. But again it’s my first model (EVER)</p>
<p>It was meant to look all jagged on the top.</p>
<p>I based it off of the Air Battlestaff from current Runescape:<br>
I removed a bit of the top, made it smaller and recolored it.<br>
I ran into a problem when decreasing the polygons, because of it’s size, it was pretty hard to make it not glitch the hell out.</p>

[size=24pt]Ice Wand 2.0[/size]<br>
<img src="http://i42.tinypic.com/21pmad.png" alt width="463" height="157"><br>
So this is an improvement to my last wand, well it was supposed to be anyway.<br>

Many thanks to her for the help. I used techniques she showed me, to practice while making this.<br>
