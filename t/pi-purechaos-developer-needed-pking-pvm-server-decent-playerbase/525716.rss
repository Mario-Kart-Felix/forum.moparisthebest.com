[u][b]Introduction[/b][/u]

Purechaos is a Pking/PvM server that has been put online almost 2 months ago, in that time we came far reaching 55 online players and things such as sponsored on the Moparscape server list and sponsored on Top100.

We always have 25 or more online and in the evening a stable 40 that can peak to over 50.

We are currently hosted on a 2GB Vps, this host is decent but we get new host for sure. We are aiming for a dedicated server with AMAZING specs from the great host provider NFOservers.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Intel Xeon E3-1270 processor (four physical 3.4ghz cores on QPI + hyperthreading + turbo-&gt;3.8ghz)
16 GB DDR3-1333 ECC memory
1000 GB, 7200 RPM SATA hard drive
10000 GB of InterNAP bandwidth&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[u][b]Our team[/b][/u]

Me and Lestic are running the server, my job is to be the developer and Lestic his job is playing the manager and works on the site.

Ingame we currently have 1 admin that is highly trusted and 2 mods which are also trusted and they proven them self many times.

[u][b]What are we looking for[/b][/u]

We are currently looking a new server developer that knows what he/she is doing, that has experience in working with PI, has Skype and no lack of motivation.

If you make your application we will review you and I will find out on Skype chatting how much you know about Java and PI in general.

You have to be active to, we cant use someone that is online 10 hours a week or never response.

Our team is doing everything to get to the top so we are going to need someone that fits in with us.

We only ask you to be good in server side, if you are good in client that is a +.

Why should I consider you:
Anything else?:&lt;/blockquote&gt;
