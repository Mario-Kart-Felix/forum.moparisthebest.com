    <title>Could Lightning Have Damaged My Phone?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/could-lightning-have-damaged-my-phone/552617</link>
    <description>Alright, so for the past few hours my phone has struggled to keep any 1X/3G/4G connection at all. I&#39;ve restarted it multiple times, cleared the cache, etc. However it still sits at 1X and sometimes gets 3G, but often drops signal entirely forcing me to restart. It started doing this right after I drove home through a storm, in which lightning struck close enough to set off car alarms in cars in parking spaces right next to me. Could this be a cause, or is it more likely that my carrier is having issues? Other phones in the house have signal, at least it says they do but I haven&#39;t tested to see if it actually sends messages.</description>

<p>It’s much more likely that it’s unrelated. The noise/vibrations are what set off the car alarms, not the EM disturbance. I doubt it could have an effect on your phone.[/quote]<br>
Updated my spelling, I’ve never been that great with spelling or grammar in general.</p>
<p>Anyways, the example with the car alarms was to kinda show how close it was. I’ll take your word for it and see if it straightens itself out. Messages seem to be sending a bit more like normal as the storm leaves the county. Still nowhere near as fast.</p>
