    <title>Server is up, people are playing, but Moparscape said it&#39;s offline o.o</title>

    <description>Due to VPS problems I had to purchase a new, more powerful VPS from another company to host my server. This new VPS has not gone down at all, and has had people playing since the moment I set it up, however, it has lost a few points of uptime for no reason. One of my staff members reported that our Moparscape page said we were offline, when in fact we were online with multiple people playing.

I&#39;m guessing this is due to a problem with the Mopar script that pings the servers. My server is hosted in the Netherlands currently, and has a ping of 175 for me on the other side of the globe. Would that cause it to come up as Offline?

If there&#39;s anything I can do to prevent this from happening again, help me out please. I spent a bit more cash on a VPS I was confident in it&#39;s ability to keep 100% uptime, only for this to happen.</description>
