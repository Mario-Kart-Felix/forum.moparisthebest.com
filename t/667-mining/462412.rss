    <title>667 Mining!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/667-mining/462412</link>
    <description>Hey, so I&#39;m trying to add custom mining on my 667 source. 

What I&#39;ve done so far is:
Make it so you only get one ore each time you mine it. I slowed down the time it takes to get an ore, modified the level requirements, and modified the XP per ore mined, etc.

What I need to do, is stop the rocks from disappearing after I mine an ore. For some reason, the rock disappears as soon as I get the first ore.

This is part of the code in mining.java. It should be all that&#39;s needed to fix it, but I&#39;m not sure.

[code]		Copper_Ore(1, 10, 436, 10, 10, 14906, 0, 1), 
		Tin_Ore(1, 10, 438, 10, 10, 14902, 0, 1), 
		Iron_Ore(15, 15, 440, 10, 10, 14856, 0, 1),  
		Coal_Ore(30, 25, 453, 10, 10, 14850, 0, 1), 
		Gold_Ore(40, 32, 444, 10, 10, 2098, 0, 1), 
		Mithril_Ore(55, 40, 447, 10, 10, 14853, 0, 1), 
		Adamant_Ore(70, 45, 449, 10, 10, 14862, 0, 1), 
		Runite_Ore(85, 50, 451, 20, 20, 14859, 0, 1);[/code]

If you need to know what any of those numbers mean to help me out, or you need any other part of the code in order to help, let me know. :)

Thanks!</description>
