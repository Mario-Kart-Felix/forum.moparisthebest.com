    <title>[Galkons] Creating Percent / Progress Bars?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/galkons-creating-percent-progress-bars/520358</link>
    <description>I was looking to make an accurate but still appealing way to display stats somewhere in the gameframe without adding 50 generic orbs all around the minimap and thought it would be a decent Idea to make a tab that displayed percentages in the forms of progress bars.

Looking at Orb tutorials for a base to run off of was unsuccessful as these &quot;tutorials&quot; were massively spoon-fed and thus inapplicable.  Perhaps what I really need is for someone to explain in-depth how the draining visuals function, or better yet point me to an alternative.</description>
