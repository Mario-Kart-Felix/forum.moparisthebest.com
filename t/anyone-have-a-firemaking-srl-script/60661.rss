<p>This script will NOT get logs from bank for you.<br>
The script will light the logs for you. Find a long stretch of area to light logs, hit F6 and then maybe go do something. All this script does is light the logs. Then, when you have no more logs, it waits. Also, if the script is not lighting for you, make sure that the botom line in the chat box is NOT ‘You can not light logs here’.</p>
<p>Tell me if it works.</p>
