<p>The only advice I could give you is take it slow, work on one thing at a time. Have a few administrators control the development team, have 2 or 3 developers working on each base; even more if you’re creating your own framework. Don’t give anyone access to the files who you don’t trust.</p>

              <p>How many developers are you planning on having for 5 servers all from a different era? That’s going to take some very knowledgeable people from each of those eras in RuneScape and some pretty talented programmers.</p>
