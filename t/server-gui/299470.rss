    <description>Hey everyone
I&#39;m looking for a 508 server GUI that will yell to the server
and other stuff
i once downloaded a 525 source with an awesome GUI the source was Pur3zscape 525 but i didn&#39;t end up using that source.
is there anyway i can use that GUI for a 508 and take it out of there?
or is there another GUI i can get?
i have searched all over Google and couldn&#39;t find anything</description>
