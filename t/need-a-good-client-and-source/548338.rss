              <p>ok but i look for rsps clients and source but half of them either don’t load client, also do most of them have auto cache downloader or do i have to do this myself?</p>

<p>Get yourself an IDE (Try Eclipse.) Download a bunch of popular sources and clients, and fuck with them all. They’ll all have their own different quirks and features, maybe you’ll have fun mashing a couple of things together? The thing is you need to just jump in and fuck with all the things, instead of us trying to read your mind what you want - which at this point nobody knows <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Just get into it.</p>

<p>Btw programming and programming RSPS is the same thing so if you want to learn to program a RSPS you need to learn to program full stop. Just learn the basics of Java. Integers, Strings, creating new instances of classes etc. and you will then be able to pick things up.</p>
<p>Try using an IDE too it will make life much easier. Eclipse is a good one.</p>
