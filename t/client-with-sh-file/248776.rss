    <title>Client with sh file</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-with-sh-file/248776</link>
    <description>Is there any client, other than Mopar&#39;s, that has an sh file that I can operate on ubuntu.

I have a server running on ubuntu.
But, I need a client with a .sh so I can run it.

Any links to a good client that has an sh file to run?</description>
