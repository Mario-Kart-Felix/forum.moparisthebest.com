    <title>REPOST: Special Fatal Error Help..?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/repost-special-fatal-error-help/202097</link>
    <description>Well, I posted this before. I&#39;ve had the problem for weeks now, but still no help.. I guess I&#39;ll just repost it? Hopefully you&#39;ll see it.

Thanks.

Well, I never noticed this before, so I guess this is new..

I logged on and started walking around, thinking what I could add to my source next. I got bored of thinking and went to the shops. I bought a Dragon Dagger (s). I clicked the special bar, and I disconnected.. I checked the logs, and I got this..

Well, I have no idea what it could be. I&#39;ve checked the lines that it says to in the logs, but I still can&#39;t seem to find the problem.

Help is appreciated. Thanks.</description>
