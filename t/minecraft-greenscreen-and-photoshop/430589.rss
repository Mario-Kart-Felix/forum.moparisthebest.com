    <title>Minecraft, Greenscreen, and photoshop</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/minecraft-greenscreen-and-photoshop/430589</link>
    <description>I was zooming around on youtube and found a video of someone (in minecraft) but walking around on a IRL picture of a beach, I decided to see how greenscreen worked inside of minecraft. This is what I found.

1&gt; Replace glowstone texture with a solid bright color (i highly suggest green: 0x0ae800)

2&gt; Build a basic box out of glowstone (probably best to be in creative mode for this) and stand in it.

3&gt; Take a screenshot (f2) or setup a basic MC server really fast to take a picture of yourself on another account.

4&gt; Load the image into photoshop and crop out the green.
NOTE: This may still leave a very small amount of green around your character, nothing hard to fix. To create a small &#39;antialias&#39; around the edges I created a mask limited to the character, then used a Gaussian blur (2.0 pixels) on the mask.

5&gt; Add layers and designs to make yourself a wallpaper.

<p>if youll notice, you can still see green around your character[/quote] it can be easily fixed.  I was going for a quick patch for the sake of the tutorial. I can do a much better picture if I wanted to.</p>
