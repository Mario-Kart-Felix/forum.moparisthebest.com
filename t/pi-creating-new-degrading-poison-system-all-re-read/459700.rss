    <description>[center][size=36pt]Creating new Degrading &amp; Poison system.[/size][/center]
[center][size=20pt]Server/Client Base: Project Insanity 317.[/size][/center]
[size=15pt]Overall Goal?:[/size]
I am trying to create basically a whole new Degrading &amp; Poison System.
[size=15pt]Problem?:[/size]
I have absolutely [b]no[/b] idea where to start.
[size=15pt]Description example:[/size]
I will have ALOT more uses for it than just this but this is my first example; I want to have a item that runs on its own &quot;Degrading&quot; system, and after you buy it [size=14pt]!ONCE![/size] from any shop [size=14pt][b]or[/b][/size] player then it does something to your character that you cannot go (random(misc)15-30 minutes without having this item equipped. But the item &quot;Degrades&quot; within (random(misc)5-10 minutes. Then I want a brand new &quot;Poison&quot; system, where the poison ONLY effects you if you have bought the item I described at least [size=14pt]!ONCE![/size] from a shop [size=14pt][b]or[/b][/size] player. But if you wield the item, then it cures you UNTIL it &quot;degrades&quot; then you are poisoned again. I would LIKE for the poison to hit a &quot;9&quot; on you every 60 seconds.

P.S. If anything is unclear please feel free to quote the part that is unclear and ask me about it.

This is something I would really like to have help on, I [size=20pt]DO NOT[/size] expect to be &quot;Spoonfeed&quot;, I would simple just like assistance.

ALRIGHT, Please no spam. Let&#39;s stay on topic and make this a learning/helping environment, any help is appreciated and encouraged.

This really isn&#39;t as big and scary as it looks....
It&#39;s just with the Degrading system, I need to make it where a item only has a certain time limit before it disappears.
Then with the poisoning system, it&#39;s just if you have bought a item at least once before then your character is PERMANENTLY poisoned without that item wielded.
I just need a little help with codes and placing.</description>

I will have ALOT more uses for it than just this but this is my first example; I want to have a item that runs on its own “Degrading” system, and after you buy it [size=14pt]!ONCE![/size] from any shop [size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b">or</span>[/size] player then it does something to your character that you cannot go (random(misc)15-30 minutes without having this item equipped.
