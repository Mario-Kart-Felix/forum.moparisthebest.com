    <title>Just a little something I see</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/just-a-little-something-i-see/429536</link>
    <description>Everyone wants this server to be more of a community than everyone working alone.  But then I see people not working together that well like they aren&#39;t really even trying.  The way I see it is if I need something and someone else has I&#39;ll ask them for it then if they need something and I have it I&#39;ll give it to them if I&#39;m able to.  

I feel like if you want to be a community you need to work together and at least try to get along most of the time.  Communities don&#39;t steal from each other, even though it&#39;s not against the rules not to, it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the best way to get something.  

Also my idea is where the community should make the decisions and the majority goes.  I know there are some topics where MITB should handle or the other mods.  

This is just my thought on this whole community thing.</description>

              <p>i fully agree. i like the building projects that everyone can chip in to build like a community tower wher we all our own design to sections of it to see how it all blends together and see each others unique ideal style. i also dislike the looting going on, like tom has done. plus not too many people are on to do anyhting together <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

              <p>well we had something nice going in the town manbearpig and i created. itx expanding and getting huge, but people loot each other and play stupid pranks like “putting 1000 boats in X’s house”. pisses people off and most of the time they will want to retaliate. there are 2 problems with that. one, you shouldn’t do something that’s going to piss the community off. and two, you shouldn’t want to retaliate, especially if its a community member.</p>
<p>and being that most of the mc players on this server are males and males never get along(must be some dominance bullshit) lol.</p>

<p>that’s exactly what i said, and that’s the reason i haven’t looted anyone in the city. hell i haven’t even looked for anyone’s hidden chest spot because i have no reason to be in someones “secrets” without asking first.</p>
<p>but i also feel that maybe the people that actually play the server should have a bit more say then the ones that don’t. everyone says they aren’t playing because the server isn’t “1.0.0”. but its not hard to downgrade your client to play the server, the point is that they are too lazy to do such. and at the rate we are going, when we do upgrade to 1.0.0, 1.0.2 is going to be out and everyone is going to bitch and complain for mopar to update it to that… ect.</p>
<p>figured i would add my opinion. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
