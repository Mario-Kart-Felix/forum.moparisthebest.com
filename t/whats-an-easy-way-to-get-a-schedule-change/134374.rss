    <title>What&#39;s an easy way to get a schedule change?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whats-an-easy-way-to-get-a-schedule-change/134374</link>
    <description>Well damn.
I got my schedule today, and just compared it to my two best friends, and found out we have NO classes together.
The class I wanted to take [and have taken lower versions of it for the past 4 years] started doing background checks this year due to &quot;trouble makers&quot; and due to my &quot;history&quot; [none of which happened in the particular class] i wasn&#39;t allowed in.
Because of that I either could take an art class or a computer class, computers being one of my skills, I took that.
The scheduler told me that advanced classes would be at a different block so I would have to have a schedule change if I got into those [with permission from the computer guy]. I&#39;m trying that and HOPING that I can at least get in 1 class with my friends, preferably as many as possible :)
Anyways, does anyone have any ideas on how to get a schedule change without like hacking the school or something?
I&#39;ve gotten into enough trouble already and don&#39;t want to go down that road.</description>
