    <title>Barter System</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/barter-system/518682</link>
    <description>This is something I attempted to do back in 2011-2012 when I ran FJ.

I am interested in getting feedback on how a barter system can:

-Be implemented/started
-Continued for several months
-How to keep the value of items the same over periods of time without discontinuing (if possible)</description>

              <p>Well in this project it’s a mix sort of like a Harry Potter/Runescape mix if that makes sense.</p>
<p>You start off as a 1st year and you can ear certain robes/armor etc at whatever year you are at. I haven’t written the full story line/system yet however there may be “advanced students” who are able to wear robes on a higher level for like partial time.(if that makes sense…)</p>
<p>I haven’t decided if I am wanting to make it just drops or to release like a school point type of shop that is opened during certain times like during a “school time” type of schedule.</p>
<p>I would love to get all the feedback I can though on this.</p>

              <p>more depth in the concept. npcs trading items for items, or players?</p>
<p>if it’s npcs trading players for item swaps, then create a method to define the upper bounds and lower bounds of the cost of the item(s) and base it between the middle or w/e, then find an item of a similar price. this can be done externally or hardcoded (suggest not).<br>
however, although this idea is nice, i don’t think it would work very well if your basing it throughout your server; as players might demand a certain item more then another (or need it more), if this is the case then people would be trying to get a specific item to obtain within that region. furthermore, you’ll going to have to implement a lot of npc drops, just sayin’ <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
