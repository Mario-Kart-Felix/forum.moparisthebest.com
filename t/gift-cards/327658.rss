    <description>So, apparently there is this kid with legitimate proof that he &quot;hacked&quot; or found a bug in Visa gift cards. Let&#39;s put it this way.

Game coins = .10/per coin
So every 10 coins is $1.00 USD
100 - $10 USD
1000 - $100 USD
Alright, we get the picture.

So, this person purchased a $25.00 USD Visa Gift Card, and apparently was able to purchase more then the limit? He bought about 1000 game coins (which is $100 USD) with a $25.00 USD card. No clue how, but maybe you guys might have a suggestion? I am considering it is illegal...abusing a bug :3.

If I didn&#39;t explain it enough, tell me. I&#39;ll explain it more thoroughly.</description>
