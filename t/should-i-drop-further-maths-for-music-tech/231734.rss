<p>It depends if you need maths for your degree. What do you plan on doing at Uni? If you don’t need Maths, and can read music (pretty important, at least to my Music Tech class) then go for it, it’s fuckin’ fun. You’ll never have so much fun doing coursework as Music Tech <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>well i do still take normal maths aswell and i think it is possible for me to take both  because a mate of mine is in all of my lessons cept for further maths and he takes music tech so it would slot in nicely<br>
Further maths is always 6th period and doesn’t finish till 5 every time, admittedly half the time it still is at my school but its wanky</p>

              <p>Well further maths is probably the harder course and therefore recognized by more universities.<br>
And then Music tech is something that’ll be more fun but probably wont be welcomed by most universities.</p>
<p>I’d say stick with further maths but your circumstances seem like that’d be the sucky answer.</p>
