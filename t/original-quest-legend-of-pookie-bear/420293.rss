    <title>Original Quest - Legend of Pookie Bear</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/original-quest-legend-of-pookie-bear/420293</link>
    <description>Hey guys!
So I have been working on a server for about 1.5 years now..
I&#39;m getting close to finishing it, so I&#39;ve started posing some media about it.

This is a clip from a custom quest I&#39;ve added.

The premise of the quest is:
there once was a warrior named Pookie Bear.
he died while defending Varrock from the evil Lord Poe.
years later you come and awaken then spirit located at Pookie&#39;s grave.
he tells you that he is Pookie and asks you to revive him.
you gotta collect some of his items that were scattered around.
every time you collect an item, you feel more and more in sync with Pookie&#39;s presence.
you end up reliving his final battle and experiencing, first hand, his story.

It is based of an inside joke, so don&#39;t mock the lame names.

some things to take note of:
it is an instance, meaning only you can see whats going on and nobody can see you
merlin will call in reinforcements as long as he is still in the fight
if merlin takes too much damage he will teleport away
the two white knights are defensive pets for the king
when you are a bear, it does drain your special energy, thats not some &#39;rune scim spec&#39;
if you die during the quest, you will fail that cutscene, 
and you&#39;ll be bumped back to where you were before you retrieved the last items.


The release date of the server is TBA.
Development is currently very slow. 
My nerd time goes to playing all the new video games that are in the process of being released.
However, expect to hear more from me very soon :)</description>
