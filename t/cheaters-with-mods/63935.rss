    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cheaters-with-mods/63935</link>
    <description>my friend got banned today. I will tell you the story. So there is this moderator who is spawn killing people at the shop with his mod cape on. My friend tries to kill him then the mod kills him, he goes back and tries to get his stuff back and he got some stuff back then the mod said if you pick that up ur banned, then he got banned 10 minutes later. Tell me if this is right</description>
