    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-loading-602-webclient-client/397032</link>
    <description>Look, I have both webclient and client. And i have the cache i downloaded manually. Anyway I want to make this automatic so I tried and couldnt. So how could I make me client and webclient both Download the &quot;Right&quot; Cache. (if someone doesent have it), because it always downloads a small part. any idea why and what i can do? and how i can change the link to download &quot;My&quot; Specific Cache?</description>
