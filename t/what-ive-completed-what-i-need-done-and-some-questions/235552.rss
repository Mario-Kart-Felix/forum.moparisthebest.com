    <title>What I&#39;ve Completed What I Need Done and Some Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-ive-completed-what-i-need-done-and-some-questions/235552</link>
    <description>Ok I have officially taken the name HiddenScape here is what I have completed:
Added a server panel 100%
Added a high score board 75% (when you click on anything with an action it pulls up highscores)
Added correct godsword stances and attacks
Made a couple adjustments on bonuses
Made somewhat of a client
Made crash-protection
Unencrypted passwords

What I need to do:
Make fletching, fishing, crafting, firemaking, herblore, agility, slayer, theiving, smithing, cooking, and runecrafting work better.
Add a more commands
Add in a client armor
Add in a custom sword
Fix armadyl helmet glitch in client (need model id)
Add some training areas
Add better graphics to client
Make all item ids in client in the 16000&#39;s
Add a clan system
Add a grand exchange
Add dogs as pets
Add summoning skill
Add scrollable inventory (possibly up to 200 items)
Add a HiddenScape monster ( highest level possible and nobody can defeat)
Add Invincibilty ring 
Add swimming
And fix trade error

A couple of questions:
1.If I added a highscore board and the code to make it work is
[code]int ObjectID = 3192;
{
Highscore();
}[/code]
and whenever I click any object with an action like trees and gates and it opens highscores, how do I make it just the highscore board that opens the highscores?

2. What is the model id for an armadyl helm?

3. How do I fix the trade error? If you take an item off, it disappears and the trade stops working and you can&#39;t trade again until you log out then back in? How do I fix?
Thanks for looking.</description>

OK, i think you should go over rules and my post was clearly stating action being forced upon you. its not pointless unlike most of your post on this forum. you cant even use a proper sentence.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Its also a rule not to post bullshit unless ITS NECESSARY otherwise youll get warned… check the updated rules.[/quote]it’s also a rule to stop trolling/flaming as fast as you can, hence the fact of just ignoring it all together if it is possible. Although no one can really stop that, and i guess that includes me. Not everyone escapes the threshold we call the rules.</p>

</ul>
<p>btw, i think i may have answered your question about the highscore things in a separate thread. Everything else looks pretty nice.</p>

              <p>Ok I have officially taken the name HiddenScape here is what I have completed:<br>
Added a server panel 100%<br>
Added a high score board 75% (when you click on anything with an action it pulls up highscores)<br>
Added correct godsword stances and attacks<br>
Made a couple adjustments on bonuses<br>
Made somewhat of a client<br>
Made crash-protection<br>
Unencrypted passwords</p>
<p>What I need to do:<br>
Make fletching, fishing, crafting, firemaking, herblore, agility, slayer, theiving, smithing, cooking, and runecrafting work better.<br>
Add a more commands<br>
Add in a client armor<br>
Add in a custom sword<br>
Fix armadyl helmet glitch in client (need model id)<br>
Add some training areas<br>
Add better graphics to client<br>
Make all item ids in client in the 16000’s<br>
Add a clan system<br>
Add a grand exchange<br>
Add dogs as pets<br>
Add summoning skill<br>
Add scrollable inventory (possibly up to 200 items)<br>
Add a HiddenScape monster ( highest level possible and nobody can defeat)<br>
Add Invincibilty ring<br>
Add swimming<br>
And fix trade error</p>
<p>A couple of questions:<br>
1.If I added a highscore board and the code to make it work is</p>
<p><code>int ObjectID = 3192;
{
Highscore();
}</code><br>
and whenever I click any object with an action like trees and gates and it opens highscores, how do I make it just the highscore board that opens the highscores?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>What is the model id for an armadyl helm?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do I fix the trade error? If you take an item off, it disappears and the trade stops working and you can’t trade again until you log out then back in? How do I fix?<br>
Thanks for looking.</p>
</li>
</ol>
