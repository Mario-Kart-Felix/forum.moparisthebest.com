    <description>I was wondering if ne1 had the source from the old Key pk server? the one were u spawn in varrok wildy with the training portals and shops all right there? Also i am looking for someone to kinda help me out with starting this new server if you would be nice enough to add me on MSN, Td33pa@yahoo.com. Also if i cant get a hold of the keypk source i was wondering on any recomendations for a basic varrok pking server.</description>
