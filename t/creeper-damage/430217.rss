    <title>Creeper damage</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creeper-damage/430217</link>
    <description>This is starting to be an issue, I spent hours making a roof with Si force and I come back to find FIVE creeper explosion holes in it.

I actually think it&#39;s deathschaos9 who&#39;s doing it and his brothers, I caught deaths once doing it and he just ignored me, then I come back on today to find five new holes in my roof with no evidence to be seen anywhere. 

If we have no way of combating griefing with creepers then why are the explosions turned on? It&#39;s not a case of when people say &quot;it&#39;s original, adds more of a challenge!&quot; it&#39;s a case of players getting griefed and nothing being done to the people who do it. 

I&#39;d like to use Tarkoffs island as an example, I could easily create a stair way up and lure creepers and completely destroy such a nice structure and there would be nothing anyone could do about it, there would be 0 evidence. It&#39;s insane how they aren&#39;t disabled yet. 

PS posted here because it&#39;s a matter of enforcement.</description>

              <p>Wait… how many people want to blow up my island?</p>
<p>But I’m on the fence about this issue.</p>
<p>AGREE:<br>
-Having something that your afraid of adds to the fun of the game. DONT GO OUT AT NIGHT.<br>
-The added challenge of inventing security to keep them away.<br>
-Id like to think that no one would be such a dick to “lure” a creeper to grief.</p>
<p>DISAGREE:<br>
-It limits the type of buildings that people make. I personally was going to make stuff in the UN spot creepers stopped me.<br>
-Noob players not intending to grief soon become the worst.<br>
-I suspect that the “torching” of the land to keep them away is causing peoples lag issues.</p>
<p>So I’m just not sure it really depends what type of world you want. A hard action type game, or a peaceful creative world for building.<br>
I personally was a bit sad to see were not playing at hard setting any more. But some of the younger/ laggy players have a bad time with it.</p>

              <p>You’d obviously remove the room (would be like 5x5 room), entire thing would take like 5 minutes to lure the creeper. it’d take like 64 blocks of dirt to do the entire thing, coordinated at a low activity time and even if I was caught they’d sound like idiots when they came to report me.</p>

<p>[center][size=8pt]How to grief Tarkoffs island by Tom5001[/size][/center]</p>
<p>If I was to blow up Tarkoffs island I would make a HUGE crane like tower going to the absolute limit, lure the creepers up into a dark room and then use Tarkoffs pool to push them onto his island - NOTE this leaves 0 hawk evidence and nobody would have thought to hawk every single block up/down to the height limit/cared to do it anyway.</p>
<p>To be safe, I would then lure them into a small darkish area of Tarkoffs chapel and wait for a while, perhaps log off to throw any chance of server logs incriminating me (Moparisthebests secret tool!) I would then log back on detonate the creepers in correlation to the darkness and tactically to do enough damage to his pocket/looks of the island.</p>
<p>Then if I wanted to be really horrible I would play off the servers popular beliefs that certain people are responsible for everything and get them blamed for it.</p>
<p>Point I’m making is if I can think of a way around every system put in place by us then why can’t someone else? What I’m trying to say is that this moat idea won’t work, if I can get up onto an island and detonate creepers without anyone knowing then do you really think some crappy little moat is going to do much good? Someone could do all this, and you keep it on  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
