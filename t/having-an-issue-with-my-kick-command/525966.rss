    <title>Having an issue with my Kick command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/having-an-issue-with-my-kick-command/525966</link>
    <description>Hello, I have been trying to get my kick code to work for about an hour trying multiple things but nothing seems to make it work. Here&#39;s what I have at the moment.

[code]if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;kick&quot;)) {
		 PlayerHandler.kickNick = command.substring(5);
                        sendMessage(&quot;You have kicked &quot;+command.substring(5));
                        System.out.println(&quot;Admin &quot;+playerName+&quot; is kicking &quot;+command.substring(5)+&quot;.&quot;);
                }[/code]

I currently do not have any playerRights set up for it because I thought maybe it was conflicting with something. I&#39;ll add the rights again later. Please, if you have any idea why this isn&#39;t working, help me fix it. Thanks.</description>

<p>You need to make it disconnect the player, here’s an example that won’t work for you but will give you an idea.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">String name = command.substring(5);
Player other = getPlayer(name); //loops through the players online and retrieves the player specified

other.disconnected = true;
sendMessage(name +" has been kicked.");</code></pre>
