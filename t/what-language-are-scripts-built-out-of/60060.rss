    <title>What language are scripts built out of?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-language-are-scripts-built-out-of/60060</link>
    <description>What language are these scripts built out of?

If it&#39;s a useful language I might be interested in learning it through this :D

And would it be hard for me to learn? (Being that I know C and PHP - is it any similar to either of these?)</description>

              <p>SCAR scripts don’t specifically use a language, there based on pascal.</p>
<p>Think of includes as library’s, and it doesn’t take long before your making your own scripts. I’m sure you’ll do fine.</p>
<p>I think <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,24824.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this(made by me :P)(Clicky)</a> tutorial should explain things pretty well for you.</p>

<p>I personally don’t know SCAR too well, but I got the basics down quite quickly. There are many guides around to help you get started with SCAR. It is different from C and PHP, but all languages have similarities and with your givin experience you should find it easy to learn(in my opinion).</p>
