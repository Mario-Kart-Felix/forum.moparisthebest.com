    <title>Adding a specific item from inventory to bank</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-a-specific-item-from-inventory-to-bank/520003</link>
    <description>EDIT:
nvm i found fix lol... in itemassistant command in there called &quot;additemtobank&quot; 
i wonder if theres a way to make it take an item out of bank like the opposite of this?
if anyone could figure this out it would help me a lot




kinda like ::bankall but instead i want it just to bank a certain item in the inventory
i tried changing this

&lt;blockquote&gt;for(int i = 0; i &lt; c.playerItems.length; i++) {
				c.getItems().bankItem(c.playerItems[i], i,c.playerItemsN[i]);&lt;/blockquote&gt;
but i just could not find out how it works it just wouldnt work with anything i tried to do.</description>
