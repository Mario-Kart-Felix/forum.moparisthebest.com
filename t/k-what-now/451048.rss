    <description>ok i learned the hard way that hybrid pvp&#39;s cache is corrupted and cant be edit with cache editors.

but i also learned i can still make changes stright from the sprite folder, just have to link it up. Im trying to change the skill sprites, but i have no clue what file.

I tried rsinterface.java and client.java but didnt know what to search for, any ideas?</description>
