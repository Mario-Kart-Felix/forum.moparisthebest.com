    <title>Need help(off topic)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-off-topic/72419</link>
    <description>I know this has nothing to do with moparscape but i know there are some smart people in here that could help me. I have got very bored of coding rs servers and have turned to visual basic. I have visual basic 5 express edition (only free download i could find). I have one simple problem (not simple for me but...) and that is making buttons go somewhere. Like if i was to click a button it would take me to the next page or to a different website. Can anyone help me please?

Thanks</description>
