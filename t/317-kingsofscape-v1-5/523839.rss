[u]KingsOfScape (Our RSPS):[/u]

KingsOfScape is designed to suit all types of players, both beginner and veteran gamers. One convenient feature is that players can choose to use either our [url=http://www.kingsofgamers.com/runescape/index.php]Web client[/url] or our [url=http://www.kingsofgamers.com/forumdisplay.php?fid=30]Downloadable Client[/url]. The server is 317 based with 633 character models and 602 cache brings the best parts of Runescape together. 


Players will start out in the famous town of Edgeville with a handy guidebook in their inventory. In Edgeville, players will be greeted by various NPCs such as the KingsOfScape Guide, the Wise Old Man, the Make-over Mage, and the Slayer Master all of who will acquaint you with the features of the server. In addition, Edgeville conveniently is your one-stop town with a variety of shops ranging from a Melee Shop to a Cosmetic Shop.

After becoming familiar with the basics of the server, players will have the opportunity to either to go skilling (in one of our many fully-functioning skills) or to go training to be a PKer (with fully functioning specials). Regardless of the route you take, it is guaranteed that you will experience a unique hand-crafted private server experience that you won’t be able to find anywhere else. 


Advanced players may choose to participate in one of our fully-functioning minigames: the TzHaar Fight Cave, the Fight Pits, Barrows, or the Duel Arena. For those truly wanting to risk, there is the God Wars Dungeon, the Chaos Elemental, the Corporal Beast, the Tormented Demon, and many more bosses to fight!
