    <title>[Help] Can&#39;t run the game. [Take a Look]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-cant-run-the-game-take-a-look/451626</link>
    <description>Okay, I had a problem with the compiler and I had a friend help me out (thank you very much!)

but then the game won&#39;t run. Meaning that when i log in, it says, error connecting to server.
I made sure the client.java was good and the no-ip is all set. umm idk what else but if someone can help me out that would be awesome. thanks.

i also have teamview and skype</description>
