    <title>Jagex&#39;s Obfuscation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jagexs-obfuscation/144924</link>
    <description>So, this topic might at a glance be similar to that of the one asking whether the public needs deobs, but we arent the public, are we? :)

After doing a little bit of research into different bytecode manipulation libraries, I came across Soot. But what I did not expect to find among their existing transformers were some, similarities?, to what I have noticed inside the runescape client itself.

Simply put, one comment seems to have struck pay dirt
&lt;blockquote&gt;// when shifting, add multiple of 32 or 64 to the shift value, since it will
// have no effect
// shift negatively to confuse things further?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sure, it may not seem like much, but it had me thinking. It is plausible that jagex use the Soot framework as a means of creating their obfuscation.

Simply put, Soot was written for these sorts of manipulations, Jimple makes optimising easier, so needless to say, it makes anything easier.

I will be looking into this much more when I have the time available, I honestly believe that any system using Soot will have a lengthy lifespan. That said, too much precise information given out may possibly have negative outcomes.

I will definitely create something using this, if anyone wishes to tag along for the ride, I will probably share with you so that we may all learn ;) However I will not be releasing any code to the community for the sake of building myself up, it will only decrease the lifespan of said library and bring more unwanted people, though I may release refactored deobs</description>

as i know literally nothing on this subject i am curious does it mean that if the value were say 4 as the example it would add mulitple of 32 so lets say for ease 320 to it so the value would then become 324? is that what it means or am i way off track?<br>
[/quote]what the fuck are you talking about</p>
<p>edit: i just woke up<br>
say you have<code>int i = j &lt;&lt; 4;</code> yes, you can obfuscate the real shit value by adding a multiple of 32 to it, in your case, 320, because the vm clamps the range on the shift by the maximum number of bit places<code>int i = j &lt;&lt; 324;</code><br>
there seems to be very little point to this obfuscation though because it takes longer to insert than it does to remove[/quote]<br>
ah i see thanks for clearing that up</p>

<p>if i had a lot of time on my hands the best option would be to invert the if then normalize the operands to the if instruction in a separate operation which would take the order of method execution into account</p>

<p>it shows how you would go about simplifying the not obfuscation using an AST, the red is changed info<br>
