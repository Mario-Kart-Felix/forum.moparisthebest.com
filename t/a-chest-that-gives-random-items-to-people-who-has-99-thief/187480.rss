          <blockquote>
              <p>First of all, you’ll need to make a case for the chest.  The case is placed like so:</p>
<p><code>
case chestIDnumberhere:
break;</code></p>
<p>The ‘case chestIDnumberhere:’ opens the case, basically saying “What’s in between me and break is what’s gonna happen when this is clicked.”  Whereas the ‘break;’ closes the case, saying “Well case, you bitch, whatever happened between us is over!”</p>
<p>Okay.  Now that you’ve got the case thing covered, you should find out where to put it, right?  Well, you need to put it next to all of its compadres underneath this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">switch(objectID) {</code></pre>
<p>Now, once it’s under there, you need to put something in it, for something to happen obviously.  But- since you want random items to be granted to the player, you’ll have to do some foundation work first.</p>
<p>So, we pick up our trowels and head on over to Site B, AKA item.Java.  Once opened, you’ll see a lot of text which you can’t comprehend, and which you’re not interested in.  So search for one of the following:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">	public static int randomCape()
	{
		return capes[(int)(Math.random()*capes.length)];
	}
	public static int randomBoots()
	{
		return boots[(int)(Math.random()*boots.length)];
	}
	public static int randomGloves()
	{
		return gloves[(int)(Math.random()*gloves.length)];
	}</code></pre>
<p>You should find atleast one of them.  If not, then search for the key word, ‘random’.  That’ll jump you right down to the lot of them.</p>
<p>Now, we’re gonna add the thingy that makes the chest give us random items!  But not completely- oh no, it’s not that easy!  Well… it is, but you know what I mean.  So we’re gonna make our own.  Say you wanted random rare items, you’d do something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">	public static int randomRareItem()
	{
		return RareItem[(int)(Math.random()*RareItem.length)];
	}</code></pre>
<p>Why would you name it RareItem?  Well, simply so that it’s easy to find and recognize in later stages.  Anyway… let’s get back on track.  Now that we’ve done that, we have to add another int, to tell this int which items to produce, 'cause he’s kinda stupid.</p>
<p>So, we pick up our mortar with our bare hands- which is weird -and head on over to Site C, AKA item2.Java.  If you don’t have item2 and have item3 instead (Which is quite idiotic) you can go in there instead.  We’ll call that Site GJ.</p>
<p>Okayy, so we’re in.  You should see something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public static int runerock[] = {451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,1481,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451,451};

    {
    	return KBD[(int)(Math.random()*KBD.length)];
    }	</code></pre>
<p>If you don’t see that, then I don’t know, it’ll be similar anyway.  Uhm, yeah!  We’re gonna make our own now!  Remember I said that we need to make another int, to inform the other int what items to make when it’s called upon (In this scenario, the int’s gonna be called in a case, or the chest’s case to be more specific)?  Well, we’re gonna do that now.  Make your own with something similar to this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public static int RareItem[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,...};</code></pre>
<p>Let’s just assume 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 were all rare item’s identification numbers, those are what you’d put in.  Now remember, I’m not telling you to put in rare items, but you did say it was for 99 Thieving, so ya know.  Whatever items please you.</p>
<p>Oh and, the more items you add in, the less chance you have of getting one of them (1 item 100%, 2 items 50%, 4 items 25% chance, etc).</p>
<p>Now that we’ve done all of that (PHEW), we’re gonna go back to the case, where we began.  Site A, if you will.  Just go back and search for the ID number of the chest in client.Java, and you should jump straight to it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Now, inside the case, you have to call the int.  Which I shamefully and unfortunately have forgotten how to do.  Perhaps someone could fill him in?</span></p>
