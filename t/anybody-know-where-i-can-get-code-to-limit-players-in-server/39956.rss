    <title>Anybody know where i can get code to limit players in server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anybody-know-where-i-can-get-code-to-limit-players-in-server/39956</link>
    <description>im currently running a server, which is based on pimpscape,
and its gotten to the point where whenever i have over 20 people [yes, my pc stinks] the lag is awful...
ive been looking for 2 days on here for a code which does this [limit players], and am untriumphant, rofl
could anybody possibly point me in the right direction? =)

              <p>well yeah, but its got to the point where theres so many people, that it doesnt matter if if ban them, and ipban etc, because theres more people ready to fill the server up and lag it, lool<br>
=[</p>
<p>edit: also, please dont just tell me to go into playerhandler.java and to change the bit that says MAXPLAYERS = 200<br>
if i make that 20, the server crashes when people try to log on above 19… lol</p>
