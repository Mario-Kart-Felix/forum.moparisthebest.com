<p>I have been playing for a few weeks now (including tonight obviously shortly after you stopped playing), on a POS slow ass little Acer laptop and I have never had any problems with lag, at all.</p>
<p>Also, how exactly do you know it was matt that ‘jumped on a bunch of chars’ to make the server look populated? I have never seen matt on any character other than ‘Matt’. What were a few of the names of these chars he jumped on if you don’t mind me asking.</p>

<p>Might want to that computer checked. I don’t lag a bit… Maybe pay more then $20 a month for your internet that helps.</p>
<p>And for the Matt logging in on accounts. Never seen him do it before so doubtful.</p>
<p>And for people treating the new players like trash?? I have never… Guess someone decided they’d log on the server and bum for free shit and you didn’t get it is what I’m assuming so you decide to bash.</p>
