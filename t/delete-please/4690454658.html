<p>Why ban people for duping instead of fixing the dupes?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Thank you, although i wasnt even banned for duping lmao! i was banned because i told him he couldnt make us wait half an hour for an event thinking its 1v1 then once we’re all summoned and ready change it to ffa. Thats the reason i got banned haha!</p>
<p>Admin is a tool, server is basic as shit… can still range through walls, dupe etc…</p>
<p>Oh and the best part of this whole story is… When i first played the server, knowing it was easyrsc based i tested for the dupe. I voluntarily told the admin about the dupe yet he did nothing about it.</p>
<p>If you like basic servers with no playerbase or economy or anything worthwhile playing for then COME PLAY CLASSICFUN.</p>

Ok, so now this is where i have to make a post.<br>
Disregard what this inspectah kid says, he found a glitch-abused it- <span class="bbcode-b">told me about it</span> and that he wouldn’t do it- <span class="bbcode-b">then a week later he is doing it</span>,so i wiped his items and then he did it again.(not a guy of his word)  I made it clear why would you take an unfair advantage over other players when the game is already simple as it is to get items and have fun.  Now that you have gone way out of your way to be a Negative(when in a previous post on this topic you were all for this server), you are Banned.</p>
<p>Everyone else we have Double Experience Rate for the Weekend in the wilderness for new players to obtain levels even faster, there may be an Event, And there is now a Highscores type of a system for people who like to compete for the top skilling spot <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyae52.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> good day<br>
[/quote]Why the hell was it not fixed a week later? That’s entirely your fault.[/quote]<br>
Well Im not positive exactly how long it was, but i was busy and i made sure that it went through and deleted any items they came about from this.</p>

There was one person who knew of the dupe, i kept track of Everything that happened and acted accordingly to those resposible for abusing a glitch(mind you there isnt just a ban for doing it there were several warnings).  For the circumstances I did not have to act immedietly, but it is fixed now and thats what matters.  There aren’t any unfair advantages gained by players because like i said it was dealt with. Thank you for your concern.</p>

<p>Furthermore, how could you be certain that only 1 person knows about it? How do you know others couldn’t figure it out, I mean, they did have a week… Also, how could you keep track of everything? There is no way you log everything in enough detail to track all the items.</p>

<p>ok codeforfame whoever you are i am done talking to you over this issue, if you read my post i said i don’t know exactly how long it was. good day get over it, it is now fixed.[/quote]The point is that it was much longer than a few minutes/hours. A dupe is completely game breaking, and should be fixed immediately.</p>

My unbiased and golden opinion:</p>
<p>Players should not be blamed or punished for the shortcomings of the Programmers/Developers. Anyone who wishes to have an advantage over the competition would naturally abuse the Glitch.</p>

<p>He was told not to do something with more than one warning, so this is why he is banned.  I think it is fair to give someone at least 3 chances before a Ban.  Also,he was trying to use telling the dupe to people - against staff members to get what he wanted = not going to be tolerated.

You need to get over it, and yourself.[/quote]The bug is fixed, sure, but the actual issue isn’t… He didn’t fix a completely game breaking bug, after being informed, for an entire week.  Even you should be able to understand how retarded that is…</p>

<p>I told you that I am one person, and if you saw or thought there was a glitch or bug then post it on the forums.  I was busy when you wanted something done “now”.  You never made a post or attempt to, so that i could see all that you said you experienced.  It’s ok if you Don’t want to do it that way then it can never be fixed. I always try and look at or implement all suggestions, But it needs to be done the correct way.</p>
<p>ps-Sorry you are not talking to your mom that will do Everything exactly when you say it. something.</p>
