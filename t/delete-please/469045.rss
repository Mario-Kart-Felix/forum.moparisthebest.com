<p>Might want to that computer checked. I don’t lag a bit… Maybe pay more then $20 a month for your internet that helps.</p>
<p>And for the Matt logging in on accounts. Never seen him do it before so doubtful.</p>
<p>And for people treating the new players like trash?? I have never… Guess someone decided they’d log on the server and bum for free shit and you didn’t get it is what I’m assuming so you decide to bash.</p>

<p>I have been playing for a few weeks now (including tonight obviously shortly after you stopped playing), on a POS slow ass little Acer laptop and I have never had any problems with lag, at all.</p>
<p>Also, how exactly do you know it was matt that ‘jumped on a bunch of chars’ to make the server look populated? I have never seen matt on any character other than ‘Matt’. What were a few of the names of these chars he jumped on if you don’t mind me asking.</p>

<p>I’ve known you for a while from previous servers, please do not come on here to bash my server.  If you can’t handle simple talk then thats on you(there is always trash talk on RSC).  That is cool if you do not want to play.  Im trying to make this server better as i go.<br>
Fixed: maging and ranging through walls, npcs facing you when you talk, npc talk visible to players around the area, you get attacked when maging and ranging npc’s now.<br>

Has anyone ever actually cared that you’ve called them “retarded” before? That’s your opinion, and I’ve already established that your opinion means less than dog shit…</p>
<p>I’m tired of talking to you. You’re not going to understand that you’re a jackass. My time is being wasted. I’m gonna show you how to walk away, since clearly you don’t know how or when to.</p>

<p>I can play with my imagination all day long, but at the end of the day we’re talking about a “fun server” with ~20 players.</p>
<p>That’s your opinion. He could have just been lazy or just couldn’t get around to it until he did. It doesn’t mean that he couldn’t fix the bug, because if he couldn’t fix it, it wouldn’t be fixed right this very second…</p>
<p>So someone said “stupid” things? What were these “stupid” things? I’m curious as to what you would call “stupid” so that you could justify making a fool out of yourself…[/quote]I never questioned his ability to fix it. If you weren’t mentally retarded you’d see that. His judgement is completely off, and his priorities are wrong. You shouldn’t be hosting events fora week while there is a dupe floating around.</p>
<p>Also, if you don’t recognize what I consider stupid, you are literally retarded. I make it very clear.</p>

<p>Dude It’s not a multi-million person game. I think you’re just trying to entertain yourself or something. He has checked every account on the game. It’s all clean. I really don’t see why you are making a big deal of this.</p>
<p>He has a life, Weather he was busy or just didn’t find it too big of a deal. He has made sure people did not mass rare’s etc. Obviously no one on the server has mined great amounts of coal or fish a shit ton of fish… It would be obvious if someone duped the shit out of stuff.</p>
<p>Oi I’m trying to drink and i keep reading the stupid shit you say. Buzz kill much?[/quote]It doesn’t matter how many users there are; the principle still applies. Also, if I dupe some runes, how the hell would you know? Someone could have duped a full set of rune a few time, and it still looks legit.</p>
<p>He was running events instead of fixing a dupe… It’s not that he was busy, it’s that he didn’t think a dupe was important enough to fix.</p>

<p>No one cares if you find it unacceptable. Not a soul on this Earth cares. You keep repeating yourself over and over like what you say should matter. It doesn’t…</p>
<p>It’s his business how he runs his server. If he wants to wait a week, or a year to fix a bug, that’s his business. Who cares what you think? Certainly not him… He’s not listening to you because it’s none of your business.<br>
I know it’s hard for you to let things go. Ever since I’ve been around you, you’ve had some sort of issue about walking away. Now is the time to get over that and drop it…</p>

lmfao this server was good til i saw the glitches on it and its easy rsc based so its simple how to fix most of it wow i cant believe how much they all rather do an event then take 10 minutes out ur life to fix it. why would anyone play this server. sorry but even project rsc was better then this before i got tired of it<br>

I told you that I am one person, and if you saw or thought there was a glitch or bug then post it on the forums.  I was busy when you wanted something done “now”.  You never made a post or attempt to, so that i could see all that you said you experienced.  It’s ok if you Don’t want to do it that way then it can never be fixed. I always try and look at or implement all suggestions, But it needs to be done the correct way.</p>
<p>ps-Sorry you are not talking to your mom that will do Everything exactly when you say it. something.[/quote]</p>
<p>Lol you are on the server still playing, looks like you chose to be a positive <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> Good to See.  I Always look at all suggestions and I will try my best to make the server enjoyable. First they need to be posted.  Everyone else Check us out and have some Fun, people are staking and semi pking so far.</p>
