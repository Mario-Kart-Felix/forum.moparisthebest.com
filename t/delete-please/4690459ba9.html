I told you that I am one person, and if you saw or thought there was a glitch or bug then post it on the forums.  I was busy when you wanted something done “now”.  You never made a post or attempt to, so that i could see all that you said you experienced.  It’s ok if you Don’t want to do it that way then it can never be fixed. I always try and look at or implement all suggestions, But it needs to be done the correct way.</p>
<p>ps-Sorry you are not talking to your mom that will do Everything exactly when you say it. something.[/quote]</p>
<p>Lol you are on the server still playing, looks like you chose to be a positive <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyae52.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> Good to See.  I Always look at all suggestions and I will try my best to make the server enjoyable. First they need to be posted.  Everyone else Check us out and have some Fun, people are staking and semi pking so far.</p>

<p>I can play with my imagination all day long, but at the end of the day we’re talking about a “fun server” with ~20 players.</p>
<p>That’s your opinion. He could have just been lazy or just couldn’t get around to it until he did. It doesn’t mean that he couldn’t fix the bug, because if he couldn’t fix it, it wouldn’t be fixed right this very second…</p>
<p>So someone said “stupid” things? What were these “stupid” things? I’m curious as to what you would call “stupid” so that you could justify making a fool out of yourself…</p>

<p>Dude It’s not a multi-million person game. I think you’re just trying to entertain yourself or something. He has checked every account on the game. It’s all clean. I really don’t see why you are making a big deal of this.</p>
<p>He has a life, Weather he was busy or just didn’t find it too big of a deal. He has made sure people did not mass rare’s etc. Obviously no one on the server has mined great amounts of coal or fish a shit ton of fish… It would be obvious if someone duped the shit out of stuff.</p>
<p>Oi I’m trying to drink and i keep reading the stupid shit you say. Buzz kill much?</p>

<p>I can play with my imagination all day long, but at the end of the day we’re talking about a “fun server” with ~20 players.</p>
<p>That’s your opinion. He could have just been lazy or just couldn’t get around to it until he did. It doesn’t mean that he couldn’t fix the bug, because if he couldn’t fix it, it wouldn’t be fixed right this very second…</p>
<p>So someone said “stupid” things? What were these “stupid” things? I’m curious as to what you would call “stupid” so that you could justify making a fool out of yourself…[/quote]I never questioned his ability to fix it. If you weren’t mentally retarded you’d see that. His judgement is completely off, and his priorities are wrong. You shouldn’t be hosting events fora week while there is a dupe floating around.</p>
<p>Also, if you don’t recognize what I consider stupid, you are literally retarded. I make it very clear.</p>

<p>Dude It’s not a multi-million person game. I think you’re just trying to entertain yourself or something. He has checked every account on the game. It’s all clean. I really don’t see why you are making a big deal of this.</p>
<p>He has a life, Weather he was busy or just didn’t find it too big of a deal. He has made sure people did not mass rare’s etc. Obviously no one on the server has mined great amounts of coal or fish a shit ton of fish… It would be obvious if someone duped the shit out of stuff.</p>
<p>Oi I’m trying to drink and i keep reading the stupid shit you say. Buzz kill much?[/quote]It doesn’t matter how many users there are; the principle still applies. Also, if I dupe some runes, how the hell would you know? Someone could have duped a full set of rune a few time, and it still looks legit.</p>
<p>He was running events instead of fixing a dupe… It’s not that he was busy, it’s that he didn’t think a dupe was important enough to fix.</p>

<p>I was going to play for fun a few days a week like I use to but I changed my mind after meeting one of your main players M e r c y, have fun playing a dead server with a douche running around telling new players to “gtfo” smart move.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’ve known you for a while from previous servers, please do not come on here to bash my server.  If you can’t handle simple talk then thats on you(there is always trash talk on RSC).  That is cool if you do not want to play.  Im trying to make this server better as i go.<br>
Fixed: maging and ranging through walls, npcs facing you when you talk, npc talk visible to players around the area, you get attacked when maging and ranging npc’s now.<br>
If you like rsc without having to train 50hrs to get a pker or skill then check us out <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
