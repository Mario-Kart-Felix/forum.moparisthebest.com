    <description>Okay, I know I haven&#39;t been active lately, but I&#39;m back with a question. Is being addicted to basketball bad? I got NBA 2K12 and play it for an hour or two, then I go outside and play basketball. Then, my mom comes and always says, &quot;Your always addicted to everything you touch.&quot; But really, is basketball bad to be addicted to? Heck, I only do Basketball for 3 - 4 hours and she makes a huge deal about it. So is it really that bad to be addicted to a sport?</description>

Okay, I know I haven’t been active lately, but I’m back with a question. Is being addicted to basketball bad? I got NBA 2K12 and play it for an hour or two, then I go outside and play basketball. Then, my mom comes and always says, “Your always addicted to everything you touch.” But really, is basketball bad to be addicted to? Heck, I only do Basketball for 3 - 4 hours and she makes a huge deal about it. So is it really that bad to be addicted to a sport?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>NBA 2k12 for ps3 or what?<br>
But 3-4 hours per day isn’t bad, if you were doing 6-8 hours per day it would be too much, Because everyone needs rest and you will be overdoing yourself.<br>
I Myself used to play Basketball for 3-4 hours per day everyday besides the weekends, since those were my resting days.<br>
But keep it up man, and tell your mom, atleast <span class="bbcode-b">I’m not out doing drugs and getting females pregnant, so you shouldn’t really complain about me doing something constructive in my life.</span>[/quote]</p>
<p>basketball isn’t any more constructive than doing drugs or getting ‘females pregnant’ though, it’s a sport, a leisure activity, it serves no constructive purpose bar entertainment</p>

              <p>Okay, I know I haven’t been active lately, but I’m back with a question. Is being addicted to basketball bad? I got NBA 2K12 and play it for an hour or two, then I go outside and play basketball. Then, my mom comes and always says, “Your always addicted to everything you touch.” But really, is basketball bad to be addicted to? Heck, I only do Basketball for 3 - 4 hours and she makes a huge deal about it. So is it really that bad to be addicted to a sport?</p>
