    <title>TryScape (NEW PROJECT!)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tryscape-new-project/24577</link>
    <description>Hi, The Real Java here, i was thinking of making a new project called TryScape using a TestScape source. We will need about 2 more coders. If you know Java and would like to help post, but remember...No newbie&#39;s who don&#39;t know java... If you would like to help it would be a great example to post a tut that you have done..This will be a source not a server unless once it has been done people can make there own server using this source...And everyone who takes part in this will be given credit.

[s]We need 2 more coders... If i have accepted you as a good coder add ~ Skater_Ry@hotmail.co.uk ~ to msn. Look forward to working with you.[/s]

Thanks
