    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-different-login-box/422279</link>
    <description>Okay I&#39;m currently trying add new log in box to my client not exactly sure which one it&#39;s from I&#39;ll add a picture at the bottom the exact problem is it doesn&#39;t come out right when the client finishes loading if anyone could tell me how to change it around in order to make it work i would greatly appreciate it.

Edit: If anyone needs a picture of how the client looks when I try to add the log in box regularly through tom&#39;s cache editor I can upload a picture just request it I can add any extra information you guys may need.</description>
