              <p>To <span class="bbcode-i">make</span> sure what you called “done all the steps” is what I’m thinking, I will ask what you’ve done.</p>
<p>-Gotten a no-ip?<br>
–Is so, gotten the box checked and updated?<br>
-Opened a port in you firewall?<br>
–If so, did you use the default port 43594 and set it as a TCP?<br>
-Portforwaded (If you have a wireless router which allows a network and have multiple computers connected)<br>
–If so, how did you port forward?<br>
-Set your server to the default port? (43595) Accessed at server.java</p>
<p>Think that’s it… Any of those that you didn’t do? If you did then obviously you did something wrong.</p>
