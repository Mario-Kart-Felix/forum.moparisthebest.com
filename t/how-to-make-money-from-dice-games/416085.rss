<p>Yea I understand that, and I agree. Your chances aren’t 50%. But how would that mean you lose more money, when your chances of winning and losing money are still the same (even if they are less than 50%)</p>

</aside>
<p>Perhaps saying it as losing more money was a bad way of putting it. But what I’m saying is, just like a 1:1 system, even if the number of wins to loses eventually averages out, you <span class="bbcode-b">may</span> end up losing more than you win because of the idea you most likely bet more and more everytime you win and lose to try and make the big bucks.</p>
<p>Give, for example, a system where, regardless of the odds, you always bet the same amount. You should always end up with the same money stack after a theoretical even number of scenarios. I’m talking more along the lines of the betters downfall than anything else.</p>
<p>I probably seem super inconsistent here, lol. I’m just saying, I never took stats. I just figured this all out on my calculator one day, don’t crucify me. D:</p>

</aside>
<p>PRNGs are based on patterns, but they are so arbitrary it would take a lot of genius to actually derive some sort of logical pattern, especially when your account alone is probably only receiving a mere fraction of the output of the PRNG on the particular machine the server which you are connected to is running upon.</p>
<p>Also noting, there should be no misconception that odds change between rolls. If you roll a 2, you have the same odds of rolling another 2, and another, and so on.</p>

<p>Noting to people: looking up how dicing odds works is very beneficial. For example, it is statistically favorable to roll a 7 above all other combinations of 2 6-sided dice rolls.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t agree with that. I could be a real arse and talk about how imperfect pseudo-random number generation is, but in the long run, it is pseudo random after all. It’s the best we can do. (and in further technicality, it’s probably more random than actually rolling dice in real life)</p>

(And in the other thread it sounded like you were saying people shouldn’t dice because they had a higher chance of losing than winning, which is what I disagreed with)</p>

<p>But it isn’t a simple ratio lol. That’s the part you aren’t understanding.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/dice-play/Odds.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this website</a>, “Odds are the ratio between the number of winning possibilities and the total number of all remaining possibilities.” This is why I said it isn’t a simple ratio. It’s a ratio between the winning possibilities and the total number of all <span class="bbcode-b">remaining</span> possibilities. As I have said in countless posts earlier, the remaining possibilities are not only losing. This is probability theory.</p>
