    <description>I am completly sure that i did everything right.

when i use a client made by some1 else, and i have a source running, then i can log into it. I can make my self mod. admin. owner and what not so i know its my server. When i push the log in button, it says its logging in to 127.0.0.1, which is the local server i think. 

How do i make it so other people can play on my server. i already did all that portforwarding stuff. Please help

Do i need to hard code my ip into the client.java file, release that, then maybe some1 will be able to get on?

              <p>in your client look for a file called EGUI go in there and you should see something like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">"", "", "", or "127.0.0.1", "127.0.0.1", "127.0.0.1"</code></pre>
<p>If it is the first one just add you ip between the “”. And if it is the second one just delete the 127.0.0.1 and change it to your ip.</p>
