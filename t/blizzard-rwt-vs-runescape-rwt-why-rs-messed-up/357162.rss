    <description>[b]Blizzard&#39;s ToS[/b]

[url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/antigold.html]http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/antigold.html[/url]

I am posting this link because it relates to Runescape&#39;s RWT.

If you read the topic it says basically to watch out for RWTing, and how selling gold/items/characters is against their ToS.

Now I checked their ToS([url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/legal/termsofuse.html]http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/legal/termsofuse.html[/url]), it states(on rule 11), that if a user sells anything from their game, they are not responsible for it what so ever. They do not recognize these types of transfer at all, and everything in the game is considered their property. And you ALSO are agreeing you have no entitlement to anything and everything in the game.


[b]Runescape&#39;s ToS.[/b]
[url=http://www.runescape.com/terms/terms.ws]http://www.runescape.com/terms/terms.ws[/url]

Now under &quot;our rights&quot; [b]If you are possibly RWTing[/b]: Jagex has access to your account, and everything involving your account such as items, stats, ect. Meaning at any point in time they feel like you are breaking a RWT rule, or when they feel like it, they have the right to reset stats, and take your money [b]AND TAKE YOUR MEMBERSHIP AWAY.[/b]

Under their ToS, it says they have the right to change their ToS at any time, without notifying anyone, and it is basically your right to keep up with the changing of it.

That would be the only thing said about RWTing (I could find in ToS).


[b]LETS COMPARE[/b]

Now comparing Blizzard&#39;s ToS, and Runescape ToS. 

We all know why Blizzard still has aloud this to happen. Basically if the &quot;credit card companies&quot; TRY and sue Blizzard, they will whip out their ToS saying, that the owner has no right to sell their property, and they were not aware the player was doing this, so therefore the right of a &quot;charge back of money (from the CC company)&quot; is therefore invalid.

What Runescape did, changed the game forever. They took out every possible way to transfer money. And at that time they needed to act fast, because Credit Card companies were charging back money Jagex could not supply them with. So instead of just changing the ToS, saying that its their property, ect ect (like Blizzard), they decided to just destroy what makes their game. If only they changed their ToS, maybe they could bring back what the game once was.

People CAN still RWT, as just look at the sites that are still up. 


Also from what I don&#39;t understand, the quite known site &quot;Rsbot.org&quot; was taken down for having the copyrighted name of &quot;RS&quot; meaning &quot;Runescape&quot; 
Why can jagex not just use the same copyright law with the other gold trading sites?


Discuss, post if I posted any errors.</description>

<p>I am posting this link because it relates to Runescape’s RWT.</p>
<p>If you read the topic it says basically to watch out for RWTing, and how selling gold/items/characters is against their ToS.</p>
<p>Now I checked their ToS(<a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/legal/termsofuse.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/legal/termsofuse.html</a>), it states(on rule 11), that if a user sells anything from their game, they are not responsible for it what so ever. They do not recognize these types of transfer at all, and everything in the game is considered their property. And you ALSO are agreeing you have no entitlement to anything and everything in the game.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Runescape’s ToS.</span><br>
<a href="http://www.runescape.com/terms/terms.ws" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.runescape.com/terms/terms.ws</a></p>
<p>Now under “our rights” <span class="bbcode-b">If you are possibly RWTing</span>: Jagex has access to your account, and everything involving your account such as items, stats, ect. Meaning at any point in time they feel like you are breaking a RWT rule, or when they feel like it, they have the right to reset stats, and take your money <span class="bbcode-b">AND TAKE YOUR MEMBERSHIP AWAY.</span></p>
<p>Under their ToS, it says they have the right to change their ToS at any time, without notifying anyone, and it is basically your right to keep up with the changing of it.</p>
<p>That would be the only thing said about RWTing (I could find in ToS).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">LETS COMPARE</span></p>
<p>Now comparing Blizzard’s ToS, and Runescape ToS.</p>
<p>We all know why Blizzard still has aloud this to happen. Basically if the “credit card companies” TRY and sue Blizzard, they will whip out their ToS saying, that the owner has no right to sell their property, and they were not aware the player was doing this, so therefore the right of a “charge back of money (from the CC company)” is therefore invalid.</p>
<p>What Runescape did, changed the game forever. They took out every possible way to transfer money. And at that time they needed to act fast, because Credit Card companies were charging back money Jagex could not supply them with. So instead of just changing the ToS, saying that its their property, ect ect (like Blizzard), they decided to just destroy what makes their game. If only they changed their ToS, maybe they could bring back what the game once was.</p>
<p>People CAN still RWT, as just look at the sites that are still up.</p>
<p>Also from what I don’t understand, the quite known site “<a href="http://Rsbot.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Rsbot.org</a>” was taken down for having the copyrighted name of “RS” meaning “Runescape”<br>
Why can jagex not just use the same copyright law with the other gold trading sites?</p>
<p>Discuss, post if I posted any errors.</p>
