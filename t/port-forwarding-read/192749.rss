    <title>Port Forwarding - READ!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/port-forwarding-read/192749</link>
    <description>Ok, I&#39;ve already opened up ports on my other router, but now that I switched because of real-life problems, I can&#39;t get my new one to open one up! It&#39;s so frustrating and I&quot;m sure I&#39;m typing in the same thing as I did with my other one. I&#39;m using linksys and I was using D-Link. Here is to show you what I have typed in.

In the black, I have my &quot;IPv4 Address.&quot; Does any one see a single thing wrong with this? Plus, my no-ip is updated to my IP and I&#39;m pretty sure it isn&#39;t the no-ip.


If you got any ideas what so ever on what it could be, pm me please or post. Thanks!
