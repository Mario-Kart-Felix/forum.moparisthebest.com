    <description>I need help with this source.... I want to know how to fix the passwords. When I type ::getpass and stuff it comes up the players pass is 152-92-37-123-56-234-477-212 and so on. The numbers are different for everone but I need it fixed so I can read the player pass properly. If you can help me out with this a big thanks to you. This could even be made into a tut because I haven&#39;t seen one b4 and I think other ppl are in the same situation as me.</description>
