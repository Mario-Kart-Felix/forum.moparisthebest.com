    <title>IP Spoofing?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ip-spoofing/371750</link>
    <description>Can PHP&#39;s $_SERVER[&#39;REMOTE_ADDR&#39;] be tricked? For example, could I make an administration page which checks that $_SERVER[&#39;REMOTE_ADDR&#39;] equals my own IP address or is it possible for someone to spoof my IP and see the said page?

Programming related so I posted it here.</description>

<p>That isn’t right at all, assuming we are running over TCP (which HTTP does).  With TCP, there is a 3-way handshake that starts the connection:<br>
<img src="http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/diagrams/tcpopen3way.png" alt width="666" height="426"><br>
Obviously the SYN packet can be spoofed (you can tell the server it came from ANY address), but when the server sends the SYN+ACK back to that IP, since that IP didn’t originate it, it will not send an ACK back, and the server drops the connection long before it ever gets anywhere near the HTTP level (since it never gets past the initial TCP setup).</p>
<p>Therefore, it is impossible for anyone to spoof ‘REMOTE_ADDR’, even just sending requests like silab’s quote says.</p>
<p>However, as others have said, you can change REMOTE_ADDR by using proxies, and some ISPs force multiple users to use the same IP, and therefore they would all have the same REMOTE_ADDR.</p>

              <p>Yes, it is exploitable. It is known that the ‘REMOTE_ADDR’ can be spoofed upon request, as stated by Miss Silabsoft, but since the web-server would respond sending the data to the spoofed IP then there’s nothing wrong with using it, right? Wrong.</p>
<p>Suppose player A wants to fuck with player B. He knows that player B’s IP address is 123.123.123.123. Player A can then simply send a spoofed request to the web-server using the IP 123.123.123.123 and the web-server will change the password stored in the database for player A with a dynamically randomly generated one.</p>
<p>Although player B didn’t manage to get player A’s password, he managed to change it.</p>
<p>Also, many people have dynamic IPs. A general rule is that you shouldn’t rely on a user’s IP address for anything other than perhaps a session.</p>

I was going to make it so if their current IP matched the registration IP it would allow them to change the password. I’m not fussed about their own PC being hacked I only cared if my system was exploitable which is appears it is, but if it can’t read the data then it won’t see what the new password is (if I randomly generate it), so surely it’s OK if I do it that way?[/quote]Anyone that has a bro or sister could hack their siblings account really easy…</p>

<p>Im pretty sure they can make a request with the IP address but will not be able to see the response because the response aims back at that IP (Which they dont have) Overall I can say your safe on this method and no worries about a SQL injection.</p>

<p>I had already said no, you cannot get your IP. All I was actually trying to do is warn you about the risks, and better alternatives. For example, even reading a simple .txt file for a password, in a pre-detemined location on your HDD would even work.

<p>That parameter returns the IP of the person who had connected to the server, therefore they can never connect as you unless they somehow get control of your internet, where they can do a lot more than look at your PHP page.</p>
<p>A proxy server WILL send the proxies IP due to the fact that the proxy server is connecting, and then sending it back to the person connected to the proxy server.</p>
