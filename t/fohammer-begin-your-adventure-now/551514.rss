[CENTER]Here at FoHammer, our number one goal is to achieve 100% player-satisfaction. We&#39;ve added numerous new systems, functions, and features, and are about to release our first patch, that&#39;ll be introducing some never seen before content in rsps history, as well as some less common content that&#39;s extremely useful, that&#39;s been seen before. We&#39;re a player based game, we strongly recomend and suggestion players, and staff to give us feedback, and suggestions to help shape their world here. We&#39;ve been working really hard, and we&#39;re working really hard, this is sort of a big project and will be a long-term lasting server. We weren&#39;t going to make the advertisement thread until Patch I was released, but we got really impatient, and we&#39;d figure when it&#39;s released in a few days, we can post in on here in the advert thread, and people will really notice we&#39;re serious, we&#39;re here to get shit done, and the way we&#39;re rewriting all our funtionalitys, methods, and systems is a gianormous improvement from what you&#39;d normally see, ensuring a more lag-free game to enjoy. I&#39;m not giving any information about our patch, If you wanna see some of the things being released, checkout the patch notes on the forum. This may look like every other server at first, but come try us out, and give us a chance, we&#39;ll change your mind, and with Patch I&#39;s release, the game will be ironicly different in vast ways.

[u][b]Some features, and information;[/b][/u]
- Custom Client, with player control panel
- Some models of new armor sets, rebuffed and are being introduced
- All the bosses we have work, and in Patch I&#39;s release there will be at-least 6 new bosses released (that&#39;s what we&#39;ve got currently)
- We created a PvM feature with tormented demons, it&#39;s sort of a mini-quest for players to obtain a armor set
- Adventure logs npc that holds records of your drop logs, npc kills, and player statistics (We&#39;re removing this in-game and putting it onto the website)
- Almost daily updates, but we work on the server everyday, we&#39;re active, and really communicate with the community
- Max cape, Complitionist cape, Quest cape, and Vet Cape obtainable, [u]AND[/u] customizable with particles
- Dice ranks
- Perfect Switching
- All skills work fluently, [b]INCLUDING[/b] Construction and Dungeoneering!
- Player shops
- There&#39;s one current quest released, we have 5 more we&#39;re working on that&#39;ll be introduced in Patch I
- Lottery system, it&#39;s a little different from the normal
- Two cool features for the community to work together to get bonuses (read patch notes_1) 
- There&#39;s tons of donor benefits, donor obtainables, and tons of player-obtainables
- Lots of places to train, fair amount of bosses including some ones we&#39;ve made of our own
- We&#39;re reworking the clan chat system, dungeoneering skill, aswell as adding onto the construction skill, when that&#39;s finished people will be REALLY astonished with our work
- Each donor rank has a boss their accessable to, if you become a higher powered donator you&#39;re able to still access the previous boss you unlocked


Please if you&#39;re not interested, still come give us a shot! Being in-game and experiencing it, may help change your opinion. We&#39;re working really hard to produce something amazing for everyone. Here&#39;s some media, and thanks for reading.

              <p>I have broken away from my team, as my partner Munsor was corrupt, inactive, and not willing to pay his employee’s.<br>
I branched off, and am merging most to all my features and content, into my new project I’ve joined in on with Ahram.<br>
If you’re still waiting for Olympus/Fohammer, It’s released and ready to play, &amp; better than ever. You can download<br>
the launcher from our website: <a href="http://turmoilps.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://turmoilps.net/</a><br>
Our server is exploding with content, and has more coming rapidly. Come get a head start before the server blows up.<br>
Fuck you Munsor, and the Fohammer / Invictus Studio team, I created it, and quit because of you guys.<br>
BTW, I’m RELEASING a FULL copy of MY source (Fohammer / Olympus), with a few features removed, but mostly all the content will be there<br>
so make sure to watch out for it, bringing a new age to RSPS.</p>

              <p>We haven’t been releasing much information on our updates, due to we don’t want people copying some the ideas or content we’re using, atleast until it’s released which is a week away. A day before our release on our website their will be a Patch Note for everyone to read containing all the updates that’ve been done since the shutdown. Last night we begun implimenting a new feature, ‘Refer A Friend’ to help grow our player-base, aswell as giving our players a opportunity to gain some rewards. We have a new server advertisement for when we release, loads of work has been done. I really hope to see some new faces around.</p>

<p>Thanks for both of your feedback’s, we like to not think of any of our items as “customs” but rather regular items.<br>
This last week we’ve REALLY been doing some hardcore work, we started and basically finished our website reconstruction. @ <a href="http://fohammer.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://fohammer.com</a><br>
I’ve gotten a whole new set of professional imagery created for our name-change, we’re currently wrapping everything up for Patch I &amp; II, getting ready to release the game for public play.<br>
We’ve really taken the time to rewrite a lot of code making it more efficient, and making the game engine more smoother. We’ve begun really working on our cache as-well.<br>
We rewriting the launcher right now in C#, that’ll include a Java updater due to having some player-base is coming from outside sources other than RSPS, some the users don’t have Java, as-well with if the launcher is written in Java, it also will not deploy. We’re working on a Highscore page, which admins/owners will not participate in them as they can use the max skill and xp command, unless on a non-staff account, a donation page is soon coming, as-well as a technical support team, and live stream &amp; behind the scenes of us developing this project.<br>
I’m trying to give a little more brief information, so players know we are still working every single day, with consecutive hours being put in, producing a flawless, beautiful, brand new 718, with a extremely steady economy, as-well as a amazing community, a dedicated &amp; friendly staff team, a lag free environment, very very limited to no bugs, if they’re found they’re taken care of instantly. We have a super prime VPS sitting aside waiting for the release. You’ll have to wait for Patch logs to be posted on the website in updates to see a list of everything we’ve done.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, hope to see some new names on forums!</p>

<p>Really appreciate this, I picked 718 because noone is really creating any new methods, content, and functionalities for it<br>
along with no real new content, systems, features, etc. There is something that stumped me and that’s that even with everything this server will contain, players who just plain and simply like the OSRS style, will continue liking it, if that’s their preference they’re going to want to be playing a 317, or something you know? In Patch II, we’re going to be making the client customizable so people can play as they like.</p>

<p>Thank you, greatly appreciate that, and I agree with you.<br>
I would like to annouce my project is experiencing big changes, therefore we’ve shut it down for a month.<br>
Almost a little over 2 weeks have passed since I’ve turned it off due to it not being player-ready.<br>
I’ve been working at a fast paste, me and my developement crew plan to have the game back up within a week, being a week earlier than our planned date. When everyone gets back onto the game there’s going to be some big changes, we’re finishing Patch I, than it’ll be released into the game the same time it’s brought back up. We’re also currently doing a big website reconstruction, for when the server is back online, and the server name has been changed aswell as our Studio name. Be sure to look out for the server advertisement within about a week, and the thread will obviously be created by me. You can checkout <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">some</span></span> of our Patch I update logs on the website &gt; forums<br>

</aside>
<p>New interfaces, bosses, a few new models, and some custom sprites have been added, the server is down for a month developement. Customizable particles for mastercapes, new aura’s with bonuse’s that are obtaininable, we reconstructed the ‘donator’ feature, we’re currently rewriting the game engine, and our launcher in C# incase users that do not have Java try to play the launcher won’t deploy. Where when it’s written in C# we added a Java checker, and updater, so if they don’t have java it’ll install it, and the launcher will still deploy. We’ve reconstructed the home area, completed the grand exchange and created a database for it. We’re working on a better dungeoneering algorytmy, it’ll be really similar to real RuneScape’s dungeoneering system, but we’re adding a new floor base after warped, introducing 10 new floors, with 3 new dungeoneering boss’s. We’ve added a few new pets, some donor, some any player(s) can obtain. We’re reworking the website and forum, and have added a donor panel, mod / administrator panel, and player panel. Regular players, can’t see the mod / admin panel nor can donors. The support rank has their own panel they can also only see. Changed the task system tab(we did many things to it you’ll have to wait for when it’s back online to see :] ). Made the Quest tab normal, moved the quests we have into it, and deleted all of RuneScape’s. In the quest book the quests are clickable, and function like real runescape’s did, with instructions and such on the quest, shows requirements (items &amp; stats), required for the quest. etc. And we started making our client more customizable, for players likings such as you disliking the ‘newer gameframe’, or ‘graphics’, the client will be completely customizable, changable graphics, gameframe, HP bar, hit markers, and such. We also have added a new loading bar for the Launcher, and client as well as a new HP bar, we’re creating our new game-frame now. We have 3 new magic spells being made, 2 new melee special attacks for new wepons, and 2 new range special attacks for a bow than a c-bow. Dragon ore is mine-able, aswell with dragon bars being after to be smelted and smithed into items. There’s alot more coming will keep everyone updated, and will be adding media, and insights of the things you’ll be seeing in the Patch I, and Patch II release<br>
[/quote] Thats a ton of updates (waiting to see them) especially if you added where we can change gameframe? wonder how that would work dont think a higher rev is out there where you can change gameframe would love to see that, would be on your rsps in a jiffy  ;D[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s why we’re adding it ^^ we want our players to enjoy our game, some players may be disapointed seeing the server and it having all the content it does and will, but it being in a reivision their not fond of. With a changeable gameframe and graphics, and such everyone will be able to enjoy our game.</p>

Customizable particles for mastercapes, new aura’s with bonuse’s that are obtaininable, we reconstructed the ‘donator’ feature, we’re currently rewriting the game engine, and our launcher in C# incase users that do not have Java try to play the launcher won’t deploy. Where when it’s written in C# we added a Java checker, and updater, so if they don’t have java it’ll install it, and the launcher will still deploy. We’ve reconstructed the home area, completed the grand exchange and created a database for it. We’re working on a better dungeoneering algorytmy, it’ll be really similar to real RuneScape’s dungeoneering system, but we’re adding a new floor base after warped, introducing 10 new floors, with 3 new dungeoneering boss’s. We’ve added a few new pets, some donor, some any player(s) can obtain. We’re reworking the website and forum, and have added a donor panel, mod / administrator panel, and player panel. Regular players, can’t see the mod / admin panel nor can donors. The support rank has their own panel they can also only see. Changed the task system tab(we did many things to it you’ll have to wait for when it’s back online to see :] ). Made the Quest tab normal, moved the quests we have into it, and deleted all of RuneScape’s. In the quest book the quests are clickable, and function like real runescape’s did, with instructions and such on the quest, shows requirements (items &amp; stats), required for the quest. etc. And we started making our client more customizable, for players likings such as you disliking the ‘newer gameframe’, or ‘graphics’, the client will be completely customizable, changable graphics, gameframe, HP bar, hit markers, and such. We also have added a new loading bar for the Launcher, and client as well as a new HP bar, we’re creating our new game-frame now. We have 3 new magic spells being made, 2 new melee special attacks for new wepons, and 2 new range special attacks for a bow than a c-bow. Dragon ore is mine-able, aswell with dragon bars being after to be smelted and smithed into items. There’s alot more coming will keep everyone updated, and will be adding media, and insights of the things you’ll be seeing in the Patch I, and Patch II release</p>

There’s so many of these copied 718 servers, and sadly i think this is another one.<br>
You may have put some real time in this, but i’d suggest you to invest time in some serious unique content.</p>
<p>Either way goodluck with Fohammer.  ;)[/quote]</p>
<p>Forsure I agree it’s pretty bare right now, we wanted to release the advertisement, than the patch updates.<br>
That way people will see how hard we’re working, see come new and unique features, ones that are uncommon, and less seen<br>
and we have alot of content coming that noone has actually ever seen in a RSPS. This source is a mix between a couple few 718’s that’ve been recently released. It’s very different than most code wise. We work almost everyday atleast 3-8 hours there’s three of us developing. Checkout the patch notes, it explains briefly some of the new content you’ll see and features(There HAS been more added since this was posted); <a href="http://www.fohammer.com/forums/thread-29-post-103.html#pid103" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.fohammer.com/forums/thread-29-post-103.html#pid103</a></p>

<p>The server may be alright, but you as an owner is unstable.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m a good owner, I just was having a really rough day when I flamed you. :\ I’d like to get big, and for those purposes there’s a changeable revision coming as said above, it’ll be super customizable and nice. Thanks for ur support though!</p>
