    <description>Okay I am trying to download The Moparscape 3.2 w/ Aryan and it will not let me. First, i go to google and type in &quot;Moparscape Downloads&quot;, and it brings me to a screen with a bunch of links. I click on the one at the very top and then it takes me to a screen that says &quot;Download the windows MoparScape 3.2 w/ Aryan installer here or here or here AND Click here for the official thread and linux/mac versions. Next, my pal told me to click on the 3rd &quot;here&quot; so I do and then it takes me to a screen that says &quot; Error 404&quot; or something like that. Now this is where I need help becuase after a few seconds, it takes me to this screen that is &quot;UPPIT&quot; and it says that I can browse for something and then it asks me if I agree to all terms and conditions. So what now?</description>
