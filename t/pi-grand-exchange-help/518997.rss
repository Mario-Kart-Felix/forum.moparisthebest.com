    <description>im trying to get ge working in my server it was already coded in halfway and i found some tuts and had some help getting the interfaces up but now the interfaces all come up if i type ::interface #### but when i click the buy or sell buttons it wont change the interface to the buy or sell one ive messed with it and found it to be a problem with the void openInterface in the grandexchange.java heres one of my clicking buttons that uses it that dont work

[CODE]				case 95191:
			selectedSlot = 1;
			openInterface(&quot;Sell&quot;);
			break;[/CODE]

if i use the openInterface method i get a java.lang.NullPointerException error but i need to use that method in order to be able to select items to buy or sell

if i change the openInterface to   c.getPA().showInterface(####);  then it does change the interface to the sell one when but it wont let me select and item to sell because the openInterface void is what lets you select an item so how do i fix this? my grandexchange.java is below i had to put it on pastebin cause its big
