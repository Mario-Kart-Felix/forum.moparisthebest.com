    <title>In need of a professional GFX designer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/in-need-of-a-professional-gfx-designer/428900</link>
    <description>Hey, I&#39;m the developer of a relatively new rsps: Motion-X-Scape and we&#39;ve been through a hell of a lot of gfx designers and we just can&#39;t find one that&#39;s good enough. We are willing to pay 10$ (USD) to a professional gfx designer to make us an animated banner, and a good forums header.

Requirements:

-Must be good.
-Must have skype.
-Must show us some of their previous work before we hire you.

This 10$ payment is only for the 2 gfx&#39;s we are asking for, if by the end of these two, you wish to stay with our server we will give you the rank of GFX Designer.

Please get back to me by either posting on this topic or thorugh skype, my skype user name is - Ruby_Website_Developer

Thanks, Ruby.</description>
