    <description>Well, I want to explore more with a &#39;474&#39; server. I want to try making it so other players can connect but in the Client I get an error with something on the cache loading if I change the IP. I was wondering if there was a renamed 474, so I can add a IP changer possibly..:s

Also, if you have a 474 with a IP changer already, it&#39;d be really nice if you can give it to me :/ I really want to experiment and see how far I can push myself to get a decent 474. O_O</description>
