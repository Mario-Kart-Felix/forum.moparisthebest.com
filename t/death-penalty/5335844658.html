I think that is a great idea, and like I said I agree that improved correctional facilities will benefit America in the long run. However, the problem is that the returns deal in the long run. I don’t think America should be looking at long term benefits of saving money <span class="bbcode-b">at the moment</span>. I also disagree that the prison system should be nationalized. There definitely should be government-run prisons, but it should not be illegal to run a private prison. America is based on entrepreneurship, so if someone found a niche and made a prison, then that is fair game. However, public prisons should be of higher standards to push the private prisons to be at higher standards in order to compete. That is my philosophy for the national healthcare problem too.</p>

Private prisons have no incentive to do a good job, that is why you should outlaw them.<br>
And you should ALWAYS look at the long term effect of politics.</p>

If you incentivise a low recidivism rate (i.e., rewarding prisons that have outgoing prisoners who make 1, 2, and 5 year milestones without reoffending) then private prisons would do a good job. The problem is that the incentive doesn’t currently exist.</p>
<p>Your suggestion isn’t practical. America likes privatisation just as much as they like their guns and carburetor engines.</p>

        <p>Lothy: Lobbyist would always push the government to be nicer to them. Your suggestion might work for a moment until they’re able to push for the laws they want. By removing all private prison you’re also removing the lobbyists. The only problem would be to remove them in the first place, but after that you’re good.</p>

        <p>Politics perhaps, but not economics when your economy is in dire need of help. It’s like the adage penny smart but dollar dumb. Why waste time and energy right now saving pennies and perhaps dollars in the future when you can save dollars right now. You know just as well as I do that no law can easily be passed through congress, especially if it involves private businesses. All of those prisons will lobby against the bill and it will take a lot of time and effort to get that bill passed. Why waste that time and energy when you won’t be getting large returns immediately</p>
<p>And perhaps if you created an incentive then they would. Perhaps if their was an inspection that decided how well a prison was at correcting their inmates and then you would fill the prison with the highest approval rating first. This would be an incentive for private prisons because they receive money based on how many inmates they have.</p>
<p>Or a simpler solution would be to raise the bar for private prisons since they have to sign a contract with the government. If the correctional facilities are not up to par then they do not receieve governmental funding.</p>
<p>And with what you said about lobbying, then that is why we should get rid of lobbying haha. It produces bad legislation. Although I have no idea how it ever could be removed. Only way is if somehow all of congress had a good moral compass and realized lobbying was malignant to our country and abolished it.</p>

        <p>You all act as if every murderer is put under the Death Penalty, when in fact its actually not used as often as you would think. Currently at the correctional facility I work at we only have 2 Death-Row offenders. Only one of which I actually know the crimes to. Want to know? No? Im telling you anyways.</p>
<p>She killed both of her teenage children, then baked her baby in the oven with various sauces and spices. When the baby was done cooking, she took the “meal” to her parents house (the childrens grandmothers) and attempted to feed the baby to them. The grandparents didn’t even know what it was she was trying to feed them until she cut into the baby. - This woman has only been on the DP for a couple years now.</p>
<p>Did you know - It costs an adverage of 35k per year to house an inmate?</p>
<p>Private Prisons - Actually there is an incentive. The state (or federal, depending on who has “ownership” [lack of a better word] of the inmate) pay the private prison to house them.</p>
<p>In my honest opinion. Yes, all states need to have the DP because sometimes its just going to be cheaper in the long run. Remember, being put on death row doesn’t mean you probably wont naturally die in the facility of other causes first. It takes many (ive herd as many as 50) years before you either get released from DP or get executed.</p>

        <p>I’d say no to the death penalty because I don’t see how it helps more than other possibilities i.e. life sentence of doing work in a prison (I think a lot of the paint made in the US is from criminals in prisons?) with our current level of technology. Maybe in the way future we could recondition people to become ‘good’ people i.e. certain traits, memories etc could be removed/modified and I’m sure that could ‘turn’ the person back into a ‘good’ person.</p>
<p>I do believe in certain situations people serving life sentences people should have the option to die though via lethal injection etc because again, it’s a pointless punishment in my opinion.</p>

        <p>[quote=“CoonHunter, post:35, topic:533584”]Did you know - It costs an adverage of 35k per year to house an inmate?[/quote] Did you know it costs on average 1.26 million dollars to execute a single person in Kansas and more in other states? Now considering your average is correct, that is 36 years in jail on average. So unless the person spends more than 36 years in jail, it is cheaper to just lock them up until they die. Yes I know you said 50 years, but that is definitely not the average. Also, if you want to take a person who could be in jail for fifty years, it is nearly the same costs as putting them on death row means you have to house them for those fifty years. So no matter if you put them in jail or death row your tax dollars are paying for them to be housed. Only difference is with the death penalty is they get to repeal and repeal and repeal until there is 100% certainty they are at fault. Why not just lock them up in solitary confinement and be done with it?</p>
<p>[quote=“CoonHunter, post:35, topic:533584”]Yes, all states need to have the DP because sometimes its just going to be cheaper in the long run.[/quote] No no no no no. Look up the facts then come back. It will save yourself the embarrassment.</p>
<p>[quote=“CoonHunter, post:35, topic:533584”]Remember, being put on death row doesn’t mean you probably wont naturally die in the facility of other causes first. It takes many (ive herd as many as 50) years before you either get released from DP or get executed.[/quote] Yes! So why put them on death row if they will just die a normal death as if they were in prison. Only difference, as I stated earlier, is that you have to pay for all of the court cases and repeals and whatnot for the death penalty.</p>
<p>As far as that woman goes, she deserves to be locked up for life, but I am not spending extra money just so people can have their revenge.</p>

The woman in your example is mentally ill, you don’t kill such people.  Private prisons have no incentive to lower the recidivism rate, as that would lessen the demand for prisons.</p>

You make that assumption without any proof. She sees a Phsycological doctor weekly yes, but she has not been diagnosed with anything except post-traumatic stress disorder. All inmates at the correctional facility I work at will see the phsyc doctor at least once a month. Remember, some (like the female) are locked up 24/7 because she will fight just to get her back into her cell, which causes more time in lockdown.</p>
<p>Do not make an assumption about an inmate just by a story you’ve herd. We have a mental “hospital” just down the road about 1.5 miles from the facility I work at. There is very few people who come to prison and need to be transfered over there.</p>
<p>The female was not mentally ill either. She was tired of dealing with her kids. Thats exactly what she will tell you.</p>
