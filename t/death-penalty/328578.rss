    <title>Death Penalty</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/death-penalty/328578</link>
    <description>http://www.freeonlineepisodes.net/bu...death-penalty/

sparked my interest in this topic, they sum it up pretty well.

In any case:

Murdering a murderer is still murder, we are hardwired to preserve humanity and the death penalty conflicts with this.

The death penalty would only make any kind of sense if it were proven to be a deterrent. Not only has no proof been shown, someone in that video makes a pretty good point for it not working as a deterrent.

There are 3 motives for killing in cold blood:

Passion
Compulsion
Profit

Passion and compulsion obviously cannot be deterred. If someone were to kill for profit, they wouldn&#39;t think they are going to get caught.

The death penalty has no advantage over putting someone in jail for the rest of their life. Judges can rule that a person does not get parole, and won&#39;t ever get out.

Unless it can be proven to be a deterrent, there is absolutely no reason to do it. Argue &#39;he deserves it&#39; all you want, but it&#39;s just opinion.

Then you have the benefits of life imprisonment: [url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty]Much much cheaper[/url], they can be put to work to improve society, and if evidence comes up later proving the person&#39;s innocence they can be let out of jail.

There have been many cases where an innocent person has been put on death row, but the numbers really don&#39;t matter.

Even if 1 innocent person is put to death by the legal system, I&#39;m sure anyone can agree that this is enough reason to abolish the death penalty.</description>

              <p>I think I’ve said this before, but I’ll say it again. Most serial killers want to be stopped.

They want to inflict a pain that is far greater then physical pain: the pain caused by realizing that you have killed someone, albeit a murderer.</p>
<p>On of the reasons, if not the main reason, why it’s a firing squad and not one person with a gun is because those in a firing squad don’t know whose bullet actually killed.</p>

              <p>What if you were a father of 2, a boy and a girl. Some guy breaks into your house while your at work and kills your entire family. I’d want him to die and if there was no death penalty i’d want to kill him myself. All im saying is in some scenarios the death penalty stops more murders. But it could also go the other way around e.g someone who is family to the guy kills you for helping sentence his brother.</p>
