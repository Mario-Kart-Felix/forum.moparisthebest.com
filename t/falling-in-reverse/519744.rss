    <title>Falling In Reverse</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/falling-in-reverse/519744</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know how many of you guys listen to Falling In Reverse or pay attention to them. But their new album is out in June. They release a single called &quot;Alone&quot; and they changed their sound. Here&#39;s what they sounded in their first album:

And here&#39;s what they sound like now:

Also, their lead singer, Ronnie Radke, supposedly left. More information about that at: http://mindequalsblown.net/2013/05/18/ronnie-radke-supposedly-walks-out-on-falling-in-reverse/comment-page-1/</description>

              <p>I have been a fan since I heard the first song of ETF (Escape the fate). Ronnie has made some bad moves over and over, but somehow i still like him… His new music style is somewhat good, but not even near the first album of FIR which was beast.</p>
<p>Like 2 weeks ago I was comparing FIR and ETF newest songs, and I must say that ETF has taken the lead! Incredibly good fucking songs. I don’t mean to take over this thread with ETF, but I have to link a song that moved me alot and it’s the best song i heard from them since Ronnie left.</p>
<p>[youtube]<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a3_S-2dA_I%5B/youtube%5D" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a3_S-2dA_I[/youtube]</a></p>
<p>Anyway, I also have to say something about Ronnie, imagine what he’s dealing with everyday, competing with his former friends from ETF and the whole prison part, max green etc etc… Ofc his mode breaks into pieces when his fans try to put him down too!</p>

Their guitarist, Jacky Vincent, is really good. I’m sure he would have gotten somewhere if he hadn’t met Ronnie.</p>

The new song sucks completely, the drastic change in sound makes me want to rip my eyes out. I downloaded the song thinking it would be great without listening to it, i was wrong. Also, apart from him apparently leaving, one of the band members is supposedly about to be deported. They’re currently on a working visa, and as they’ve been removed from the band, looks like no more work.</p>
<p>This whole thing just seems silly though, this song, him leaving, so much drama.[/quote]<br>
Who is ‘supposedly’ going to be deported?</p>

              <p>I’ve been following this, well not really but i’ve been seeing a lot of it on facebook. The new song sucks completely, the drastic change in sound makes me want to rip my eyes out. I downloaded the song thinking it would be great without listening to it, i was wrong. Also, apart from him apparently leaving, one of the band members is supposedly about to be deported. They’re currently on a working visa, and as they’ve been removed from the band, looks like no more work.</p>
<p>This whole thing just seems silly though, this song, him leaving, so much drama.</p>

<p>at the change itself…not really fond of it I think the first one was better but that’s sort of my style when I do listen to that stuff anyway.</p>

              <p>I don’t know how many of you guys listen to Falling In Reverse or pay attention to them. But their new album is out in June. They release a single called “Alone” and they changed their sound. Here’s what they sounded in their first album:<br>
<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="rgWr2nln83s" data-youtube-title='Falling In Reverse - "The Drug In Me Is You"' data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div></p>
<p>And here’s what they sound like now:<br>
<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="zcbOfVKSMkA" data-youtube-title='Falling In Reverse - "Alone"' data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div></p>
<p>Also, their lead singer, Ronnie Radke, supposedly left.
