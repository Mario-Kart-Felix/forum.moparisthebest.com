    <title>[Writing]Help me! I need an idea! A Topic!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/writing-help-me-i-need-an-idea-a-topic/15449</link>
    <description>I&#39;m suppose to write about an incident that changed my view on life. Something that is important to write about. Some experiences that taught me something. I can&#39;t think of anything. So I&#39;m hoping to just get an idea and get this over with..  

It has to be like an adventure, or something interesting that happened where you work. While implementing the above. 

Thanks so much. It&#39;s 12 am and I&#39;m in dire need of idea! xD
