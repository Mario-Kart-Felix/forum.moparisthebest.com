    <title>Trading not working?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trading-not-working/437333</link>
    <description>Hello

So I need some help with this.
I am using the InsanityX source, and whenever somebody trades it comes up with:  wishes to trade with you
It does not have the other players name.
Also, when you Right-Click  on the duel request, or even click on it. It does not open the trade window.
Please can somebody help me with this?
I will give people the code of different sections if need be.
