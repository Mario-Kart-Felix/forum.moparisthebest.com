    <title>In need of some guidance / accurate up to date info</title>

    <description>Hi everyone! I am a new member and entirely new to creating servers. I have been playing around in the server/client download section of the forum and have got a bunch up and running but none of them really fit my interest. I want to start my own server and not exactly leech off of the other already personalized servers. So i recently got the runelocus starter kit downloaded it and set it up. I logged on and it was like a nice blank canvas :). So here are my questions

A) I would like to create custom items, npc (shops and bosses),  things [like thieving stalls(with custom loot), tree locations, mining spots, bank chests or booth thing, etc]  / custom teleports, and commands 

B) I would like to know how to set it up so people can find, and download and connect to my server remotely (such as my friends, or random people looking for a cool server)

For now thats about all i can think up, but illl prbly have more. I hope to get some responses!!! 
Thanks for reading:)</description>
