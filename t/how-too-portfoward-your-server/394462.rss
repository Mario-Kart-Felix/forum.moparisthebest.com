    <description>[size=18pt]Port-Fowarding Your RuneScape Private-Server![/size]


Everyday, there is atleast 2-3 people on the Server Help section asking how too Portfoward... So I&#39;m just gonna create a Tutorial on how too do it.

Difficulty? 1.5 *

Requirments - 

-&gt; An Internet Connection
-&gt; Following Instructions Good.
-&gt; A RSPS.

When people download a Server and Client from here, a lot of them have no idea how to host it/get it online for other players to join. Well.... todayy I&#39;m going too post a Guide on how to Port-Foward. 

NOTE: If you are not using a Router/Wireless connection to the internet, you may skip this part and continue onto ~~~ Port-Fowárding (Pt. 2) ~~~

~~~ Port-Fowárding (Pt. 1) ~~~

I will be using a Linksys/Cisco Router to do this demonstration, anywho, the first thing you need to do, is open up your Network and Sharing Center, click on the Network you use too connect to the Internet, and then click Details/Properties. There are a few things here you will need to remember while Port-Fowarding.

-&gt; Your IPv4 Network Address
-&gt; Your IPv4 Default Gateway.

After you have these written/memorized down, proceed to type in your Default Gateway into your web-browser. (It usually comes with 192.168.1.1). After the page loads.. it should prompt you for the following fields;

Username:
Password:

If you have never messed with this, the username will be &quot;admin&quot;, and the password should be either &quot;admin&quot; or &quot;password&quot;. If you have no idea what these details are, and you have permission to reset your router then go ahead. But if not, you can &quot;Port-Foward&quot; with a Program called &quot;uTorrent&quot; (I wouldn&#39;t recommend uTorrent though as the server becomes laggy after 15 players.). Anywho, the following information should be typed as shown.

Username: admin
Password: admin / password

 After the page is finished loading, and it loads successfully.. you should be in your Router. Now, head over to a Tab called &quot;Port-Fowarding&quot;, and what you will be doing is enabling port 43594 on your Router. So, in your Port-Fowarding page, you might see something familiar to this;

Application Name   | Port      | Port      | Type     |  IPv4 Address
------------------------------------------------------------------

When you see this, below should be some boxes for you to fill in; fill em out to match:

Application Name   | Port      | Port      | Type     |  IPv4 Address
RSPS                   | 43594   | 43594    | TCP      | (your IPv4 Address)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you&#39;ve filled out those fields, and people still can&#39;t connect, your probably like lolwah??, if you have a Security Tab within your Router Setup, you may need to disable &quot;Filter Multi-Casting&quot;, so that your Router Firewall does not take this as a threat and starts blocking all incoming connections.  After you&#39;ve done all these, Congratz &lt;3! You&#39;ve just Port-Fowarded your router, but we&#39;re not dun yet  :rolleyes:

~~~ Port-Fowárding (Pt. 2) ~~~

On this part, you will be adding the port too your Firewall so that players can connect! Now, most people aren&#39;t even familiar with their firewall, so they may be wondering, How would I do this? Well.... if you are using Windows Defender, I suggest you just Turn that off, as that will probably only cause problems. Secondly, other firewalls such as:

-&gt; Norton Internet Security
-&gt; AVG
-&gt; Barracuda NG
-&gt; Symantec
-&gt; Any firewall really...

You will need these firewalls to not block port 43594, because when all of these computers are sending one packet too just one computer, your computer firewall will just block everything without even notifying you. Now.. Packets are what computers use to communicate over the internet, or network, or just communication straight up. But allowing the ports will allow packets from that port, so that the Computers may Communicate peacly without the firewall interrupting. Every Firewall is different, so I will not be able to post a guide on here about allowing ports through firewalls, but, if you feel safe enough, you can just turn them off. (I turned mine [and still do] when I host my RuneScape Private-Servers). After you are finished with this, make sure that the batch file for your server works, if it says something maybe like I dunno &quot;Cannot find path specified for JavaC&quot; or something like that..

Then you will need to set-up the correct Path variable, connecting it to your JavaC (bin) in your JDK. Don&#39;t get confused though, as it&#39;s nothing hard at all here;

-&gt; Right click on the &quot;Computer&quot; (above the Control Panel Option) in the Start Menu, and then Click on &quot;Properties&quot;.
-&gt; Click on &quot;Advanced System Settings&quot; in the top left corner.
-&gt;Navigate to the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab when this loads, at the bottom of the Box should display a button saying &quot;Environment Variables&quot;.

Now.. a little to the bottom, you should see some words saying &quot;System variables&quot;, scroll through those and look for Path, and add one for java just to be safe :P. Anywho, now you will need to locate your JDK version so you can set the path correctly.. if you just saved it by Default, then it will be in:

C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_24\bin;
or..
C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_24\bin;

NOTE: Please be sure to change your JDK version that you have to the one that you are adding, and also remember to keep the &quot;;&quot; afer bin like &quot;bin;&quot;. When these paths are set, I don&#39;t believe you should have to reset your computer, as I haven&#39;t done this for a while :P, but.. test to run your server, and if it loads properly, then goodjob &lt;3. 

And... now that you&#39;ve reached the end of this Tutorial and you actually use/read it, comment on any improvements\fails that should be added/removed..

Pictures will be up by tomarrow thou, and I&#39;ll try too make the guide look better with colors, fonts, etc. &lt;3  :rolleyes:</description>

Portforwarding is the easiest shit in the world. I can probably portforward almost every router around here.</p>

              <p>[size=18pt]Port-Fowarding Your RuneScape Private-Server![/size]</p>
<p>Everyday, there is atleast 2-3 people on the Server Help section asking how too Portfoward… So I’m just gonna create a Tutorial on how too do it.</p>
<p>Difficulty? 1.5 *</p>
<p>Requirments -</p>
<p>-&gt; An Internet Connection<br>
-&gt; Following Instructions Good.<br>
-&gt; A RSPS.</p>
<p>When people download a Server and Client from here, a lot of them have no idea how to host it/get it online for other players to join. Well… todayy I’m going too post a Guide on how to Port-Foward.</p>
<p>NOTE: If you are not using a Router/Wireless connection to the internet, you may skip this part and continue onto ~~~ Port-Fowárding (Pt. 2) ~~~</p>
<p>~~~ Port-Fowárding (Pt. 1) ~~~</p>
<p>I will be using a Linksys/Cisco Router to do this demonstration, anywho, the first thing you need to do, is open up your Network and Sharing Center, click on the Network you use too connect to the Internet, and then click Details/Properties. There are a few things here you will need to remember while Port-Fowarding.</p>
<p>-&gt; Your IPv4 Network Address<br>
-&gt; Your IPv4 Default Gateway.</p>
<p>After you have these written/memorized down, proceed to type in your Default Gateway into your web-browser. (It usually comes with 192.168.1.1). After the page loads… it should prompt you for the following fields;</p>
<p>Username:<br>
Password:</p>
<p>If you have never messed with this, the username will be “admin”, and the password should be either “admin” or “password”. If you have no idea what these details are, and you have permission to reset your router then go ahead. But if not, you can “Port-Foward” with a Program called “uTorrent” (I wouldn’t recommend uTorrent though as the server becomes laggy after 15 players.). Anywho, the following information should be typed as shown.</p>
<p>Username: admin<br>
Password: admin / password</p>
<p>After the page is finished loading, and it loads successfully… you should be in your Router. Now, head over to a Tab called “Port-Fowarding”, and what you will be doing is enabling port 43594 on your Router. So, in your Port-Fowarding page, you might see something familiar to this;</p>
<h2>Application Name   | Port      | Port      | Type     |  IPv4 Address</h2>
<p>When you see this, below should be some boxes for you to fill in; fill em out to match:</p>
<h2>Application Name   | Port      | Port      | Type     |  IPv4 Address<br>
RSPS                   | 43594   | 43594    | TCP      | (your IPv4 Address)</h2>
<p>If you’ve filled out those fields, and people still can’t connect, your probably like lolwah??, if you have a Security Tab within your Router Setup, you may need to disable “Filter Multi-Casting”, so that your Router Firewall does not take this as a threat and starts blocking all incoming connections.  After you’ve done all these, Congratz &lt;3! You’ve just Port-Fowarded your router, but we’re not dun yet  :rolleyes:</p>
<p>~~~ Port-Fowárding (Pt. 2) ~~~</p>
<p>On this part, you will be adding the port too your Firewall so that players can connect! Now, most people aren’t even familiar with their firewall, so they may be wondering, How would I do this? Well… if you are using Windows Defender, I suggest you just Turn that off, as that will probably only cause problems. Secondly, other firewalls such as:</p>
<p>-&gt; Norton Internet Security<br>
-&gt; AVG<br>
-&gt; Barracuda NG<br>
-&gt; Symantec<br>
-&gt; Any firewall really…</p>
<p>You will need these firewalls to not block port 43594, because when all of these computers are sending one packet too just one computer, your computer firewall will just block everything without even notifying you. Now… Packets are what computers use to communicate over the internet, or network, or just communication straight up. But allowing the ports will allow packets from that port, so that the Computers may Communicate peacly without the firewall interrupting. Every Firewall is different, so I will not be able to post a guide on here about allowing ports through firewalls, but, if you feel safe enough, you can just turn them off. (I turned mine [and still do] when I host my RuneScape Private-Servers). After you are finished with this, make sure that the batch file for your server works, if it says something maybe like I dunno “Cannot find path specified for JavaC” or something like that…</p>
<p>Then you will need to set-up the correct Path variable, connecting it to your JavaC (bin) in your JDK. Don’t get confused though, as it’s nothing hard at all here;</p>
<p>-&gt; Right click on the “Computer” (above the Control Panel Option) in the Start Menu, and then Click on “Properties”.<br>
-&gt; Click on “Advanced System Settings” in the top left corner.<br>
-&gt;Navigate to the “Advanced” tab when this loads, at the bottom of the Box should display a button saying “Environment Variables”.</p>
<p>Now… a little to the bottom, you should see some words saying “System variables”, scroll through those and look for Path, and add one for java just to be safe :P. Anywho, now you will need to locate your JDK version so you can set the path correctly… if you just saved it by Default, then it will be in:</p>
<p>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_24\bin;<br>
or…<br>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_24\bin;</p>
<p>NOTE: Please be sure to change your JDK version that you have to the one that you are adding, and also remember to keep the “;” afer bin like “bin;”. When these paths are set, I don’t believe you should have to reset your computer, as I haven’t done this for a while :P, but… test to run your server, and if it loads properly, then goodjob &lt;3.</p>
<p>And… now that you’ve reached the end of this Tutorial and you actually use/read it, comment on any improvements\fails that should be added/removed…</p>
<p>Pictures will be up by tomarrow thou, and I’ll try too make the guide look better with colors, fonts, etc. &lt;3  :rolleyes:</p>
