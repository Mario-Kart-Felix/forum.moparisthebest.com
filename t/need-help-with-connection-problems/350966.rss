    <title>Need help with connection problems,</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-connection-problems/350966</link>
    <description>Ok so i&#39;m at my friends house, we both have a laptop and i&#39;m setting up my server,

I have a VPS, I have done all the steps to setting up a server.
I&#39;ve got my client on my PC and my friend has downloaded my client and what the problem is; When I connect, my friend can&#39;t connect, So I disconnect then my friend can connect to the server,

Will this be due to my server having a code in it to not let 2 accounts log in on the same IP? If so does anybody know where I could find this code to edit or remove it? 

OR does anyone know what my problem is if its not the Multi-logging problem?

Thanks ALOT to anybody who helps &lt;3</description>

              <p>Yes it is the multi logging code.</p>
<p>This is mine. (It’s in the server class of source)</p>
<p><code>                            misc.println(
                                    "Connection accepted from " + connectingHost
                                    + ": " + s.getPort() + ".");
if(!list.contains(connectingHost))	{
	playerHandler.newPlayerClient(s, connectingHost);
	list.add(connectingHost);
} else {
	System.err.println(connectingHost+" already connected!");
	s.close();
}                  
                        } else {
                            s.close();
	System.err.println(connectingHost+" already connected!");</code></p>
<p>Not sure if this will be the same, but hope it helps.</p>
