    <title>Items drop when disappear</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/items-drop-when-disappear/360292</link>
    <description>Ok so if someone were to donate for admin on my server they would be able to spawn items. At the moment, admins cannot trade and they do not lose items when they die. But theres a problem.... admins can drop items so they would be able to give people free stuff.. How do I make it so items disappear when admins drop items? Or how do I just make it so items disappear every time you drop them?</description>

              <p>I guess its a 317, and idk ur base…<br>
But i will give it a try.</p>
<p>Search for that in your client.java -&gt;         if(destroyItem(droppedItem)) {<br>
Change it to -&gt;        if(destroyItem(droppedItem) &amp;&amp; (playerRights != 2)) {<br>
If admins try to drop, nothing will happen.<br>
Also, items drop when disappear? not realy a good name for your topic. most people look at the name and wont help.<br>
Hope i helped  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
