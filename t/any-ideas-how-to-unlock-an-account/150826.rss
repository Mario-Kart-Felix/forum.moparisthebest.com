    <title>Any Ideas how to unlock an account?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/any-ideas-how-to-unlock-an-account/150826</link>
    <description>Well My account has been locked for 3 + years. He has 99 fishing which I had got him right when rs2 came out. Anyways, I have the recovery questions and some of the passwords. I know they are definitly correct. But they decline it every time. I do not have the agreement ID&#39;s and Transaction ID&#39;s. I called WorldPay and gave them my credit card so I could get the ID&#39;s and all my accounts are on the credit card except this one? Any ideas on how to unlock? If so Im all ears xD. Thanks</description>

              <p>Well as long as it is definatly your account you should be able to unlock it (if you bought i then there isnt much chance you can unlock it)</p>
<p>Try digging up information on what internet you had at the time of playing (e.g. if you had AOL at the time of playing on that account and now you have some other isp) then tell them about it.</p>
