    <description>I&#39;ve watched many of videos on youtube about moparscape. I really would like to play.
however I downloaded everything I think that is needed to play, just when i start a server it says
Server: error: unable to startup listener on 43594 - port already in use?


what should I do to fix this and get on?[br][size=1]Posted on: April 08, 2007, 03:01:25 PM[/size][hr]i got it to work, im a genious.  this can be deleted.[br][size=1]Posted on: April 08, 2007, 03:29:07 PM[/size][hr]im playing but i keep getting disconnected after i load up on good items.
