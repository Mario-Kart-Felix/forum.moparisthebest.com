    <title>[PI] Mining breaks if you click away *FIXED*</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-mining-breaks-if-you-click-away-fixed/512968</link>
    <description>The title really says all. If you&#39;re in mid action while mining and you click away (like to walk, or use another object, etc) it doesn&#39;t allow you to mine again unless you change regions. How would I go about fixing this?

Fixed. Thank you runescape sucks and ohokay.</description>

<p>Well, when said player starts mining, can he click the rock again? Will it repeat the same message as if he had just started mining, and the entire method? If so, you have to stop the method in the packet that handles walking away.</p>

<p>There’s no actual message, and I didn’t check if it does.</p>
