    <description>Im looking to start up a project with a team of about four members. Two Developers, a Forum developer/Community Manager(Me), A Graphic Designer, And a financial supporter/ Finance manager. The project will be based off of the 317 revision and will be a economy server with great PvM, PvP, Quests, Skilling and fun events to take place in. I have great ideas and plans for this project so if interested fill out an app and post it below or pm me. Any further questions pm me your Skype and we can talk further there. The server&#39;s client and source base will be determined by the developers and my self when the team is arranged 

Positions Wanted:
Server Developers:
Client Developer:
Php, Html Developer:
Forum Developer:

Ideas: The server will be based off of a pi base with a selection of 474 or 602 data, it will also be a economy based server with a hard economy and loads of bosses and mini games.
