    <description>Hello, i was watching pirates of the caribbean and came up with an idea that would take private servers down a new road, player owned ships a step not even jagex dare take, unless they did not think of it, but i was wondering if anyone would like to help out with it sort of like a development team this giant leap will make servers more brilliant and more fun, if you have an idea please post it i enjoy to read the great suggestions and ideas.

tell me if you would like to join me in my quest of P.O.S

PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU WISH TO FLAME ME OR THIS THREAD PLEASE DO SO VIA PM!

many thanks, CodeSoft.</description>
