    <description>I am currently starting my first server and I could use some help.
I am going to make the server a 317 [PI] with a lot of great features.
I am in need of an experienced coder that would be interested in helping me.
I am willing to give you 30% donation profit and owner in game for your help.

I will be purchasing both a VPS and custom domain for the server.
I will be purchasing a TOP 10 advertise once I have the money for it.

Contact me if you are interested.
