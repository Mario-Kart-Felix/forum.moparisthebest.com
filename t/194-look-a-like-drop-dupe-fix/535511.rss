    <description>Ight, I really hope that this will help some aspiring 194ers.

[b][u]First:[/u][/b]

Head over to [u][b]Client.java[/b][/u] and look for the [b][u]pickUpItem(int item, int amount)[/u][/b] method.

Replace the [u]ENTIRE[/u] method with this:

[code=java] public boolean pickUpItem(int item, int amount) {
			if (pickuptime &gt; System.currentTimeMillis()) {
				return false;
			} else {
				pickuptime = System.currentTimeMillis() + 1000; 
                if (!Equipment.itemStackable[item] || amount &lt; 1) {
                        amount = 1;
                }
                if (freeSlots() &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; poimiY == currentY &amp;&amp; poimiX == currentX) {
                        // The following 6 rows delete the item from the ground
                        outStream.createFrame(85); // setting the location
                        outStream.writeByteC(currentY);
                        outStream.writeByteC(currentX);
                        outStream.createFrame(156); // remove item frame
                        outStream.writeByteS(0); // x(4 MSB) y(LSB) coords
                        outStream.writeWord(item); // itemid

                        for (int i = 0; i &lt; playerItems.length; i++) {
                                if (playerItems[i] == (item + 1)
                                                &amp;&amp; Equipment.itemStackable[item] &amp;&amp; playerItems[i] &gt; 0) {
                                        playerItems[i] = item + 1;
                                        if ((playerItemsN[i] + amount) &lt; maxItemAmount
                                                        &amp;&amp; (playerItemsN[i] + amount) &gt; 0) {
                                                playerItemsN[i] += amount;
                                        } else {
                                                return false;
                                        }
                                        outStream.createFrameVarSizeWord(34);
                                        outStream.writeWord(3214);

                                        if (playerItemsN[i] &gt; 254) {
                                                outStream.writeByte(255);
                                                outStream.writeDWord(playerItemsN[i]);

                                        i = 30;
                                        return true;
                                }
                        }
                        for (int i = 0; i &lt; playerItems.length; i++) {
                                if (playerItems[i] &lt;= 0) {
                                        playerItems[i] = item + 1;
                                        if (amount &lt; maxItemAmount) {
                                                playerItemsN[i] = amount;
                                        } else {
                                                return false;
                                        }
                                        outStream.createFrameVarSizeWord(34);

                                        outStream.writeWord(playerItems[i]);
                                        if (playerItemsN[i] &gt; 254) {
                                                outStream.writeByte(255);
                                                outStream.writeDWord_v2(playerItemsN[i]);
                                        } else {
                                                outStream.writeByte(playerItemsN[i]); // amount
                                        }
                                        outStream.endFrameVarSizeWord();
                                        i = 30;
                                        return true;
                                }
                        }
					
                        return true;
                } else {
                        return false;
                }
			}
        }[/code]

Then go to the [u]top[/u] of the Client.java file and underneath the line &quot;public class Client extends Player {&quot;

put this:

[code=java]public long pickuptime = System.currentTimeMillis() + 1000;[/code]

This should work 100%, I&#39;ve tested many time, spam clicking on a item you dropped no longer duplicates it!! :D

Yeah you fake recv packets to make items appear on ground or use cheat engine to change for example you drop a tinderbox you find it’s id number and in cheat engine change it to a party hat id freeze it, sure the item may look like a tinderbox but it’ll probably still pickup as a party hat.</p>
<p>you could also use WPE PRO program to filter the item id thats dropped by recv packets to make a actual party hat appear on the ground, using WPE PRO to filter recv packets is as easy as looking up the item id or knowing it of a item that you are about to drop, then in google typing “your number to hexadecimal” padding a zero in front if necessary, then just searching that number usually will be a pair of 2 hex bytes. Then just filter the packet that contains certain data in front of the packet doesn’t even have to be the beginning of the packet they got advanced mode where you can start “modifying from the position of the chain found”.</p>
<p>You could also use WPE PRO to dupe in some rs2 servers by faking actions like trading,banking and more complex dupes such as selling items, banking items and dropping items while trading the same items etc which normally you wouldn’t be able to do without a packet hack.</p>

what if a person spawns fake items on the ground? where does that code check if the item is actually dropped on the ground server-sided.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>What does that mean? “fake items”[/quote]<br>
by injecting fake packets??? this is why packet validation is important. never trust ANY information being sent from the client. global items should be handled with some sort of database and then when a request is made to pick up the item it should check if the item actually exists. surprisingly, even project insanity releases do global items this way. you can reference that if you’re stuck or (not to toot my own horn) asteria or one of arhams releases (I know arham, it’ll be done properly). or if you need any help or guidance just pm me I apologize for being such a fa<span class="bbcode-s"></span>g</p>
