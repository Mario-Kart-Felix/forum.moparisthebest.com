              <p>The code would be:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">// vars needed
var
  x, y, x2, y2 : Integer;

begin
  // code
  GetClientDimensions(x2, y2);
  if (FindColor(x, y, 53247, 0, 0, x2, y2)) then
    ClickMouse(x, y, True);
end.</code></pre>
<p>Make sure to set the dimensions using SRL. They have constants for the dimensions of RuneScape, it may help to look those up. Also, there might be a function which finds the bank symbol. It would be more useful to you if you posted on <a href="http://www.srl-forums.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.srl-forums.com</a>.</p>
