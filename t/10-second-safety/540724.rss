    <title>10 Second Safety</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/10-second-safety/540724</link>
    <description>I would like to make it so that upon teleporting to multi-combat wilderness, players will be unable to attack or be attacked for 10 seconds, as to prevent people with slower connections from getting piled by teams or having a chance to see whats going on without dying. Would appreciate any help/</description>

              <p>either add a delay in the (inWilderness()), or add a flag variable. or relative method for your source. If you know how you want it to keep track of the time you will have better knowledge of what you want it to do.<br>
if you have a server with PE you probably have a variable of time in wilderness already.<br>
This is different is every server, but most likely you will need a delay of some time.</p>
