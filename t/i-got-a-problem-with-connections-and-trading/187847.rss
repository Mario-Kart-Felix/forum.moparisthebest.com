    <description>I use richscape source, and its based of dodian. 

but the problem is dodian blocked same ip trade, and i got a problem with that because server thinks every1 has same ip as mine i tryed to change port forwarding tryed some things on no-ip. but didnt helped some1 know what to do?

things i tried

No-Ip: when u make a host and u see that ip box its already filled in with ur ip, i changed that into ip-adres from cmd&gt;ipconfig. when u do that u can trade but slowly peaple get logged off and when they try to loggin error to connecting server, and when u check on mscp and runelocus it says offline. so i changed back and it was online.

tried to delete same ip trade block: didn&#39;t help dodian is really hard :(   please help :)</description>
