    <title>Areas are messed up. Anyone know why?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/areas-are-messed-up-anyone-know-why/172544</link>
    <description>Okay so here is the issue.. Whenever I type ::pk (brings me to my pking zone) It logs me out. And when I go to log back in (Still in the pk zone) it logs me right back out unless I type ::home really fast.  If I use the other method (a portal) to go to the pk zone. It logs me out again. The place for ::pk logs you out instantly for being there.

Some of the players on my server are stuck because they can&#39;t get out of there..

I don&#39;t even know where to begin to fix this. I haven&#39;t been on in a week and players are telling me that this has been happening for a few days now. Anyone got any ideas on how to fix it?</description>
