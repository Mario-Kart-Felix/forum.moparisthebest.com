              <p>iirc it updates the player it is following location every second or so, check out when you follow a player look at the minimap, the flag is up on the players last location every second.</p>

              <p>probably exactly that, but rather than walk to the tile behind them which is stupid, walk near the player. that is, as close as they can get to the tile but <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> on the tile</p>
