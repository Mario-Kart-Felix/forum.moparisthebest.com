    <description>Well this is my follow code:(leech the hell out of it if you want :)) took me a few minutes but i have NO IDEA where to put this shit..

[code]
public void follow() {
    if (outStream.writeString(&quot;Follow&quot;)) {
                    try {
                        String otherPName = command.substring(8);
                        int otherPIndex = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(otherPName);

                        if (otherPIndex != -1
                                &amp;&amp; server.playerHandler.players[otherPIndex]
                                        != null) {
                            client p = (client) server.playerHandler.players[otherPIndex];

                            isRunning2 = p.absX - 1;
                            isRunning2 = p.absY - 1;
                            heightLevel = p.heightLevel;
                            updateRequired = false;
			    follow();
			} else {
                            sendMessage(&quot;The name doesnt exist.&quot;);
                        } 
                    } catch (Exception e) {
                        sendMessage(&quot;Enter the name you want to follow.&quot;);
                    }
		}
	}
[/code]

Also if you have any idea on what would make this better, any bugs that could be fixed. I also get some errors on stuff in there but i think it&#39;s just the placement. And btw i did make the outstream thing so when u right click you see the follow. + anything else.

Thanks in advance.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: April 19, 2008, 09:05:49 PM[/size][hr]And now i see i&#39;ll have to make a new void with just the isrunning2 so w.e.</description>
