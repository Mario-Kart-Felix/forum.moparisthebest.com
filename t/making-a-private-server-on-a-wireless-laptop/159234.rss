    <title>Making a Private Server on a Wireless Laptop</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-a-private-server-on-a-wireless-laptop/159234</link>
    <description>How do you do it? Ive done it on a lan computer, it worked fine. I did the same exact thing on my laptop, and it didn&#39;t work. I double checked, and everything was the same exact thing, all programs download. Do you have an idea how it could work? When I run the server, I start it, it works. I start no-ip, it works, just like on the lan computer. I tried to log on, it didnt work. I shut the lan cpu off, it didn&#39;t work. Whats wrong here?</description>

              <p>I did, but can you help? I just tried on my other lan cpu, and the server only seems to work on only one compiter, the one I started off with. I dont know why.</p>

              <p>I think I know why, I deleted svchost and that turns off the firewall and everything added, ill try again then edit this post.<br>
EDIT: Not working. My server is <span class="bbcode-b"><a href="http://darkrealm.sytes.net" rel="nofollow noopener">darkrealm.sytes.net</a></span>, could you try and see if it works?</p>

              <p>you can’t log in with the ip of the server, you have to log in with 0.0.0.0 and other ppl log in with like ummm… example.no-ip.biz. is that what you mean?<br>
