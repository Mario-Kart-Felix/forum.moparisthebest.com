    <title>N900 and possible replacement</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/n900-and-possible-replacement/438277</link>
    <description>Although i&#39;ve recently bought my third N900, i am looking for a more modern phone that offers the same amount of freedom and compatibility that it does, but i am yet to find one, does anyone know of a phone that fits this description?

For those who dont know the n900:
Its basically a linux netbook in smartphone format, 800x480 lcd screen, resistive touch and qwerty keypad, 600mhz CortexA8 CPU (OC max : 1.2GHz) , 256mb ram 768mb swap, 5mp camera 
but most important of all: maemo 5 OS ( a debian derived linux distro with a GUI based around GTK+ which means desktop apps run on it if you recompile em for armel cpu&#39;s )</description>

              <p>Samsung Captivate Glide. US only though. AFAIK only meets the physical keyboard requirement, although you will struggle to find anything like the N900 again, too niche a market.</p>

I’ve had a android phone for a while, although its possible to chroot to a normal linux distro on those, there is no working X server for most HTC phones, only  a Xvnc server combined with a android vnc app, and that is slow, also i like the fact that with the n900 you dont have to rely on a crappy factory bootloader, but you can just load u-boot onto it and have a normal textmode bootloader, another feature i like is the QWERTY keyboard complete with Ctrl key and arrow keys, and ofc the usb hostmode<br>
[/quote]So get a Droid 3/4? Will surely fullfill those requirements.[/quote]<br>
The Droid 3 is a neat phone, we got one for my wife, but all motorola’s except for the original Droid (my phone) have a locked bootloader which doesn’t allow you to change the kernel, which is a big problem when it comes to customizing it with different roms.  You have to end up writing a bunch of modules yourself and not being able to debug them if they don’t boot.</p>

<p>A computer in your pocket you could hook up to a TV, and have a small keyboard or mouse hooked up to.  You could do actual work on it, as opposed to an Android phone.</p>
