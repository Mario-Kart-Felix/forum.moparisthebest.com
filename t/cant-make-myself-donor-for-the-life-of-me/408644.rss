    <title>Can&#39;t make myself donor for the life of me!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-make-myself-donor-for-the-life-of-me/408644</link>
    <description>I really need some help getting my server online and in perfect running condition. My account is set as owner, and I cannot, for the life of me, get it to make me 
donator. I set donator= 1 in my character file, compile, and still no change. I take off the server, make the donor change, compile, restart server and it&#39;s still the 
same. I need help in some way. Teamviewer would be nice!

THANKS!!!</description>
