    <title>Webclient Help (FOR A FRIEND)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-help-for-a-friend/432082</link>
    <description>Well he has jared the client, and used one of those client website things for example [email]rswebclients.com [/email]where you can use the dropbox link and then create a free webclient but the problem is, is it doesn&#39;t load on his computer and just keeps loading java so I tryed it and it loads the cache but then it shows this black screen about java and retry loading the client or refresh the page.

Screen Error:

-What has caused this packaging wrong?

He now doesn&#39;t want to make it on those free websites, he wants to host it from a website of his own but would he need to make a domain? If so would it involve portforwarding again and if it does what ports should he use? and how could he make a auto cache downloader for the webclient? so it will upload and work to the domain he makes.


Any help would be appreciated, we are noobs at this lol

you can add him on skype maybe get things straightened out: zezimaa.royal</description>

<p>If he wants the problem fixed, tell him to ask for himself; don’t expect us to add him on skype and ask him.</p>
