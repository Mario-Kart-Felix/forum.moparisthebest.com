              <p>For the first issue, locate the code that creates the object that is blocking the entry ways. Which would be found in the class that sends the packets to spawn those objects in-game.</p>
<p>For the second issue, there are probably multiple id’s for that item, some of them are not the right ones, it just picks a random icon and then generates a false object in your inventory, or something like that.</p>
