[b]Let&#39;s be honest. Almost every server you join you don&#39;t seem to like after a couple days, only on rare occasions do you stumble across a server where you feel like you belong and where simple ideals you have set for a server are finally relinquished and you see yourself loving the server. If you have low expectations for this server, set them higher, because this server is one hell of a ride.[/b]

Being on this team I’ve studied where the downfall was the last time and am working to improve that, the main issue the last time was economy. Rather than work on that you’ve made this into a PVP oriented server with ruined formulas for special attacks. You’ve actually showed the one massive flaw off in one picture, a server with under 30 players by the sounds of it and two players with very end-game items, hitting insane amounts through very good armour which you advertise as “flawless”. You actually made me cringe so much that I posted in a section I haven’t posted in more than twice since I was a moderator, I don’t mind people trying to build on a good base but not someone half assing everything inside it and then putting it forward as flawless. I’m not understanding where the excellence of this is coming in that you’re trying to develop. You can be disgusted all you want, I’ve pointed out some pretty massive flaws that you appear to have just over looked and then when someone questions you on them reply that you’re disgusted and don’t prove to them that you’re any better than what they said.</p>
<p>This is a prime reason on why I don’t visit this section on the forums, you can certainly talk the talk but when it comes to putting some action behind those words it seems there is none.[/quote]</p>
<p>You could also look at the psychology behind the actual image and perhaps why it was chosen. Why do adverts contain these sorts of images instead of a low spec? It gives the player the feeling of power, and control, which everyone loves on a rsps. Whether you believe this or not, it does have some major effect. I’ve dumbed it down a lot but I’m sure you can understand.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span> good luck with this, however there is still a lot to do.</p>

<p>I know who you are and have respected you from the time I joined these forums, I understand what you are saying as well, but, what is the purpose of and advertisement? to increase the appeal of a product to the target market, the average RsPs player has no understanding of what “Flawless” really is… You, as a person with prior knowledge of the correct function of a flawless server can Identify this and I respect you wishing to express that view, but I have no intention of providing something “Half Ass” Every day I seek to perfect what I currently have, this advertisement is merely to attract the initial player base, and over time, I will seek to perfect this source as well. I hope I have not offended you in any way and that you can understand where I’m coming from.</p>
