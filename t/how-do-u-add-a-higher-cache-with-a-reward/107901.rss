    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-u-add-a-higher-cache-with-a-reward/107901</link>
    <description>My pimpscape server is really old, and i want to update it so i can see P.C. (pest control) and other new stuff, but i cant &gt;.&lt;

why? i dunno, and i think its because i need to add a higher Cache (because i saw other tuts were u need a new cache to see certain objects, items, and thing) so can anyone help me? or just spam in my thread?

Helper well get modship (maybe adminship) and well get added to ReapR Ltd. just like that for ur expertee with the cache thing</description>
