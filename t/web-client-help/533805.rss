    <description>ok i have an rscd source and i used marwolfs open_rscd_25 webclient tutorial i managed to do everything correctly and i was able to sign the applet and get it to run. 

now the problem is instead of using the darscape client i would like to use my own which is also RSCD only difference being config method and downloading cache method in mudclient. 


in  my mudclient file i dont have the method which downloads the data from my folder... 

and my config file grabs ip, port, and frames from settings.ini instead of grabbing straight from config.java 


which is why i dont know how im going to get a webclient up thats mine which will work instead of darscape. 

also to add the darscape one wont login someone else told me its because of packets sent from streamclass but both my streamclass are exactly the same. 

also all my ports and ip settings are correct and it still wont connect it doesnt send anything to the server.</description>

              <p>the dark quest one is different just because it grabs config info from strings found in settings.ini instead of dealing directly with the servers config. which is actually the method i will also need to use …but darkquest works with RSCA. i hit u up on skype accept my request… maybe lil later we can solve this…</p>

              <p>Spent all day trying with the RSCA/DarkQuest compatible client found on CodeForFame’s Client GitHub project and with the MoparClassic mpc-client project on GitHub. CodeForFame’s client does the automatic downloading of cache files whereas MoparClassic does not. The two modern webclients pop out into their own windows when launched from the browser. The Open_RSCD_v25 webclient runs within the browser without problem. I can’t figure out why this is happening.</p>

              <p>yea thats already the same as my world.xml</p>
<p>thank you, but i prefer using the source i currently have. is there any way you could help me add the cache downloading method and config check in my source .i’ve checked all of the basic things there is nothing i over looked.</p>
<p>i just want my client to be a webclient. and anything that you help with will be contributed to mopar if you do, so that</p>
<p>others can learn how to setup a webclient. adding the cache download method .  i’m sure im not the only one with this</p>
<p>problem if you would help me solve this it would be a good contribution . i tried adding the code to mudclient got errors i</p>
<p>cant compile. i basically want my client source to do what darscape one does as far as grabbing cache from folder and</p>
<p>downloading in order to use my client data and not darscape. i tried logging in with darscape client even though i knew it</p>
<p>wouldnt be the same data content i figured i could login atleast. but i couldnt, i got sorry unable to connect. ip, ports, and</p>
<p>client version all match .</p>

              <p>Inside of mudclient.java, have you changed</p>
<p><code>GameWindowMiddleMan.clientVersion = 1;</code> to the version set in your server conf file?</p>
<p>You might be correct about the packets not being the same.</p>
<p>Just an update - if you are interested in using MoparClassic as your server source, I am adding a few things to the mpc-client so that it can work as a full fledged webclient with a cache downloader that checks MD5 hashes for each cache file individually.</p>

<p>its an RSCD source with settings.ini</p>
<p>you got skype or something ? will be alot easier to explain and help that way. and for the most part im all set its just a matter of getting my client to download cache so i can load my mudclient and data like npcs,items,sprites,animations, etc…   i had no problems setting up the darscape web client. my only problem is logging in.  and ip and ports are set correctly</p>
