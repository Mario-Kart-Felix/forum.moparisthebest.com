    <title>EoC: What will happen to RS2?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/eoc-what-will-happen-to-rs2/469254</link>
    <description>Well, I know most of you are happy EoC is coming. Well. Honestly, I&#39;m not. I hate it. This isn&#39;t a rant either. We&#39;ve been playing Rs2 for years now, even with the graphical updates, and the bombardment of Runescape killing updates this year. But the question that hits me the most, is Rs2 completely dead? You might be asking why I consider Rs2 different than EoC. Look at it like this; Rs2 came out a few years after RSC (runescape classic), and that had a major improvement in how everything worked, it changed game play completely. Now look at EoC. It again, is changing game play by a landslide (more then RS2 did). Thus the reason why I think they are separate things. Now JaGex has been rather shifty on how they are releasing this, by giving members all this time to get situated into the new game and all, the one thing they haven&#39;t stated, is if they will open a private section for Rs2 or not (exactly like they did with RSC).  Most of the players would migrate to the EoC seeing as it will be the main server. But Rs2 was never bad. The one click combat enabled us to do something called multi-tasking. EoC will make it harder with combat switching and all. The combat triangle has also been deeply hurt seeing as melee isn&#39;t as strong as it is currently(I heard they have &#39;fixed&#39; that issue). Don&#39;t forget skilling. They have in fact improved skilling. They made it possible to use the action bar for instant dropping, making it possible to drop/skill a bit better, but usually only bots do that. If they implemented a system where you could (for instance) press 1 to start crafting, or using a bonfire, that would improve it for the humans that still play.
What I want to know from you guys, the community of moparscape, is what do YOU want to happen to RS2?</description>

              <p>I played RuneScape back in 2006 as a kid, and I enjoyed every minute, it was kind of like a part of my childhood.  Everything changes and I accept that, up to about 2008 all of the updates were understandable, 2009, not so. And ever since Gower handed over development it all went down hill. It’s all about micro transactions and money. The thing that made RuneScape the game we all knew and loved was the all round feel of it. After the Evolution of Combat, players look like they have a fork up there ass. All runnig around with loveing ridiculous stances, equipping two weapons. What the love was going through their head when they turned the good old special attack bar, which always spiced up a fight into a bunch of retarded abilities and makes RuneScape just as shit as all the others. You all think the old combat system was repetative. If you had some skill and understanding you wouldnt feel that way. Wearing full rune and poking someone with an overpowered dungeoneering weapon isn’t PK. PK is switching armour, switching attack styles, tactical eating, weapon combos and switches. In my opinion hybridding was the only way to show off true skill in runescape, now we have a bunch of 12 year olds with their torva they bought from Gold4RS with 564765856856 HP and spamming their keyboards and hitting action buttons. Bring back an old server. Dont give us the we cant bullshit. We have private servers with csutomisable gameframes, so JaGex, love you for loveing taking away part of our childhood. Also I must add I’m doing work experience at Jagex Game Studios becuase I live in Cambridge, believe me I will sepak my mind.</p>
