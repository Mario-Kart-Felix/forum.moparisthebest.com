    <title>Trouble logging in</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trouble-logging-in/331095</link>
    <description>Hello, I have had some trouble lately. After clicking log in, this message would appear in the message box (the black one below the game screen):

Server:ClientHandler: Accepted from owner-b553dba5a.home:2457

I&#39;m not sure what this means, but my character was unable to move and a &quot;connection lost&quot; message appeared shortly after login. In addition, when I tried to log in again, the box said that I was already logged in. What is this?

Thanks, Mod Soren</description>
