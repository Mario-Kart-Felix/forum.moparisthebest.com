    <title>How to handle noobs? and what makes you one?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-handle-noobs-and-what-makes-you-one/12232</link>
    <description>well, a day or two ago,
i&#39;ve seen a vid of zezima&#39;s friend chat:
what do people in god bless think zezima is?
superman? think he&#39;s rich? (well there are people even richer then zezz)
omg, anyway, what you people said was almost unreadeble
&quot;hi&quot; (a 250times i think)
&quot;can i have free stuff?&quot; (couldn&#39;t count number)

and i even think its funny if noobs follow 
you and ask: &quot; can i have some free stuff? &quot;
well, this will learn you to answer them, the &#39;rich style&#39; way:

french way:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&#39;what?&#39; *noobs following*
&#39;can i have some fre stoef ??&#39; *noob cant write =p*
&#39;oh, erm, parlez-vous francais?&#39;
and noob will leave inmidiatly&lt;/blockquote&gt;

english way (funny way to=p):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&#39;what?&#39; *noobs following*
&#39;can i have some fre stoef ??&#39; *noob cant write =p*
&#39;oh sorry, i&#39;m poor myself&#39;
&#39;you weer dragon chain thats 250mill!&#39;
&#39;lol, thats just 15m&#39;
&#39;and now you dun have $?&#39;
&#39;no..exept that 40m thats resting on my bank&#39;
then he&#39;ll still follow you,
goto north (the wildy side)
and normally the noob will leave directly =p&lt;/blockquote&gt;

i have more fun with english style..
anyway, now what makes you a noob

&lt;blockquote&gt;1. call other people noobs,
 when they are&#39;nt
2. ask people for free stuff
3. have zezima in your friends list
(couse whenever he&#39;s online, you can&#39;t resist it to send something)
4. act like you where a member, but never was
 couse when the memb ask you questions, you might not answer
(and when you find me ingame, i will know that you&#39;ve never read this =p)
5. use protect melee from the qmallest attack you recieve (alike a rat)
 when where talking about quests and 90+ monsters, it doesn&#39;t make you noobish.
6. scamming&lt;/blockquote&gt;

what provides you to not become a noob:
&lt;blockquote&gt;1. when in dueling/castlewars another player
 uses protect melee, call it a &#39;prayer nub&#39;
(this is a real noob then)
2. add zezz to your ignore list 
 (only for real zezz haters =p)
3. have a lot of cash on your bank
5. dare to lie when it goes about buying something
 (this is called merchanting: nah i&#39;ve seen that selling for ....k)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

any more nooby things, add in a reply,
if it are funny ways of noobs in non membs
also tell them, couse that will make me even more laufgh. =p</description>

<p>All slang words have a meaning and none more specific than noob in the context of the Runescape world. It means you’re new, in mindset if not reality.</p>

Being a noob is dying in the wilderness. Being a noob is bowing down to <span class="bbcode-b">the man</span>.  Being a noob is talking about Zezima. Being a noob is paying 5$ a month for a shitty java game. Being a noob is getting scammed by Jagex into thinking that Andrew Gowers great, original game, has anything to do with the shit being sliced and diced into a consumer package by the soulless drones who design things like “The Stronghold of Security” and the “Slug Invasion” or whatever bullshit they pull out of their asses next.

              <p>well, a day or two ago,<br>
i’ve seen a vid of zezima’s friend chat:<br>
what do people in god bless think zezima is?<br>
superman? think he’s rich? (well there are people even richer then zezz)<br>
omg, anyway, what you people said was almost unreadeble<br>
“hi” (a 250times i think)<br>
“can i have free stuff?” (couldn’t count number)</p>
<p>and i even think its funny if noobs follow<br>
you and ask: " can i have some free stuff? "<br>
well, this will learn you to answer them, the ‘rich style’ way:</p>
<p>french way:</p>
<blockquote>'what?' *noobs following*
'can i have some fre stoef ??' *noob cant write =p*
'oh, erm, parlez-vous francais?'
and noob will leave inmidiatly</blockquote>
<p>english way (funny way to=p):</p>
<blockquote>'what?' *noobs following*
'can i have some fre stoef ??' *noob cant write =p*
'oh sorry, i'm poor myself'
'you weer dragon chain thats 250mill!'
'lol, thats just 15m'
'and now you dun have $?'
'no..exept that 40m thats resting on my bank'
then he'll still follow you,
goto north (the wildy side)
and normally the noob will leave directly =p</blockquote>
<p>i have more fun with english style…<br>
anyway, now what makes you a noob</p>
<blockquote>1. call other people noobs,
 when they are'nt
2. ask people for free stuff
3. have zezima in your friends list
(couse whenever he's online, you can't resist it to send something)
4. act like you where a member, but never was
 couse when the memb ask you questions, you might not answer
(and when you find me ingame, i will know that you've never read this =p)
5. use protect melee from the qmallest attack you recieve (alike a rat)
 when where talking about quests and 90+ monsters, it doesn't make you noobish.
6. scamming</blockquote>
<p>what provides you to not become a noob:</p>
<blockquote>1. when in dueling/castlewars another player
 uses protect melee, call it a 'prayer nub'
(this is a real noob then)
2. add zezz to your ignore list 
 (only for real zezz haters =p)
3. have a lot of cash on your bank
5. dare to lie when it goes about buying something
 (this is called merchanting: nah i've seen that selling for ....k)</blockquote>
<p>any more nooby things, add in a reply,<br>
if it are funny ways of noobs in non membs<br>
also tell them, couse that will make me even more laufgh. =p</p>
