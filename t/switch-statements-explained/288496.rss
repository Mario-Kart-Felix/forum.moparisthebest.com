    <description>[center][size=15pt][u][b]Switch Statements[/b][/u][/size][/center]

Some of the tutorials that i had made previously were not explained very well :( However, i will try my best to explain what switch statements are and how they are used. Starting from what exactly are switch statements?

[b]You will learn:[/b]

[ul][li]What exactly are switch statements?[/li]
[li]How to use switch statements in Java.[/li]
[li]The basic parts of switch statements, e.g [i]default values, cases[/i] etc.[/li][/ul]


[b]What are switch statements?[/b]
Now [i]switch statements[/i] compared to [i]if-else[/i] and [i]if-then[/i] grants a number of execution or action paths. It takes or works with int, byte, short and char primitive data types. A primitive data type is a [i]variable[/i] that has to be [i]declared[/i] in order for a switch statement to use it. The switch statement can also work with [i]enumerated types[/i], i&#39;ll be showing you how that is done later. A variable for example can be written like this:
[code]int myvariable = 3; //the variable is an int, and its value is set to 3. It&#39;s name is myvariable.

char [] alpha = { &#39;A&#39;,&#39;B&#39;,&#39;C&#39;,&#39;D&#39;}; // a char&#39;s value in this case are letters. Its name is alpha.

short mynumbers = 5555; // a shorts maximum value is 32,767, and minimum value is -32,768. In this case it is called mynumbers and its value is set to 5555.[/code]
The following code represents and uses a simple switch statement method.
[code]/**
 * 
 * @author Java Duke
 *
 */
public class Switch {
	
	/**
	 * Constructor(Switch)
	 */
	public Switch() {
		switchMethod();//the method needed...
		
	}
	/*
	 * The int is used in the switch statement.
	 * In this case the value 2 represents case 2 in the switch method, this will
	 * launch any information in case 2.
	 */
	public int names = 2;
	/**
	 * The switch statement method...
	 */
	public void switchMethod() {
		//names is the int being used here...
		switch(names) {
		case 1://case 1.Not being launched due to the value.
			System.out.println(&quot;Bob&quot;);
                        break; //ends case 1.
		case 2://case 2. Being launched..
			System.out.println(&quot;Billy&quot;);
                        break; //ends case 2.
			default://If the value in this case is too high &gt;2, this message will be printed...
				System.out.println(&quot;Invalid name...Please try again.&quot;);
                                break; // ends the default case.
		
		}
	}//end of method
	
	/**
	 * The main method needed for running the class.
	 * @param args
	 */
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new Switch();//the constructor.
	}

}//end of class
[/code]
The switch statement used here is slightly different to the one i provided, this one has no breaks, therefor the first case is joined and continues with the next.
[IMG]http://i31.tinypic.com/s3lfdh.jpg[/img]
The class displays a lot information which now i will discuss. The constructor [i]Switch() [/i] is used in the [i]main[/i] method to launch the [i]switchMethod()[/i]. The variable being used by the switch method is an [i]int[/i] and it&#39;s value is set to 2. The cases in the switch method, particularily [i]case 2[/i] is the case that will be launched or the information in that [i]case[/i] will be launched due to the [i]value[/i] of the int. In the class if i had changed the value of the int to greater than 2, or lesser than 1, the default case would be executed, this is because there are not other cases in the method which are greater than 2 and lesser than 1. Default values are helpful, because they tell us if we have not set the value to an appropriate number. The place where you add all the cases has a special name given to it, that place is known as the [i]switch block[/i]. So the switch block in the [i]switchMethod()[/i] would be:
[code]{
		case 1://case 1.Not being launched due to the value.
			System.out.println(&quot;Bob&quot;);
                        break; //ends case 1.
		case 2://case 2. Being launched..
			System.out.println(&quot;Billy&quot;);
                        break; //ends case 2.
			default://If the value in this case is too high &gt;2, 

this message will be printed...
				System.out.println(&quot;Invalid name...Please try 

again.&quot;);
                                break; // ends the default case.
		
		}[/code]

Now you could always go back and use your [i]if-then[/i] or [i]if-else[/i] statements if you don&#39;t prefer using switch statements, if you wanted to convert this [i]switch statement[/i] method to a [i]if-else[/i] method, it would kind of look like this: 
[code]public void switchMethod() {
		if (names == 1) { //the int name is being used here...
			System.out.println(&quot;Bob&quot;);
		} else if (names == 2) { //same int is applied here, value is set to 2.
			System.out.println(&quot;Billy&quot;);
		}
	}[/code]
Here you would still get the same print depending on the value you set to the int, in this case [i]public int names = 2;[/i], the int is set to 2, therefor any information in (names == 2) would execute. If you wanted to add the default case to the [i]if-else[/i], you still can, however if would like something like this, after the 2nd last }
[code]else if(names &gt; 2 || names &lt; 1) {
			System.out.println(&quot;Invalid name...&quot;);
		}[/code]
This code tells us anything greater(&gt;) than 2 is not in this part a name. The || means (or), so in this case it is also saying that anything smaller(&lt;) than 1 is not referred to as a name, or is an invalid name. Whats the difference in using [i]if-else[/i] statements and [i]switch[/i] statements? [i]If-else[/i] statements can mainly be used to make conclusions or resolutions(decisions) based or organised on ranges of conditions or values(integers), however switch statements on the other hand are used to make conclusions or resolutions(decisions) on a [i]single[/i] integer or an [i]enumerated value[/i]. We now know what breaks are right? They terminate each case that is in the [i]switch block[/i], without [i]break statements[/i] cases fall through or continue with the next case and the next... We should now also know about the default case, it handles all the values which [u]arn&#39;t[/u] handled by the cases.

[size=12pt][b]Enumerated Types[/b][/size]
I told you I will discuss what these types are and how to use them, and how much effect they have on certain parts of Java.
The Enumerated types are special types whose [i]fields[/i] comprise a fixed set of constants(A set of enum constants is an ordered agglomeration(collection) of constants that simply can be counted like numbers). Using enum types well, can make coding easily readable.
Couple of examples of enum types are values of Cars, Clothing, Directions etc...

How an emum type is different to a bunch of ints:
[code]/**
	 * 
	 * @author Java Duke
	 * Enum - Direction
	 * 
	 * More clear and easily readable compared to a bunch of ints...
	 */
	public enum DIRECTION {
	    SOUTH, EAST, WEST, NORTH, // The values of the enum.
	}
	
	/**
	 * Bunch of ints...
	 */
	public static final int DIRECTION_SOUTH = 0;
	public static final int DIRECTION_EAST = 1;
	public static final int DIRECTION_WEST = 2;
	public static final int DIRECTION_NORTH = 3;[/code]
The names of the enum type are in upper case letters is because they are [i]constants[/i].
Here is an example class  i made of using an [i]enum type[/i] in a switch statement.
[code]/**
 * 
 * @author Java Duke
 *
 */
public class EnumDemo {
	/*
	 * We need a static modifier, we can change to static...
	 */
	public static EnumDemo ed = new EnumDemo();
	
	/**
	 * The enum - Direction
	 * @author Java Duke
	 *
	 */
public enum Direction {
    NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST
}

/**
 * The switch method, if-else statements can be used as well...
 */
public void switchMethod() {
	/*
	 * We instance...
	 */
	Direction dr = Direction.NORTH;
	switch(dr) {
	case NORTH:
		System.out.println(&quot;Heading North...&quot;);
		break;
	case SOUTH:
		System.out.println(&quot;Heading South...&quot;);
		break;
	case EAST:
		System.out.println(&quot;Heading East...&quot;);
		break;
	case WEST:
		System.out.println(&quot;Heading West...&quot;);
		break;
		default:
			System.out.println(&quot;Invalid direction...&quot;);
	
	}
}

/**
 * The main method needed for running the class...
 * @param args
 */
public static void main(String[] args) {
	ed.switchMethod();
}

}// end of class
[/code]
As you might have noticed some massive differences here, for example the total modification of the [i]switch block[/i], the cases no longer take numbers and are now involved with letters.
[IMG]http://i31.tinypic.com/25z439j.jpg[/img]
The cases are now involved with the Direction [i]enum[/i] type, as you might have also noticed the main code that allows this to happen:
[code]Direction dr = Direction.NORTH;[/code]
Just like a normal int, the value here is &quot;NORTH&quot;, if north were to be case 2, and you wanted to execute case 2 with an int, the int&#39;s value would be set to 2. In this case the value is &quot;NORTH&quot; so any information in the case NORTH will be executed. Continuing down, the main method is needed to run the class, we want to run a specific part of the class, a void which is non-static, we do this by adding the static &quot;modifier&quot;, this allows us to use the void in a non-static method.
[code]public static EnumDemo ed = new EnumDemo();[/code]
When we compile and run the class file, the cmd should show this:
[code]Heading North...
Press any key to continue . . .[/code]

That&#39;s about it for today, i hope the information I&#39;ve provided about switch statements help individuals on the forum and in Java.

<p>this message will be printed…<br>
System.out.println("Invalid name…Please try</p>

Here you would still get the same print depending on the value you set to the int, in this case <span class="bbcode-i">public int names = 2;</span>, the int is set to 2, therefor any information in (names == 2) would execute.

public enum DIRECTION {<br>
SOUTH, EAST, WEST, NORTH, // The values of the enum.<br>
}</p>
<pre><code>/**

<p>The names of the enum type are in upper case letters is because they are <span class="bbcode-i">constants</span>.<br>
Here is an example class  i made of using an <span class="bbcode-i">enum type</span> in a switch statement.</p>
<p>[code]/**<br>

<ul>
<li>
<span class="mention">@author</span> Java Duke</li>
<li>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>/<br>
public class EnumDemo {<br>
/</em><br>
* We need a static modifier, we can change to static…<br>
*/<br>
public static EnumDemo ed = new EnumDemo();</p>
<pre><code>/**
 * The enum - Direction
 * @author Java Duke

 */
</code></pre>
<p>public enum Direction {<br>
NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST<br>
}</p>
<p>/**</p>

<p>The switch method, if-else statements can be used as well…<br>
<em>/<br>
public void switchMethod() {<br>

<li>We instance…<br>
*/<br>
Direction dr = Direction.NORTH;<br>
switch(dr) {<br>
case NORTH:<br>
System.out.println(“Heading North…”);<br>
break;<br>
case SOUTH:<br>
System.out.println(“Heading South…”);<br>
break;<br>
case EAST:<br>
System.out.println(“Heading East…”);<br>
break;<br>
case WEST:<br>
System.out.println(“Heading West…”);<br>
break;<br>
default:<br>
System.out.println(“Invalid direction…”);</li>
</ul>

<p>/**</p>

public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
ed.switchMethod();<br>

</ul>
<p>}// end of class<br>

As you might have noticed some massive differences here, for example the total modification of the <span class="bbcode-i">switch block</span>, the cases no longer take numbers and are now involved with letters.<br>
<img src="http://i31.tinypic.com/25z439j.jpg" alt width="" height=""><br>
The cases are now involved with the Direction <span class="bbcode-i">enum</span> type, as you might have also noticed the main code that allows this to happen:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Direction dr = Direction.NORTH;</code></pre>
<p>Just like a normal int, the value here is “NORTH”, if north were to be case 2, and you wanted to execute case 2 with an int, the int’s value would be set to 2. In this case the value is “NORTH” so any information in the case NORTH will be executed. Continuing down, the main method is needed to run the class, we want to run a specific part of the class, a void which is non-static, we do this by adding the static “modifier”, this allows us to use the void in a non-static method.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public static EnumDemo ed = new EnumDemo();</code></pre>
<p>When we compile and run the class file, the cmd should show this:</p>
<p><code>Heading North...
Press any key to continue . . .</code></p>
<p>That’s about it for today, i hope the information I’ve provided about switch statements help individuals on the forum and in Java.<br>
