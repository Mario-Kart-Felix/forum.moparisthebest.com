    <title>Anyone want any help with a server? :-)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-want-any-help-with-a-server/405748</link>
    <description>[center]I am looking for someone who has just started a &#39;RSPS&#39; and would like help with it.. I would prefere it if it was already online and active, and if you give me co-ownership (player rights 3) i could help you become big! :-)

Well i am an experienced java coder :-) i know how to keep a good economy, basically how to keep your server alive :-)
I could almost do anything in java coding, i am full of idea&#39;s for keeping the server better..

I say with my help, within the first week you could have 50+ players on at a time (preferably if your server is 24/7)..

Comment or send me a mail :-) Hope to hear from you soon.

[u]OR[/u]..
Does anyone want any help overall? :-) i will do a tutorial for whatever you need/want? Or show you how to do it.. :-) 

Many thanks,
Lee [/center]</description>
