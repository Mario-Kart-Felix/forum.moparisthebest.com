<p>Thats because they are all ignorant faggots who obviously hate it just because its not based in modern times, i think it’ll definatly be better due to a better Ai and more realisitic extra effects, i said this on the other topic too but i always thought CoD3 &gt; CoD4 and since this one is being developed by the same people as CoD3 i’ll probably get this.<br>

cod3 sucked.  2 and 4 were way better.[/quote]<br>
