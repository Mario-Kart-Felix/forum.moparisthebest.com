    <title>My rant about Apples retarded ads</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-rant-about-apples-retarded-ads/11612</link>
    <description>I just took a little look at http://www.apple.com/getamac/ads/ because my friend is a Mac zealot and he asked me to watch them, so I did, with an open mind, ready to believe that that Macs/OS X were superior to PC&#39;s/Windows/Linux.

I ended up disappointed.  All of the ads are retarded.  Take a look at them yourself at http://www.apple.com/getamac/ads/ and I&#39;ll explain how each one is bullshit  [b](No, I don&#39;t normally have the time on my hands to write something like this, it&#39;s just most of my friends are either out of town or school has started for them already, so I&#39;m a bit bored, and I&#39;ve always been an Anti-Apple.)[/b]:

1.  &quot;Accident&quot;:

- The ad seems to be demonstrating how Mac&#39;s power cords are magnetic and aren&#39;t a problem if they get tripped over.  Although... if you were to plug in your PC in a place where you have to worry about it being tripped over, like on a desk with all the wires BEHIND the PC, between the desk and the wall, then you would never trip over them!  

2.  &quot;Angel/Devil&quot;:

- The PC appears to be jealous of the photobook and wants to tear it up.  Apple&#39;s message is that PC&#39;s are not good for photo editing because they don&#39;t have iPhotos.  Maybe Apple is new to digital photography, but on Windows and Linux there is plenty of free software that does the job of iPhotos and more.  GIMP (Windows and Linux), PhotoPlus 6, Paint.NET, Pixia, to name a few.

3.  &quot;Trust Mac&quot;

- Ahhh, I thought we would see something like this.  So what?  If you use Windows and don&#39;t secure it properly then you deserve to get infected.  Ever heard of [b]Ad-Aware[/b]?

4.  &quot;Out of the Box&quot;

- Is this a joke?  When I bought my eMachinesPC, it came with Windows 2000 preinstalled and all the drivers were set up, and compatible with all the hardware.  I guess this ad targets the PC&#39;s that come without operating systems and need a clean installation of Windows/Linux.

5.  &quot;Touche&quot;

- First of all, the PC used the word &quot;Touche&quot; correctly.  Second, it is possible to run OS X on PC&#39;s, if you have a motherboard and CPU that are compatible with it.  I guess that means that PC&#39;s are the only computers you&#39;ll ever need. Thirdly, Mac users have been bashing Windows for years, and now they want to u se it?

6. &quot;Work vs. Home&quot;

- Again I have to ask, is this a joke?  
Music - Windows Media Player
Movies - Windows Movie Maker

7. &quot;Viruses&quot;

- See my response to &quot;Trust Mac&quot; above.  If you don&#39;t secure Windows properly then you deserve to get viruses.  Also, as for the whole &quot;crashing&quot; bit, it&#39;s not like OS X never crashes.  I&#39;ve used it before and it DOES crash.  At least when Windows and Linux crash, they TELL you that it crashed.  When OS X crashes the system just hangs.

8. &quot;Restarting&quot;

- Oh wow, comparing Mac G5&#39;s to Pentium I, are we?  My eMachines running Gentoo 2006 and Windows 2000 _NEVER_ reboots unexpectedly.

9. &quot;Better&quot;

- [i]&quot;Making a website or a photobook is easy for me, and for you it&#39;s not.&quot;[/i] Uhh... at least Windows comes with IIS and Linux comes with Apache... and for photobooks... hmm.. maybe GIMP (Windows and Linux), PhotoPlus 6, Paint.NET, Pixia, maybe?

10. &quot;iLife&quot;

- Yet another ad where they compare Macs with OS X preinstalled against PC&#39;s that have no operating system and need a clean installation.  Most PC&#39;s come with either MS Office or Works bundled, and I&#39;ve even heard of some that come bundled with Visual Studio depending on what they&#39;re intended for.

11. &quot;Network&quot;

- It&#39;s clear that Apple&#39;s desperation to sell Macs has reduced them to literally lying in commercials.  All the PC&#39;s I&#39;ve used have been able to communicate with Japanese digital cameras without a single problem.

12. &quot;WSJ&quot;

- Umm... and PCs never get good reviews? :rolleyes:


Last thing I&#39;d like to mention is Apple creating OS X with a BSD kernel.  After 9 laughable attempts at creating operating systems based on their own technology, they finally realized that it would be best to move to someone elses technology.  Yet they managed to fuck up the BSD kernel - OS X is, regardless of what Apple says, actually less stable than Windows 98!</description>

              <p>Ok, these are pathetic.</p>
<p>I’m going to skip a few because they aren’t worth my time.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>“Out of the box”<br>
Apple, creater of Mac, sell Macs directly, I haven’t seen a dell mac. Microsoft, creater of Windows, don’t sell Windows directly(in some form), my pc manufacter is Dell, it came with a Dell software bundle witch was all crap but that’s besides the point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Work vs home”<br>
Apple said it themselves, Macs ARE better for home, OTHER pc’s are good for both. My pc has all the software needed for both preinstalled, and no crappy 30 day trials either.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Restarting”<br>
My pc, my mums pc, all of my friends pc’s have never rebooted unexpectedly. I think Macs should stop comparing somthing similar to windows xp to windows 95.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“iLife”<br>
See my point on 6, Apple sells Macs directly, Apple throw in Apple software, my pc is manufactured by Dell, I got Dell software, if Dell manufacterd Macs aswell, I’d get Dell software on Macs. It’s kinda like “I GOT BETTER JUNK I WON’T USE THAN J00 N00B” type of thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Networking”<br>
Windows dosen’t come with all languages installed, because windows had no intention of selling globally. Some Linux distros did, however. I have never tried installing Japanese for example onto my PC, because I won’t need it. Sure, it’s useful to not have to do it but if you brought a Windows comp in Japan for example, I’m sure it would have the Japanese character set installed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“WSE”<br>
This is clearly an unfair ad, as PC can stand for Linux or Windows, I’m sure there not allowed to actually tell us, but after seeing this I won’t buy a Mac, it gives Mac a point, and not PC. Wow, Mac got a review, in a few months it will mean nothing, as do PC’s previous(if any) reviews.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The ONLY TIME my computer crashes is if I do somthing that my comp specs can’t handle. Mopar’s restart page, first time I got reset because my grahpics card odviously failed to load the image, and I got a nice little blue screen telling me why it crashed. As for Macs, I can’t tell you what you get when you crash/how often or even what may cause you to crash because I’ve never been on a Mac, so this post is basically me bashing Macs, but then people say Dell comps crash constantly, I’m on a Dell and like I said, I only crash if I do somthing my comp specs won’t allow.(It’s very loose about this, it might just lag bad or crash completly depending on how far I push it.)</p>
<p>ALSO(Yes, always an also :D), judging from the networking, I’m going to presume that the younge people are new items, and old people are old items, Macs aren’t THAT new.</p>

              <p>I just took a little look at <a href="http://www.apple.com/getamac/ads/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.apple.com/getamac/ads/</a> because my friend is a Mac zealot and he asked me to watch them, so I did, with an open mind, ready to believe that that Macs/OS X were superior to PC’s/Windows/Linux.</p>
<p>I ended up disappointed.  All of the ads are retarded.  Take a look at them yourself at <a href="http://www.apple.com/getamac/ads/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.apple.com/getamac/ads/</a> and I’ll explain how each one is bullshit  <span class="bbcode-b">(No, I don’t normally have the time on my hands to write something like this, it’s just most of my friends are either out of town or school has started for them already, so I’m a bit bored, and I’ve always been an Anti-Apple.)</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li>“Accident”:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The ad seems to be demonstrating how Mac’s power cords are magnetic and aren’t a problem if they get tripped over.  Although… if you were to plug in your PC in a place where you have to worry about it being tripped over, like on a desk with all the wires BEHIND the PC, between the desk and the wall, then you would never trip over them!</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>“Angel/Devil”:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The PC appears to be jealous of the photobook and wants to tear it up.  Apple’s message is that PC’s are not good for photo editing because they don’t have iPhotos.  Maybe Apple is new to digital photography, but on Windows and Linux there is plenty of free software that does the job of iPhotos and more.  GIMP (Windows and Linux), PhotoPlus 6, <a href="http://Paint.NET" rel="nofollow noopener">Paint.NET</a>, Pixia, to name a few.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>“Trust Mac”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Ahhh, I thought we would see something like this.  So what?  If you use Windows and don’t secure it properly then you deserve to get infected.  Ever heard of <span class="bbcode-b">Ad-Aware</span>?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>“Out of the Box”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Is this a joke?  When I bought my eMachinesPC, it came with Windows 2000 preinstalled and all the drivers were set up, and compatible with all the hardware.  I guess this ad targets the PC’s that come without operating systems and need a clean installation of Windows/Linux.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>“Touche”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>First of all, the PC used the word “Touche” correctly.  Second, it is possible to run OS X on PC’s, if you have a motherboard and CPU that are compatible with it.  I guess that means that PC’s are the only computers you’ll ever need. Thirdly, Mac users have been bashing Windows for years, and now they want to u se it?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li>“Work vs. Home”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Again I have to ask, is this a joke?<br>
Music - Windows Media Player<br>
Movies - Windows Movie Maker</li>
</ul>
<ol start="7">
<li>“Viruses”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>See my response to “Trust Mac” above.  If you don’t secure Windows properly then you deserve to get viruses.  Also, as for the whole “crashing” bit, it’s not like OS X never crashes.  I’ve used it before and it DOES crash.  At least when Windows and Linux crash, they TELL you that it crashed.  When OS X crashes the system just hangs.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="8">
<li>“Restarting”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Oh wow, comparing Mac G5’s to Pentium I, are we?  My eMachines running Gentoo 2006 and Windows 2000 <em>NEVER</em> reboots unexpectedly.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="9">
<li>“Better”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-i">“Making a website or a photobook is easy for me, and for you it’s not.”</span> Uhh… at least Windows comes with IIS and Linux comes with Apache… and for photobooks… hmm… maybe GIMP (Windows and Linux), PhotoPlus 6, <a href="http://Paint.NET" rel="nofollow noopener">Paint.NET</a>, Pixia, maybe?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="10">
<li>“iLife”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Yet another ad where they compare Macs with OS X preinstalled against PC’s that have no operating system and need a clean installation.  Most PC’s come with either MS Office or Works bundled, and I’ve even heard of some that come bundled with Visual Studio depending on what they’re intended for.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="11">
<li>“Network”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>It’s clear that Apple’s desperation to sell Macs has reduced them to literally lying in commercials.  All the PC’s I’ve used have been able to communicate with Japanese digital cameras without a single problem.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="12">
<li>“WSJ”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Umm… and PCs never get good reviews? :rolleyes:</li>
</ul>
<p>Last thing I’d like to mention is Apple creating OS X with a BSD kernel.  After 9 laughable attempts at creating operating systems based on their own technology, they finally realized that it would be best to move to someone elses technology.  Yet they managed to fuck up the BSD kernel - OS X is, regardless of what Apple says, actually less stable than Windows 98!</p>
