    <title>Client information please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-information-please/382107</link>
    <description>I know this might be in the wrong section, but more ppl view this thread that that of the client&#39;s. I figured ppl on here wud also know how to help me with this.

Ok, I have a v16 client for deltascape, but the run.bat doesn&#39;t seem to be working. It pops up then goes away quickly. I believe it is saying that the main class doesn&#39;t work. I know this to mean my path isn&#39;t set properly; however, upon looking at my environmental variables, they are set correctly. Plus, the run.bat file only has the following:

@ECHO OFF
Legendzz Client V2
JAVA -Xmx500m EGUI

so what do I need to do to make this work? Post links if allready discussed.
