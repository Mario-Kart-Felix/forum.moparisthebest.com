    <title>[PI] Ground items</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-ground-items/437050</link>
    <description>Ok so i did some checking around and i can&#39;t find any help on how to do this correctly. Im trying to set up an area that is similar to a party room that drops items there. I cannot figure out how to set this up though. How would i set up something that spawns items from a list and randomly place it in an area of my choosing? If you&#39;re willing to just help me out with the spawn thing so that it automatically spawns when i turn my server one that would be fine. It would also be helpful if there was a respawn timer one it too though :p thanks for any help. Im using Project Insanity too btw.</description>
