    <title>&quot;player in view fix&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-in-view-fix/354754</link>
    <description>alright so the so called &quot;player in view fix&quot; doesn&#39;t even work, i&#39;ve tested it out myself with my login melster. as soon as 100 people got in one area, my client crashes. Why is it even called the &quot;player in view fix&quot; whenever the PlayersInView() method is never even touched?

anyway How do we fix the bug where the client crashes because of too many people in the same area.</description>

              <p>[quote=“Kryptix, post:1, topic:354765”]The problem is packet corruption, we discovered this when trying to send a process list (containing SCAR.exe, WPE.exe, etc) down the line and it coming out fucked up at the other end.</p>
<p>You can’t really use a ‘login melster’ as an accurate test, we had 500 bots in one area all walking and talking and thought we had resolved it but as soon as we summoned 80 real players everyone started disconnecting.</p>
<p>The fix does work, we used it for a week or so with 300+ players in view, it’s also the same code which RSCAngel has always used. You’re just implementing it wrong.</p>
<p>It’s called the ‘players in view fix’ as before you realise what the problem is you automatically assume it’s a problem with the getPlayersInView() function, it’s just sort of stuck I guess.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks for your help… im guessing the server is corrupting the packet, seeing as you and KO9 both say “the client is fine”</p>
