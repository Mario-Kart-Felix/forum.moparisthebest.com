    <title>What features would make people download a blank server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-features-would-make-people-download-a-blank-server/534203</link>
    <description>If you were to want to download a &quot;blank server&quot;, what would you consider &quot;blank&quot;?

I mean, for me, blank is this:

[ul][li]Rendering (Doesn&#39;t need to be complete, just needs to have appearance complete ATLEAST)[/li]
[li]Packet System (obviously)[/li]
[li]Examples of its systems[/li]
[li]JAGGRAB, Ondemand[/li]
[li]Item Definitions[/li]
[li]Object Definitions[/li]
[li]NPC Definitions[/li]
[li]Event System[/li]
[li]Action System[/li]
[li]Tick System[/li][/ul]


That would be a server I would love to download. But really, Combat would stump me, so I would add Combat to that list also.

But I only speak because I know how I would make the rest of the things. What about the [i]average[/i] person in now-a-days RSPS community. What would they describe a blank server that they&#39;d still want to download.

NOTE: This [i]average[/i] person has the will to make things himself.</description>

              <p>For me it would be:<br>
fully working server, i mean bug free and stable what i should have not do anything with connection,<br>
then combat start not fully working combat just a arrow where it shows you, where to start,<br>
then well start of evrything, maby not skills, but still arrow to that class <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> not just buttons or actions,<br>
