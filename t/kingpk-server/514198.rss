    <title>KingPK server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/kingpk-server/514198</link>
    <description>I posted in another thread a week or two ago about starting up KingPk and developing it.  Even since then a buddy and I have been working on it and trying to get things straightened up.

The server is getting there. I will need about 10 testers to beta test the server this weekend.  If anyone is interested please contact me in a pm and we can get account set up.  Beta testers will have access to the game and will have to report to myself or one of the devs about bugs, concerns, improvements, etc..  So please be willing to provide us with some feedback, positive and/or negative.

We have been working hard trying to fix and tune up the old kingpk.  Though it is not complete yet, we will continue to develop it, add custom features, etc..

If anyone has any questions or concerns feel free to PM me.

Thanks for the patience for the people who have been waiting.

Also, we are looking for 1-2 more developers.  Please PM me with your experience in rsc server development, languages(code), and if you can provide and evidence of past or current projects.</description>

Tbh, the KingPK source is absolute shit.</p>
<p>I mean has anyone with a decent bit of experience checked the thing out? Its one of the worse sources I’ve came across, even easyRSC is better.</p>
<p>Anyway I suggest porting it over to MoparClassic/DarkQuest, after all it could all be ported over within the hour.<br>

<p>Please, (other sexy people) help him out… I’m tired of RSCE, haven’t touched it in the past 6 months… All I want is a f2p server again.</p>
<p>Seeing as there were no other RSC servers, it resulted into me turning to Rs2, Oldschool, WoW, League of Legends, Day Z, and last, but not least, RushPK, or something.</p>

<p>OT: Yes, certain people get a little butthurt when money loss happens.<br>
I can’t wait Troll, and I still didn’t quite understand, did you say… SPAWN? :\ If it’s only the starter items, that’s fine, but please no ::item :s - The experience rate was also fine.<br>
Thanks for even trying to bring it up - Please someone help him![/quote]</p>
<p>Why would you buy tribot vip, you do know they have numerous times been proved scammers of their members. Good luck with that.</p>
