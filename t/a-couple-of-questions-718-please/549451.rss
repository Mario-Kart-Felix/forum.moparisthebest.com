    <title>A couple of questions (718) *PLEASE*</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-couple-of-questions-718-please/549451</link>
    <description>Alright so the first being how do i change the name of my Cache Folder, and how to i add a copy of an item as another item in-game?
I&#39;m trying to make a copy of Coins(ornamental) and use it as another form of currency in-game.. but when i clone the item in ItemDef Editor and then switch out the caches in my data folder, and attempt to spawn the item nothing happens, the item doesnt appear at all. Is there a way to do that? And if so is there a specific tool i need rather than using ItemDef Editor?</description>

              <p>Hmm a quick google linked me to a 718+ cache editor on r-s, it looks to have a cache packer included, maybe try have a look for one of these for your revision and give packing a  go?</p>

              <p>yes but im not entirely sure if it is packing the new item in the cache or not, Item Def Editor doesn’t have a pack cache button, so i cant say for sure… and yes i have restarted both client and cache everytime i tried to clone the item.</p>

<p>he did answer that but that was what i was doing in a sense, i was adding it to the cache with itemdef editor, but it doesnt show up when i attempt to spawn the item, and the def editor gives the item an id… but i dont seem to understand why its not working correctly. and as for the cache thing i was attempting to change the name of the cache so it correlates to the name of my server.</p>

</aside>
<p>After adding to the cache, is it being re-packed and are you then restarting server and client? Sorry if my questions are so plain lul</p>

Hardcoded you would get the client data for the item and add it your itemdef class (client sided) and give it the id you want.<br>
But I can’t help you a lot with that as I never used 718<br>

Yeah, I can tell you haven’t…</p>
<p>Afaik: 718 has JAGGRAB. You do not need to edit the client sided data… You edit the item in the cache, pack the cache again, and restart the server + client. When the client reloads it grabs the latest cache, the cache with your new item.</p>
<p>From there it’s just making it work like a regular item…</p>

<p>sk8rdude461 seems to answer one of your questions in your last thread, you copy the item in the cache and then go through the “how to add custom items” tutorial he’s linked, maybe follow up with him if you didn’t understand something?</p>
<p>What’s the reason for renaming the cache file? I haven’t done this before but I’d start with searching your client + source files for all current instances of the caches name and update them? Take that with a grain of salt though, I do <span class="bbcode-b">not</span> have experience changing the cache folder’s name</p>
