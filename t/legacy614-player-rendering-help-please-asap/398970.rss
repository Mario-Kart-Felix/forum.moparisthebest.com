    <title>Legacy614 Player Rendering Help Please ASAP!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/legacy614-player-rendering-help-please-asap/398970</link>
    <description>Ok well I got the Legacy614 source and I got a working client with it. I also got everything else working up to when I log into the game. I cant see my character. I know that lots of other people probably have this too so if anyone could help me with this it would probably help many others. I&#39;ve searched for a long time and I cannot find this fix so please help me guys!! Also, I was just wondering, when my cache is named &quot;revengescapecache&quot; the client connects fine and loads to the log in screen but if I name it anything different my client gets stuck at 0% and doesnt load to the log in screen. It&#39;s wierd but if anyone also has a fix for that the help would be highly appreciated. Thanks!!!!
