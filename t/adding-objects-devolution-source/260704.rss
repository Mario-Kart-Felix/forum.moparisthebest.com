    <title>Adding Objects - Devolution Source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-objects-devolution-source/260704</link>
    <description>Well I&#39;ve been working on a devo source for a while and fixed mostly all of the bugs and now I think its time to start adding some objects but there is one problem. When I add something to objects.cfg, I compile it everything compiles fine I have all the right coordinates and it still dont work. I log in and nothing happens. Does this have something to do with client.java? I know when they made devo source they added it through objects.cfg.</description>
