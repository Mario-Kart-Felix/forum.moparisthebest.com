    <description>Ron&#39;s RuneScape Ban Appeals

All of these have 400 characters or less. Be sure to change them to your liking so that Jagex doesn&#39;t read these and put all these in their database, and if it got parsed with the same appeals, it would get instantly banned. SO CHANGE THEM SLIGHTLY! :)

#1 Dear Jagex... 381 characters
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear Jagex,
I&#39;m very sorry but my friend Joe was on my computer 4 nights ago. He installed some spyware which I removed today and he seemed to get my password information and started to do the macro thing that these mean macroers do! Could you please not ban me, this wasn&#39;t my fault. I&#39;ve been playing for a while now, and I know you guys are nice people. Thank you for your time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

#2 Noob... 400 characters
&lt;blockquote&gt;omg i cant believe i got banned!! im so sooooo sorry jagex, but i never used machine programs. i love runescape and have been playing for a while and i would never disobey the rules.i think my friend got my password cause he was over a week ago and i think he saw it. but since he was my friend, i trusted him. please please please dont ban me sir.i promise this will never happen again. im so sorry!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

... I haven&#39;t finished the rest. More to come soon.

<p>When they say that its final, and no other appeals will be considered I really think that they mean it now, because I think it has a saved boolean saying if your ban is finalized after that, because now everytime I appeal a ban its not even 5 seconds after I appeal I get a letter back saying I was denied and it's final again.</p>

              <p>Ron's RuneScape Ban Appeals</p>

<p>All of these have 400 characters or less. Be sure to change them to your liking so that Jagex doesn't read these and put all these in their database, and if it got parsed with the same appeals, it would get instantly banned. SO CHANGE THEM SLIGHTLY! <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<blockquote>Dear Jagex,

<br>

I'm very sorry but my friend Joe was on my computer 4 nights ago. He installed some spyware which I removed today and he seemed to get my password information and started to do the macro thing that these mean macroers do! Could you please not ban me, this wasn't my fault. I've been playing for a while now, and I know you guys are nice people. Thank you for your time.</blockquote>
