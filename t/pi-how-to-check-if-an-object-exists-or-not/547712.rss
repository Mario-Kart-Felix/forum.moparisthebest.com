              <p>You need to have periodic checks, or implement observable data types. (Essentially, make the player a listener for tree updates)</p>
<p>This would be a better way of going because it is needed for all Resource skills, They all require a singular source object (Fishing, Mining, Woodcutting, Thieving)<br>
When an event happens the observable can fire an event to all of the listeners(People who are interacting with it).</p>

              <p>[quote=“chazion, post:4, topic:547712”]What I’m trying to do now is basically create an array of Tree Objects which contain the coordinates and status of the the object at that coordinate. so in theory if a player is chops the tree down it is marked as dead and and a player can no longer chop a tree at that coordinate. if that makes sense. thats my way for now i guess</p>
<p>but to create all these tree objects when a player clicks a tree that has not been saved it will create a new object and save it in a simple txt for now. which is then loaded into the array list bla bla bla</p>

Both ways sound a bit ridiculous, but the first way sounds more reasonable than the second imo.<br>
If you load all the trees from a file at startup, you’ll have all the tree’s right there and ready. All you need to do is load the x, y, z, and rotation. When they load just add an extra boolean in the server (their status doesn’t need to save). It’d be true since all tree’s are spawned at the beginning. And then, once again, when the tree is cut, set it to false, when it’s back, set it to true.</p>

              <p>You could have each player poll the tree status every few ticks to see if dead, and stop then. This would create the same feel Jagex has where you keep swinging at air if you weren’t the one to receive the last log.</p>

<p>Easiest way would be a boolean.</p>
<p>Set the boolean to true when the tree is cut down, set it to false when it is back up.</p>
