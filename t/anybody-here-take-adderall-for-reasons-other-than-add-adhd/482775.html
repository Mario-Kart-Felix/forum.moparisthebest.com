<p>My question is do any of you take this for the same reasons I am talking about? If so what kind of dosage do you take. I am looking at purchasing off of the Silk Road so if any of you have recommendations please let me know. Keep in mind the only other drugs I have ever done in my life is smoked marijuana a few times after my senior year of high school. I don’t want to get addicted just have some before major exams or weekends when I need to catch up on alot of work. I think price alone is enough to keep me unaddicted though lol.</p>

<p>So you have taken it personally? Did you take it in extended release form or did you crush (I am interested in extended release). Would it be dangerous for me? I have no heart conditions, weigh about 130, kinda thin but not to bad. Is there a bad hangover the day after taking?</p>

        <p>Bro you’re fine, didn’t you ever experiment in highschool?  Adderall is like truth serum for me though haha, its hilarious.  Getting high off it and using it to study is different though, id take 2 or 3 and crush them and parachute it and i dont think id be very productive, im in the zone but its hard to explain haha.</p>
<p>Take 1, crush it up because extended release is bunk, and you should be good to go.  Nothing dangerous haha and addiction is only a concern if its a daily thing for a month of so maybe, but its not a first time addiction or anything near that.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>And bloody well relax, otherwise you’ll take it and not be able to study cus youre sketching out.  Think about it like this, pretend you’re someone wrongly diagnosed with ADD/ADHD, do you really think itd kill you?  Hell no, incorrect diagnosis happen everyday and tons of people take these pills everyday thinking they have ADD/ADHD and they dont, just a false diagnosis.  It really is quite common.</p>

Yeah I had been brainwashed when I was younger into thinking all drugs were bad and that load of shit by my parents. It wasn’t until probably my senior year of high school I started really researching all the things I had been lied to about. I have only done marijuana though.</p>
<p>Yeah the last part was exactly my thinking. The only reason I don’t want to go fake ADD/ADHD to get a prescription is because I don’t want to have to deal with the pre-existing prescription crap for health insurance.</p>
<p>I can probably get this locally, but if not I will try to buy through silk road.</p>
<p>Also is there a certain dosage you would suggest?</p>
<p>I am thinking about starting at 10mg. I figure this way I can tell myself everything will be okay since its a small dose and I won’t freak the fuck out and have a horrible experience.</p>

        <p>I haven’t really read over what has been written on this thread but Ritalin is also used to help with ADHD and I took it in my final year of university when I had a large or complex project as is helped me concentrate for hours in the library.</p>
<p>10mg was the dose I had to start but after a while I needed to up the dose to 20mg. If you are buying online then I can suggest doing your research before buying from the vendor.</p>
<p>My biggest top tip is dont get distracted and play Xbox as you will play it all day and be really good at it too. Oh and dont watch porn.</p>

        <p>Well I waited until today. I took 1/4 of the 20mg so 5mg. I am pretty focused on completing my lab reports and other homework and I am not tired anymore but I can easily browse Facebook for a couple of seconds to chat with friends. I feel a slight sensation in my frontal lobe area so I think this is an indicator that it is working? I started at 6pm and want to go to bed at midnight so I didn’t want to take the full 10mg dose.</p>

<p>Ritalin ended up being alot different than I thought it was going to be. I haven’ witnessed any “crash” from the drug wearing off, usually I get a little tired but thats mainly because I was tired before I took it, I can take a 40 minute nap and I wake up feeling perfect.</p>
<p>So yeah, I am going to keep some of these around for when I need to focus. Next to try is adderall because I have a feeling it will work even better.</p>

        <p>I have ADHD - the UK is different to the USA btw(or what i’ve heard anyway, people getting diagnosed with a 1 hour assessment, wtf? It takes 6 months of assessment here and you have to pass a certain threshold of severity to be diagnosed, so even if you have it, you may not get diagnosed with it…and even if you get diagnosed, they may not give you medication if they feel you’re coping well enough without it.</p>
<p>I don’t find it addictive at all, in fact my addictive tendencies reduce when I take it. I smoke far less, I’m able to think more logically about what i’m doing, my memory is 10x better.</p>
<p>It’s definitely not a placebo Pwnd. I can can feel my whole mind slow down and sometimes I can feel like a zombie on them. Depending on what i’m doing will depend if I take them because there are benefits if I do or don’t. They’re shit for exams because it reduces the panic and ‘quick write, time’s running out!’, instead i’m like ‘chill man, plenty of time’.</p>
<p>It’s also shit for coding because it narrows your thoughts into one, instead of letting them spiral everywhere - which is usually where my creative ideas come from.</p>
<p>To OP: if you’re falling behind in work i’d suggest you find the root cause and don’t mask it ;).</p>

Medication does not remove the problems. They’re still there, but to a lesser extent. Because it improves my memory I can remind myself to put in the structure and coping mechanisms. I stop going into rooms wondering how I got there, I stop putting the remote control in the fridge instead of the butter and completely not realising until I can’t find the control, I stop missing my bus stops and ending up in the middle of nowhere. I don’t know of ADHD charity who says ‘just go medicate your kids’ - they all advocate intervention and teaching first and formost. I spend a large portion of my day trying to implement coping mechanisms, tools, speaking to other ADHDers to ask what they do. You should see my room - I have 4 different alarm clocks(no lie, the latest one cost me £50), whiteboards everywhere to remind me of important shit to do and various other tools. I have to put a lot of effort in to manage myself - even with medication (I also like to make sure I have 1-2 days a week where I don’t take it)).</p>
<p>But medication did change my life around - I could go to lectures and actually follow them and concentrate, I didn’t have to spend virtually all of my time trying to remind myself to implement coping tools. I mean, you can have the best ideas in the world, how can you make a habbit of them if you can never remember to do them? Medication helps with forming good habbits which means now, even off medication I’m much better than I was before. I could never ever concentrate in lectures at school. I could never learn in lectures just like I could never learn in a school classroom - I was lucky that I was naturally good at maths and could teach it to myself. I never understood when people said to me ‘think before you speak’. But when It came to uni, I had to spend a good three quarters of my time, teaching myself the course. This is where it became very problematic.</p>
<p>In regards to the UK system, medication is a last resort, not a first…because the NHS has to pay out for it so they’re not going to be giving it out willy nilly.I think it’s a common misconception that all naughty kids are diagnosed with ADHD, they arn’t, not here anyway. I’ve worked at the national ADHD charity, I’ve listened to the parents crying down the phone because they’re trying to get help for their kids ADHD and receive none. You have to fight, to get a diagnosis in a lot of occasions unless the child is really, really, really severe. I’ve seen parents going to tribunal after tribunal. I don’t know anywhere where a school just complains and that happens - my school there were a few kids who were very adhd and they were never diagnosed because the school had no idea about it. Heck, I wasn’t diagnosed until I was 19 and I was a complete little shit.</p>
<p>Let me add ADHD is a spectrum disorder. There’s kids who are ADD - these have<span class="bbcode-b"> no hyperactivity or impulsivity whatsoever</span>. It’s a common misconception that people with adhd are naughty. In fact most girls, arn’t. It’s also a misconception that we can’t concentrate - we can concentrate on certain, specific tasks. Infact we can concentrate so well on them that 12 hours later we’ve not moved, not eaten, not gone to the toillet. Programming does this for me. Medication actually stops this high level of concentration - I can only hyperfocus when off of it which is exactly why meds are good for certain things and not others. I also feel it hinders my creativity because it narrows my thoughts.</p>
<p>Any parent who just gives their kid medication, and offers no additional support, is in my opinion, not a good parent. However, i’m generally against medicating children and I think it needs to be the choice of the person taking it and not the parents - but that’s just my opinion.</p>

        <p>I don’t know how widespread it is, but I’ve heard of teachers encouraging parents to have their kids tested for ADD (and presumably ADHD as well) based on behaviours that should be considered normal for a child.<br>
That’s here in Australia, at least. I don’t know if it’s prevalent (this is merely anecdote, after all), but it’s not unheard of.</p>
<p>I agree that people should do more than just medicate, but I don’t think a child could make any kind of informed decision as to whether they should take the medication.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Lothy, post:17, topic:482775”]I don’t know how widespread it is, but I’ve heard of teachers encouraging parents to have their kids tested for ADD (and presumably ADHD as well) based on behaviours that should be considered normal for a child.<br>
That’s here in Australia, at least. I don’t know if it’s prevalent (this is merely anecdote, after all), but it’s not unheard of.</p>
<p>I agree that people should do more than just medicate, but I don’t think a child could make any kind of informed decision as to whether they should take the medication.[/quote]<br>
True - I was giving a sweeping generalization in regards to medication since each case is individual and i’m no in any position to judge cases. My personal opinion on it is to wait until teenage years when it is possible for an informed decision - although tbh you’re never fully ‘informed’ untill you understand yourself both on and off meds. I still don’t!</p>
<p>Lothy, what would be the problem to encourage testing? Surely it would be better to test and rule-out or diagnose than not to know at all? ADHD behaviors generally need to be dealt with differently because negative reinforcement is less effective.</p>

        <p>Well, when you have an overzealous teacher encourage testing, and an overzealous doctor (or a doctor bullied into writing a prescription by a now concerned parent) coming up with a diagnosis (as mentioned above, one hour of testing in America – note that I have no idea how involved the diagnosis is here in Australia) then you wind up with incorrectly medicated kids.</p>
<p>There are plenty of doctors in Australia that over-prescribe, or prescribe due to pressure from patients. And the parents of children can be the worst of all (they freak out, and they’re relentless naggers).</p>

I guess it depends on the systems in the country - ritalin here is a class B drug, you can’t go to your GP to get diagnosed(and gp’s generally can’t/won’t prescribe it) and have to go through a psychiatric assessment. It takes months, and doctors may be under pressure from parents, but they’re under more pressure from the government not to prescribe. It can be hard enough getting antibiotics now!</p>
