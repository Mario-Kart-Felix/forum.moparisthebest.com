    <title>Help! God Wars+GS Stances and a few questions!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-god-wars-gs-stances-and-a-few-questions/326750</link>
    <description>Hello, I&#39;m new to making servers, I&#39;m trying to make one for me and a friend just to play around on when we are bored and i find it a bit fun to make and what not, i still need to learn how to to code etc. But i was wondering how do i make full gs stance instead of 1 handed.

Also, how do I get All 4 GWD Boss&#39;s and minions like the new deltascape and NRPK. I see that they have all 4 boss&#39;s and minions and was wondering how I can get those.

Ah 1 more question. How can i move an NPC from one location to another? Example:General Grandor, say i make a new location to put it, how do i put it there? And how do i make the area around it so it doesn&#39;t leave that little area?

Any input i get helps! Thanks to anyone in advance that posts input to help. 

Please no spam or hate comments =/ i&#39;m just starting and getting into this, so i don&#39;t know much about it.

P.S. Sorry if i posted this in the wrong thread section =/</description>

              <p>Ahh That makes sence, so the 4 areas it can walk is based on a square, basically…right? And it can walk anywhere in that square until it gets to those coords then theres basically an invisible wall and it can’t go anywhere else just in that box of coords. I think i understand that.</p>
<p>Thanks for teh help! =)</p>

              <p>I am not to sure, because most of this is through client side…<br>
Just ask a mod to move your thread to the client help section…</p>
<p>Alright answer to your moving npc’s around question…<br>
Their should be a AutoSpawn.CFG file inside your server somewhere.<br>
Their will already be npcs place within this file, go to NPC.CGF to figure out the npc ids, use the locations and what not to spawn an npc here is an example if my text seems like random mumbling…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = 2619	2447	5178	0	2450	5181	2444	5175	2	TzHaar-Ket-Zuh</code></pre>
<p>Note: NPC = NON-PLAYABLE CHARACTER</p>
<p>The first number set is the NPCId<br>
The next two number sets are the coordinates starting with x and ending with Y<br>
(X = 2447, Y = 5178)<br>
Third the Fourth number (0) is the height by default which is ground level is “0”<br>
The next four sets of numbers after the height is the range in which the NPC walks<br>
(RangeX1 = 2450, RangeY1 = 5181, RangeX2 = 2444, RangeY2 = 5175)<br>
The number after the range in which the NPC walks is “2” which is the walktype, I am sorry but I am not familiar with walktype…<br>
Last but not least is a description of the NPC, usually starts with a void… no not a public void but a void used to skip the text.  “//” is to void everything after it in a line.</p>
<p>Hope I helped,<br>
