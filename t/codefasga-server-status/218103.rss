    <title>Codefasga server status?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/codefasga-server-status/218103</link>
    <description>My server is running i know that for a fact because it posted on moparscape and people are currently playing on it.  But whenever i go to post it on codefasga.com it says an unknown error has occured.  At first i thought it might be because my old server HAD been on their.  But its not anymore and that port is completely closed.  Any ideas on how to fix this problem?</description>
