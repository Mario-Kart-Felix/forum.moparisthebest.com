              <p>Ok well 0.0.0.0 is just a loop back address to your computer.</p>
<p>Your ip can be found here <a href="http://www.myipaddress.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">www.myipaddress.com</a> or go into ms-dos and type ipconfig.</p>
<p>When you have that use it with your No-IP address.</p>
<p>If you have a router setup then you will need to configure it so that the server can run properly, there are many tutorials of how to do this.</p>
<p>Good luck &amp; i hope this helped.</p>
