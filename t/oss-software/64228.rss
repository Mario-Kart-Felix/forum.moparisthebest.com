<p>A good, or even decent cheat would be undetectable to Jagex regardless of whether they know how it works or not.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If it becomes successful enough, Jagex will dedicate effort specifically to breaking your cheat. If they’re willing to accommodate changes to their game just to catch you, you will be caught - simple as that. Source makes it easier to find a detection signature.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I think the ideal life cycle for a non-commercial bot is something like this:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Stage 1 - Private development</span><br>
This is when you actually code the bot. The nature of this community means that wide release of early code is quite counterproductive. Keep it to yourself, your team, or a select few knowledgeable people from whom you are seeking advice.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Stage 2 - Private use</span><br>
When you’ve “finished” your program, you should use it yourself for a while. I’ve got a few different takes on why - you could be enjoying the results of your work, or you could be doing extended testing for stability and detection. The effect is the same, it’s not in widespread use yet.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Stage 3 - Decision</span><br>
If after a while your bot is working well enough to merit public release, you have a choice. You can either release it now and see how long it takes for Jagex to catch on (maybe destroy the game if you’ve written a killer cheat), or you can wait until the next step.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Stage 4 - Release</span><br>
Eventually, something will happen. You’ll get tired of the design. The maintenance will wear on you. You’ll be bored with cheating. You’ll want to start over, and use what you’ve learned to make an even <span class="bbcode-i">better</span> cheat. Jagex will do something that makes it less effective than it was in the past. Whatever it is, you’ll stop wanting to use the bot yourself. That’s when, without fail, you should make it public. If it’s still viable, let people cheat. If it’s not, they’ll learn from it - because when you reach this point, odds are you’ve got a pretty good program.</p>
<p>This is actually the model that other online cheat communities use - someone discovers a glitch or creates a hack, then uses it for a while (until they’re satisfied or sometimes until detection). Then they release it for other people to use or learn from, and sometimes that leads to the next great hack.</p>

<p>I use open source software all that I can, it seems to me that 99% of the time if you know of a proprietary closed source program you can find an equivalent (or in most cases, superior) alternative that is open source.  I learned just about everything I know about programming from reading and using open source code, and therefore I feel that if I can give back to the OSS community by releasing my own software open source then I should.  OSS gives so many advantages to the user it is almost innumerable, I will list a few here:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Assurance the code is safe.  If you suspect a keylogger or something malicious may be going on, read through the code and compile it yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comfort in the knowledge that thousands of programmers from all around the world have looked over and approved of the code you are using.  Look at Apache, there is a reason it is the <span class="hashtag">#1</span> web server in the entire world by a HUGE lead, open source software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The support community is unparalleled in the business world.  Want support for windows? good luck calling micrsoft and waiting hours on the phone to talk to some guy in india that can hardly speak english to tell you he will submit a bug report.  Want support for linux? Join one of hundreds IRC servers (freenode is my favorite) and join a channel filled with hundreds of people who will help you usually immediately and free of charge, all they ask is a thank you.  Don’t like IRC? Then join one of the thousand support forums that are dedicated to helping people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bugs.  All software has them, if you are using closed source proprietary software you may submit a bug and hope that the developers may get around to it sometime.  If it is open source, there is a very good chance someone has already found and fixed the bug, apply the patch or even fix it yourself and submit the fix to the developers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many more, but in the end, OSS is always best. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>i learnt most of what i know from open source programs, and other people looking at my sources and suggesting stuff</p>
<p>that idea of sharing and open-sources is very similar to socialist ideas <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
however normally i keep my opinions to myself</p>

              <p>im relatively impartial to OSS, some sorts of programs should be closed, others may be open</p>
