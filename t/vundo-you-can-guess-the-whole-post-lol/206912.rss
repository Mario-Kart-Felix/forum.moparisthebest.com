    <title>Vundo.... you can guess the whole post lol</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vundo-you-can-guess-the-whole-post-lol/206912</link>
    <description>Ok, so a few questions, 
1. When was the vundo virus made,
2. What does it do exactly?
3. Why doesn&#39;t every virus maker make the virus they make like vundo?(lol mouth full there...)
Thats just some shit ive been wondering about while i try to rid my cousins computer of it.

I had the vundo virus once before I knew anything at all about computers, I remember trying for 2 weeks before I got rid of it. took me like 5 different fix programs, restored my windows files, used 3 unlockers, 2 anti virus programs and like 4 spy ware programs before I managed to kill it all the way. Now my cousin has gone and got it, so far I&#39;ve cleaned it out of his registry, deleted the actual dll, and replaced all the infected system files like explorer.exe and his graphics files that for some unknown reason it decided to take over, and It still persists, I am sorta out of ideas here, the last thing we tried was a vundo fix program, after 9.5 hours of running, It said something about 2 viruses and shut off saying it failed or something...

hmm, as to the topic name, I am assuming every one who has had dealings with the vundo virus had as much trouble as I described, basically its hell...</description>
