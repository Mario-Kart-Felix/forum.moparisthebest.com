    <title>-Xmx500m error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/xmx500m-error/459255</link>
    <description>I have just downloaded a server and I&#39;ve run into some problems.

In this one I go to: [b]64-Bit Run jre7 (3).bat[/b] (This is also the only one that works for opening up the client the rest all get the -Xmx500m error). If I should be using something else let me know)

[IMG]http://i1157.photobucket.com/albums/p596/Jordanwagner92/Help.jpg[/img]

When I first started going to that it was saying something along the lines of &quot; Windows can not find -Xmx500m. Which I know has something to do with the value of java and after a few searches I came to find that 500 is the average amount.

Anyways I went ahead and found this on the forums:

I went ahead and followed those instructions was able to have the client window open up (Finally). Then came to find that between 0-7% it would freeze and white screen on me, while checking back to the forum pic above I deleted the cache after re-downloading it and then it would open up and say &quot;Starting up&quot; and white screen.

It&#39;s either something wrong with me or I may just be clueless and the server may just not be online, but as far as I know this server has been on since yesterday. (This is an old server I used to play about a year ago, Have been waiting for it to come back up).

ANY help is much appreciated, thank you!
