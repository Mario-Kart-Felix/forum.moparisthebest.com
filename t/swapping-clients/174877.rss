    <title>Swapping clients</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/swapping-clients/174877</link>
    <description>Okay, the problem I have is, I want to swap from the Silab client [Yuck] to Swat&#39;s client, in order too do this, I need to snatch the Silab ID&#39;s out and add the SWAT one&#39;s, can anyone help with this? I&#39;ll give a visual on what I mean. 

[code]public static int capes[] = {10705,10708,10711,10714,10717,10720,10723,10726,10729,10732[/code]++

Thats just a small amount of silabs ID&#39;s and I think they are SkillCapes right? So I&#39;d remove them and add in SWAT&#39;s Skillcape ID&#39;s? 

If you can help please posts, as I&#39;m an idiot when it come&#39;s to clients.</description>

              <p>Silabsoft’s client is way better then the hardcoded shit SWAT made. She streamed the models to her cache, doing it the correct way. So I suggest you just stay with her client for your server.</p>
