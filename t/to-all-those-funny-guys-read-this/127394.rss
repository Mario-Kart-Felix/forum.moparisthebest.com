    <title>To all those &quot;funny guys&quot;, read this</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/to-all-those-funny-guys-read-this/127394</link>
    <description>This letter is not intended to assuage your worst fears about 4chan copiers but will, in most cases, confirm them. Here&#39;s my side of the story: 4chan copiers wants all of us to believe that granting him complete control over our lives is as important as breathing air. That&#39;s why he sponsors brainwashing in the schools, brainwashing by the government, brainwashing statements made to us by politicians, entertainers, and sports stars, and brainwashing by the big advertisers and the news media. For brevity, I won&#39;t comment further on that, but rather on the way that documents written by his patsies typically include the line, &quot;Abysmal hedonists are all inherently good, sensitive, creative, and inoffensive&quot;, in large, 30-point type, as if the size of the font gives weight to the words. In reality, all that that fancy formatting really does is underscore the fact that 4chan copiers craves more power. I say we should give him more power -- preferably, 10,000 volts of it. He is always trying to change the way we work. This annoys me, because 4chan copiers&#39;s previous changes have always been for the worse. I&#39;m positive that his new changes will be even more purblind, because 4chan copiers&#39;s complaints are as predictable as sunrise. Whenever I combat the morally questionable ideology of emotionalism that has infected the minds of so many savage, misinformed euphuists, his invariant response is to discredit and intimidate the opposition. I respect 4chan copiers&#39;s stances, although if his expositors had even an ounce of integrity, they would begin the debate about 4chan copiers&#39;s publicity stunts. Furthermore, we need to look beyond the most immediate and visible problems with 4chan copiers. We need to look at what is behind these problems and understand that 4chan copiers&#39;s grand plan is to inject even more fear and divisiveness into political campaigns. I&#39;m sure Mao Tse Tung would approve. In any case, 4chan copiers&#39;s ethics have kept us separated for too long from the love, contributions, and challenges of our brothers and sisters in this wonderful adventure we share together -- life!

To pick an obvious, but often overlooked, example, 4chan copiers likes to brag about how the members of his peuplade are ideologically diverse. Perhaps that means that some of them prefer Stalin over Hitler. In any case, 4chan copiers&#39;s pals insist that everyone and everything discriminates against 4chan copiers -- including the writing on the bathroom stalls. This is precisely the non-equation that 4chan copiers is trying to patch together. What he&#39;s missing, as usual, is that his supporters tend to fall into the mistaken belief that he has been robbed of all he does not possess, mainly because they live inside a 4chan copiers-generated illusion-world and talk only with each other. 4chan copiers managed to convince a bunch of haughty, profligate Philistines to help him displace meaningful discussion of an issue&#39;s merit or demerit with hunch and emotion. What was the quid pro quo there? It&#39;s an interesting question, and its examination will help us understand how 4chan copiers&#39;s mind works. Let me start by providing evidence that 4chan copiers&#39;s faculty for deception is so far above anyone else&#39;s, it really must be considered different in kind as well as in degree. One other thing: 4chan copiers&#39;s list of sins is long and each one deserves more space than I have here. Therefore, rather than describe each one individually, I&#39;ll summarize by stating that when he says that all literature which opposes expansionism was forged by impractical schmucks, in his mind, that&#39;s supposed to end the argument. It&#39;s like he believes he has said something very profound. Who else but 4chan copiers would have the brass to instill a general ennui? No one. And where does that brass come from? It comes from a sure knowledge that he can retreat into his &quot;victim&quot; status if anyone calls him to account.

4chan copiers would have us believe that he defends the real needs of the working class. Yeah, right. For the time being, this is not a major issue. 4chan copiers vehemently denies that, of course. But he obviously would, because his tirades were never about tolerance and equality. That was just window dressing for the &quot;innocents&quot;. Rather, in asserting that the only way to expand one&#39;s mind is with drugs -- or maybe even chocolate -- he demonstrates an astounding narrowness of vision. One of the enduring effects of 4chan copiers&#39;s inveracities is the way they will rewrite and reword much of humanity&#39;s formative works to favor adversarialism. Our path is set. By this, I mean that in order to shatter the illusion that sin is good for the soul, we must allay the concerns of the many people who have been harmed by him. I consider that requirement a small price to pay because if blackguardism were an Olympic sport, 4chan copiers would clinch the gold medal. To add another dimension to this argument, let me mention that whenever he announces that he is known for his sound judgment, unerring foresight, and sagacious adaptation of means to ends, his henchmen applaud on cue and the accolades are long and ostentatious. What&#39;s funny is that they don&#39;t provide similar feedback whenever I tell them that we are becoming a nation of pertinacious New Age carousers. His worshippers probably don&#39;t realize that, because it&#39;s not mentioned in the funny papers or in the movies. Nevertheless, 4chan copiers&#39;s generalizations just don&#39;t stand up. For proof of this fact, I must point out that 4chan copiers is known for walking into crowded rooms and telling everyone there that ostentatious crackpots aren&#39;t ever impertinent. Try, if you can, to concoct a statement better calculated to show how sinister 4chan copiers is. You can&#39;t do it. Not only that, but some people say that that isn&#39;t sufficient evidence to prove that he is secretly scheming to encourage and exacerbate passivity in some people who might otherwise be active and responsible citizens. And I must agree; one needs much more evidence than that. But the evidence is there, for anyone who isn&#39;t afraid to look at it. Just look at the way that if he had lived the short, sickly, miserable life of a chattel serf in the ages &quot;before technocracy&quot; he wouldn&#39;t be so keen to resolve a moral failure with an immoral solution. Maybe he&#39;d even begin to realize that I welcome his comments. However, he needs to realize that if you can go more than a minute without hearing him talk about diabolism, you&#39;re either deaf, dumb, or in a serious case of denial.

By now, the reader has discerned that 4chan copiers frequently plays on our emotions. So let me just add that he is trying hard to convince a substantial number of anal-retentive storytellers to lure the improvident into his club. He presumably believes that the &quot;hundredth-monkey phenomenon&quot; will spontaneously incite dodgy sybarites to behave likewise. The reality, however, is that 4chan copiers should think about how his prank phone calls lead the worst kinds of disgusting stumblebums there are to quash other people&#39;s opinions. If 4chan copiers doesn&#39;t want to think that hard, perhaps he should just keep quiet. It&#39;s easy to tell if he&#39;s lying. If his lips are moving, he&#39;s lying.

4chan copiers deeply believes that everything he says is totally and thoroughly true. Meanwhile, back on Earth, the truth is very simple: 4chan copiers must sense his own irremediable inferiority. That&#39;s why he is so desperate to exploit the feelings of charity and guilt that many people have over the plight of the homeless; it&#39;s the only way for him to distinguish himself from the herd. It would be a lot nicer, however, if 4chan copiers also realized that no one likes being attacked by garrulous, blockish freaks. Even worse, 4chan copiers exploits our fear of those attacks -- which he claims will evolve by next weekend into biological, chemical, or nuclear attacks -- as a pretext to make serious dialogue difficult or impossible. If you think that&#39;s scary, then you should remember that I call upon 4chan copiers to stop his oppression, lies, immorality, and debauchery. I call upon him to be a man of manners, principles, honour, and purity. And finally, I call upon him to forgo his desire to put the foxes in charge of guarding the henhouse. As someone who enjoys brandishing words like &quot;interchangeableness&quot; and &quot;scientificophilosophical&quot; as a smoke screen to hide his communications&#39; inherent paradoxes, 4chan copiers must unquestionably be at a loss when someone presents a logical counterargument to his petulant, confused agendas. Let us now join hands, hearts, and minds to announce that we may need to picket, demonstrate, march, or strike to stop 4chan copiers before he can step on other people&#39;s toes. Never have I seen such a gross error in judgment as his decision to pander to our worst fears. He wants to siphon off scarce international capital intended for underdeveloped countries. Faugh.

4chan copiers thinks it would be a great idea to impose a one-size-fits-all model on how society should function. Even if we overlook the logistical impossibilities of such an idea, the underlying premise is still flawed. For what it&#39;s worth, just because he and his representatives don&#39;t like being labelled as &quot;unenlightened shirkers&quot; or &quot;pernicious cult leaders&quot; doesn&#39;t mean the shoe doesn&#39;t fit. Although 4chan copiers obviously hates my guts (and probably yours, as well), the illaudable and deranged nature of 4chan copiers&#39;s perceptions should indicate to us that something needs to be done. That&#39;s something you won&#39;t find in your local newspaper because it&#39;s the news that just doesn&#39;t fit.

4chan copiers either is or elects to be ignorant of scientific principles and methods. He even intentionally misuses scientific terminology to progressively enlarge and increasingly centralize the means of oppression, exploitation, violence, and destruction. To simplify, griping about 4chan copiers will not make him stop trying to focus too much on one side of the equation and not enough on the broader perspective of things. But even if it did, he would just find some other way to create some incoherent, pseudo-psychological profile of me to discredit my opinions.

Even when the facts don&#39;t fit, 4chan copiers sometimes tries to use them anyway. He still maintains, for instance, that the best way to serve one&#39;s country is to make bigotry respectable. From this perspective, his beliefs (as I would certainly not call them logically reasoned arguments) are out of step with democratic practices of equity and fair play. To cap that off, this is not the place to develop that subject. It demands many pages of analysis, which I can&#39;t spare in this letter. Instead, I&#39;ll just state the key point, which is that like a verbal magician, he knows how to lie without appearing to be lying, how to bury secrets in mountains of garbage-speak. The dominant characteristic of 4chan copiers&#39;s warped rejoinders is not that they ridicule the accomplishments of generations of great men and women, but that, in the bargain, they judge people based solely on hearsay. 4chan copiers thinks that we can stop classism merely by permitting government officials entrée into private homes to search for reprehensible dirtbags. Of course, thinking so doesn&#39;t make it so.

I don&#39;t mean to scare you, but unlike 4chan copiers, when I make a mistake I&#39;m willing to admit it. Consequently, if -- and I&#39;m bending over backwards to maintain the illusion of &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; -- he were not actually responsible for trying to scupper my initiative to challenge his muzzy-headed assumptions about merit, then I&#39;d stop saying that I have a dream, a mission, a set path that I would like to travel down. Specifically, my goal is to create greater public understanding of the damage caused by 4chan copiers&#39;s op-ed pieces. Of course, I have resisted taking legal action against him, as others have advised me to do. If that fact hurts, get over it; it&#39;s called reality. And for another dose of reality, consider that 4chan copiers is absolutely unbalanced. We all are, to some extent, but he sets the curve. 4chan copiers claims that our unalienable rights are merely privileges that he can dole out or retract. This is a very nutty and unconstructive view and moreover, is wrong in many ways.

4chan copiers&#39;s &quot;I&#39;m right and you&#39;re wrong&quot; attitude is huffy, because it leaves no room for compromise. 4chan copiers has declared that he&#39;s staging a revolt against everyone who wants to improve the living conditions of the most vulnerable in our society -- the sick, the old, the disabled, the unemployed, and our youth -- all of whose lives are made miserable by 4chan copiers. 4chan copiers&#39;s revolting all right; the very sight of him turns my stomach. All kidding aside, he dreams of a time when he&#39;ll be free to promote, foster, and institute prætorianism. That&#39;s the way he&#39;s planned it, and that&#39;s the way it&#39;ll happen -- not may happen, but will happen -- if we don&#39;t interfere, if we don&#39;t shield people from his two-faced and lethargic deceptions. Anyway, I hope I&#39;ve made my point, which is that the wisdom that comes from maturation of the spirit, mind, and body will some day prevail over the idiocy of 4chan copiers&#39;s philosophies.

Keep this forum and 4chan seperate from each other. Thank you.
