    <description>Can anyone help me with a code that does sendMessageToAll for a certain player rights? So that you can type in a code like ::yelltoadmin (substring here)

[code]    public void process() {
        if (messageToAll.length() &gt; 0) {
            int msgTo = 1;

            do {
                if (players[msgTo] != null) {
                    players[msgTo].globalMessage = messageToAll;
                }
                msgTo++;
            } while (msgTo &lt; maxPlayers);
            messageToAll = &quot;&quot;;
        }[/code]

That&#39;s the code for it in PlayerHandler. I&#39;m guessing you would have to change the part (msgTo &lt; maxPlayers) But I&#39;m not exactly sure how to do it. maxPlayers just seems like the amount of players online, but i don&#39;t know how to change it so that it sends it to the amount of admins online. Iv&#39;e been messing with this code for other things, like displaying mods online for the player menu, and sending interfaces to certain people. It&#39;s hard to put it all together. If anyone helps me out, it would be much appreciated. I&#39;ve been working on this stupid sort of thing for a while now.</description>
