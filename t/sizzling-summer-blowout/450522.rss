    <title>Sizzling Summer Blowout</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sizzling-summer-blowout/450522</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;To help sizzle up your summer, every day over the course of August and September, RuneScape members will receive a host of summer goodies. Be a member through all of August and receive 350,000 XP (at the end of the month) and an extra bonus spin every day! Stay a member throughout September too and we&#39;ll double it! That&#39;s 700,000XP and 2 extra spins every day in September.

To get you further into the summer mood, stay a member throughout August and September and you&#39;ll also receive 9 new customisation items, including a 5-piece Tropical Islander outfit, extra head &amp; cape accessories, a new title and even a wild Crab Transformation Dance emote! With over $45 worth of items and spins included, this really is a scorching Summer sensation!

Hot enough?

Well, if all of this wasn&#39;t enough, players who are members for the entirety of the Sizzling Summer (1st August GMT until 30th September GMT) will also have the envious chance to CHOOSE YOUR FATE!

CHOOSE YOUR FATE is a selection of four of the most powerful items ever seen in RuneScape. More exciting details on this next week! We promise you will not want to miss out on this and much much more…

Make sure you&#39;re a member throughout August and September to take part.

So keep calm and party on.

The RuneScape Team&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#39;m curious as to what exactly the CHOOSE YOUR FATE thing is. Either way, it looks like I&#39;m buying membership through September, as it seems fairly interesting.</description>

<p>It still is an extension and always will be. Getting bonus xp is no different than faster training methods members get. If you’re f2p, you lose out on things like this, and that’s how its always been.</p>

I suspect their will be limitations with this, i.e. with the mad necklace you had to wear it and gain xp. Then it’d be doubled, they will probably do that again or that’d be quite bullshit. Level 1 summoning to 70 from lamps for being members.<br>
[/quote]<br>
although that would suck with dungeoneering if it was a lamp because you wouldn’t get the tokens (I assume).[/quote]<br>
Its not all about the tokkens, 85 dung = frost drags etc. and when your a higher lvl you get more floors = more xp ph.<br>
I’m sure they’ll make it possible for you to use it with dg though.</p>
