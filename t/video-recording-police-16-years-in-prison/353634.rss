    <title>Video recording police: 16 years in prison</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/video-recording-police-16-years-in-prison/353634</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Anthony Graber, a Maryland Air National Guard staff sergeant, faces up to 16 years in prison. His crime? He videotaped his March encounter with a state trooper who pulled him over for speeding on a motorcycle. Then Graber put the video — which could put the officer in a bad light — up on YouTube.

It doesn&#39;t sound like much. But Graber is not the only person being slapped down by the long arm of the law for the simple act of videotaping the police in a public place. Prosecutors across the U.S. claim the videotaping violates wiretap laws — a stretch, to put it mildly.

These days, it&#39;s not hard to see why police are wary of being filmed. In 1991, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) beating of Rodney King was captured on video by a private citizen. It was shown repeatedly on television and caused a national uproar. As a result, four LAPD officers were put on trial, and when they were not convicted, riots broke out, leaving more than 50 people dead and thousands injured (two officers were later convicted on federal civil rights charges). (See TIME&#39;s special: &quot;15 Years After Rodney King.&quot;)

More recently, a New York Police Department officer was thrown off the force — and convicted of filing a false report — because of a video of his actions at a bicycle rally in Times Square. The officer can plainly be seen going up to a man on a bike and shoving him to the ground. The officer claimed the cyclist was trying to collide with him, and in the past, it might have been hard to disprove the police account. But this time there was an amateur video of the encounter — which quickly became an Internet sensation, viewed more than 3 million times on YouTube alone. (Read about the hidden side of the NYPD.)

In the Graber case, the trooper also apparently had reason to want to keep his actions off the Internet. He cut Graber off in an unmarked vehicle, approached Graber in plain clothes and yelled while brandishing a gun before identifying himself as a trooper.

Filming police should be encouraged to keep the few dishonest officers on their toes.
Its the same argument as for wikileaks really, it keeps those in power accountable.

Who remembers the british police killing Ian Tomlinson at the G20 protests in London? That murder would have been successfully covered up were it not for video recording.

Perhaps Frell and similar idiots will argue you shouldn&#39;t record police officers?


no reason for britfags to be smug, we have similar laws against videoing police.</description>

</aside>
<p>Well no, because he cut him off, got out the car with his gun, walked over to him, told him to get off his bike THEN said he was a police officer. All that time before knowing if the person walking at you with a gun before knowing their intention. I’m fairly sure police are trained to announce they are police immediately if they can’t be seen, it may not be obvious they are police or in this situation they are in plain clothes for the specific reason this was brought up.</p>
<p>What if he had a gun, for defensive reasons and pulled it out at him soon as he saw a guy walking towards him with the gun? That is why he should of announced himself as soon as he stepped out of the car with his gun.</p>

              <p>In the video he was behaving recklessly, reaching 127mph before doing a wheelie in a slow lane of traffic and next to a coach bus. It’s pretty obvious the trooper whether off-duty or plain clothes did what was right in the situation, and there was another trooper right behind him in a marked car. It wasn’t like the officer was pointing the gun at him, he had it pointed down, and he said he was a state trooper soon after he told him to get off the bike.</p>

<p>As for the person taping the whole situation, the ‘victim’, sure 16 years in jail sounds a bit extreme, and it doesn’t seem like any crime was committed as far as wire tapping goes. But it sounds to me like he was trying make a case of police brutality or something along those lines, just to get away with speeding and reckless endangerment. I definitely don’t know the law that well. But I think he should be fined for speeding (hefty fine in Maryland), and have the other charges dropped.</p>

              <p>Wait, was this guy a plain-clothes officer on-duty? Or off-duty? Sorry if this question was answered explicitly somewhere and I missed it, but I don’t think I did.</p>
<p>We have unmarked cars here in Australia, but the officers are in uniform.</p>
<p>However yes, I agree that what this guy did was a cuntish thing to do. He should be reprimanded if he was off-duty, and hopefully that will happen now that the story has reached the internet and the police department in question will have a tougher time playing the incident down.</p>

iirc no, along with not being allowed to drive their cop car off duty. Because if you’re off duty you dont want someone mistaking you for someone who is currently trying to look out for everyone.</p>

That guy is fucking asking to get shot by somebody like mopar.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Honestly, if I was driving down a road, a car cut me off and the guy jumped out running at me and pointing a gun at me, I probably would shoot him.  And if I didn’t have a video camera I’d probably be wrongfully sent to prison for killing a cop.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/video">@video</a> recording police, they all have cameras in their squad cars that record traffic stops and such, so if it’s legal for them to record themselves with us in a public place, surely it is legal for us to record the same interaction isn’t it?  It’s complete bullshit that it could be considered ‘illegal wiretapping’.[/quote]</p>
<p>At the last paragraph: I don’t see how the man could have been sent to prison for 16 years if he had even a semi-competent lawyer. That argument alone could get the man off.</p>

<p>For this exact reason, in fact - only a few years ago there was a big furore in the UK about police arresting people under Terrorism laws who filmed them on duty. The Met eventually put out a big show of informing their officers that this wasn’t acceptable, whether other forces did I don’t know.</p>
