    <title>[PI] Need help with object teleing (Want to have to stand next to it)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-need-help-with-object-teleing-want-to-have-to-stand-next-to-it/427467</link>
    <description>so basically, me and my co-owner decided to make something to tele you to runecrafting today instead of a person/actionbutton...
so we decided an object would be good. We were successful, however we have one problem.
When using this object to teleport to runecrafting, you can be anywhere and click on it, and it will tele you -_-

We thought this would be a little too easy on our players, so we worked for about 45 minutes, til he had to do something, and
I worked for about another 15 but couldn&#39;t get it right...

Here&#39;s our code 
[code=java]				case 2:
					c.getPA().startTeleport(3338, 3403, 0, &quot;modern&quot;);
				break;[/code]

I&#39;m sorry for something that would be this easy to some of you, but please understand that I tried MYSELF before asking for help. Thanks ;)</description>
