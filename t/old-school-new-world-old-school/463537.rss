New-World is a old scool classic pi that you cant find these days. We have most skills, and are adding quest. Our development thread is here: [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,566899.0.html]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,566899.0.html[/url]
We are in need of more help, as we want this server to be released as soon as possible and have weekly updates.
We expect you to know a fair amount of java knowledge.
You can apply for server developer, client developer, or web developer
