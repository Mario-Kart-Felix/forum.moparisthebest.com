              <p>Hi Echo Zero,</p>
<p>You have been caught attempting to steal another players password. This is a serious offence.</p>
<p>Our report abuse system means there is no chance of your getting away with breaking the rules anymore.</p>
<p>You have been permanently banned for password scamming.</p>
<p>You were caught saying the following:</p>
<p>echo_zero-&gt; Give me pass</p>
<p>This is against our rules regarding password scamming.</p>
<p>Please refer to article number 3 in the rules:</p>
<p>Rule 3: Asking/trying to persuade another player to give you their password for any reason is against the rules and will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>The login/logout IP data shows that no other user had access to your account at the time of this incident - we take password scamming very seriously and do not tolerate these players within Runescape.</p>
<p>You will NOT be unbanned.</p>
<p>[br][size=1]Posted at: June 15, 2006, 11:30:45 am[/size][hr]Dear Echo Zero,</p>
<p>I have checked our records and it seems that someone else may have had access to this account at the time of the offence. I have therefore removed the blackmarks from your record. Please submit a <em>Lost Password</em> query via the Customer Support section; we will reinstate the character to the game once we have issued a new, secure password.</p>
<p>Please can you fill out a password support form on the main page, and provide as much information as possible, so we can be sure we are returning the account to its rightful owner.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://www.runescape.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.runescape.com/</a>
</li>
<li>Under Other Features towards the bottom right of the main menu, click on Password Support.</li>
<li>Click on the Password Support link on the left.<br>
Read the instructions on how to fill in the form and remember to write down your query tracking ID.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is a good idea to make yourself aware, if you have not already done so, of the security tips in our online manual at <a href="http://www.runescape.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.runescape.com</a>. There are several handy hints for making sure your account remains secure in future.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
RuneScape Customer Support</p>
<hr>
<p>On 10th March 2005 you sent us the following:</p>
<p>I am insulted. I am a kind man who would never comit anything that would break rules of any kind. The only explanation is that my account is used by dear friends and I will personaly make sure they never try this again. If you do not “unbann” me then I understand, but know you have made a mistake.</p>
<hr>
<p>I used to pass word scam on a old account, damn good too. Anywho, Jagex is a bunch of idiots. I told them to check the IPs again for the time it happend and see if any other IPs were ever active. and since my bro played on it once; there was.</p>
<p>What Im trying to tell you is, if you get banned. Lie. They are stupid, and they will believe you.</p>
