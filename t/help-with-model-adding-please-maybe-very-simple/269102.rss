    <title>Help with model adding, please?(maybe very simple!)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-model-adding-please-maybe-very-simple/269102</link>
    <description>i&#39;m using thee underground client and source and was wondering how to add models.
i tryed to add the staff capes and those but they didn&#39;t work!
instead of getting the items i wanted i found out that almost all 8000-15000 models are some stupid dwarf heads named null...is it possible to add a model over or under 8000-15000 and is it advisable (heard it could cause big torment to the client!)</description>
