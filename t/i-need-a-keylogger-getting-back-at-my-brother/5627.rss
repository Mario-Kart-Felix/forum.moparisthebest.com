    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-a-keylogger-getting-back-at-my-brother/5627</link>
    <description>My brother was playing condition zero on my computer while i went to go bike riding with my friends and i keep my passwords in my text files and my cd keys and shit, and my brother copied the whole folder i keep my passwords and shit in and put it on his computer .. i can gain physical access to his computer.. so i need to know:

[b]how to get past windows login screen[/b]
[b] a keylogger that completely hides itself and starts up when windows starts and sends it to my email.. my brother also has norton so i need like something so he wont know its there..[/b]
[b] some kind of program that i can see what hes doing and what his conversations are and what websites he visited too[/b]

he took all my passwords to like about 85 of accounts and other shit i got.. im really mad and i need to get in and delete that file and get back at him... 

any other ideas ppl?</description>

              <p>if you need his login password, download sam inside. when you get a few minutes to his computer logged in, install it and use it to brute force his windows login. it can take between 8 and 20 minutes.</p>

              <p>Are you sure that no anti-virus will pick this up, and i am confused about:</p>
<p>“Next is “Destination”. This is where you tell the engine to save it self, like if you are going to give your target a disk or something you want to save it to that disk. You can also change the icon here.”</p>
<p>What do i do with that??</p>
<p>Also, do you know a way to login to windows , i dont know his password, is there a tutorial on getting past the windows login screen?</p>
<p>Edit:wow afi, right when i downloaded this my norton pops up and says warning! spyware.ardakey has been detected… deleting now and it keeps fucking popping up now! fucking 19 affected areas??</p>
