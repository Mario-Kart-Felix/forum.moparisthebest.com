    <title>Changing cache? [PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-cache-pi/534470</link>
    <description>Hiya, been a really long time since I&#39;ve messed with RSPS, wanted to start with something basic, which is a Project Insanity running a 319 cache and gameframe. Now, I&#39;ve seen tons of people do this and they say it&#39;s easy but I can&#39;t seem to find a tutorial. If anyone could walk me through it, even if it&#39;s just by text I&#39;d really appreciate it.

Also when I open PI up in eclipse it gives me a socket error of some sort, and I know I&#39;m setting it up correctly.

Thanks for looking.</description>

              <p>Socket error typically means that there is something already running on the port. Make sure you aren’t running the cmd and eclipse at the same time.<br>
The rest is client sided and should be asked in that section.</p>
