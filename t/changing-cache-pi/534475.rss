    <description>Accidentally posted in server help. 

Hiya, been a really long time since I&#39;ve messed with RSPS, wanted to start with something basic, which is a Project Insanity running a 319 cache and gameframe. Now, I&#39;ve seen tons of people do this and they say it&#39;s easy but I can&#39;t seem to find a tutorial. If anyone could walk me through it, even if it&#39;s just by text I&#39;d really appreciate it.

Thanks for looking.</description>
