    <title>Played on a server with a Auction house a while back?!</title>

    <description>Well I played this server a while back with an auction house to auction off items. It was a nice feature for the server and there wasa command to go there and then a command to put whatever item up for sale at whatever starting price and then bidding begins. I was wondering if it is about at all on these forums for me to add to my current server? Thanks a lot</description>
