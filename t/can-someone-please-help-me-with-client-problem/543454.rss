    <title>Can someone please help me with client problem?!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone-please-help-me-with-client-problem/543454</link>
    <description>When you run the client it says &quot;connect to server&quot; on the bar and then it says &quot;error loading.. please report!&quot;

I have also changed the JDK to the recent java I have when you edit the run.bat as well.

anyone problems? would any one be able to fix this problem on team viewer?

Thankyou scott.</description>
