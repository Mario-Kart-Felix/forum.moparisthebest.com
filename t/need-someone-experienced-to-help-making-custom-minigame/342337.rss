    <title>Need someone experienced to help, making custom minigame!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-someone-experienced-to-help-making-custom-minigame/342337</link>
    <description>MMkayy, so Im making a minigame on my server,HellRelm, where you and a bunch of other people fight and have 3 deaths until your out. last man standing wins and gets a custom skillcape.
Things I need help on:
I know how to make an interface walkable, but I cant find anything in my client to give me reference as to making it only in a certain area w/o all the declaring booleans and voids shit. I dont mind a few just not a shit load. I need a code like [code]if playerisin(absX, absY) do interface walkable blah blah blah[/code]
kinda like pest control. And if you dont mind, Id also like to know how to count the players deaths and to show whos in first place with the most lives when it comes down to the top 3.  get what I mean? please help, I neeeed it :)

and I also need help on whenever someone dies, if they have any amount of over 2m(anything worth more than their armor theyre wearing) the keep all of their money and drop all of their armor and such. This is a serious server im devo&#39;ing, so it need to fix this.
Ive tryed declaring voids like
[code]Public void keepitemCoins()
                   {
                   if (PlayerHasItem(995) == true);
                           {
                            deleteItem(995, getItemslot(995), 2147000000);
                             addItem(995, 3);
                             }
                   }

I had to type that by memory so it may be flawed lol just go with the flow[/code]
and add it to the keepItem(); list on Applydead(); and all it does is remove ALL the players items and add 3gp to the player
i think I may know whats messed up with it, I just dont know how to fix it.
It may think that the gold, not matter how much it is, is only 1 item all together instead of 3432452552452 items stacked, yah know?
Anyways, help would definatly be appriciated, ESPECIALLY on the first one.


THANKS :)</description>
