    <description>[center][b][size=16pt]What skill do you want to improve?[/size][/b][/center]

Hey, I&#39;m asking this question because I&#39;m tired of starting a project and then having it totally destroyed by everyone saying this is stupid and it won&#39;t work... So I decided to ask YOU what YOU want to do... So here&#39;s your chance to tell me what you want to do, and whichever is the best I&#39;ll work on the best that I can to improve... Because I&#39;m so fucking tired of you idiots telling me that this is going to fail! So here, tell me what you want! It&#39;s your chance now 


[center]About the Editing...[/center]
Okay, So what I meant by improve the skill was to make the skill better... By better I mean ...

[ul][li] Make the skill harder to level up on  [/li]
[li] Make it more interactive (ie. More Quests on this skill, pushing this skills agenda, making guilds for this skill  [/li]
[li] Make it personal (ie. Who can level up the fastest? Give rewards for this skill when you level up etc.)  [/li]
[li] Add everything about this skill from RuneScape into the server, and then some...  [/li]
[li] Make everything for the skill possible  [/li]
[li] Demand the skill more  [/li]
[li] Most importantly, make the skill fun...  [/li][/ul]


So I hope that cleared up what I meant by improve the skill, If you have any questions about the skills or the &quot;About the Editing&quot; section, please post a comment or send me a pm...</description>

Before I answer though, I noticed you had summoning on the list. Would this be a normal rs2 server?<br>
Or are you making a 508/503?</p>

              <p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">[size=16pt]What skill do you want to improve?[/size]</span>[/center]</p>
<p>Hey, I’m asking this question because I’m tired of starting a project and then having it totally destroyed by everyone saying this is stupid and it won’t work… So I decided to ask YOU what YOU want to do… So here’s your chance to tell me what you want to do, and whichever is the best I’ll work on the best that I can to improve… Because I’m so fucking tired of you idiots telling me that this is going to fail! So here, tell me what you want! It’s your chance now</p>
<p>[center]About the Editing…[/center]<br>
Okay, So what I meant by improve the skill was to make the skill better… By better I mean …</p>
<p>[ul][li] Make the skill harder to level up on  [/li]<br>
[li] Make it more interactive (ie. More Quests on this skill, pushing this skills agenda, making guilds for this skill  [/li]<br>
[li] Make it personal (ie. Who can level up the fastest? Give rewards for this skill when you level up etc.)  [/li]<br>
[li] Add everything about this skill from RuneScape into the server, and then some…  [/li]<br>
[li] Make everything for the skill possible  [/li]<br>
[li] Demand the skill more  [/li]<br>
[li] Most importantly, make the skill fun…  [/li][/ul]</p>
<p>So I hope that cleared up what I meant by improve the skill, If you have any questions about the skills or the “About the Editing” section, please post a comment or send me a pm…</p>
