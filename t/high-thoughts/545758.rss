    <title>High thoughts?</title>

    <description>Martin Garrix. I thought the guy was like 25 or something but nope. He&#39;s just a kid! He&#39;s 18, just a random thought I had.

Can you imagine. How is all this happening? Like, science or religion, but like. Look how far we&#39;ve come. We&#39;re still advancing. Humans. Rumors are we were apes. But look how smart we&#39;ve gotten. Now we invent shit that invents it self! Like robots. Humans made robots. Robots make other robots. Shiiit. Technology is evolving. Soon we&#39;ll be able to take a shit and it&#39;ll turn into pure clean breathable air. 

Speaking of air, Why is there nothing in space? Space is nothing. But like, how do we describe nothing. You can&#39;t just say there&#39;s &quot;nothing there&quot;. What&#39;s nothing? Nothing is just empty. But how do we know it&#39;s empty. There&#39;s nothing there? Or how was everything created. If nothing was there, how is everything made? Science or Religion, how was this all made. Where did the big bang come from, where did all this start? HOW did it start? How did we name the color &quot;red&quot;, red? Why couldn&#39;t it be called clarx? How are we attracted to boobs? Boobs is just some round squishy shit on a woman&#39;s chest. And a penis? That shit&#39;s just a hanging lump thing. Speaking of body parts, how the fuck do we have so much stuff inside of us? Like, it&#39;s not just one simple running organ, noooooo, we got like so much shit inside us. God damn.

Whatchu guys got? High/stoned thoughts?
&quot;What the fuck are you smoking, Goudont, I want some of that.&quot;</description>

<p>Short and good to read. Quite interesting.</p>
<p>Usually, when we all take a dump with nothing to do, we read the back of shampoo bottles. But that’s general, high thoughts most of the time for me, are looking into each of the words and getting lost in thought lmao</p>

              <p>Sometimes I really question how much longer the Earth really has. With all the political lies and everything, how long will it be until resources truly become scarce and the countries begin preparing to invade each other in order to survive? The odds of us finding a new host for human beings to take over is probably unlikely. It would take generations of change before we even begin to see changes in everything from water salinity, changes in global temperature, the unnecessary overpopulation of the human race, car emissions, etc. We would have to begin looking at clean, alternative fuel sources for both household and transportation, some sort of breeding restriction… But of course we as a species are unwilling to stop being greedy and work towards the longevity of our planet, because fuck the future generations right?</p>
