    <description>Hi,

     I need help from someone because I&#39;m baffled on anyway to fix my computer. My computer was running slow, I had extracted a virus from a key generator but norton had said it had taken care of it, and i decided it was time for a reformat and install of windows. I downloaded windows xp pro sp3, and burned an image file. Even though I burned it as an image, I couldnt boot from it on my pc, so I went back and extracted the image, and burnt those files. Once putting that cd on my pc, I was able to start installation. Once it got to the part of restarting and going to the dos version of the setup, it gives me a prompt to go to windows xp setup, or windows xp. Once it goes to windows xp setup, I just get a flashing dos cursor, and nothing happens. Here&#39;s the even worse part, I&#39;ve found that I can&#39;t use my arrow keys in the boot up process. At first I thought it was my keyboard, so I wasted $20 on a new one. This new keyboard has let me use the arrow keys, it just wont move up. I know this because the 5 second timer that comes up before it tries to boot to the xp setup disappears after I press the up arrow, but won&#39;t go up. I then decided to burn a copy of windows vista and try this. I got into bios and at first, was not able to use my arrow keys. After shutting off my pc for sometime and retrying, I was able. I set the boot process to my cd drive first and made sure that I was set for usb keyboards in the integrated peripherals section. The boot up process offers to take me to boot from the vista cd, but is just followed by a flashing cursor.

Please help, I&#39;m at loss for what I can do to fix this, and trying to save my self a visit to the geeksquad.</description>

              <p>Are you using a ps/2 keyboard? On your motherboard what cmos setting are the little jumpers on?<br>
Best solution is get a Linux live CD, reformat hard drive and start again.<br>
Dont go to Geeksquad because your using an illegal Windows CD so they wont help you.</p>
