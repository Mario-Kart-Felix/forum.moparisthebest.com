    <description>Hi,

I&#39;m currently refactoring and attempting to improve a TestScape source to help me learn Java, Java design patterns and how the private server works.

Currently, I have a few major improvements I want to add in the future:


[ul][li]A move to Apache MINA or better socket library.[/li]
[li]Change from process() methods to an event handler / queue.[/li][/ul]


What else could be improved in TestScape (in terms of basic workings of the server, not things like buggy skills or combat)?</description>
