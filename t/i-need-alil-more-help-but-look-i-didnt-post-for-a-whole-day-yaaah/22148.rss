    <description>I dont know how to create a new admin because some said to search for admin list. He said there&#39;d be a list of names and there wasn&#39;t   ?=/   and this is what i got.

//start of moderator/admin list, 1 = mod, 2 = staff, 3 = admin



checkmods();
checkadmins();
checkstaff();
if(checkmods() == 5)
playerRights = 1;
if(checkadmins() == 5)
playerRights = 2;

I am sorry that I am a noob and someday I will have a server of glory! GLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORY!!!!!!!!!!</description>
