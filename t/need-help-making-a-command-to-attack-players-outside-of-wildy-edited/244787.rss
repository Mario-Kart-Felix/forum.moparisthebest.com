    <title>Need Help Making A Command To Attack Players Outside Of Wildy (EDITED)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-making-a-command-to-attack-players-outside-of-wildy-edited/244787</link>
    <description>I thought this would work. I tried this.

[code]	} if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;pwnage&quot;)){
                    AttackingOn = inStream.readSignedWordBigEndian();
                    IsAttacking = true;
                    inCombat();
         sendMessage(&quot;MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!&quot;);
[/code]

I used a bunch of combinations of codes that had to do with my wildy. I&#39;m pretty sure this is my wildy code.

[code]case 73: // Attack (Wilderness)
            if (PkingDelay &lt;= 1) {
                AttackingOn = inStream.readSignedWordBigEndian();
                client plz = (client) server.playerHandler.players[AttackingOn];

                if (!nonWild() &amp;&amp; !plz.nonWild() &amp;&amp; plz != null) {
                    IsAttacking = true;
                    inCombat();
                    plz.inCombat();
                    if (GoodDistance(absX, absY, EnemyX, EnemyY, 1) == true) {
                        setAnimation(GetWepAnim());
                    } else {}
                    if (server.playerHandler.players[AttackingOn] != null) {
                        if (server.playerHandler.players[AttackingOn].absX
                                != absX
                                        &amp;&amp; server.playerHandler.players[AttackingOn].absY
                                                != absY) {
                            viewTo(
                                    server.playerHandler.players[AttackingOn].absX,
                                    server.playerHandler.players[AttackingOn].absY);
                        }
                        faceNPC = 32768 + AttackingOn;
                        faceNPCupdate = true;
                    }
                }
            }
            break;[/code]

Can someone tell me what I am doing wrong? (And is this ok Hasumon?)</description>

<p>1.) Admins can abuse it if they get pissed off at someone… lol even though you know em<br>
2.) Just do that ‘eat’ thing that everyone did. Somewhat like this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">        if (command.startsWith("eat") &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt; 2) {
            String nam = command.substring(4);

            setAnimation(829);
        }</code></pre>
<p>P.S. I pulled that out of some server.<br>
Much faster and easier though could be massively improved.<br>

<p>I have that. I don’t like using it though. I want them to see I’m attacking.[/quote]<br>
…couldn’t they get away easily from you/admins? lul Anyways to do what you want to do it would be similar to like this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public boolean adminkilling = false;</code></pre>
<p>need that declared in ‘player.java’ then</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">case 73: // Attack (Wilderness)

<p>use this to replace your old one and then</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">        if (command.startsWith("adminkilling") &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; adminkilling) {
            adminkilling = false;

            adminkilling = true;
            sendMessage("Player killing set to true");
        }</code></pre>
<p>add that into your commands section.<br>
Type the command to make it true or false. This is pulled directly out of my hole btw, that explains the poor conventions, coding, and w-e but try this base and work your way up ;p</p>

              <p>What the heck are you trying to do? Attack someone from outside the wild zone? Doesn’t that defeat the purpose of a safe zone? (your title)<br>
and who would use this (in your server)… yourself to kill looters or what?</p>
