    <title>Are we really dead?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/are-we-really-dead/428867</link>
    <description>When you die, theres 7 seconds in which you are in a dream state. You&#39;re unconsciously conscious. However, while dreaming, we lose all perception of time. A day could be a minute, a second could be a year. So what if you&#39;ve been dead for 3 seconds and all of your life up till now has been a dream... If you could grasp that concept, then you could enter a lucid dream state. A state in which you can control your environment. It would be as though you have entered the matrix.

So, everybody knows there&#39;s tons of theories out there. Some of the theories are that life Is just a dream and that we are already dead.

As the paragraph stated above, If you were aware that your life is just a dream, then you could control the the dream.

              <p>[quote=“Taharok, post:2, topic:428867”]Where is your proof of this special consciousness pre-mortem? If someone is shot in the head, are they going to have those 7 seconds? If we’re dreaming, why are we still subject to laws of nature, pain, etc. Real dreaming rarely has pain, unless we consciously want it. In the real world, few people actually look for pain. This is completely backward to dreaming.</p>
<p>The theory just sounds like weak solipsism to me, as a means to get “people thinking.”[/quote]</p>
<p>The problem with that is the fact that you’re still thinking conventionally.<br>
Your thought process is still allowing itself to be subjugated by the rules of the reality we’ve apparently created for ourselves.</p>
<p>If we’re indeed in our own reality, the absolute reality may be drastically different.<br>
In-fact, we could be a different species, the world as we know it could be non-existent.<br>
Virtually everything could be a radical obfuscation of the one we’ve forgotten.</p>
<p>Everything from the colour of the sky, if there truly is such a thing, to the hard elements could be a wisp of creativity in our minds.</p>
<p>In theory, we could be in an instanced reality created by our minds in the 7 seconds before death, the life beforehand could even have been the product of another such phenomenon, many times over.</p>
<p>The fact remains, reality is what we make of it.<br>
Simply electrical impulses interpreted by the brain.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there are very few reason to even desire escape from The Matrix.<br>
I mean, honestly the movies are a bit ludicrous.</p>
<p>“Yes! We’ve conquered the machines! The planet with scorched skies is ours! We can finally live in our caves in peace!”</p>
<p>I’d rather live in The Matrix comfortably, than escape.<br>
Although, if I was like Popper I’d definitely want to escape.</p>

Surprised that this thread is still going.  After our brains shut down, we see, feel, and hear nothing, or at least we can’t comprehend it.  Our brain controls all of our bodies functions, and after it stops, they also stop.  Religion has always been used to answer the unanswerable, and death is basically the final unknown.<br>

<p>we just die.  the brain is like a kernel.  if the brain doesn’t work, our body won’t do anything–it’s just a bag of organs.  unless doctors discover an eternal living soul in our body, this is the belief/pretty-much-a-fact i will stick with.  what’s the problem?</p>

<p>So what I’ve been saying is that, you died in your “previous” life, and now your in that 7 second dream state, but since time ISN’T constant, your entire life up until now could be part of that dream, and only be a couple seconds into it.</p>
<p>Also, someone said you’d be able to see flying pigs or whatever. Maybe things in this dream are weird but we don’t recognize them as weird because we see them all the time, In the dream within a dream, you see flying pigs etc etc, but to the people in the dream, its usually not weird.</p>

<p>Are you saying that there must be some way to manipulate “reality” as it is a dream?<br>
(I believe the brain is capable of doing much more, such as telekinesis.) Or are you saying we cannot achieve more than what we can now in reality?</p>
<p>I don’t think “dream” is the right word to describe our reality. I believe there is something way beyond us (God) that we cannot comprehend, but if you think about it, we don’t really understand our reality as well.</p>

Although you could say we’re already dead and simply in a dream like state, even if we are, we still can’t alter the reality that we live in.  We will still continue living in this state as if it we were alive in another world.  Even if we’re dead in one life, that’s irrelevant to the reality that you’re in now, because <span class="bbcode-b">you can’t change it</span>.<br>
