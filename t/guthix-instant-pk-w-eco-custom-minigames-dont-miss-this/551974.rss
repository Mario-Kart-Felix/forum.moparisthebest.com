Summer is here and its time to PK!

[SIZE=5]www.Guthix-Rsps.com[/SIZE][/CENTER]

Guthix seeks to appeal to the Rsps community interested in four things:


[ul][*]That Good Old 317 Revision w/ The new items you love!

[*]Instant PvPing!

[*]Custom Minigames ~ conceptualized by the community!

[*]A good Economy to promote growth[/ul]


[CENTER][SIZE=5]We Are Instant PVP[/SIZE]

[SIZE=5]What we do differently:[/SIZE]

Guthix is based on a popular 317 rsps which we&#39;ve hosted in the past with great success, What we aim to do 
differently this time is to fine tune gameplay so as to provide f2p Players the same ability to gain access to the 
various gear and zones available to Server Supporting players based on a pk kill count system, through this system
players will advance through ingame ranks based on pk kills while recieving numerous titles, icons, and abilities.

[/CENTER]

[SIZE=5]Custom Minigames[/SIZE]

Guthix&#39;s main focus is creating new content, the server is now launching in beta so this section will be continuously updated
 updated but our first new minigame series is based on &quot;Call of Duty&quot; Wager match games beginning with the &quot;Gun Game&quot;
Our version is known as &quot;Arsenal&quot; And utilizes bows, a one click shoot system with disabled auto retaliate and care packages to recreate the Gun Game experience.

[SIZE=5]Game Play Video Soon![/SIZE]

Dev Team Needed!
Guthix will be constantly looking for new developers with creative ideas for future minigames and content, persons with any form of skills should feel free to approac us as we are eager to hear your ideas.

Note: Please refrain from commenting negatively, regardless of what issues you see now, our plans for Guthix probably already have them in consideration and we will try to rectify them, we don&#39;t plan to be a short term server as we hope to grow into an iconic server throughout the RsPs Community.[/CENTER]

<p>I have to say this is just a typical PI PVP server in my opinion. Nothing spectacular if you ask me. And if your players actually think that this is a “good old 317” then they don’t have a clue what they’re talking about.</p>

<p>Nope. It is just a typical, non-unique, PI PVP server which has been created literally <span class="bbcode-b">1 million times</span> before you. The fact you think that your server is an old 317 shows you don’t really know what you’re talking about. There is nothing on your thread that stands out/unique/would make me interested in playing this.</p>
<p>If you can’t handle comments, then you are going to be a dreadful owner.[/quote]</p>
<p>Every server I’ve made thus far has been successful until someone comes along with the intentions of destroying it,<br>
If the starting thread of a new RsPS already presents evidence of custom content in terms of minigames it should be obvious that it will be unique in the long run.<br>
If you’re going to use my comments of the server being a “Good old 317” You have to take into consideration the context, this is what my player base sees as a “Good old 317” This is not my main forum account, If you wish to see evidence of my reputation and past work feel free to contact me via skype - “bobopvp”, I just hate to see these kind of comments as they’re in no way constructive, you probably haven’t even played the server you just look at the first draft of an advertisement thread i posted up and decided to judge my work and tarnish the servers reputation so early, it makes me sick that this is what the Moparscape community has come too.</p>
<p>1 Billion people have done this before you say, Yes many people start a server, but as a person who has been so successful in the past obviously I can do something differently, and in time you will see that this isn’t just a load of BS and i’m not a “Dreadful owner”</p>
<p>P.S Not going to proof read so ignore typos.</p>
