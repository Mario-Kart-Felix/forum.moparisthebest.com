              <p>I don’t see how you get off calling me a dumb ass, when clearly you stole someones work, claimed it as yours, and didn’t even correctly label it. Excuses excuses. Obviously you were looking for praise. Otherwise you wouldn’t have posted such shitty stuff. You thought it was cool, but it turns out they’re both terrible, and one of them isn’t even yours. Just a hint, if you’re going to steal something, at least choose something worth while.</p>

              <p>[quote=“ThAt0n36Uy, post:4, topic:185156”]Wow, you’re cool, you can make a black background with some pictures on it, with a nice bit of text. All you did was take a C4D or something and place it in the background, take a render, duplicate it, set it to motion blur on 120%, and add some text with outer glow.</p>
<p>The neutron is pretty bad quality. The circles and other shapes have white edges around them. The white background is very distracting in it. All in all it was a nice shot at making an atom. But the quality is very bad. Most people wouldn’t sit there and take the time to make something like that from scratch, if you in fact did.</p>

<p>Wow, He was being real nice. At least he didn’t give you a 0. And I can see where you’re coming from That0. Cause When I first saw it it looked like it had been done in like 5 mins or so. But That means that you can improve the image and that it’s not a complete failure entirely. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
