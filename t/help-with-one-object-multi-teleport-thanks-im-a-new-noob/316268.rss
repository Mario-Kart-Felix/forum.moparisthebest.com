    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-one-object-multi-teleport-thanks-im-a-new-noob/316268</link>
    <description>hello,

everytime I posted this either I got no replay or I didn&#39;t understand what to do with the code.

So please if you read this please tell me the code and where to add it. 

What I want to do:
I want to make one door with the same object id teleport you inside and outside? So when you click it once you go inside the building when you click it again you go outside, I am using a allstar source and if anyone can help me it would be appreciated!

thanks,
me :D![br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 26, 2009, 09:09:18 am[/size][hr]any help would be appreciated :D! Thanks!</description>
