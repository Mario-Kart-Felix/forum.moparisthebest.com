    <description>[size=10pt][b]ARYAN TUTORIAL - CREDITS TO ME (PIMJONG)[/b][/size]

If you want to use Aryan, you have to do a few things:
[size=10pt]
1. Install Java[/size]
First download the newest Java JDK. Click on the link below and choose the following download: JDK 5.0 Update 6 (without NetBeans, that&#39;s a lot faster).
[url=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp]DOWNLOAD HERE[/url]
When it is downloaded install it, if you dont know how to install, i recommend you buy a &quot;How to use Windows&quot; book :P.
Then go to start, click on Control Panel, open System, click on the Advanced tab and open Environment Variables.
Double click on Path under Systemvariables. you will probably see some paths. Add this on the end: [code]C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_06\bin;[/code]
Dont forget to put an semicolon ( ; ) at the end!!!
Now Java is working, now we are on to download and install Aryan.

[size=10pt]2. Install Aryan[/size]
Go to some forum where you can find Aryan. There you must download the newest version of Aryan. Once you downloaded it, open the .RAR file with WinRar or WinAce, and unpack it in a map on the desktop, or wherever you want. You can download WinRar from [url=http://www.rarlabs.com]rarlabs.com[/url] and WinAce from [url=http://www.winace.com]winace.com[/url]

[size=10pt]3. Use Aryan[/size]
To start Aryan, you have to doubleclick on Run-Bot.bat. Once you have done that, a MS-DOS screen will open and you will see some text on it. Then you will see a screen like in RuneScape, but without banners and ads, and there aren&#39;t buttons like show the RuneScape map etc...
Now you can just login with your normal RuneScape username and password, or make a new one (to make a new one click on File, Create Account). Now you will see that you are in the RuneScape world!

[size=10pt]4. Scripts[/size]
Woow, you opened Aryan, you are now in the RuneScape world, but you want to do the thing where you downloaded Aryan for. Cheating in RuneScape! To do this, you have to activate a script. A script is a piece of text in Java what will automate tasks for you. To activate a script, you have to type in the normal RuneScape chat a code. Here is a list of availabe codes:
[code]/chickens(*) This will activate the chicken script, with that script Aryan will kill chickens. On the place where stands an asterix, *, you have to type if you want to use attack, strength or defense. Example: /chickens(attack)
/chop() This will activate the chop script, Aryan will chop trees for you.
/dnetPower() This will activate the Draynor Powerfish script, it will fish and drop the fish for experience.
/dnetBank() This wil activate the Draynor Fish script with banking.
/em() This will activate the Essense Miner.
/minePower(*) This will activate the Lumbridge Miner. Where the Asterix * is you have to put the type of ore you want to mine. It will drop the ores.
/mineBank(*) Works the same as the script before, except that it will bank the ores.[/code]

There are more scripts, but if you want to know the code of another script just ask it here or pm me.
To add new scripts, put the downloaded script in the map Scripts. Then you have to compile it, to do you just click on Compile-Scripts.bat

[size=10pt]5. Controllers[/size]
Some people are REALLY lazy, and dont even want to type in the commands for scripts, they want that Aryan does really EVERYTHING for them. For those people, we also have CONTROLLERS.
A controller is another java and class. In that file are some commands which will start a new script, and if you reach some level it will start another script. Example: The controller let you walk trough tutorial island, if that is done it might get your combat to level 6 or something, and then it could do rune mysterie quest and then go mining some essence.
That can all be done with just 1 little controller.
First, when you got an controller (or use the one that is allready in the Aryan version), you have to compile it. Uuh, how do you compile a controller? Well, i have the code of Nerices one here, hope i may post it, else you can delete it...
[code]@echo off
javac -cp .;./../BotClasses;./../OUTPUT;./../OUTPUT/unrenamed.jar *.java
pause[/code]
Copy and paste it in notepad or some other editor, and save it as an .bat file in the controllers map. Now doubleclick that batch file and it will compile your controller.
Then the controller is ready to use, but then is the question: how to use it then?
Just open defaults.txt in the Configs map and edit the text after Controller and after Username.
Example:
[code]# valid properties:
username=thisismyusername
password=andhereismypassword
#   server=76
#   script=rminePower(copper)
#   graphics=[true|false]
controller=controllerName
#   lamp=runecraft
#   breaks=Configs/mybreaks.txt[/code]
As you can see, when you start Aryan it will automaticly log you in and start the controller and scripts.
In this defaults file you can also change the server and things.

[size=10pt]6. Proxy&#39;s[/size]
Many cheaters are talking about proxy&#39;s. Maybe you know what it is, maybe you dont. Well, a proxy is some kind of protection to hide your ip. It can be very good to hide your ip, because if JaGeX knows that you are cheating, they will get your ip and ban all your accounts. Except if you have a proxy!
To set up a proxy, you will have to find a proxy.
There are many lists of proxys, one of them is [url=http://www.proxy4free.com/page1.html]This One[/url].
You can check if they are working with [url=http://www.proxyway.com/www/downloads/]ProxyWay[/url].
The program is very easy to understand, it also has a guide. The ProxyWay guide is [url=http://www.proxyway.com/www/anonymous-web-browsing-free/Different/ProxyWayGuide.html]HERE[/url].
Once you have found and checked an proxy, you will have to let Aryan use  it. To do, you have to open Run-Bot.bat and change it.
Change it to:
[code]@echo off
title Running Bot WITH PROXY
java -DsocksProxyHost=00.000.000.000 -DsocksProxyPort=0000-noverify -Xmx500m -cp .;./OUTPUT;./OUTPUT/unrenamed.jar;./BotClasses; Bot
pause[/code].
Change the zero&#39;s to the proxy you want to use, and save run-bot.bat.
The next time you run Aryan, it will use a proxy.

For questions, ask it in this topic, or you can pm me![size=9][/size]

[size=1]please make it a sticky :P[/size]</description>

<p>The first set of numbers is the IP # and the second (after the “:”) is the port #. Just copy and paste like this:</p>

              <p>[size=10pt]<span class="bbcode-b">ARYAN TUTORIAL - CREDITS TO ME (PIMJONG)</span>[/size]</p>
<p>If you want to use Aryan, you have to do a few things:<br>
[size=10pt]</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Java[/size]<br>
First download the newest Java JDK. Click on the link below and choose the following download: JDK 5.0 Update 6 (without NetBeans, that’s a lot faster).<br>
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">DOWNLOAD HERE</a><br>
When it is downloaded install it, if you dont know how to install, i recommend you buy a “How to use Windows” book :P.<br>
Then go to start, click on Control Panel, open System, click on the Advanced tab and open Environment Variables.<br>
Double click on Path under Systemvariables. you will probably see some paths. Add this on the end: <code>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_06\bin;</code><br>
Dont forget to put an semicolon ( ; ) at the end!!!<br>
Now Java is working, now we are on to download and install Aryan.</li>
</ol>
<p>[size=10pt]2. Install Aryan[/size]<br>
Go to some forum where you can find Aryan. There you must download the newest version of Aryan. Once you downloaded it, open the .RAR file with WinRar or WinAce, and unpack it in a map on the desktop, or wherever you want. You can download WinRar from <a href="http://www.rarlabs.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">rarlabs.com</a> and WinAce from <a href="http://www.winace.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">winace.com</a></p>
<p>[size=10pt]3. Use Aryan[/size]<br>
To start Aryan, you have to doubleclick on Run-Bot.bat. Once you have done that, a MS-DOS screen will open and you will see some text on it. Then you will see a screen like in RuneScape, but without banners and ads, and there aren’t buttons like show the RuneScape map etc…<br>
Now you can just login with your normal RuneScape username and password, or make a new one (to make a new one click on File, Create Account). Now you will see that you are in the RuneScape world!</p>
<p>[size=10pt]4. Scripts[/size]<br>
Woow, you opened Aryan, you are now in the RuneScape world, but you want to do the thing where you downloaded Aryan for. Cheating in RuneScape! To do this, you have to activate a script. A script is a piece of text in Java what will automate tasks for you. To activate a script, you have to type in the normal RuneScape chat a code. Here is a list of availabe codes:</p>
<p><code>/chickens(*) This will activate the chicken script, with that script Aryan will kill chickens. On the place where stands an asterix, *, you have to type if you want to use attack, strength or defense. Example: /chickens(attack)
/chop() This will activate the chop script, Aryan will chop trees for you.
/dnetPower() This will activate the Draynor Powerfish script, it will fish and drop the fish for experience.
/dnetBank() This wil activate the Draynor Fish script with banking.
/em() This will activate the Essense Miner.
/minePower(*) This will activate the Lumbridge Miner. Where the Asterix * is you have to put the type of ore you want to mine. It will drop the ores.
/mineBank(*) Works the same as the script before, except that it will bank the ores.</code></p>
<p>There are more scripts, but if you want to know the code of another script just ask it here or pm me.<br>
To add new scripts, put the downloaded script in the map Scripts. Then you have to compile it, to do you just click on Compile-Scripts.bat</p>
<p>[size=10pt]5. Controllers[/size]<br>
Some people are REALLY lazy, and dont even want to type in the commands for scripts, they want that Aryan does really EVERYTHING for them. For those people, we also have CONTROLLERS.<br>
A controller is another java and class. In that file are some commands which will start a new script, and if you reach some level it will start another script. Example: The controller let you walk trough tutorial island, if that is done it might get your combat to level 6 or something, and then it could do rune mysterie quest and then go mining some essence.<br>
That can all be done with just 1 little controller.<br>
First, when you got an controller (or use the one that is allready in the Aryan version), you have to compile it. Uuh, how do you compile a controller? Well, i have the code of Nerices one here, hope i may post it, else you can delete it…</p>
<p><code>@echo off
javac -cp .;./../BotClasses;./../OUTPUT;./../OUTPUT/unrenamed.jar *.java
pause</code><br>
Copy and paste it in notepad or some other editor, and save it as an .bat file in the controllers map. Now doubleclick that batch file and it will compile your controller.<br>
Then the controller is ready to use, but then is the question: how to use it then?<br>
Just open defaults.txt in the Configs map and edit the text after Controller and after Username.<br>
Example:</p>
<p>[code]# valid properties:<br>
username=thisismyusername<br>
password=andhereismypassword</p>
<h1>server=76</h1>
<h1>script=rminePower(copper)</h1>
<h1>graphics=[true|false]</h1>
<p>controller=controllerName</p>
<h1>lamp=runecraft</h1>
<h1>breaks=Configs/mybreaks.txt[/code]</h1>
<p>As you can see, when you start Aryan it will automaticly log you in and start the controller and scripts.<br>
In this defaults file you can also change the server and things.</p>
<p>[size=10pt]6. Proxy’s[/size]<br>
Many cheaters are talking about proxy’s. Maybe you know what it is, maybe you dont. Well, a proxy is some kind of protection to hide your ip. It can be very good to hide your ip, because if JaGeX knows that you are cheating, they will get your ip and ban all your accounts. Except if you have a proxy!<br>
To set up a proxy, you will have to find a proxy.<br>
There are many lists of proxys, one of them is <a href="http://www.proxy4free.com/page1.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">This One</a>.<br>
You can check if they are working with <a href="http://www.proxyway.com/www/downloads/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">ProxyWay</a>.<br>
The program is very easy to understand, it also has a guide. The ProxyWay guide is <a href="http://www.proxyway.com/www/anonymous-web-browsing-free/Different/ProxyWayGuide.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">HERE</a>.<br>
Once you have found and checked an proxy, you will have to let Aryan use  it. To do, you have to open Run-Bot.bat and change it.<br>
Change it to:</p>
<p><code>@echo off
title Running Bot WITH PROXY
java -DsocksProxyHost=00.000.000.000 -DsocksProxyPort=0000-noverify -Xmx500m -cp .;./OUTPUT;./OUTPUT/unrenamed.jar;./BotClasses; Bot
pause</code>.<br>
Change the zero’s to the proxy you want to use, and save run-bot.bat.<br>
The next time you run Aryan, it will use a proxy.</p>
<p>For questions, ask it in this topic, or you can pm me![size=9][/size]<br>

[size=1]please make it a sticky :P[/size]</p>
