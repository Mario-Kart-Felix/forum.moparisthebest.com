    <title>LiaC MORPG Development</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/liac-morpg-development/281961</link>
    <description>Turned into a development topic for my game.

Well, I&#39;ve been working on a game for a bit, and I&#39;m proud with how it&#39;s coming. The game is text-based, but has buttons and other common Windows controls you&#39;d find in other programs (Such as text &amp; combo boxes). It&#39;s being written in C# .NET using the .NET Framework 2.0 for compatibility. Here is where you can catch the news for it.

The LiaC server has been completely rewritten, though only the core was really changed. This included stability, speed (Now 3 threads total verses the previous 5), and code neatness.

The server also has a better multiplayer system, and is much easier for me (Before, I for some reason used 2 variables; one for the socket indexes and one for the players... Both were terrible and would have overwritten previous player connections.) This one, instead of continuing from the last filled player slot, searches for an open one and uses that.

The IO system is still the same; easy to write and read. I&#39;ve also added an item database. Basically, it&#39;s like the item configuration in the RuneScape cache, except mine&#39;s not a binary file and is loaded from the server :). The item configuration only sets the price, the use options, if it has the ability to be equipped, the description, and the name. Other things like equipment stats will be loaded from a separate file.

It also has a packet timer, which when hits 3, logs the other user out. This goes for the client; when it hits 3, the client&#39;s main window closes and goes to the login screen.

So now the client development. It&#39;s coming along good. I&#39;ve added the inventory little group, and the &quot;Use Item&quot; window. I&#39;ve also added packet sending, and item requesting.

Right now, LiaC&#39;s inventory system is being added. Testing with a friend showed me that it was my computer that only got the problem, where it worked fine for him. I guess that also means it&#39;s fully functional of having multiple players.


Now there&#39;s where the LiaC game is at. Still in the very beta stages, getting the base engine down. Soon it&#39;ll be over and the game will have started to be worked on.

<p>Anyway, on LiaC development…</p>
<p>I’ve technically added items. I’ve done it both server-sided and client-sided, but I’ve rewritten the server completely. The main reason was due to instability and it wasn’t compatible of handling multiple players at once, for some reason. My code was also confusing.</p>
<p>But yea. Hopefully I’ll have items done today, which includes “using” them when I get those specific packets properly sent.</p>

<p>And no thanks, it’s too late to start over. If I really wanted graphics, I’d have used WinSock and Visual Basic 6, where I can develop a game with graphics… That or Game Maker…</p>

              <p>Yea, which is why I made this topic… I’ve noticed that normal text-based RPGs are normally offline, don’t have much action, and are pretty boring. For example, if you were to battle, there’d be no timers and it’d be a plain “Attack”. I wanna have spells, events, attack types, etc… With timers.</p>
<p>Anyway, my game took a huge step in development today. I think I might turn this thread into a development thread for my game… Oh well, who knows.</p>

<p>theres a game called darkthrone i think or dark* i cant remember its a pretty good text based RPG. Ideas will be few and far between because basically all text based RPGs are the same so its going to be harder to get uniqueness into the game</p>

Ive tried to make an RPG, using the game engine “RPGMAKER”, it was a good experiance but it failed.<br>
I wish you the best of luck, although i think you should go beyond the phase of Skills, Iteams and medevil times, as it is just too common is the aspects of RPG, try something new.</p>

              <p>Turned into a development topic for my game.</p>
<p>Well, I’ve been working on a game for a bit, and I’m proud with how it’s coming. The game is text-based, but has buttons and other common Windows controls you’d find in other programs (Such as text &amp; combo boxes). It’s being written in C# .NET using the .NET Framework 2.0 for compatibility. Here is where you can catch the news for it.</p>
<p>The LiaC server has been completely rewritten, though only the core was really changed. This included stability, speed (Now 3 threads total verses the previous 5), and code neatness.</p>
<p>The server also has a better multiplayer system, and is much easier for me (Before, I for some reason used 2 variables; one for the socket indexes and one for the players… Both were terrible and would have overwritten previous player connections.) This one, instead of continuing from the last filled player slot, searches for an open one and uses that.</p>
<p>The IO system is still the same; easy to write and read. I’ve also added an item database. Basically, it’s like the item configuration in the RuneScape cache, except mine’s not a binary file and is loaded from the server :). The item configuration only sets the price, the use options, if it has the ability to be equipped, the description, and the name. Other things like equipment stats will be loaded from a separate file.</p>
<p>It also has a packet timer, which when hits 3, logs the other user out. This goes for the client; when it hits 3, the client’s main window closes and goes to the login screen.</p>
<p>So now the client development. It’s coming along good. I’ve added the inventory little group, and the “Use Item” window. I’ve also added packet sending, and item requesting.</p>
<p>Right now, LiaC’s inventory system is being added. Testing with a friend showed me that it was my computer that only got the problem, where it worked fine for him. I guess that also means it’s fully functional of having multiple players.</p>
<p>Now there’s where the LiaC game is at. Still in the very beta stages, getting the base engine down. Soon it’ll be over and the game will have started to be worked on.</p>
