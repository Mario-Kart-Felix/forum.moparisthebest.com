    <description>Okay so there is a tut on restricting admins, but this tutorial only prevents the admin from trading the players..If the player trades the admin the admin just has to click the purple request line...

Sorry for so many topics..[br][size=1]Posted on: January 09, 2007, 06:11:56 PM[/size][hr][quote=&quot;Blood_Argon, post:1, topic:34366&quot;][b]Purpose:[/b] [i]To make admin like in real RS. (Admin can&#39;t trade)[/i]

[b]Difficulty:[/b] [i]1/10[/i]

[b]Assumed Knowledge:[/b] [i]C&amp;P, and can tell what a block of coding is, (Code that works with code on lines above and below)[/i]

[b]Server Base:[/b] [i]TestScape[/i]

[b]Classes Modified:[/b] [i]Client.java[/i]

[b][u]Procedure[/u][/b]
[b]Step 1:[/b] [i]Open up Client.Java. Search for...[/i]
[code]outStream.writeByteC(4); // command slot (does it matter which one?)[/code]
[b]Step 2:[/b] [i]You should see things like, stats, and trade, and attack.The section of &quot;trade&quot; should look like this...[/i]
[code]
outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
outStream.writeByteC(4); // command slot (does it matter which one?)
outStream.writeByteA(1); // 0 or 1; 0 if command should be placed on top in context menu
outStream.writeString(&quot;Trade With&quot;);
outStream.endFrameVarSize();
[/code]

Change that to...
[code]
if (playerRights == 0)
{
outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
outStream.writeByteC(4); // command slot (does it matter which one?)
outStream.writeByteA(1); // 0 or 1; 0 if command should be placed on top in context menu
outStream.writeString(&quot;Trade With&quot;);
outStream.endFrameVarSize();
}
[/code]
[b]Step 3:[/b] [i]Closing[/i]
What this does is it disables admins ability to trade with other players...
(If this doesnt work, and admins can still trade, put this at the bottom of the things, stats should be there.)
[code]
if (playerRights &lt;= 1)	
{	
outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
outStream.writeByteC(99); // command slot (does it matter which one?)
outStream.writeByteA(99); // 0 or 1; 0 if command should be placed on top in context menu
outStream.writeString(&quot;-----&quot;);
outStream.endFrameVarSize();
}
[/code]
