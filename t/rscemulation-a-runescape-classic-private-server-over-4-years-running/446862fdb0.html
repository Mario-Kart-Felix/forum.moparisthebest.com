Pyru, addressing the “RSCDaemon source”, what is RSCD going to be again? Some information, I seem to have forgot.<br>

<p>Considering most devs who touched RSCD over the years were teenagers/amateurs. We have caused lots of issues.[/quote]they’re talking about Zilent’s RSCD</p>

Pking isn’t any fun on this server, no such thing as a 1v1. You attack someone at castle then before you know it, it’s 10v1. No wonder the player count is falling  :palm:<br>
[/quote] True… but mostly the point is that nearly every player is banned.[/quote]</p>
<p>two major points your missing pking is all about teams, if you want to DM which means death match, there is a death match arena go there stop complaining about getting teamed you can get a team also…</p>
<p>every player is banned for breaking the rules, that isn’t the admins fault you choose to bot, or rwt, or other things. They give you plenty of warning  and will unban your acc with a stat and item wipe if you want to play again.</p>
<p>So what the complaints are</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>can’t pk cause teams, but don’t go to dm arena</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>breaks rules gets banned and complains?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you guys realize luke was a horrible admin, he was overly abusive, you do realize we are dealing with pyru, someone who gives many chances and doesn’t ban for no reason.</p>

first of all xp rate is high enough to make several pkers, and since ppl having different type of characters with different kind of levels, it makes pking possible for different lvl than always that 99 1 99 hybrids or flats.</p>
<p>2nd thing is that u dont need to pk at castle, thats the only place such an things exist like having characters logged in there, feel free to pk elsewhere if u want to.</p>
<p>3rd thing about teams:</p>
<p>its always more fun with more people as every game. as some1 mentioned there that feel free to go DM arena if u cant handle dying to the big teams, u should understand that 1v1s are 95% luck, u cant decide ur next hit, only thing u can do is cast and eat properly and theres delays to do that so it takes away that skill factor completely. when its 5v5 or 10v10, theres alot of different things included, like catching, teamwork aka being organized etc which makes it more enjoyable than just watching ur next hit.</p>
<p>about ur “hard truth” of losing the players: well its known that RSCE has less players nowdays since every1 gettin banned and they wanna enforce their unwritten rules no matter what, no moral included those decisions.</p>

<p>I think he is complaining more on the multi loggers and that if you kill someone they will have another acc logged and right beside you to pj you…</p>
<p>The problem i see it is people don’t want to follow the rules and get banned, right now we have no mods that abuse or go mute crazy or ban crazy. Jost sush and daymon(new) do just fine, rampage i don’t see him doin much when he on but edge sittin showin off his phat.</p>
<p>So basically evo, jag, and money are gone, we have a solid staff team now that don’t mute and ban for no reason.</p>

<p>seems like you have made a u-turn about rsce? Following quote is one of ur previous posts.</p>
<p>"lol all of you are idiots, im sure if pyru wasn’t such a kiss ass he would openly tell you also that luke did this numerous of times…</p>
<p>I can give you personal stories, Luke would tell me he was spawning sub cards, selling them for usd, buying them back for spawned gp and selling them back so there was not a lot circulating, also he created many stakers for people setting stats, selling 99 stats numerous times… told me if i wanted hed sell me 99 flats for 100 usd. this was within the first 3 months of the server…</p>
<p>All of you luke dick suckers are annoying, he was a shitty person, he thought of no1 but himself and his money, how to make more money and how to make him self look like a great guy in the process. He tried to do so much shit behind everyones back. He banned sara for corruption and demoted her etc, for the same shit he did every fudgein day… People are so fudgein dumb and naive. Pyru sells phats, and if your on his good side, you get them cheap and any color you want. even if the site says they are out of them… Mod crack has been caught selling mills by a few people and it gets swept under the rug… ex mod money unbanned mikko and got away with it, and of course it would have been seen on the mod logs but mikko came forward, or he would have got away with it…</p>
<p>I scammed vezl over 2B and pyru didn’t say shit, because he knew vezl was a piece of shit, vezl posted all over the forums that day for hours and i was sitting with over 20 hats + 5 canes, and 25 + dmed sq sets… and every other rare there was 2x of them. I know i stole 1m airs fires, and 50k deaths and 25k bloods…</p>
<p>Pyru claimed he didn’t know… lol i didn’t proxy… i checked stork-pk replicas db, saw snus password, tried it on rsce, logged on about 10 accounts and boom… Also there was no evidence of vezl botting etc.</p>
<p>He had over 5m+ total airs fires, and over 150k + deaths bloods… had over 2k rune sets, If i would of screenied the bank you would of thought he had bought lukes bike for him."</p>

<p>I’m not sure why you would revive an old post, which would only promote flame and spam, even after a moderator just posted a warning. If you wanted a definitive answer, why wouldn’t you just PM Dustin that personally? Maybe he’d have a direct answer on why he’s changed his opinion on the server.</p>

        <p>Bug Fixes/Changes as of December 14th, 2013</p>
<ul>
<li>Wielding an x-bow and clicking attack on another player in the wilderness, will no longer follow the affected player making it easier to “catch” them.</li>
<li>Oziach now properly sells male and female plate tops, and you should no longer get “stuck” when attempting to purchase one of the plate mail tops.</li>
<li>Trading and duelling have been re-written using a queue/caching system.</li>
<li>The “Skull” bug should now be fixed. “Skulling” should be replicated as to how it was in RuneScape Classic.</li>
<li>When attacked by another player, you should now see the text “You are under attack”.</li>
<li>When in the wilderness and attempting to bury bones or do an action that causes your character to become “busy”, should no longer stop an opponent from attacking you.</li>
<li>God spells have received a minor nerf. Any damage over 10, will have a chance to do 25% less damage than it previously did.</li>
<li>All weaken spells have received a nerf. Weakens from 5% to 3%, Confused 5% to 3%, Curse 5% to 3%, Vulnerability 10% to 6%, Enfeeble 10% to 6%, and stun 10% to 6%.</li>
</ul>
