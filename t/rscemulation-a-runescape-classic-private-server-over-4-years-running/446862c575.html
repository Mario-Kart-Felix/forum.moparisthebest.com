i think im scared now![/quote]</p>
<p>It’s not suppose to be intimidating. Just stating fact. The people who say it’s luck and are uneducated about the system are the ones who didn’t make it out in the wild. If it was luck you wouldn’t see people consistently win duels or make money. It’s all in the build, if you can catch, how well you are at casting, eating, prayer management etc etc. I was in the wild on a low level account I had and me and this guy both went at it with a full set of lobbys and we probably went 9 rounds. I lost because I took the defensive approach with 20 def while he was a monk pure. Was it luck? No. He built his character that way so that he could take on anybody his level.</p>
<p>Another scenario I would like to mention and this is my favorite one… back in the day when we use to low level pk (level 24 is where it was at) I remember people having 30 or 40 def and they would mage the hell out of you. As a fighter you couldn’t do anything against them because they were built that way. Most players had black 2h or axes and well… someone decided to just go pure str level 24 wielding a bronze 2h. They could max hit 8 or 9 while everyone else was at 7s. It created a huge advantage, especially with the low hp levels everyone had it was a constant 3 hit. Was that luck? no.</p>
<p>The only luck factor is the “hit” as in are you going to hit or not. Once again there are measurements a player can take in order to bring down that luck factor. Such as having the best weapon possible. A lot of people would spend 3200gp on a addy long rather than spending the 6400 on a addy2h. Which brings up money management but that’s what kept the economy going.</p>
<p>I am sure you’re just another player whos memory of rsc has been changed based on private servers. Private server combat systems are no where near the real game and won’t ever be replicated. So I suggest you login to rsc and actually see how it works before claiming it’s all just “luck”.</p>
<p>Once again, nacional is right.</p>

<p>i think im scared now!<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s not suppose to be intimidating. Just stating fact. The people who say it’s luck and are uneducated about the system are the ones who didn’t make it out in the wild. If it was luck you wouldn’t see people consistently win duels or make money. It’s all in the build, if you can catch, how well you are at casting, eating, prayer management etc etc. I was in the wild on a low level account I had and me and this guy both went at it with a full set of lobbys and we probably went 9 rounds. I lost because I took the defensive approach with 20 def while he was a monk pure. Was it luck? No. He built his character that way so that he could take on anybody his level.</p>
<p>Another scenario I would like to mention and this is my favorite one… back in the day when we use to low level pk (level 24 is where it was at) I remember people having 30 or 40 def and they would mage the hell out of you. As a fighter you couldn’t do anything against them because they were built that way. Most players had black 2h or axes and well… someone decided to just go pure str level 24 wielding a bronze 2h. They could max hit 8 or 9 while everyone else was at 7s. It created a huge advantage, especially with the low hp levels everyone had it was a constant 3 hit. Was that luck? no.</p>
<p>The only luck factor is the “hit” as in are you going to hit or not. Once again there are measurements a player can take in order to bring down that luck factor. Such as having the best weapon possible. A lot of people would spend 3200gp on a addy long rather than spending the 6400 on a addy2h. Which brings up money management but that’s what kept the economy going.</p>
<p>I am sure you’re just another player whos memory of rsc has been changed based on private servers. Private server combat systems are no where near the real game and won’t ever be replicated. So I suggest you login to rsc and actually see how it works before claiming it’s all just “luck”.</p>
<p>Once again, nacional is right.[/quote]<br>
since u havent noticed it yet, this thread is about RSCE not RSC.</p>
<p>every1 knows that theres catching, casting, eating etc but oh man, can u seriously call that as challenging nowdays after 10 years of on/off playing? the whole point was about some1 demanding 1v1s and i just said its boring and based on luck, as it is.</p>
<p>technically theres no such an thing called luck even if u played a lotto, u chosed the numbers. but in RSC/PRSC’s u cant even choose the numbers, its randomly chosen and nothing u can do about it. u can affect on it in a certain but it doesnt remove the luck factor completely which is why im calling it luck based. 1v1 is most luck based and more ppl u get, less luck based it gets. i dont like 1v1s just because its possible to lose since u cant affect 100% on it.</p>
<p>and especially this is the biggest bullshit who no1 seems to understand:</p>
<p>" If it was luck you wouldn’t see people consistently win duels or make money."</p>
<p>-its all about math, not luck. u can technically win 3/10 duels but still make a good amount of money off it. ok u can win more and technically increase the % of making money but once again, it doesnt matter since u aint gonna be unbeatable.</p>

<p>again… read above. those people who made those annoying accounts made it so it would be pure “luck” if you hit, or even killed them (as a fighter, not another mage or ranger).[/quote]</p>
<p>If you’re going to quote me include the full quote and not nit pick what you feel is necessary. You’re selective reading based on what you want to hear. It’s not luck because it’s impossible to do any sort or noticeable melee damage on them. Because of their build, they made fighters useless. No matter what stats you had at that point they were superior. I didn’t really elaborate on what I was meaning when I said “hit”. It’s the possibility of hitting. We all know the max hit but how do we calculate what damage should be done based on stats, nobody knows.</p>
<p>Yes Pegi this thread is about RSCE but who cares because it’s just another bump to the top of the advertisement page. I can point out a lot of posts that dont belong here, so what. Last time I checked RSCE is suppose to be an emulation of RSC so why do we have to discuss one and not the other?</p>
<p>If somebody is worse or better than you then you will notice it immediately in real rsc. If you have a better build and know what you’re doing you will win more matches. I would also like to bring up something that I haven’t mentioned yet and most players don’t really keep track of is the 4th hit. If you’re evenly matched and have similar stats and bail after the 3rd hit while your opponent continually lets the fight go on and takes that 4th hit, odds are in your favor.</p>

<p>nit pick? selective reading? i’m using your own words against you, because you clearly don’t understand what you’re saying.</p>
<p>if you’re referring to those low combat, defense based accounts, yes. they are built so that it is unlikely to hit them. thank you for being redundant. my point still stands that, they were made so it’s “luck” that you hit or kill them, because (in your own words) “the only luck factor is “hit””.</p>
<p>“knowing what you’re doing” doesn’t apply in Classic. I use to stake back in like 2006? 7? i don’t remember, anyways i only switched modes at combat 67. that’s it, just modes. and i would win more than i would lose against half of the players i staked. different staking styles worked for different stats. if it were just switching modes, to only toggling prayers, to using a diamond amulet &amp; gnome defense amulet. however, it didn’t work for some opponents. hell, sometimes there was absolutely nothing you could do about losing, no matter what you did you were going to lose.</p>
<p>we get it, the combat system was, and still is weird. no one here can explain it, so people say it’s “luck” because of that reason.</p>
<p>also before i wrap this up and move on to doing something better, i just want to say that I think you’re an idiot for that last line.</p>

        <p>Once again you’re nit picking my words. You take something selective and try to use it against someone because you’re incapable of providing any real thoughts or opinions on the subject. The quote you provided a few posts ago and you bolded it is a clear fact that you’re nit picking. Maybe you should of included the rest of it…</p>
<blockquote>The only luck factor is the "hit" as in are you going to hit or not. Once again there are measurements a player can take in order to bring down that luck factor.</blockquote>
<p>I guess I should of quoted “luck” because I wasn’t meaning luck but more of an “x” factor. I guess I will apologize for you’re inability to see past that statement, once again this falls back to nit picking.</p>
<p>Congratulations, you staked back in 2006/07 when rsc was dead and you clearly provided some valuable input about the combat system when you can’t even remember the year. I am not going to take your feedback regarding the subject because that was several years ago and it’s just a memory. I suggested to Pegi that he log into RSC sometime and revive his memory and I will suggest the same to you.</p>

seems u still havent understood the point. in 1v1 u can lose to any1, in 20v20(if u have a “better” pkers in ur side) u cant. thats the whole point and u can end the argument here. of course theres differences between the pking skills but as iv said it above and my previous posts, in a 1v1 u cant really do much since pking isnt rocket science. ofc the “luck” factor getting lower if u fight against the completely noob but in these days, after +10 years of playing, who cant seriously “toggle prayers”, cast, eat or catch. after all of that, based on avg skill lvl by pkers, it will reach that lvl of a skill that u cant really get any better(as it has happened to me) so when pker like me fights against other who has same amount of skill or even less in 1v1, either of us can win the battle and thats what i call a “luck” there.</p>
<p>if i was “best pker” i still can get beat, thats something which doesnt happen if theres no luck included, best would win all the time and that proves the theory of pking is luck based. its based on luck but u can reduce the amount of “luck” by being good but if ur opponent is good as u, its all about the luck.</p>
<p>and thats a bottom line cause i said so.</p>
