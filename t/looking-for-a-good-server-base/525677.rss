    <title>Looking for a good server base</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-good-server-base/525677</link>
    <description>Hello, I am a beginner when it comes to the rsps scene.  I have worked with them here and there but have never &#39;completed&#39; a server.  However, that is my current goal; I would like to &#39;complete&#39; a rsps to the best of my ability.  My main question to you is where should I begin?  One thing I have considered is beginning with Project Insanity.  If I were to use PI would I be limited?  What I mean by that is would there be any restrictions on what I could implement and would I be able to build a presentable server using PI as the base?

The main reason that I have these concerns is that I don&#39;t want to start coding a server and spend 100&#39;s of hours on it only to be dissatisfied with the results.

To sum it up:
I am looking for a mostly stable server download with which to begin what will become my dream server.  I&#39;m looking for one without anti-leech (not because I want to leech but because I&#39;m such a noob I would never figure it out) and one without many MAJOR bugs just because I would have lots of trouble figuring that out as I am a beginner.

Please reply with suggestions/advice/comments/whatever you like. THANKS!  :)

Edit: I did some more research and the general consensus is that PI is shit. What should I look into instead?</description>

It’s not hard to learn at all, all you need to do is just Google search some tutorials and such. Arham even provided an instructional video - I recommend you watch it.</p>

See, IDE’s are designed to make your programming experience far more smoother and comfortable. It will give you what your error is and sometimes an option to attempt a fix. It will show you warnings with resolutions to them. It will automatically compile your source upon saving. They’re great programs to use, and everyone that programs should use it. At least something like it. I, myself, use Netbeans.</p>

Use anything you feel comfortable with.  Any source can be turned into something decent if enough work is put into it.</p>
<p>Yes, many on here consider PI shit as we’ve made it shit through each new release.  The thing is that if you take a blank PI and add some better content in it and fix it up a bit, it’s pretty damn well.</p>
<p>However, if you feel better using Hyperion, Runesource, Delta, etc, then use them.  The important part is learning.<br>

<p>Well, unless you put weeks into it, you mean any source except Hybrid PVP can be turned into something decent.[/quote]<br>
I’ve seen one or two decent hybrid pvps, it just needs revamping in a lot of areas.</p>

<p>Well, unless you put weeks into it, you mean any source except Hybrid PVP can be turned into something decent.</p>

              <p>Hello, I am a beginner when it comes to the rsps scene.  I have worked with them here and there but have never ‘completed’ a server.  However, that is my current goal; I would like to ‘complete’ a rsps to the best of my ability.  My main question to you is where should I begin?  One thing I have considered is beginning with Project Insanity.  If I were to use PI would I be limited?  What I mean by that is would there be any restrictions on what I could implement and would I be able to build a presentable server using PI as the base?</p>
<p>The main reason that I have these concerns is that I don’t want to start coding a server and spend 100’s of hours on it only to be dissatisfied with the results.</p>
<p>To sum it up:<br>
I am looking for a mostly stable server download with which to begin what will become my dream server.  I’m looking for one without anti-leech (not because I want to leech but because I’m such a noob I would never figure it out) and one without many MAJOR bugs just because I would have lots of trouble figuring that out as I am a beginner.</p>
<p>Please reply with suggestions/advice/comments/whatever you like. THANKS!  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Edit: I did some more research and the general consensus is that PI is shit. What should I look into instead?</p>
