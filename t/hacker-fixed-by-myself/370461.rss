    <title>Hacker. Fixed by myself</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hacker-fixed-by-myself/370461</link>
    <description>[s]I have a wonderful hacker. Server base is PI, he loves to log in with no log or anything and just ban people. I thought it was one of my mods doing something stupid that was going to get them demoted, but nope...
I didn&#39;t realize until he banned me..

Is this seriously a hacker or a glitch that randomly bans people after a certain amount of time being online or whatever???

Please help me I don&#39;t know what to do and I might just shut down the server...[/s]

Hackers were IP banned and fixed the problem.</description>
