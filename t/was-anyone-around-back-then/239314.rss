    <description>When phreaking, carding, and hacking were huge?

I was just going through my old computer today, and found some guides to phreaking. I realized at the bottom of the guides, it listed who made it, and when it was made. Most were 1990-, some within the 1990s. I personally only started this stuff in the late 90s, but was anyone really into in back in the 80s?

Just looking for the originals I guess. Yeah.</description>
