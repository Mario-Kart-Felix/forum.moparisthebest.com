    <title>My opinion is that</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-opinion-is-that/7495</link>
    <description>the admins here are a bunch of anally retentive twats. &quot;Oh noes a bit of banter was flamed and the little children might cry and tell their mummys&quot;. Jeeze oh, give it up. Free speech dosent exist on forums, I know that. Did i post anything too vulgar? Nope I did not, you guys take it over the line with the moderation which qualifies moparisthebest for the gayest rs forum ever. Which is saying something as you beat even sythe.org and runecms! Holy hell! 

And to end my non coherent thread I will say this: Those within the administration team with a stick (or dick if the case may be) up their ass - YOU SUCK. 

This will probably deleted by some admin with nothing better to do, but c&#39;est la vie.</description>

Free speech, which I aggree should be aloud to an extent( Posting that picture is a little past my lines but Im not an admin ) ,</p>
<p>I do beleive people should be able to have there own opinions, but this does not mean they must harass the forum members with vulgar images or beleives to prove so. Racism, is the only thing I find unacceptable to post. I wish every racist bastard on here grew up as a jew during the holocast, and see what kind of shit you bring to the world. ( <span class="bbcode-b">Not saying im Jewish, Im actually caucasian</span> )</p>
<p>Spam, Pointless nonsence that clusters up the forum making it more difficult for the mature users to find there way around and relax while trying to find a thread worth reading.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>So you are aware, “Jewish” is a religion, not a race.  And yeah, it’s great you’re offended by the racism.  And yeah, racism as a whole is not funny.  But the ideas for pictures that people get are hilarious.  You can’t say you’ve never laughed at a racist joke.  It’s basically the same thing as a “dirty” joke, just with a different subject.  Like that lollercaust picture.  It kills me everytime I see it.  I can’t help it, it’s just hilarious.  No, I don’t think the hollocaust was funny.  No, I don’t think Hitler was a great man.  No, I don’t think the KKK is just a group of nice people cleaning up the streets.  But I find jokes about all of it humorous.  I’m not so uptight and insecure that I just couldn’t possibly find something like that funny.[/quote]<br>
Racism is not acceptable, and I do not find it something that should just be thought of as a joke. Yes, I have laughed at Racist jokes before,  but You do not see me on here posting pictures of the KKK hanging blacks, or posting images of the holocost in ASCII form, or images of the KKK kicking someones head into the curb. Wether or not those are real images it is not something I find humorous, there is a difference between telling a harmless joke then parading around spreading hatefull images of injustice and real life events.</p>
<p>Would you get a laugh if I posted the video of a american soldier that was decapitated with a machete while he was still alive? Would that give you guys kicks. It is not something that we should be flaunting around like some huge joke.</p>

<p>I do beleive people should be able to have there own opinions, but this does not mean they must harass the forum members with vulgar images or beleives to prove so. Racism, is the only thing I find unacceptable to post. I wish every racist bastard on here grew up as a jew during the holocast, and see what kind of shit you bring to the world. ( <span class="bbcode-b">Not saying im Jewish, Im actually caucasian</span> )</p>
<p>Spam, Pointless nonsence that clusters up the forum making it more difficult for the mature users to find there way around and relax while trying to find a thread worth reading.[/quote]</p>
<p>So you are aware, “Jewish” is a religion, not a race.  And yeah, it’s great you’re offended by the racism.  And yeah, racism as a whole is not funny.  But the ideas for pictures that people get are hilarious.  You can’t say you’ve never laughed at a racist joke.  It’s basically the same thing as a “dirty” joke, just with a different subject.  Like that lollercaust picture.  It kills me everytime I see it.  I can’t help it, it’s just hilarious.  No, I don’t think the hollocaust was funny.  No, I don’t think Hitler was a great man.  No, I don’t think the KKK is just a group of nice people cleaning up the streets.  But I find jokes about all of it humorous.  I’m not so uptight and insecure that I just couldn’t possibly find something like that funny.</p>

If the “freedom of speech act” actually allowed people to say whatever they pleased without consequence, not only would it be more promenent in cities but it would also give us “Normal” people(People with morals and ethics) a bad name because you metally ill bastards need to see a counselor. Which would overall cause more bullshit and problems in this world until it broke down into a anarchy.</p>
