    <description>I was trying to play on a server today and when I tried to log in it said &quot;Error Connecting to Server&quot;. So I tired another one....It did the same thing. I am using the Combattscape client and I try to log in and says the same thing. Then I try one of ryry871&#39;s clients and it worked fine. Can someone please help me? I don&#39;t know what is going on here.

I think it might have to do something with my java.</description>
