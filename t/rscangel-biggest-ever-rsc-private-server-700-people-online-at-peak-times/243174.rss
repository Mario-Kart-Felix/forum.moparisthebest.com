RSCA has been around for over a year!

We are the longest running server. This is the least corrupt private server you will ever find. 

The mods and admins are all mature adults and any abuse is dealt with swiftly. We&#39;re also the most populated and one of the most known RSC private servers.

RSCA was the first ever (rscd) server to have chest + stall thieving, pickpocketing and picklocking. We take a very hard stance on autoers and have banned over 3,000 autoers and abusers to date. 

We update the server however updates tend to take more time than other servers, this is for three reasons. First we take a lot of time to test updates prior to adding them to make sure all or at least most of the bugs are caught and fixed, secondly a lot of our resources go into supporting players and thirdly we have real lives :&gt;

For anyone who had tried us and quit because of the login server problems, I spent a while fixing them a couple of weeks back and since then it has pretty much been perfect apart from the couple of times we were DDoSed, then it was a bit harder to login.

We&#39;ve got some nice updates to come, including quests and a brand new combat system which mirrors RSC&#39;s very closely.

xEnt:

Ever wanted to play the good old f2p days again? I will be replicating the F2P version of RuneScape Classic as far as i can, right now almost all of the content is added except all quests (which will get added over time).

Server rates:

2x Normal
3x Subscriber

You may find more details on RSCAngel forums in the F2P part of the forums.

Report any bugs, they WILL get fixed fast, report any missing content that was there in F2P RSC. All P2P Features have been removed completely.

If you ever wanted to play RSCAngel but thought it was too late to become the best, now is your chance.
