    <title>[PI] Few Problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-few-problems/454781</link>
    <description>One of my problems is that my Turmoil won&#39;t drain. I&#39;ve check every file that I know of that would hold anything that has to do with prayer and turmoil. If anyone can help me out I&#39;d appreciate it.

Another problem of mine is my mining xp is very slow. I&#39;ve changed it in the files to make it worth more xp per ore but again nothing changed. Any ideas?

Thanks.</description>
