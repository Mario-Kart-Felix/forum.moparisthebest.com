              <p>You need to set your environmental variables because it’s not finding the command “java” or “javac” on it’s own.  The Soul made a tutorial regarding this, and if you’d look around a bit more, you wouldn’t have had to post this…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Setting up your Environmental Variables


Environmental variables are what allows you to run your server with Java, without it you would simple get 'The path is not yet specified' so this is an extremely important step. We will firstly open 'My Computer' and click 'View System Information'. As you do this, a small applet displaying several tabs, and you will select the one that says 'Advanced' and at the bottom, click 'Environmental Variables'. Now what you're going to do, is go to your 'Path' and 'Classpath' variables and edit them.

In your Classpath variable, you're going to take everything currently inside it and edit it with your latest version of JDK, so right now it would be;

Code: [Select]
CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_11\bin;%CLASSPATH%;

Though if a newer version comes out, you would change the 'jdk1.6.0_11' to the newest version.


After you have done the Classpath variable, you're going to find the Path variable and add the code below inside it.

Code: [Select]
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_11\bin;

The same goes for Path, if you download a newer version of JDK then you're going to change the 'jdk1.6.0_11' to your current version.</code></pre>
