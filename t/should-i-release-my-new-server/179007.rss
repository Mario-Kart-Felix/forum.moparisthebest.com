    <title>Should I release my new server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/should-i-release-my-new-server/179007</link>
    <description>I am running a PkIsle source of my server. Its name is DragonGuild. You may have known the user on these forums, his name is also DragonGuild but he is trying to ruin my server for years. I finally ip banned him off of my commputer and server. I was wondering maybe its time to quit. I know you will all leech because its the famous legendary PkIsle V1 source but maybe it had to be that way. Vote now so I can decide. Be honest and dont say yes because its pkisle. Please post if you vote. Thanks.</description>

              <p>I don’t think you should. No-one will appreciate it, they’ll just change the name maybe move a few npcs around and release it as a new source. That’s what happens here.</p>
