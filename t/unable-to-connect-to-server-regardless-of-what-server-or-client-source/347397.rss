    <title>Unable to connect to server regardless of what server or client source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unable-to-connect-to-server-regardless-of-what-server-or-client-source/347397</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve discovered a problem when I was trying to load up a server and a client on my local computer.
Regardless of what client, server or any combination of them both I used the client would close as soon as I connected.

There console reports the login and disconnect without any errors at all.
I&#39;m lost to what could be causing the problem.</description>

On other clients, the client just close.</p>
