    <title>Weird glitch on dodian?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/weird-glitch-on-dodian/177503</link>
    <description>Why is the damage counters way off in dodian? For example with veng, a 0 gets shown on you, but you get subtracted 20 health. Also with ring of recoils im trying to make. They always do 0s, but they subtract 1-2 health from the player each time. Same thing with special attacks. You hit a 1 1 but it does like 50 damage to them?
Tried looking in player.java maybe it had something to do with protected void appendHitUpdate(stream str)?</description>
