    <description>What do you think of the swamp water/grass and mycellium? Do you think it looks ugly, do you think he should make the textures blend together more? Personally I don&#39;t MIND it but I would really like it if he were to smooth it together.</description>

<p>I agree, it needs some sort of blending. And swamp water generation needs to be redone, an entire body of water should be swamp, not cut in half or whatever.</p>
