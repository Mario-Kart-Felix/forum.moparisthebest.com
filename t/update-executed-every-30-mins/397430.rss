    <title>Update executed every 30 mins?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/update-executed-every-30-mins/397430</link>
    <description>Lately all my players disconnect often. So I studied the the console and all the accounts get saved then kicked. Pretty much exactly what the ::update command does when it hits 0.
I believe its being run every 30 minutes. What can I do about this?</description>
