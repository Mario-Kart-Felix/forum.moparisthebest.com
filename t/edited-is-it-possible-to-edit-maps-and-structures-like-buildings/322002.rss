    <title>EDITED: Is it possible to edit maps and structures like buildings?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/edited-is-it-possible-to-edit-maps-and-structures-like-buildings/322002</link>
    <description>EDIT:

Alright, i got the last problem solved. Now, is there a way to edit maps and buildings/walls and stuff?

Cause all of my models are just weapons/armors/off hands stuff like that.

Can you tell me how to edit maps and such?</description>

i went ahead and found a relatively nice city. and i’m going to rip it down through objects and just rebuild a completely new city.</p>
<p>also, does anyone know how to get everything off the client?<br>
such as, the XP stuff (attack xp, magic xp, construction xp) off of the client. I deleted the icons but you can still click it and everything like that. I want to remove it all so it just looks completely blank. any help?</p>

<p>Alright, i got the last problem solved. Now, is there a way to edit maps and buildings/walls and stuff?</p>
