    <title>Problem with Combat</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-combat/166406</link>
    <description>Hi guys, I&#39;m having a problem with player vs NPC combat. It seems that my source, is edited from a source which was edited from a source. By the time all this had happened private servers had slowly mutilated by making combat training against objects and adding such things as spawning (eek!). But anyway, my problem is, I&#39;ve added a leprechaun to my server and when I fight it, it owns me. This leprechaun is level 9, and my character is 126 with a whip and it&#39;s getting owned. Can anyone help me fix this?

Many thanks, 

Syrillia.</description>

<p><em>edit</em> OK, I did it, and it all works fine. I didn’t actually know having ‘0’ as HP made the super strong. You learn something new everyday.</p>
