    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/loader-files-and-runescape-js5-file-im-not-sure-but-i-think-its-the-new-deob/4075</link>
    <description>Im not sure where to post this so im posting it here:
I decompiled the loader files only to find a very intersting ladder of links
loader-1448374125.cab
unpackclass.jar
finally leading to this file

Runescape.js5

its about the size of a deob although im not sure,
its 195kb

Does anyone know what this is? i cant open it i think its in a linux file format

Ive attached all files.</description>

              <p>They are one of jagex’s own filetypes (the type you see in the cache) Basically a collection of files appended to each other with 9 byte headers. I have extracted 3 files from it and attached.</p>
<p>Dont have a clue what they do, but the second one is interesting…, The large one looks similar to the files I see in the cachefile all the time, in cache index 10.</p>
<p>The ladder also leads to runescape.pack200 which is just a pack200.GZ file with the first 2 bytes removed (check my sig)</p>

              <p>hmm, looks intresting. maybe jagex has made some new file format that they use for loading rs code? i looked google and it didnt give anything about js5 code :o… so maybe they have theyr own programmed program witch converts java code to js5 file format… well actually i have no idea if thats even possible.</p>
