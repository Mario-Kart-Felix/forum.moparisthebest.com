    <title>Building a good eco/pvp server.. How?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/building-a-good-eco-pvp-server-how/507445</link>
    <description>This has always been an issue with me. I want to make a server that&#39;s good on the economy side.. And good on the pvp side too. I&#39;m no genius when it comes to putting them together. Cause you need to make it easy to access pvp gear, and easy to skill, but not to easy to obtain some of the best items.
How do you guys put them hand in hand?</description>

              <p>This depends on what route you are willing to approach.<br>
You can have new players join in a tutorial island sort of environment and require them to make their first set of armour and then their first batch of bread or food before they can dwell into the actual PKing world.<br>
You can have your players simply log in with a practical PKing starter and have them level up by fighting other players and neighboring NPCs.<br>
You have have your players earn XP lamps while fighting, which they can either use to the skill of their choice, or have the XP lamps be assigned to certain skills.<br>
An idea I just thought up of with construction is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Players must cut their own logs and bring them to the mill to have them made into planks.</li>
<li>Players must mine several metals and smith them to make nails.</li>
<li>Players must use a log with a bar of metal to make a hammer.</li>
<li>Afterwards, players may begin to create their own PKing rings, where:<br>
~ Players can set points for their own rink.<br>
~ Players can make use of an NPC running the same concept as player-owned-shops, but they must use the points they earn from that player’s ring to get the items in that shop.</li>

<li>At your home town, there is a group of NPC’s that you can speak with.</li>
<li>Speaking with the first one will set your levels to that of a ‘pure.’ You will then be asked if you wish to teleport to the pure’s PKing zone. To stop hoarding and massacre, only other pure’s have access to this area.</li>
<li>Do the same for maxed pkers, hybrids, no food PKing, etc.<br>
Alternatively, you can implement code that will stop another player from getting points if the level difference between the two is too great.[/quote]<br>
The issue with adding that, is I want to have the economy/skilling side behind the server too. I want the levels to be something achieved, but not achieved too hard or too easily. I don’t want runescape’s xp rates, but I don’t want an instant pk server. Some kids will get bored of that.<br>
But again, the idea of ranked pk zones sounds great. I might do a split of ranked and un-ranked. Of course, you get more points in unranked, as you can fight virtually anyone there (with the limits of level difference +/- 40ish).</li>

              <p>[quote=“Flame_, post:2, topic:507445”]Make your players work for it, while still providing the motivation for them to continue doing so.<br>
Key factors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The player’s taste in PK’ing</li>
<li>Economy:PVP ratio</li>
<li>Access to spawning</li>
<li>What levels are important,<br>
play into a server like this.<br>
Motivation-wise, there should be some sort of achievement, be it an item, a yell title, a specialized PK’ing zone, that should be at some point accessible to all.<br>
This would bring me to my next point; donators/members. Members should not be able to have access to superior items in a PK’ing server, in my opinion. If they did, new players and old alike would lose motivation because of an ‘elite PKer’ roaming around the wilderness. Give them an increased percentage of PK points per kill, or maybe allow them to have a point-free member’s PK’ing zone.<br>
Recently, point shops have become popular, yet they only play their part in a short term span. Once players have access to these items, they find themselves losing the motivation to keep on earning them.<br>
You should definitely invest some time in periodic promotion events. These could be double-point weekends, PK’ing tournaments that reward, say, an ‘Elite Pker’ player title, or Bring-a-Friend events. With something to look forward to, players find themselves willing to stick around and see what fun event the administration might hold in store for them.[/quote]<br>
I will definitely look into your ideas of events and such, I really think it’d be helpful.<br>
I agree with you 100% on the donor/member item access. My server does indeed have a donation system, but I will never give out items that give an advantage as such to my donors. They get cosmetics, and maybe some items that increase xp or rewards and such. Nothing that can damage the overall economy.</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess my biggest issue here, is I’m not a pk’er, nor was I ever interested in it. So I don’t know what players like that want. I’ve been a main-maxer-character type of guy. One that wants to conquer everything possible, and earn all the rewards. Not kill others and loot. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>Make your players work for it, while still providing the motivation for them to continue doing so.<br>
Key factors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The player’s taste in PK’ing</li>
<li>Economy:PVP ratio</li>
<li>Access to spawning</li>
<li>What levels are important,<br>
play into a server like this.<br>
Motivation-wise, there should be some sort of achievement, be it an item, a yell title, a specialized PK’ing zone, that should be at some point accessible to all.<br>
This would bring me to my next point; donators/members. Members should not be able to have access to superior items in a PK’ing server, in my opinion. If they did, new players and old alike would lose motivation because of an ‘elite PKer’ roaming around the wilderness. Give them an increased percentage of PK points per kill, or maybe allow them to have a point-free member’s PK’ing zone.<br>
Recently, point shops have become popular, yet they only play their part in a short term span. Once players have access to these items, they find themselves losing the motivation to keep on earning them.<br>
You should definitely invest some time in periodic promotion events. These could be double-point weekends, PK’ing tournaments that reward, say, an ‘Elite Pker’ player title, or Bring-a-Friend events. With something to look forward to, players find themselves willing to stick around and see what fun event the administration might hold in store for them.</li>

              <p>This has always been an issue with me. I want to make a server that’s good on the economy side… And good on the pvp side too. I’m no genius when it comes to putting them together. Cause you need to make it easy to access pvp gear, and easy to skill, but not to easy to obtain some of the best items.<br>
How do you guys put them hand in hand?</p>
