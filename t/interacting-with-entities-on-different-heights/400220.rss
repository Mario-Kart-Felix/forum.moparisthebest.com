    <title>Interacting with Entities on Different Heights</title>

    <description>Can a player or npc interact with another player or npc on different height levels? What I mean by this is if you have player A at level 0, and npc B at level 1, could player A attack npc B or do they have to be at the same level? (An example of this would be castlewars, but I can&#39;t quite remember the result.)</description>

              <p>Scratch what I said, just write some thing saying like<br>
If (npcID == ####, heightLevel == #, npc != null) {<br>
Starting it out like that, then build on it to add the player so like &amp; playerHeight == or so and so</p>

              <p>Well, obviously anything is possible, but u would have to essentially make he server think that height 0 and height 1 are the same, or are combined. So yes u could, but it would screw up everything else.</p>
