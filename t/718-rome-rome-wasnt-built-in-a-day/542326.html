<p>Rome is a 667 loading 718 that is build on the idea to be different, but to the extent of maintaining real RuneScape aspects. [B]The main idea of the server is to have playability, interactivity, and tons of content.[/B] This server wants to keep aspects of the Roman Empire times but still maintaining RuneScape, making this a blend of medieval and emperor times. The logic of this server is to make YOU a ‘Roman’ not some ‘Player’. We found this a more formal way of talk and found this to be quite descriptive of YOU. Our interactivity will be to produce content that will come from the unexpected, and something that is fun and doesn’t always have to follow the pattern of “get on a server, get 99s, and PK!” We found this to be quite repetitive, and wished to annihilate that from our server. All-in-all, this server is circulated by YOU and not by the concept of “the world is just turning around.”</p>

<p>I am no longer interested in “making” an RSPS (I might work for one). $60 in ads, $17 a month for expenses, and the max players we reached were 11, with our average being 4. I spent all the money I had on this server. But it just concludes that the rich will always end up more superior than those who have less money to offer. Look at Ikov for example. 3 months and they get 1,500 players. Then you see those servers with the most dedicated teams sit there with 8 players (Arios for example).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">With the release of this work, my mission is complete for this project. Nothing should be kept hidden, away from everyone, because if you want the community to make betterness, then release betterness.</span></p>
<p>Thank you everyone,<br>
