<p>Rome is a 667 loading 718 that is build on the idea to be different, but to the extent of maintaining real RuneScape aspects. [B]The main idea of the server is to have playability, interactivity, and tons of content.[/B] This server wants to keep aspects of the Roman Empire times but still maintaining RuneScape, making this a blend of medieval and emperor times. The logic of this server is to make YOU a ‘Roman’ not some ‘Player’. We found this a more formal way of talk and found this to be quite descriptive of YOU. Our interactivity will be to produce content that will come from the unexpected, and something that is fun and doesn’t always have to follow the pattern of “get on a server, get 99s, and PK!” We, the Roman team, find this to be quite repetitive, and wish to annihilate that from our server. All-in-all, this server is circulated by YOU and not by the concept of “the World is just turning around”</p>
<p>[B][U]In 11 words: The collaboration of Rome while keeping the main idea of RuneScape.[/U][/B]</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Slpimbh.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>[B][COLOR=ORANGE]Server Thought Process[/COLOR][/B]<br>
The server is built to replace the name of “Player” to “Roman”. Staff are "Emperor"s. Donators? Get rid of that name. They are 'Lord’s (or 'Lady’s if they are a girl character). Everyone considers Taverley, our home, to be the main epicenter of Rome, as it has the Central Trading Hub, Skilling Tutors, the Town Crier (one of few), the Squire (one of two), and the Financial Adviser (one of few). It also provides nearly all things that a skiller may need for their journey in Rome. The thought for having it all-in-one, with a few cuts our (such as how rocktails and such are not at Taverley) is to maintain the socialization perspective of Rome.</p>
<p><img src="http://puu.sh/5Vkyn.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
[size=1]This is an example of our status system that will come very soon to Rome![/size]<br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/5VkP6.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
[size=1]This is an example of an Emperor (better known as staff) being named a Roman Emperor.[/size]<br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/5VlOK.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
[size=1]This is an example of the Roman idea put into dialogue. This type of dialogue is found all around Rome![/size]<br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/5Vvht.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
[size=1]This is an example of keeping the idea of Rome in almost every premises.[/size]</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Slpimbh.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>[B][COLOR=ORANGE]Playability &amp; Content[/COLOR][/B]<br>
The server is designed to have access to alot of your playable content all in one place, the Fairy Ring transportation system! Playable content include minigames, skills, and other specs that are needed, crucial or not, for your gameplay. I will be straight out honest here, the server has the content of Matrix. Why do I state this? Because I don’t want you all to think that I somehow proclaimed the Fight Caves or Pest Control to be mine and all mine.</p>
<p>A server idea we have for a minigame can be found below.</p>
<blockquote>[B][COLOR=BROWN]Roman Assault - A barbarian to Rome jungle.[/COLOR][/B]
<p>There is a ship at the start, a cutscene coming, showing Roman Guards getting off the ship. Afterwards, you get out. When you get out, you see a battle going on. Barbarians fighting Roman Guards. You must kill as many Barbarians as you can. Once they are all killed, a boss will come. His level will be the exact average of all the players in the game (So if we have a level 69, a level 52, and a level 47, the boss would be the calculated average of their levels (thus, the boss is level 56)). Once the boss is killed, all participants get a reward, just like Pest Control. The person with the most kills gets more money, and vice-versa.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Slpimbh.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>[B][COLOR=ORANGE]Interactivity[/COLOR][/B]<br>
Our prime concern is interactivity. The reason being that we believe that if the server is not interactive, then it doesn’t have the playable feel. Interactivity, to us, is the server having something going on, everywhere. I swear to you, when I was walking down from Taverley to Edgeville, I found things that I forgot I even programmed in pop out of nowhere. That’s interactivity to me. That’s true interactivity.</p>
<p>[B][COLOR=BROWN]We Care About the Little Things[/COLOR][/B]<br>
We believe that the little things count. If you were to walk down as an adventurer in Roman times, no food with you, and suddenly you got attacked and are hungry. What’s the first reaction you’d do? Get food! There is a cabbage field right near you. You run to eat the cabbage. But what do you find? You click it and the boring message, “Nothing interesting happens,” comes up. On Rome, we strive to count the little things in, meaning when you are in dire need, and have no food around, you can click on some sort of field and not worry about that terrifying message, “Nothing interesting happens.”</p>

<p>[B][COLOR=ORANGE]Freedom[/COLOR][/B]<br>
Unlike the real Roman Empire, freedom of choice is in this new Rome, with only little exceptions (such as the tool belt). You can be a skiller without having the fear of having, being forced to, kill something in order for you to do what you love. You can be a PvN person without having the requirement to kill a fellow Roman, but instead fight alongside them. You can be a PvP person without having a non-playable character getting in your way for your dream of PvP. You can choose, we don’t care!<br>

[SIZE=1]The toolbelt. At this era of RuneScape, all items that were not quest items were unlocked by default and also the player could not supply an item higher than bronze. This is one of the few things that have no freedom.[/SIZE]</p>

<p>[B][COLOR=ORANGE]The BvB Series[/COLOR][/B]<br>
Rome now features a way where our Emperors can come and take requests and be social with our players. This is the BvB Youtube series.</p>
<p>BvB stands for Boss vs. Boss. Romans suggest which Boss should fight any other Boss, and Emperors will take your request and try their best to make it a reality. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

I thank you for reading this thread and we, the Roman team, the three Emperors, would like to thank you. Please, if you show support, drop the support banner in your signature or take time to atleast post a reply for more to see.

        <p>Decided to make a MoparScape account  :rolleyes:<br>
Today I am working on a Recruitment Drive quest for presentation to Arham and Andrew</p>
<ul>
<li>Quest - Recruitment Drive allows the player to buy the roman battle suit</li>
<li>3 part Quest - Joining roman army, going through tutorial, and finally the final battle.</li>
<li>Roman battle suit = the Roman suit arham posted on the thread.<br>
*Will give access to buy the suit in pieces, 15k exp in melee skills, and rights to go to use halberds (can be decided on rewards later)</li>
</ul>
<p>If there are any suggestions to this quest please post below</p>
<p>All hail Rome!</p>
