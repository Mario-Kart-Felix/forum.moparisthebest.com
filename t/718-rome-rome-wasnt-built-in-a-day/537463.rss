Rome is a 667 loading 718 that is build on the idea to be different, but to the extent of maintaining real RuneScape aspects. [B]The main idea of the server is to have playability, interactivity, and tons of content.[/B] This server wants to keep aspects of the Roman Empire times but still maintaining RuneScape, making this a blend of medieval and emperor times. The logic of this server is to make YOU a &#39;Roman&#39; not some &#39;Player&#39;. We found this a more formal way of talk and found this to be quite descriptive of YOU. Our interactivity will be to produce content that will come from the unexpected, and something that is fun and doesn&#39;t always have to follow the pattern of &quot;get on a server, get 99s, and PK!&quot; We, the Roman team, find this to be quite repetitive, and wish to annihilate that from our server. All-in-all, this server is circulated by YOU and not by the concept of &quot;the World is just turning around&quot;

[B][U]In 11 words: The collaboration of Rome while keeping the main idea of RuneScape.[/U][/B]

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Slpimbh.png[/img]

[B][COLOR=ORANGE]Server Thought Process[/COLOR][/B]
The server is built to replace the name of &quot;Player&quot; to &quot;Roman&quot;. Staff are &quot;Emperor&quot;s. Donators? Get rid of that name. They are &#39;Lord&#39;s (or &#39;Lady&#39;s if they are a girl character). Everyone considers Taverley, our home, to be the main epicenter of Rome, as it has the Central Trading Hub, Skilling Tutors, the Town Crier (one of few), the Squire (one of two), and the Financial Adviser (one of few). It also provides nearly all things that a skiller may need for their journey in Rome. The thought for having it all-in-one, with a few cuts our (such as how rocktails and such are not at Taverley) is to maintain the socialization perspective of Rome.

[size=1]This is an example of our status system that will come very soon to Rome![/size]

[size=1]This is an example of an Emperor (better known as staff) being named a Roman Emperor.[/size]

[size=1]This is an example of the Roman idea put into dialogue. This type of dialogue is found all around Rome![/size]

[size=1]This is an example of keeping the idea of Rome in almost every premises.[/size]

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Slpimbh.png[/img]

[B][COLOR=ORANGE]Playability &amp; Content[/COLOR][/B]
The server is designed to have access to alot of your playable content all in one place, the Fairy Ring transportation system! Playable content include minigames, skills, and other specs that are needed, crucial or not, for your gameplay. I will be straight out honest here, the server has the content of Matrix. Why do I state this? Because I don&#39;t want you all to think that I somehow proclaimed the Fight Caves or Pest Control to be mine and all mine.

A server idea we have for a minigame can be found below.
&lt;blockquote&gt;[B][COLOR=BROWN]Roman Assault - A barbarian to Rome jungle.[/COLOR][/B]

There is a ship at the start, a cutscene coming, showing Roman Guards getting off the ship. Afterwards, you get out. When you get out, you see a battle going on. Barbarians fighting Roman Guards. You must kill as many Barbarians as you can. Once they are all killed, a boss will come. His level will be the exact average of all the players in the game (So if we have a level 69, a level 52, and a level 47, the boss would be the calculated average of their levels (thus, the boss is level 56)). Once the boss is killed, all participants get a reward, just like Pest Control. The person with the most kills gets more money, and vice-versa.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Slpimbh.png[/img]

[B][COLOR=ORANGE]Interactivity[/COLOR][/B]
Our prime concern is interactivity. The reason being that we believe that if the server is not interactive, then it doesn&#39;t have the playable feel. Interactivity, to us, is the server having something going on, everywhere. I swear to you, when I was walking down from Taverley to Edgeville, I found things that I forgot I even programmed in pop out of nowhere. That&#39;s interactivity to me. That&#39;s true interactivity.

[B][COLOR=BROWN]We Care About the Little Things[/COLOR][/B]
We believe that the little things count. If you were to walk down as an adventurer in Roman times, no food with you, and suddenly you got attacked and are hungry. What&#39;s the first reaction you&#39;d do? Get food! There is a cabbage field right near you. You run to eat the cabbage. But what do you find? You click it and the boring message, &quot;Nothing interesting happens,&quot; comes up. On Rome, we strive to count the little things in, meaning when you are in dire need, and have no food around, you can click on some sort of field and not worry about that terrifying message, &quot;Nothing interesting happens.&quot;

[img]http://puu.sh/5VmwP.png[/img]
[size=1]This is an example of the Town crier feature that allows you to get updates in almost all the major cities![/size]
http://youtu.be/NGiymfU5Tvs
[size=1]This is an example of a completely Roman idea where a Roman Guard will attack a Barbarian to the death at randomly selected locations.[/size]
[img]http://puu.sh/5wSFp.png[/img]
[size=1]This is an example of our &#39;before&#39; image when pickables didn&#39;t work. Isn&#39;t it boring seeing the &#39;Nothing interesting happens.&#39; text?[/size]
[img]http://puu.sh/690WZ.png[/img]
[size=1]This is the Latest Kills board where all the latest kills are recorded.[/size]
[img]http://puu.sh/5XqYf.png[/img]
[size=1]This is an example of our In-game login time awards.[/size]
[SIZE=1]A little secret. Shh! We have two more secret features that will come as a shocker to anyone who finds it out. Here&#39;s 2 hints:[/size]
[list]
[*][SIZE=1]Its when you say something aloud, not a command or anything, but ordinary talk.[/size]
[*][SIZE=1]They are from famous lyrics or videos.[/size]
[/list]

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Slpimbh.png[/img]

[B][COLOR=ORANGE]Freedom[/COLOR][/B]
Unlike the real Roman Empire, freedom of choice is in this new Rome, with only little exceptions (such as the tool belt). You can be a skiller without having the fear of having, being forced to, kill something in order for you to do what you love. You can be a PvN person without having the requirement to kill a fellow Roman, but instead fight alongside them. You can be a PvP person without having a non-playable character getting in your way for your dream of PvP. You can choose, we don&#39;t care!
http://youtu.be/BHHtMTKHp7E
[SIZE=1]The toolbelt. At this era of RuneScape, all items that were not quest items were unlocked by default and also the player could not supply an item higher than bronze. This is one of the few things that have no freedom.[/SIZE]

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Slpimbh.png[/img]

[B][COLOR=ORANGE]The BvB Series[/COLOR][/B]
Rome now features a way where our Emperors can come and take requests and be social with our players. This is the BvB Youtube series.

BvB stands for Boss vs. Boss. Romans suggest which Boss should fight any other Boss, and Emperors will take your request and try their best to make it a reality. ;)

              <p>We are getting alot ready for the release coming in 1 (or 2) day(s). We gotta do the following and I’ve been starting to get pretty lazy (been getting addicted to Rome Total War II):</p>
<p>[ul][li]Slayer shop[/li]<br>
[li]Voting rewards (if any)[/li]<br>
[li]Fixing any wrong information[/li]<br>
[li]Better shops (The shop sells to a max of adamant since I was initially making this server 25x lol)[/li][/ul]</p>

<p>Slayer tokens! They are a new addition to Rome now! I mentioned these before (not sure if here or on R-S), and now they are here. Here’s a little detail about 'em:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">--- Slayer Shop ---
Rev. a2
---
Tasks differ upon tutor. This is so nobody can cheat and use the 
lowest master to their advantage:
--
Format: * MASTER_NAME - REGULAR_AMOUNT - EVERY_10TH TASK - EVERY_50TH_TASK
* Tureal - 0 tokens - 0 tokens - 0 tokens
* Mazchna - 10 tokens - 50 tokens - 150 tokens
* Vannaka - 40 tokens - 200 tokens - 600 tokens
* Chaeldar - 100 tokens - 500 tokens - 1500 tokens
* Sumona - 120 tokens - 600 tokens - 1800 tokens
* Duradel - 150 tokens - 750 tokens - 2250 tokens
* Kuradal - 180 tokens - 900 tokens - 2700 tokens
---
Conversion to gold - Tokens x100.5 = Gold
Skip task - 300 Tokens
Ban task - 1000 Tokens
Slayer helmets set (Contains 10,000) - 4000 Tokens
Ring of slaying set (Contains 10,000) - 3000 Tokens
EXP Lamp - 450 Tokens</code></pre>
<p>Yeah… you don’t want to see rev. a1…</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">First thing you will notice is that Turael does not give you any tokens. This is to prevent cheating the system. </span></p>
<p>This is how they work; each master gives out a certain amount of tokens (cheatsheet found in the thing I posted above :p). Every tenth task you get a 5x bonus over the 9th, 8th, etc. task. For every 50th task, you get 3x as many tokens as the 10th, 20th, etc. task.</p>
<p>For example, Duradel gives Mr. Boogie 150 tokens per task, except on the 10th task in which he gives 750 tokens, and on the 50th task in which he gives 2250 tokens. Mr. Boogie here has completed 19 tasks (oh my, his friends will be so proud!). He goes to fight the Iron Dragons his master assigned. Mr. Boogie, the strong guy he is, completes the task and gets 750 tokens.<br>
[size=1]Mr. Boogie is off partying with his friends for completion of his 20th task, so we couldn’t get an interview.[/size]</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>So, I’ve been working on the Fairy Rings still. Wanna get this complete! What I’ve got so far:</p>
<p><img src="http://puu.sh/6jbaC.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/6jbdx.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/6jbeM.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/6jbfK.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Yes, with those spawns.<br>
…and yes, the little things do count.</p>
<p><img src="http://puu.sh/6jbn5.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Yeah, I know spawns aren’t considered updates, but everything has to be logged. Not like I am counting them as “major updates”.</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>UPDATE 1/13/2014:</p>
<p><img src="http://puu.sh/5W5VM.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Fairy Rings, 3rd day. Funny thing is, in fairy tales, the number 3 is the main theme. “Three” Little Pigs. “Three” Dares (in The Wise Old Woman). “Three” Beans (in Jack and the Beanstalk). And so on… (Fun fact: I said 3 examples.) And now, Fairy Tales and Fairy Ring, don’t they go perfectly together?</p>
<p>Today I added the spawns at the Sinclair Mansion. Ugh, these Fairy Rings are taking forever (mostly because I easily lose concentration), but only 4 more places left! When the Fairy Rings are done, it will be considered a ‘major update’, considering it is one of the only 2 main ways of transportation in Rome.</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>UPDATE 1/14/2014:</p>
<p>Was kinda in a sluggish mood today so I did nothing, but we do have sad news.</p>
<p>Emperor Rize has been removed from the team for inactivity. A sincere ‘good luck’ from me if he is going through anything. He is welcome to join at any time, with the promise of staying active.</p>

<p>So I’ve been working on that Fairy Ring system. My motto for this is to get the spawns around the area of the fairy ring, for more training areas and (since Kuradal’s Dungeon is included) to provide more money making ways. What I’ve got so far:</p>
<p><img src="http://puu.sh/6ivwh.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/6ivHj.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>I have also added the spawn of Kuradal’s Dungeon, Ancient Caverns, and McGrubor’s Woods.</p>
<p>And I couldn’t find the barrier animation, so I made them the wilderness ditch animation. :lolbert:</p>
<p><img src="http://puu.sh/6iw6M.gif" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Added some transportation to Kalphite Queen. Couldn’t find the object ID for the Kalphite Queen cave entrance, so I made an NPC called the Wanderer and made some dialogue with her.</p>
<p>For a fee of 3 gold coins, you can enter the cave. And, a little fun, she’ll call you a “fellow wanderer”, “adventurer”, or “passerby”. By default, its “fellow wanderer”. You can yell and her and she’ll call you something else. Example:<br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/6iE8q.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
…and her response:<br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/6iEas.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
Coming back to her:<br>
