[B]I am now finished with my masterpiece Rome. I give anyone permission to re-release this as long as I do get credits. You are free to use this for your server, and the credits are appreciated. This is 5 months of work, it&#39;s no joke or sarcasm. I started this on November 18th, and it ends today. I am thankful to all those who supported Rome and am thankful to every player who got online. [COLOR=red]Really.[/COLOR][/B][/CENTER]

Rome is a 667 loading 718 that is build on the idea to be different, but to the extent of maintaining real RuneScape aspects. [B]The main idea of the server is to have playability, interactivity, and tons of content.[/B] This server wants to keep aspects of the Roman Empire times but still maintaining RuneScape, making this a blend of medieval and emperor times. The logic of this server is to make YOU a &#39;Roman&#39; not some &#39;Player&#39;. We found this a more formal way of talk and found this to be quite descriptive of YOU. Our interactivity will be to produce content that will come from the unexpected, and something that is fun and doesn&#39;t always have to follow the pattern of &quot;get on a server, get 99s, and PK!&quot; We found this to be quite repetitive, and wished to annihilate that from our server. All-in-all, this server is circulated by YOU and not by the concept of &quot;the world is just turning around.&quot;

[COLOR=red][b]In 11 words: The collaboration of Rome while keeping the main idea of RuneScape.[/b][/COLOR]

[b]Youtube channel (for videos):
[url=http://youtube.com/TheRomanRSPS]TheRomanRSPS[/url][/b]

I am no longer interested in &quot;making&quot; an RSPS (I might work for one). $60 in ads, $17 a month for expenses, and the max players we reached were 11, with our average being 4. I spent all the money I had on this server. But it just concludes that the rich will always end up more superior than those who have less money to offer. Look at Ikov for example. 3 months and they get 1,500 players. Then you see those servers with the most dedicated teams sit there with 8 players (Arios for example).

[b]With the release of this work, my mission is complete for this project. Nothing should be kept hidden, away from everyone, because if you want the community to make betterness, then release betterness.[/b]

Thank you everyone,
Arham

              <p>Very nice release, although I don’t like the newer servers and cannot seem to find any OS servers anywhere so I’m sparing off of one that needs a lot of work. I don’t think I’m looking hard enough anyone have any information.

<blockquote>Exploit:Java/CVE-2013-2465 uses a vulnerability that was found in a 2D component of Java SE. The problem lies in the way the underlying memory operation checks for validity of raster data. Specifically, the memory corruption issue happens in AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) code. AWT dos native operations on the image data used in the Java application.
<p>The vulnerable classes are:</p>
<p>[ul][li]java.awt.image.MultiPixelPackedSampleModel[/li]<br>
[li]java.awt.image.SinglePixelPackedSampleModel[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Malicious raster data is prepared for the vulnerable classes. Memory copy operation happens when the image transformation class, for example java.awt.image.AffineTransformOp, is used upon these crafted image objects. The destination raster memory array will be overflown with hacker-supplied data. Heap corruption will happen at this point.</p>
<p>Unlike many previous Java vulnerabilities, the exploitation actually happens with native code, not in the code written in Java, and native level memory corruption is involved. The thing is that the Java internal memory structure is laid out very predictably and it helps with the stability of the exploits. Usual exploitation involves the corruption of the hacker-supplied array data structure. By corrupting the length field of the affected data structure, the malicious code will gain full control on the native level memory space. Searching through this memory space and changeing fields related to user privileges, hackers can achieve escalation of privilege.</p>
<p>Usually exploits are written using a few Java classes working together. The various class files are bundled into an archive called a JAR, which uses the ZIP file format. Every JAR contains a Manifest.MF file to identify itself to the Java Runtime. Since it is found in every JAR, it won’t be listed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most likely a detection by your virus protection looking for outdated code which references this code from earlier versions of Java which haven’t patched this exploit, nothing to worry about. Please do research about these issues before trying to shame a reputable member, t thanks.</p>
