    <title>PI 317 Source - Public chat doesn&#39;t work? HELP NEEDED!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-317-source-public-chat-doesnt-work-help-needed/543839</link>
    <description>Hi there,

I&#39;ve been using a Project Insanity source for my RSPS, and realised recently, once I sent a friend the .jar file, that the public chat doesn&#39;t seem to work! 

If I type a message, it appears above my head AND in the chat box for me, but my friend cannot see what I have written on his screen, or in his chat box!

Has anyone else had this problem with a PI 317? I&#39;ve tried a different client and that hasn&#39;t made a difference...

I&#39;m hoping I can edit/replace one of the .java files relating to public chat and it might work....?</description>

              <p>This seems pretty simple, but the first thing you should check is to see if your friend has public chat enabled (by using the little buttons below the chatbox). If this doesn’t work, let me know.</p>
