    <title>I need an idea for a flash movie</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-an-idea-for-a-flash-movie/1844</link>
    <description>What flash movie should I make for my final project of my animation class?

It&#39;s far from due, but I want to get a headstart so I can have the best one ;)

We have a choice: A 3d model, or a flash movie. I love both, but I have the advantage that I am pretty good with flash and flash actionscripting while the rest of the class hasn&#39;t even found out about flash yet. I want to make a flash movie that is like 10 minutes long, with decent graphics and animations. But I need some ideas. I have some good ideas, but they are runescape cheating/kaitnieks related, not sure if that&#39;s what I want for a final project worth 30% of our mark. I either want to make something corny and funny(like the movie &quot;There she is&quot;) or something completly random and funny, or a parody of something.

Any ideas of a good one? I am not looking for storyline, just an idea. 

edit* They can;t be too complex since I have to use flash6 at school :(</description>

<p>Yeah my school is to cheap to update. Flash8 is much more powerful, and I'd use itexcept he's gonna need the project file for flash6, so I can't do it.</p>

<p>Hrm, ideas anyone?</p>
