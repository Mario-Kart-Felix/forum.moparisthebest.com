Definitely not, considering we’re not breaking any of their TOS, right? [/sarcasm]</p>

              <p>Making a private server is illegal and they probarbly could sue you but they wouldnt, jagex has 1,000,000 members paying for membership each month. they earn around £3,000,000-£5,000,000 a month. Plus money from advertisements. and they loose money from workers and bills too. Also jagex arent really bothered about private server’s. i was talking to mod dave and i mentioned private servers(i didnt give any names or information on mopar) and he said that the jagex dosent really care about private servers.</p>

<p>Thug, I dont think Jagex would have cared about StorkPK as much if they didnt have a copy of their client on Stork’s site. Because, in theory, developing and running a server shouldn’t get you into trouble. Its completely legal to make something yourself from the bottom up, but its illegal if you are reverse engineering the RS2 client. Anyways, Jagex would have to prove you reverse engineered it too.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Uhm what…? They have their protocol copyrighted as well… And who said this is only about RS2? This includes RSC.</p>

<p>It is illegal, if you host copyrighted material.</p>
<p>The thing is, in all cases you might not necessarily be breaking the law directly, but JaGeX can afford 10x better lawyers than you can, and if they wanted to they could sue you for just about anything they wanted.</p>

              <p>Lmfao, so the server i’ve played on for like 1-2 months had a client that I downloaded.<br>
So that’s illegal then.<br>
Anyways, the owner didn’t feel like hosting it anymore so he shut it down.<br>

They shut down Runescape Classic??? :S<br>

No, i said Stork and rscd (Both private rsc servers ) had more players on them than the real runescape classic servers that jagex own. Which is probably why they shut them both down.[/quote]<br>
