    <description>Ok I just added a new custom item and everything is perfect except for that when you equip the weapon and move your view on the server the item is invisible like where the weapon would be in front of your character its invisible in some place and when you shift your view it becomes visible again can someone tell me what kind of error this is because i dont wana an item to keep being invisible like that I want it to be totally visible always.

I dont no if this matters but its exion&#39;s base.</description>
