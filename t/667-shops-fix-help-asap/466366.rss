    <description>Hello Everyone, im currently looking for some help with a project 667

I tried adding a new shop with new currency to buy from that shop and it&#39;s not working no matter what.

Yes i edited npchandler.java and such. and most of my shops don&#39;t work... any ideas?


As well as i would like to know how to edit npc&#39;s health and such, thanks(:</description>
