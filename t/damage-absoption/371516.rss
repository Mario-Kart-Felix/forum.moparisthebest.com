<p>50 99 1 with 94 hp, 99 range and magic, 44 prayer works out to be 77 combat. If those accounts are happy to use magic and melee/range against people in armour then there’s no reason that they can’t kill tonnes of armoured players.</p>

<p>Ehh, this update surprised me a lot. They are revamping their entire combat system to incorporate this damage soaking. This is a pretty massive update, so it’s going to be interesting to see the reactions and successes/failures of it. I think it’s going to make battles last a lot longer now, making special items and such a lot harder to get. We’ll see, I guess.<br>
[/quote]Yea, I agree that high level battles (with both people having a high defense) might last a lot longer.</p>

<p>Which is fucking horrible in F2P, since high level fights with armor on take forever anyways.<br>

Ehh, this update surprised me a lot. They are revamping their entire combat system to incorporate this damage soaking. This is a pretty massive update, so it’s going to be interesting to see the reactions and successes/failures of it. I think it’s going to make battles last a lot longer now, making special items and such a lot harder to get. We’ll see, I guess.<br>
[/quote]Yea, I agree that high level battles (with both people having a high defense) might last a lot longer.[/quote]<br>
Which is fucking horrible in F2P, since high level fights with armor on take forever anyways.</p>

The problem is that if they’re identical then their demand, and therefore price, is coupled together – the arguably easier to acquire player-created weapons/armour will drop in price, and no reason will exist to pay for the exotic monster-dropped gear in the eyes of your functional player, thus inducing a drop in value that reflects the drop in value of the player-created gear.</p>

I don’t think that they will allow to create ‘special’ items such as Bandos, Dragon, etc.<br>
But I’m sure if they did, they wouldn’t make it with a mine an ore and smith it, if that is the case; they would probably create a certain percentage to get it.<br>
Some small percentage such as 12%.</p>
