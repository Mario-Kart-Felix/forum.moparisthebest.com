    <description>Alright so I fixed my compiler and it works just fine. I can change NPC&#39;s, what they drop, shops, etc. etc.

But when I go and try to code things in player.assistant, config, gui, rs interface, and a few other areas I will change it and then compile. Everything goes well up until I attempt to login to my server. It always brings up an error connection message. So I then have to go back and change that area to the way it was before to log back on. I experienced this error a lot and wondered what I&#39;m doing wrong?</description>
