    <title>Hi guys, im back</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hi-guys-im-back/111850</link>
    <description>hi guys, i havent been on here for ages, maybe over a year because i quit runescape because it screwed up my modem, pissed me off and was gay.
after a while i got bored with nothing to do and remembered how much i wanted to hack runescape or something.

so i decided yeah that should be a good challenge and came back here...

i am learning delphi scripting language now and decided if the java client connects with the server so can executables.
first off the guys who got the server code to make public servers, can i see it please!!! so i can look for things to exploit, like the loggin thing to get passwords.
not that id use that, i only mean for, erm, autoing and stuff</description>

<p>That’s not gonna work buddy, just quit while you are ahead. Infact, there’s almost no logic behind anything you just said.</p>
<p>I swear you did a couple of levels on <a href="http://hackthissite.org" rel="nofollow noopener">hackthissite.org</a> and now you think your some amazing hacker.</p>
