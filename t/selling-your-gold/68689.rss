    <title>Selling your gold?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/selling-your-gold/68689</link>
    <description>Well, just wondered if anyone here sells their gold for real money? Im thinking of setting up a few gold farming computors out of some old junk parts I have and was wondering, is it possible to net yourself a good profit from selling gold? I know their is ebay, but unfortunatly I&#39;d have to wait a few months to use it (aged 17) and with my mum going through a divorce, no wierd suspisious finances can appear on her statements so ebay is out of the question.

I went to a gold selling site, selling millions/$8. They would buy my gold, at $2.50 per million! that leaves them a profit margin of about 300%! 

Any good forums with active, trustworthy buyers?

Thanks &lt;3</description>

<p>I haven’t actually looked into flax picking, and your example was great <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I have 3 PC’s!</p>
<p>Could you point me in the right direction of the script you used to base your calculations on?</p>
<p>Thanks for the informative post![/quote]</p>
<p>Well you are smart for your first &lt;10 posts. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Yeah, you can proxy in. They block UK ip’s to keep all JAGeX employees out, I have no idea why but I’m from the UK too so just proxy in. JAGeX could get on yes but in my opinion it would be unprofessional to avoid an obvious ban(they might not know about the site though!!), so maybe they don’t.</p>
<p>“Could you point me in the right direction of the script you used to base your calculations on?”</p>
<p>I used a normal calculator providing you get 27(selling at 90gp each) flax in 3 minutes(I’m used to fishing 27 sharks or whatever, wrong calculation as well :P), then just worked out how much you’d get per day and timed it by how many times you’d get in x weeks.</p>
<p>In 2 weeks(28 flax per 3 minutes, 90gp each) you’d actually get 54.4 million gp, approx $324, or £216(at £4 per mill). But if your serious about doing it, I suggest you make a free website(or you can pay but it doesn’t matter, don’t forget to submit it to google) where user’s can submit a form so you can deliver it to them, I have as a newb(August 2005) bought 2 mill(I forgot) for £20, as back then mills where a <span class="bbcode-b">LOT</span> more expensive.</p>
<p>Anyways if you need help setting up SCAR or something(maybe you should try either ARGA or IBot(both java bots) as you can use multiple bots on a pc, not sure of the ban ratio though)) just PM me or contact me on the <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> irc, <a href="http://irc.moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">irc.moparisthebest.com</a>.</p>

              <p>Usually gold is priced $4-$6.</p>
<p>Providing you have 3 PC’s(example), and you have 9~ flax pickers all level 40-50(doesn’t take long, just train def, prayer and str, range or mage or whatever) all picking flax around the clock, you pick around 540~ per hour, and change characters every 8 hours, in 24 hours you’ll make roughly 3.8M.</p>
<p>To put that in a more reasonable format, your flaxers get banned after 2?? weeks, so after 2 weeks you’ve got roughly 50M, that’s $300 USD,with $45 USD for the characters leaving you with $255 USD. You’ll probably have a hard time selling the mills as your so new and such. What I would suggest is heading over to <a href="http://sythe.org" rel="nofollow noopener">sythe.org</a>(uk IP’s banned), make a few posts and sell mills with a trusted middleman. They don’t like paypal and I’ve seen prices as low as $2 on other payment offers so I’m not sure if it’s for you.</p>
