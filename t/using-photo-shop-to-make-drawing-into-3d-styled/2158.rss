              <p>You can draw three pictures in PS as references, top side and bottom. Then use these as references in the 3D program you use. Then build the model yourself. However if you don't know anything about 3D you shouldn't try, as that'd be going in over your head.</p>

<p>A 3d image? Im assuming you dont know anything about 3d models.</p>

<p>Go download some programs such as blender, wings3d, etc and find some tuts on 3d modelling. To my knowledge, you cant just generate a "3d picture" from a 2d one, how would it become 3 dimensional? It wouldnt make sense.</p>
