    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hi-im-new-to-this-whole-thing/243148</link>
    <description> :( i quit mopar and stuff because i had no clue what i was doing, can somebody help like tell me where to write a script and how to write one? like a basic script from rpg maker vx like..

to say the characters name, you put \n[x]
x= change the number to the character orders meaning slot 1 of characters would be ralph so he would say

&quot;ralph, go to dungeon dori&quot; or somthing.. and how to add pk would help.. anything would help and thanks, when i joined first here, people kept saying i shouldn&#39;t even try it if i don&#39;t know about scripting but learning it is how you know it</description>
