    <description>Don&#39;t like when people disrespect me, or disrespect the community... I wasn&#39;t going to release this.. But he was too pussy to respond to me on Mopar so I decided to post. Snoopy(iatex) is a fucking tool. 
Crooks(xpectz) is a cool person. He even knows snoopy is a retard. We&#39;ve had a few talks on msn about his dumb ass.

&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]11:32:18 PM  Me: Hey [/b]
11:33:25 PM  Iatex - New updates coming today!!!: wat 
[b]11:33:30 PM  me: Yo? [/b]
11:33:39 PM  Iatex - New updates coming today!!!: go fuck youself&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Kid says this to me. After all I&#39;ve done for him. Recruited just about EVERY single person to his server, coded for him. Did nothing to &#39;harm&#39; him at all. 

Snoopy is a tool. Doesn&#39;t know a single thing about coding. Kid didn&#39;t even know what to do when the XP on the server got boosted. He was all mad and didn&#39;t know how to fix it. He didn&#39;t know where the XP multiplier was. So I had to tell him. Learn to code before you make a server next time homo.

[u]This post should NOT be deleted, or locked because this kid disrespects everyone in the community and I helped on this Source.[/u] Also. It&#39;s EASY RSC, with a few edits. So it should NOT be locked. Thanks in advanced.

~Thanks

Oh yea release you gratest XML work you took from another server I had to clean up you ::town command which basically was taken from another source. and ou where to stupid to set a timer on it so people could teleport from pking and dueling and much more. you didn’t do shit expect a few xml edit, continue to be a fool you live up to it.[/quote]<br>
I didn’t go on xpectz and ban anyone b4 u de-modded me. Don’t lie retard. I went on xpectz AFTER you de-modded me and banned stego, and was going to unban.<br>
XML work I took? From where? and the town command could only be used by <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">ADMINS and MODS</span></span>. You fucking retard.<br>
I did FAR more to the server than you did. And the funny thing is, I didn’t do too much.<br>
It’s funny how you talk shit to Yong min, saying he’s a “Chink” and he can’t type… But you’re English is fucking HORRIBLE and you can barely construct a sentence.</p>

If people want to make a server they should just take some time and learn it.
