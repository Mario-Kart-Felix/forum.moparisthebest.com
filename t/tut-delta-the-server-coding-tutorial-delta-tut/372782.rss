Ok, i&#39;m making this tut for all u newbies out there who need help coding their server.

in this thread, we will be covering:


[ul][li]Simple teleport commands[/li]
[li]Add item commands[/li]
[li]commands that open interfaces[/li]
[li]The 100 errors on compiling error[/li]
[li]The Admin, Owner &amp; Moderator rights system[/li][/ul]


[u][b]Ok, Now for a quick introduction to simple coding:[/b][/u]

Ok, now, the server coding language: JAVA is a script/coding language used in the creating of programmes, servers, websites etc... in order to create a server, you must understand the properties of java.

There are many ways to learn java, but i find the easiest way is to just stuff around with it till&#39; you get the hang of it.

Now, we move on...

[u][b][size=12pt]Simple Teleport Commands[/size][/b][/u]

Ok, Teleporting is a very big deal in a private server, but how do we make it become a reality?

Teleport commands such as ::home or ::train are one of the easiest commands to add.

[u]Here is the code for adding the ::home command:[/u]

[code]if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;home&quot;)) {
        if(!inCombat) {
                toX = 2606;
                toY = 3093;

        } else {
                sM(&quot;You must be out of combat to teleport&quot;);
        }
}[/code]

This code, if added correctly, will enable a player to teleport to a specific location, such as home with ease!

ok, so here&#39;s a run-down of the command code:

the: [code]if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;home&quot;)) {[/code] part of the code
is the command players will use to teleport to their location. the &quot;home&quot; part is the command name (i.e. ::home). For example: If you were to change the (&quot;home&quot;)) part of the command to (&quot;gohome&quot;))
the command would be ::gohome instead of ::home

now for the [code]if(!inCombat) {
                toX = 2606;
                toY = 3093;

        } else {
                sM(&quot;You must be out of combat to teleport&quot;);
        }
}

[/code] part of the command:

Well,  the: [code]if(!inCombat) {[/code] part is the variable for if a player is in combat. This will not allow a player to use the command if they are fighting something/someone &amp; they will have to retreat from combat to use the command.

this part: [code]} else {
                sM(&quot;You must be out of combat to teleport&quot;);
        }
}[/code] makes the &quot;You must be out of combat to teleport&quot; message come up when a player is in combat and tries to teleport. The [code]} else }[/code] part is what makes the message able to appear and disallows a player to teleport.

and the  [code]toX = 2606;
                toY = 3093;[/code] part is the x &amp; y coords of which a player is teleported to when they type the command. (toX = x coord, toY = y coord)

once you have added that, a player may now use the command: ::home

Now, if you only want a specific group to be able to use a command you simply add &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 1) infront of the command: e.g: 			

[code]if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;staffzone&quot;)&amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 1){
toX = 2580;
toY = 3299;
heightLevel = 0;
pEmote = 1979;

sM(&quot;welcome to the staffzone, be greatful for your position!&quot;);


}[/code]

[size=14pt][u]Add item commands[/u][/size]

ok, now if you want a player to be able to do a command that adds an item to their inventory when they do it, here is what to do:

Here is a simple add item command:

[code]if (command.startsWith(&quot;ahrims&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 2) {
			addItem(4708, 1);
			addItem(4710, 1);
			addItem(4712, 1);
			addItem(4714,1);
			}[/code]

if an admin types ::ahrims, some ahrims armour will appear in their inventory

Code explanation: the [code]if (command.startsWith(&quot;ahrims&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 2) {[/code] part of the code is the command they will type and the player rights needed to do so.

the [code]addItem(4708, 1);
			addItem(4710, 1);
			addItem(4712, 1);
			addItem(4714,1);[/code]
part of the code is the items they will recieve.

this part here: [code]addItem(4708, 1);[/code] is the item and item amount that will be added to the players inventory. 4708 = the item id, 1 = the amount of the item id that will be added.

it&#39;s quite simple really.

[size=14pt][u]Commands that open interfaces[/u][/size]

Ok, Now, Interfaces are the stuff like quest scrolls that pop up on screen when you click a quest.

these are very good things to added if you want to display allot of information to a player.

here is an example of a command the opens up an interface:

[code]if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;staffapply&quot;) &amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt;= 0)) {
                                String name = command.substring(5);
                                        sendQuest(&quot;@dre@Staff apply&quot;, 8144);  //Title
                                        sendQuest(&quot;Info&quot;, 8145);
                                        clearQuestInterface();
                                        sendQuest(&quot;Staff spots currently available: @red@Full! &quot;, 8148);
                                        sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 8149);
                                        sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 8150);
										sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 8151);
										sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 8152);
										sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 8153);
                                        sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 8154);
                                        sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 8155);
                                        sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 8156);
                                        sendQuestSomething(8143);
                                        showInterface(8134);
                                        flushOutStream();


}[/code]

basically this meens if a player types ::staffapply ingame this interface will come up with:

&quot;Staff spots currently available: @red@Full!&quot; in a quest scroll - like interface.

now for the code explanation: the [code]if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;staffapply&quot;) &amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt;= 0)) {[/code] part is the command a player will type whilst ingame for the interface to pop up.

the [code]String name = command.substring(5);
                                        sendQuest(&quot;@dre@Staff apply&quot;, 8144);  //Title
                                        sendQuest(&quot;Info&quot;, 8145);
                                        clearQuestInterface();
                                        sendQuest(&quot;Staff spots currently available: @red@Full! &quot;, 8148);
                                        sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 8149);
                                        sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 8150);
										sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 8151);
										sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 8152);
										sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 8153);
                                        sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 8154);
                                        sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 8155);
                                        sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 8156);
                                        sendQuestSomething(8143);
                                        showInterface(8134);[/code]

part is the text that will show up on the scroll.

all you simply have to do is add this to client.java, make any changes to the text/command name, save &amp; compile.

[size=14pt][u]The 100 errors while compiling error:[/u][/size]

It&#39;s a coders worst nightmare....100 errors.

Don&#39;t fret! it&#39;s just something very simple!!! it simply meens you forgot to add a } somewhere in a method or you have to many }&#39;s in the method.

just find where you&#39;ve forgot to add one/added to many and fix it!


[size=14pt][u][b]The Admin, Owner &amp; Moderator rights system[/b][/u][/size]

Ok, finally we are onto the rights system!

this is very simple:

[code]
0 = normal
1 = mod
2 = admin
3 = owner[/code]

when in a command if you want to make a command accessible only to a specific group, all you have to do is add [code]&amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt;= # here)[/code] next to the command code!

and your command will only be able to be accessed by the certain member group of your choice!

I hope this tutorial helped you out, if you need any more help/want to talk about it with others, reply below!

reccommend this to your friends, family, local neigbourhood hobos, hobos from other neighbourhoods, anyone who you think this tut could help out!

until then,

Have a good evening, and a satisfactory tommorrow!

<p>part is the text that will show up on the scroll.</p>
<p>all you simply have to do is add this to client.java, make any changes to the text/command name, save &amp; compile.</p>
<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-u">The 100 errors while compiling error:</span>[/size]</p>
<p>It’s a coders worst nightmare…100 errors.</p>
<p>Don’t fret! it’s just something very simple!!! it simply meens you forgot to add a } somewhere in a method or you have to many }'s in the method.</p>
<p>just find where you’ve forgot to add one/added to many and fix it!</p>
<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">The Admin, Owner &amp; Moderator rights system</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p>Ok, finally we are onto the rights system!</p>
<p>this is very simple:</p>
<p><code>
0 = normal
1 = mod
2 = admin
3 = owner</code></p>
<p>when in a command if you want to make a command accessible only to a specific group, all you have to do is add <code>&amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt;= # here)</code> next to the command code!</p>
<p>and your command will only be able to be accessed by the certain member group of your choice!</p>
