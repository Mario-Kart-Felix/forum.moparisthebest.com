    <title>Help with Action Handler</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-action-handler/469766</link>
    <description>Okay I addressed this problem before and got some help but it didnt solve the issue. I am making a minigame wher you need to kill certain npc&#39;s to move on and at the end you click something and get 100m gp. (the npc&#39;s have had changes with hp and lvls)
But my issue is I can just click the portals and move on with out killing the npc&#39;s. I tried one code someone gave me but it didn&#39;t work so I modified it a bit and got less errors but still didnt fix the problem. Any help would be great .
