    <description>Hello, I have just recently bought my new laptop and was wondering if anybody could help me create my server, I used to have a server of my own back in 2008 :P  I have forgotten parts of how to construct a server. I would appreciate it and be very grateful if you would help construct my server. I am on windows 7.


[EDIT]: I WOULD LIKE A SILAB SERVER :P 317

                    JDK 6 update 19
