    <title>Internet! ~~ Need someone with Internet knowledge! ~~</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/internet-need-someone-with-internet-knowledge/119043</link>
    <description>K, listen, this is probably in the wrong section but, i could get no help irl, no help online, and cuz u guys know alot about computers, i decided to turn here....

Okay this is my problem, i connect to the internet fine, because for No-ip, you need an internet connection ofc... and i can run my server fine...but then, when i try to load the Internet page, it says on the status bar &quot;done&quot; &quot;page loaded&quot; or w/e it says, and the page is blank.. happens to every page i try and get on... It wont let me logg in to msn for some reason, it was fine a couple of weeks ago... its just not working now.

If anyone knows why this problem is occuring, please do mention before and if this topic gets locked!
i would really apreciat it, thanks alot ;)!</description>
