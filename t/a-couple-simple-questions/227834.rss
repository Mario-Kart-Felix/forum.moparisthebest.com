    <title>A Couple Simple Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-couple-simple-questions/227834</link>
    <description>I Used To Make RuneScape Private Servers About 10 Months Ago, But With All The Changes In RuneScape, It Made A lot Of Changes In Private Servers As Well, So I Have A Few Basic Questions
A Couple Of These Could Probably Be Answered If I Searched Around, But There Are A Couple Of Them And I Don&#39;t Have Much Time With School Starting Tomorrow And Everything, So Sorry For My Laziness.

-What Is The Most Updated Client? (e.g. Silabsoft Client Or MoparScape Client, etc..)

-Do You Know Any Source That Is Most Like The Real RuneScape That Will Work For That Client? (e.g. Doesn&#39;t Have Uber Fast Exp...)

-Any Recommendations For Anything Extra?

Thanks For Your Time For Reading This, And For Answering, In Advance.</description>
