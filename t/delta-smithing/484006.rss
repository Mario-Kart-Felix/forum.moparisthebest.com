    <title>[Delta] Smithing?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-smithing/484006</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve been looking around mopar and google for quite a while now looking for a tut on how to add smithing to a delta sorce, but cn&#39;t find anything. My base i downloaded had it set so when bars were used on an anvil you get coins. I want to find a way to add the correct smithing interface and actually be able to make items.

If anyone knows of a tut or at least can help me get started with this i would be very thankful  :)</description>
