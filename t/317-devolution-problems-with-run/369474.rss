    <description>This isn&#39;t portforwarding, Ik how to do that, just that I myself can&#39;t connect to it. It has the local IP set. It isn&#39;t portforwarded yet, which I don&#39;t want it to. But in the server part of files, I try to click run, and it says this.

[code]Error occurred during initialization of VM
Could not reserve enough space for object heap
Could not create Java virtual machine.
Press any key to continue...[/code]

It compiles fine, I have my paths set with JDK Version 6 Update 22. Latest version. And it goes fine on my friends computer. I have Windows XP. If you need any more info on how to fix it, then ask. :s I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong.

Here is what&#39;s in my Run file that I&#39;m having trouble with.

[code]@echo off
title Server
java -Xmx1024m -cp .;./jython.jar;./MySql/mysql-connector-java-3.0.17-ga-bin.jar server
pause
[/code]</description>
