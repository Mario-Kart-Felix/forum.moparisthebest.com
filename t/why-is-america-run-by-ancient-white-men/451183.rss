    <title>Why is America run by ancient white men?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-is-america-run-by-ancient-white-men/451183</link>
    <description>While the president himself is not that ancient, Biden is. Most politicians are over 40, and in most cases, over 50. Bush and Cheney were ancient, Kerry was ancient, etc. Why is there a limit on the minimum age you can be to be POTUS? Is it because they want the running candidates to be apathetic to the populations desires? Its well known that as you get older, your senses are dulled. So why is there a minimum age limit?

If anything, there should be a maximum age limit. No one over 40 should be allowed in office. I want young people in the House and the Senate, not some sleazy white guys who only care about there next pay check. I&#39;m tired of seeing old men with graying hair running our country. This is America, land of the free, not America land of the drooping grandpa&#39;s.

I think that people over 40 should not be allowed in the House, the Senate, or the White House.

Thoughts?

I apologise for my increase in threads in this section, I just enjoy reading and listening to those whom respond.</description>

George Washington, while not entirely poor wasn’t considered “wealthy” either, he became President</p>

<p>You need to be at least 35 years old to become President of the United States.</p>
<p>They seem old because they have been around politics for quite some time, you can look back in the 90’s of Obama giving speeches. Not like they came out of nowhere and decided one day “I want to be President” They worked for it, and it takes years to build into that. Not to mention it costs millions to even get your name out there of your candidacy.</p>

I didn’t deny that senators were rich, I deny that it was the problem.<br>
Back to Romney, the problem isn’t that he is rich. The problem is that he are in it for the profit, not seeking to help the majority.</p>

              <p>That’s the one major flaw with our (The United State’s) governing system. It relies on the fact that good people will do the right thing. With a population more seemingly interested in wealth rather than doing the right thing, I sometimes worry. People think the USA has been here for ages and always will be, but people forget we are actually a very young country. The Aztec empire flourished for 2000 years until the Spanish conquistadors came over. We have only been here for a fraction of that time. Do I think the country is on the verge of a collapse? No.</p>
<p>I also don’t think being run by “ancient white men” is a bad thing. With age comes wisdom, correct?</p>
