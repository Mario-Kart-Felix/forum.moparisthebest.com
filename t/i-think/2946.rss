    <description>I think that the next time a bot is released, the board in which it is in should be INVISIBLE to people who haven&#39;t had an interview with Mopar or any other highly known and trusted person

Of course you know the reason ;) (in case you don&#39;t, we don&#39;t want the Jagex Employees to have access to the source of our bots; it helps them better understand [b]how[/b] our bots work, and therefore making their game more anti-cheatable)</description>

              <p>I learned Java through a class <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>3 years so far, but i jsut recently got into this cheating stuff… well, community cheats after somebody posted some code on another site, i liked it and found mopars site.</p>
<p>Ive been forced to learn alot of java to compete in state competitions and stuff like that, which is basically: how is this code wrong? and what will this output?</p>
<p>Ive read a few books though, maybe 4 or 5, onw im reading now is pretty cool, its called “Developing games in Java”</p>
<p>ha, u know about me too <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>btw… i know nothing of this stuff you guys are talking about, although i can learn languages pretty quick now, ive never decompiled code, and the first time ive ever seen decompiled code was when that person sent me part of an old client…</p>
<p>anyways, you will be seeing more of me around here, I though cheating communities were bad until while reading these posts ive seen that it isnt the programmers that are bad, its the leechers <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>besides, yall are getting WAAAAAY ahead of yourselves, we cant even get a decent deob yet, lets focus on one thing at a time instead of talking about the “next bot”</p>
<p>[quote=“Ben, post:21, topic:2946”]Lol you read books to learn Java?<br>
You got any peice of knowledge you want on the net, all you gotta do is ask google your question and you get an endless amount of answers <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I learned Java just the way you all say you shouldn’t. I copied code, I modified code, I made scripts, but I never read a book. After a week or two I got the hang of it.</p>
<p>The most important thing in learning how to program is reading the code, the more you read the code the better you understand it - just like in your own language. The more your parents talked to you when you were a baby the faster you learned how to talk.</p>
<p>Ok I got carried away for abit…</p>
<p>And another thing, I doubt there will be a bot out if you won’t be sharing your code. There is no RegeX, Sean, Saev or Kaitnieks to do anything, it’s just you all. If not each of you will share his knowledge you’ll probably never reach results.</p>
<p>And if you think that this engine update was because they were taking a look at your bots then you are probably wrong, because he started working on it 6 months ago. They knew since RSC age that their client’s sourcecode was being decompiled and deobfuscated and it probably was on their To do list for about a year now.[/quote]</p>
<p>thats how I learned Java and SCAR ;D</p>

<p>Me too! Over the course of last summer though.</p>
<p>I resent that sentiment, but if that’s the way you feel then I’d like to point out that results can be achieved by sharing knowledge, not code. Knowledge &gt; code. How do you think Kaitnieks and RegeX learned RS2? They were all part of the earlier <a href="http://kaitnieks.com" rel="nofollow noopener">kaitnieks.com</a> client research boom (which has not been resurrected since Aryan). The way to get people to make something is to put them in a place where the only option is to work and collaborate (i.e., no autodeobs &amp; no clue wtf happened to the client :P)</p>

You very obviously do not get the point. This is not about keeping the Bot to ourselves(and therefore being selfish); this is about keeping the bot away from Jagex.

I think everyone should make thier own bots, keep them private.  This eliminates JageX from getting a copy, and you all have unique systems and there will be less autoers to fight against.  Plus, you earn the knowledge of java.</p>
