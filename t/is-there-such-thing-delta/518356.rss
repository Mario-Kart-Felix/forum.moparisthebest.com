    <title>Is there such thing? [Delta]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-there-such-thing-delta/518356</link>
    <description>I just added chaotic maul but I would like to change the attack style to the hammer attack style, but i&#39;m not sure how to do so.  I used Item &quot;pickup&quot; command and a  rune warhamer and torags hammers and they don&#39;t have the attack style, so I&#39;m wondering if delta has the hammer attack style and if it does how would I go about putting this/giving these items the right attack style
Thanks for your help</description>
