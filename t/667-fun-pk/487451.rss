    <title>[667] Fun PK?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/667-fun-pk/487451</link>
    <description>Hello,
So today I was thinking of adding like a semi-minigame to my 667, and i want the arena to be a funpk based area. I was wondering if there is any possible way to make a FunPK in a 667, because i cannot find a tutorial ANYWHERE!
Thanks in advance for any help you have to offer.</description>
