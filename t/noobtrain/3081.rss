    <description>I used it on Aryan and worked VERY WELL. Has anyone seen\have a script that is similar to it?

What NoobTrain does is it starts you off at goblins behind lumby and goes around and kills goblins untill he\she dies. The char. then walks back behind lumby and kills more goblins untill you stop it.

I would be willing to pay for it but it MUST be for SCAR, since aryan is dead  :(.

Thanks,
