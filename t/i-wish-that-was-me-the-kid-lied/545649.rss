Yeah there’s no way that kid is 12, or developed an app that successful at age 9 otherwise more people would’ve heard about it. Also wtf is he doing driving at 12? Do countries even allow drivers that young?<br>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Went looking to see what kind of app could have made 8.5m dollars in a year after google takes the cut, came up with this:</p>
<blockquote>The YouTube video of a 12 year old from the UK, named Callum, was a hoax. FGearTV, the people behind the interview, have admitted. The interview video which went viral last week was of a 12 year old boy who claimed of being the owner of three Ferrari supercars. This made him the youngest person to ever own a Ferrari. The story told was that Callum earned £8.5 million by selling an app to Google when he was 9, with which he bought a Ferrari, and followed it up with two more, a 458 Italia and a 599GTO.
<p>Several people who watched the video did have their doubts though. For starts, Callum does not reveal any details about the deal he had with Google. Not even the name of the app. Nevertheless, the video went on to gets lakhs of views for FGearTV and income through advertising. Finally perhaps, FGearTV though they had earned enough and it was time to bring out the truth, at least for the people who still believed it to be true.</p>
<p>Following is the official statement published by FGearTV, which is accompanied by a new video where the truth is revealed. It turns out, even the interviewer was taken for a wild ride. For those who never watched the original videos we have included the them in the gallery.</p>
<p>“It’s been a week since we uploaded the video about Callum and his 3 Ferrari’s and we decided it was now time to tell you the real story.<br>
The video was filmed for two reasons. First as an update to the original video we did about Callum and his Ferrari 355 (which belongs to his father) and secondly to have a bit of fun with the Presenter, Yusef who thought the whole thing was real. He’s not acting, he really did think Callum was for real.<br>
What makes the whole thing such great viewing is that it was all unscripted and unplanned. We bumped into Callum and Paul at a recent event and in the video Callum was making things up as he went along. The guy is amazing and one of the nicest kids you could possibly meet!!!<br>
And yes… he really is 12 years old.<br>
Contrary to what has been written on websites and forums around the world, no one is promoting anything, selling anything or trying to be deceitful in anyway. In fact fGearTV is slowly winding down as we are now concentrating on another video channel.<br>
It was just a bit of harmless fun that went a little viral.<br>
We hope you enjoyed it and weren’t offended in any way.<br>
Many thanks to Callum, Paul and Yusef and Paul.<br>
The video above contains additional footage which should explain everything.<br>
Remember, the Presenter thinks it’s all real and is not in on the joke.<br>
Best wishes to all.<br>
The fGear team”</p>
