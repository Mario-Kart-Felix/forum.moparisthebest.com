    <description>First of all I would like to thank you for viewing my thread. Sadly, I have yet to come up with a name for this server that I am developing but i&#39;m sure I&#39;ll think of one soon. The server I&#39;m creating consists of all Free-To-Play (F2P) items and those items only, a Member&#39;s version of the server will be created if the F2P is successful, and the Member&#39;s and Free-To-Play will be up at the same time on different ports.

[b]Base:[/b]An early release of Devolution by Killamess

[b]Goal:[/b]Well, all I really want to do is host a successful F2P server that consists of good combat, a great economy, and a successful community.

[b]Details:[/b]Currently the combat is excellent with both Range and Mage following aswell as defense levels, and armor effecting the hits of all of this. Another thing that I find personally good is the use of full smithing in my server, most servers over look this skill and basically give the player money when they attempt to make something, mine has the full interface for each and every type of bar, this being my favorite skill, I put a lot of time into it. Fishing (another one of my favorite skills) is defiantly one of the best skills on this server, all the spots work with the correct requirements and both options work (Bait,Lure, Etc.). This is probably going to be one of the best money making ways on the server. As for now that&#39;s all I feel like typing I will update this on a daily basis.

Sorry for such little information of the server at the moment I jsut started it a week ago and I personally believe I&#39;ve gotten pretty far.

[i]Any questions about the server, I will be more than happy to answer :)[/i]

[b]Beta is expected early on next week.[/b]</description>
