    <title>Hacked on Runescape</title>

    <description>Hey Guys,

I am a level 117 on Runescape and i got hacked about a month ago for 250M cash. I lost everything, Then i recovered my account and made 15M then after I&#39;d got enough money to start making more money i got hacked again. I&#39;m not sure what to do to get all of my cash back?

Ideas?</description>

              <p>[quote=“CoonHunter, post:3, topic:387752”]Generally, if you can convince Jagex of the problem via parents emailing service (i had to use this) they can wipe all data back to the original when the account was first created. I had to do this when RS4Gold had a mixup between me buying 5M and selling my account. I sent them the money, and all of a sudden, what I sent them, plus the offer before-hand was put into my paypal, got that fixed but they refused the account. I hacked it back, and had to convince Jagex there was an issue, and someone must have known my info, so they wiped it back to the originals. Now, RS4Gold emails me 2-3 times a week asking for assistance on getting my account back lol.</p>
<p>Basically, if you can manage to convince Jagex your account information was leaked, and you need it wiped, they MIGHT do it.[/quote]</p>
<p>I did that a long time ago to my account.</p>
