    <title>Client user ID upon reconnect, need clarification</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-user-id-upon-reconnect-need-clarification/554665</link>
    <description>If the client reconnects using status code 18, does it send the same user ID it sent upon initial login?

I assume yes because that&#39;s the only practical use the user id would have.

EDIT: for the people maintaining the RS Wiki, at stage 3 of the login protocol there is 1 byte missing
after &quot;client version&quot; the client also sends another byte indicating if the client is lowmem or highmem</description>

<p>so say you’re running 2 clients at once, do they use the same uid?[/quote]</p>
<p>iirc the name hash is used to determine a login server but that is irrelevant.</p>
<p>[code=java]<br>
private static int getUid(String prefix) {<br>
try {<br>
File uid = new File(prefix + “uid.dat”);<br>
if (!uid.exists() || uid.length() &lt; 4) {<br>
try (DataOutputStream os = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(prefix + “uid.dat”))) {<br>
os.writeInt((int) (Math.random() * 99999999));<br>
}<br>
}<br>
} catch (IOException ex) {<br>
}</p>
<pre><code>	try (DataInputStream is = new DataInputStream(new FileInputStream(prefix + "uid.dat"))) {
		return is.readInt() + 1;
	} catch (IOException ex) {
		return 0;
	}
}[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>UID is cached locally in a file named uid.dat (random.dat in newer clients), so unless you explicitly change this then yes the UID of two clients on the same machine would be the same</p>

<p>Yeah but you posted in server help…</p>
<p>Also user id could mean the name hash as well as the randomly generated uid.</p>
<p>The uid you’re speaking of is generated if one does not already exist (random.dat) and that is the same until the uid is deleted.</p>
