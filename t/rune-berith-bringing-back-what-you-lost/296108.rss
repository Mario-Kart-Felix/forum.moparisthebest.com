    <description>Rune-Berith
About:Rune-Berith is a pking server, that instead of the usual pk servers were everything is in 1 town, and every item is in shops Rune-Berith will be a pk server with a REAL economy. The server will be split up over 5 main cities as well as alot of other cities and towns that have importance. The pking has been tested and retested and thanks to some external help it has almost been perfected.

The server is based of primas iClarity 1.5 but has been edited to the point were it is almost unrecognizable, as a player of RSPS&#39;s for over 2 years ive seen what makes servers fun and popular and i think i have the right mix, the server currently has features that have been taken out of the most popular servers such as deltascape and dynasty.

Features:
Combat: The combat on Rune-Berith will be the most important part of the server, for this reason the server will not be reliesed until the PVP and PVN is as close to runescapes as i can get. it is currently better than most servers that are hosted, but im am close to getting combat to the levels of 2specced and Near Reality.

Skills: Due to the server being a pking server, skills will not be a huge part of the server but skills that directly influence pking and the pking economy will be added. As the server progresses i may finish all the skills but that isnt a high priority right now.

Skills:
Herblore 70%
Crafting 90%
Farming 40%
Rune Crafting 75%
Fleching 50%
Woodcutting. 90%
Cooking 40%
Fishing 25%

Please note that these percentages are not how close they are to Runescapes but are instead how close they are to were i want them to be.

Client: The client is based once again off primas iClarity 1.1 client, but has been edited to were i want it, i am currently working on the last interfaces and finishing the J-Frame menu, the client will have items coded into the client but these will not be &quot;Custom&quot; as such, they will be items that were in runescape around the 420 period, i am currently thinking weather i should extend this to adding spirit shields, godswords and pvp amour but that is not important atm.

Forums:I am also developing a website to go along with the server, it has mysql connected so i can added things such as highscores to the website, i am starting on connecting smf or phpbb to it now. [code]Disk Usage  	0 / 1500.0 MB
Bandwidth 	100000 MB (100GB)[/code]
I think that should be plenty for now :P
