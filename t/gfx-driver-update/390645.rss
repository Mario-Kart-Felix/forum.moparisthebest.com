    <title>Gfx driver update</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/gfx-driver-update/390645</link>
    <description>ok. so i dl the correct driver zip from intel, so when i try to install it says get the drivers from toshiba. the problem is the drivers from toshiba are way behind by like a year or so. the current one i installed is 2 years old... i decided to upgrade just to see if i get any performance boost. so intel tell u how to install it manually with their drivers. i do so but i checked the device manager and it says the old drivers are still installed. im going to restart but idky i would have to restart just to see if they were installed.

thanks to anyone that is able to help.</description>

<p>You won’t be getting a new driver then, and I am assuming it is for a laptop. My Dell laptop’s driver is like 2 years behind the regular Intel one, I had to fix compatibility issues by modding my driver to all hell. (not suggested AT ALL), the only thing you can do is chance that you will need a fresh-install of windows, and attempt at modding the driver, or just sit and deal with it.</p>

<p>yes it is a laptop. i ended up uninstalling the gfx driver, then installing the drivers intel provided. the driver is definitely changed, but in device manager it has the same driver version as the old driver, but the driver date is from last month which is when intel released theirs. my windows index rating went down a little for the areo part or w/e but when i did a benchmark with some software i have, it says my graphics have increased. im not sure if im getting better performance b/c of the driver or the fact that i turned of aero. but i am getting more constant(higher) fps on games that i play.</p>
