    <description>Okay so my shitty PC would play just cause at 3-5 fps I downloaded 3d analyzer and I now get 30-35-40 its an amazing life saver I was getting pissed cause this PC would only play games from 06 I played call of duty 4 it lagged but it worked anyone with a shittastic PC should download 3d analyzer and for my vertex shader problem I downloaded Intel management tool 2.0

For the people who don&#39;t know what 3d analyzer is.

This is from the manufactures website

The 3D Analyzer Tool was created and refined to overcome limitations posed by modern 3D Games and other Applications on several current mainstream 3D Cards. With the help of 3DA you can change different graphic options under DirectX 8 and OpenGL. 3DA changes different CAP-bits for example, if a game requires HW T&amp;L 3DA emulates these bits and the games runs on graphic boards which don’t have HW T&amp;L capabilities. 3DA doesn’t emulate any features in software(except cube mapping, which is done with a simple 2D texture), like Pixel or Vertex Shader. 3DA is also a very nice tool for benchmarking. It generates detailed log files (CSV) with FPS and other parameters.
In simple terms, 3D-Analyzer is a tool that can emulate certain graphics options that would typically require a dedicated graphics card; graphics that many integrated chips and older graphics cards are not capable of. So, for example, if you have an outdated graphics card, or an integrated one, it might not support some graphics options such as Pixel Shader 2.0, or hardware TnL (not to worry, you don’t need to know what these mean). Certain 3D games require these, and are not playable without them (like when you have audio but all you see is a blank screen). 3D-Analyzer can help bypass these restrictions and enable you to play that game you’ve always wanted to play

<p>DirectX 8? Do people even still use those old drivers, and if so, what game still supports it? Anyways, thanks I guess, but this isn’t game related at all.</p>

<p>Actually allot of people still have direct x 8 People who have no idea what they are doing I have 11<br>
It helped me play games on my desktop compute hope it helps other people</p>
