    <title>Walking! (For follow when attacking or just following)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/walking-for-follow-when-attacking-or-just-following/92854</link>
    <description>Does anyone know how to move the player from the server? Sort of like teleportToX and Y but instead of teleporting just start making them walk like they clicked? I&#39;m thinking this is pretty easy, but I just can&#39;t seem to find a way  :confused:

I&#39;m trying to make a working follow option  :)

Found public static void updatePlayer(Player plr, stream str) in PlayerHandler.java , can I use this in client.java to make the player walk to a X and Y location?

Please someone, I almost got working following but I can&#39;t make the player walk to any new cords..... (Without Teleing)</description>
