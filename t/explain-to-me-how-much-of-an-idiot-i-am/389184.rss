    <title>Explain to me how much of an idiot I am?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/explain-to-me-how-much-of-an-idiot-i-am/389184</link>
    <description>When I bought my external HD a few months ago (this story isn&#39;t related to the other topic about an external HD), I didn&#39;t bother formatting it (idiot +1) so it used fat32. I found out that Iso&#39;s were too large for it, but I already had quite a collection of audio and video on the HD so I decided to put Iso&#39;s on my internal HD. But a few days ago, my internal started to get full, so I downloaded Parted Magic and used it to make my fat32 partition smaller, and create a new partition and format it in ntfs. All went well, so I moved most of my files (the 1TB disk was filled more than 50%) to my new partition. No problem there.

So yesterday I decided that I wanted one partition (idiot++). So I made my fat32 partition even smaller, and wanted to add the unallocated space to the ntfs partition. A feasible plan. Gparted states that it takes 4 hours to read the data, which is fine. But when the 4 hours were over, it needed another 7-8 hours to write. I didn&#39;t want to wait that long, so I made my master move: I cancelled the write procedure (idiot + ∞). 

When I rebooted Windows, it asked to test the consistency of the disk. It checked it, it fixed a few things and booted. Now, the data is still there. Even the meta-data of every single song is fine. But nothing works anymore. I can&#39;t watch the movies, can&#39;t listen to my music.


Are there any methods to fix the data, or is everything lost?</description>

<p>I haven’t tried yet, but I guess I can. I can access all the data via Windows, I can open them but for instance an mp3 starts to play and stops immediately after, without actually playing a single note. .txt files are made up of Asian characters.</p>
<p>ownagesbot: I’ll try it, but isn’t there something similar in Parted Magic?</p>

              <p>Kinda sounds like your MFT is either corrupted, with the indexes pointing at the wrong place, or it’s corrupted in a way that it still points to the data, but the data is gone.<br>
In any case, do what ownagesbot said above, I suppose it wouldn’t hurt.<br>
Can you still access the data from linux, btw?</p>
