That was one example of many.<br>
The point behind it was to prove that even if you’re not using the same programming language, if your concept is <span class="bbcode-i">too similar</span> (I think copying runescape’s landscape and map design would be too similar) then you can still get caught for copyright infringement.</p>

<p>Basically if this was to happen with runescape all you need to do to get sued is this.<br>
Code the shit in a © based language if you feeling saucy and has happened in this forum (3) times?<br>
Then name the game “Runecape” and get sued.</p>

<p>The way it works, is you have to have a detailed plan of how you’re doing the idea. Then you have a certain amount of time to create what you patented or its thrown out the window. This is why there are so many different door handles, the door handles have the same purpose but they were designed/functions are different.</p>

I’m writing this reply solely on the answers I have got while I asked around while doing the project; You can make a game exactly like RSC but you would need different artwork including landscape, you can’t make exact same copy as I had planned. You can take bits and pieces from the original landscape but most of it must be your work.[/quote]</p>
<p>Just shifting the color values and keeping the “design” the same with the combination of a different format and the way the client handles it as I mentioned earlier is enough. If you’re in court, you just pull up google earth and show in real life locations of where you got it from. You’re going to be sued for replicating designs on google earth? They are making a mockery of the court system your honor and I demand all fees for this nonsense to be covered by the opposite party. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> You can make up any reason for why you came up with the design and act stupid. What it would come down to is the amount of tiles, width/height of some locations in the world. If you show 10 tiles from a wall to the water and they have the same thing, you would need to change it. Those small changes will make the difference because the judge will be looking at those calculations.</p>

I’m writing this reply solely on the answers I have got while I asked around while doing the project; You can make a game exactly like RSC but you would need different artwork including landscape, you can’t make exact same copy as I had planned. You can take bits and pieces from the original landscape but most of it must be your work.</p>

You can’t directly copy their landscape as far as I know. Hence why I scrapped this project:<br>
