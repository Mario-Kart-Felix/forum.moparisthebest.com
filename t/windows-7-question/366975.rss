Anyway the &quot;w&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;s&quot; &quot;a&quot;  are the directional buttons. and the mouse is to look from side to side and up and down. well when i try to move up with &quot;w&quot; and try to look around with the mouse i can&#39;t. so i thought it was the game, but when i did it outside the game it did the same thing. Has anyone else had this problem. If so can you tell me how to fix.</description>

I don’t know i fixed it. I just can’t use the mouse pad. So i got a regular opticle mouse and it works fine now.</p>
