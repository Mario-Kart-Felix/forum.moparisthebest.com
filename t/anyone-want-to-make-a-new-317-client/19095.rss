              <p>Ok, that clarifies things more, one day when I get extremely bored I may fix factor to work with 317.  Until that day I’ll just live with it renamed to aryan spec.</p>

              <p>I have no idea what ruler is saying now. What he asked for from me was 377, renamed by factor. That is what I provided.</p>
<p>If he wanted 317, factor does not even remotely work on it. factor’s ruleset is written around a change that occured somewhere ~347 (it’s been a while). 317 is (unsurprisingly) very different from the later clients. Hacking up the rules should not at all be difficult, as quite a few would have no corresponding code in 317 and could simply be eliminated, but I’m certainly not going to be the one to do it.</p>
<p>If someone needs a copy of factor, I can provide it. I tend to only come to these forums by fluke or extreme boredom, so IRC is probably the easier place to find me. <a href="http://irc.eggsampler.com" rel="nofollow noopener">irc.eggsampler.com</a>, occasionally <a href="http://irc.efak.net" rel="nofollow noopener">irc.efak.net</a>.</p>
<p>Edit: Scratch that. A thread or two below this already contains a link for factor, and 317.</p>

              <p>The last before the switch to the new client was 377, not 317.  Or perhaps you meant the last version of factor succesfully renamed 317?  But I would like to have the 317 renamed by factor so I don’t have to do the work myself.  If someone could hook me up with that it would be great. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
