    <title>Another Stupid &#39;How do I learn Java?&#39; Topic by me</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/another-stupid-how-do-i-learn-java-topic-by-me/127863</link>
    <description>A good few months ago I bought that Java book. It helped to a certain extent. Just glancing at it now I only managed to get up to the chapter entitled &#39;Arranging Components on a User Interface&#39;. I see people like frank_, SL ect develop their skills very, very quickly. 

What I want to do with Java isn&#39;t to do anything related with RuneScape cheating, or RuneScape what-so-ever. I want to use Java to make programs that help people. Maybe Java isn&#39;t the correct language to be doing that in? Idk. If anyone can help me, it would be appreciated...</description>

[/quote]<br>
its bad that you have the idea that java is made for runescape[/quote]</p>
<p>I only said that because that is what the forum is based on. So normally people would think ‘he wants to learn about Java and how it is used to cheat RuneScape’.</p>

              <p>A good few months ago I bought that Java book. It helped to a certain extent. Just glancing at it now I only managed to get up to the chapter entitled ‘Arranging Components on a User Interface’. I see people like frank_, SL ect develop their skills very, very quickly.</p>
<p>What I want to do with Java isn’t to do anything related with RuneScape cheating, or RuneScape what-so-ever. I want to use Java to make programs that help people. Maybe Java isn’t the correct language to be doing that in? Idk. If anyone can help me, it would be appreciated…</p>
