    <description>Hey Guys, I have recently been noticing the lack of enjoyable private servers. Now no offense to the owners cause i do know what hard work you put in to the server. The problem is that they are ALL based in varrock, all have the same features, and all die out in about a week. So after joining and leaving about 15-20 servers I thought, Why not help out. So I will gladly code for some servers this week and next week in an attempt to raise the standard of Runescape Private Servers. I really dont want anything in return, maybe like a credits to- Hartman on the servers forum page but I really dont want an admin/mod or any amor/stats on the server. So dont post saying &quot;scammer&quot; or &quot;nice try noob&quot;...cause im basically editing a source i could find on the forums and i dont want anything in return but credits. So thats it. If your intersted please post below or PM me. In whatever way you contact me please include an AIM screen name, no-ip adress, hamachi network, ect. so i can contact you when needed. Also include your server name, source, and anything you have alredy done to the server.

NOTE: Please do NOT post here looking for help fixing an error. I wont do it. This is why you compile after every change..so you know where you messed up if you do!

About ME:

My name is max, im 14 about to turn 15 living in New York. I have been coding for about a year and a half so i know what im doing. Ive been involved in private servers for a pretty long time now. I just came back from about a month break. I was getting bored of mopar but i didnt want to end my involvement in it so i took a break. I have a runescape account...the name is Keyskeeper he is a level 87 with 85 mage and 70 mining. Hes got pretty good stats. My current goal is to rank all of his stats on high scores. So I would be glad to help any one needing coding help with their servers so post here or PM me!

Thanks, and best of luck!
