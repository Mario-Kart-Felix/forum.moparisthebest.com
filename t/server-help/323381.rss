    <description>Hello, well my old computer broke down and i had my own server and everything so i got a new computer. I read the post on how to setup a server and i did everything it said and i got into my router(linksys) and i went to the applications and gaming, then to port range forwarding, and then i added the start and end port(43594) and my ip. Then i saved it and enabled it and went to no-ip.com, made a ip and then downloaded it and checked my server name. So i went into my source, turned it on, went into the moparscape client, typed in my ip and it wouldnt work. I tried posting on the server thing and it said it couldnt be read. Does anyone know what is wrong?</description>

              <p>[quote=“imsokool22, post:3, topic:323381”]bigbig, did you add an exception to your firewsll on your pc? i see that you did on your router but if you want to use no-ip you have to port forward on your router and add an exception to your firewall on your pc. Do you have win 7?if ya do then ya’ll need utorrent to add an exception to your firewall[/quote] oh yes! I forgot about port 43594 usage. If you use windows xp go to start panel&gt; connect to&gt; all wireless connections&gt; right click on the connection that provides your Internet &gt; click properties&gt; then go to exceptions&gt; add port. Fill in 43594 for the port and it should be TCP if I’m not mistaken. This is from the top of my head, feel free to correct me.</p>

              <p>Did you type in the correct ip? Just making sure, invade you didn’t this is how. Go to start&gt;run&gt; type in cmd in the box and hit enter&gt;type ipconfig&gt; look there. It’ll show your ip address. And as for the server “thing”, what do you mean exactly?</p>
