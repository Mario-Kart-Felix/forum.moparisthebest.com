    <description>Hello, i am making a server,

there are a few things that i am stuck on and cant do,

1,i cant log into the server when i have changed all to my server ip,i have no-ip running client and server but it still wont let me log into the server , the serverip on the client and server has been changed to mine so has the port, can anyone help ?

2,i was wondering if there is any way of moving the home base on the server and how to move/add objects E.G bank to the home or other places.

3,when i have no- ip and my server running , and i try and add it to the server status page it says &quot;please put your server online&quot; what should i do ?

[b]Can somone please help me i have been trying to do this for ages :( [/b]
