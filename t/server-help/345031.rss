I need someone who can

Change floor textures

So if anyone can do this and would like to help, Leave a message here, Or PM me with some contact details to get a hold of you.

Thanks for looking.</description>

              <p>Lets PK sorry but you are breaking a rule…</p>
<p>[quote=“Stork, post:1, topic:173846”]Stuff you can’t do in this board:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make offensive posts. They’ll be removed, and you could be moderated.</li>
<li>Play the superiority game (to clarify, I’m talking about ‘My server is better than yours’, ‘You can’t code’, etc). This is an informative community, so posts should be helpful. Criticism is fine, just keep it constructive.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">3.	Recruit server teams. If you want to get a team together for working on a project, that’s great, but don’t make threads about it here.</span>
</li>
<li>Discuss: compile errors, basic java programming, compiling tools (i.e. ultimate batch compilers!). The first two can be fixed by visiting the Sun website and checking out the java tutorials, and the second can be fixed with apache ant (<a href="http://ant.apache.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://ant.apache.org/</a>)</li>
<li>Post c&amp;p tutorials. This board is for development, not copy &amp; pasting.</li>
<li>Discuss problems with particular servers, for example: “Why can’t I connect to <a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">google.com</a>?”, or “Why doesn’t Edge-PKz work?”. These questions should be made on the thread where the server is advertised, if there is one.</li>
<li>Make posts informing us how well your project is coming along. By that, I mean “List of stuff nearly done! Fletching: 20%, Bank withdrawing: 80%”, etc.</li>
<li>
<pre><code> Keep the drama out of this section.
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These guidelines can and probably will be updated. Make sure you familiarize yourself with them.<br>
Please also note that these are guidelines, not concrete rules, though straying from them will result in consequences, the severity of which is at the discretion of the moderation team.[/quote]</p>
