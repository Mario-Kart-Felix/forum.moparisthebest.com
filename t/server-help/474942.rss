    <description>Okay here is the list of the problems Im having atm:



1st Problem: 
  
  Well my agility course is acting very unusual, before you start training you can run perfectly fine having no problems, but once you start your training and you run over the log of course, after that you cannot run anymore and you just walk, like the running gets glitched, and possible way to fix that and that you can run the whole course without having problems ???

2nd Problem:

  Every time where fighting in the server against NPC&#39;s we have a problem with the npc&#39;s out of no where getting glitched and disappearing, then when one of us tele&#39;s boom the npc&#39;s come back, and possible way of that as well ???


3rd Problem:

  Every time we have GP in our Inventory and trade the cape guy, the client freezes them out, whats wrong with that ?

4th Problem:

  I have a Spec restore altar, and every time I have players run up to it to restore there spec, it says &quot;Please wait another 3minutes to restore your special&quot; so they wait and same results pop out and that table doesnt work, anyway how I can fix that ?

5th Problem:

  I have perfectly added Glacor Boots, and when I wear them, they look really glitchy and weird, and suggestion on how to fix those ?

Please be specific on where I should edit as in &quot;Server&quot; or &quot;Client&quot; Folders. Hopefully if we fix these issues, this can be a guide to help others, if there having the same issues.</description>

              <p>Your using an InsanityX or what ever it’s called Source. I can tell because of the 1st problem.</p>
<p>Presonally I would use another base. The server has like 100 bugs on every little thing and it’s just terriable.</p>
