    <description>Not really concerning a full server but say if i downloaded MoparScape with no server and i hit start server. And i dont got one. than when i start game does it load me a temp server? or does it save stuff after i log out.

cause if it does than what is the point of all the other servers?

and is there a good guide on how to learn to edit the items and npcs where they spawn, shops etc. basically all in-game material

Edit: Well i figured out that it does not save anything is there a way to do that? or do i just leave my player up all the time or how can i get it to work? or do i have to have a full server?
So since i do could some one post a stable server i dont care what version or what it has as long as it is stable and i can have some ablities to edit it as a noob</description>
