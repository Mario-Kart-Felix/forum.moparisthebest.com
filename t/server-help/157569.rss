              <p>the first image means that all the compiling is successfull, (DOUCHEBAG), and the second error might mean you have to go in the file “character” and erase your file, or you need to clear out our bank and inventory in your character file, or it could be this gay thing for homos called “silabsoft”.</p>

              <p>The first one just means that the server has been successfully compiled. For the other error i would try deleting your character from the character folder then sign back on to the server</p>
