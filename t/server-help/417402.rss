    <description>Hello,
I started a server a few days ago but when i log into it this happens in the run cmd thing,

Loaded worldmap in  &lt;47 ms&gt;...
Your server is now online.
connection from 127.0.0.1:5085
[client-1-myname]: loading process completed [Has powers, lag:2 ms]
[client-1-myname]: Invalid server: SpiritScapePkz.no-ip.biz

I think that&#39;s why my friends cant log on.
I can log on fine but when my friends try to log on it says &quot;error connecting to server&quot;
i know i portforwarded correctly i checked at canyouseeme.org
Any ideas?
I have my no-ip up and running for this host [port:43594]
Note: I made a webclient and one of my friends actually logged on. But it is very glitchy and i want my download client to work. please help.</description>
