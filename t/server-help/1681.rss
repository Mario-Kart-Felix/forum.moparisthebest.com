              <p>1.well i changed the health of the npc so i can attack it but it still freezes and it sasy in the ms-dos window that it timed out could it be because im spawning him in the middle of the game while im playing or do i have to add the npc i want to the autospawn.cfg?</p>
<p>2.when i add a npc to the autospawn.cfg does that mean that when i start the game up the npc or monster will spawn automatiicly everytime in the coordinates i out in?</p>
<p>3.if i have to do in what i put in #2^ will the monster respawn after a while or do i have to set that to?</p>
<p>4.my frineds files are in lowercase and its one word could it be the fact that im behind a router?[br][size=1]Posted at: April 21, 2006, 12:29:35 pm[/size][hr]<s><s>BUMP</s></s>~</p>

              <p>the monster problem is because the hp for the monster is set to 0 change it to a number as for the connecting problem make sure you have no CAPS in the file name and the user name password ect</p>
