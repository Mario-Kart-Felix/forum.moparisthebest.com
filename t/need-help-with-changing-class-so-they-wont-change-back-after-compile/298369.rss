    <title>Need help with Changing .CLASS so they won&#39;t change back after Compile</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-changing-class-so-they-wont-change-back-after-compile/298369</link>
    <description>Hello, I recently downloaded a Source and a Client off the Download section and the Client was a no-hassle to change to my likings, (Changing names like Vintage Pk to my Server), but on the Source whenever I login it has the log in message of the previous user. I used Z-File Searcher to fix this but every time I try changing it after I edit it to my likings and compile it goes back to it previous users log in message. FYI The files that are changing back are .CLASS files. Any help on how to make it so they won&#39;t change back will be appreciated. Thanks.</description>

              <p>Ask the person who released it how to change it, he probably knows since he coded it.<br>
I’m not really sure how to help you with that.</p>
