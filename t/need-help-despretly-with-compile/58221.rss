              <p>hmm i always got that error and i figured out how to fix it… what i did was just change the javac line to sumthin like this, idk the exact path i had it at…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">"c:\sun\...\...\javac.exe" *.java</code></pre>
<p>try that with ur compiler, just type in the path that javac is in, it shud be in a folder called bin or sumthin</p>
<p>or, my problem was that i had to define hte location of javac, this is the fix i ended up using… open control panel, system, advanced, enviromental variables there should be a variable called path in ur user list, just set it to ur javac location, like mine is “C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0\bin;C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.6.0\bin” i dont think u need the second one but i wanted to be sure it wud work</p>
