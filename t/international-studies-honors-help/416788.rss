    <description>We have to write a full block letter to an Ambassador of a country, so I chose China. I understand what I am going to say to him, but the full block letter part is rather confusing because so many things are optional and I don&#39;t really know what I actually need for the letter. Has someone ever done an assignment like this for school? Can you show me an example?

Thanks ;3
