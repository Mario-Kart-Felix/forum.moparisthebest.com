    <title>[Request] Need a forums Banner [Request]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/request-need-a-forums-banner-request/291331</link>
    <description>I&#39;m gonna be as specific as I possibly can.

I want a banner for my forums. I need It to say &quot;Fallout-Pkz&quot; without the quotes in it, with a decorative text. I&#39;d like it to not look gay though. The background, I&#39;d like a vengence skull, with the color set to negative, like were it&#39;s the opposite color of the real veng skull. Then a decorative background behind it, that matches the skull&#39;s color. I&#39;d like if it had a darker tone to it also.

If you can do this idea, please do. If you think you can do something better than this though, please do.

Thanks for the help.
