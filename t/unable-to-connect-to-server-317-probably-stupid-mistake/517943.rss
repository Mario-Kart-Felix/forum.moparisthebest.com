    <title>Unable To Connect to Server (317) (Probably Stupid Mistake)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unable-to-connect-to-server-317-probably-stupid-mistake/517943</link>
    <description>I recently got back to playing rsps, and thought on working on mine again. (so yes I&#39;m a newbie at coding but you gotta start somewhere) and i forgot the simple way to change the ip on a 317.
I went into the Server.java and Client.java and change all them ips and such and portforwarded, but still saying unable to connect to server. So either I screwed something up or I missed a step, but i wouldn&#39;t mind if someone would look at it for me, It should be an easy fix.
The Port Checker said the port was open so I don&#39;t understand what I&#39;m exactly doing wrong?

Thanks.</description>
