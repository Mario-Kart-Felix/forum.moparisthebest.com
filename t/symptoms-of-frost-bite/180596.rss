    <title>Symptoms of frost bite?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/symptoms-of-frost-bite/180596</link>
    <description>Hello.
I ran home today [just got home at 9:30 AM] because there was a fire/flood/school shooting. I was unable to get my coat out of my locker because they did not let us onto the 2nd floor. It is -25 with wind chill outside today, so I was wondering what the symptoms of frost bite are, because my legs are now very hot [and I&#39;m inside].
Thanks

Haha I don’t play RuneScape/MoparScape servers, although I don’t think they’re stupid games. And also the ears… mine were FREEZING I had to blow warm breath on my hands and rub my ears to keep them from being so cold.</p>

              <p>If you do get frost bite, remember to shoot that arm and post a pic of it on here. And frost bite will happen if you are in a cold area for too long of a time, you could get it fast by walking home, if it was like -40 but most likely no, getting frost bite from the wind won’t really happen, though you can get air cuts.</p>
<p>I had to do a real lock down once when a store across the street from my school was getting robbed; and my class room door couldn’t be locked (it was a room that your not ‘suppose’ to be in at all times.</p>

The school shooting was a joke at my school.<br>
What happened was someone pulled a fire alarm, for reasons no one knew. They put all of the kids in the corners of the building next to a quick exit door [it was too cold to go outside] and they later found out the pipes burst from the extremely low temperatures, flooding the atrium/athletic hallway. Some people had no idea what had happened, so many people started saying things such as “there was a school shooting!” “two teachers got shot!” “there was so much blood!”<br>

My school has a pretty good security system, no metal detectors or anything, but it is an expensive school [robbing some of us to the bone it seems…] and I don’t really think anyone would do that here.<br>

Wow… Where do you live? :O[/quote]<br>
Beverly Hills, Michigan. It was an exceptionally cold day, although our winter is kind of odd this time. We don’t always have snow this winter, although sometimes we do, and yesterday, it was in the negatives.</p>

When you go inside when you are freezing, you feel hot because of the great temperature difference and your body is rapidly gaining heat.[/quote]<br>
Oh okay, I was worried because the heat was mostly running where my veins/arteries.</p>

              <p>[quote=“cooper, post:1, topic:180596”]Hello.<br>
I ran home today [just got home at 9:30 AM] because there was a fire/flood/school shooting. I was unable to get my coat out of my locker because they did not let us onto the 2nd floor. It is -25 with wind chill outside today, so I was wondering what the symptoms of frost bite are, because my legs are now very hot [and I’m inside].<br>
Thanks<br>
