    <title>Need help with my 562 :/</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-my-562/438449</link>
    <description>You do not have to answer every question. They are just general annoyances that are pissing me off :)
Feel free to call me names. It makes me smile xD

Q: Whenever I spawn an item, it gives me two of that item. How do I stop this from occurring?

Q: How do you stop the usage of the in-game admin command console?

Q: How do I add objects into the game world? I.E.; Altars at spawn, giant phallus in bank, etc. etc.

Q: How do I make everyone that connects to my server able to spawn? (I have never worked with a 562, so i have no idea :P )

Q: Just what [i]is[/i] the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?

This may help others besides me, post some answers for the community and myself as well :)
