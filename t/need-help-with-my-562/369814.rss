    <title>Need Help With My 562</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-my-562/369814</link>
    <description>need assistance on coding a specific request.

The problem is, i have set the source to a eco, but the way the server has it is.
when you die, anywhere or by anything you don&#39;t lose. so having eco is pretty much useless.
i need help on changing it where you lose items on death.

my msn is itz_megan@live.com


will use Showmypc or Teamviewer

NEED HELP ASAP PLEASE</description>
