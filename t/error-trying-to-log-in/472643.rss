<p>Sk8er is your server online and how do you get other people to play on it ? Did you make it into a .jar file ? Also I figured out the main problem causing me from logging in, okay when im not running DUC (No-Ip) and uTorrent (Portfowarding), I log in, but when I do have those files open and running, it gives me that prompt on the loggin in screen “blah blah try using a different world”. Do you know whats causing that ?<br>

I didn’t know you could jar a server. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
They might be conflicting. Or you just don’t know how to port forward with utorrent correctly.<br>
I suggest trying this:<br>

This is how I used to run servers on utorrent:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run the DUC</li>
<li>Open utorrent, set it’s port to anything NOT 43594.</li>
<li>Run server.</li>
<li>Change utorrent’s port back to 43594</li>
<li>Close server</li>
<li>Run server<br>
Go ahead and try that if you’d like.[/quote]</li>
</ol>
<p>Alright well before I try all these steps I wanna start off by saying, everytime Im portfowarding on utorrent and when I try to log in, it gives my that error, but when I close utorrent it lets me log in, and also Im trying to get my friends to connect and they get to the log in and it says “Error Connecting To Server”, also everytime I go on <a href="http://canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.org</a> to see if port is running good, it says Error and that it isnt, but the server is running great on my side, any suggestions ?</p>
<p>And for some reason I think my dumbass computer doesnt wanna cooperate with me in the portfowarding for my friends to go, so when portfoward works, does that mean my friends can go on my server ?</p>

<p>I suggest that you dont use pvpscape because 10% armour is updated and the rest is not so like bandos tasset isnt updated and chestplate is…If you want to continue just post and i will give u some steps…p.s noone will spoonfeed you on this forums so dont ask for skype or t.v</p>

<p>Okay, then what do you suggest me to use ? I wanna hear it from your side, I really like TrisidiaX’s source/client because of the items, no other server have I found thats 317 with items like this … whats your suggestion ??? &amp; True, that does make you a lot better.</p>

Hey. Dude, Gushers. STOP telling him what source to use. Let the guy figure it out.<br>
Oh, and as for that spoonfeed comment. No, we won’t. But we do push you to the right direction instead of off a cliff.[/quote]</p>
<p>And sk8er you’ve been helping me the most, I really appreciate it, thanks man! Do you have any suggestions on what may be causing this ? Ive deleted cache a million times and restarted like that, also I have deleted the client and tried like that, still has worked, and I havent changed anything except JDK’s and No-Ips, thats just about it.</p>
