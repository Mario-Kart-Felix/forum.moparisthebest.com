The software industry claims that worldwide, software piracy is a growing, $11-billion-a-year business.It can be that kind of money which has Microsoft scared, due to the fact those huge income is attracting an old criminal foe. Organized crime is finding that dealing in counterfeit Microsoft now is easier than dealing in medicines.&quot;In the last six months, we now have begun to see excellent counterfeit software created in Colombia, just outside of Bogota,Inch says Brad Smith, who heads Microsoft&#39;s anti-piracy efforts. The company is actually hoping that brand-new, harder-to-copy CDs with holographs can at least slow the problem.
