    <title>(moparclassic) How do i make persistenceauth work with serializedstoragemedium</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparclassic-how-do-i-make-persistenceauth-work-with-serializedstoragemedium/522874</link>
    <description>hey guys so this is the thing i am trying to do and if i can get help to successfully make it work it will be much appreciated.
-- what i would like to do is make characters like it is in easyrsc with the files for players. --
what i think i need is persistenceauth and serializedstoragemedium to do this? 
If you use dummyauth and serializedstoragemedium you can do this but it does not check to see the password matches the one saved in the player file(example when you log in you can use any password to log into a character made). 
--I need to Implement so it checks the password aswell so it checks the character files password for the character and will only log in if the correct password is matched.
     Can someone please tell me how i would do this and maybe just paste here what i need and where i have to put it</description>
