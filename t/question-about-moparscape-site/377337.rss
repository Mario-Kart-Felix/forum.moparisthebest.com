    <title>Question about Moparscape site</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-about-moparscape-site/377337</link>
    <description>Well I can&#39;t seem to find a suggestion section. 

So I&#39;m going to ask this in a question :P

1.) Why can&#39;t we allow people to see how many posts we have posted? (this would be a nice feature for the site)

2.) Why does our Rep++ have to limit to 200, why not infinite or 10,000 or something high like that?

Thanks. :o</description>

<p>That wouldn’t make it hard to get rep.  Long ago, it was 1 rep for 1 rep++, and it was even more out of control than it is now. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

People pretty much answered your questions, but I’ll go ahead and do it too:</p>
<ol>
<li>We don’t care about post count here, and believe it doesn’t matter.  If you really want to see your post count, you can do so on your profile.</li>
<li>We also don’t believe rep means all that much.  Plus the system is set up in such a way that you give 1 rep point for every 15 points you have yourself, this means that, with a cap of 200, the most anyone can give is 13 points, which is a lot.  If the cap is removed it would be possible for someone with thousands of rep to give someone else hundreds in just one click.  So it would mean even less than it does now.</li>
<li>Avatars and signatures make the forum look messy and childish, and are also a nightmare when it comes to moderation.  We just don’t like them here.</li>
</ol>
<p>What we DO think means a lot here is the quality (not quantity) of your posts, and how helpful you are to others.  In fact, those are about the only things that matter.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Why cant members have avatars? Who cares if theres Tits and Vaginas and Penises and Anuses, its what that person likes and if their avatar is that they will be percieved as a sick mother fucker Lol</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Ontopic</span> Waste of Topic, should be locked you got your answer[/quote]</p>
<p>Because most people who are apart of this forum are under age this isn’t a porn site, if you want porn then go to R-S or other community that allows people to have it in their avatars and sigs…</p>

<p>Its nice to have though isn’t it?</p>
<p>And the posts let you keep track easyer, if they could maybe</p>
<p>You selected what posts people may view on your profile and it could say:</p>
 
<p>Posts In: Server Help<br>
345<br>
Posts In: Server Downloads<br>
231<br>
Rep:<br>
95</p>
<p>And you  choose what people may view, max is 4. Or something.</p>
<p>Also why can’t we have avatars?</p>

<p>Post count is looked upon as something that doesn’t matter. As seen with rep, it would only cause problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It used to be that way until silabsoft passed a a few thousand I believe. Eventually it was just set to 200 to attempt to stop problems/uncontrollable rep.</p>

<p>1 - People spam for post count.</p>
<p>2 - People rep their ‘friends’ or offer ‘rep4rep’ to get it higher, hence the reason you can’t rep others until you have a reputation of 15 or higher yourself.</p>
<p>No problem. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Well I can’t seem to find a suggestion section.</p>
<p>So I’m going to ask this in a question <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>1.) Why can’t we allow people to see how many posts we have posted? (this would be a nice feature for the site)</p>
<p>2.) Why does our Rep++ have to limit to 200, why not infinite or 10,000 or something high like that?</p>
<p>Thanks. :o</p>
