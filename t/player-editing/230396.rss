    <description>ok i just got the deltascape client and source. i got it online but i was wondering how to change exp rate add items into shops and what your starter is. I thought it would be in the Player notepad but Ive looked about 7 times the exp rate is currently 120 so ive gone through many files and only 1 i think would have the exp rate. my msn is bryson129@hotmail.com add me and let me know if u know how to do this or just post here, thanks

also how do i add commands and remove them too? and p ring every1 knows about the 1hit ring for mods and admins how do i create that so they stats is like a 1000 str bonus? they ring isn&#39;t even edited into the game well the stats that i want it to give</description>
