              <p>I personally don’t know, but im going to be buying a sponsorship soon, its a matter of if people like your server, moparscape can guarantee that there will be people coming online, but The actual question is, is your server good enough to keep them logged in?</p>

<p>yes, the sponsored advertisement, in my opinion, is completely worth it. usually servers go from 10-15 on average amounts of active members, to 40-60.</p>

</aside>
<p>That should pretty much explain if it is worth or not.</p>
<p>Personally, the best way to really get invovled possibly is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Affiliating with other servers <em>they advertise on your site, you advertise on theirs you share the community</em>
</li>
<li>Youtube vids</li>
<li>Advertising on chat boxes on top sites</li>
<li>Advertising on other servers &lt;- Please don’t do this.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to pay for it, give it a shot but it is no guarantee.</p>
<p>And tbh in my OWN personal opinion, RS servers are pretty dead population wise. You may get a handy few people but, it don’t seem quiet as active as it was when Silab’s Client was God back in the day.</p>
