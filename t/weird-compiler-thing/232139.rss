    <description>alright well YES i have jdk, and stuff, and the compiler does &quot;techinclly&quot; work.
thing is it doesnt. i have over 2 months now of coding, the really needs to be put to life.
the compiler doesnt do its job with the client.java file. i tird a bunch of diffrent compilers so far what i have is that looks like it works is

[code]@echo off
title Easy Compiler V1
echo Please Wait...
if exist &quot;%programfiles%\Java&quot; (call :compile &quot;%programfiles%\Java\&quot;)
:compile
for /D %%x in (&quot;%~1jdk*&quot;) do (set p=&quot;%%~x\bin\javac.exe&quot;)
if defined p (%p% -cp . *.java)
if defined p (goto end)
:end
pause
exit[/code]
