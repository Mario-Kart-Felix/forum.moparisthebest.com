          <blockquote>
              <p>For the gangplank/door, the gangplank needs to have a case. What ever the ID is.</p>
<p><code>case ####:
</code><br>
Then it needs a tele command. You can add an if statement, or just a tele. find the coordinates on the boat, and add them here.</p>
<p><code>case ####:
         teleportToX = ####;
         teleportToY = ####;
         sendMessage("You board the ship.");</code></p>
<p>now with an if statement, such as if you have to be a certain level.</p>
<p>[code]case ###<span class="hashtag">#:</span></p>
<p>if(playerLevel[0] &gt;= 80)<br>
{<br>
teleportToX = ####;<br>
teleportToY = ####;<br>
sendMessage(“You board the ship.”);<br>
}<br>
else<br>
{<br>
sendMessage(“You need 80 attack to board.”);<br>
}[/code]</p>
<p>For the doors, you are going to need to use something similar to this.</p>
<p><code>if ((objectX == 3231 &amp;&amp; objectY == 3433)) {
						face = -3; //South</code><br>
that tells it which way to face. now add a case for the door ID:</p>
<p><code>case ####
          face = //0 for west, -1 for north, -2 for east, -3 for south (the direction you want it to face after being opened)</code></p>
<p>And sorry, I have no clue on deleting globals.</p>
