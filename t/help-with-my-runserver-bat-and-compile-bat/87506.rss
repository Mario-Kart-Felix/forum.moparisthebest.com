    <title>Help with my runserver.bat and compile.bat</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-my-runserver-bat-and-compile-bat/87506</link>
    <description>I need some serious help please, not just a few words, someone who is willing to go into detail. I am using the &#39;Only The Best&#39; server, and have downloaded the files from that.

This is what it says when I edit my compile.bat:

To see what mine is, go here http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,77972.0.html then look towards the code near the end of the first post.


This is what my runserver.bat&#39;s edit looks like:

@echo off
color 0a
title Run
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_01\bin\java&quot; client
pause


If you spot anything wrong with them, please tell me!

When I want to compile my server, nothing happens, just a flash underscore appears.

When I want to run my server, I get this:


Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: client
Press any key to continue...


What&#39;s happening here?  :|


---

Also, 

I can&#39;t find my javac.exe file. The only thing near to it is things like javacpl.exe or javacp.exe.

When I try to log into the server, I get:

Error connecting to server. Must be down.
Click &quot;Cancel&quot; then &quot;Start Server&quot; to make your own.

I just need help because there&#39;s so many errors around.</description>
