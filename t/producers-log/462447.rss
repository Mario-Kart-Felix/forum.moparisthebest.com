    <title>Producer&#39;s Log</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/producers-log/462447</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been producing a Hip-Hop Mixtape and EP with a friend of mine, and decided to make a log of what I did while cleaning up a vocal for one of the songs.
His recording setup is rather undesirable (cheap microphone with no pop filter or shock mount, no pre-amp, poor room / background noise, etc), so it definitely needed to be processed.

The DAW I use is Ableton Live, and the VSTs I used in this particular project are FabFilter Pro-L, Pro-Q, Pro-C (limiter, EQ, compressor), and Waves X-Noise, DeEsser (noise reduction, de-esser).

[code]Log of steps of processing performed on the vocals for the &#39;jigga&#39; track.
Start time: 3:40pm. End time: 6:18pm.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Created a new Live set specifically for processing this vocal.
    * Although unnecessary, project BPM was set to 86.0.
2.  Added vocal to a new audio track (A).
    - Disabled warping.
    - Added a Utility and set Width to 0%.
3.  Created another audio track (B) and resampled the (now mono) vocal.
    * Most likely an unnecessary step, but I&#39;m trying to introduce as many restoration points as possible.
4.  Opened resampled track in Audacity.
    * This audio is now technically mono, but the file is still stereo.
    - Selected &#39;Tracks -&gt; Stereo Track to Mono&#39;
    - Exported 16-bit WAV.
5.  Added true mono vocal to a new track (C).
    * Tracks created for previous steps have been muted.
    * Note that creating a true mono file at this point in the process is likely useless, but there are no downsides (especially considering the vocal will ultimately be mono anyway).
    - Disabled warping.
6.  Added FabFilter Pro-L to the current track (C).
    + Set Style to Transparent.
    + Set Attack to 0.0ms.
    + Set Lookahead to 3.0ms.
    * Output Level is kept at 0dB.
    * One of the quietest spoken words peaks at approximately -11dB.
    - Starting with Gain at +7.50dB.
    - Most areas are now between -4dB and -10dB with 0dB gain reduction.
      * Loudest areas undergo between -1dB and -3dB of gain reduction.
      - Extraneous transients (pops) undergo between -6dB and -9dB of gain reduction.
7.  Resampled vocal onto a new track (D).
    * Track C has been muted.
    - Quick visual observation shows that the overall volume is much more consistent (i.e. close to 0dB).
    - Noise is quite loud during spoken areas.
      - Backtracking to previous track (C) and experimenting with noise reduction.
8.  Added Waves X-Noise (Mono) (before FabFilter Pro-L in the effect chain) to track C (now unmuted).
    * Track D has been muted.
    * Temporarily disabled FabFilter Pro-L.
    * Set Resolution to High.
    - Learned noise profile from first 8 bars (approximate) of vocal.
    - After experimentation, parameters have been set as follows:
      + Threshold: 33.2dB
      + Reduction: 64.0dB
      + Attack: 0ms
      + Release: 70ms
    - A/B of with/without X-Noise applied shows an impressive level of noise reduction, resulting in a much cleaner vocal.
9.  Re-enabled FabFilter Pro-L.
    - Noise is still audible, but much less apparent (more of a mid-high rumble, compared to a hiss).
      * Expecting noise to be mostly unnoticeable when mixed down alongside of the beat.
10. Resampled noise reduced / limited vocal to new track (E).
    * Track C has been muted.
11. Added FabFilter Pro-Q to track.
    + Band 1: Low Cut (24dB/oct): 101Hz, Q: 0.671
12. Added Waves DeEsser (Mono) to track E.
    * Loaded Male Ess preset as a starting point.
    - After experimentation, parameters have been set as follows:
      + Audio Type: Split
      + Frequency: 7857Hz
      + Sidechain Mode: Band Pass
      + Threshold: -39.8dB
13. Added second FabFilter Pro-Q to track E.
    * Both Pro-Q instances can probably be combined into one and inserted after the DeEsser, however reducing the low-end rumble prior to de-essing seemed like a good idea.
    + Band 1: High Shelf: 1501Hz, +0.72dB, Q: 1.000
    + Band 2: High Cut (24dB/oct): 15194Hz, Q: 1.309
14. Resampled equalized/de-essed vocal to new track (F).
    * Track E has been muted.
    * Warping has been kept enabled to allow for use of automation.
    - Volume Envelope automation:
      + Set level to 0% for all sections of total silence.
      + &quot;Yeah&quot;: Applied gentle fade around beginning/end of word.
      + &quot;There&#39;s a new sheriff in town&quot;: Applied gentle fade around beginning/end of phrase to eliminate pops.
      + &quot;Yeah with the new sound&quot;: Applied gentle fade at beginning of phrase and silenced extraneous noise afterwards.
      + &quot;Got my man Ndroyd to back me up&quot;: Applied gentle fade around beginning/end of phrase.
      + &quot;What you have here are the words of a boss jigga&quot;: Applied gentle fade to begging of phrase.
      + &quot;I&#39;m pumpin&#39; out lines faster than y&#39;all can pull your trigger&quot;: Applied gentle fade to end of phrase and a gradual fade to the following inhale.
      + &quot;I don&#39;t wanna rape you but I gotta&quot;: Reduced volume of inhale after this phrase by approximately 25% with a gentle fade on either side.
      + &quot;It&#39;s a fact, we display the skills that you lack&quot;: Reduced volume of inhale after this phrase by approximately 30% with a gentle fade at the beginning and an abrupt fade at the end to reduce harshness of the following word.
      + &quot;That&#39;s Artifact&quot;: Reduced volume of inhale after this phrase by approximately 20% with a gentle fade on either side.
      + Applied a moderately abrupt fade at the end of the final word.
15. Added FabFilter Pro-C to current track (F).
    - After experimentation and some visual aid of s(M)exoscope, parameters have been set as follows:
      + Style: Clean
      + Knee: Hard
      + Input Level: +0.81dB
      + Threshold: -6.029dB
      + Ratio: 5.28:1
      + Attack: 0.58ms
      + Release: 133.1ms
      + Auto Gain: Disabled
      + Output Level: 0dB
      + Dry Level: -INFdB
    * This vocal had quite a large dynamic range to begin with (which was only slightly reduced after step 6), so unsurprisingly this level of compression does not negatively alter the sound.
16. Listened through entire vocal attentively multiple times to ensure quality.
    - Some minor tweaks were applied to the Volume Envelope automation performed in step 14.
17. Exported final processed vocal with the following settings:
    + Normalize: Off
    + Convert to Mono: On
    + Bit Depth: 24
    + Dither Options: Triangular[/code]

I&#39;ll provide links to the vocal before and after processing at some point (probably after we release it), but for now I&#39;m just posting the log.


If people find this kind of thing interesting, I&#39;d be willing to keep posting these for other projects as well.</description>

              <p>I’m pretty sure it’s not a stereo microphone, but I was trying to keep the vocal entirely mono (yeah, I was probably a bit excessive on emphasizing that during processing).<br>
After thinking about it a bit, I really could have just ignored it entirely and bounced the final vocal as mono and there would be no difference, but I suppose it didn’t hurt anything…</p>
