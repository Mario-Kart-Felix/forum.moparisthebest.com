    <title>Players Can&#39;t see other Players sometimes (Iclarity)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/players-cant-see-other-players-sometimes-iclarity/427011</link>
    <description>Hello there. I&#39;ve recently came across a bug during testing in my server and it appears (usually when someone uses a portal teleport) some players cannot see other players unless they log out and log back in. This can become annoying in PVP as a player will appear to be attacked by what looks like nothing. Giving them an advantage, does anyone know how to go about fixing this bug? some assistance would be greatly appreciated. 


- Thankyou</description>
