    <title>Looking for development team for OldTime Pk</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-development-team-for-oldtime-pk/383523</link>
    <description>Hello everyone! I am looking for a development team to help me create an almost perfect remake of the old runescape pking and maybe a few skills here and there.

What I am looking for is people who know how to code and work with many different types of servers.

Knowing javascript would be nice but I do not know javascript atm. If it is required at some point I shall try to take a few weeks to learn or longer.

I am mostly hoping for a 317 server but with many features.

This server will be paid for if needed by me but I do not expect to pay for anything because I will have a team to help me create everything ourselves. 

Previous Servers Owned : DruiD-Pkerz , Jason-Scape and a couple more but not important.

Knowledge of coding : Been playing rsps for years and years and have studied coding on mostly 317 and 508. I know how to pretty much add anything from object, items, specs to pk zones, ranks, websites and few more.

If you are interested please contact me on skype so we can actually talk to eachother.

Development team will be the owners also don&#39;t worry and will get full credit.

 Skype Name : MageOnUr-azz
Full Name : Jason Miller

This is my first time having a Topic on development team so please don&#39;t flame me about more info. If you want more information talk to me in skype -.-

Thanks! Hope to see someone help me!</description>

              <p>How about improving the layout? Making it look like you generally care? Creating headings and sub headings with detailed information. Because right now this looks like an unreadable mess which lacks detail.</p>
<p>I don’t think people should have to go through adding you on Skype just to get the bare information. First time or not, you should still improve it.</p>
