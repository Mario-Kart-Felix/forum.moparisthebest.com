    <description>First of all, look me in the eye and tell me thats not a bad-ass name.  :|

Okay so i know i got a problem with handles/hilts. If you criticise the handle, give me a suggestion about it. Dont just say it sucks please

              <p>Wow, that’s pretty nice. I haven’t been on the forums in weeks and you’ve already improved quite a bit. I wish I could make something like this but I haven’t been modeling for a while either, although I think I’ll start up again.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: July 01, 2009, 11:08:43 pm[/size][hr]Holy crap! I just realized that I’ve seen this sword before. I was actually going to try to model it a while back.<br>

I did model the one on the far right and the blade was perfect but the handle turned out crap.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

              <p>[quote=“dylan_0789, post:7, topic:286109”]alright, heres what i have to say (dw i decided to cut you some slack):</p>
<ol>
<li>handle is a little short and pretty thin.</li>
<li>The handle-blade connection doesnt look right.</li>
<li>is that supposed to be a wood handle? change it, or make it noticeably wood.</li>
<li>try fixing the hilt. its too obviously traced. i can see ripples in the hilt from the “create” tool.</li>
<li>The blade seems pretty thick(not wide) to be a sword, unless for a two-handed</li>
<li>why is there only a blue edge on the tip? is the rest of the sword blunt?</li>
<li>look at the tip in the 2nd to last pic, am i the only one who see’s the jagged part towards the bottom of the pic?</li>
</ol>
<p>i think ill stop there. Half that stuff i cant blame on you, like the ripples. Metasequoia is choppy and has a horrible trace function. the “Create” tool is terrible for getting what you want.<br>
Tip: Double check that there arent multiple verticies in one spot and that the edges line up properly as i can see a few areas where they dont.<br>
Dont take this as being an ass. im simply trying to mould you into a great modeller. if i go too easy on you, i cant help you.[/quote]</p>
<p>Here is what i got to say <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<ol>
<li>i spent 18 seconds on the handle, i’ll try harder next time <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">
</li>
<li>Its just a primitive stuck into the end of a blade, so i’ll give you that one.</li>
<li>yeah you can see the wood texture if you look real close</li>
<li>what hilt…? and the ripples are a part of the texture i used. its not a mistake. if you wanna see the model without ripply texture i can post a picture</li>
<li>I guess i can make it a 2h sword <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> that would look loads better actually</li>
<li>the blue edge on the tip is just an added decoration, its as sharp as the rest of te blade.</li>
<li>Yeah i didn’t notice that. I’ll fix that too <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">
</li>
</ol>
<p>The ripples arn’t meta’s fault. They are mine. its a texture. I’ll take off if it makes it look better. The create tool isnt as bad as you say it is mr. primitive <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>I’ll make a v2 and fix all the things you said. give me a few minutes [br][br][size=1]Posted on: June 29, 2009, 03:53:52 pm[/size][hr][quote=“CoonHunter, post:2, topic:286109”]0.0 , mind revealing how u got that nice twist into the handle?[/quote]<br>
The twist tool. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> play around with it and it can actually do wonders. Obviously i didnt do much with it here but it is actually a pretty amazing tool if you do a lot of primitive designs</p>
