    <title>Ffs, creating shops?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ffs-creating-shops/264162</link>
    <description>Could someone help me please(yet again...) :|
I want to make a staff shop, so I&#39;ve put in the tele ::staffzone, spawned a npc (sigmund the merchant) created a shop (Shop id = 71) and the items. Then I went to Client.Java and added this:
[code]
            } else if (NPCID == 1285) { // Staff Shop
                PutNPCCoords = true;
                WanneShop = 71; // Staff Shop
 [/code]

now, how am I going to make this shop work? Like, what do I have to do so people can actually trade him?
