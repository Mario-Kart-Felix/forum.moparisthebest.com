    <description>Hey im not sure if this is the right section for this, sorry if it isnt, im new to html and all that website coding, i have a vote popup reminding my players on my server to vote and it seems to have a timer or something, it only shows up first visit, its been about 15 hours and it hasnt showed up again.
heres a small code, what i want to know is how can i make it show up every time the page loads (home page)
Any help is really appreciated!!

[code]function createCookie(name,value,min) {
	if (min) {
		var date = new Date();
		date.setTime(date.getTime()+(min*60*1000));
		var expires = &quot;; expires=&quot;+date.toGMTString();
	}
	else var expires = &quot;&quot;;
	document.cookie = name+&quot;=&quot;+value+expires+&quot;; path=/&quot;;
}[/code]</description>
