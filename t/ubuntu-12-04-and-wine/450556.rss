    <title>Ubuntu 12.04 and WINE :(</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ubuntu-12-04-and-wine/450556</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve had to revert to my Ubuntu OS on my computer. No I&#39;m not bashing Linux, I actually believe linux is better then windows, but the support and cross platform gaming(etc..) isn&#39;t. I like to use photoshop, Flash Pro, and a few other Windows Based programs. I have also installed the newest version of WINE onto my computer. Now I try to install Photoshop CS5.1 Extended edition (as I HATE CS6 with a deadly passion), and i get unexpected error -0 (because -0 is TOTALLY possible). And it asks for a computer restart. It does this every time even after the restart. The same goes for Flash Pro.
I&#39;m also a  person that enjoys IMVU (don&#39;t care if you hash me for it) as their 3D graphics are unique and they implement self made products through programs like blender. The only currently working version of this is 453.0. Now, 453 isn&#39;t supported by IMVU and they force you to update or else you don&#39;t play. V474.0 doesn&#39;t work what so ever. It attempts to load and log me in. and freezes. Suggestions?

TL;DR: How do i get Adobe Flash Pro, Photoshop, and IMVU V474 to work on Ubuntu 12.04 using WINE 1.5

Thank you.

<p>Photoshop itself works but the installer does not, the only way to get it to work on Ubuntu 12.04 is to manually copy the program files and registry entries. That is probably not possible in your case.</p>
<p>The next best thing is to [quote=“t4, post:2, topic:450556”]find alternatives[/quote]</p>
