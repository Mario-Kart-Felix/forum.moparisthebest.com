    <title>Npc hit Through prayer? 718</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-hit-through-prayer-718/520268</link>
    <description>I was wondering how i could change an npc to hit through prayer, atm i have an npc i use as a boss (ballak) And Players can camp at him for hours on end, i even made his stats very op and his health very large but people still just sit there and beat him, i have tried to search around and see however since i added ballak without any special attacks or sounds i dont have an npc file for him (Ballak.java) i was thinking about just creating one however if i do so how would i change it so he can hit through prayer, or even if there is a simplier way for me to this? thanks

Edit: i have made a ballakthepummeller.java and when i looked around for a file i could use, i came across lucien, however lucien also has a luciencombat.java how would i go about makeing one work for ballak?</description>
