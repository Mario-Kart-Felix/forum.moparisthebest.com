    <title>Rsps logging in issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsps-logging-in-issue/436998</link>
    <description>Hello, I went on Matrix rsps yesterday then went back on mine and now when i log into my rsps it doesn&#39;t work. I log in and it says welcome to the game in the chat box and i can see the different options like armor, inventory, etc. but the screen where my character would be stays black and wont load. I&#39;ve uninstalled and re-installed java and re downloaded the cache but it still doesnt work. I even reinstalled java and such. Is there a specific java that i need for rsps webclient running? I even tried dl client. Same thing. I got a Java SE binary has stopped working error and thats why i ran virus scan then reinstalled java again. I was wondering if anyone could help me that has experienced a problem like this! I&#39;ve been on rsps&#39;s for 5 years and never gone through an error or issue such as this. THANK YOU!</description>

              <p>To me it sounds like it could be an error with a model perhaps a custom model that cannot be read or isn’t properly added? have you tried a diffrent client?</p>
