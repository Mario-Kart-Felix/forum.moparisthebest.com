    <title>Why I Hated Skyfall</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-i-hated-skyfall/470921</link>
    <description>I felt absolute disappointment when leaving the cinema tonight. I expected to be presented with a bond that was just about complete with his transition to what he should be. The initial Casino Royale Bond revamp set the path rather nicely, exploring a little of his past but still providing us with mystery. He was the new Bond. What did Skyfall do? Threw him back to the beginning, making any character development from the previous two wasted.

Here are the the reasons for my disappointment:

[ul][li]Where was the wit? I understand that this version of Bond was supposed to be a lot more cold and based around action. However, this become lost when his vulnerabilities were constantly brought up throughout the movie. Casino at least provided balance.[/li]
[li]Why was his age brought up so often? We&#39;re only three bloody movies in. It almost felt like they were trying to kill him off. After seeing Quantum, it felt like we had only started seeing the beginning. Why has the end come so fast? [/li]  
[li]Moneypenny is black. Seriously? I&#39;m not a racist but it feels like this was just thrown in for the sake of being politically correct. A while female character appeals to the audience a lot more because that&#39;s what we grew up with. As well as this, most viewers are white. It makes sense to have a reoccurring character appeal to the main audience. Moneypenny had that English private schoolgirl feel, which now appears to be lost forever. Chemistry? None. [/li]
[li]If Skyfall was split into three, I would burn the script of the third. It went for way too long and made so little sense. Why could backup not be called at the last second?[/li]
[li]The villain&#39;s acting was great. However, it rarely got a chance to be shown. Two main scenes were the only opportunity. Also, please inform me of why he had to be captured and we spent about half an hour watching a tunnel chase when he already knew M&#39;s location?[/li]
[li]No mystery. Adding Sean Connery as the ground keeper would have been an excellent choice, just to stir up the possibility of Bond still only being a codename. That sort of teasing allows the imagination to roam.[/li]
[li]Bond girl? Sure, there was one. For 5 minutes.[/li][/ul]



I have a few more but I&#39;ll try contain my need to rant on. 
I understand the approach that they wanted to take with this one but sadly, it just doesn&#39;t fit Bond.</description>

I agree, the money wasn’t what I was expecting. Casino Royal and Quanum of Solace &gt; Skyfall. By a lot…<br>

What were you expecting though? My family was excited for a classic Bond movie. If you haven’t seen the other Bonds I can see why ratings would be up.[/quote]</p>
<p>A good action filled movie, where bond gets himself out of trouble, makes funny jokes, and kicks ass.</p>
<p>The villain was really good, but I feel like it just wasn’t the Bond I’m used to watching</p>

              <p>I haven’t watched Skyfall (yet) so I skimped over a lot of your criticisms in avoiding any spoilers, but to say that Skyfall doesn’t fit Bond: are we talking about the films or the books? The general consensus with all the Daniel Craig films so far is that they aren’t Bond films in the sense they’re more about what the Bond is like in the books, more gritty and realistic than what the films portray.</p>
<p>The only people who seem to be disappointed by the films from what I can see are people like KroniKz_ who were expecting a, and I quote,  a “classic Bond movie” which there would be no reason to expect Skyfall to be if they had watched Casino Royal or Quantum of Solace.</p>
