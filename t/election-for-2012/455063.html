        <p>I believe, that if I were able to vote, I would vote for Romney. For several reasons, too.<br>
First of all, Obama is just a sweet-talker. He sugar coats everything and just makes people believe that what he says is true by the way he says things. I honestly don’t think he’s doing as much as he’s capable of doing in office. He says one thing and then does another, then talks about it claiming he never said that. For instance: On the O’Riley Factor, when Obama was campaigning for President the first time, him and Bill were discussing Capital Gains Tax. For those of you that don’t know what that is, it’s the profit you make from a sale of property of an investment. For example, when some people make money, they sometimes invest in other people, companies, businesses, and or things that, well, can be invested in. What people don’t know is that that is a completely different tax from Capital Income Tax, which is the tax on your income, or how much you earn. So there are taxes on investing and taxes on earning. Anyway, just so you understood. So, when Bill and Obama were discussing Capital Gain Tax, he mentioned raising it. Now most people think, okay, just tax the rich so they pay more. They think they’re taxing their INCOME, not who/what they’re INVESTING in. Anyway, so Bill called him out on it saying. “You’re gonna raise it to 30%?!” and Obama replied, “No, no, I never mentioned raising it to 30%” Implying that was too high of a tax. Now, about a year or so ago, maybe a couple months, he addressed the nation suggesting an increase to a 30% Capital Gain Tax. Now, our current tax percent for Capital Income is 35%, and for Capital Gains, it’s 15%. So if we raised that even more, the risk of investing in other people/things will not be worth it and blahblahblah, small businesses will fail (like they are doing right now) and we will start to become a country run by only large businesses which is bad because private/small businesses help our country with jobs, keeping competition so that there aren’t monopolies, etc. I could go into more detail and such but the point it, he DOESN’T KEEP HIS WORD. and I mean, sure. people change their minds and stuff and that’s okay. The point is that he gets so offended and sure that “No, that’s not going to happen” then just completely turns around and decides the opposite is what worries me. He could just say something like “Oh, we’re unsure right now” and provide more detail, etc. Anyway, this hasn’t just happened once, it’s just a solid example. Okay, wow so secondly… ObamaCare. I know this is a touchy subject so I’m just gonna say it out, straight. I’m pretty sure it’s violating our constitution, “Distributing the wealth” won’t do anything once he’s spent everyone else’s money, our country can’t afford any more debt, and it IS a problem. The bill is too socialist, I believe we need to be more conservative during this time with other countries going under such as Greece, ObamaCare: sure, it gives out free healthcare to everyone. Great. Who’s money is that coming from? Middle class. And the middle class is being taxed and taken from way too much, soon we’ll have a huge social class gap between wealthy and poor. Also, with ObamaCare, we will have a healthcare system like Canada, and many doctors will quit (my doctor is quitting) now that the government will pay them. (I’m pretty sure that they all get paid the same, not a hundred percent sure, and here’s some information on how our income tax will look now: <a href="http://www.smartmoney.com/taxes/inco...1335896160486/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.smartmoney.com/taxes/inco...1335896160486/</a> Check it out if you wanna, but in short, Medicare tax will increase on Self-Employment income if you make more than $200,000 a year, for married couple ajoined if you make over $250,000, etc. More on the page, but the main things are that the maximum rate on dividends on long-term gains for people that invest is going to go from 15% to 39.6%! Quoting: “But that’s not all. Also starting in 2013, all or part of the net investment income, including long-term capital gains and dividends, collected by higher-income folks can get socked with an additional 3.8% “Medicare contribution tax.” Therefore, the maximum federal rate on long-term gains for 2013 and beyond will actually be 23.8% (versus the current 15%) and the maximum rate on dividends will be a whopping 43.4% (versus the current 15%). Yikes!” Like. Seriously? People are getting penalized for making money and being successful. Isn’t that the point? The make money, be successful and help other people reach where you got to and GIVE BACK? It’s better to help somebody help themselves rather than just give people money? I’d rather be independent than dependent on the government that is already over a five or six trillion in debt. I think we’ve shown that spending more of what we don’t have doesn’t improve the economy. Okay, and two more things about Obama I know this is getting long. First, why do we separate parties so much and drastically? Like you’re either REPUBLICAN, DEMOCRATIC, or I guess Independent is growing. The lines are so defined that there are stereotypes for each party. Obama is supposed to unite us as a nation, no matter what we believe in. He hasn’t. He’s just split us more apart and pointed out flaws. Lastly, Welfare. Okay, I understand there are people in bad situations that were born into poverty and really need help and are really looking for a job, but the fact of the matter is, I am paying (yes, I have a job) for someone else’s life atm. Some jobs pay less than welfare gives. So why would you want to get a job and have to work when you get paid for doing nothing? Some people think that way. I would just live off welfare if I were in someone like that’s shoes. Welfare was supposed to be a temporary thing. The government’s just extended it for so long that people think that they’re entitled to things now. Also, you get more money the more kids you have. So some people are just having kids when financially they can’t even support themselves! then, those kids are put into poverty just like their parents. It’s a viscous cycle. There are ways to fix this. Honestly, so many freaking opportunities. There are so many organizations that help with these kind of things (Example: I helped out at DRMM an organization in Detroit that give many different kinds of people help such as chronically homeless, abused, addicted, and teen moms shelter. Not just giving them things, but they are strongly encouraged to get an education, they are run on a strict schedule so that they learn to plan their time out, and they are offered religious opportunities) anyway, they have soup kitchens and Feed the hungry organization, blahblah etc. So I mean, Obama isn’t reforming any part of that, he just keeps giving them money so that while we are getting money cut out of our salaries, it’s sometimes going to someone who isn’t doing anything with it. Ahh, just so stupid. And there is a way that could fix it, but more typing and I think I’ve expressed my opinions. Okay, don’t trash me hardcore, I respect your opinions and beliefs.</p>

So you are one of those fools?</p>
<p>Is there anyone in here who likes Obama-/Romneycare?</p>
<p>Obama-/Romneycare is a gift packet to insurance companies, Socialism isn’t giving money to corporations and taking orders from them. If Obama was a true Socialist he would nationalize healthcare and pharmacy. Only this would constitute as a socialist healthcare system (Given that he manage it correctly).</p>

<p>and fair warning I didn’t take the time to make this post polite and don’t expect the same in return, another fair warning I am generalising and do not necessarily mean to generalise, I am doing so for the sake of simplicity in referring to people or groups of people</p>

<p>except they don’t “give back”, want to know how mitt romney got rich? by buying companies, firing half the workforce and reducing pay and pensions for workers, does that seem like giving back to you? this is honestly literally how he got rich by the way, buying companies, firing the workers and fucking the rest of the workers over, jobs are outsourced and all additional revenue is NOT spent back into the company</p>
<p>but seriously, do you think mitt romney is giving back to people by hiding money in offshore accounts and investing it to avoid tax? do you think mitt romney is giving back to people when he has stated that releasing his tax returns would hurt him politically? john mccain in 2008 looked at mitt romneys tax returns and he saw something he didn’t like and went with sarah palin instead, do you think mitt romney is giving back to the people when mccain didn’t want him after seeing his taxes?</p>

<p>and how do you think those shelters are paid for? small organisations and charities help sure but welfare isn’t simply “giving money to the poor”, one thing welfare pays for is fucking food stamps and even little old me who isn’t a us citizen knows this, what, do you think cutting welfare = cutting foods stamps is a good idea?</p>

<p>yes you will get welfare cheats just like you will get people(read:mitt romney) who cheat small businesses by firing workers for personal gain, just because the system is broken doesn’t mean that destroying the system all together is the best idea</p>

        <p>Here in Canada it isn’t the responsibility of the federal government to provide health care. Health care is ran by the provincial(state) government. This is good because it allows different needs for different regions. For example, living in Ontario, I am given free OHIP (ontario health insurance plan) which covers basically everything except for drugs/dentist (any decent employer will cover the rest). When you walk out of the hospital, you never pay a cent.</p>
<p>So in my opinion, in the USA federal elections, it shouldn’t be up to Obama, or Romney, or the federal government to provide free healthcare. This should be a state matter.</p>
<p>USA should look to Canada for a health care model, as we are definitely the most similar country, and our health care system DOES work, and people are NOT complaining. Even our strong conservatives take pride in our free health care and they’re not whining about socialism on this issue.</p>

<p>that’s pretty much how it’s ran in the uk, granted we don’t have states but eh</p>
<p>hospital healthcare is free (to citizens), dentist is free up until 16 or under certain conditions, prescription drugs all cost the same (about $12) and can be free under certain conditions (and if you’re an idiot and want non-generic drugs you can get them too)</p>
