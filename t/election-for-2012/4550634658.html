Here in Canada it isn’t the responsibility of the federal government to provide health care. Health care is ran by the provincial(state) government. This is good because it allows different needs for different regions. For example, living in Ontario, I am given free OHIP (ontario health insurance plan) which covers basically everything except for drugs/dentist (any decent employer will cover the rest). When you walk out of the hospital, you never pay a cent. [/quote]</p>
<p>that’s pretty much how it’s ran in the uk, granted we don’t have states but eh</p>
<p>hospital healthcare is free (to citizens), dentist is free up until 16 or under certain conditions, prescription drugs all cost the same (about $12) and can be free under certain conditions (and if you’re an idiot and want non-generic drugs you can get them too)[/quote]<br>
the thing about any kind of government healthcare is that since the government’s paying for it (although you could use taxes to prove otherwise) they get to tell you what to do. Whereas if you pay for insurance, you can actually tell the health provider what you want to do. Granted it’s not much difference, but the doctor/patient care differs. I’d know this because i had a ski accident back in 2003 in jackson hole wyoming which i’ve had to have several surgeries for my back and neck. I’ve seen the difference between medicare and Aetna for example. The differences would mainly be the treatment you receive from doctors, what the doctors are allowed to do, and the hospitals/doctors you can even go to.</p>
<p>So that’s something people need to take into account. The people on medicare are treated very poorly in my opinion.</p>

<p>That is bullshit though. I get free health insurance and there is no way for me to lose it, nor am I told what to do. It doesn’t matter what my background is, it doesn’t matter what I was doing to get sick/injured, I am always covered for life, from the day I was born. You need to reform it because it works everywhere else. I’d know too since I’ve also had accidents, surgeries, illness and I am free to choose my doctor and hospital, and the quality is excellent.</p>

</aside>
<p>just because it’s government ran(which doesn’t even need to be the case, the NHS in the UK is only government funded and is ran independently) doesn’t mean that the government has all the control, that’s the biggest load of bunk I’ve heard</p>
<p>it’s also not the case that you get told what to do or stuff it, in the uk for example you can change your GP for any reason at all and as far as I know if you require surgery you can get referred to another surgeon through your GP</p>
<p>of course this will greatly vary by country and the NHS has worked through all the kinks for the past 60 years but ‘free healthcare’ doesn’t automatically mean bad healthcare</p>

Here in Canada it isn’t the responsibility of the federal government to provide health care. Health care is ran by the provincial(state) government. This is good because it allows different needs for different regions. For example, living in Ontario, I am given free OHIP (ontario health insurance plan) which covers basically everything except for drugs/dentist (any decent employer will cover the rest). When you walk out of the hospital, you never pay a cent. [/quote]</p>

<p>My girlfriend lived in the UK when she was about 14-15. She was put on a 6-12 month waiting list to get her braces fixed. The back brace had broken off and was destroying her inner lip. Her mom had a type of autoimmune liver disease that needed to be treated, but they were in no hurry to help. When they moved back to the united states, they found out that she was nearing stage 3 of 4 for the liver disease, and that It could have been fatal if not treated right away. From their point of view (all 3 of them living there), the healthcare was horrible compared to that of a middle-classed citizen of the united states.</p>
<p>that sounds like No health-care system I want to live in, Just saying.</p>
<p>In the united states (health-care or not), you can walk into an ER and get seen that day, get surgery within a week, and get billed. If the bill is less then, lets say 2k (minor surgery or tests), they will just threaten to sue you for 7 years then you wont hear from them again (This is from multiple experiences).</p>

<p>My girlfriend lived in the UK when she was about 14-15. She was put on a 6-12 month waiting list to get her braces fixed. The back brace had broken off and was destroying her inner lip. Her mom had a type of autoimmune liver disease that needed to be treated, but they were in no hurry to help. When they moved back to the united states, they found out that she was nearing stage 3 of 4 for the liver disease, and that It could have been fatal if not treated right away. From their point of view (all 3 of them living there), the healthcare was horrible compared to that of a middle-classed citizen of the united states.</p>

<p>it definitely sucks that they had a bad experience but it is definitely not reflective of the nhs as a hole, and there would definitely have been options and courses of actions available to them when they needed them</p>

<p>Here in Canada it isn’t the responsibility of the federal government to provide health care. Health care is ran by the provincial(state) government. This is good because it allows different needs for different regions. For example, living in Ontario, I am given free OHIP (ontario health insurance plan) which covers basically everything except for drugs/dentist (any decent employer will cover the rest). When you walk out of the hospital, you never pay a cent. [/quote]</p>
<p>that’s pretty much how it’s ran in the uk, granted we don’t have states but eh</p>
<p>hospital healthcare is free (to citizens), dentist is free up until 16 or under certain conditions, prescription drugs all cost the same (about $12) and can be free under certain conditions (and if you’re an idiot and want non-generic drugs you can get them too)</p>

<p>that sounds like No health-care system I want to live in, Just saying.</p>
<p>In the united states (health-care or not), you can walk into an ER and get seen that day, get surgery within a week, and get billed. If the bill is less then, lets say 2k (minor surgery or tests), they will just threaten to sue you for 7 years then you wont hear from them again (This is from multiple experiences).[/quote]</p>
<p>The doctors in the United States made my grandmother live with appendicitis for a week, they told her she just wasn’t feeling well. That’s pretty pathetic for something as common and life threatening as appendicitis, which should be operated on the same day as diagnosis. After daily visits to the hospital they finally considered appendicitis, and by the time they flew her back to Canada her appendix had ruptured. As a result of the incompetent american doctors she had to get many organs and pieces of organs removed. Good thing she was in good hands in Canada. That surgery would have costed an American $700,000</p>
<p>I got appendicitis about a year later (in Canada). I went to the ER and they saw me within an hour, and diagnosed within a couple hours. Scheduled me for immediate surgery until a nurse stole the anesthetics haha. So I had to wait for the morning. That was hell and I cant imagine my grandmother living with that for a week.</p>
<p>My point is, shit happens. Neither of our stories are very representative of the overall healthcare of either country. There is no reasons for the quality to be any different. The only difference is that it’s paid by taxes, and there isn’t some fat cat at the top collecting the profits.</p>

<p>no seriously, if you think that there is no income/social/whatever gap between the wealthy and middle class (not even poor) then you are SERIOUSLY DELUSIONAL, there is an extreme income gap between the wealthy and the middle class and the poor get the shit end of the stick in regards to taxes, taxing the rich who can afford to be taxed will result in less tax on the poor and lower middle classes who cannot afford to pay taxes</p>

<p>Also, with ObamaCare, we will have a healthcare system like Canada, and many doctors will quit (my doctor is quitting) now that the government will pay them. </p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>it won’t be anything like canada or any other country with a national health system, it will be much less efficient but better than what you have now at least</p>
<p>in 2009 (keep in mind that this is the same policies from bush pretty much) the states paid almost double what a uk and france citizen pays for the same amount of healthcare, let that just sink in for a minute, me being a uk citizen, if I paid taxes (which I do not because I am unemployed) I would pay half of what you would pay and be entitled to the same amount of healthcare</p>

<p>Like. Seriously? People are getting penalized for making money and being successful. Isn’t that the point? </p>

</aside>
<p>they’re being taxed a fair amount for money they make, we’re not talking about placing a burden on small businesses and entrepreneur here, we’re talking about taxing multi-million dollar companies a fair amount and reinvesting it back into the country, it’s not socialism and it’s not communism it’s called government and it pays for everything you’d consider western culture</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>The make money, be successful and help other people reach where you got to and GIVE BACK? </p>

</aside>
<p>except they don’t “give back”, want to know how mitt romney got rich? by buying companies, firing half the workforce and reducing pay and pensions for workers, does that seem like giving back to you? this is honestly literally how he got rich by the way, buying companies, firing the workers and fucking the rest of the workers over, jobs are outsourced and all additional revenue is NOT spent back into the company</p>
<p>but seriously, do you think mitt romney is giving back to people by hiding money in offshore accounts and investing it to avoid tax? do you think mitt romney is giving back to people when he has stated that releasing his tax returns would hurt him politically? john mccain in 2008 looked at mitt romneys tax returns and he saw something he didn’t like and went with sarah palin instead, do you think mitt romney is giving back to the people when mccain didn’t want him after seeing his taxes?</p>

<p>It’s better to help somebody help themselves rather than just give people money?</p>

</aside>
<p>yes because healthcare = giving people money</p>
<p>you’re talking about healthcare and now you’ve abruptly changed the topic to talking about welfare, maybe if you were more coherent and knew what a paragraph was you wouldn’t come off like someone who is merely parroting an opinion instead of forming one of his own</p>

</aside>
<p>well then good for you, maybe you can stop using the internet that the US government funded research for, maybe you can stop using public roads and stop drinking water from a tap, maybe you can kill yourself at 40 because those extra 30+ years of life expectancy are from medical gains funded in part by the government investment and legislation requiring medical companies to pay x back into research and development</p>

<p>seems to me like funding 2 wars for frivolous reasons doesn’t improve the economy</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>First, why do we separate parties so much and drastically? </p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>because a 2 party system benefits everyone except the general public and the big organisations that benefit from a government they can control will pay a LOT of money to do so</p>
<p>and that isn’t a criticism of obama that’s a criticism of politics in the united states, obama has nothing to do with the 2 party system and its flaws</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>Obama is supposed to unite us as a nation, no matter what we believe in. He hasn’t. He’s just split us more apart and pointed out flaws. </p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>because every president before obama united the nation and every president after obama will unite the nation</p>
<p>hint: multiple parties are there to represent the population, the united states political system is broken because of 2 parties who are almost identical but that’s another issue</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>Lastly, Welfare. Okay, I understand there are people in bad situations that were born into poverty and really need help and are really looking for a job, but the fact of the matter is, I am paying (yes, I have a job) for someone else’s life atm. </p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>oh boo hoo you’re paying so the citizens of your country don’t go to absolute shit cry me a fucking river, that military tax you pay is likely going to go  on taking a life if you want some karmic retribution</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>Some jobs pay less than welfare gives. So why would you want to get a job and have to work when you get paid for doing nothing? </p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>except in that case they aren’t getting “welfare” they are getting several “welfares” for several reasons, the state of welfare in the united states may be in a bad spot but welfare is a necessity in a first would country</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>Also, you get more money the more kids you have. So some people are just having kids when financially they can’t even support themselves! then, those kids are put into poverty just like their parents. It’s a viscous cycle. </p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>how about those people are having kids because people like you and your ilk want to ban abortion and create a social stigma on abortion so they can’t abort those children?</p>
<p>republican logic 101: hurr abortion is wrong lets ban abortion, hurr people are having kids to abuse welfare and not because abortion is illegal</p>
<p>and yes that is seriously how some of you people present yourselves, abortion banned = more children = more republicans cry about welfare families, and I know you aren’t talking about abortion but I’d bet my left testie that you are also against abortion</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>There are ways to fix this. Honestly, so many freaking opportunities. There are so many organizations that help with these kind of things (Example: I helped out at DRMM an organization in Detroit that give many different kinds of people help such as chronically homeless, abused, addicted, and teen moms shelter. </p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>and how do you think those shelters are paid for? small organisations and charities help sure but welfare isn’t simply “giving money to the poor”, one thing welfare pays for is fucking food stamps and even little old me who isn’t a us citizen knows this, what, do you think cutting welfare = cutting foods stamps is a good idea?</p>
<p>like I said welfare in the states may be broken but it is an absolute god damn necessity for some people and I don’t think you necessarily appreciate how much so</p>
<p>yes you will get welfare cheats just like you will get people(read:mitt romney) who cheat small businesses by firing workers for personal gain, just because the system is broken doesn’t mean that destroying the system all together is the best idea</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is there anyone in here who likes Obama-/Romneycare?</p>

</aside>
<p>it’s definitely not the best solution but I guess it helps a hell of a lot of people, things like no more preexisting conditions and children being covered by their parents plan until age 26 are ridiculous breakthroughs from obamacare[/quote]</p>
