    <title>Need help making an RSPS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-making-an-rsps/471114</link>
    <description>Hello everyone I have just recently been interested in making my own RSPS. I am not very good with computers so I need someone to help me through Team-viewer and basically do all the dirty work for me then teach me some stuff to. I am will to pay them real $$$ and give them Admin/Mod status when my server opens. I have a lot of connections that will help me with advertizing the server the only problem is making the server and port forwarding. If anyone could help me that would be great. Also state a price you want for the server and the server type is going to be 508 or something newer and with good or better graphics. You will get payed via paypal after the job is done but if you do it for free that would be even cooler. :)</description>
