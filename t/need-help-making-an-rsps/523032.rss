    <title>Need help making an RSPS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-making-an-rsps/523032</link>
    <description>I need help making an RSPS. I swear to you, i have been trying to make one for about a year or 2 now but my computer always finds a way to mess it up. Anyways I have came to the decision that i may need a helper or coder to help me with making the server. If you can successfully help me make it and get it running, then i&#39;ll make you co-owner. Anyways, if you want to help me, you could either pm me your Skype name or comment it below. One more thing i want to add before posting this is that i am a very cooperative and loyal person.</description>
