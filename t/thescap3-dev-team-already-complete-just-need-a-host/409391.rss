We still need a host. We (Djgrvzz and Cody) made a Project Insanity source 317 loading 612 server. We have custom dungeoneering and a great eco setup. We also have a new point system called PPT. Interested email me at:

[size=14pt][b]thescap3@yahoo.com[/b][/size]

You must be able to keep server 100%.
Not be on a shared computer.
Have a decent internet connection that never goes down.
Or just have a VPS.

 If you host off a VPS for us we will give you 75% of donations.

Thank you.

If you want the website you can find the websites here:

<p>If you already have a team, shouldn’t this go in the server development section? Just ask for a hoster in there. It would also be more logical to get your own VPS cause people can just say, “I have one!” and take your source and release it.</p>
