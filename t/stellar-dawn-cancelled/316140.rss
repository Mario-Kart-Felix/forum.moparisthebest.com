    <title>Stellar Dawn Cancelled?</title>

    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;“Sadly the game was not as complete as we wanted and we spent the first few months trying to “fix” the game where we could. About a month or so ago we took the decision to stop trying to “fix it” as we still wouldn’t have the game we wanted and the game certainly did not meet all the objectives and specifications established in the original game design document and therefore it would be better to go back to the founding principles and build the game we always wanted –Andrew is now overseeing the project and working very closely with the team to build Stellar Dawn, not all was lost as we naturally have developed the game engine substantially over the last few years and the new designs benefits massively from this as well as a ton of experience within the team as to what works and what doesn’t. So whilst the content and a lot of the game play will change from what was previously built almost everything else will go straight back into Stellar Dawn.” - Mark Gerhard&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Discuss.. Maybe it will be open to the public in spring of 2010.. No one knows..</description>

<p>As I said, it looks like they are redoing it from bottom up again… But why cancel it and then restart…</p>
