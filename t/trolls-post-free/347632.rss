    <description>Alright, so basically this is just a post asking about Java itself and the bases such as 317Serv and RS2dv. I used to use things like the old All-star scape servers and delta scape servers, which seem ridiculous compared to the things we have now. If anyone can fill me in on what exactly RS2dv and 317Serv are, in comparison with servers that are already put together. This is more of a thing I want to learn about, since my router doesn&#39;t exactly allow connections from outside, so I can&#39;t have people on my server anyways.</description>
