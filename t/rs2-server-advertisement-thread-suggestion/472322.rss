    <description>sorry if this is wrong area, but i figured it&#39;d be something to discuss for us all.


Why not make it so you can bump your post every 24/12 hours?


I know you can disable post count on some forum boards so they don&#39;t keep getting post count up but i mean why not? If no one post&#39;s the server advertisement just dies out... but if your allowed to bump every 12/24 hours you can still keep up and say hey, this is our server, we are still alive.



Is there any main reason as to why not besides idiots bumping every 2 seconds instead of 12/24 hours a day?</description>
