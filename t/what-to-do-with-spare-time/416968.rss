    <title>What to do with spare time</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-to-do-with-spare-time/416968</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve always dreaded having to ask this question, I never thought I&#39;d have to.. But I really am not sure what to do.

I&#39;m a college student, I go to school two days a week. That leaves 5 days for me to do anything. I haven&#39;t got a job, I&#39;ve looked but my area isn&#39;t that accepting to kids fresh out of high school. That&#39;s no excuse, but I&#39;m not in need of a job anyways.

I don&#39;t want to return to playing games(Runescape specifically), because that took up a large chunk of my life already.

I&#39;m social but not the type to go out every day of the week.

I&#39;ve resorted to watching TED Talks and fulfilling graphic requests on another forum, but that gets boring fast

What do you guys do with your spare time :confused:</description>

^ or a pull-up bar, which is way cheaper and you don’t have to leave the house.<br>
[/quote]<br>
doing pullups is not even close to a substitute for exercising at a real gym.</p>
<p>neither are pushups and situps, but I suppose it depends what your goals are.[/quote]This is why you build a gym at home. Way cheaper in the long run too.</p>

              <p>[quote=“abraham2119, post:18, topic:416968”]Depends on what your goal is: for pure strength training, bodyweight exercises are sufficient but for hypertrophy, they are not.</p>
<p>Don’t listen to m.dog311; instead of buying equipment, get a gym membership – not that expensive really (I’ve seen Ballys with $10/month offers).</p>
<p>Anyways, I currently do a three day split (triceps and chest, biceps and back, and shoulder and legs) and workout every other day. As for my caloric intake, on workout days I eat around 600+ my BMR and try to save all of my (complex) carbs (and calories really) for post workout (think of a IF carb cycling hybrid sort of thing) and on rest days a caloric deficit of around 300-600 with little to no carbs. Simple carbs I absolutely avoid except around 15 minutes pre-workout for energy. Stick to 1g of protein per pound.</p>
<p>I’ve been at it “strictly” (little bit of cheating) for around 3 months and have had great gains: I’ve put on 15 pounds of muscle and cut from ~12% to ~9% body fat.[/quote]<br>
All the gyms in my area are absolutely shit, or horribly expensive ($40+ a month)</p>

              <p>Depends on what your goal is: for pure strength training, bodyweight exercises are sufficient but for hypertrophy, they are not.</p>
<p>Don’t listen to m.dog311; instead of buying equipment, get a gym membership – not that expensive really (I’ve seen Ballys with $10/month offers).</p>
<p>Anyways, I currently do a three day split (triceps and chest, biceps and back, and shoulder and legs) and workout every other day. As for my caloric intake, on workout days I eat around 600+ my BMR and try to save all of my (complex) carbs (and calories really) for post workout (think of a IF carb cycling hybrid sort of thing) and on rest days a caloric deficit of around 300-600 with little to no carbs. Simple carbs I absolutely avoid except around 15 minutes pre-workout for energy. Stick to 1g of protein per pound.</p>
<p>I’ve been at it “strictly” (little bit of cheating) for around 3 months and have had great gains: I’ve put on 15 pounds of muscle and cut from ~12% to ~9% body fat.</p>

<p>doing pullups is not even close to a substitute for exercising at a real gym.</p>
<p>neither are pushups and situps, but I suppose it depends what your goals are.</p>
