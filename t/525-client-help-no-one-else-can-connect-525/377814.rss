              <p>Hey guys ive think I figured it out. I went into my file searches and searched for no-ip and other peopleâ€™s came up i change that, then i searched for 127.0.0.1 and 1 came up. It was the static ip. I think its going to work wiaing for co-owner to come now and test :S wish me luck <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>i think i had this problem, it had something to do with my firewall. to test this, try turning it off simply and trying. if it works then turn it back on and try adding certain programs to the acception list in your firewall till you find the right thing.</p>
