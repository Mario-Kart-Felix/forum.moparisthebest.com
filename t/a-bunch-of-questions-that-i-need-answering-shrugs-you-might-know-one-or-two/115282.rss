    <title>A bunch of questions that I need answering. *Shrugs* You might know one or two</title>

    <description>Alright...Here they are. :)

1) Shops. [s]How do you edit what they have in them, add what they have, [/s]and change the prices of the items?

[s]2) Monsters. How do you spawn &#39;em? (Put them somewhere)[/s] 

3) I was wondering how to place a portal. (That teles you of course, somewhere.)

4) Oooh, since i&#39;m making this post, I might as well tell you the error i&#39;m getting. When I run my server, I get this:
[code]config\objects.cfg: file not found.[/code]
I know this is stupid probably, but how do I fix it? o_O
Ugh..now i&#39;m getting 2 more errors, i&#39;ve been messing around with stuff too much.
[code]client.java:10501: illegal character: \92[/code]
[code]client.java:10635: &#39;else&#39; without &#39;if&#39;
else if &lt;command.startsWith&lt;&quot;runes&quot;&gt;&gt;[/code]
5) How do I stop my spawns from dissapearing every few minutes? (I want them to just be there, untill someone picks them up, THEN they respawn.)

6) How do you make an NPC automatically attack you when you get near it?

[s]7) How do you make a command that teles you somewhere? If you could just give me the code for these 2 commands that&#39;d be great-

::BC Would take you to 3038,3654
::MC Would take you to 3020,3532[/s]

The source I have is one a friend made, but it&#39;s based of CheezScape.

Thanks in advanced guys.</description>

              <p>Ok…When I tried to add a monster through that last time, it messed up my server…I could try again though, see what happens. And how do I get the addglobalobj method?</p>
<p>Wait…do you mean I need that…thing to spawn monsters? :S And how do I get it?</p>
<p>And the shops…its just so confusing, I mean, I can’t tell the item numbers from the amounts! Ugh! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>(And some arent even in the item lists!)<br>
…Update:</p>
<p>YESS! Okay, yay! I know how to add items to the shop, and edit what’s there…But I don’t know how to edit the prices…i don’t think it’s under shops.cfg.<br>

<li>Shops. <span class="bbcode-s">How do you edit what they have in them, add what they have, </span>and change the prices of the items?</li>

<li>
<p>I was wondering how to place a portal. (That teles you of course, somewhere.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oooh, since i’m making this post, I might as well tell you the error i’m getting. When I run my server, I get this:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">config\objects.cfg: file not found.</code></pre>
<p>I know this is stupid probably, but how do I fix it? o_O<br>
Ugh…now i’m getting 2 more errors, i’ve been messing around with stuff too much.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">client.java:10501: illegal character: \92</code></pre>
<p><code>client.java:10635: 'else' without 'if'
else if &lt;command.startsWith&lt;"runes"&gt;&gt;</code><br>
5) How do I stop my spawns from dissapearing every few minutes? (I want them to just be there, untill someone picks them up, THEN they respawn.)</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>How do you make an NPC automatically attack you when you get near it?</li>
</ol>
<p>[s]7) How do you make a command that teles you somewhere? If you could just give me the code for these 2 commands that’d be great-</p>
<p>::BC Would take you to 3038,3654<br>
::MC Would take you to 3020,3532[/s]</p>
<p>The source I have is one a friend made, but it’s based of CheezScape.</p>
<p>Thanks in advanced guys.</p>
