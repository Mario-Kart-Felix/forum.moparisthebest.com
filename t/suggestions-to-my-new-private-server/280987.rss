    <title>Suggestions to my new private server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/suggestions-to-my-new-private-server/280987</link>
    <description>Before you say this doesn&#39;t belong in the help section. I think it does, I&#39;m asking for you to help me with ideas for my new private server that I will be releasing to the public.


[b]Server[/b]
Hopefully I will maintain this server well, I wil be using a very good server source that not many other people use.

I need some suggestions on :-

Server name
Features
Client features
Stability (What to stop ect)
Models
Something unique (I&#39;n not making a map nor model)


Please post your suggestions and what you would like to see on a private server, when I start the development I will post in the development section, thanks.</description>
