    <title>How to extract a file bigger than 4 gigs?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-extract-a-file-bigger-than-4-gigs/75546</link>
    <description>Hi, I have downloaded a compressed file with the internal file being about 4.5 gigs. I was wondering if there is a way to extract it without switching to NTFS. Or If I must switch, is it reversible and will it affect my computer at all?
Thanks
