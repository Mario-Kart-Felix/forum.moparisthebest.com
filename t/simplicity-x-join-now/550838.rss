    <description>[center][size=12pt][u][b]DO NOT DELETE THIS, I HAVEN&#39;T POSTED ANY OTHER ADVERTISEMENTS...[/b][/u][/size]

I&#39;d like to start this off with giving [b]credits to James2613[/b] for releasing his source, which is what my server is based off of. (BoomScape) I don&#39;t have much to brag about yet, or anything that&#39;s going to necessarily &#39;stand-out,&#39; besides one thing, we&#39;re really progressive, and the servers content, and unique features are rapidly growing. We&#39;re basing this server off of player-based content, meaning we&#39;re basing alot of the content, etc off our players and their input to ensure 110% fun, and game quality. We&#39;re striving to become if not the best one of the best servers out. I plan to release this source after a couple years, or more, depending how it goes and so far it&#39;s golden. This is kinda just a intro btw, and this isn&#39;t a &#39;official advertisement&#39;, but don&#39;t delete it, because we need to start gaining a player base, and getting input for features and content, now that all bugs/dupes/glitches are fixed, we&#39;re running off a VPS aswell. ANYWAY, here&#39;s basic info about the server;

- Completed all mini-games
- Bank Pins
- Grand Exchange (finished)
- Secure Money (What I mean by this is that users coins are almost impossible to NULL we spent a lot of time making this fix and it works great!)
- Lottery System (This is a little different from the normal lottery you&#39;d see in a RSPS, a random amount of cash for a reward is created between 1,000,000, and 500,000,000, to enter the lottery you have to buy a ticket, you click the ticket to scratch it, and get the number. When the lottery is ready, the lottery guy will pull a number from his &#39;bowl of numbers&#39;, and if it&#39;s yours you win)
- Glacors (Flawless)
- Duel Arena (We&#39;re working on some preset settings for this)
- Dungeoneering System (Unlike other RSPS&#39; we have a great way of training your Dungeoneering Level, making it difficult and rewarding in a wave system!)
- All Skills Trainable (Literally)
- SoF
- Tons of bosses, and places to train (SERIOUSLY)
- This is a hardish eco server, I want long term players, and I don&#39;t want them being bored
- Auto Voting &amp; donation system added
- Flawless combat rewrote
- Clan lootshare, and full clans added
- Item lending
- Chaotics
- Statius, vesta
- Drygores, offhand wepons too added
- Ascension Crossbow added
- A new bow, a new whip added
- Ganodermics, polypore, fungale, etc added
- Pets for everyone, and donor pets
- New range and mage armor being added

[size=12pt][b]And all the other basic shit you&#39;d normally see in a RSPS
Now to things, that are more unique, and or are being added;[/b][/size]

- Rewriting Achievement system, and changing achievements
- 30+ Achievements
- Team Dungeoneering
- Social Slayer (Duo Slayer)
- New Quest interface, with new quests coming soon
- New mini-games / quests, that reward some items that&#39;ll help you.
- Rewriting thieving
- Adding customizable client, changeable revision, with 2 game-frames to chose from (you can swap in settings, if u ever wanna change back to old one) 
- Rewriting construction ( so It&#39;s like real RS, and BETTER you&#39;ll have to wait for it to come out to know what I mean ;) )
- New mini-map features
- Client Launcher, revamped website / forum
- New Godwars Boss, with armor and a godsword !
- Added a player profiler, and Player Panel, with interface and icon

And there&#39;s some more, will go back over this a edit add more stuff, and pictures!
