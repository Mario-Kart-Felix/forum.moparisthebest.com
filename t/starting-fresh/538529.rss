    <title>Starting Fresh!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/starting-fresh/538529</link>
    <description>Okay, Hello. :)

Around 12 months ago I was right into the whole rsps scene, unfortunately I had to stop and started taking longer shifts at work etc.
Well,, I want to get back in to it now that lifes settled down a bit.

From May 2012 to August 2012 I coded and maintained my own 317. I got over the 317 limitations and moved onto my own 474 server. From August to February 2013 I did the same. Due to real life issues I could no longer keep it up.

So, I&#39;m curious if anyone would want to start up a new server with me, Help me get back into it. (A little motivation never hurt right? :) ) 
I have a fairly basic understanding of how it&#39;s all done. I do pick up and learn quite fast, I&#39;m not expecting to get spoon fed everything.

I&#39;d love to get back into it, I can do all the Graphics, Designs, Forums etc. easily. 

From Australia, 18, Have skype. Not some retard but keen as fuck to do this.
Hit me up if your keen!</description>

<p>… by limitations he obviously meant the errors/bugs/glitches/etc. that come with programming</p>
