    <title>My port 80 is blocked when making a HighScores. How to unblock it?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-port-80-is-blocked-when-making-a-highscores-how-to-unblock-it/293638</link>
    <description>I created an HighScores with the TuT of Creating HighScores link fixed 100%. I did everything right and it work but I need players on my HighScores. So I needed to portforward port 80 so I did it but nothing changed. I either unblock it in my FireWall and it didn&#39;t work. I would like to know how to open my port 80 now ? Or players cannot be on it and I really want my HighScores to work.

Thank you very much if you help.</description>

              <p>But that’s the problem, I got Xampp and I portforwarded port 80 but people can’t connect on it. I tryed <a href="http://canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.org</a> to see if my port was open and it said error connection timed out.</p>
