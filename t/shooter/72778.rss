    <description>Yea this is an excellent film which stars Mark wahlberg an ex Militant who was framed in a shooting for the president. Now I don&#39;t want to ruin it for you people but for the people that did watch it how did u like it? I would give it a 10/10 because its an excellent movie and alot of blood/Heads flying everywhere..</description>
