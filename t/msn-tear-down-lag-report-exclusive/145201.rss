    <description>You may be wondering what msn has to do with runescape? Well as you recall the entire purpose of the lag report was to inform users of the true cause of lag rather then that of myth.

MSN now has everything to do with rs if you are the host of a server.

Before I am warned again:

^[size=7pt][sup]the above photo shows that ther is a contradicting rule which clashes with that of the forum board statement.[/sup][/size]


OK now that, that is out of the way back to the point at hand I am in the right board because this has todo with information concerning lag upon which in development is heavely frowned on.

If you run a server you do not want lag that is why I have posted the Lag Report and now the MSN Tear Down.


The MSN Tear Down goes into how users of the new msn messenger are heavly exposed to lag in which they were not exposed to in previous versions of msn&#39;s work. Development in Lag Prevention (DLP).  Attached is a folder containing the document in which I have written the MSN Tear Down.


All statements in that document that are not backed up with hard evidence will be in the updated report as it comes.


P.S Read my post history to find the Original Lag Report as well as The Lag Report version 2 that was also posted. These reports are there for you to make use of.</description>
