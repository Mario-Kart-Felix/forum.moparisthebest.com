<p>Because if you go solo, you’re going to to fucked over. A team is essential. And honestly I don’t do much pvp on this server, I’ve done a lot more building. However, I think we can all honestly say that pvp died with the area plugin in w1.</p>

Current Rules<br>
Failure to follow these rules on the server may result in punishment.<br>
The staff reserve the right to interpret these rules any way they see fit. The following rules are more like guidelines. You shouldn’t be looking for loopholes in them, rather, you should just get along with them. We’re looking for users that use common sense. For example, we would prefer a user that knows, just because something isn’t on the rules, that it it isn’t necessarily allowed.</p>
<pre><code>[b]No griefing in the game (destroying or doing things with others work without explicit permission from them)[/b]
If someone has griefed you, you can use /hawk tool and then place the given dirt somewhere where your house was destroyed, and it will tell you who did it. TAKE A SCREEN SHOT AND CREATE A REPORT THREAD
No impersonation; don't pretend to be someone else
No flying or other mods used to gain an unfair advantage (xray etc). Use of these tools will earn an instant temporary ban on the first offense, and permanent on the second.
Harvesting someone else's crops is now considered griefing, after the advent of hunger in 1.8.
Admins can't and wont spawn items for anyone.
PvP Specific Rules:
    If someone allows you into their home/residence/castle/mine/city etc, peacefully, you may not kill them and they may not kill you until you leave the location and start from there.
    When we conduct organized wars/battles/raids, obviously there will need to be some destruction in order to gain access to the stronghold, kill the defenders, and claim victory.  But the destruction will be limited to the bare minimum required to do this, with no destruction afterwards.  In other words you can tear a hole in my castle wall to gain access to my castle and kill me and my fellow clansman, but don't destroy anything else afterwards.  Griefing rules apply after the action that is.
    If you kill someone near their bed or spawn area, you cannot kill them again until they have time to get their bearings and escape. This is called 'camping' and will result in a ban if done repeatedly.

Even destroying and replacing blocks to find chests has been allowed. I already knew this, but also had explicit confirmation from tom in-game.</p>
<p>Having the right to interpret the rules in different ways doesn’t mean two members of staff can have opposite points of view, which reflects how they handle reports. This results in completely unfair moderation. These differences in opinion should be discussed and you should come to an agreement.</p>

        <p>My opinion doesn’t change very quickly I’m all for cooperation but the removal of PVP and adding of stupid rules like this isn’t what I’m for. I have encouraged cooperation with potent, and encouraged looting to be looked down upon - BUT I never said I was for the removal of PVP or punishment for activities like it.</p>

<p>No, you’re just bending the rules because you feel the need to get someone banned because you dislike them. On that logic PVP is griefing so I should go ahead and start banning everyone, right? People follow the rules which are stated within the thread you’re the one looking for a loop hole in them in order to punish someone who hasn’t actually broken any rules.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@others</span>: Until all of these long shot interpretations of the rules are stated in the rules then they shouldn’t be enforced. You’re just trapping users in your own personal opinion and that’s not fair. If the staff/anyone would like a debate about it then feel free to post a topic because I have a lot to say in it also.</p>
<p>[quote=“badger41, post:17, topic:419619”]blindly destroying blocks in hopes of finding a secret passage or room should be considered griefing</p>
<p>regardless of if you are going to put the blocks back or not</p>

<p>How is your progress being hindered if he replaces the blocks? How does it damage you?</p>
<p>This isn’t against the rules and as xx matty xx said it should be looked at, but apart from that:</p>

<p>Lilxcj, what do you mean don’t do it again? It’s not in the rules. The players look to the rules in order to determine what they do ingame, not some definition site.</p>
<p>PVP shouldn’t be turned off at all, we can sit it out until the plugin arrives. While PVP/raiding/looting may be looked down upon in world 2 I don’t recall anyone saying it’s against the rules.</p>

<p>I never said I’d ban anyone. I was just trying to clarify that griefing IS a broad term and while others think it may be griefing, other think it may not. We are allowed to interpret the rules as we see fit and just because you see it as a long-shot interpretation, I do not. We have conflicting opinions and that’s because we have different styles of gameplay. Sure, I do not like Magma very much (simply because of the controversy he raises) but I would NEVER allow my own opinion interfere with moderating.</p>
<p>Also, you’re basing previous cases from World 1. I thought we were trying to implement a working friendly system that involved cooperation and working together?</p>
<p>I’d like to address this part:</p>
<blockquote>On that logic PVP is griefing so I should go ahead and start banning everyone, right? People follow the rules which are stated within the thread you're the one looking for a loop hole in them in order to punish someone who hasn't actually broken any rules.</blockquote>
<p>No. You are simply twisting my logic. I simply state the rules once over in this thread, defining that griefing is not allowed in bold and defined what a griefer it. If I’m looking for a loop hole in order to punish someone, would I still be a moderator? I don’t think I would deserve a position if I did such a thing. I do not even see how it’s a long-shot interpretation either!</p>
<p>Rules (Server/Forum):<br>
No griefing -&gt; What is a griefer -&gt; Plenty of things (destroying others progress [buildings], setting them back [stealing], etc).</p>
<p>Then you guys coin the term “raiding” and I completely agree with CoonHunter who brought it up yesterday:<br>
“Raiding is not walking up in there and <span class="bbcode-b">stealing/taking</span> stuff. You completely trash the place as well.”</p>
<p>Should world 2 be a complete mess where we shove things into 5 protected chests then go out looking for others crap to steal and initiate a never ending cycle of annoyances? You cannot say you’ve never felt annoyed having items stolen from you and then tried to steal something yourself. It’s a circle and influences bad feelings towards each other.</p>
<p>On the issue of PVP. I don’t care, so long as the other person agrees to fight. That’s what I thought PVP was for. Player vs Player. Not fucking assassination attempts.</p>

        <p>As it stands it isn’t classed as griefing, so matty shouldn’t be punished I would just like to get that out of the way first. If you want it to class as griefing for the future then you should probably make a topic and we’ll see which direction it goes from there.</p>
<p>As for the twisting of logic, how was I? Stealing hinders a persons progress in wealth, but PVP can also hinder their progress because it looses them time and can be damaging to their situation I don’t get what I’ve twisted :s</p>

What…? I can’t think of any other reason to destroy and rebuild someone’s house. Infact, someone with xray would <span class="bbcode-b">never</span> destroy and rebuild someones house because they can just go straight to the chests. I’ll say it again - people have been doing this for a long time, and staff have always said that it’s absolutely fine if you replace the blocks. Their individual opinions on whether or not this is acceptable may differ, but they were the rules.</p>

i’ve read all the post, and all i can say this is a report about xraying, not about anyone not cooperating in w2, about the pvp rule since pvp has nothing to do with xray and any mod.<br>
if someone uses a mod to get advantage on other players and to raid, it is griefing. looting is allowed but i don’t think anyone would destroy and rebuild someone’s house just to find hidden chests.</p>
<p>i know my opinion is worthless, but magma seems guilty.<br>

What…? I can’t think of any other reason to destroy and rebuild someone’s house. Infact, someone with xray would <span class="bbcode-b">never</span> destroy and rebuild someones house because they can just go straight to the chests. I’ll say it again - people have been doing this for a long time, and staff have always said that it’s absolutely fine if you replace the blocks.

<p>yes they would just to say they don’t xray, as for me, any modification even rebuilding it to someone’s house without permission should be considered griefing.<br>
it’s easy to know when someone xrays just by going under they home and find random tunnels without torches</p>

Well it’s not. So take that up with the staff and community in another topic.</p>

        <p>I would only raid someone if their chest was in the open, I’ve stumbled upon it, or I’ve seen them go into it. If you’ve taken the time to thoroughly hide a chest, it’s pretty ridiculous to be raiding it. Killing someone is perfectly fine, and I fully support. I believe pvp should be on only at night, as to add a greater element of fear, and a plugin that removes the death thing in the chat area (Mongolianbeef has been slain by Agl1431). This way, an assassination is much better, for if you didn’t see them, you would never know. I would even go to the level as to add a plugin that you can’t see a players name behind any inanimate object, making characters always need to watch your back and further a need for teamwork. "If you can see the enemy, the enemy can see you.</p>
<p>Maybe a plugin where names are only seen if you’re cursor is over the person. That way we could have camo-based skins.</p>

<p>imagine if jagex decided that pvp was turned on everywhere, and you didn’t have a choice if you wanted to participate or not… you couldn’t do anything without possibly getting killed, and it would be annoying as hell. That’s how it is in games that take time to build up, unlike games that are MEANT to be PvP, where dying doesn’t lose as much except like a point.</p>
