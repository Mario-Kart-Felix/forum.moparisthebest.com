    <title>This is what happens when anyone tries to run my client. anyone except me</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/this-is-what-happens-when-anyone-tries-to-run-my-client-anyone-except-me/327291</link>
    <description>i uploaded my client to a page where it can be downloaded. when someone tries to run it, it says: &quot;could not find the main class: Gui. program will exit.&quot; the title of the program is: Java Virtual Machine Launcher. i really need help with it. i have no idea how to fix this. if anyone can fix this, i will be grateful. i found this information by downloading it on my other computer. and for an extra thing, i found this... it couldn&#39;t help me, but it might help you:

That&#39;s a classpath error.
javaw -Xmx500m -cp .;Theme.jar Gui
This line is basically saying to the JVM:
Look in the current directory for a file called Gui.class and try to load it and run it&#39;s main method. Classes you may need (even Gui.class) may also be in a file called Theme.jar.
Could not find the main class: Gui. Program will exit
That&#39;s the JVM telling you:
Hey, I couldn&#39;t find that Gui.class file were you told me it was.
Do you see a Gui.class file in the same directory as your batch file?</description>
