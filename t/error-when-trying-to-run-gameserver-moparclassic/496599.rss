    <title>Error when trying to run GameServer (MoparClassic)</title>

    <description>Hi all,

First post :D hoping to stick around for a bit as I&#39;m currently working on my own very crude Java MMO and I&#39;d very much like to get Moparscape to work locally so I can explore and understand the code structure.

I&#39;ve downloaded the source and followed the README for getting the Server to work, having installed Ant, Ivy, MySQL and started up a local web server. The Login Server works perfectly, however when trying to execute &quot;ant run&quot; for the Game Server I&#39;m getting:

EDIT: Okay I hadn&#39;t run the compile script. New problem however is:

[code]Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space[/code]

Which is encountered 3 seconds into the execution of the &quot;ant run&quot; command. I&#39;ve tried increase the MaxHeapSpace assigned to Ant by using &quot;set ANT_OPTS=-Xmx1024M&quot; but this does not seem to make any difference. I read in a few other threads here about adding a similar argument to the run_server.bat file but couldn&#39;t figure out what the required change would be, currently looks like:

[code]@echo off
title GameServer
ant runf2p
pause[/code]

FYI and in case it&#39;s of any use I&#39;m running:

Windows 7 64-bit
16GB RAM
JDK 1.6.0
Ant 1.8.4
Ivy 2.3.0

Let me know if there&#39;s anything else I can give that might be of use. Many thanks in advance.</description>

<p>Try installing a 64 bit JVM.</p>
<p>You could also jar it and run it normally to see if it’s an ant issue.</p>

              <p>Sure, it’s:</p>
<p><code>java version "1.7.0_03"
Java&lt;TM&gt; SE Runtime Environment &lt;build 1.7.0_03-b05&gt;
Java HotSpot&lt;TM&gt; 64-bit Server VM &lt;build 22.1-b02, mixed mode&gt;</code></p>
<p>That sure seems odd, my JAVA_HOME is definitely pointing to <span class="bbcode-b">“C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0”</span>, although it might be worth mentioning I was previously using Java 1.7 before reading up on these forums that Mopar will only work with Java 1.6 and so I downgraded - or at least I thought I had. Perhaps there’s another variable I need to set? There don’t seem to be any other environmental variables relevant to Java though.</p>
<p>EDIT: Been reading up on this a bit, it seems JAVA_HOME variable isn’t respected anymore by almost all software. And it also seems that the latest version of the JRE installed on a system will always take precedence over variable settings. Have just removed JDK and JRE for 1.7 and now “java -version” returns the expected 1.6.0 <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><code>java version "1.6.0"
Java&lt;TM&gt; SE Runtime Environment &lt;build 1.6.0-b105&gt;
Java HotSpot&lt;TM&gt; Client VM &lt;build 1.6.0-b105, mixed mode, sharing&gt;</code></p>
<p>However, the problem still persists…</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

              <p>Sorry I should have mentioned that I am already using the command prompt. How can I increase the heap size available to my command? Or is there a system wide parameter somewhere that I can set to increase this for all ant/java commands? Thanks.</p>

<p>If you are using an IDE and running it from there, that’s probably limiting the max memory. Try using the command prompt or having the IDE allow more memory.</p>
