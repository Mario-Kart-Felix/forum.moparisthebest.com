    <description>Hey guys I have just made My private server and Im having some troubles,
I log in and as soon as i log out and go to log in it keeps saying *account is already logged in try agian in 60 seconds*
But when other players my testers log in and out it works for them they can access the server more then once....
What do i do so it doesnt say that?
o and btw in the server log thing it says im logged in but if i make a new account and log in theres no one there... so i try go back on old account still doesnt work!
PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!!
