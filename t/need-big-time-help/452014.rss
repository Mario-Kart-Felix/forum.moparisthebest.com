    <description>Okay I have absolutely no idea what I did.. All I was doing was editing item stats in the item.cfg file i compiled and didnt get any errors i went to run the server and I get this &quot;Exception is thread &quot;Thread-1&quot;java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could no inititialize class server.Server&quot;
