    <title>New upcoming server!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-upcoming-server/425247</link>
    <description> :eek: :eek: :eek:Just wanted to inform everyone about a server that’s currently in the works.. Before I start though, I’d like to make something clear. I know it’s not uncommon to see “A NEW SERVER” being advertised every month or so. Sadly these servers never make it anywhere due to what I think are bad intentions and lack of experience. Anyways.. It’s no secret that a majority of developer’s intentions fall along the lines of looking for nothing more than financial gain. Yes, you obviously should be paid for your hard work, dedication, and the risk you take. But in the end, greed will turn any server to garbage. That’s a big reason I think this server will grow and prosper. Simply put, the owner isn’t in it for the money. It will be administrated by someone who wants nothing more than an enjoyable game for not only the community, but for himself. Codeforfame will be in charge of the programming aspect of the server, with Hyperkilljoy Administrating, and taking care of the finances.


That being said, let’s talk about the server itself.. Consisting of new content and ideas, this server will be unique from all others currently out there. A good thing is NOTHING on this server will be written in stone until it’s approved by the community. There will be a test server to try out new features and such.. If our members aren’t satisfied, it’ll be re-worked till a majority favor it, or it’ll be trashed. It’s honestly what I feel is needed for RS vets, as well as new comers… A new learning curve that we can all adjust to together. Some may not like it at first, but everything takes time to grow on you. Some new features include…..


-The wilderness being split into two parts. You’ll have your normal wilderness, then you’ll have High risk. When entering high risk, you will automatically skull and be unable to use your protect item feature.  An advantage of high risk is it gives higher drop rates with more npcs spawned for better training. 


-DM arena with a gambling feature. Bet at your own risk! 


-Clan wars with high scores. The top clan after 1-3 months (not decided) will receive a prize. The high scores will then reset for next months challenge. Your clan will always have some sort of recognition showing how many times they’ve been in the top 3 etc...A cool prize I think would be custom capes that will be equitable if you’re a part of the winning clan for the previous month.  


-Slayer!!!! Why you hatin!? Honestly, it’s fun! The feature was mainly put in place for those who don’t exactly care for the skilling part of the game. A lot of people on new servers will just train a flats character, but upon getting there, they don’t have enough gp for full mith.. Doing slayer will grant you points that’ll allow you to purchase decent items. You won’t get anywhere near as rich doing slayer as you would if you done nothing but skill, but it’s enough to get by with and enjoy yourself. Leveling higher in slayer will also give you an opportunity to purchase Slayer items that’ll only be usable on npcs. There WILL be npcs that can only be defeated if you’re wielding certain slayer items. 


-A wild card feature. This is basically a rare random event that happens when skilling. (non-combat) you’ll receive a card in your inventory that can be used at a special store to obtain a current rare item. So far what we’ve got figured out is that these items will change up as the economy advances etc.. So at first, a really good item you may obtain would be an Adam long or something like that. It’s an extra boost to keep people interested, and focused on what they’re doing.



So.. Obviously there are more features than listed, but I feel this is enough to give you an idea of what’s to come. We’d LOVE input from everyone, and if you’d like, you can to join our Ventrilo for more details or in depth talk about the server.. Please PM me for info. 

P.s- Nothing Is for certain yet other than there IS a server already being worked on, and it IS going to have new content. So if something changes from what I’ve listed, don’t hold me to it!    ;)</description>

<p>i’ve always wanted to do a rsc private server. many ideas of them i had but not all. i have great friends who have good ideas of their own that i loved. i brang some ideas up to a few servers but none wanted to do any. i been around rsc since a month after launch so im not new to rsc just kind of unknown in the private servers but well known in classic as a legit ranger… so i figured i would get a team together and make a server and not offer subs for benefits just new content like rsc was (which wont be released for awhile) no pressure into subbing… this is not going to be a here one day gone the next server which alot are because they are in it for the money and if they dont make their money back they bolt.<br>
