    <title>Can anyone give me 1 reason why full Rune/F2P is fine but full Dragon/P2P isn&#39;t?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-anyone-give-me-1-reason-why-full-rune-f2p-is-fine-but-full-dragon-p2p-isnt/535396</link>
    <description>I see no reason why this server should be limited to F2P equips (in F2P&#39;s case, the &quot;limit&quot; is full rune.) Several RSC servers in the past have had full Dragon equips, which would be the &quot;limit&quot; in P2P RSC. 

I don&#39;t see any legitimate reason why holding the game back in the proverbial &quot;Stone Age&quot; of RSC (Pre-dragon equips) is in any way beneficial for any group of players, be it duelers/stakers, skillers or PKers. It&#39;s not like the PKers won&#39;t be able to equip Dragon equips. If you guys enjoy 3-hitting people, you&#39;d do that even more often with Dragon-based weaponry (obviously.)</description>

              <p>Rodgerwilco: As far as I know, that’s the time they released that security feature. They didn’t have it when i first started playing, in december of 2001 or so. I also have quite a few accounts with recovery questions last set around then. For me it was the 28:th of february 2002, to be exact. I also have a few accounts from back in 2002 with “password last changed” set to “never”. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>later? was like 1-2 months after the wild came out… the game was free to play and that’s where people pked because they would find more people. if everyone on earth was worth a million dollars and rsc was $5 a month. everyone would have p2p and pk on p2p worlds.</p>

But on topic. Everytime I play servers with custom items, the pure pking is always fudgeed<br>

<p>Yes, jagex might’ve made it 33, but I’m pretty sure it would’ve stayed 33 if they implemented dragon armor, they would’ve downgraded all other items a bit.</p>

But on topic. Everytime I play servers with custom items, the pure pking is always fucked<br>
specially when they raise the cap level. Jagex intentionally or unintentionally made it so<br>
the max hit is 33 and thus 3 of those would equal 99 hp for a 3 hit. Which is hard to do.<br>
When you add custom items/raise cap you fuck that equation up, and the fights<br>
basically boils down to whoever attacked first.</p>

              <p>I see no reason why this server should be limited to F2P equips (in F2P’s case, the “limit” is full rune.) Several RSC servers in the past have had full Dragon equips, which would be the “limit” in P2P RSC.</p>
<p>I don’t see any legitimate reason why holding the game back in the proverbial “Stone Age” of RSC (Pre-dragon equips) is in any way beneficial for any group of players, be it duelers/stakers, skillers or PKers. It’s not like the PKers won’t be able to equip Dragon equips. If you guys enjoy 3-hitting people, you’d do that even more often with Dragon-based weaponry (obviously.)</p>
