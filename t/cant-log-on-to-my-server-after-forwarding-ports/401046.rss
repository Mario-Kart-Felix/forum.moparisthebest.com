    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-log-on-to-my-server-after-forwarding-ports/401046</link>
    <description>I forward the ports and everything, then i go on to the server and on the command prompt of the server is says connection accepted from (censored) but on the actual client it says error connecting to server. And YES i went into the server notepad file and changed the ip... still not working.
317 server
dlink dir-615

EDIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
