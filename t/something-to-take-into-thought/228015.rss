    <description>Bleh im going to sleep. either way this quote/philosophy/whatever has some pretty deep meaning. take it to thought, i sure did. pretty neat.

  How do we know that sleep isn&#39;t our truest being? and if so, then we are all dreaming. Forever sleeping until we awake in our dreams, and then, once again sleep back to reality. stuck in reality, or stuck in a dream, how many possibilities are gone unseen. open your mind, look outside, maybe were all just a chain untied. think about it, are we all really alive? Is this a realization or a figment of our imagination. sit back and rest a while, live the fantasy with me. - Scagz

For all of you that don&#39;t understand this sort of stuff. its implying the possibility of alter universes or such subject. Think about it, sleeping [b][i]could[/i][/b] be our true being.</description>

<p>If I remember, you said that this is the best way for new people to get farther in the community. Although I agree this was a lame attempt at sounding deep.</p>
