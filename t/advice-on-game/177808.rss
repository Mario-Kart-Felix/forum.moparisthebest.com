    <description>I want to make my first game and I have decided on blackjack because it is a very simple concept. I just want to have it embeded on a page on my site. What do you more experienced coders think would be easier, have a java server running to handle it or use sql? I am leaning towards sql because I can&#39;t even seem to make a working java chat server yet lol... Also, can you think of anyhtign that might be hard to do while making it?</description>
