              <p>lol check out this 1 its vrey easy + good too<br>
this is not mine i didnt right it none credit goes to me<br>
its attached its relly good and u could learn how to do a<br>
report for ur miner</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">To begin your autotalker you first write Program at the top of the script.
After Program you make a name for it.
Example:

Program AutoTalker; 


After Program we have something called Variables.
Variables are an unknown or something we dont know but the script will help us find out.
So After Program underneath of it right Var and leave a line underneath of it because we arent to that part yet.

After Var we have Constants Abbreviated Const.
A Constant Is A Variable that stays the same throughout the entire script.
Our Const in this script will be the following:

Const 
Message1=''; 
Message2=''; 


More will be added but that is all for now.

After we are done with Const we need to make our first procedure!!!!
A Procedure is a Part in the script that is made up of functions later to be added to the main loop.

So underneath your Const Write:

Procedure AutoTalkin;

You can make a different name that is just the one im using.

And then write begin underneath of it to start the procedure.

Under Begin we will write this:

Procedure AutoTalkin; 
Begin 
SendKeysSilent(Message1); 


SendKeysSilent- send string to Client's window.
Which in this case is Runescape.
So this means that whatever is inbetween

Const
Message1'Whatever is inbetween here will be typed on the runescape screen';

so it will type that message in but that doesnt really do any good we need to send the message.

But before we do that we need to wait a little bit
To wait you do this:

Wait(1000); in ms so that =1 Second.
But to make it more undetectable we write this:

Wait(100+Random(10));

This will wait 1 tenth of a second plus a random 10 ms
Less detectability!!!

Now to send the message we need to Press enter we use this function:

SendKeysSilent(chr(13)); 



This pushes enter button so now Message one has been sent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
But we are doing two messages.

so we then add this underneath of that:

SendKeysSilent(Message2);//types in message two
Wait(100+Random(10));//Random wait
SendKeysSilent(chr(13));//Presses Enter

So Now so fAr you should have this:

Program AutoTalker; 
Var 
	 
Const 
Message1='Josh Rox';//First Message1. 
Message2='I still do';//Second Message. 
 
Procedure AutoTalkin; 
Begin 
SendKeysSilent(Message1); 
Wait(100+Random(10)); 
SendKeysSilent(chr(13)); 
SendKeysSilent(Message2); 
Wait(100+Random(10)); 
SendKeysSilent(chr(13)); 



notice there is no wait inbetween Message 1 and 2 so we need to take care of that!
Start off by puting this and I will later explain what this does.

Procedure AutoTalkin; 
Begin 
SendKeysSilent(Message1); 
Wait(100+Random(10)); 
SendKeysSilent(chr(13)); 
Wait(TimeJ); 
SendKeysSilent(Message2); 
Wait(100+Random(10)); 
SendKeysSilent(chr(13)); 
Wait(TimeJ); 


Notice I added Wait(TimeJ); In Two different Places

This is Just Like
Wait(100+Random(10));

But this allows the user to say how many seconds inbetween messages.
You do this by making a Const

The Const we now make will be Called;

Timej

So in const add this:

Const 
Message1='Josh Rox';//First Message1. 
Message2='I still do';//Second Message. 
TimeJ=2000;//How Much Time To Wait Inbetween clicks.  


Now It will wait for how evermany seconds are set by user.

Now At the end of the procedure put

end;

Your Script Should Now Look Like This:

Program AutoTalker; 
Var 
 
Const 
Message1='Josh Rox';//First Message1. 
Message2='I still do';//Second Message. 
TimeJ=2000;//How Much Time To Wait Inbetween clicks. 
Procedure AutoTalkin; 
Begin 
SendKeysSilent(Message1); 
Wait(100+Random(10)); 
SendKeysSilent(chr(13)); 
Wait(TimeJ); 
SendKeysSilent(Message2); 
Wait(100+Random(10)); 
SendKeysSilent(chr(13)); 
Wait(TimeJ); 
end; 


Now we need toadd our Main Loop
Main Loop- Our Map to the SCript.

Start It Out with Just

Begin

Do not name itor anything

so we write

Begin
Counter:=0

Now Counter is our variable that we left a spot for

so in Var
We Write

Var
counter:integer;
It is an Integer because It stores Numbers.

Counter is going to be used to count how many times we said the message.

After

Begin
Counter:=0;
We Put Repeat
that means anything below it that it will repeat that.

So we have

Begin
Counter:=0
Repeat

The we put

AutoTalkin;

Because that is the name of the Procedure.

Sowe now have:

Begin
Counter:=0
Repeat
AutoTalkin;

then we write this (this is where counter comes in)

Counter:=Counter+1

This is sayin everytime the script is ran the you add 1 to the counter you see the counter starts out at 0 and everytime it goes through loop it adds one.
After Counter:=Counter+1

We Will make our Progress Report!!!!

Writeln('You have AutoWrote Your Message '+ inttostr(Counter)+ ' Times!'); 
Writeln('You Have Been Writing This Message:'); 
Writeln(Message1); 
Writeln('And This Message:'); 
Writeln(Message2); 
Writeln('AutoTalker Made By Jlewis');



This is what it will look like now i will explain the lines.
the first line:

Writeln('You have AutoTalked Your Message '+ inttostr(Counter)+ ' Times!');

Writeln-writes text in debug box.

It writes You have Autotalked your message

+inttostr(Counter)+

Means how ever many counter equals now it puts in into that space

So it would look like this:

You have Autotalked your message 10 Times!

Then it says You Have Been Writing This Message

and underneath that it tells you what you are writing in.

And it then does the same for the other Message

Sfter that you Can Make a Line For yourself :

Like Made By JLEWIS or somtin.


After that we write

Until(Counter=SayAmount);
End.

Until means Repeat until Counter = SAyAmount

Sayamount will be a new Const we are going to add.

So now our Const should be:

Const 
Message1='Josh Rox';//First Message1. 
Message2='I still do';//Second Message. 
SayAmount=10;//How Many Times To Type Your Message. 
TimeJ=2000;//How Much Time To Wait Inbetween clicks. 



SayAmount just says how many times to run it

So if SAyAmount =10 and Counter=SAyAmount

And

It says Until(counter=SayAmount)
Then it will

end.

Once Counter= 10

So here is the full script:

Program AutoTalker; 
Var 
Counter:Integer; 
Const 
Message1='Josh Rox';//First Message1. 
Message2='I still do';//Second Message. 
SayAmount=10;//How Many Times To Type Your Message. 
TimeJ=2000;//How Much Time To Wait Inbetween clicks. 
Procedure AutoTalkin; 
Begin 
SendKeysSilent(Message1); 
Wait(100+Random(10)); 
SendKeysSilent(chr(13)); 
Wait(TimeJ); 
SendKeysSilent(Message2); 
Wait(100+Random(10)); 
SendKeysSilent(chr(13)); 
Wait(TimeJ); 
end; 
 
begin 
Counter:=0 
repeat 
AutoTalkin; 
Counter:=counter+1 
Writeln('You have AutoWrote Your Message '+ inttostr(Counter)+ ' Times!'); 
Writeln('You Have Been Writing This Message:'); 
Writeln(Message1); 
Writeln('And This Message:'); 
Writeln(Message2); 
Writeln('AutoTalker Made By Jlewis'); 
Until(Counter=SayAmount); 
End. 



Ty Hope You Enjoy The tutorial
