    <description>Not sure if you guys know about this, but apparently this is a 2D MMORPG engine.

http://www.touchofdeathforums.com/eclipse/

I&#39;ve seen this around here and there, but never actually put any thought into it. I think I saw a couple of games running on this. There was a MMO RPG game that I saw back in the day. Something like Revolutionary RPG or something like that. It was a game that used sprites from old RPG games (SNES-ish era) for it&#39;s game graphics.

I&#39;ve also seen a MMORPG focused of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past a while back. But as I said, I never really looked into it.

There&#39;s a couple of tutorials on the site, but not much too helpful. But I guess everything can be solved with trial and error, right? Anyways, here&#39;s what I have to offer. I&#39;ll be posting other items of interest if I find any.</description>

              <p>Well, I’m not sure whats changed over the years.</p>
<p>but last I remembered, its one of those easy-way-outs like rpgmaker or gamemaker. No scripting or programming is required to make the game. And it’s practically drag and drop. Every game comes out the same though. “but jme… you can script in it” stfu its visual basic</p>
