    <description>Hello

Yesterday i tried to join a server from my friend and it loaded unusual fast, i thought its no big deal, tried to login and it got stuck at 50%

He told me deleted the cache and reload again, it went alot slower but now i try to Login to the game its stuck at 99% always, whenever i try to open it again it get stuck at 50% again

Also, he sees me ingame but i cant see him, its like the game freezes

please some help on this one.
