    <title>Images, Videos, scroll, etc... Stops every 1 second for about a half-a-second</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/images-videos-scroll-etc-stops-every-1-second-for-about-a-half-a-second/133779</link>
    <description>Okay I&#39;ve this problem ever since I got my viruses. I deleted all my viruses, and I still have it. I&#39;ve gotten rid of it before, even when I have my viruses. The problem is, I get this pause thing for a split second for everything that moves and it pisses me off because it ruins videos for when I try and record, and it just annoys me. Has anyone ever had this problem, or does anyone have any idea how to stop it?

Thanks,

~Lin

[i]Edit: I actually have one virus tbh, an ad-aware one, just spawns popups outta nowhere. I have McAfee delete it once, but it came back. Could that be it?[/i]</description>

              <p>i have the same probleme, is it the monitor goes black? this is caused by my graphics card because my screen resolution is too high for it to power at times, especially while watching movies</p>
<p>Update:</p>
<p>if it is your graphics card and you have an ATI one go to the Catalyst control center -&gt; Digital Panel Properties -&gt; check the reduce DVI frequency on high resolution displays…</p>
<p>hope it helps</p>

My explorer.exe has been gay, it’s usually at like 80%, and then I got my stuff that’s running, which doesn’t have enough to make it 100%, which it 90% of the time is at.</p>
<p>Hmm I just noticed FireFox is at 2% now, and when I scroll, it goes to 40% and then 60%, when I stop, it goes back down to 2… Right now explorer.exe is at 2%, occasionally goes up to 24 then 40%.</p>

              <p>Okay I’ve this problem ever since I got my viruses. I deleted all my viruses, and I still have it. I’ve gotten rid of it before, even when I have my viruses. The problem is, I get this pause thing for a split second for everything that moves and it pisses me off because it ruins videos for when I try and record, and it just annoys me. Has anyone ever had this problem, or does anyone have any idea how to stop it?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-i">Edit: I actually have one virus tbh, an ad-aware one, just spawns popups outta nowhere. I have McAfee delete it once, but it came back. Could that be it?</span></p>
