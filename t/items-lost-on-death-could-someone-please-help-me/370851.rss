    <title>Items lost on death - Could someone please help me?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/items-lost-on-death-could-someone-please-help-me/370851</link>
    <description>hey guys,
I&#39;m trying to make an rsps(525)
but I have a slight problem and I was wondering if someone would be kind enough to help me?

Well here&#39;s my problem:
When the character dies they don&#39;t loose any items for some strange reason:/
and I want to add the death emote when the character dies...
so if someone could please help me that would be greatly appreciated :(

Thanks.  ;)</description>

<p>Death method?<br>
an NPC kills me and I spawn @ home? :L<br>
