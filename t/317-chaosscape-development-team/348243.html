<p>===============What’s currently being worked on===============</p>
<p>To avoid leaking I am going to be releasing the first distribution under my name. This is because I don’t want to be in a position where my code gets stolen and released under someone else’s identity. But at the moment I am just packaging and documenting the code, I’ve added some voids that were missing, which are commonly used in other sources but got removed. I hope this will make developing with this source a little bit easier and less painful for the new beginners. For more confident coders, this isn’t a big update.</p>
<p>[color=navy]<span class="bbcode-b">Website Department:</span> With the site source there were some changes that had been made to php since 2007 which caused the site to play up and load a white page. I’ve patched every page up, fixed an exploit in the player inbox centre and currently working on new a clone version of the knowledge base guide but modifying it so site owners will be able to add additional pages to the site without creating a new .php page. In the future I hope to create a admin panel which will allow site admins to edit/add/delete pages without having to go through phpmyadmin.<br>
So far:<br>
[list]<br>
[li]Implanted FaceBook into the site which allows users to post comments and ‘Like’ using their FaceBook account. [/li]<br>
[li]Working on the admin control panel. We spent about 20 hours in the last day trying to make a page that allowed the news to be posted from a web page rather than having to go through phpmyadmin. Unfortunately, we had the script right but it wouldn’t work and we eventually realized that the table started with a ‘[’ which caused the script to fail. So we had to rename our tables and change the site to be able to read from the database. <em>sigh</em> But we got there in the end.  [/li]<br>
[li]Fixed up some code that wasn’t working the way it should of across the site.[/li]<br>
[li] Fixed the download page [/li]<br>
[li] Added a footer but for some reason it screws up the whole site in IE explorer so we got rid of it for the front page until I can be bothered to fix it. It’s not really a major concern right now to have this feature.[/li]<br>
[li] Updated the staff list in the knowledge base and will be adding kind of like a ‘About me’ section for each staff member which allows people to read up on the staff. - you know, just incase you wanted to become obsessed with us and stalk us on twitter and FaceBook.[/li]<br>
[li] Added a twitter site (clone) <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> which is aimed at inviting it’s users to use it for private server development.[/li]<br>
[li] Created a proper design layout for the aforementioned site above.[/li]<br>
[li] Updated the logo to something that looks more authentic.[/li]<br>
[li] Added the FaceBook ‘Like’ function to the knowledge base. But I removed it because it caused some alignment errors but I will re add it soon.[/li]<br>
[li] Built a server status page. This allows users to advertise their private servers pretty much a status checker just like Mopar’s but we encourage it only to be used by people who are running ChaosScape. But we have no way to moderate this so DAMMNNN. :([/li]<br>
[li] Working on the admin site and trying to theme it with a descent design. At the moment it’s just a boring white page with a form. &gt;.&gt;[/li][/list]<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Introduction:</span></p>
<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>Before I go into depth about the development team and products I want to tell you a little about myself, I hope that this about me section will help make up your mind if this is a worthwhile project to take part in and if you think I’m the sort of person who would make good use of your time.<br>
Hi, I’m EwfsPrince (my alias) I’m 18 years old from South Australia and currently finishing high school. My biggest specialty is web design and coding, which I’ve been doing ever since I was 10 years old.<br>
I also code Java but I admit I’m not as fluent as I would like to be in the language, however there are some coding similarities between Java and PHP for example which have made learning a lot simpler and I am usually able to overcome any problems with my Java work – even though sometimes they may take a bit longer than the typical fluent coder.<br>
I am recruiting a team of dedicated people to help assist in the development of ChaosScape and in addition also in the development of our server related products that will be released under GPL licensing to the public.</p>
<p>All members of the development team will be rewarded for their contributions, one way we reward everyone is by giving them free Unlimited hosting + cPanel (subject to fair use policy) which is provided by the web hosting enterprise that I run and manage.<br>
We want our team to be successful, which is why we are spending a lot of time creating tools and privately owned websites to help create a friendly working environment. We consider ourselves a different breed of development team and we do require very mature team, we prefer to recruit people who are over the age of 16 but we are willing to make exceptions if maturity is shown in the application process.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Our goal</span><br>
Our goal is to change the way we develop private servers. Not in the types of servers we code, not whether we code 317’s or 600+'s but the way we think about developing our servers. For too long as MoparScapians have been held back in our progress by leechers and over time our more confident coders have left the community because of them and the fact that the RSPS’s aren’t moving forward quickly enough.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What do I mean by moving forward?</span><br>
All of our servers are underdeveloped, there isn’t a server out there that isn’t and it’s because of a number of reasons which most of you would probably be able to work out but one of them is that we don’t collaborate our work, we mainly post them on a forum and be done with it. It is proven when we share and talk about these things we learn differently to how we would just by reading, we soak up new information that we didn’t understand before.<br>
There’s more I want to say, but I won’t waste any more of your time on this point.</p>
<p>So, ChaosScape is more than a server project and I’m just going to give you a brief feature list of what is going to be released:</p>
<p>[list]<br>
[li]A 317 standard source[/li]<br>
[li]A 317 MySQL server version source[/li]<br>
[li]A fully functional RuneScape site with PHP + MySQL with intergration with the MySQL server.[/li]<br>
[/list]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">But it doesn’t stop there!</span><br>
We will also be creating tutorials, reference guides specific for our server source which will in effect teach you how to develop with our source code which will make it an ideal base for your next project.<br>
All of the code is open, none of it is anti-leech.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">Won’t this project source just get leeched?</span></span></p>
<p>All of our work will be continuously worked on, this means that leechers will have NO chance to compete with us. In my theory leeched servers only occur when a development team stops working on their source, and then posts it and 2 months later (once everyone forgotten about it) it gets posted under a different name. This source is more like a package and once it’s been released it’s structure and identity will not be mistaken for anything else and the average user will be able to tell how much the source has been modified. EASY!</p>
<p>We have most of the site and both 317 server sources almost built, they just need a few more patches than I will release the first distribution to the public. Once it has been released the development team will be able to develop on it and make changes which will be released in the next version and so forth.<br>
Some of you might be wondering why I was discussing about collaborating work, at the moment it won’t make entirely sense to you but in the release of the first version it will become clear. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

The above privacy policy is just to protect my butt since I’m could potentially be gathering information from minors as young as 10? (children lie about their age all the time).</p>

<p>So far I am happy with all of your applications and from this point I can nearly guarantee your on the team. I’ll add you all on MSN or private message you in some other means in the next day or so. On a side note In your applications I look for things (which I can’t disclose :P) but they do tell me a lot about yourself eg.</p>
<blockquote>[Quote from teufel's application]

[i][b]this is just like the question above it[/i][/b]</blockquote>
That says a lot about the way he thinks, even though in my opinion I think he's wrong. :P
<p>Thanks for everyone who has applied so far.</p>

<p>How many hours a week do you spend online? 24-50 Hours<br>
What previous experience have you had previously in the desired position(s)?<br>
I have been with RSPS for about 4 years now<br>
What projects online (Private servers, websites, IRC etc) have you been involved with?<br>
Tacocoders, SiverScape, leaf Ninja, 404scape,<br>
Why do you think we should choose you?<br>
I am a fun loving person, dedicated, have a lot of experience.<br>
How can you personally make a positive impact on the development team?<br>
Well I wont get mad, i will try to help at the best way i can.<br>
By typing ‘Yes’ below you agree that you are submitting your true contact details and that you are submitting this form for yourself and only for yourself and not on the behalf of anyone else. You agree that we may keep a copy of your application and keep it in the case that you decided to apply again and or if we decide to recruit you to a development team. You may decide to terminate your application by sending your name, e-mail address in an e-mail to <a href="mailto:michael@mynetbook.net">michael@mynetbook.net</a>. This will cause any proceedings with your application to no longer continue and we will not contact you for future recruitment’s until you apply again, however we will keep your application in our records for however long we seem fit. At any one time your application will not be viewable to the public and your details will not be sold or passed onto 3rd parties or anyone without your consent. In a case of a legal dispute between two parties or within the law of any country this information will be surrounded accordingly. You also agree that you are submitting your correct current age.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Extra: I already have made a client, starting from scratch, preloaded all skill capes, all necessary items that are needed in order to make a good private server and with all correct animations to those items, e.g. God swords, defender block, stances, etc. I do not believe in player made custom items and I will not have them in this client. the cache is untouched, all models are preloaded(thanks to client hax), All head icons are loaded through the cache their is absolutely no outside loaded sprites, all sprites are loaded through the cache. All the bottom right icons are loaded through the cache anyways. and you wouldn’t believe me but the client is only 15mb, compressed and 22mb uncompressed, this is really nice 317 client:), I will add everything requested even if it goes against what I believe in.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Applying for:</span> I am willing to be any of the following, as you see fit, in order of preference:</p>
<ol>
<li>Java Coder (Specifically source coding)</li>
<li>In-game Moderator</li>
<li>Staff Site Moderator</li>
<li>Debugger &amp; Beta Tester<br>
5.Content Manager (I would like more info on this)</li>
<li>Customer Support</li>
<li>Article Writer (More info on this as well)</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">How many hours a week do you spend online? 1-3 Hours 3-10 Hours 10-24 Hours 24-50 Hours 50 Hours +</span><br>
24-50, though it varies day to day, as well as things like vacations and such.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What previous experience have you had previously in the desired position(s)?</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Java Coder</span>-Been involved with RSPS about 3-4 years now. I’ve been doing on and off coding for about 2 of those years. I am fluent enough in java to edit server sources and write basic programs, often with much trial and error. I am still learning though, and I think working with other coders could be a good experience for me.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Ingame/Forum Mod</span>- I have been mod/admin/co-owner in many servers that I played, and forum mod on a few.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Debugger/Beta Tester</span>- Never been this before, but I’m always open to learn something new.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Content Manager</span>- Same as above.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Customer Support</span>- I’ve never been an “official” Customer Support person before, but I do enjoy helping people, and I get along well with others.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Article Writer</span>- As you can see from this application, I don’t mind typing a lot. I enjoy writing and, not bragging at all, I am quite good at it. I also have an exstensive vocabulary, as well as good grammar and a natural talent for spelling. Though if I were to get this position, I would like to pair it with another, and do this as needed.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What projects online (Private servers, websites, IRC etc) have you been involved with?</span><br>
My own personal servers, and Rune-Maker, which basically fell apart because of an inactive owner.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Why do you think we should choose you?</span><br>
I see myself as having a fairly decent amount of experience in all of the positions, except the ones I don’t know. I have been searching for a dedicated team for some time now because most fall apart eventually, but this one shows much potential. I think I could make a good addition to this team.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">How can you personally make a positive impact on the development team?</span><br>
I am a friendly, cooperative person. I get along well and enjoy working with a team more than alone. I am here to be a part of the team and hopefully learn something to help expand my knowledge of java.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">I would also like to say I am in the progress of applying to another team, though this seems more promising. I may remove my app depending on how it works out. </span></span></p>
