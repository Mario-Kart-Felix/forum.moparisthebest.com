<p><span class="bbcode-b">Why do you think we should choose you?</span><br>
I know what I’m doing, and I know my Java well; most of the people nowadays are lazy that will half-ass everything just to get the job done quickly - I value quality over quantity and perfect everything before I move on to the next thing.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">How can you personally make a positive impact on the development team?</span><br>
I aspire to create a good private server - whether it be by myself or within a team. I’ve been doing this for almost 3 years and I’m not quitting any time soon.</p>

What previous experience have you had previously in the desired position(s)? 50+ hours, I’m not on AS MUCH on the weekends, because that’s when I get MOST of my assignments done.  I’m a polyphasic sleeper, so I get a lot done in the 22 hours I am awake.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">What projects online (Private servers, websites, IRC etc) have you been involved with?</span></span></p>
<p>Rasek Scape (RSPS),  Unreal Scape (RSPS), Power Element, LibertyScape (RSPS)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Why do you think we should choose you?</span></span></p>
<p>I am dedicated, supportive, outgoing, ideal, affable, easy to get along with, mature, dependable, and responsible.  You tell me to jump and I’ll say “how high.”  I’m awake 22 hours a day (polyphasic sleeper), I’m good at my math skills, and I’ve been doing programming &amp; website engine/scripting ever since I was 11.   I know my way around the notepad and I’ll get things done right.</p>
<p>Also, just to be somewhat logical (instead of claiming) I’d rather show you, then tell you.  I’m willing to show all my work that I’ve done.  You’ll also probably find my syntax and neatness to be quite effective once others get around and when we start sharing experiences in web development.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">How can you personally make a positive impact on the development team?</span></span></p>
<p>Honor, integrity, loyal, and respect.  Some of my traits that I carry along with me as I expand throughout my life.   Reaching new standards, and solving problems.  I enjoy math, I enjoy programming, over all, I enjoy creating things.  I believe my impact on the team will differ throughout my experiences with them.  Along with giving my best effort I can, and doing <span class="bbcode-u">all</span> that I can for such a significant build of human minds being compressed into one bottle feed, constantly thinking of new ideas to be implemented into such a thing that can bring few together.  I’m looking forward to what impact I will see to make on the team.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Primadude, post:112, topic:348243”]I’m applying for this mainly for the reason that I want to put my time to good use, rather than doing basically nothing and working on my own server individually.</p>

24-50 hours.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">What projects online (Private servers, websites, IRC etc) have you been involved with?</span><br>
I don’t usually work with teams, however I’m currently working on my own project, iClarity.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Why do you think we should choose you?</span><br>
I know what I’m doing, and I know my Java well; most of the people nowadays are lazy that will half-ass everything just to get the job done quickly - I value quality over quantity and perfect everything before I move on to the next thing.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">How can you personally make a positive impact on the development team?</span><br>
I aspire to create a good private server - whether it be by myself or within a team. I’ve been doing this for almost 3 years and I’m not quitting any time soon.</p>

What previous experience have you had previously in the desired position(s)? 50+ hours, I’m not on AS MUCH on the weekends, because that’s when I get MOST of my assignments done.  I’m a polyphasic sleeper, so I get a lot done in the 22 hours I am awake.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">What projects online (Private servers, websites, IRC etc) have you been involved with?</span></span></p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Why do you think we should choose you?</span></span></p>
<p>I am dedicated, supportive, outgoing, ideal, affable, easy to get along with, mature, dependable, and responsible.  You tell me to jump and I’ll say “how high.”  I’m awake 22 hours a day (polyphasic sleeper), I’m good at my math skills, and I’ve been doing programming &amp; website engine/scripting ever since I was 11.   I know my way around the notepad and I’ll get things done right.</p>
<p>Also, just to be somewhat logical (instead of claiming) I’d rather show you, then tell you.  I’m willing to show all my work that I’ve done.  You’ll also probably find my syntax and neatness to be quite effective once others get around and when we start sharing experiences in web development.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">How can you personally make a positive impact on the development team?</span></span></p>
<p>Honor, integrity, loyal, and respect.  Some of my traits that I carry along with me as I expand throughout my life.   Reaching new standards, and solving problems.  I enjoy math, I enjoy programming, over all, I enjoy creating things.  I believe my impact on the team will differ throughout my experiences with them.  Along with giving my best effort I can, and doing <span class="bbcode-u">all</span> that I can for such a significant build of human minds being compressed into one bottle feed, constantly thinking of new ideas to be implemented into such a thing that can bring few together.  I’m looking forward to what impact I will see to make on the team.</p>

How many hours a week do you spend online? I have my own Laptop, I have school for 8 hours of the day 5 days a week. I’m guessing 1-2 hours each day, 7 hours a week.<br>
What previous experience have you had previously in the desired position(s) I have worked with website building in school alot with mainly HTML. I do also know a fair amount of c++, And Java.<br>
What projects online (Private servers, websites, IRC etc) have you been involved with?<br>
Well I have worked on a 3d fps Game with Gamestudio a7. I work on private servers just for fun.<br>
Why do you think we should choose you? In the past I’ve applied for a position and the team dies out and the server never gets out. This seems like a good team and I will do whatever I can do help make us successful.<br>
How can you personally make a positive impact on the development team?<br>
I can handle donations, I’m very good at math. I’m thinking about joining the Air Force with ROTC and I also have alot of great ideas for servers.<br>
