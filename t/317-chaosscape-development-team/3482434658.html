<p><span class="bbcode-b">Applying for:</span> I am willing to be any of the following, as you see fit, in order of preference:</p>
<ol>
<li>Java Coder (Specifically source coding)</li>
<li>In-game Moderator</li>
<li>Staff Site Moderator</li>
<li>Debugger &amp; Beta Tester<br>

</ol>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">How many hours a week do you spend online? 1-3 Hours 3-10 Hours 10-24 Hours 24-50 Hours 50 Hours +</span><br>
24-50, though it varies day to day, as well as things like vacations and such.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What previous experience have you had previously in the desired position(s)?</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Java Coder</span>-Been involved with RSPS about 3-4 years now. I’ve been doing on and off coding for about 2 of those years. I am fluent enough in java to edit server sources and write basic programs, often with much trial and error. I am still learning though, and I think working with other coders could be a good experience for me.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Ingame/Forum Mod</span>- I have been mod/admin/co-owner in many servers that I played, and forum mod on a few.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Debugger/Beta Tester</span>- Never been this before, but I’m always open to learn something new.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Content Manager</span>- Same as above.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Customer Support</span>- I’ve never been an “official” Customer Support person before, but I do enjoy helping people, and I get along well with others.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Article Writer</span>- As you can see from this application, I don’t mind typing a lot. I enjoy writing and, not bragging at all, I am quite good at it. I also have an exstensive vocabulary, as well as good grammar and a natural talent for spelling. Though if I were to get this position, I would like to pair it with another, and do this as needed.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What projects online (Private servers, websites, IRC etc) have you been involved with?</span><br>
My own personal servers, and Rune-Maker, which basically fell apart because of an inactive owner.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Why do you think we should choose you?</span><br>
I see myself as having a fairly decent amount of experience in all of the positions, except the ones I don’t know. I have been searching for a dedicated team for some time now because most fall apart eventually, but this one shows much potential. I think I could make a good addition to this team.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">How can you personally make a positive impact on the development team?</span><br>
I am a friendly, cooperative person. I get along well and enjoy working with a team more than alone. I am here to be a part of the team and hopefully learn something to help expand my knowledge of java.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">I would also like to say I am in the progress of applying to another team, though this seems more promising. I may remove my app depending on how it works out. </span></span></p>

<p>(Yes)[/quote]</p>
<p>As we discussed on MSN I wasn’t happy with allowing someone as young as your age to be a admin. Like I said in my post - I wanted a mature team of people because from experience majority of people under the age of 15 or 16 don’t have the life experience to handle scenarios that are most likely to come up, also unlike other private server development teams. Our team work closely together with voIP communications thus people skills are required.<br>
I won’t discuss more on that, I explained to you why I thought it wasn’t quite right for you but I’m going to make you a in game player mod and forum mod and generally moderator status of other sites in the community. Thus making you in effect a global moderator. I like how you hold such maturity for your age and your eager to grasp responsibility. I’m entrusting you with additional moderator powers than the standard moderator in the hope that you will some day prove to be worthy of a full moderator.</p>
<p>Welcome to the team!</p>

<p>How many hours a week do you spend online? 1-3 Hours 3-10 Hours 10-24 Hours 24-50 Hours 50 Hours +<br>
24-50, depending on if I have soccer, or going on vacation.</p>
<p>What previous experience have you had previously in the desired position(s)?<br>
I used to (still kinda of do) run my own forums, alone.  It stayed under pretty good control, never had any big issues I couldn’t resolve.  I enforced the rules of my forum pretty strictly, even banning my Co-Owner at one point because of his constant spam.</p>
<p>What projects online (Private servers, websites, IRC etc) have you been involved with?<br>
I used to run my own Private Server (from 2007 until early this year, now more of a side project to keep old players in touch).  I still do update it, but since I am not to amazing with Java, I don’t do major updates.  I also was moderator of a Vent Server that I used to use for another online game until late last year when I quit the game.</p>
<p>Why do you think we should choose you?<br>
I am always on forums/websites doing something, from trying to help someone, to backing someone up, ect.<br>
I just know a lot about following forum rules (I don’t think I’ve broken any here), and I do my best to help others/keep things clean.</p>
<p>How can you personally make a positive impact on the development team?<br>
I am never much of a put-down, unless someone is acting like a complete retard and messing things up.  I try to encourage people, but that doesn’t always work out according to plan. Sorry, applying for what I did, I wasn’t really sure what I could do.</p>

<p>How many hours a week do you spend online? 1-3 Hours 3-10 Hours 10-24 Hours 24-50 Hours 50 Hours +<br>
24-50, depending on if I have soccer, or going on vacation.</p>
<p>What previous experience have you had previously in the desired position(s)?<br>
I used to (still kinda of do) run my own forums, alone.  It stayed under pretty good control, never had any big issues I couldn’t resolve.  I enforced the rules of my forum pretty strictly, even banning my Co-Owner at one point because of his constant spam.</p>
<p>What projects online (Private servers, websites, IRC etc) have you been involved with?<br>
I used to run my own Private Server (from 2007 until early this year, now more of a side project to keep old players in touch).  I still do update it, but since I am not to amazing with Java, I don’t do major updates.  I also was moderator of a Vent Server that I used to use for another online game until late last year when I quit the game.</p>
<p>Why do you think we should choose you?<br>
I am always on forums/websites doing something, from trying to help someone, to backing someone up, ect.<br>
I just know a lot about following forum rules (I don’t think I’ve broken any here), and I do my best to help others/keep things clean.</p>
<p>How can you personally make a positive impact on the development team?<br>
I am never much of a put-down, unless someone is acting like a complete retard and messing things up.  I try to encourage people, but that doesn’t always work out according to plan. Sorry, applying for what I did, I wasn’t really sure what I could do.</p>

<p>How many hours a week do you spend online? 1-3 Hours 3-10 Hours 10-24 Hours 24-50 Hours 50 Hours +<br>
Seeing as I have an online job, I am on 24-50, maybe 50+ hours a week. I’m a computer freak. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>What previous experience have you had previously in the desired position(s)? I currently work for an up and coming company, we will specialize in hosting, as well as developing products such as email clients, and eventually cellular technology. It is called Techo. We are currently working on opening. I am a programmer, as well as customer support and General Manager. I have an area of expertise in mainly HTML programming, but I know Java as well. If you needed, I can help programming the server. I am great with people, seeing as I’m in customer support, as well as management. I think I qualify greatly for all of the positions I checked.</p>
<p>What projects online (Private servers, websites, IRC etc) have you been involved with? Well, I’m involved with Techo, which was mentioned above. I coded and hosted my own server, called Cookiescape, but had to shut it down due to funding being a problem. I currently program, as well as administrate a server, it is currently up, so I won’t post the link. I don’t want to get busted for advertising. It is currently in the V1 stage, and is awful, but I’m finishing V2, and it will be darn near fantastic. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Anyways, I put together most of the forums for this server myself, it is vBulletin, with a domain name and everything, if you want a link, just Private Message me, or email me at my work email, listed above. I’ve also programmed various servers. None you would know, so I won’t mention them.</p>
<p>Why do you think we should choose you? I’m obviously a mature person, who is MORE than qualified for these jobs. While being serious, I also have a great sense of humor, and get along with people really well. I never abuse my authorities. I am also very dedicated to things I’m working on. The server I’m working on has been out for a month and I have over 1,000 posts on the forums, and I don’t spam. I’m not one of those people that half-asses everything. I work hard.</p>
<p>How can you personally make a positive impact on the development team? I think everything I’ve listed above tells you how I would make a positive impact on your servers development team. I think your site is great, and your server has some great potential. I look forward to getting a response.</p>

Seeing as I have an online job, I am on 24-50, maybe 50+ hours a week. I’m a computer freak. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>What previous experience have you had previously in the desired position(s)? I currently work for an up and coming company, we will specialize in hosting, as well as developing products such as email clients, and eventually cellular technology. It is called Techo. We are currently working on opening. I am a programmer, as well as customer support and General Manager. I have an area of expertise in mainly HTML programming, but I know Java as well. If you needed, I can help programming the server. I am great with people, seeing as I’m in customer support, as well as management. I think I qualify greatly for all of the positions I checked.</p>
<p>What projects online (Private servers, websites, IRC etc) have you been involved with? Well, I’m involved with Techo, which was mentioned above. I coded and hosted my own server, called Cookiescape, but had to shut it down due to funding being a problem. I currently program, as well as administrate a server, it is currently up, so I won’t post the link. I don’t want to get busted for advertising. It is currently in the V1 stage, and is awful, but I’m finishing V2, and it will be darn near fantastic. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Anyways, I put together most of the forums for this server myself, it is vBulletin, with a domain name and everything, if you want a link, just Private Message me, or email me at my work email, listed above. I’ve also programmed various servers. None you would know, so I won’t mention them.</p>
<p>Why do you think we should choose you? I’m obviously a mature person, who is MORE than qualified for these jobs. While being serious, I also have a great sense of humor, and get along with people really well. I never abuse my authorities. I am also very dedicated to things I’m working on. The server I’m working on has been out for a month and I have over 1,000 posts on the forums, and I don’t spam. I’m not one of those people that half-asses everything. I work hard.</p>
<p>How can you personally make a positive impact on the development team? I think everything I’ve listed above tells you how I would make a positive impact on your servers development team. I think your site is great, and your server has some great potential. I look forward to getting a response.</p>

I managed around 200 live support calls in 3 days and also around 100 in-game issues in those 3 days. I have owned my own servers 3 times. (haven’t gotten big). I have been mod and coder on one of my friends servers… (CryPk).</p>
<p>What projects online (Private servers, websites, IRC etc) have you been involved with? I have worked with 3 servers of my own and one of my friends they are… CryPk (mine)(2 different versions)  TragicX (mine) and ghostscape (friends). I have done online work with html, php, and cc on my own website… <a href="http://crypk.smfnew.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Crypk.smfnew.com</a> and some on my friends.</p>
<p>Why do you think we should choose you? The reason why i think you should choose me is because i probably have most experience with talking to people. I have a great personality. I was a loved ref because when we were all in the vent server i would answer questions that other refs had and i hope i can do that for your server. I have owned my own servers and worked a lot on other servers as well!</p>
<p>How can you personally make a positive impact on the development team? Well the way i can make a positive impact on the development team is just bring along my personality and hard work to it. I will help out anyone and everyone that needs help and im sure you guys won’t need a lot (sence i read some of the applications) but i am one of the most positive people you will ever meet!</p>

<p>Applying for:<br>
Java Coder</p>
<p>How many hours a week do you spend online? 1-3 Hours 3-10 Hours 10-24 Hours 24-50 Hours 50 Hours +<br>
24-50 hours<br>
What previous experience have you had previously in the desired position(s)?</p>
<p>I have been coding for almost 2 years now. ive perfected skilling, poisoning systems, minigames, Animations in client, and more. I can almost fix any bug/dupe on server.  I’ve added many animations that many people love on their clients. many items that are in RS with correct anims. and GFX’s for skills (such as thieving) Emotes for skills (such as herblore, fishing, and thieving)</p>
<p>What projects online (Private servers, websites, IRC etc) have you been involved with?<br>
Waleedscape, Rune-Fusion (not davidi2) Project OME<br>
Why do you think we should choose you?<br>
Because, im 1 of those people who are young, learned java in school, and still have a fresh memory.<br>
I may not be chosen, that is your choice, but i think u should choose me, because most people who play RSPS and recently quit RS, loved to skill, with bug-free emotes, and non glitched. Or, like to have the items they couldnt have in RS, in RSPS clients, like to have the same animations as RS in an RSPS. No dupes, no bugs, no glitches.</p>
<p>How can you personally make a positive impact on the development team?<br>
I personally think that i could make an impact in this development team:<br>
So the other Java coders dont have to struggle removing bugs from skills, or yet even adding them.<br>
So they dont get confused how to add custom ints without getting errors.<br>
So they dont mistakingly add the incorrect GFX’s, or animations for skilling, combat.<br>
And, most importantly, so they can focus on they’re part and not a confusing part</p>
