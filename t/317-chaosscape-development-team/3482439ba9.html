<li>As for Customer Support, I have been in different types of moderation positions in the past, whether in-game support, or forum/live support.  I know how to react in tight situations, and am quite social when it comes to helping in that sort of a role.</li>

Seems like you are all dedicated with this project, and I really do want to be a part of it.</li>

<p>We do require staff/developers to have MSN It’s how we collaborate our work. But I’ve got to go to school now for 3 lessons so I’ll get back to you when I get home. Try and get MSN to work, I could probably work out the problem if you can’t.<br>

<p>Does yahoo support the MSN group chat? Not the normal group chat but the ‘group’ group chat if that makes any sense… its the group where you can join and part the chat at any time.</p>
