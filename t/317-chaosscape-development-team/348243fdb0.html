Age: 15, 2 months till im 16<br>
Country of residence: I live in he United Kingdom<br>
Email: <a href="mailto:xholyskillsx@hotmail.com">xholyskillsx@hotmail.com</a><br>
MSN: <a href="mailto:xholyskillsx@hotmail.com">xholyskillsx@hotmail.com</a></p>
<p>Applying for: I’m applying for In-game Moderator</p>
<p>How many hours a week do you spend online? I spend whole day Online.</p>
<p>What previous experience have you had previously in the desired position(s)? I’ve been a Player Moderator in Runescape for about 2 years, I quited Runescape and informed Jagex through Player Moderator centre that i chosen to be De-moded.</p>
<p>What projects online (Private servers, websites, IRC etc) have you been involved with? I was involved with few projects which include:<br>
Generation-x private server and forums, I been chosen by the owner to become a Player Moderator but after proving my self to him and other players i been granted a Administrator status. I’ve been also in development team on the Forums i was making improvements until owner of generation-x decided to ruin the game by giving it free-spawns etc. I decided to quit generation-x after that and moved onto other servers not so big but still good.</p>
<p>Why do you think we should choose you? First of all I have a good communication with players and not only on in-game but also outside it which include: Forums, Msn , Ventrilo. I’m one of not many people which play not for the Status in-game but for he fun and for other people to have fun on it as well, I’ve been a Runescape Player Moderator which this whole idea came from, I thought to my self this would be a new start. I have a massive experience in being a Staff Member im a person which will have punishment  for players and will speak to the rule breaker that would deserve desired punishment.</p>
<p>How can you personally make a positive impact on the development team?<br>
I will have a huge impact on the ‘Development Team’ which i could name for really long time.<br>
The impact i will be showing you but also the community will be following: Good grammar is one of the most important when your working for a Server and Forums like yours. I’m a really opened person to everyone i tolerate everyone but everyone has a limit which i have but i have to say is long but not for Rule Breakers. I have all you was asking for as you named on the ‘All staff are required to know how to:’ I’m also styding I.C.T Managment i can proudly say that my grades are always at the end of each year: B, B+, I also got 2- A’s.</p>

<span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">What previous experience have you had previously in the desired position(s)?</span></span> Some previous experience that I have is, beta testing on some servers. I have helped many members from various servers on how to work some of the features on a server. I have coded my own server as well, but I couldn’t get a team together to help me. I’m looking for something else to do besides code a server and test out a server all by myself.</p>

If you tell me to do something, or I’m given a date to finish something it will be finished. I am reliable and I’m trust worthy which is why you should choose me.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">How can you personally make a positive impact on the development team?</span></span> I can help sort out some problems that various people are having and I can find an area that fits me best. I will help test out the server, will help out members/staff, and will keep on going. I will never stop trying my best and will make sure that everyone knows what their doing, and make sure I know what I’m doing as well. There will never be a moment where I’m off topic or not focusing on the development team.</p>

<p>Applying for: I’m applying for In-game Moderator</p>
<p>How many hours a week do you spend online? I spend whole day Online.</p>
<p>What previous experience have you had previously in the desired position(s)? I’ve been a Player Moderator in Runescape for about 2 years, I quited Runescape and informed Jagex through Player Moderator centre that i chosen to be De-moded.</p>
<p>What projects online (Private servers, websites, IRC etc) have you been involved with? I was involved with few projects which include:<br>
Generation-x private server and forums, I been chosen by the owner to become a Player Moderator but after proving my self to him and other players i been granted a Administrator status. I’ve been also in development team on the Forums i was making improvements until owner of generation-x decided to ruin the game by giving it free-spawns etc. I decided to quit generation-x after that and moved onto other servers not so big but still good.</p>
<p>Why do you think we should choose you? First of all I have a good communication with players and not only on in-game but also outside it which include: Forums, Msn , Ventrilo. I’m one of not many people which play not for the Status in-game but for he fun and for other people to have fun on it as well, I’ve been a Runescape Player Moderator which this whole idea came from, I thought to my self this would be a new start. I have a massive experience in being a Staff Member im a person which will have punishment  for players and will speak to the rule breaker that would deserve desired punishment.</p>
<p>How can you personally make a positive impact on the development team?<br>
I will have a huge impact on the ‘Development Team’ which i could name for really long time.<br>
The impact i will be showing you but also the community will be following: Good grammar is one of the most important when your working for a Server and Forums like yours. I’m a really opened person to everyone i tolerate everyone but everyone has a limit which i have but i have to say is long but not for Rule Breakers. I have all you was asking for as you named on the ‘All staff are required to know how to:’ I’m also styding I.C.T Managment i can proudly say that my grades are always at the end of each year: B, B+, I also got 2- A’s.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">I am willing to take on any position , as I am able to work in any of the development team spots. If you need help I’m there for you, and I will be able to accomplish anything you want me to.</span></span></p>

<span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">What previous experience have you had previously in the desired position(s)?</span></span> Some previous experience that I have is, beta testing on some servers. I have helped many members from various servers on how to work some of the features on a server. I have coded my own server as well, but I couldn’t get a team together to help me. I’m looking for something else to do besides code a server and test out a server all by myself.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">What projects online (Private servers, websites, IRC etc) have you been involved with?</span></span><br>
I have been involved with <a href="http://www.lostpkz.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.lostpkz.org</a>, www.holypkingscape.tk, RuneBlockReborn , and some other various servers and websites.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Why do you think we should choose you?</span></span> I think you should choose me cause I’ll try my best at whatever position I get. I do spend a lot of time on the computer which many people may know. I will always stay active, stick to what I’m doing and will stay on top of everything. If you tell me to do something, or I’m given a date to finish something it will be finished. I am reliable and I’m trust worthy which is why you should choose me.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">How can you personally make a positive impact on the development team?</span></span> I can help sort out some problems that various people are having and I can find an area that fits me best. I will help test out the server, will help out members/staff, and will keep on going. I will never stop trying my best and will make sure that everyone knows what their doing, and make sure I know what I’m doing as well. There will never be a moment where I’m off topic or not focusing on the development team.</p>

What do you want for the proof that I have worked / coded / helped out on a server? I can take a picture of me being staff or something on a server? I can maybe take a screen shot of a duel arena I coded. What else would you want?<br>
[/quote]Please provide a detailed script of some sort that you have written yourself.<br>
The script must serve some type of function.</p>
<p>All variables used must be declared, and the script can cause no errors.<br>
Conventions are up to you.</p>
<p>Also, the code must be explained, showing you know what it does.[/quote]</p>
<p>So basically I have to make a whole tutorial on a topic that most people already know. Like how to create a duel arena or something like that. Also, can I ask why I am proving I code when I signed up for various positions that do not contain coding. I also stated that I wasn’t the best coder but I would try to do my best in whatever you give me.</p>

<p>So basically I have to make a whole tutorial on a topic that most people already know. Like how to create a duel arena or something like that. Also, can I ask why I am proving I code when I signed up for various positions that do not contain coding. I also stated that I wasn’t the best coder but I would try to do my best in whatever you give me.[/quote]</p>
<p>No. Prove that you created a script (class file or a portion of code). Explain it. This can be done through the comments in the code.</p>
<p>P.s. I was never updated on whether I could join or not. You guys only had me add Carter’s MSN. (I cannot stay in the group chat due to an MSN connection issue)</p>

<p>Well, if you want proof other than a script visit my site and ask everyone if I’m a good scripter/coder if you like <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
