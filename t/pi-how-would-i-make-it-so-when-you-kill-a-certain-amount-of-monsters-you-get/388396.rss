Yes it is quite simple…maybe you can learn some JAVA? or at least attempt by yourself or post an idea on how you would attempt it.<br>

<p>I don’t see anywhere in his post he stated or even implyed he was perfect, take your own advice and get over yourself and stop being so snide. He’s simply stating you should learn java and practice before you come asking for help. This section is to ask for help when you’re in desperate need of help, not for it to be abused and came to for every little problem you come across.</p>

<p>Yea I am so full of myself because I know basic java (and that is all I know :P)<br>
Suggesting to him to learn java is a lot better then tossing him some code snippets he does not know what to do with them.</p>
