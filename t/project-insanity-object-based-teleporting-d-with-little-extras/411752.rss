    <title>Project Insanity : Object based teleporting :D (with little extras)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-insanity-object-based-teleporting-d-with-little-extras/411752</link>
    <description>[b]NOTE[/b] : This was done out of pure boredom , I just like using Objects better so I thought I might try it :D

[b]UPDATED[/b] : I&#39;ve made some changes , including the gwd kc resetting (to give you guys an example) and also the Lunar spellbook (I don&#39;t have it personally , but I&#39;ve made it so that the code will recognize it).
This is for as long as the Lunar spell book int for the [b]c.playerMagicBook[/b] variable is set to [b]2[/b].

I will try to explain this as best as I can...
What this does is add a new way of teleporting.
The mechanics are completely the same , but it&#39;s now being handled as an object , like so :

[code=java]new Teleport(c, 3212, 3423, 0);[/code]
(That&#39;s how you call the code once you&#39;ve added it)
The c stands for the Client , so it changes to whatever you named it.
The 3 integers stand for the X , Y and Z coordinates of the location you want to teleport to.

[b]SO LET&#39;S START[/b]

First of all , you&#39;re going to have to create a new class called [b]Teleport.java[/b] in the [i]server.model.players[/i] package.

Now , you have to add this code in that class :
[code=java]package server.model.players;

import server.model.players.Client;
import server.Config;
import server.util.Misc;

public class Teleport {
	
	private int playX;
	private int playY;
	private int playZ;
	private int futX;
	private int futY;
	private int futZ;

	public Teleport(Client c, int newX, int newY, int newZ) { //1

		}
	}
	
	/*Grabs the player&#39;s coords from the moment he clicked a teleport and stores it incase they change*/
	public void getPlayerCoords(Client c) {
		playX = c.absX;
		playY = c.absY;
		playZ = c.heightLevel;
	}
	
	/*Performs checks to see if the player is allowed to teleport , add custom changes here if you want*/
	public boolean canTeleport(Client c) {
		if (c.duelStatus == 5) {
			c.sendMessage(&quot;You can&#39;t teleport during a duel!&quot;);
			return false;
		}
		if (c.inWild() &amp;&amp; c.wildLevel &gt; Config.NO_TELEPORT_WILD_LEVEL) {
			c.sendMessage(&quot;You can&#39;t teleport above level &quot;+Config.NO_TELEPORT_WILD_LEVEL+&quot; in the wilderness.&quot;);
			return false;
		}
		if (System.currentTimeMillis() - c.teleBlockDelay &lt; c.teleBlockLength) {
			c.sendMessage(&quot;You are teleblocked and can&#39;t teleport.&quot;);
			return false;
		}
		return true;
	}
}[/code]

Now to explain how this works...
*takes a deep breath*

1) The class gets initiated , the specified coordinates of the target location and the Client representing the player are given as an input.

2) The [b]getPlayerCoords(c)[/b] method memorizes the player&#39;s coordinates BEFORE the teleport , these coordinates will be used in the [b]handleLeaveEffects(c, playX, playY, playZ)[/b] method.

3) Checks if the player is capable of teleporting.
This checks for things like dueling , wether the player is dead or not , wildy levels , etc.

4) Now , the [b]handleLeaveEffects(c, playX, playY, playZ)[/b] method will see if you were in an area where teleporting is allowed , but comes with an event afterwards.
Much like Godwars ; if you are in godwars for example and you teleport out your killcount will reset.
You can use the [b]inArea(int x, int y, int x1, int y1)[/b] in the Player class for this.

5) Checks if the player has the regular spellbook

6) checks if the player has the ancients spellbook

Note : the reason why these 2 are different is because of the animations and graphics used.
Those are still being handled in the Client and PlayerAssistant class like they were with the original teleporting.

7) I don&#39;t know why I did this ; It&#39;s just a security check I think.
If the player is somehow on neither the Ancients or Regular spellbook , it will reset to the original spellbook.

[b]NOTE[/b] : I do understand that the Lunar spellbook probably has another value for the [b]c.playerMagicBook[/b] variable , I don&#39;t know if the animations and Graphics for the lunar teleports are the same as those of the original spellbook.
If so , just make the part where the code checks for the original spellbook like this :
[code=java]			if (c.playerMagicBook == 0 || c.playerMagicBook == 2) {
				performRegularTeleport(c, newX, newY, newZ);
			}[/code]
That way the lunar spellbook will be handled the same way as the regular teleports.

[b]EDIT[/b]
I almost forgot , to use this new way of teleporting , you must import the Teleport class like so :
[code=java]import server.model.players.Teleport;[/code]

Cheers guys ,
