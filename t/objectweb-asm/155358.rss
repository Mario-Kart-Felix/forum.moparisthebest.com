          <blockquote>
              <p>I find ASM to be a lot clearer, you don’t have to know what a constant pool is because its all hidden. This means that if you load then dump classes using ASM you strip out redundant constants, foiling protection schemes that regex has a good example of. The disadvantage is that if you want to rename a class you have to loop through all the instructions but that is not such a big deal. It pays off when you don’t need to have a clue what the index is and if the constant exists in the first place.</p>
<p>ASM uses a visitor based method of reading classes. While this is fine if you were just doing simple operations that don’t involve any more context than the instruction/class declaration that you were reading, for more complex things you need to uses ClassNode. Here is some code that loads classes from a jar file into classnodes. It shouldn’t use a Vector since that class has been superseded by ArrayList but I’m lazy:</p>
<p><code>	public static ClassNode[] loadClassesFromJar(File jarFile) throws Exception {
		Vector&lt;ClassNode&gt; cns = new Vector&lt;ClassNode&gt;();
		ZipInputStream zipis = new ZipInputStream(
					new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(jarFile)));
		ZipEntry zipentry = null;
		while ((zipentry = zipis.getNextEntry()) != null) {
			String s = zipentry.getName();
			if (!s.endsWith(".class")) continue;
			ClassReader cr = new ClassReader(zipis);
			ClassNode cn = new ClassNode();
			cr.accept(cn, 0);
			cns.add(cn);
		}
		return cns.toArray(new ClassNode[0]);
	}</code><br>
I find it easier as it hides all the crap in classfiles. All you really need to know is some basic knowledge on java and how a method descriptor is constructed: (Ljava/lang/String;)V</p>
<p>It also includes an analyzer which, although in its current form takes 20sec or so on my 2.4Ghz(single core) machine, proved invaluable with removing a whole bunch of crap. I have since shaved this down to 5sec or so by making SourceValue mutable but this is just an ePenis fight.</p>
<p>The only thing I found laking was no pattern matching using regular expressions. It was relatively easy to port the pattern matcher class and add increased functionality, see below.</p>
<p>I also found a few bugs in BCEL, for example one of the iterators does not return the last element of the instruction list, so I decided to use a tried and tested API that is actually updated. BCEL was last updated in 2001 or something like that. I find it annoying how you can have instructions that are targeted, resulting in exceptions and more code. ASM has label nodes, when you are pattern matching rather than having to deal with the obscure case that an instruction in your pattern has been targeted, you can simply not match that sequence of instructions.</p>
