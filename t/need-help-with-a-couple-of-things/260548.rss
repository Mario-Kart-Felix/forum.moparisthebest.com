    <description>NOTE: I AM USING A DELTASCAPE BASED SOURCE.

1. I was wondering how you would add pk points.  so that if you kill someone you recieve 2 pk points.  If you kill the same person 2 times then you dont get any pk points.

when you get pk points i want it to sendmessage

Playername has killed playername and now has x pk points.


2. I was wondering how to change a part of the wild (mage bank) and make it multi so you can team on people.  i know i need to search isinwild in my player.java but i dont know what to do from there.</description>
