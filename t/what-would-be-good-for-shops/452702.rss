<p>You’ve actually got me thinking about it. Getting armor drops would be great, and could be the good source of money.</p>

<p>Rune and addy are fine, why would you want someone to work for them? Unless it’s the cash they need to work for to get it.</p>

              <p>The only shops I actually advice you add are ones that include armor up to rune and possibly a few dragon weapons. When it comes to skill supplies, limit the items players can purchase. I would recommend only having things like seeds, tools, and a few gems. Keep in mind of things that are ‘want’ items and things that are required to train something.</p>
