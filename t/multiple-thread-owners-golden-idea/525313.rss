    <title>Multiple thread owners - Golden idea</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/multiple-thread-owners-golden-idea/525313</link>
    <description>Personally I think this idea is amazing, and it just came to mind. If you don&#39;t feel the same way that&#39;s fine, leave constructive criticism and we&#39;ll see what everyone thinks. Anyways enough of the intro, now to the idea:

So how about an option while creating a new thread that allows the creator of the thread give multiple &#39;edit&#39; permissions to several people. It&#39;s like 3:18 am so if that babbling didn&#39;t make any sense to you, let me just say it in example form.

Let&#39;s say (real scenario) me and Ares_ are developing a server and we post a thread in the server development thread. Ares is offline for a day and I may wanna add a poll/edit some things on the main thread. Well I can&#39;t do that until he gets back, which is frustrating to me, because it&#39;s really important. This can all be made possible if he grants me &#39;edit&#39; permissions in the thread. Now whether SMF limits this to being possible or not, I think it&#39;s worth a shot. I&#39;m just gonna leave a nice little poll on top for you users to vote on.</description>

Also, another point:<br>
So lets say this went through. You post a server advert or whatever. Someone on the team edits the post and adds something that’s against the rules. Then you edit the topic for an update. You didn’t see the bad content, but it now says you were the last one to edit, and not your partner. The post gets reported. A staff see’s the report log, reads it, and infracts you accordingly. You login and see you’ve been infracted for what looked like to be nothing, but turns out it was your teammates fault. gg.<br>
[/quote]Considering this would only be enabled in the development sections, what exactly would a teammate put in that would be breaking the rules? All I can think of would be like an advertisement link, but we don’t infract for those most of the time we just remove it and post telling them they cant advertise in development topics.[/quote]<br>
It’s just a scenario.</p>

For the vast majority of users, it won’t. With that in mind, administrator time is better spent elsewhere.</p>

<p>You’re joking right? While the “no multiple accounts” rule still exists, they’ve been more lenient on the rule itself because people use the secondary account for advertising, etc. The point of that rule was so you don’t make 2 accounts to constantly bump your own topic (Or, that’s how it’s enforced now).</p>

<p>Oh. So you’re telling me you’ve never seen a development team add a person onto the team, whom they thought they can trust, and then when they get removed they do something like: releasing the server/client, trashing the server in some way, or giving the server a bad rep?<br>
It happens all. the. time. Not everyone takes getting “fired” lightly.</p>
