    <title>Any good C++ Books?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/any-good-c-books/40479</link>
    <description>Hello!

My primary source of learning C++ have been the internet but I&#39;d like a book as well.
Books are good as you can read them when you don&#39;t have a computer available.
So my question is: Do anyone know a good book about C++?
I know pretty much, but anyways, any good book about C++ will do.

Thanks in advance,</description>
