    <title>New best game?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-best-game/541271</link>
    <description>I have been wanting a survivor game for a long time and nothing has been out that is good.
My Idea: Using the RS client and current items we can make a server like no other. 
When you start out you still have all stats but the goal is to survive. 
You can buy land build a house or castle or what ever.
Whole new quests system:
Type of quests:
Building,Combat,Crafting ect. So you can unlock new building mat and new ways to fight ect.. 
You can build up an army with friends by starting a guild, New guild system way better that before kinda like wows but revamped.
Make a city. The world will be much larger than the current RS world. There will be boat travle and you can buy or rent boats. 
Nothing modern still takes place in the RS times.

There is a lot more about this project but don&#39;t want to share everything.

I&#39;m looking for a few people who can help out with this project.

we can set up a time to skype.</description>
