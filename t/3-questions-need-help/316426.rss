    <title>3 questions need help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/3-questions-need-help/316426</link>
    <description>1. Whenever I make a shop and wanneshop and go into my server (playing it) and click on the shop, nothing happens. Also there is 2 wanneshop things in my client.java. Do I make 2 wanneshops? A tut on how to make a shop would be great. I have autospawned npc ID 520 and I made a wanneshop for 520 and I made a shop for wanneshop = 42. HELP PLEASE!

2. My entire server is PKing. What is the boolean nonwild code you guys have?

3. Im using Phonescape server source. How do I create items like a mining rock and a crate? Createglobalobject?
Thanks you guys!</description>
