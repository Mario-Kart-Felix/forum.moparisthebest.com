    <title>SLOMISCAPE USERS : READ THIS! This will help better improve the server</title>

    <description>(Someone told me to move it here, cant remember who.)

(I honestly have no idea which section I am supposed to post this in, but this is a question, so I posted it here!)

AGAIN, THIS IS FOR SLOMISCAPE USERS! DONT POST UNLESS YOU ARE A PART OF MY SERVER!, OR IF YOU DONT HAVE SOMETHING VALUABLE TO SAY!

I have had numerous complaints because my server has a lack of commands and functions.

I have started this thread so all those complainers can get my attention!

Post any suggestions you may have, but keep in mind the following points:

1. I WILL NOT add free item commands. I may add commands that require money to use, but that&#39;s a separate argument

2. Currently, Im having problems with -fedexer-&#39;s global object adder; I get this error that says that it has already been stated, but it hasn&#39;t, so Im working on it :p.

3. Keep the just of point 1 in mind always. I have experienced  this in other servers: servers that have free item commands are filled with rich people who used very little effort to get to where the are.

(Sorry if this thread screams &quot;LOCK ME!&quot;, but I&#39;ve had enough whining, so here it is...</description>
