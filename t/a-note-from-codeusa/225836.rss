    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-note-from-codeusa/225836</link>
    <description>Hello i may not be one of the top &#39;posters here&#39; but why is it if. A member of this fourm tells a moderator or admin off they are banned? because has you may know Codeusa was banned last night for no reason and i would like to know why he was really what did he do that was so wrong? well i say sign for a un ban because all he did was try and help this community and treated every member has a equal and. He gets banned all he liked to do is post and now he can&#39;t because his favorite banned him so sign if you want codeusa back with

/sign

Please bring codeusa back he was going to release ajscape unleased to moparscape but now he is not because of this so sign please bring him back. we know the moderators will all out ban and mute and admin do not care because they think they run the place but try and bring him back.

Ajscape unleased was this

Other who where warned and punished because moderators don&#39;t like what we have to say

matrix pride(moderation) for nothing

reeper X warned for spam? i have read all his post where is the spam

written blade moderation show me the spam?

and Jme posted gay  spam and DID NOT GET NOTHING!!!
codeusa for ban = SPAM
jme posted that = spam

matrix pride = moderatoed for taking up for someone</description>

              <p>You want him unbanned just because he was going to release ajscape ? LOL<br>
w/e I don’t think this will help, it may even worse his chances…<br>
I was going to un-ban him just because he is my friend</p>

              <p>Tbh, codeusa was one of the biggest spammers ive seen here in a while.  He also had a tendancy to argue with everything, instead of working with it.  As far as I see, he deserved the ban.  If he told a mod off, he probably flamed the mod to hell and back.  And if I am not mistaken isn’t that against the rules now?  And this is spam also.  Your walking down codeusa’s path.  Please, before it’s to late, take the next exit off that path.</p>
