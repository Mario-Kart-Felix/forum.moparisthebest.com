    <title>I need help please. *2 problems* NPC direction,NPC damage</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-please-2-problems-npc-direction-npc-damage/217739</link>
    <description>I am using a ziddy based source, and I am tring to change it completely. On my way to doing this I came across two things I need help with.

1. Is there any way to change which direction a trade npc is facing? Mine are always facing north and there is nothing in the autospawn.cfg to change to make them look a different way. *Just need to know what file and what to change*

2. Is there anyway to change how high a npc is hitting? My NPC.cfg only has two colums.. Combat and Health. 

If you could help and lead me in the right direction I would be greatful, thanks.</description>
