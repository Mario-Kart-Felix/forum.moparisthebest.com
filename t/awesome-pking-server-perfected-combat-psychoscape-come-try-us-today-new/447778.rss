hey moparscape, ive recently opened my server ive been messing with the hit system accuracy and power and certain weapon animations etc. they are all 100% perfected!

We have full skilling, but who want&#39;s to skill on a RSPS? and who wants stupid custom items like, Lime whips...or Bronze Partyhats?...lol this is mainly made for players who refuse to play the new updated rs with the new combat coming out, etc. im old school and i wanted to keep it how it was before all the stupid stuff came out. so if your a pker come play our server today ;)

<p>The exact reason why servers basically suck today.  Most of the owners are pkers and think everyone shares their opinion.  I personally love to skill, even in servers, and custom items make the gameplay more interesting, i.e when pking, you have to take in more than “whip vs godsword”.</p>
<p>Not a whole lot that came out was stupid if you look at it.  The HD support was actually really good, summoning was great, dungeoneering would have been great as a minigame, etc.  Besides, even if you don’t lke it, rather than just saying “Stupidest fucking shit ever, I quit rs, dung is gay”, just don’t play it and respect those who enjoy it?</p>
