    <title>Looking for a coding partner</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-coding-partner/519740</link>
    <description>Hello, I am looking for someone to code for me. I do not have much experience in java coding. I am looking for a partner to help me create a revision 508+(Not anything out of the 600s) PK server. I do have experience in html and css. I have all the finances for the server. We would own the server 50/50. I am looking for a partner that is very experienced in custom coding and fixing bugs. I do not want someone that says she/he is a coder because they can edit java code. I can edit java code myself. I need an experienced coder that is looking for a serious server. 

Minimum requirements for the coder:

1. Have coded on a server before
2. Being able to talk on skype
3. Being open to ideas and criticism.
4. Able to create a PK Ticket system.
5. Custom coding, and fixing any bugs that we may have.

Things I would provide:
1. A website with a donate system.
2. A dedicated VPS
3. Ideas for the server
4. I can also help with anything trivial in the server ( Finding cordinates, placing npcs, creating shops) 
5. Any other finances we may need.

You can contact me on here, but preferable contact me on skype or by email.
