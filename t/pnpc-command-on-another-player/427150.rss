    <title>::pnpc command, on another player..?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pnpc-command-on-another-player/427150</link>
    <description>Is there a known command already written? Or can someone show me how to implement a command like ::pnpc, but have it so I can set it on other players?

I would like to be able to do this for certain events. 

(Ex. Black Knights VS White Knights)

Thank you in Advance!
