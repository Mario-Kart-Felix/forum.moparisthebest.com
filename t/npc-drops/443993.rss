    <title>NPC drops</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-drops/443993</link>
    <description>Alright, I know this would be my second time asking for this... But yeah, I really need my NPC drops fixed. =\

I have looked everywhere, and I just can&#39;t seem to get them to even work! D:

I&#39;ll provide my Teamviewer information in a message if you&#39;re willing to help me out. :)

I&#39;ve tried everything! Looking at previous post, and everything.. I have personally put out to much time in this source, to just change... So if you could please help me out, that would be fantastic. (:

That, and i&#39;ll rep++ you! :3</description>
