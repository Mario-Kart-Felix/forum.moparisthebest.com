              <p>I was amazed by Frank’s server. Always pointed one direction when you stopped walking though. Jagex even made a teasing remark about it in one of their news posts about how some people were trying and failing (couldn’t even get walking right!) to make private servers. They took down the news article months later to save face though.</p>

<p>Ha, I’ve never thought of doing it like that but that’s really tacky. I’d be interested to know what people have done though, there’s so many ways to achieve the same thing but some not as good as the others.</p>

<p>True. Some ways will work better than others, some may not. Also, there’ll be quite a few things that need editing to make it 100% perfect.</p>
