    <title>Instafashion; not receiving my order. What to do?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/instafashion-not-receiving-my-order-what-to-do/519115</link>
    <description>wattup guys.

My girlfriend purchased some things on instafashion.com like two weeks ago and it hasn&#39;t showed up.  Their email for customer service is fake, and they didn&#39;t email me an tracking number or nothing.  What can I do?  Is there anyway to take legal action?

Here&#39;s a picture of the email sent when i purchased the order:

<p>Do what Niall said. And I know for sure if it was paid on a credit card, they will get the money back for you. If you used paypal, you need to make a claim asap (within 45 days of payment sent)</p>
