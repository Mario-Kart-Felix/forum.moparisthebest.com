L.A. police are under fire pertaining to last week&#39;s shooting involving Margaret Mitchell, a 5-foot-1-inch, 102-pound displaced woman. Police say your woman lunged at an officer having a screwdriver after this individual stopped to ask in the event that her shopping cart has been stolen.Compton School Board member Basil Kimbrew affirms, &quot;We want some type of proper rights, we want understanding, you want to know why! Precisely why! Why! Why does one shot destroy one innocent homeless woman?&quot;A makeshift shrine signifies the spot where Mitchell, the college-educated woman who acquired fallen victim for you to mental illness, has been shot. Her demise comes on the high heel sandals of the killing associated with Tyisha Miller, a 19-year-old black woman who was photo at 23 periods by Riverside police. People say she pointed the gun at them.Neighborhood activist Earl Ofari Hutchinson says, &quot;When would it be gonna end? What i&#39;m saying is, it seems like every week you can not turn around when there&#39;s not something happening.&quot;Crime will be down nationally and lots of credit that to President Clinton&#39;s efforts to place 100,000 brand-new police officers on the pavement. But some say their own inexperience can have dangerous consequences.John Crew, of the ACLU&#39;s Police Methods Project, says, &quot;We have been in the midst of the unprecedented police infant boom. We have thrown officers on the street throughout great numbers with no making sure we have the accountability mechanisms set up with the power to affect the problem.&quot;Police organizations reject the claim that there exists a national epidemic regarding police brutality. Gilbert Gallegos, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, claims, &quot;People think we&#39;re on the market brutalizing people. That&#39;s not the case. Ninety-nine percent involving officers want to do an excellent job.&quot; Shut, but even if there exists a growing problem, police officers wouldn&#39;t know about it.

Jerusalem is simply a half-hour&#39;s drive away.Israelis want to gamble, and this is the one casino they have with regard to hundreds of miles in almost any direction. Still, keeping them come to Palestinian territory for any big night out feels like a bit of a long chance.The casino mixes into the biblical city about as well as a spacecraft from Mars. Jericho is a poor, agricultural backwater, and has recently been since time immemorial. It&#39;s a place where international high-rollers really are a distinctly scarce product. Townspeople desperately need the careers the casino delivers, but there is opposition.The particular operators say they&#39;ve got built casinos within stranger spots.

The CBS News Governmental Unit is monitoring the political advertisements of the presidential hopefuls. Steve Chaggaris analyzes the latest effort of Republican George W. Plant. DEBATE The Advertisement: Debate contrasts George W. Bush&#39;s tax-cut ideas using Sen. John McCain&#39;s, without specifically mentioning McCain&#39;s name. The 30-second commercial is broadcast only in Nh.Audio: Bush: &quot;There&#39;s the debate in Nh on taxes critical to America. We can minimize taxes for operating families and protect Social Security, however it takes leadership. Wa politicians want to maintain money in Washington. Certainly not me. I believe taxes are too high. The people of New Hampshire understand that an individual deserve your money back which cutting taxes will keep the economy developing. On February 1st, you compromise the debate: tax reductions or bigger authorities. I&#39;d appreciate your political election.&quot;Visual: The ad opens up with Bush, put on a casual shirt, talking with the camera. About halfway through the ad, shots of Bush campaigning and also shaking hands tend to be mixed in. Bush ends with an appeal with regard to votes.Fact Check out: No inaccuracies.The tactic: Debate is targeted to be able to New Hampshire voters, who experience strongly about the duty issue. The state happens to be one of only two in the united kingdom with no state earnings or sales taxes. The ad represents an escalation in the Bush-McCain argument on taxes, that the two campaigns are already focusing on in Nh. In order to distinguish himself from McCain, Bush characterizes his opponent as a &quot;Washington politician&quot; for you to appeal to the region&#39;s libertarian, &quot;live free or die&quot; voters along with independents attracted to McCain&#39;s anti-establishment image.
