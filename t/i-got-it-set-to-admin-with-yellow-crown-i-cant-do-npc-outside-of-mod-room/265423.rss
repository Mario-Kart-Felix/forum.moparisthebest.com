          <blockquote>
              <p>it should be something like</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(player.getLocation().inModRoom()) {
        System.out.println("you can not use this command in the mod room");
}</code></pre>
<p>and it needs to be this if you want admins to only be able to use it outside</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(player.getLocation().inModRoom() &amp;&amp; !player.isAdmin()) {
        System.out.println("you can not use this command in the mod room");
}</code></pre>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>LOL i failed so hard. i was thinking about something else <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>adu, i was going to say that but since you said it first Ill tell him.</p>
<p>Look at commandhandler.java and look for the “ifplayerismod” and “playerlocation” remove that from your npc command</p>
