    <title>Building a player base?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/building-a-player-base/548840</link>
    <description>One of my biggest issues when hosting a private server is building a community/player base.

I&#39;ll get tons of clicks/hits, but a good portion don&#39;t join because they see my server is empty. Don&#39;t get me wrong, a couple players come and check it out, but if they don&#39;t see many active players, they too will eventually leave.

What do you guys do to get an active player base, or at least start one to eventually get more players.

I know the basics, like Advertise everywhere, show players the parts of your server that make them want to join, have a catchy advert, be unique, etc.

But obviously it goes a little further than a couple forum posts and some graphics.

So, what are your tips/tricks on getting a player base?</description>

              <p>Frankly I imagine it’s quite easy.<br>
Step 1: Have a product, build some interest in it, but be reasonable - don’t raise everyone’s expectations. If you plan to only release a new feature every fortnight then make this sort of thing clear. Everybody knows what to expect that way.<br>
Step 2: Release it into the wild. Continue to manage expectations and put the level of work into it that you said you would.</p>
<p>If your product is rock-solid (that is, it’s stable and always online) and fun to play then it will speak for itself, and naturally it follows that people will be attracted to it.</p>
<p>I think one of the larger problems with some of the stuff around here is hype and burnout. School students on summer vacation notwithstanding, nobody has the time to work on a server as if it were full time employment. This is why it’s crucial to manage the expectations that people have.<br>
If you set reasonable expectations and then meet them then you can stay in it for the long haul, and that too will attract people to your product.</p>

              <p>I’m not really one to be commenting (seeing as I have a reputation of having servers with a horrible amount of players), but I’ll post anyways.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Developmental Stage</span></p>
<p>I say to <span class="bbcode-b">make a project thread before making your advertisements</span>. I also suggest you make the project thread around 1 month before you plan on making the official release. On your project thread, <span class="bbcode-b">make the release date clear</span>. You’ll shift your hype to that set date. Make it your commitment to <span class="bbcode-b">stick to that date</span>. Why 1 month? Because it shows you are actually progressing. It shows progress and the hype is shifted to the set date that you said.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">The day of release</span></p>
<p>When you release your server, <span class="bbcode-b">do NOT rush to buy advertisements</span>. Buying advertisements is a horrible idea because usually when one clicks an advertisement they expect the server has already been populated and they can join the community, not make the community. This stage is the hardest point. Hook yourself up with people who know many people. Word of mouth is great.</p>
<p>Voting sites should be your aim. You can feel free to buy premium or something on voting sites as those will boost your status on the rankings.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">When you have a <span class="bbcode-b">decent</span> and <span class="bbcode-b">stable</span> playerbase</span></p>
<p>Decent playerbase is you having around 20 players.<br>
Stable playerbase is you maintaining that for a good amount of the day.</p>
<p>At this stage, start buying advertisements.</p>
<p>You now have a <span class="bbcode-i">community</span>.<br>
You now have <span class="bbcode-i">some money</span> to spend from purchases your current playerbase made.<br>
You now have <span class="bbcode-i">the tools to success</span>.</p>

              <p>Like Lare said, building a community before you launch if a good way. Another good way is to good people on YouTube with a decent amount of subscribers to make videos promoting your server. Trust me, it’ll help a lot. I wouldn’t bother with buying ads on a RSPS website, at least the big ones which have them way over priced. Take advantage of top-list and when they reset. If you can get a good amount of votes in when they reset you’ll attract some people.</p>

I’m asking how to establish a player base. You just told me to have a player base to establish one.</p>

              <p>One of my biggest issues when hosting a private server is building a community/player base.</p>
<p>I’ll get tons of clicks/hits, but a good portion don’t join because they see my server is empty. Don’t get me wrong, a couple players come and check it out, but if they don’t see many active players, they too will eventually leave.</p>
<p>What do you guys do to get an active player base, or at least start one to eventually get more players.</p>
<p>I know the basics, like Advertise everywhere, show players the parts of your server that make them want to join, have a catchy advert, be unique, etc.</p>
<p>But obviously it goes a little further than a couple forum posts and some graphics.</p>
<p>So, what are your tips/tricks on getting a player base?</p>
