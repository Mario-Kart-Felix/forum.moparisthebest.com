    <title>Help with pimpscape ( hamachi )</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-pimpscape-hamachi/89463</link>
    <description>Well hello, just wondering if you could help me with hamachi. I have tried and tried but never could get it to work! Im not a computer smart person and was wondering of you could help. Well anyways if posted enough in help threads to figure out that for you to enter your server its 0.0.0.0

127.0.0.1 or your localhost. But I have pimpscape. Okay anyways i registered a no-ip ( i really would settle for a number ip so if you could help me with that it would be great also ) At the top of my hamachi screen it says my ip number. Below it says the name of my no-ip (plutoscape.no-ip.info) I tried putting the ip number, and plutoscape.no-ip.info on the other computer but it didnt work. (i had runserver on and im sure of it) so if you could respond asap that would be great, thanks! - k0 lols on most servers.</description>

              <p>Create a hamachi file on Computer 1.<br>
Then go on Computer 2, and join that.<br>
Make sure your server is on, then on Computer 2 type in Computer 1’s IP… it says next to their hamachi name.</p>
