    <title>I Need Help With -Fedexer-&#39;s TUT!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-fedexer-s-tut/74815</link>
    <description>Hello,

As I&#39;m sure a lot of you know about -Fedexer-&#39;s TUT that he made.  The one about deleting global objects?  Sure you do.  Anyway I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one to have added that to my server because it seems to be pretty popular.

However there is a problem that I, and a few other people, are having trouble with.  After you delete a good amount of World Objects it can create a serious amount of lag.  If anybody has found a solution to this problem, it would be greatly appreciated if you would post the solution.  Please help, because I&#39;m sure that I&#39;m not the only one looking for the answer to this problem!

(BTW -Fedexer- it is a great TUT and I did post on your thread!)</description>
