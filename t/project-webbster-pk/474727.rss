    <description>---------------------------------Currently Looking for help in this project-----------------------------------
------------------The more help given the higher percentage earned from in-game donations-----------------
---------------------------------Coders will receive staff positions in-game if wanted-----------------------
------------------If interested please e-mail me at: freelillou2@gmail.com-----------------------------------


So decided after 2-3 days of running through sources to start my project with Zenith source.
-Ran the source as it was just to get a feel of what I was working with,(testing PvP combat/PvM combat) and so far love the source. Few problems here and there but nothing a little time wont fix. But for the most part overall good source in my opinion. But in the near future would like to get some of my ideas into play after re-coding certain aspects i.e(boss battles such as the kiln,nex,corp etc). 
A few things to start off on the list-
1)Re-code nomad fight,fix the kiln fight, nex needs to be redone.
2)Really need to fix the clipping issue with the npcs walking places unreachable by the player (party pete for 1 example)
3)I would like to implement a group/party aspect for the dungeoneering(not really important  but would like to attempt it)
4)Edit the tormented demons just a tad to lower the attack radius of further NPCs so that your not rushed by every TD in the room and have to attempt to tank either the range or mage being sent in from all angles or just move them further apart(Easy fix)
5)Add teleports or portals at a new home location for easier travelling instead of having to teleport to a close location to get somewhere or look through all the NPCs to see if they take you where you want to go.(Easy)
6)One of my bigger thoughts of adding in the Soul Wars minigame that would almost be Rs-like but not too much like it. Try to add some originality to it if I am able.

But so far just a few of the things I would like to do. And in the coming weeks/months(before february-march) would like to get a team of like-minded coders to help out with the task of getting this server up and running for the public.
I plan on funding the hosting of the server/webpage and would like to help out the people helping me and if the server does what I hope it does, would also like to give 5-10% of in-game donations to the people that have helped make the server into what it is going to be.

Will be looking for coders once i get fully started with project. For now im just mapping out where I want everything to be i.e(home locations, shop locations, new kiln location, coords for npcs/objects etc.)

I will be updating the thread when I accomplish things that are on my personal checklist(in my head).
--Mostly these updates will show my authenticity and originality and that I took the initiative to stand out from the other servers.


//Update 1//  12/20/12
So mapped out where I will be having my shops location as well as the home location.(shops on the penguin iceburg, home will be based in the Security Stronghold level 4 [I like the darkness because it attributes to some of the darker players you will meet in the game {lures, scammers, etc}])
--I also picked the home location due to the 4 doors surrounding the center so that I can place 1 of the 4 alters at the front of each gate leading out(ancient alter, gilded alter, lunar alter, curses alter)
---I picked the iceburg for my shops location due to the size being just big enough for shops but not too much room around it to where people will think theres shops hidden out of plain sight. Plus its a unique location in my opinion.

//Update 2//  12/21/2012
-Home fully complete (altars,respawn,startpoint,bank, etc etc)
--Shops location was scrapped. decided halfway through that i didnt like the area. I might see how right in lumby will do. Then again may put out in the desert somewhere, my freind and I will discuss tomorrow. but the NPCSpawning.java file i noticed was very VERY messy so i went ahead and cleaned out the // out spawn that wer basically stopping the npcspawns from happening.(figured if its not spawning them anyway... might as well trash it)
---Noticed while was pvping with friend on the closed server that Soulsplit isnt working correctly(when damage is dealt your player doesnt receive the health usually followed by said damage) Not really sure how to fix it but Im not 1 to give up so I will be searching around the forums so that I can learn how to and so this problem wont stump me if it ever happens in the future.
----Also noticed that bank booths dont open bank which they should so for now all bank operations are done through bank npcs (clerks) im not really worried about it now because not too big a deal. But if any1 knows a quick fix for this would be helpful to get it out of the way sooner than later. But as i said not too worried about it at the moment.


Thats all for now, more updates soon to come...
