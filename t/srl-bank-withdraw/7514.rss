    <title>SRL Bank Withdraw</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/srl-bank-withdraw/7514</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, 

I&#39;m currently making an alkharid smelter using SRL.

I just started this morning but I&#39;m having a problem with the Withdraw function (withdraw and withdraw2) They both seem to not right click on the actual ore =/, anyone else had thise problem and/or now how to fix it?

I&#39;m thinking of just using a find object function instead now, but if anyone nows a way I could fix the withdraw ones that&#39;d be really helpfull-

Thanks in advance

-1337.


EDIT::: Sorry if this should&#39;ve gone in the other scar help section...</description>
