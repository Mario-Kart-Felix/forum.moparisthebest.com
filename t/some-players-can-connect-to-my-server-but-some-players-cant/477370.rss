    <title>Some players can connect to my server. But some players can&#39;t?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-players-can-connect-to-my-server-but-some-players-cant/477370</link>
    <description>I have a pretty nice server from &#39;insidiaX&#39; now I know what your thinking but no. I have edited a lot in it and mixed in a bit of allstar with it. Anyway I can connect to my server just fine, but the problem is the server client has over 300+ downloaded since it&#39;s release and there have only been over 2 or 3 players on ever! and I went to my friends house to see if my server worked there and he got an error that is &#39;error connecting to server&#39; but then after multiple tries he eventually connected and I think this is what is happening with all the other people that try to connect to my server.

I have a doubt its my internet connection, that&#39;s what I have come to conclude to.

Notes: I don&#39;t have it on a VPS or anything, just on an upstairs computer.

PLEASE HELP ME ANYBODY!!</description>

              <p>Either you have shitty Internet, your router is filtering out certain outbound connections or your server isn’t set up properly. When they try and connect but fail, does it print into your sever command prompt or does it not?</p>

              <p>I have a pretty nice server from ‘insidiaX’ now I know what your thinking but no. I have edited a lot in it and mixed in a bit of allstar with it. Anyway I can connect to my server just fine, but the problem is the server client has over 300+ downloaded since it’s release and there have only been over 2 or 3 players on ever! and I went to my friends house to see if my server worked there and he got an error that is ‘error connecting to server’ but then after multiple tries he eventually connected and I think this is what is happening with all the other people that try to connect to my server.</p>
<p>I have a doubt its my internet connection, that’s what I have come to conclude to.</p>
<p>Notes: I don’t have it on a VPS or anything, just on an upstairs computer.</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP ME ANYBODY!!</p>
