    <title>Ode To Love</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ode-to-love/283334</link>
    <description>This was a poem that I wrote in fifth grade, I just found it, and I kinda like it. Read and comment please. (It may not be the best, since this is from almost 5 years ago.)

[center][u]Ode To Love[/u]
You can be welcoming and pure,
But you can be harmful and corrupt.
You can be simple and plain,
But you can be baffling and convoluted.
You can be flawless and impeccable,
But you can be defective and delusional.
You can show me the path,
But you can be misleading.
You can bring me happiness,
But you aid my downfall.
You can be honest and virtuous,
But you can be deceptive and fraudulent.
You can complete my life,
But you can destroy it too.
How can you be infallible,
But so errant at the same time?
Your presence is so strong,
I cannot ignore it.
I applaud you for having this ability,
The ability to inflict damage,
But also the ability to repair wounds.
I cannot live without you,
Although at times I feel as if I would be better off without you.
I am not sure what to think;
Are you a vital part of my life? Do I need you?[/center]</description>

<p>But, I think what they’re getting at is that it’s hard to believe that most of these words were part of your lexicon in 5th grade. Convoluted, impeccable, and fraudulent are just a few words that I can point out that I know a majority of 5th graders don’t know. You used a thesaurus? It’s common in all writers, even to those who are aware of such words with that high of value.[/quote]<br>
I used a thesaurus for ‘convoluted’. That’s about it. All the other words are ones 5th graders should know…</p>
