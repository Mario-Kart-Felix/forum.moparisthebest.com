    <description>But now I understand after using Vengeance and Goliath gloves ;)

^This is my favorite loot, mainly because it is my first loot worth more than 1M, and the guy said &quot;I hate those gloves&quot; 2 seconds before I veng combo&#39;d him :P

Why do you guys like (or dislike) pking?</description>

I went to hills the other day on my f2p pure, me and another guy met in the wildy and teamed up (it’s like the old days - you don’t get backstabbed!) and went to hills… there were 6 people there. 6! On the closest-to-full f2p world.</p>

<p>“gl?” is easier to type.</p>
<p>Good luck? just means that that person wants to fight. Kind of hard to explain it better.</p>

              <p>I really loved it. Then again I’d probably hate it today. All there was to it was to have Vengeance pre-casted, find a fight, pot, and end the fight in 3 seconds flat with Vengeance. Your biggest concern about a P.J. were Dbowers, but now you have that Korasi and Storm of Armadyl content and what-not. I’d probably get 2-smacked on the level 1 Wilderness line if I tried to P.K. today.</p>

              <p>Kilns easier than learning the fight caves  (non gano method). You stick to certain positions, afk a lot (non melee method) and your done.<br>
Its really not that hard once you know how to do it, you repeat what you know works and can keep doing it again = easy since they spawn in the same location exl har aken itself.<br>
Btw nice loots but if your gonna pk at least bring a lil bit of risk, nobody likes a no risk (250k isn’t risk, when I rune pk I’m risking 600k’ish and thats if I prot whip).</p>
