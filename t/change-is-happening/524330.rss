    <description>[23:03:24] [ChanServ] Foundership transfer from eXemplar to Tom forced by MITB administration.
[23:03:37] &lt;-- eXemplar (exem@dongs.xxx) has left #moparscape
[23:03:37] --&gt; eXemplar (exem@dongs.xxx) has joined #moparscape
[23:03:57] [ChanServ] eXemplar deleted eXemplar from the access list (had role: &lt;Custom&gt;).
[23:04:15] &lt;eXemplar&gt; moparisthebest: acl cleared and tom is founder
[23:04:27] &lt;eXemplar&gt; tom is the only one on there, so speak to him re: setting up access
[23:06:01] &lt;eXemplar&gt; (it was easier just to drop the channel and re-reg, rather than clearing the acl manually rof)
[23:06:56] &lt;_^_&gt; what the love did you do
[23:07:05] &lt;_^_&gt; lazy incompetent oper
[23:14:07] --&gt; Fuscate (Fuscate@users-4kd.p57.166.101.IP) has joined #moparscape
[23:14:33] &lt;eXemplar&gt; I did what was requested
[23:14:35] -*- eXemplar slaps _^_ around a bit with a large trout
[23:20:40] &lt;_^_&gt; eXemplar: what was requested

As you can see, Tom was right change is going to happen. Everyone be ready, because this forum is about to be twisted around!

Lets discuss about change we think may happen, please nothing stupid or anything about cats.

I see for us more awards given out, more community member nominations, a new mod or two, hell I see a new theme in the future!</description>
