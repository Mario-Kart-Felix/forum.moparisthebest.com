    <title>508 Server - Doing Stuff With Objects</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-server-doing-stuff-with-objects/249028</link>
    <description>Hey. I went into the Downloads section and downloaded a semi-blank 508 server/client and am working on it. Now, I&#39;m adding opening/closing doors. The only problem is, I don&#39;t know what stuff to write. If I try, I get dced (I&#39;ve tried changing the y instead of rotating it.) Is there any chance someone can tell me what they write? Like, [i]writeByte(val)[/i]?

I&#39;d prefer the data to write to actually rotate it.

Thanks,
