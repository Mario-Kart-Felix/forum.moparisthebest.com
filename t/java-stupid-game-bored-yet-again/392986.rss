    <title>[Java] Stupid Game (Bored yet again)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-stupid-game-bored-yet-again/392986</link>
    <description>Yeah, I was bored so I wrote this game. There is a random number that acts as a die. The player rolls it and they can either attack or use magic. Attacking will subtract the number from the die from the other player&#39;s health. Using magic will give you different spells. That have their own damage capabilities based of another random number specific to the spell. Again it&#39;s all text - based, as all my other projects are, and I know this is stupid, but I was bored.

[code]import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        int dieOne = (int) (Math.random() * 5) + 1;
        int air;
        int water;
        int earth;
        int fire;
        int necromancy;
        int lightning;
        int playerOneHealth = 50;
        int playerTwoHealth = 50;
        int damage = dieOne;
        String choice;
        String spell = null;
        boolean firstTime = true;

        while (playerOneHealth &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; playerTwoHealth &gt; 0) {

            dieOne = (int) (Math.random() * 5) + 1;
            damage = dieOne;

            //Stuff for player 1
            if (firstTime == true) {

                firstTime = false;

            } else {

                System.out.println(&quot;&quot;);

            }

            System.out.println(&quot;Player one rolled a: &quot; + dieOne + &quot; for their die,&quot;);
            System.out.print(&quot;Please choose either Attack or Magic: &quot;);

            choice = input.nextLine();

            if (choice.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Attack&quot;)) {

<p>What do you mean? The number you roll will make you use different magic types which hit different amounts. So you could hit higher or lower that what you would of hit with attack.</p>

              <p>Yeah, I was bored so I wrote this game. There is a random number that acts as a die. The player rolls it and they can either attack or use magic. Attacking will subtract the number from the die from the other player’s health. Using magic will give you different spells. That have their own damage capabilities based of another random number specific to the spell. Again it’s all text - based, as all my other projects are, and I know this is stupid, but I was bored.</p>
