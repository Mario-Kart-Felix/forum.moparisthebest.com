    <title>Need a logo for my Pures home website please</title>

    <description>Well I already supplied you with enough for the image, all I need is some awesome text (thats not crappy btw).

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here is the picture I want you to edit:
http://fc78.deviantart.com/fs28/f/2008/063/1/b/Rise_of_the_Prince_by_ahbeejieh.jpg

And here is where I want my text to be:
http://i44.tinypic.com/2v2wmtz.png&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now it would be more awesome if you could like put some glowing lines around him (making it seem like hes absorbing some sort of protecting power).




I&#39;d do all this myself but gimp suck so I can do everything like I want it to be.</description>

              <p>Gimp… You think its easy because all you have to do is use simple buttons to make a text glow in photoshop. But Gimp, its actually harder then anyone here thinks… Only way I know of is to wright some text, paste it again and blur it, but its not working the right way I want it. Beside, photoshop has more focus (aka smoothness) on colors then gimp.</p>
<p>In gimp you have to go into deep, raw details to get what you want. Photoshop, its easier to use. If I knew how to get my photoshop to work then I wouldn’t have such as BS time doing this myself. But apparently no one hasn’t answered my previous problem so you can’t say much if you talk about me using photoshop (until I get my problem fixed maybe/though).</p>

              <p>Firstly, Gimp doesn’t suck, it is very capable of doing the easy crap you just said. Second, that sounds awful, that’s what beginners do. I wouldn’t even waste my time opening photoshop to do something so simple. And no one else should either. If you’re not capable of placing some text on an image, and brushing a little, then you don’t deserve it.</p>
