              <p>[quote=“ytuio9, post:4, topic:329800”]well obviously… and to change where you START OUT, you go to player.java and do the same. but anyways since we’re here for the death, you’re going to die, and type in ::mypos. then get the co-ords.</p>
<p>e.g:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">ytuio3: ::mypos
mypos: absX = 1234, absY = 5678</code></pre>
<p>so in client.java you’ll search for 1234. make sure it’s something like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">toX = 1234;
toY = 5678;</code></pre>
<p>then edit it as much as you want <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> remember some sources have the deathstage thingy repeated a few times, so i guess you’ll have to re-edit them (mine, i had to add this 3 times lol)[/quote]<br>
I have no idea what just happened but whenever I die. It says “Oh dear! Your dead” and then my hp restarts to 99.</p>
