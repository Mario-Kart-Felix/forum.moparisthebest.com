    <description>[b]Don&#39;t eat.[/b]

I tried it. Firstly I must say I do not have an addictive personality or focus much on my body or looks. I did it in an attempt to try and personally understand friends of mine. I started at 176lbs and initial weight loss was quick probably due to emptying my body of the waste (poo) over the first couple of days. I drank only water and tea, white with one, as I normally would. I did my normal work involving moderate exercise and lost 11lbs, not even a stone! Worrying and unexpected symptoms nearing the 7 days were: problems with vision flickering &amp; focusing; giddiness and fatigue started very early when exertion was needed. NOTE: Half the weight was back on with in a couple of days. Loosing weight fast is not a viable method for people who need to loose weight, and is Definitely Very Dangerous to people who have little weight to loose. Ravonseed.

Actually, your metabolism will go into &quot;starvation mode&quot; and slow down. This is why recovering anorexics gain more weight back than they originally had before the eating disorder. Trust me; I&#39;ve been there.

If you&#39;re really going to do the drastic scary weight loss strategy, eat a small amount every day, divided into four or five small snacks.

An intake of a small portion of food every few hours throughout the day will speed up your metabolism, AND you&#39;re guaranteed to still lose weight in a very small amount of time because of the substantial decrease in calories.

              <p>[quote=“io9, post:3, topic:248835”]That’s extremely moronic. When you start eating you’re going to gain more pounds instantly than you lost. Not only that, you’ll lose your original ones very slowly (your body will store all the energy it can as fat, thinking you’re in a famine). And when you start eating normally, it’ll be storing almost everything it lost, gaining the shit back right away, and then some. On the other hand, if you eat a lot of low-density foods (salad with light ranch, lean meats, baked potato crisps instead of fried ones, all in proper portions), your body will be like, “HOLY SHIT SO MUCH FUCKING FOOD BURN EVERYTHING!121213,” and you’ll end up losing pounds by the week. That’s how I lost almost 50 pounds in one month (obviously combined with exercise). You can PM me for details.</p>
<p>My ideal diet was &lt;1200 kcal, and &lt;10g fat per day, and 400kcal per meal at most. Seeing as this was in the summer, I had almost 5 hours of physical activity a day. Also, keep a pedometer on you at all times, and try to walk at least 5 miles per day (~= 10,000 steps). It’s piss-easy, I managed to get more than 56,000 in one day (approximately 23 miles!!). Doing mountain trails can help you get some steps in. Those were my weekends. Go to one end of the trail, camp the night, come back first thing in the morning (of course bring food with you to cook there, as you have to be VERY consistent with your meals). Also, avoid skipping meals at all costs, meals were ideally 4 hours separated with a snack (myb 100 kcal tops each) in between them every 2.5 hours.</p>

<p>i wrestle and im in the offseason<br>
with what you just said about the flickering of the vision brought back some torturous memories<br>
because you feel gloomy, tired, sedative all the time when cutting weight<br>
you also look nastily thin.</p>

The best way is to just eat celery as you use more calories eathing it than you get from it. Meaning you lose weight. Just not eating is a ridiculous way to lose it.

              <p>[quote=“io9, post:3, topic:248835”]That’s extremely moronic. When you start eating you’re going to gain more pounds instantly than you lost. Not only that, you’ll lose your original ones very slowly (your body will store all the energy it can as fat, thinking you’re in a famine). And when you start eating normally, it’ll be storing almost everything it lost, gaining the shit back right away, and then some. On the other hand, if you eat a lot of low-density foods (salad with light ranch, lean meats, baked potato crisps instead of fried ones, all in proper portions), your body will be like, “HOLY SHIT SO MUCH FUCKING FOOD BURN EVERYTHING!121213,” and you’ll end up losing pounds by the week. That’s how I lost almost 50 pounds in one month (obviously combined with exercise). You can PM me for details.</p>
<p>My ideal diet was &lt;1200 kcal, and &lt;10g fat, and 400kcal per meal at most) Seeing as this was in the summer, I had almost 5 hours of physical activity a day. Also, keep a pedometer on you at all times, and try to walk at least 5 miles per day (~= 10,000 steps). It’s piss-easy, I managed to get more than 56,000 in one day (approximately 23 miles!!). Doing mountain trails can help you get some steps in. Those were my weekends. Go to one end of the trail, camp the night, come back first thing in the morning (of course bring food with you to cook there, as you have to be VERY consistent with your meals). Also, avoid skipping meals at all costs, meals were ideally 4 hours separated with a snack (myb 100 kcal tops each) in between them every 2.5 hours.</p>
<p>Holy fuck this post deserves a thread in its own.[/quote]Write a book and you could go on Opera.</p>

              <p><span class="bbcode-b">Don’t eat.</span></p>
<p>I tried it. Firstly I must say I do not have an addictive personality or focus much on my body or looks. I did it in an attempt to try and personally understand friends of mine. I started at 176lbs and initial weight loss was quick probably due to emptying my body of the waste (poo) over the first couple of days. I drank only water and tea, white with one, as I normally would. I did my normal work involving moderate exercise and lost 11lbs, not even a stone! Worrying and unexpected symptoms nearing the 7 days were: problems with vision flickering &amp; focusing; giddiness and fatigue started very early when exertion was needed. NOTE: Half the weight was back on with in a couple of days. Loosing weight fast is not a viable method for people who need to loose weight, and is Definitely Very Dangerous to people who have little weight to loose. Ravonseed.</p>
<p>Actually, your metabolism will go into “starvation mode” and slow down. This is why recovering anorexics gain more weight back than they originally had before the eating disorder. Trust me; I’ve been there.</p>
<p>If you’re really going to do the drastic scary weight loss strategy, eat a small amount every day, divided into four or five small snacks.</p>
<p>An intake of a small portion of food every few hours throughout the day will speed up your metabolism, AND you’re guaranteed to still lose weight in a very small amount of time because of the substantial decrease in calories.<br>
