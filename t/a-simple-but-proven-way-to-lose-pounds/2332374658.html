        <p>Too be honest, I don’t see why so many fat shits complain that they can’t get fit, if you want to get fit you’ve got to <span class="bbcode-b">make</span> it happen. Like a friend of mine who has bigger boobs than Silab, and he’s MALE!!! said he wanted to get fit and come and train with me, so I offered for him to come to the gym with me and do a workout which I normally do for kickboxing, normally consists of some weights, but more running.</p>
<p>I run for about 10kms, fluctuating between a faster run and a jog, a lot of people ask me how I stay motivated and my motivation is my racing - since I’m not racing in my class anymore, and will be the only 14 year old in 125A, I want to make a name for myself and come into it as hard as I can, so I’m going to need to be at the top of my game physically.</p>
<p>People sometimes train better by themselves, but I use the motivation of competition to train and work my arse off.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Yz85Racer, post:27, topic:233237”]Too be honest, I don’t see why so many fat shits complain that they can’t get fit, if you want to get fit you’ve got to <span class="bbcode-b">make</span> it happen. Like a friend of mine who has bigger boobs than Silab, and he’s MALE!!! said he wanted to get fit and come and train with me, so I offered for him to come to the gym with me and do a workout which I normally do for kickboxing, normally consists of some weights, but more running.</p>
<p>I run for about 10kms, fluctuating between a faster run and a jog, a lot of people ask me how I stay motivated and my motivation is my racing - since I’m not racing in my class anymore, and will be the only 14 year old in 125A, I want to make a name for myself and come into it as hard as I can, so I’m going to need to be at the top of my game physically.</p>
<p>People sometimes train better by themselves, but I use the motivation of competition to train and work my arse off.[/quote]</p>
<p>Shame you have bigger tits than your mother and you have celulite streaming out of every possible exit.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure about the spicy food.</p>
<p>However drinking a lot of water is really good because it keeps your body hydrated, it flushes your system of excess stuff (thus the potential for weightloss), and it can also fill you up a bit. If you’re working out and actually trying to lose weight then you should be drinking 16+ glasses (at least double the usual recommendation) per day.</p>
<p>Another important thing when trying to lose weight is the way you eat. Many people rush eating, and in doing so they eat excessively. By eating a bit slower you give your body the chance to tell you that you’re full.</p>
<p>Small meals are good for this reason, but it’s often a hard transition to make if you rely on your parents for meals. 6 small meals a day ensure that you have energy but don’t overindulge. You should be having something small every 2 hours or so.<br>
Generally speaking, a piece of fruit every 2 hours will get you by. You can also eat things like nuts, oatmeal (or something else that’s grainy in nature). Avoid overly processed cereals, because they’re crap.</p>
<p>I’m sure there are more approaches, but I can’t be bothered listing them. It’s all about the types of foods you eat though.<br>
For example, you should have things like bananas and apples in the earlier portion of the day because their carbohydrate chains are ‘simpler’ in nature when compared to the carbohydrates in foods like lettuce and broccoli.</p>
<p>EDIT: Oh, and bread is probably best avoided if you want to lose weight quickly. Yeah, it’s a staple meal in the lives of most people, but it’s also not the best (unless full grain, preferably as grainy as possible). White bread is absolutely a no-go zone if you’re serious about getting fit, because it’s just rubbish.</p>

<p>Very true.</p>
<p>Most kids in America eat lunch at school and out of all the schools I have attended, the maximum lunch break was 30 minutes. That is about fifteen minutes getting your lunch and then fifteen minutes to eat it, so most kids eat their lunches pretty quickly. Fifteen minutes is not enough time for your body to tell your brain that you are full, so most people tend to over eat.</p>
<p>Also, try to avoid watching T.V. while you are eating, a lot of times you aren’t aware that you are eating because your so into what your watching.</p>
<p>I’m Indian so I live off spicy food and it tastes great, but don’t expect to loose weight from it.</p>

<p>The TV thing is so true, it also happens if you play games. Me and my friend played Halo 3 when we were eating, ended up eating a whole bunch and got a stomach ache  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
