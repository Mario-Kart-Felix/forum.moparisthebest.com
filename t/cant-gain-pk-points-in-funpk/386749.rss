    <title>Can&#39;t gain PK Points in FunPK?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-gain-pk-points-in-funpk/386749</link>
    <description>I need to make it where you can&#39;t gain PK points for killing players in FunPK. (This server is Project Insanity)

Right now my code is this:

[code=java]
				if (Server.playerHandler.players[c.playerId].connectedFrom != o.lastKilled) {
					o.sendMessage(&quot;You have defeated &quot;+Misc.optimizeText(c.playerName)+&quot; and recieved 1 PK point.&quot;);
					o.pkPoints = (o.pkPoints + 1);
					o.lastKilled = Server.playerHandler.players[c.playerId].connectedFrom;
				} else {
					o.sendMessage(&quot;You do not recieve pk points because you have killed &quot; +c.playerName+ &quot; twice in a row.&quot;);
				}
			}[/code]

Would I change line #1 so it maybe looks like this?

if (Server.playerHandler.players[c.playerId].connectedFrom != o.lastKilled &amp;&amp; !c.inFunPK()) {


Any help is greatly appreciated.
