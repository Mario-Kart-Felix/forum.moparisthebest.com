    <title>Artificial Trees to soak up CO2</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/artificial-trees-to-soak-up-co2/318787</link>
    <description>Watched this on a program.. these trees are pretty cool and they reckon a fully grown one will soak up 75 car&#39;s worth of CO2 A DAY!

And they can be planted anywhere in the world and they think if they plant 60 million of these it will get rid of the worlds pollution altogether.

All these trees need is a water supply

&lt;blockquote&gt;Engineers say a forest of 100,000 &quot;artificial trees&quot; could be deployed within 10 to 20 years to help soak up the world&#39;s carbon emissions.

The trees are among three geo-engineering ideas highlighted as practical in a new report.

The authors from the Institution of Mechanical Engineers say that without geo-engineering it will be impossible to avoid dangerous climate change.

The report includes a 100-year roadmap to &quot;decarbonise&quot; the global economy.

No silver bullet

Launching the report, lead author Dr Tim Fox said geo-engineering should not be viewed as a &quot;silver bullet&quot; that could combat climate change in isolation.

He told BBC News it should be used in conjunction with efforts to reduce carbon emissions and to adapt to the effects of climate change.

Many climate scientists calculate that the world has only a few decades to reduce emissions before there is so much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that a dangerous rise in global temperature is inevitable.

	
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME


More from Today programme

The authors of this report say that geo-engineering of the type they propose should be used on a short-term basis to buy the world time, but in the long term it is vital to reduce emissions.

They define two types of geo-engineering. Nem Vaughan of University of East Anglia said: &quot;The first category attempts to cool the planet by reflecting some of the sunlight away. The problem with this is that it just masks the problem.&quot;

&quot;The other type of geo-engineering is to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it.&quot;

Hundreds of options

The team studied hundreds of different options but have put forward just three as being practical and feasible using current technology.

A key factor in choosing the three was that they should be low-carbon technologies rather than adding to the problem.

Dr Fox told BBC News: &quot;Artificial trees are already at the prototype stage and are very advanced in their design in terms of their automation and in the components that would be used.

&quot;They could, within a relatively short duration, be moved forward into mass production and deployment.&quot;

The trees would work on the principle of capturing carbon dioxide from the air through a filter.

The CO2 would then be removed from the filter and stored. The report calls for the technology to be developed in conjunction with carbon storage infrastructure.

The captured carbon dioxide could be stored in empty north sea oil wells

Dr Fox said the prototype artificial tree was about the same size as a shipping container and could remove thousands of times more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than an equivalent sized real tree.

Another of the team&#39;s preferred methods of capturing carbon is to install what they term &quot;algae based photobioreactors&quot; on buildings. These would be transparent containers containing algae which would remove carbon dioxide from the air during photosynthesis.
buildings with algae units
Algae units could be designed into new buildings or retrofitted to old ones

The third option focuses on the reduction of incoming solar radiation by reflecting sunlight back into space. The report says the simplest way of doing this is for buildings to have reflective roofs.

The authors stress that all of these options will require more research and have called for the UK government to invest 10 million pounds in analysis of the effectiveness, risks and costs of geo-engineering.

Dr Fox said: &quot;We very much believe that the practical geo-engineering that we are proposing should be implemented and could be very much part of our landscape within the next 10 to 20 years.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>Yes, you get a chlorine free radical which attacks an ozone molecule to produce a ClO free radical and oxygen (or dioxygen as you like to call it). Then the ClO free radical can be considered to attack a single oxygen atom to produce another oxygen molecule (O2) and another chlorine free radical which continues the chain reaction.[/quote]It was a typo, I know di refers to two in dioxygen (O<span class="bbcode-b">2</span>).</p>

              <p>Hmm I don’t think CO2 emissions are what is causing the climatic shift in temperature. Chlorofluorocarbons are used in various aerosols and have found their way through air currents to the ice poles of the Earth, where they react with ozone (O3) to produce dioxygen (O2). During the winter periods when each pole is receiving such less ultraviolet light because the Earth is spherical and when the light hits the poles of the Earth it is distributed more evenly, the dioxygen is not being converted back to ozone (which evidently blocks ultraviolet frequencies). So the poles are heating and melting. Dioxygen is converted back to ozone by ultraviolet electromagnetic waves splitting them into diatomic oxygen atoms, which react with more dioxygen to produce ozone. O2 + O = 03.</p>

<p>Like cleaning out our jam pots so they can be ‘recycled’? Let’s not forget about the massive supermarket chains who continue to sell products with far too much packaging, and fly in standard fruit &amp; veg just because the labour costs work out a bit cheaper. And the mass production factories in China polluting like there’s no tomorrow. Setting stricter laws around this sort of stuff would be a much better idea than wasting time telling people to not leave their tv’s on standby and to turn the tap off between brushing your teeth.</p>

climate change is natural yes, but the earth isn’t getting colder. If it was, why is the ice METLING ?[/quote]<br>
the only ice you have to worry abotu melting is the ice thats on land even the stuff thats above sea level but in the water wont cause sea levels to rise</p>
