    <title>[Law question] DVD order fraud?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/law-question-dvd-order-fraud/458548</link>
    <description>So there is this online DVD store company from my country which delivers CDs/DVDs by first ordering them from sources such as Amazon and other stores and then shipping to my country address.

Now first of all when I ordered the product, on the page the price was saying 35 leva (~$22). Yesterday when I checked my mail after making my order a week ago I got a message from them saying that the DVD will be delivered to my home. They have quoted the e-mail I sent with the order which still contained the product link, I accidentally clicked it and when I saw it, it was saying 50 leva. That&#39;s way too much. Now I&#39;m quite afraid that they might say that I ordered the DVD in the price 50 leva, but I actually ordered it while it was saying 35 leva in the product description. I e-mailed them back and even sent them a message on Skype asking about if the old price still counts but I still haven&#39;t gotten a reply back.

Now incase the DVD arrives and I get costed 50 leva for it, and I refuse to pay, and if I happen to get &quot;sued&quot; do I have any chance of proving that they did a fraud?

I have ordered from them in the past btw and once I ordered the first DVD, I noticed a price change on the same product link, it must be because they are using a different source once the first one is being shipped, and they are replacing it with another one which seems to cost more, so I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s the same case here. What are your thoughts?</description>

I don’t think that matters. They are most certainly breaking EU law already, so if they don’t want it returned, you have a case against them.</p>

              <p>I’m not generally sure about law over their but from general awareness you can say this.<br>
Companies have a reputation, if you claim they make a mistake (better yet you provide proof that they did) they will usually say that’s fine and offer you the product at the original price and give you it. If that’s not the case do not pay them and give them the item back and let them know you will not be ordering from them again.<br>
Usually any big company cares about you coming back as a lot of companies profits are from returning customers. Hope I helped although I don’t feel like I have haha</p>

              <p>So there is this online DVD store company from my country which delivers CDs/DVDs by first ordering them from sources such as Amazon and other stores and then shipping to my country address.</p>
<p>Now first of all when I ordered the product, on the page the price was saying 35 leva (~$22). Yesterday when I checked my mail after making my order a week ago I got a message from them saying that the DVD will be delivered to my home. They have quoted the e-mail I sent with the order which still contained the product link, I accidentally clicked it and when I saw it, it was saying 50 leva. That’s way too much. Now I’m quite afraid that they might say that I ordered the DVD in the price 50 leva, but I actually ordered it while it was saying 35 leva in the product description. I e-mailed them back and even sent them a message on Skype asking about if the old price still counts but I still haven’t gotten a reply back.</p>
<p>Now incase the DVD arrives and I get costed 50 leva for it, and I refuse to pay, and if I happen to get “sued” do I have any chance of proving that they did a fraud?</p>
<p>I have ordered from them in the past btw and once I ordered the first DVD, I noticed a price change on the same product link, it must be because they are using a different source once the first one is being shipped, and they are replacing it with another one which seems to cost more, so I’m hoping it’s the same case here. What are your thoughts?</p>
