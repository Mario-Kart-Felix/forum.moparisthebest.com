    <title>This is getting stupid</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/this-is-getting-stupid/244635</link>
    <description>Certain mods here are either abusing there powers or not doing there intended job correctly. Making these forums an unpleasant place to be. 

http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,320025.0.html
- no explanation as to the locking of this thread. As far as i am concerned it should still be open

http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,319899.0.html
- no explanation either? From the looks of it a mod read it, got bored of it. Locked it and went on his merry way to wreak havoc on someone else.

http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,320208.0.html
- this either proves unworthy mod positions, or at least poses no reason as to the locking

http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,319481.0.html
- yet another topic closed without even a words reason from the locker

http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,319480.0.html
- the mods posting in this thread obviously got bored and decided no one else deserved to put in there 2 cents worth

http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,319346.0.html
- ...sigh yet another locked thread for an unknown reason

http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,318134.20.html
- The moderator put in his opinion, and then promptly locked the thread. Great way to end a debate...

[b]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,320968.0.html
- care to explain why? [/b] im not saying it was a great thread... but there was no reason to lock that other than out of boredom/spite

http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,319659.20.html
- too many bragging comments will be made? Yes...lets make wild assumptions for the pure reason of &#39;i cant be ass&#39;d to read anymore answers&#39; 

http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,309127.0.html
- are you the kids mummy? NO. A valid thread with valid responses has no reason to be un-validly locked.

http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,320375.0.html
- a mods job is not to control a thread. DO NOT DELETE MY POSTS (and to a lesser extent other peoples).


Now, you may be asking why did i go to the trouble to post this thread? 
I am a veteran scripter. Likely to be older to the cheating forums than any of you. Most of the mods are doing a good job. But a select few of you are just shitting this place up, and i demand a certain level of professionalism from the [i]&#39;leaders&#39;[/i] of the community.



I [b]demand [/b]that you offending mods start moderating correctly.
And i [i][u][b]demand [/b][/u][/i]a personal apology from [u]Greeny[/u], to the community. You are the majority of the moderating problem. You know it, i know, the community knows it.  Your shitting this place up.



edit.
Just putting my main point into this first post, as im assuming Greeny will no doubt lock, and probably delete my post. 

My point: Shape up Greeny, or your days as a mod are numbered.</description>

<p>You mods are all sticking together, so theres not going to be any surprise when one of you lock this thread.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I left this thread open hoping for an intelligent discussion about the “problems” with the staff(and to work out a solution), what I got was a returning member that doesn’t like how some staff do their job and has to bitch and whine about it until he gets his own way.</p>
<p>If you want to be the peoples saviour from the evil staff, be my guest. You aren’t be the first, and probably won’t be the last. The problem here is, there are people who generally don’t care about the state of the forum and just stay because it’s what their used to and like it, and people who stay who have to whine and moan about poor staff using any excuse to do so, simply  because they don’t get their own way. I’m afraid you’re in the latter category, you chose to post this thread because your thread got locked, a few of your posts were deleted(for good reason, imo) and threw in a few other threads that have been locked - erm, I have to say unfairly, but with good reason. If you don’t like the forum, put up with it or leave. If you can’t do either options, at least offer valid solutions before stating the staff aren’t “doing their job”[1] and demand changes.</p>
<p>[1] As Greeny stated, we are doing voluntary work, we are not getting paid and do not have to do anything. The only person who gets money from these forums is the person that pays for them, moparisthebest. The rest of us staff are here because we were asked to join the staff team and agreed to do so.</p>

<p>That would be me.  I attempted to keep this thread from the shits, but it seems my attempt was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>I feel the need to lock this now; we’ve all gotten some things out and that might possibly be what was needed.  Squigglyo, if you wish to continue this appeal, I suggest you do so to an administrator, as posting a thread leads to nothing more then what you see here.</p>
