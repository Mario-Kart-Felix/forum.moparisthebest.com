    <title>[PI] Adding a ::maxhit command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-adding-a-maxhit-command/459125</link>
    <description>Hey everyone!
I just wanted some help on adding a ::maxhit command.
What the command does, the gear you&#39;re wearing it will tell you what the max hit is in that.
Then if you change gear, what the max hit is in that etc. :)
Thanks very much in advance.</description>
