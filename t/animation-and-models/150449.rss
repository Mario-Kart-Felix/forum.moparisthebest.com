    <description>Hi,  
 I&#39;ve adapted the RS model viewer to export metasequoia files(for editing) and i want to try to adapt the viewer to display character animation, which is what i&#39;m stuck on.

Can anyone help with the following :-

Does anyone know which class, in the 317 deob, deals with animation? 
Does anyone know where the animation files are stored? server or client cache?
Does anyone have an animation file? (for anything!)

I&#39;d write an RS model exporter, but there&#39;s no point in creating custom character models if you can&#39;t animate them!

              <p>Sh!ft you’re right. The password changer appears to be servlet based indeed, but in order to access it you have to through “login to access this feature” page that contains a login applet which is obfuscated. I mistook login applet for the password changer applet itself, my bad. Still would be nice if someone could post the old password changer applet.<br>
And Silver Lining i reported you.</p>

<p>Wrong again, there’s two model formats and they are both used, it’s why half your object models don’t load properly in bentski’s model viewer, but I guess you wouldn’t notice it, you couldn’t code it.</p>
<p>Bentski only supports the main format.</p>

<p>The actual model files (28704-28720) that end in FFFF are talking heads like the 0.dat, the footer has an extra byte flag at the beginning, one in the middle and 4 (bytes) at the end (including the FFFF).<br>
You can hexedit the extra values out to view them in rsmv if you don’t have delphi.<br>
Apart from those flags and maybe some animation data we don’t yet understand, it’s still the same file format!!!</p>

If you read the ‘large’ file reader method you’ll notice that animation data (3 sets of data) is read using NumTri as a counter, even though the data maybe NumVert or less in length. On very small models there is the possibilty of reading past the end of the file, so i guess the second ‘small’ format is used to prevent crashes…i’ll check.</p>

<p>Not really. “NumTri” is “g3”. Etc, etc. I don’t see how it would read beyond it? Maybe I’m just blind from all the lemon squeezing &lt;3. Wait, that’s onions, shit. I use jagex’s in house names for packet and packetcypher.</p>

P.S. If anyone can upload and PM me a link to a newer format model, it’d be interesting to look at, and i’d be very grateful…<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t believe the model format has changed between old and new engine clients.  Therefore sh!ft must mean that jagex uses both formats in both clients.[/quote]<br>
To the contrary, there is two DISTINCT formats. However, it is true that the second format is widely unused, for now.</p>
<p>This community seems to adore regression. No community projects? No community documentation? No one stops frank_ and other counter productive members from spamming up the place with pointless comments and general insults, instead they’re promoted to “Community Member.” It’s more like bottom feeding, cleaning up what scraps the knowledgeable wipe off their table.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">    private model(byte[] file) {
        if (file[file.length - 1] == -1 &amp;&amp; file[file.length - 2] == -1)
            unpack_small(file);
        else
            unpack_large(file);
    }</code></pre>
<p>That’s the sieve. Two clear formats. Oh, and by the way, you can use that to hook the model class.</p>
<p>Edit: Somehow, I feel warranted in adding this -&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve</a></p>
