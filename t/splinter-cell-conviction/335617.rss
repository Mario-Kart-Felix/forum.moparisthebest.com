              <p>Got it, game has good controls, decent slick graphics, very interactive coop and an excellent story. The only bit to argue with is the AI, and its a small argument at that. You have to be very careful about everything, if anyone sees a body they’ll call up their team and investigate, so you have to grab people and pull them into the shadows (screen goes black and white) and kill them there. Any lights that get shot out they start patrolling. So if you get a successful kill and no one notices, you know you did a good job.</p>
<p>Ill give it a 9 out of 10.</p>

              <p>I was disseminated in the AI personally. You can crouch and walk past someone and not be noticed. The AI should be more questioning about whats happening behind them. A simple “Did you hear that?” to let the player know that they’re noticing something. The AI does not react to gunshots to someones head who is not in sight, but if they are seen killed or if you missed they will freak out and patrol the area. They react to lights being shot out, while the darkness also less you hide from their site.</p>
<p>Im sure after the demo many people have thought the same about the Ai. But thats what a community is about. Im pretty sure ubisoft was open to suggestions after the demo was released.</p>

Metal Gear Solid on the original Playstation had better Ai, the developers touting this as a redefinition of not only the franchise but the entire genre made me hope that they would actually put some thought into the Ai, it is completely unacceptable for a game in 2010.<br>

This is Ubisoft you’re talking about, a company that decided to start producing PC games that require an always-on internet connection to play. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> They’re a joke, and so are most of their games.[/quote]<br>
Such a shitty game company, its a shame they were the makers of Assassins Creed 2. Such an amazing game put under the label of a crappy game studio.</p>
<p>Apparently the game as been delayed several times to fix AI: <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/62571">http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/62571</a> <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=236873">http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=236873</a></p>

Uhhhh, the AI in Splinter Cell games has been extremely poor from the word go. The gameplay is virtually static, and you can finish the game through trial and error alone when it comes to encounters with NPCs.</p>

<p>The thing with Splinter Cell is its a great game and always a solid campaign, but I find all the Splinter Cell games have a short “life time” for a gamer.</p>

<p>This is what i thought on the demo, i later found that there were tons of ways you could do the demo and sneak around in different paths. So im guessing if you actual look closely theres tons of ways you can do stuff. But the game also has a co-op campaign that is separate from the original and multiplayer.</p>
