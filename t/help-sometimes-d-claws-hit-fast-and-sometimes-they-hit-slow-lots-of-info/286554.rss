    <description>Hey guys, i just added d claws, and im pretty aggravated.
I added the attack animation, which i &quot;borrowed&quot; from torag&#39;s hammers.
Then, sometimes the claws would hit up to 3 hits per second, and later it would be 1 per turn.
this is strange :(
I am currently using Richscape 4.0 as a source.
Thanks for reading

Postin my item.config, for d claws:
[code]item = 8002	Dragon_claws	A_set_of_fighting_clawz	2304900	2300000	2300000	40	45	-4	0	0	13	26	7	0	0	0	0	60[/code]
Also this from Player.java:
[code]
	if (playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 8002) {
		return 2068;
	}[/code]
