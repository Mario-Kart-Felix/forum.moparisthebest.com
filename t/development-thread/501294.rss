    <description>Hey There Guys.
Im Lirim, searching for a Development Thread.
The Server is already getting Hosted.
I will need a Website Developer who is good with Graphics, PHP, HTML . Maybe if you could, CSS too.
I need also a client + a Source Developer. The Server-Name i took is &quot;Penthium&quot;.
Add me on Skype &quot;Lirimoo&quot; if you would like some more informations. I will decide who joins and who not.
I got 3 VPS&#39;s that are avaible for now, 1 is Taken. I will be hosting 3 Servers. 

At all we will start with the Eco server. Check the Advertisement Section for Penthium. :&#39;) ♥</description>
