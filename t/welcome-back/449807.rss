The whole point of infractions are to hopefully change your attitude so you wont break the rules again, not just as a punishment. If you go around breaking rules while moderated it’s just saying “this isnt enough to make me change my attitude”, and personally I think that still deserves an infraction. Depending on what the rule is you’re breaking, of course. For things like minor spam, you’re right it should just be un-approved, but things like flame, etc, still warrant punishment.</p>

<p>The only crappy part about it is that you can get infracted for posts when you’re moderated and they haven’t even been approved :(.[/quote]Not sure what you’re referring to, but when you’re moderated you should be even more careful about breaking the rules.

It’s only ‘crap’ to you, completely reasonable considering you’re one of the forums morons. I put you in the same category as the fellow with the “I like apples” signature. The only difference is that hes actually 6 and you just act like it.</p>

what?
<p>The statement being made here is that the current staff do a fine job (I don’t know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.). This nonsense pointing out that staff made some rude comments or ‘get away’ with things is just ridiculous. The forum is for fun and enjoyment, if you don’t enjoy it go to a different forums the internet only has over 8999 of them.</p>

<p>I agree with everything you said - the staff here get away with far to much.  For example, the elve age edited a thread yesterday to something inappropriate, and when I brought it to Taharok, all he said is thanks, let me know if you see it again.  The staff never get in trouble around here, they get to do what they want, and it’ll never change.</p>

<p>David your misunderstanding what I at least am complaining about. But in regards to harshness its just pick n choose, you can get infractions for tiny things and for huge things your fine? But then again things that I classify as a big deal may be different than what other people think is a big deal.</p>

You may think that why I have linked that - I have linked that becase Muslims were not involved in the discussion until that was said, idk why my faith (I know I’m hardly a muslim but I’ve been brought up with that culture and so forth) was slandered. idk why nothing was done about it? Irl if someone said this at a work place, educational institiuation and so forth they’d get disiciplined as a person saying “fuck Jesus” which is just unacceptable.<br>
I’m sure the soul said it too, maybe he removed his post as its unacceptable… My apologies if I’m wrong about the soul (which I doubt but hey I might be).</p>

              <p>If you guys really wanted us to be hardasses all the time we could be. We prefer to try and make the forums a fun place to be, and two things that involve are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not being TOO harsh when it comes to giving out punishments</li>
<li>Being able to have fun ourselves</li>
</ol>
<p>As for number one, the forum is full of hypocrites because I have gotten complaints about being too harsh from many people, and then some (not as many, but still a few) about being too lenient. Fact of the matter is, people have different expectations. Some people here are more hard ass than the moderators. For example, some people report posts that contain the word ‘retard’, whereas others say it and don’t even find it offensive. Others report posts that offend one religion but not others (as one example, the MITB community as a whole is very secular against Christianity etc and isn’t afraid to show it over here as well, but no one reports those posts), it gets reported and flamed. Which is another point, especially against you Kidpaproach. You fight flame with flame and then get mad if you get an infraction as well</p>
<p>Anywho, on to number two. This is again just your expectation of the forum. If you expect it to be a completely serious hardass forum (you are wrong on that, by the way), then that’s just your issue and you can’t expect moderators to take on your viewpoint. Fact is the majority of people would rather have a good time at the forum, which involves more lenient moderation. There are a few of you that are more strict than we are, but honestly it’s better if you just leave than try and force your views on everyone else, including the staff members. We are volunteers, and if we aren’t having fun on the forum (at least every once in a while) what is the point of being here?</p>

<p>YOu make out like Rich’s usefulness is better than his actions but I look at it the other way. For a community to respect it’s staff then the staff must show the maturity even if the other poster is not mature.</p>
<p>It’s sort of like when a parent tells their child " do as you are told instead of what I do" that’s just like  saying telling a teenager to “not do” something when you know they are going to do it.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s ignorance, nor is there any excuse for a staff member to have immature language as that no matter the situation.</p>
<p>I do see where your coming from  just saying.</p>

              <p>I wrote a reply for you Tahorak but then decided to delete it as your not going to absorb any information presented to you. In my pms to you reread them, your not reading the words properly. My later pms were worded in that way for a reason, you thought I was apologising for being a ‘douche’ when I was not (I know you didn’t say it but your thinking it, as I would if I were you - not implying I think I’m a douche I’m trying to think the way you think etc if its not obvious).<br>
Nice defensive post though, tis always nice how your trying to shrug it off. Man I need to stop writing stuff, this was not meant to be a reply but I hate leaving things unfinished…<br>
Btw, rich wasn’t included and your making assumptions in my previous post (i.e. rich wasn’t included… why would I include somebody I don’t know?).<br>
Tis a forum, I can discuss st00fz with other forum members if I want, it doesn’t need to be a reply to the OP however it is related so its not ‘spam’.</p>
