    <description>Just one good coder that meet requirements, is friendly, is very active and a good person
and we can make something big.

Requirements :
- Able to make webclient from 0 to 100 without mistake and everything added( Just incase mines fail )
- Able to add items/gfx/emotes/sprites
- Able to add commands
- Able to edit webclients
Example I ask to help me adding skillcapes and he knows how to and can help big time
Example I ask him to help me add PvP sets I only have models and basic ints and he can perfectly add them

Just a good coder I&#39;m asking for we can make the nicest server and make a revolution :p

Source : Project Insanity MTP
Client : MTP Client
[b]Current Planned Goals :[/b]
- Full Combat System
- Skillcape emotes
- Quickchat
- PvP Armours ( Vesta,Statius,Zuriel,Morrigan - I got weapons )
- PvP Artifacts

I also code the basic things I can add things from tutorials and also can fix bugs/glitches
Its just I have more experience with websites/advertising/marketing.
A server needs :
- Good Coder ( Thats what I search )
- Good functional website/forum ( I can make that perfect )
- Good vps/dedi ( I have lifetime :D )
- Good staff ( Me and my partner I will get will be the best )
- Earnings ( I will atleast earn 200$ from advertisements then other earnings will also come in )
When my server players grow my earnings grow also

To introduce myself I&#39;m Cruel, I went to ICT for 2 years to learn about computer technology.

I managed to learn :
- HTML
- CSS
- PHP
- MYSQL
- CURL

I also got introduced in the hacking world so I was there for a bit and learned to DDoS, Make/Spread RAT&#39;s, VPN&#39;ing, Botnet and those things.

And also as job I&#39;m focused to design and code websites as I&#39;m experienced and do this for years.
You maybe know soulsplit.com I was there co owner and also website designer/coder.
But the owner &quot;Pim&quot; is the biggest idiot on the world so I decided to stop working with him and removed my efforts on that server.

What are my plans ?

I want to make a brand new server which doesn&#39;t look like others.
I already have all advertisements ready and since I can script CURL I can activate my moparscape serverstatus with a CURL execution and thats why I&#39;m 24/7 on serverstatus and on top.

Now I need a very experiencer coder that can code very-well and do things I request.
This needs experience with :
- Webclients
- Clients
- Putting models into client
- Adding e.g skillcape emotes/HD Map/etc.

When I got the basics done I wanna start launching it as v1
I expect atleast 100 players and I&#39;m sure I will archieve it.
I have a good dedicated server in my room so I will be using that to first collect money.
I will make money from advertisements on my website and traffic
Not only the popular Google Adsense will play a role but I&#39;m already member of huge traffic sites.

After that I can go huge and do the final steps
I will spare money for sponsored on few serverstatus websites and also
add more traffic to earn more.
I think when I find the perfect partner that can code very-very-well then our team will be successfull.
In walk of time I wanna expand server with tons of things
My plan is huge and I really believe that this can work out.

[b]Fill in application form, I&#39;m only searching one partner that can code java e.g client,server,scripts etc.[/b]

[b]What coding languages do you know :[/b]
[b]Experience you recently got :[/b]
