    <title>playerIsMember [ALLSTAR]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/playerismember-allstar/543259</link>
    <description>Hey everyone. I am using a 317 Allstar base. I am trying to make a member zone/donator zone. 
If I use the command ::membership (username) then that player becomes a member. But whenever they log out, it resets. For some reason my playerIsMemer = 1 doesn&#39;t save, and just resets to 0. Can anyone help me out? Thanks

[code]        if (command.startsWith(&quot;membership&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 2) {
            String member = command.substring(11);

            sendMessage(&quot;Player &quot; + member + &quot; has become a Gold Member!&quot;);

            for (int a = 1; a &lt; PlayerHandler.maxPlayers; a++) {
                if (PlayerHandler.players[a] != null) {
                    if (PlayerHandler.players[a].playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(
                            member)) {
                        PlayerHandler.players[a].playerIsMember = 1;
                    }
                }
            }

        }[/code]</description>

              <p>To answer your question, make sure you’re actually saving the playerIsMember variable when the player logs out, and loading it correctly upon login, otherwise it’s just going to reset to default.</p>
<p>Also I’d advise using a boolean, as there are only two possible outcomes, being a member, or not being a member.</p>
