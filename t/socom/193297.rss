              <p>Render is stretched too much vertically. The blending on the right side is sloppy, and doesn’t blend well at all. You placed the render over the Border layer, causing the render to overlap the border. You continue to use the same font for your name. And it’s barely recognizable. In such a basic signature as this, all you have is the render and your text as the main areas of interest on the signature. Being that the render is such terrible quality. And the text is nasty. You have nothing to fall back on, except the simple background. Which isn’t much.</p>
<p>I don’t see any improvement for this signature, other than the obvious. You’ve exasperated the options in this image. It’s time you find a new style. Smudge sigs are getting old. You aren’t getting any better.</p>
<p>Try adding a stock into it, or something to change the setting of the image. I’d like to imagine him running (Which he is doing.), and maybe have some kind of city, or the ruins of a small office building. on the right side. Something very subtle. It probably won’t work. But that’s all I can think of.</p>
