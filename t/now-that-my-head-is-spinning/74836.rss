    <title>Now that my head is spinning</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/now-that-my-head-is-spinning/74836</link>
    <description>One question or 100 I am still gunna sound so n00b it will probably hurt peoples eyes to read it.
BUT, here is goes anyway.
How to I get into a server ?? I am sure I downloaded whatever the forums told me to download.. Read through quite a few posts and just don&#39;t see what I am doing wrong.
I tried logging into that 127.0.0.1 and it just tells me the server is down. Is it really down ? Or am I doing something wrong ? I don&#39;t know anything about whatever a port does, why I need to change it, how to change it and why I would need to change it just to get into someones server ? Can anyone explain to me in LAMEmans terms what I am doing wrong and how to fix it ? :eek: :confused:
Seriously, I really did have to google most of the questions just to get into the forums.</description>
