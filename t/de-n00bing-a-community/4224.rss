    <description>If a new bot gets released, how about we making it password protected in, say, c++

That way, we say we will only release the auth if you have some rep - grow the community quickly by forcing everyone to make scripts/updates for the bot. As a bonus - everyone is competent!!

What do you think??</description>

<p>You’ve got it!</p>
<p>Let me explain it this way: pplsuqbawlz could probably still provide deobfuscated code because his deobfuscator is supposed to have been unaffected by the new layer of code mangling. He is fine because he does not need to put in any additional work - his program is done.</p>
<p>I, on the other hand, have only saevion’s code to work with at the moment. I wrote a quick patch to fix the main error preventing deobfuscation (<span class="mention">@PSB</span>: the ‘requires a main class’ thing that you bitch about isn’t necessarily true), but it’s not good enough to stand up to use by the ignorant (and probably unwashed…ewww) masses. Requires too much thought…er, manual corrections. I don’t even care enough to make deobs for myself, much less spend the time necessary to make compensations for the new engine’s extra code mangling.</p>
<p>But if I ever do, it will probably be a new program based on a totally different method of opaque predicate detection.</p>

              <p>Anyway, back to the topic at hand.</p>
<p>I don’t see the point of bickering over the authentication method at this point. Also, I don’t think it is relevant which language you program it in. Obviously, you VB 6 whores should stay away, but it really comes down to the packets. You can package/obfuscate/nubfuscate/drugfuscate all you want, but if you sent out a request to a PHP script, and expect a return of “no” or “yes” then you are going to be cracked. Now, if you really want to get into something even remotely advanced, you could try sessions type stuff that are sent out to the client from a PHP script. From there the server could ping the client and ask for session ID. If session ID is null or session ID doesn’t equal whats stored in the server’s database, then the client should be terminated. This is where your obfuscation techniques come in handy. You would really have to build your auth system into this bot, or else disabling would be too easy. Also, I think if you went towards a session type server, you’re getting out of the range of PHP’s sockets. Of course, you could always put on a cron job, but I suspect that would either lag your server, or reach the limits of PHP’s sockets.</p>
<p>I remember RichyT’s OCR. I think he had his programmer create a whole server for handling auths. The packets where encrypted and it worked efficiently. Perhaps thats what you would need. Something in Java or C#. I suppose our friends in the private server community could assist.</p>

<p>Are you planning on making a RuneScape-focused VM hack? Interesting, as that does seem to be where competent people are drifting anyway…so perhaps we can expect a generation of ‘bots’ that are both robust against Jagex and well-protected against crackers.</p>
<p>I haven’t looked at it much, but <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/jvmti/index.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">JVMTI</a> has been mentioned to me. It is apparently the next generation of the debug interface. Have you looked at that, or do you intend to truly hack the VM instead of using such tools as already exist?<br>
[/quote]<br>
Well not really planning, but thinking about approaches and playing around with it my mind. But in practice, I haven’t come much farer than hacking the source such that my machine compiles a nice JVM out of it. I started digging into the source but it starts getting rather complex if you come to point where the actual VM is launched. It takes a lot of time to get an overall understanding.<br>
Anyways, I’m not sure whether the interface you’re proposing brings enough power to realize everything I had in mind, but surely, you can do some nice things with it and its a good start. Later on, hacks could be added by extending this interface. Also easy to understand interfaces are always great because they pave an alternative way into understanding the JVM <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
But this takes time - time I currently cannot spare … but hopefully sometimes later[/quote]</p>
<p>JVMTI was my idea. It is going to be 3rd generation rs cheating. It is event based which means you have callback functions in your dll that are called whenever a specific event occurs within the running jvm instance. A field modification event, an object modification event, method enter event, method exit event and the list goes on. Here’s how simple it is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every update, you run a server side application which fetches the newly updated client and retreives all the fields you need for the bot to run (all you need is it’s name, signature and class its in (easily accessible with binary(BCEL) or source analysis)) and send them to your database.</li>
</ol>
<p>(My favorite)2. Usually you would attach a jvmti library to a jvm with the “-agentlib:mylib” argument passed when launching a your application. JVMTI comes with a sexy JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS environment variable that you can set so you can still run your jvmti lib to a java application embedded into your browser aka an applet. Which means this bot is runnable through the official runescape applet. A great plus in my opinion.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>You get your bot to query your database for the fields you need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever those fields are modified while running the game, an event is passed to your lib with its name, class, new value and other junk you don’t need. You run a sepperate thread which is constantly processing these fields into on screen coordinates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the sexiness of JVMTI and JNI you can send mouse events to the applet in 3 statements.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s just say in theorie this idea is flawless and I beleive JVMTI/JNI is now jagex’s number 1 enemy.</p>
<p>This solution is FAR easier then hacking the jvm. Out of the box thinking as its limits.</p>

Want to start a betting pool, how long until we manage to get a deob from JAGeX?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>You mean how long until we can bribe someone who works there to copy the source for us or how long until we can fix one of our various deobfuscation tools?[/quote]</p>
<p>Honestly, how hard is it to fix our deobfuscation tools? Someone who decently understands java and the jvm should be able to do it in a few hours of hard work. Obfuscation is only rearranging instructions and targets around so the decompiler can’t find any “valid” patterns to decompile (pattern as in…say a for loop). Find the obfuscated pattern, write a 10 line bcel hack and voila, the flow is back to as it should be.</p>
<p>Of course with my JVMTI idea, obfuscation is completly irrelevant to me now.</p>

whats rep?<br>

<p>Carful people, dont ask that question. Its a ban trap. Just like on rs if a mod asks you, are you using a bot?[/quote]</p>
<p>No it’s not. They aren’t asking for rep, they’re just asking what it is. Check out my guide in the Tips/Tweaks section.</p>

<p>One competent guy is enough for good a protection, the rest can code the remaining crap whatsoever. If I ever will feel like making a bot for rs again this is going to be a hacked VM anyway which is in C++, so, naturally, you can create sophisticated dependencies between protection and the VM in oder to make the crack non-trivial. Anyways, this way I don’t just waste my time, instead I will learn some new interesting stuff about VM implementations and dynamic code translation.</p>

Yea, but it rules out most of the “java gurus” here because x86 instruction set is way more complicated. Plus you have a lot more possibilities that you can do to protect your code. Think of self-modifying code, in-memory code consistency checks, funny pointer arithmetics and basically any other fancy stuff that goes crazy if someone tries to tamper with the code. Even advanced crackers will have their fun if they don’t know what they should look for.<br>
This still doesn’t mean it’s uncrackable, just harder.[/quote]</p>

Disassembling C++ really isn’t amazingly difficult, how do you think 99.9% of the no-cd cracks and keygens are produced… but I supposed you kind of have a point. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>

<p>OK, What’s wrong with SCAR? You mean besides the horrible inefficiency that comes with using a colour clicker, the fact you can only run one at the same time (without a VM which is also horribly inefficient), the fact that SCAR simply cannot DO everything bots can do… I need not go on. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
