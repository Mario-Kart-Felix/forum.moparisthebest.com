    <description>Hello, I&#39;m Kody. I&#39;m the head administrator over at iPlayRS, a part of the iPlayOG Network. Our network is fairly popular and we host a variety of private servers such as GunZ, MapleStory, Minecraft, and runescape. We have just recently opened up our Runescape server under the NetWork&#39;s Owner Nick, and the server&#39;s owner Logan. We have a lot on our hands and we are in dire need of a top notch coder for our 317/417 loading. We have a large network and are looking for expansion. We need someone who can fix bugs, add in minigames, and make the game worth playing. You will receive coder status on our forum and iPlayRS staff status with full control. Our server is currently ran on a Dedi and is online as we speak, as well as our website and forum.

Please contact me at KodyAmazing@Live.com , if you don&#39;t have msn then please either PM me or shoot me an e-mail if you&#39;re interested in this opportunity. Thank you!

              <p>Well, for one I posted that very late at night and was tired out of my mind. I am still very tired and heading off to class in a bit, if anyone needs further details please PM or E-mail me. As of now there will be no pay for the coder, this job is 100% voluntary. We are a professional network. Take the time to google iPlayOG as I do not post links on forums.</p>
<p>But, a few of OUR goals at iPlayRS is to have a stable community. We want our server to succeed in every way possible. I’m looking for a someone who is good with balancing out for the economy and item stats, that doesn’t require much or any coding skill what so ever.  A patient dedicated coder who can fix our bugs that our players find while playing, adding in shops mini-games etc. The coding norm. As I said before, this job is voluntary, there’s no guaranteed pay being issued.</p>
