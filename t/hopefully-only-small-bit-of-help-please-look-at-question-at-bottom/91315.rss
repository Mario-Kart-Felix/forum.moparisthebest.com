    <description>Hello everyone, im sure you have heard this a million times. I used the no-ip tut and i have made one. I have a source and edited, compiled etc... I have created a rule in my fire wall and all thats left to do is my router forwarding. I have tried EVERYTHING and I can&#39;t even get the log in page up. Can anyone help? Or what else can i do?. All help will be greatly appreciated.
Thank you very much. Broony.

Oh, i was told that i dont need to forward, just run server and people can play, is this true?</description>
