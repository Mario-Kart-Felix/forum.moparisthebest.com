    <description>I&#39;m not entirely sure why the other topic was locked. I understand this section is for advertising, and I&#39;m advertising for Geminus.

Sorry for the spam.

Just would like to point something out that I pointed out awhile back when the third stork was around (lol).

Who cares who&#39;s source code we&#39;re using? The FIRST private server, was Geminus.

Therefore, we aren&#39;t using &quot;havok&quot; source, or &quot;demonik&quot; source or even &quot;RSCA&quot; source. Everything is based off of Geminus.

That&#39;s my two cents. Aren&#39;t we all in this to make private servers better, and more stable?

Why are we trying to shut down other servers when players want to actually play on it? Personally my favorite was the server that Stork ran himself before getting into trouble with Jagex (circa 2005? I&#39;m not sure). Back then we didn&#39;t have owners DDoSing other servers in hopes to increase their player base.

On another note, when there is hear say that a certain owner had the DDoSing occur, what does it tell you about how they go about things? Personally, I will never play on a server who has to DDoS in order to get players.

That&#39;s my two cents. Thoughts? And once again, sorry for it being the wrong section (is there even a section for this kind of thing?)</description>

<p>Sorry, the first private server was based off Geminus.</p>
<p>If Geminus never came about, would we be as far into RSC development as we are? No, therefore, code and ideas for code is based off Geminus.</p>
<p>People have been wanting a team to be put together to make an amazing server. Just because a few don’t, doesn’t mean we all don’t. But I see where you’re coming from. I’ll correct my statement to: Aren’t most of us in this to make servers better.</p>
<p>And the bad DDoSing didn’t start until after the second stork was shut down, i.e. DDoSing to shut down servers, not just lag them.[/quote]</p>
<p>You live in lala land, Nuff said Geminus was not the first runescape classic private server at ALL there was plenty before that by baka and sliab and etc… There was even a private server for the engine of 174 (I remember that). You sir are just a kid trying to act like all knowledge is on your shoulders… You do not no anything what went on in them days nor will you get a team with to work with you</p>
<p>Why work on a really unstable source like Geminus when it will take you around 1-2 days to write a server using a API netty or mina… Saying that you most likely do not have the knowledge… Catalyst is programmed poorly for a netty server but that is what you expect from people who try dive deep into it with little knowledge of the API… Nuff said this post is useless so are you.</p>

<p>Sorry, the first private server was based off Geminus.</p>
<p>If Geminus never came about, would we be as far into RSC development as we are? No, therefore, code and ideas for code is based off Geminus.</p>
<p>People have been wanting a team to be put together to make an amazing server. Just because a few don’t, doesn’t mean we all don’t. But I see where you’re coming from. I’ll correct my statement to: Aren’t most of us in this to make servers better.</p>
<p>And the bad DDoSing didn’t start until after the second stork was shut down, i.e. DDoSing to shut down servers, not just lag them.</p>

<p>It has already been done in the classic scene. We are at the point of development where we really need to grind down on the stability of the server and making everything as efficient as possible. If this community were to put their minds together I think <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,449104.msg3295024.html#msg3295024" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"> Catalyst</a> Would be the best bet.</p>
<p>Its not that people are selfish. Everyone in the classic community has released something. Its the fact that we only have about 4 people here who know what they are doing and are doing it properly.</p>
