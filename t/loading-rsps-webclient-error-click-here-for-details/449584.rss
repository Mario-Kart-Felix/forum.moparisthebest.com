    <title>Loading RSPS webclient error click here for details</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/loading-rsps-webclient-error-click-here-for-details/449584</link>
    <description>My friend is hosting a rsps and its running pretty good for him. He has me and my other friend playing right now, but only my friend is playing. Everytime I try to load the webclient it gets pasted the spinning java stage thing, then after that it brings me to a white page and at the top left corner it says &quot;Error, Click here for Details&quot; what is happening? 

I tried downloading the client and all when I extract the files it works so I when I play the client it just has this loud sound doesnt even load up. So if you have any idea&#39;s on that please help please.

PLEASE, I REALLY NEED HELP 
Anyone have any idea&#39;s to what is happening please let me know</description>

              <p>That error means you’re either not able to download the cache, or something went wrong with the client.</p>
