<p>I couldn’t agree with you more I went on 2006Remade to talk to developers like a civilized human being and mod Toby and lee started spamming me and calling me fat irl and showing off their java skills, I asked them what a convention is they didn’t even answer, this remake is going down any time with those developers, Mod Tom is barley on anymore and Lee is acting like a smart ass with a telescope up his ass lol</p>

<p>It breaches no rules, you shouldn’t have trusted the source with someone such as this. If he gives credits where they’re due then there’s literally no rule at all in breach.<br>

He didn’t give proper credits and it’s 2006Scape wich is not allowed.[/quote]</p>
<p>Are you dumb, south park???<br>
He said this is a 2006scape source, which you are using, so don’t come in with your beloved lies, because your using an illegal source too.</p>

To be honest, I agree with Flavius, it was his choice at the end of the day, he’s done some pretty good work in the past, including Mezzyscape 508, which was fantastic and full of content, none the less, this is another great example of his work, so people can hate, but at the end of the day, it’s got a download count of 130, and a view count of 2400. And to be honest, I would’ve done the same thing if I were in Flavius’s position, other developers hating + irl problems, there’s got to be some set rules or some relationship before going on as a partnership 50%-50%, it was you’re own faults.</p>

Is not like Tom did anything more, Flavius got the source, I talked to Kronikz and he said that he Fixed the Source, Kronikz handed Flavius the source a while ago and he fixed it and got it working. He also fixed the Login Bug which allowed everyone to log in any account with any password.</p>

I’m just going to put my input in on this one since I used to work on them with this until I realized they all were a bunch of immature scrubs. Flavius (mezzyscape) strives to better himself in his Java knowledge and tries hard to contribute to whatever. Tom (South-Park) on the other hand has no understanding of Java since he couldn’t answer many simple questions about the fundementals of Java I asked him on skype. He gives orders while he sits back and follows tutorials and if he makes an error, Flavius and I were told to fix it. Flavius did most of the work and he has every right to release this since it is his work and Flavius was kicked off because Tom didn’t need him to do the work anymore. Now stop argueing and let people enjoy the release.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I’ve learned alot since then and I didn’t work because you were bossing me around, also [quote]has every right to release this since it is his work[/quote] It’s not all his work?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Proper Credits:</span><br>
RuneSoure Team- RuneSource ( The base of the source )<br>
2006Scape Team- All the content that is in the source<br>
Mezzyscape&amp;who ever helped- Login bug ( could login with any password ), maybe something else not too sure<br>
South-Park- Fixed Projectiles, DC bug ( you would get reset if you dced ), reset bug ( you would get reset if you tryed to login with wrong pass ), bulk drops, and some Npcs<br>
Zak BASHER- Fixed tree spirit ( would dc if it attacked you, it was missing the gfx and anim ), fixed some dupes, and some more stuff I can’t rember[/quote]<br>
I literally cried from laughing, you fixed projectiles? Let me explain what you actually did, you managed to get your hands on the Project RS06 Source that was leaked (The thread is Locked). You stole the Projectiles and fixed Mage and Range, if it wasn’t for Project Rs06 You would’ve used your shitty PI and continued with your 474. You know what frankly surprises me? Me and frank used <a href="http://2006remade.org" rel="nofollow noopener">2006remade.org</a> and I backstabbed him because he was a douche it turns out I would’ve been better off with him and the project would’ve gone much further. Me and Frank had you at our feet, you were begging to join the project and because I’m such a nice guy I destroyed frank to start a project with you, then you start calling yourself head developer. That’s when things turned around. You were willing to quit 2006Remade because you weren’t able to get projectiles fixed. Funny how a trash bag like you calls himself a coder.</p>
<p>EDIT: I got you the VPS, I got you the 2006Scape Source leaked from October 2012, I fixed the login bug which allowed the server to be hosted and players to log in. And yes Ahram is right I didn’t fix the player password not saving, AtomicInt did and I respect him for using his precious time to help little noobs like me. I got Mod Basher on the team. Then 2006Remade gets hacked and you pussies decide to blame everything on me, do I look like a hacker…?</p>
<p>My point is that if it wasn’t for me and Kronikz_ 2006Remade would be ours. And yes we used your name you know why? Because you already quit, we had the 2006Scape you were stuck with RS317 Source I gave you.</p>
<p>EDIT2: One more thing I forgot to throw out there. Thomas tell me one thing that you did on the source besides pretending to fix Projectiles, guess what you didn’t do jack shit Zak and I did pretty much all the work, the players were begging you to add the Slayer shop you didn’t even care. You were too lazy to fix a frikkin shop. And i’m pretty sure you didn’t even fix the bulk drops. The DC and Reset bug… The DC bug was caused by NPC Projectiles and Such, Reset bug never existed, the player accounts sometimes rewrote themselves because I added an extra thing in PlayerSave.java.</p>
<p>So yea, zak and I did most of the work on the server, Zak fixed the Drop Bug which was caused by players visibility of the dropped items. Thomas your remake is going to fall apart, all of you can’t make it, even if I were on your team still we would’ve had no chance, the server was growing too quickly the botters, and hackers were gonna come, we would’ve had no chance of fixing the Packet Injection.</p>
<p>And as far as I can see, <a href="http://2006Remade.com" rel="nofollow noopener">2006Remade.com</a> Wasn’t even able to fix their webclient. And your server is offline, great job.</p>
<p>Gf 2006Remade.</p>
