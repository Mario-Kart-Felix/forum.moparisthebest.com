    <title>317 deob mopar&#39;s client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-deob-mopars-client/535431</link>
    <description>Hey, I&#39;m currently using Mopar&#39;s renamed 317 deob.

By default it cannot be setup web applet usage. It works perfectly fine when I jar and sign it, but when one tries to use the webclient it throws this error; java.lang:reflect.invocationtargetexception

I thought perhaps I had done something to the client that would make it throw the error so I tried and sign a completely untouched deob and it threw the same error, I also tried and sign Galkon&#39;s refactored client and it worked perfectly fine.

Does anyone know what edits I&#39;ll have to make for it to work as a webclient?</description>
