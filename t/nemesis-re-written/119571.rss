    <description>Yup, since I had no help AT ALL with my errors, I couldn&#39;t fix it, so I decided to keep working on my special server.

1. New source
2. Added forums
3. Full Specials
4. DDS, Maul, Dhally hit double spec!
5. Almost all skills work, including:
Attack
Strength
Defence
Range
Prayer
Magic
Runecrafting
Hitpoints
Agility
Thieving
Crafting
Fletching
Smithing
Fishing
Cooking
Firemaking

Need some tutorials for the rest of the skills:
Slayer-Guess I can just make certian NPC&#39;s give Slayer XP.
Construction
Better Fletching-I mean 100%, with the interfaces too, I have 99% right now.
Farming
Hunter
No-IP:
I believe I got no-ip working, need it tested first in a bit.

6. Added the best welcome screen possible.
7. ELEMENTAL ROBES
8. FULL Edgeville
9. FULL Fally
10. FULL Catherby (MUST FISH OWN FOOD!)
11. Figher Torso Minigame
12. Dark Bow (1/3 chance of doing double dmg, special always does double +extra dmg!)
13. Almost FULL fishing! (You can fish without the items to fish with though, like a harpoon etc.)
14. Almost NO lag!
15. New client
16. Better background
17. SKULLING!!!
18. Need to use client, or you can&#39;t see text, damage, or your HP, and of course, the skulls!
19. Skill Capes-Get when you get 100 in a skill
20. Max skill is 100
21. Max combat is 127
22. Client will be released shortly, but it won&#39;t be editable, it&#39;ll be closed source, and the port will stay at 43594
23. You can enter your own IP on the client

Pics coming soon!

Expected up-time:July 10th, 2007
^
Expected if I can get 19/22? skills working, I think 22 is the total amount of skills possible.

Number of working skills:
16/22?
