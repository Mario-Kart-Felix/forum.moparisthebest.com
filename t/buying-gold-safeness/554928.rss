    <title>Buying Gold safeness?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/buying-gold-safeness/554928</link>
    <description>Friends and I were looking into buying gold, but since I&#39;m fairly new back into RS2007 my friend they started actually tracking and banning for people buying it by tracking the bots.


Anyone buy gold, or know how safe it is anymore? I&#39;ve done it before (pre-2009) and never had an issue.</description>
