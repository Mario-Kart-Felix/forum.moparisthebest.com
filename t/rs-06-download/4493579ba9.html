<p>So I just took a look, and it seems like a lot of things aren’t there to the extent that the 06 guys implied they were (npc spawns and npc defs to be exact in this example). Is this an out of date release or did they just not get as far as they implied?</p>

<p>This is actually their alpha source. Blake released Runesource under the GPL license which practically carries the same implications. Also they used a few classes from Graham which carry that license up above. It’s missing a few pieces, although I’m not sure where npc spawns and npc definitions went so I assume if it isn’t there then it was never in the source folder.</p>
<p>Edit: This is about two weeks old from now. Start of July was when this got leaked.</p>

<p>Yes, they’re still in alpha. I can only place this source as the one that was being hosted publicly (after the fact that they made people donate) for awhile. Oh really. I thought they had some already done.</p>

        <p>I am the original creator and copyright holder of RuneSource, the only base used for 2006Scape (not Hyperion).

The only GNU license which would require that it remain open-source is the AGPL, which Moparisthebest himself knew when he asked that Osiris be released under the AGPL instead of the GPL for this very reason.</p>
<p>The modified code is under copyright of 2006Scape and myself, and the original code is protected by copyright held by me. Not only is this obvious copyright infringement via release without the copyright holders consent, but even if it were AGPL (which it is not and never has been and never will be) licensed then we would have to be the ones to release it - and if we didn’t, instead of you releasing it, you’d actually have to take us to court and force us to release it as you are not a copyright holder and have no right to release it.</p>

<p>The mods don’t like Vault or 2006Scape and so are trying to justify allowing this leak by saying it’s licensed under the GPL. The GPL does not require that the source is released - it only requires that if a binary distribution is made the source made available as well. No binary distribution was ever made, this is a flat source leak. Not to mention it has to be done by the copyright holders and not by others (no you cannot compile and make the server available for download and then link to the source because you do not have the rights to make a distribution). This is way too immature for us. I have contacted Moparisthebest and I have faith that he will have the maturity to fix this.</p>

No binary distribution was ever made, this is a flat source leak. Not to mention it has to be done by the copyright holders and not by others (no you cannot compile and make the server available for download and then link to the source because you do not have the rights to make a distribution). This is way too immature for us. I have contacted Moparisthebest and I have faith that he will have the maturity to fix this.[/quote]<br>
of course he will, he can usually handle these situations easily. Yes I see that being bias can be a problem on these forums, especially in this situation where the validity is questioned, and it will probably be taken down accordingly.<br>
As to everyone else, I’d grab it before it’s gone.</p>

        <p>We all know that Vault has about 5 DMCA notices in his inbox from Jagex, and I have a feeling if you guys attract more attention trying to get your source taken down it would actually be worse for you.</p>
<blockquote>A.1. Mandatory conditions:
 You grant [u][b]any recipient[/b][/u] of the software the following rights (irrevocably and for the duration of the copyright):

 without liability for direct or indirect damages.
This disclaimer might not be valid under the applicable law. In such case GPLv3 states that the local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability will apply.
 You cannot charge for the software licence, but you can charge for each copy or for warranty, support, services etc.
 If you hold any patents necessary for the use of the software, you grant at no cost a licence on these patents.
 Along with any binary copies of the software, you must distribute a copy of the GPLv3 and of the Source Code1 unless you opt for an alternative listed in section 3 B.
 If you do not hold sufficient rights on (all parts of) the software to grant the rights set forth in GPLv3, you cannot distribute the software under GPLv3.</blockquote>I'm sorry, what part of this says that the source cannot be released if someone gets a hold of it? Nobody is arguing that the source NEEDED to be released, we're saying that there is no reason that it should be taken down. You used an open source license, there's no grounds that I can see in the license text that says you have permission to make the copyright closed source (meaning that anyone that has the open licensed product is not allowed to redistribute it), as that would kinda defeat the purpose, yes?
<p>Moparisthebest has specifically made a post about this in the staff section, saying we don’t want to get involved in taking down ‘leaked’ sources, unless you can prove you own 100% of the code (in a closed source license) <span class="bbcode-b">and</span> you had a legally binding non-disclosure agreement with the person that released it.</p>
<p>He may make an exception because it’s you, blakeman, but I don’t think it would be on legal grounds unless I’m misreading the GPL.</p>
<p>And as for the immature hacking stuff with ‘Toil’, that is completely unrelated to Moparscape and I’d personally rather that not be brought here. This is a good source so of course it’s going to be released if it gets found, how is that immature? The only immature part is the squabble between toil and your other staff administrators (and the wording of the OP :P).</p>

<p>Except Toil wasn’t a recipient, he was a thief. Not to mention I can literally change the license if I want to because I am the original creator and sole copyright holder. You know for a fact that the only reason this hasn’t been removed is because you, among others, do not like Vault. Don’t even try to sugar coat it. I have lost a lot of respect I had for you today. You aren’t even a programmer, and you start interpreting software licenses like you know what you’re doing?</p>
<p>I work in the industry, I own a software company, we have a lawyer and I’ve dealt with issues like these before. I know how these things work. If a lawsuit were to arise from this, you too could be held liable for damages incurred by 2006Scape for allowing this to continue when you have been informed that this is indeed copyright infringement when you had in your power the means to stop it.</p>

        <p>Doesn’t matter if you change the license, because once a source gets distributed under GPLv3, any downloaded copies inherit the license. So when Vault originally downloaded it, he licensed it with GPL and that cannot change.</p>
<p>And this has nothing to do with Vault, he’s not here anymore. There is no reason to remove this source, and I lost a lot of respect for you too trying to bully us to do so just because you’re making money off of this and it’s a big server.</p>
<p>If you want to sue, do so against me, I’d be very interested in seeing what happens in a civil case with a minor. I happen to know you can only sue a minor if you’re in the same state or both states have the same parental liability statue in place. And then you’d have to prove financial loss, so good luck with that with a runescape private server.</p>
