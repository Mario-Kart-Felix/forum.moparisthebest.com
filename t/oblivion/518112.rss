    <description>So, just wanted to get peoples&#39; opinions on Oblivion. Before I actually saw it, I heard from people that it sucked and that it was terrible. I honestly thought it was a good movie. A mind fucker yes, but still had a good story line. The only thing I was disappointed in is that we didn&#39;t actually see another race, just a floating pyramid computer thingy. :o

              <p>I’ve never seen the movie, but the trailer looks interesting enough.<br>
The part where they create people to follow the orders reminds me of another movie I saw a while back, called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi2968781081/?ref_=tt_ov_vi" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">The Island</a> (that’s a bad trailer, there’s more on YouTube)</p>
