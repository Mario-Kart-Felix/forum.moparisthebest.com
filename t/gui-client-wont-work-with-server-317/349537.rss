    <title>Gui Client Won&#39;t Work With Server (317)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/gui-client-wont-work-with-server-317/349537</link>
    <description>Whenever I try connecting to my server with a gui client it automatically kicks me out, no error connecting to server message or anything ...

Can anyone help with this? Because I really want to add in some tabs to forums and stuff, and I really need the hp and prayer rings.

Thx in advance</description>
