    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/this-isnt-advertising-it-is-wondering/22773</link>
    <description>I was wondering how to advertise my forums. Is there any good places to advertise?  This isn&#39;t advertising,*points at sig* that is. This is basically asking if there is a place I can advertise my forums for free?</description>

              <p>It’s not because it’s not being advertised enough, it’s probably because people don’t want to join your forums(no offence, seriously).</p>
<p>Almost all large forums, such as this one, has everything we need. Why join a site with 15 members?</p>
<p>But, I managed to weild over 600 members for my old forums. We would have had at least 2000, but we pruned members who didn’t post within 2 months of joining. People often joined just to watch the video. Anyways, what I did was post it on large gaming forums that had advertising sections or no advertising rules, etc… Just present yourself extremely professionally. If all you have is some runescape talk forums, then it’s going no where. What you really need is decent hosting and a domain and the most important thing is something unique and available for the members. Mopar’s forums are very popular because of moparscape(and of course, many of us just came since it was the next best forum to kaitnieks).</p>
<p>The first month or two of my forums we had no more then 50 members. The more user’s joined, the faster it will grow. Most people do not want to join a forum with 15 members, they want one that at the very minimum will have a few hundred, or a few thousand.</p>
<p>Trust me, google adsense isn’t going to get you many more members and will probably leave a big hole in your pocket. I believe the minimum payment is 5 cents per click, so everytime someone clicks your link you will have to pay 5 cents. All I can recommend is spread the word around on some large forums with flexible advertising rules and in a professional manor.</p>
<p>edit* Looked around your site… See you have WoW private servers and stuff. You may want to start by gathering as much content as you can and posting it on your forums. Then members will have a reason to join so that they can see guides and such.</p>
