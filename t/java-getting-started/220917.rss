    <description>Hello, I have the book &quot;Sams Teach Yourself Java 6 in 21 Days&quot; I was wondering if any of you have read this book and know if it&#39;s any good. I&#39;m looking to learn the language faster than the book intends you do; so I was hoping some of you could shed some light on whether or not this book is a good one to start off with or if it&#39;s a dud, thank you and please post. :)</description>

I know there is Eclipse and NetBeans for Ubuntu Linux (wich is what im regretfully using) but rite now im using Geany, and it seems to be working out well for the trials. So im going to ditch the book and try your suggestion and do the tutorials on the site, thank you all for your reply’s.<br>

You’re welcome. I am not discouraging the use of books, but from my past experience, it’s not fun/can be learned a lot quicker from perhaps practicality use of the tutorials.[/quote]</p>
<p>What do you mean by “a lot quicker”? I can learn the language in under 21 days with the tutorials?</p>

              <p>I got to page 101 on the “Java for dummies” ebook and thought “wat”. If your going to learn, skim through the tutorial looking at the code examples <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">on the official Java tutorials</a>, then recreate the code examples, I found it much easier learning by trial and error than learning by someone telling me their experiences with trial and error. Eclipse or Netbeans really make life easier when your starting out.</p>

<p>It’s not possible to learn the language in 21 days completely. Think of the book as a starting block for something more.
