    <title>Making players to use YOUR client to log in only</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-players-to-use-your-client-to-log-in-only/372583</link>
    <description>Now, i&#39;m sorry if I&#39;ve made a mistake posting this here in the Server Help board... but even though it obviously seems like client help or whatnot, I&#39;m sure this has alot to do with server side work... So it was quite tricky to choose between the two boards.

Anyways moving on... can anybody please help me allow people to only access my server using MY client?
By the way, to those who are interested... I did use the search thingy.

Thank you.</description>
