    <title>[PI] Getting Server Online</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-getting-server-online/398069</link>
    <description>This is my first PI server I have started to work on.

So I just downloaded Exion as my base. In his post he said to change the IP all you need to do is going into client&gt;client.java and find [code=java]server = &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;[/code] Then change that to your IP. Although I did this and now I can&#39;t connect. Is there something server sided I need to do aswell? I went into my server files and searched &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;, &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;, &quot;localhost&quot; and nothing showed up. So currently I have been running the server on the IP &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;.

If anyone has had this problem with Exion before or could point me in the right direction as to what I need to do that would be great.</description>

<p>So are you saying that you can’t find “server = 0.0.0.0”, or that you can’t change it?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I have found it and I have changed it, but when I change it to my no-ip it won’t let me log in. So i left it as" 0.0.0.0".</p>
