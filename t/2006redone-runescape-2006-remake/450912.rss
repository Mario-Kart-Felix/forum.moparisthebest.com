Shame to see you stop working on it, would have been amazing when finished!<br>
Quick question - Are you releasing your work to the community to see if they can fix any problems/errors?<br>
Anyway, great work.</p>

So that’s the current problem. Btw i typed this out on my phone if it looks weird.</p>
