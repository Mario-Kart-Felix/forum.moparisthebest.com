ok once you looked on the site and see what i see. you will understand better. i did exactly what it said on the site except for portforwarding and doing the no-ip thingy. but i download the source cheezscape and i copy and paste the information provided on the site exactly on the cheezscape compile and runeserver. i clicked on edit and paste exactly what was on the site. 
but when i did all that my source wouldnt work. 
when i double click on compile this is what i get 
&quot;client.java:10656: error: non-static method killServer() cannot be referenced fr

                        server.killServer();
