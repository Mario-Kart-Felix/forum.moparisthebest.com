    <description>I am having a problem with my server i cant connect to using no-ip i have set up no-ip correctly because it was working before. I have port forwarded correctly, i double checked. My server was working correctly and then one day it just stopped thought maybe my ip changed but its the same my firewall is still programmed correctly any 1 got any ideas. My only conclusion is that maybe my router is going bad iv&#39;e had some other problems with it.</description>
