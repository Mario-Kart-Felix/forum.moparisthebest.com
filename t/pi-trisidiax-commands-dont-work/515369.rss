    <description>Hey guys i have been doing sooooo much work that its not funny on trisidiax&#39;s sourse it is ony and i am ranked 70 something on runelocus starting to get a very good player base too :) It has now come to the time to redo the commands and i have found that there are 3 commands files? 1 is that .class and the other two are java?? the issue im having is that most of the commands in them dont work and when i add my own command nothing it wont work nothing has changed??? if i delete on of trisidias commands compile and run the command will still work ingame??? even though all traces of it are gone? I would really love some help.</description>

              <p>well lol lets see what ur options are here about this matter…</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>copy paste both commands.java files and paste it on ur desktop as a backup and then try deleting one and run and compile and see if it works, if it does then there you go if not then second option…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>try using the one with a larger file size, like example: if one of them are 500kb, and the other is 312kb, use the 500kb one usually that should work man! GOODLUCK</p>
</li>
