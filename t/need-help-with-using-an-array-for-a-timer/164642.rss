    <title>Need help with using an array for a timer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-using-an-array-for-a-timer/164642</link>
    <description>Alright what I&#39;m trying to do is create a timer for respawning objects. I need this for my woodcutting skill. After you cut down any tree it is replaced by a stump and a timer should start counting a certain amount of time before the tree respawns. I can&#39;t use one timer for every tree because the timer would keep changing and it would be all messed up. I could make more timers which would be a waste of space and would take me forever. I thought it would be easier to use an array. It would be easier if I could actually get it to work. My problem is making an if statement that checks for the next array that isn&#39;t in use. Here&#39;s what I have so far:

[code]public int[] respawntimer = new int[100]; //Declaring the integer as an array
ReplaceObject2(objectX,objectY,6951,-1,10);//Remove object completely(example)
if(respawntimer[0] != 0) {
int i = 0;
i++;
respawntimer[i] = 60;[/code]
This doesn&#39;t actually do much but it&#39;s all I have so far.
It only checks the 0 array though and if it&#39;s in use it adds to the array and the next array is now in use.
Instead of checking if 0 is in use or not I&#39;m trying to check if any of the arrays are in use or not and than I want it to use the next array that is 0 or is null.

Thanks for reading and hopefully you can help me. ;)</description>
