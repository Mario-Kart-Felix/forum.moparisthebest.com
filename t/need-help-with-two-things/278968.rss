              <p>Open up player.java, search for</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"> public int q1 </code></pre>
<p>Then you will see all the quests with either nothing next to them or = 0.</p>
<p>Change all the quests to this…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"> public int q1 = 15; </code></pre>
<p>Basically just add = 15 to the end of it and remember to keep the ; at the end.</p>
<p>Also your second question… Encryption is there for a reason it’s to protect you incase your server somehow gets out into the open.<br>
However you can remove it but i suggest not to.</p>
