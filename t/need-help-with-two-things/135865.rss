    <description>Hello, First i want to say thanks for reading my topic. Even if you cant help, thanks for trying :)
[u]
[b]Problem 1[/b] [/u] - I need an anti mass code.. something like if you click over a certain speed, within a few seconds, like 10 clicks within 2-3 seconds, than it says in txt4 &quot;oh god, im massing&quot; and adds a black mark to there account.

[u][b]problem 2[/b] [/u] - I need to add a Woodcut that has a timer, like when you cut the tree, all you have to do is click once, and it cuts maybe 30 logs, than says &quot;the tree has run out of logs&quot; or somthing.

PLEASE  help me if you can, otherwise, thanks anyways.</description>
