    <title>Server advertising issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-advertising-issue/279129</link>
    <description>i&#39;m not sure where to post this but i cant find any ware else to post.
when i go to advertise my server on the status page it said it is approving but it never post it, ive been trying all day and i no my server works because i was just on with a few friends. Ive tried other stuff like this:
[img]http://rs2status.freehostia.com/status.php?world=ServerName&amp;host=Lowerscape.no-ip.info&amp;port=43594[/img] it shows offline when i know its on because im logged on under my server ip. so i was wondering if there might be something wrong in like my server.java file or something that prevents finding the status of the server.
Any ideas?</description>
