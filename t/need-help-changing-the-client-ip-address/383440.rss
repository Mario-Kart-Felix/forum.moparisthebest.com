    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-changing-the-client-ip-address/383440</link>
    <description>Hey everyone I need help changing the client&#39;s IP address I search in client.java and change the IP to mine but there are two different sets of IP&#39;s and I&#39;m not sure which one to change :/ Here&#39;s the codes:

if(myPrivilege &gt;= 2 || server.equals(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;) || 1 == 1) {     &lt;----first line of code with an IP address

//server = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;;       &lt;---- second one
		server = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;;

Which one do i change so people can connect to my IP?

My no-ip is lost-legacyv1.no-ip.biz

Please put that where it&#39;s suppost to go, I will pay whoever fixs it and it works $5.00 + Admin. You can also teamview me, just add my msn: DillonX10@hotmail.com!

Please please please help me! This is DSPK source/Client!

Come on please help!</description>

Cut this shit out. 3+ threads of the same thing. You’re breaking a rule by posting this, especially 3 times.<br>
Offering money = big nono. Also, how the hell can you not fix this?<br>

Lmao Cole. i dare you to start readed pages 1-5 on here. people post all over the place. over and over again. i have a few times too, but thats because my posts get pused so far back no one reads them[/quote]<br>
When your post goes on the 4th-5th page,   then maybe no one will answer it, so its ok to repost, maybe this time giving more info on what you need help with so you can get that help.  This person’s post went down 2 spots and he reposted. Its against the rules.</p>
