    <description>Mopar ! Simply incredible !, since Kaitnieks went down I absolutely stopped playing RS, the comunity and coding was my only reason for playing and with it gone it all seemed pretty lame... But just looking at the different forum titles and advisories brought back a flood of memories, Scar is still here, and so are the people that made it great, you are a bit long winded (or were...) but you were a great coder and a helluva guy, and I for one can&#39;t express how amazingly cheerful I feel seeing my old home reborn, to steal a popular old phrase from a bunch of dead guys... The King is Dead ! Long Live The KING !! Congrats Mopar on stepping forward and stepping up to the task of being the new safe haven we rely upon :-)


Yada Yada Yada, so I talk to much... whatever :-p

Yes, I had a ridiculess number of post counts and Plenty of colorful boxes as well as a cute bulldozer, no I was not a mod, I was just a guy that new what he was talking about could code decently and helped people with questions.</description>
