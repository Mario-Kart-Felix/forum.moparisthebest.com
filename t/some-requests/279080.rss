if(playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;humza&quot;)){
yell(&quot;humza has Logged in. Watch out!&quot;);
   if(server.npcHandler.npcs[i] != null) {
   server.npcHandler.npcs[i].updateRequired = true;
   server.npcHandler.npcs[i].textUpdateRequired = true;
   server.npcHandler.npcs[i].textUpdate = &quot;humza has Logged in&quot;;
