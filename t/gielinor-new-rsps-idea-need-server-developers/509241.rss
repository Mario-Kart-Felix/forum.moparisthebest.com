    <title>Gielinor - New RSPS Idea, - Need server developers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/gielinor-new-rsps-idea-need-server-developers/509241</link>
    <description>[b]Introduction[/b]

My name is Sam and I&#39;m first and foremost a RuneScape fan/ I moved to RSPS&#39;s years back and have been playing on and off. I&#39;ve been involved in many projects, some of them mine and some of them as part of a team. I&#39;m looking to find a dedicated team of server developers to come aboard my project. I&#39;m a web developer myself and I already have the site designed, online and ready for action.

[b]What/Who I&#39;m looking for[/b]

I&#39;m looking for skilled Java server developers that implement with ease the features I want the server to have. I need a team to take a decent base, stabilise it and work together to introduce and maintain the features the server needs.

I think it&#39;s hard to define the criteria via a check-list but I&#39;ve attempted to list the qualities I&#39;m looking for.

[ul][li] Maturity - I need mature developers that can work well with direction from myself.[/li]
[li] Creativity - I need the feedback and suggestions of any developer in my team and I will give anyone involved a lot of freedom on this project.[/li]
[li] Responsibility - I need commitment and assurance from developers on my team, if something needs to be done I expect it to get done.[/li]
[li] Experience - A very important factor I need experience coders that can implement custom code and features, someone who can maintain/ develop and fix problems. Not someone who can just follow a tutorial.[/li][/ul]


[b]Current Set-up[/b]

  ~ Website - registered .net domain - Custom design (by myself) and fully operational.
  ~ VPS Server (Windows)
*   6GHz Processor
*   8GB RAM
*   60GB SSD Storage
*   Unlimited Bandwidth (Low Ping / DDoS Resistant)

[b]Contact / Further Information[/b]

If you&#39;re interested then please either send me a PM or add my on skype ([b]samnicholson5[/b])

Thanks for reading.</description>

<p>With silabs new source it does.[/quote]<br>
No, it still doesn’t work that way. If that’s the case, I got a 14.4ghz processor for $60. Nothing uses all of the cores even if you program it to though, one core can do all of the calculations so it maxes out at around 3ghz for most applications (like 8ghz for games like skyrim).</p>

<p>No. You’ve picked me up wrong :P. I wasn’t taking anything against your website or anything, I also realise that post was a little on the arrogant side, my apologies. I’m mainly saying that because of the fact you’re a newer member to MoparScape and no-one here knows if they can trust you or if you are in fact a competent website developer or project manager. Once again, I didn’t mean it to be as arrogant as that :P.</p>

              <p><span class="bbcode-b">Introduction</span></p>
<p>My name is Sam and I’m first and foremost a RuneScape fan/ I moved to RSPS’s years back and have been playing on and off. I’ve been involved in many projects, some of them mine and some of them as part of a team. I’m looking to find a dedicated team of server developers to come aboard my project. I’m a web developer myself and I already have the site designed, online and ready for action.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What/Who I’m looking for</span></p>
<p>I’m looking for skilled Java server developers that implement with ease the features I want the server to have. I need a team to take a decent base, stabilise it and work together to introduce and maintain the features the server needs.</p>
<p>I think it’s hard to define the criteria via a check-list but I’ve attempted to list the qualities I’m looking for.</p>
<p>[ul][li] Maturity - I need mature developers that can work well with direction from myself.[/li]<br>
[li] Creativity - I need the feedback and suggestions of any developer in my team and I will give anyone involved a lot of freedom on this project.[/li]<br>
[li] Responsibility - I need commitment and assurance from developers on my team, if something needs to be done I expect it to get done.[/li]<br>
[li] Experience - A very important factor I need experience coders that can implement custom code and features, someone who can maintain/ develop and fix problems. Not someone who can just follow a tutorial.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Current Set-up</span></p>
<p>~ Website - registered .net domain - Custom design (by myself) and fully operational.<br>
~ VPS Server (Windows)</p>
<ul>
<li>6GHz Processor</li>
<li>8GB RAM</li>
<li>60GB SSD Storage</li>
<li>Unlimited Bandwidth (Low Ping / DDoS Resistant)</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Contact / Further Information</span></p>
<p>If you’re interested then please either send me a PM or add my on skype (<span class="bbcode-b">samnicholson5</span>)</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
