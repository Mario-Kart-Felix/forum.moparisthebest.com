    <title>Downloads Section</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/downloads-section/444042</link>
    <description>The downloads section needs a little help and fixing. For one, any registered member can post anything in the section whether it be about help, a download, a virus, or something not even related in any way... This is very annoying, if the download is a virus then a lot of the unsuspecting members who are most likely new will lose their computer, we have no clue how many people have downloaded a virus because of this site, when we should know that no one has. Two, back before we did the forum upgrade the tutorial section was highly moderated, all tutorials had to follow the format and rules of the section and then had to be approved to be seen by other members. I propose we add this to the download section so we can keep things clean a lot easier then having 10-30 threads that don&#39;t even belong or follow the rules of the section.

Comment with any hate against the idea, or love for it. Or just spam....</description>

Problem is, the new members won’t even make an attempt to find the rules of the site, let alone read a disclaimer about how it’s your own risk.  I see where you’re coming from, but I think it’ll just invoke more spam about how they got infected or keylogged and how mopar now owes them shit…<br>
Plus there’s one guy who posted the same virus using the same topic layout at least 5 times.</p>

              <p>Personally, I think it should be moderator approved topics.  Mostly because it ensures that no one will get infected before a moderator can lock the topic.  I know this increases the workload of moderators, however all they really would have to do is make sure it’s relevant to the board and ensure it’s not an obvious advertisement, virus, etc.</p>
<p>If people can’t wait 1 day for their topic to appear, they shouldn’t be posting it anyway, as it’s probably hybrid pvp with a few commands and they just want praise.</p>
<p>Yes, it will add a small amount onto the moderators workload, but think about how many servers are typically released a week, usually around 3 or 4 is what I’ve been seeing recently (I don’t get on near as much as I used to, though, so meh).  So, it’s not like they’ll be swamped with reading threads every day, it’ll only take a few minutes each, as they don’t even have to read the whole topic, just skim it enough.</p>

<li>
<p>You would need a lot of work moderating that area of the forum, to make sure for spam, virus’s, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you think that people could put a virus scan or something, a screen shot of said virus scan could be easily faked.</p>

<p>We don’t allow torrents on this site so if you asked for something I think it would be hard to get, atleast for a legitamite torrent.</p>

              <p>Alright so, I agree with silabsoft. The real problem here is accessibility. By adding forced moderation to that section, everyone will be at a severe inconvenience, not to mention that the staff would have a significantly higher workload. Instead, all we can really do is post disclaimers (as she said) and encourage everyone to use the ‘report to moderator’ feature as much as possible. If you have and no moderator reacts to it within a few hours, please post such a concern in this section so we can figure out something else to do.</p>
<p>I personally think a change this large would put the users at too much of an inconvenience, though.</p>

              <p>Okay here’s another solution sort of… isn’t fool proof but still.</p>
<p>First off, as far as I know you have to be in root access on linux to even get technically  a virus of any kind… so maybe a  linux tutorial on how to download etc and suggest people use that?<br>
Secondly, a tutorial on virtualization so that way nothing is saved at the end of the session.(it all gets wiped at end of that  session )<br>
Thirdly, While you are right about the scanners not catching everything it could very likely catch 60-70% of what people on here would try to do to people. I would still suggest having a  scanner I’d rather feel safe with 60% safety than 0% safety honestly.<br>
Fourthly, ^ the suggestion about a notice mod above<br>
Fifthly, Perhaps make a special group  and the willing members who have proven themselves trustworthy in the eyes of the staff could  help to  sort out the malicious items when it first is posted.<br>
Sixthly, ( apparently that isn’t a word xD ) perhaps somebody  can make a general guide on "how to look out for malicious content " “suggested security features” etc.</p>

<p>I see your point and agree to a point, this would help with keeping the work load low the same and also lower liability on the forum. But I can’t see how a mod like that would do much of anything considering a lot of the members of this community don’t even read the rules, nor do they even read threads, they just download and run most of the time, and then come back here crying about a virus they got.</p>
