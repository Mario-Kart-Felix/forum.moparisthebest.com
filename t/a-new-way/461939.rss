    <title>A new way</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-new-way/461939</link>
    <description>[s]I was thinking about an adventurous way of RunescapePS&#39;s that could still include multiplier interaction. Instead of never being original like errr PvP server, spawn servers, Economy servers. All that stuff that is in every server. I want to still use runescape but making a whole new way of it. Like redoing the maps, new objects, items, and interfaces. It will take a lot of work your going to say, right now im just working on the idea.
Well here&#39;s what I have been thinking.

I know there has been one person who has thought like me and made the MW2 runescape private server. I wasn&#39;t thinking anything like that because that&#39;s based off of another game. I was thinking like You start a quest that leads to another quest etc. Like you have missions that you could do around the world with other people. like the more monsters you kill with your partners you get a heart, use the heart to pick a skill level to advance in. Also I had an idea like if your deep an a dungeon you have a portal scroll and you click it and it teleports you to your house. Theres are basic ideas so far but I was wondering what you thought about it and if you could recommend anything...[/s]

I would completely dismiss the topic with names like that. That is probably why it got no attention.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span>: I also want to do something along the lines of what you describe, something inspired by Skyrim. A RPG within a RPG; I think that’d work well.</p>
