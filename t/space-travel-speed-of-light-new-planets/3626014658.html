Do you believe in &amp;quot;aliens&amp;quot;, or ways to settle on to new planets? 

Do you think we can bend space itself to travel faster then the speed of light?

<p>no we can never go faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>we can bend space to make the distance shorter therefore making it a faster trip<br>

lets put it in everyday use here. lets say you have to drive 20 miles to work.in this photo above we have to stay on your 20 mile drive to work. if you could bend the road(or space) so much that you only have to drive 1 mile. like in the photo below you would still are ariving at the same place. but seeming to get there way faster.<br>

<p>Exactly thank you.<br>
If time travel was possible, people would go back in time, invest all their money, then wait thousands of years for it to grow. Then people in the future could take their newly acquired riches and give it to their former self back in time where it’ll be worth more. You don’t hear about that all the time, now do you?</p>

<p>Hi, My real name is 923210B. In the year 2089 we created a machine that could take us back in time. There was 5 of us who were working on the project. The further we got towards success the more our differences came out. They wanted to use time travel to manipulate time for there own pleasure. So I grabbed a grenade and the blue prints and ran into the machine blowing it up. Somehow I ended up here in this time. Somehow the machine must of sparked and sent me back into time.</p>
<p>See … it could of happened… but maybe hidden or destroyed. We will never know.<br>
[/quote]So, you can time travel; yet, you can’t even use correct grammar?[/quote]<br>
I think people from the future suck at English.</p>

        <p><em>prepares for long post</em></p>
<p>K aliens, really? Obviously we are talking about the contemporary version of aliens (ones in humanoid form, more intelligent and technologically more sophisticated, etc). There was a post in the ID&amp;D section of my site talking about this very thing. As someone pointed out, the chance of another planet being in the absolutely perfect position to sustain the mass amounts of life that Earth does is incredibly low. It’s just how the universe is mapped out. However, when it comes to contemporary aliens, you have to go even a step further and determine the chance of <span class="bbcode-i">intelligent</span> life existing elsewhere in the universe. The calculated chances are so low you basically consider them 0. As time progresses, the chance could as easily increase as decrease. The universe is constantly expanding, so planets are evolving in ways of circulatory motion and perhaps even life evolution, but you’d need an infinite amount of time in order to recreate intelligent life (according to such probabilities), and the universe unfortunately has an ending to it.</p>
<p>Time travel is a whole different ballgame (I’m not even sure how these two topics were brought together, but that’s okay!) For anyone disagreeing with the existence of time as the fourth dimension, I encourage them to read up on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Einstein’s special theory of relativity</a>, which explains a lot of the complexity of time, by which you can derive the existence of the fourth dimension. To put the ideas behind the theory into summary, you are always moving through time, hence why it is a dimension. People then took that to the next level and figured because you can travel forward, surely you can travel backward. I find it entirely typical for people to want to change the past. They make mistakes and they want to undo them. I’ll get into that later though.</p>
<p>The fourth dimension can be terribly complicated. Using another principle of Einstein, you cannot move faster than the speed of light. Combining the two ideas, it’s thought that, if you can manage to reach the speed of light or even surpass it (despite being conjectured as impossible), you can actually move faster than time. If you go into some vessel that can carry you the speed of light, then travel one year in a straight line. After that year, you turn around and travel the same speed back to Earth. You would have aged 2 years, but the Earth would have aged around 200 years (you can look up this theory to verify it; I likely have my facts a bit off). Such ideas make traveling forward in time possible (not feasible or possible technologically), but traveling backwards is an entirely different story.</p>
<p>There are other theories which I am less familiar with. It’s said the Universe is flat and moves in an ever-expanding planar direction, thus remaining flat. Based on big bang theory, everything in the Universe is moving outward with a slowly declining rate (once everything stops expanding, the opposite occurs and the Universe starts shrinking). The idea is that the Universe expanded initially at a rate close to the speed of light (or perhaps faster, if I understand the theory correctly), so that we are able to receive the light from the early existences of the Universe. This is partially where an expanded theory comes in, where the actual states of the Universe are ever expanding as well. If one is able to bend the flat “fabric” of space into a horseshoe shape, they’d be able to travel through the middle and come out either later or earlier than they previously were. This is pretty much the only concept I’m familiar with in regards to traveling backward in time.</p>
<p>Now I’m going to talk about even funner stuff: the repercussions of time travel. I think people often underestimate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Butterfly Effect</a>. When discussing time travel, I like to utilize the Butterfly Effect literally. Imagine an actual butterfly in 1972. The butterfly is noticed by a five-year-old girl who is crying in her room because her parents are fighting. The butterfly calms her down and leads her to develop a strong attraction to the beautiful things of the earth. She begins to write diaries and journals, always applying her life to nature. She eventually learns how to connect nature to society, becomes a politician, and becomes the first women president of the United States in 2016.</p>
<p>I have to divert a bit here. There was one theory I learned a while back regarding the every dynamic fifth dimension. If you consider the fifth dimension to be each and every reality a form of us resides in, then a fifth dimension is created every single time a decision is made. Thus, when changing the past, one little “nick” in the space/time continuum creates a separate reality, or changes the current reality indefinitely (both are the same idea). But, if you have ever seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Back to the Future</a>, Doc explains how their changing the past created separate realities but, at one point, the realities joined back together or intersected each other (if I recall correctly). In a single reality system, then the idea would be that one little change only made a speedbump in time, but everything diverted back to its natural order.</p>
<p>Going back to the five-year-old who becomes the first woman president of America. If the above holds true and someone goes back in time to kill that butterfly, she may find her inspiration in a dog instead, or maybe in a bird. If you have ever read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_Machine" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">The Time Machine by H.G. Wells</a>, then you may recall the main character does everything in his power to save his fiancé, but he sees her die dozens of times in different ways. This implies an entirely inverse concept: that you cannot change the future whatsoever; that it will always revert back to its natural order. Going to the movie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Butterfly_Effect" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">The Butterfly Effect</a>, the main character is able to constantly change his feature during periods of “blacking out.” In the TV Series <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_(TV_series)" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Heroes</a>, Hiro is able to change the future throughout the series, on both major (the bomb in New York) or minor (saving Charlie’s life) scales. On other instances, he isn’t able to change the future at all (trying to save the employee who copied his butt 142 times and kills himself by jumping off the Nakamura building).</p>
<p>Time theory becomes so immensely fast and verbose it’s better to just say “we can’t change the future, so we won’t and won’t think about it.” I’ve been considering a lot of time theories recently, mostly due to rewatching the seasons of Heroes. I find it difficult to believe how the butterfly effect can be applied on such minimalistic scales, but then I started to theorize using ideas of psychology. People have a natural tendency to revert to their old form, even after encountering something new. But every person, animal, or insect makes an impression on people’s consciousnesses and subconsciousnesses. I don’t consider it possible to have a “light” butterfly effect.</p>
<p>I want to briefly try to show how the fifth dimension is infinitely possible or entirely impossible. I have a theory of randomness that states “the indeterministic and chaotic tendencies of the electrons of an atom cause for minor variations which reverberate on a macro scale, creating randomness in all elements of the world.” Based on this idea, our very neurons would have constant randomness, changing every state every moment of every period of time. If true randomness exists (as this theory states), there is no fate or predestined outcome. If fate does not exist, how can time traveling into the future exist? If we travel into the future with no fate, every time we look into the future we will see something different. If the future is constantly changing, this means the already-written past will perhaps change in a result of the future changing, creating more realities and making it impossible to chose which one you want to be in (where the past and future realities are continuous and connected). The ever-changing states of the electrons create an infinite amount of realities, because they are more than just decisions; they are changes of state. Because there is an infinite number of realities, I find there is only one reality because time travel can’t exist with an infinite number of realities based on the random change of the electrons and “all the elements of the earth.”</p>

<p>Aliens are REAL. The other night i saw a Ufo. So did my parents. We was watching it fly. It was flying slowly then it suddenly disappeared (went hyperspeed n flew off). This is true. And btw it was glowing orange, like a flame colour. I was told it was a Metorite but it was not flying downwards. It was only flying horizontally ! Not lieing …</p>

Your talking about the parallel universe theory. (Took your two paragraphs and explained it in a sentence)[/quote]</p>
<p>The part where the past creates a new reality would be parallel universe theory. The rest of it, discussing how it’s not possible to have multiple realities due to an infinite existence of realities and the part where the multiple realities/universes are merged into one primary, constant reality don’t follow that theory. But yea, I wish I remembered that theory when I was posting. :rolleyes:</p>

<p>I’m sorry your unable to take care of someone, but most people know how to.[/quote]<br>
Let’s say your in your room and you forgot to do your bed when you woke up. You hope that another person does it, but your mom finds out. She gives you a warning. The next day, you don’t do your bed again. Your mom punishes you with no TV for a week. Then you imagine “Why couldn’t I just of done my bed? It would be much better then not watching TV for a week…”<br>
This is the same with our planet. If we dont do something quick, <span class="bbcode-b">then we will pay for what our ancestors were to lazy to do.</span>If our ancestors were alive, they’d be like “What the hell did we do. We could of just volunteered to clean up a little bit and this would be much better”.

<p>For anyone who remembers the movie “war of worlds” (newer one from mid 2000’s), remember why the Aliens died? They where used to our environment that we’ve adapted to live in. Maybe in a few millions year, we’ll be able to properly digest dirtier things, or remove the salt in salt water from some extra organ inside of us, or breath CO2 without worry.</p>
