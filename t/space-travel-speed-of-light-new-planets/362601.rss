Your talking about the parallel universe theory. (Took your two paragraphs and explained it in a sentence)[/quote]</p>
<p>The part where the past creates a new reality would be parallel universe theory. The rest of it, discussing how it’s not possible to have multiple realities due to an infinite existence of realities and the part where the multiple realities/universes are merged into one primary, constant reality don’t follow that theory. But yea, I wish I remembered that theory when I was posting. :rolleyes:</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p><em>prepares for long post</em></p>
<p>K aliens, really? Obviously we are talking about the contemporary version of aliens (ones in humanoid form, more intelligent and technologically more sophisticated, etc). There was a post in the ID&amp;D section of my site talking about this very thing. As someone pointed out, the chance of another planet being in the absolutely perfect position to sustain the mass amounts of life that Earth does is incredibly low. It’s just how the universe is mapped out. However, when it comes to contemporary aliens, you have to go even a step further and determine the chance of <span class="bbcode-i">intelligent</span> life existing elsewhere in the universe. The calculated chances are so low you basically consider them 0. As time progresses, the chance could as easily increase as decrease. The universe is constantly expanding, so planets are evolving in ways of circulatory motion and perhaps even life evolution, but you’d need an infinite amount of time in order to recreate intelligent life (according to such probabilities), and the universe unfortunately has an ending to it.</p>
<p>Time travel is a whole different ballgame (I’m not even sure how these two topics were brought together, but that’s okay!) For anyone disagreeing with the existence of time as the fourth dimension, I encourage them to read up on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Einstein’s special theory of relativity</a>, which explains a lot of the complexity of time, by which you can derive the existence of the fourth dimension. To put the ideas behind the theory into summary, you are always moving through time, hence why it is a dimension. People then took that to the next level and figured because you can travel forward, surely you can travel backward. I find it entirely typical for people to want to change the past. They make mistakes and they want to undo them. I’ll get into that later though.</p>
<p>The fourth dimension can be terribly complicated. Using another principle of Einstein, you cannot move faster than the speed of light. Combining the two ideas, it’s thought that, if you can manage to reach the speed of light or even surpass it (despite being conjectured as impossible), you can actually move faster than time. If you go into some vessel that can carry you the speed of light, then travel one year in a straight line. After that year, you turn around and travel the same speed back to Earth. You would have aged 2 years, but the Earth would have aged around 200 years (you can look up this theory to verify it; I likely have my facts a bit off). Such ideas make traveling forward in time possible (not feasible or possible technologically), but traveling backwards is an entirely different story.</p>
<p>There are other theories which I am less familiar with. It’s said the Universe is flat and moves in an ever-expanding planar direction, thus remaining flat. Based on big bang theory, everything in the Universe is moving outward with a slowly declining rate (once everything stops expanding, the opposite occurs and the Universe starts shrinking). The idea is that the Universe expanded initially at a rate close to the speed of light (or perhaps faster, if I understand the theory correctly), so that we are able to receive the light from the early existences of the Universe. This is partially where an expanded theory comes in, where the actual states of the Universe are ever expanding as well. If one is able to bend the flat “fabric” of space into a horseshoe shape, they’d be able to travel through the middle and come out either later or earlier than they previously were. This is pretty much the only concept I’m familiar with in regards to traveling backward in time.</p>
<p>Now I’m going to talk about even funner stuff: the repercussions of time travel. I think people often underestimate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Butterfly Effect</a>. When discussing time travel, I like to utilize the Butterfly Effect literally. Imagine an actual butterfly in 1972. The butterfly is noticed by a five-year-old girl who is crying in her room because her parents are fighting. The butterfly calms her down and leads her to develop a strong attraction to the beautiful things of the earth. She begins to write diaries and journals, always applying her life to nature. She eventually learns how to connect nature to society, becomes a politician, and becomes the first women president of the United States in 2016.</p>
<p>I have to divert a bit here. There was one theory I learned a while back regarding the every dynamic fifth dimension. If you consider the fifth dimension to be each and every reality a form of us resides in, then a fifth dimension is created every single time a decision is made. Thus, when changing the past, one little “nick” in the space/time continuum creates a separate reality, or changes the current reality indefinitely (both are the same idea). But, if you have ever seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Back to the Future</a>, Doc explains how their changing the past created separate realities but, at one point, the realities joined back together or intersected each other (if I recall correctly). In a single reality system, then the idea would be that one little change only made a speedbump in time, but everything diverted back to its natural order.</p>
<p>Going back to the five-year-old who becomes the first woman president of America. If the above holds true and someone goes back in time to kill that butterfly, she may find her inspiration in a dog instead, or maybe in a bird. If you have ever read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_Machine" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">The Time Machine by H.G. Wells</a>, then you may recall the main character does everything in his power to save his fiancé, but he sees her die dozens of times in different ways. This implies an entirely inverse concept: that you cannot change the future whatsoever; that it will always revert back to its natural order. Going to the movie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Butterfly_Effect" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">The Butterfly Effect</a>, the main character is able to constantly change his feature during periods of “blacking out.” In the TV Series <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_(TV_series)" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Heroes</a>, Hiro is able to change the future throughout the series, on both major (the bomb in New York) or minor (saving Charlie’s life) scales. On other instances, he isn’t able to change the future at all (trying to save the employee who copied his butt 142 times and kills himself by jumping off the Nakamura building).</p>
<p>Time theory becomes so immensely fast and verbose it’s better to just say “we can’t change the future, so we won’t and won’t think about it.” I’ve been considering a lot of time theories recently, mostly due to rewatching the seasons of Heroes. I find it difficult to believe how the butterfly effect can be applied on such minimalistic scales, but then I started to theorize using ideas of psychology. People have a natural tendency to revert to their old form, even after encountering something new. But every person, animal, or insect makes an impression on people’s consciousnesses and subconsciousnesses. I don’t consider it possible to have a “light” butterfly effect.</p>
<p>I want to briefly try to show how the fifth dimension is infinitely possible or entirely impossible. I have a theory of randomness that states “the indeterministic and chaotic tendencies of the electrons of an atom cause for minor variations which reverberate on a macro scale, creating randomness in all elements of the world.” Based on this idea, our very neurons would have constant randomness, changing every state every moment of every period of time. If true randomness exists (as this theory states), there is no fate or predestined outcome. If fate does not exist, how can time traveling into the future exist? If we travel into the future with no fate, every time we look into the future we will see something different. If the future is constantly changing, this means the already-written past will perhaps change in a result of the future changing, creating more realities and making it impossible to chose which one you want to be in (where the past and future realities are continuous and connected). The ever-changing states of the electrons create an infinite amount of realities, because they are more than just decisions; they are changes of state. Because there is an infinite number of realities, I find there is only one reality because time travel can’t exist with an infinite number of realities based on the random change of the electrons and “all the elements of the earth.”</p>

Don’t you people understand the most obvious part?! If time travel was possible, why has no one come from the future to stop us from poor decisions? Bring a sniper from the future and shoot Hitler, or avoiding shit like Desert Storm or Vietnam? If people could time travel, this world could be a utopia.<br>
Then there is shit like people getting in the way, like going back in time to snipe the guy who was going to snipe Hitler, and as you can see it could go on and on.<br>

<p>We don’t know if there are time dimensions or not. Therefore your theory/statement is invalid.[/quote]</p>
<p>Exactly that’s why it is invalid.<br>
Other planets that support life - completely possible. I don’t doubt this.<br>
Time travel - impossible.</p>

              <p>I’ve heard about this, it’s always possible but like someone else said, it will be a long time before we can travel that far into space. Let alone it takes 9months to go to the moon?</p>
