    <title>5 Years/4 Years, 365 Days</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/5-years-4-years-365-days/166696</link>
    <description>Well, in 5 years (My time, 11:22), the magnetic poles will switch for those who don&#39;t know. We won&#39;t die, but electrons won&#39;t power things (I think), and satellites especially won&#39;t work. I believe we&#39;re taking a new course (Earth), I think in our galaxy. I&#39;m going by what I heard.

So in 5 years (Or 4 years and 365 days [not counting leap year] for your time), life will be changed a lot. Do what you want that won&#39;t be there then!

<p>If this is true, it’s great. I think the human being needs to go back to their roots, no computers, no transportation, nothing. No need to worry/care about people from other places on earth, just care about your own little society. This is a huge improvement to the world.</p>

<p>To your post i would agree but no video games, Tv, I wouldnt have friends because i live in a 5 people neighborhood because my parents like the country and like it to be quiet… My dad would commit suicide my mom would have no reason to go to work and sleep all day… Un-balance in the world of my house! I could still look forward to school then though lol. Teachers would be pissed bout not being able to turn lights on or they’d have to river wash there clothes. Rofl.</p>

<p>the poles have switched loads of times in the earths life (and thats like what, a few billion years or something)</p>
<p>the evidence is the ocean floor. when new ocean floor is created (if you dont know this ur an idiot) the magnetism slightly magnetizes the rocks due to iron and other metals in it. This creates banding of N S N S N S rocks with that magnetic field.</p>

<blockquote>Magnetic lines of force near Earth's surface become twisted and tangled, and magnetic poles pop up in unaccustomed places. A south magnetic pole might emerge over Africa, for instance, or a north pole over Tahiti. Weird. But it's still a planetary magnetic field, and it still protects us from space radiation and solar storms.</blockquote>

              <p>thanks xxlegit. At least someone has searched the web or has been to Earth Science class.</p>
<p>I mean everyone knows that the magnetic field flips, but it does not happen frequently.</p>
<p>And when it DOES flip again, nothing will happen to energy… nothing will happen to technology, just there will be higher numbers of radiation since the field isn’t there to block it. Meaning more people will die of cancer.</p>
<p>Goto Earth Science class, and you can learn this.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>The field will come back and start blocking the solar radiation again, but compasses will be pointing you south on a map now instead of north <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>EDIT 2:</p>
<p>There are plenty of sources of information for this on google. Plus images of data and the field flipping.<br>
<img src="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v441/n7093/images/441552a-i1.0.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Thats the magnetic field flip, and right now the field is “flowing” out of the south pole and going around the earth into the north pole backl to the core and back to the south pole. Creating a loop. This blocks most of the solar radiation from the suns “burps”</p>
