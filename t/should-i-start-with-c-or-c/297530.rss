    <title>Should I start with C or C++?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/should-i-start-with-c-or-c/297530</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;m really wondering which I should start with.
I was thinking C at first but I&#39;ve been told it has less libraries and that C++ is generally easier.
Anyone want to suggest one?</description>

<p>I agree with lawl on this one.  I would recommend you start with OOP programming with C++, and afterwards you can learn C if you want, which won’t be that different or hard for you.[/quote]the thing is, he’s already learned oop. he said he knows java. which means, he is in the perfect moment to learn C</p>

i think the opposite; learning c++ first will scar you with bad habits in memory management</p>
<p>just as learning java first will blind you from the fact that there is a memory handling concept<br>
[/quote]<br>
not really. c++ abstracts a bit of memory handling away from you, makes it harder to fuck up, but still teaches you how to do it.[/quote]fucking up is what makes you strive to learn</p>
<p><span class="mention">@op</span>: i really really recommend c, but since its ur choice at the end, feel free to learn c++ first then regret it</p>

              <p>yes, C has less standard libraries, but enough for you to operate correctly. learning C is a good experience seeing as you learn so much about memory handling in general. not to mention the fact that C runs faster than c++, although the speed differences are barely notable.</p>
<p>once you’ve learned C, C++ will come naturally</p>
<p>so ya, C.</p>
