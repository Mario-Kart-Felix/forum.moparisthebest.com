    <title>Help with Models / Cache (HUGE PROBLEM)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-models-cache-huge-problem/391859</link>
    <description>My client is a Bluurs Client.
A long time ago, I was able to add new items without errors. They were showing the right model on the client.

But now, I don&#39;t know what happened. Each time I try to add new ones, it will appear as a junk on the client (like a wall, whatever). This is very weird.

Also:

- When I do add models or add model *model # here* commands, they say it works on the client (it&#39;s showing the thing in the chatbox and disconnect and relog me). But after when I load the client again (once I exit the client and run it again), I get the black screen with the 5 steps to do when it says &quot;Loading Models&quot;.

Can anyone help please I&#39;ve been trying for age to fix that and I&#39;m unsuccesful.

Thank you ! :)</description>

<p>Are you still using the same client that previously worked when adding models?</p>
