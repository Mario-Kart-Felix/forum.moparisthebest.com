    <title>[MySQL] Creating an Automatic User-Submitted Price Guide/List [PHP]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mysql-creating-an-automatic-user-submitted-price-guide-list-php/434119</link>
    <description>There&#39;s an every-changing economy in the real world, as well as on runescape private servers, I&#39;m new to moparscape but i&#39;ve been doing website design professionally for the past 5 years, this tutorial is going to show you how to easily create an automatic price guide for your runescape private server (works with any server version), users will input data for the price guide and the server will automatically do some mathematical equations to get the average of the recent price changes for that item. Giving a fairly accurate price of the item each time. There&#39;s not much pre-hand information that you will need to know to do this, just pay attention and be able to copy and paste and follow simple directions.

VII. Common Errors and Questions

I. Requirements
There are a few requirements that you will need to setup this automatic price guide, I&#39;ll list them below and where to get them.

- MySQL
MySQL is a program used for storing databases, tables, and information for websites and other programs. If you have highscores, you&#39;ve more than likely used MySQL already for creating them, if you don&#39;t have it, You can download it from the MySQL official website located at [url=http://www.mysql.com/downloads/cluster/]http://www.mysql.com/downloads/cluster/[/url], But there is an easier way to get this and other necessary programs through a program called XAMPP, which i will go over in a later part of the tutorial.

- Apache
Apache is a web hosting application that is used for displaying a personal website to the world, sometimes not personal though, its pretty much just used for hosting your website 24-7 and directing the web browser correctly to have the website run correctly, Once again like MySQL, XAMPP will help you install Apache.

- Php 
Php is a programming/coding language that is used with almost every website for creating basic functions that may not seem so simple, You will also be able to install php with XAMPP automatically, what i will go over later.

- Ability to Copy and Paste
This tutorial really isn&#39;t that hard, all you have to do is concentrate, copy, and paste. And if you have any problems with the set-up of this, you can just post a comment below and i will help you with it ASAP

II. Getting Apache, MySQL, Php, and PhpMyAdmin
Note: If you have the things above listed or you have a Webhost with them install, you can skip this part and move on to Part III. 

These three programs and tools are necessary for getting this price list to work, If you have a webhost, you can cross off Apache and Php, seeing as they come pre-installed usually. Now lets get to MySQL, MySQL is a database manager and you&#39;d have to set it up on your webhost and sometimes purchase it. If you&#39;re looking to host the price list off of your vps (not recommended) You&#39;ll need to download and install XAMPP, XAMPP is a tool that has the following tools in it that will help you install them:

- Apache 2.2.21
- MySQL 5.5.16
- PHP 5.3.8
- phpMyAdmin 3.4.5

These four tools must be installed before moving on further. You can download XAMPP from [url=http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/xampp]http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/xampp[/url] I&#39;m not going to be going over on how to install XAMPP at the time though, i will come back and re add this part tomorrow, this message will only be showing for a short period of time. 

III. Creating Databases, Tables, and Initial Data
Assuming that you have the tools already install that i went over previously, or you have XAMPP installed and set-up, we are going to move on to Creating the Databases, for doing this we will be using PhpMyAdmin, I personally will be using an Arvixe Web Host Control Panel, that is currently for a different server, but this is just for demonstration purposes. 

First off, we&#39;ll need to get to PhpMyAdmin, if you&#39;re logged into your webhosting control panel, you can do this easily by finding &quot;PhpMyAdmin&quot; Somewhere on your list of tools and programs. For me on Arvixe Control Panel, it is located here (See Image)

[IMG]http://i40.tinypic.com/33o1c92.png[/img]

If you&#39;re using your own web host or XAMPP you can get it by going to [url=http://localhost/phpmyadmin]http://localhost/phpmyadmin[/url] Now, you may be presented with a log-in screen, by default the username is &#39;root&#39; and the password is &#39;password&#39;. In some cases, there is no password. After you have logged in to phpmyadmin you will be presented with a screen similar to the one below. 

[IMG]http://i43.tinypic.com/5oibut.png[/img]

Now you&#39;ll need to create a new database called, &#39;prices&#39;. Follow the picture instructions below to see how (Its pretty simple):
[IMG]http://i41.tinypic.com/206oqye.png[/img]

Now after you&#39;ve created the database you&#39;re going to want to create a new table called, &#39;items&#39; with 4 fields. Have the following fields/rows set-up like this: (Also follow on-image instructions; you need to scroll right and make &#39;id&#39; Auto_Increment/A_I and the Index, &#39;PRIMARY&#39;)

[IMG]http://i40.tinypic.com/w0s21f.png[/img]

After having this all filled in, click on &#39;Save&#39; and you&#39;re done with creating columns, 
MySQL holds the Databases, The databases hold the tables,
When you have tables, you have columns and rows, the columns tell the username, price, email, ip address, and other fields, the rows are the data that has been inputted. Now that we have created some columns, lets get started with the User Interface that users will use to input information and view already inputted information.

IV. Graphical User Interface and Php Program Functions
The users aren&#39;t going to be able to put in any information without being able to have a form to enter data into, you&#39;re now going to be needing to upload some files to your website host or wherever your website is hosted from, i would recommend creating a new directory on your website&#39;s root index called, &#39;prices&#39; and then uploading these files to them, below i&#39;m going to be going over the files and what each of them do.

- index.php
This is the main page that will be displayed to users, .php is a file extension telling the web browser that its an php file, so that it can read it correctly. This page will have the actual price guide on it, for everyone to see (with the optional form to have the form below it)

- insert.php
This file is for the actual form that&#39;s going to be inputting the information into the MySQL database and saving it there (After going through insert_ac.php)

- insert_ac.php
This file has the information that allows the web browser to connect to the database, if it has the correct information to do so, this is also the page that will give a success page if everything goes well.

Now, there is some data in the files that you will need to change, i&#39;m going to post the code as whole below and then go over what sections do what, and what sections you need to change.

index.php
[code]&lt;?php
$connect = mysql_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;DATABASE_USERNAME&quot;, &quot;DATABASE_PASSWORD&quot;) or
die (&quot;There is an error connecting to the MySQL server&quot;);
mysql_select_db(&quot;items&quot;);
$quey1=&quot;select * from items&quot;;
$result=mysql_query($quey1) or die(mysql_error());
?&gt;
&lt;body bgcolor=&quot;#1C1C1C&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Note:&lt;/font&gt; This price guide is completely made&lt;/br&gt; up from users, what you put in will benefit &lt;/br&gt;the community, everything is in the form of&lt;/br&gt; (m) or (Million) not (billion) if something is &lt;/br&gt;more than 999m, please make sure you put &lt;/br&gt;1000m and not 1b. 1.4b would be 1400m and &lt;/br&gt;so on. Ip Addresses are logged for security &lt;/br&gt;reasons, and we can backtrack ip addresses.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Instructions:&lt;/font&gt; Enter the Item ID and the &lt;/br&gt;price in the field underneath the list, the &lt;/br&gt;ID can be found to the left of the name.&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;table border=1 style=&quot;background-color:#F0F8FF;&quot; &gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Item Number&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Item Name&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Price&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;?php
while($row=mysql_fetch_array($result)){
$a = array($row[&#39;p1&#39;], $row[&#39;p2&#39;]);
$division = array_sum($a) / 2;
$num=mysql_numrows($result);
echo &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;;
echo $row[&#39;id&#39;];
echo &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;;
echo $row[&#39;name&#39;];
echo &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;;
echo &quot;$division&lt;/&gt;m&quot;;
echo &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot;;
}
echo &quot;&lt;/table&gt;&quot;;
echo &quot;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;iframe src=&#39;insert.php&#39; scrolling=&#39;no&#39; frameborder=&#39;0&#39; width=&#39;300&#39; height=&#39;200&#39;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&quot;;
?&gt;
[/code]

There is the top row that you are going to need to change, you are going to need to change this line of code:
[code]$connect = mysql_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;DATABASE_USERNAME&quot;, &quot;DATABASE_PASSWORD&quot;) or [/code]

Usually, &quot;localhost&quot; stays the same unless your database is hosted somewhere other than your own server or webhost, sometimes it can be an ip address such as, &quot;123.45.67.89&quot; In that case you&#39;d change &quot;localhost&quot; to &quot;123.45.67.89&quot;. Secondly, you need to change &quot;DATABASE_USERNAME&quot; to your own database username, which generally is &quot;root&quot; and you also need to change &quot;DATABASE_PASSWORD&quot; to your database password, once again, generally is &quot;password&quot; or &quot;root&quot; (In rare cases).

Now that you&#39;ve gotten index.php done, lets do insert.php .. There isn&#39;t any editing that needs to be done, it just needs to be saved in the same directory as index.php and insert_ac.php

insert.php
[code]&lt;table width=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;form name=&quot;form1&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;insert_ac.php&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td colspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update a Price&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;71&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;301&quot;&gt;&lt;input name=&quot;id&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;id&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Price&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;input name=&quot;p1&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; maxlength=&quot;4&quot; id=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td colspan=&quot;3&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; name=&quot;Submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;[/code]

Now for the final file, called insert_ac.php, once again there is some more information that you need to change for this file, pretty much the same information as index.php

insert_ac.php
[code]&lt;?php

$host=&quot;localhost&quot;; // Host name 
$username=&quot;DATABASE_USERNAME&quot;; // Mysql username 
$password=&quot;DATABASE_PASSWORD&quot;; // Mysql password 
$db_name=&quot;DATABASE_NAME&quot;; // Database name 
$tbl_name=&quot;items&quot;; // Table name

// Connect to server and select database.
mysql_connect(&quot;$host&quot;, &quot;$username&quot;, &quot;$password&quot;)or die(&quot;cannot connect&quot;); 
mysql_select_db(&quot;$db_name&quot;)or die(&quot;cannot select DB&quot;);

// Get values from form 
$id=$_POST[&#39;id&#39;];
$name=$_POST[&#39;name&#39;];
$p1=$_POST[&#39;p1&#39;];
$p2=$_POST[&#39;p2&#39;];


// Insert data into mysql 
$sql=&quot;UPDATE $tbl_name SET p1 = &#39;$p1&#39; WHERE id = &#39;$id&#39;&quot;;
$result=mysql_query($sql);

// if successfully insert data into database, displays message &quot;Successful&quot;. 
if($result){
echo &quot;Successful&quot;;
echo &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;
echo &quot;Refresh the page to see changes&quot;;
}

else {
echo &quot;ERROR&quot;;
}

// close connection 
mysql_close();
?&gt;[/code]

Now you&#39;ll need to change these three lines:
[code]$username=&quot;DATABASE_USERNAME&quot;; // Mysql username 
$password=&quot;DATABASE_PASSWORD&quot;; // Mysql password 
$db_name=&quot;DATABASE_NAME&quot;; // Database name [/code]

It should all be the same as what you entered in the index.php, and if it isn&#39;t, you&#39;re doing it wrong. The database name should be &quot;Prices&quot; and the Table Name should stay as &quot;items&quot;.. After you have changed the information in the 2 files and have the 3 of them saved correctly, all in the same directory, you&#39;re ready to move on to the next step, what really is just going to http://localhost/prices
or http://yourwebhost.com/prices to view your automatic price guide. However, you wont see any information being displayed, you can easily input more items and starter prices to the database / price guide by going into your MySQL through Phpmyadmin and going to the database and then to the &#39;Items&#39; table, while you&#39;re there, click &#39;SQL&#39; at the top of the page, Sometimes it says &#39;Query&#39; Instead of &#39;SQL&#39;. You&#39;ll be presented with a window like this:
[IMG]http://i42.tinypic.com/5nrllz.png[/img]

In the text box simply put in the following code and press &#39;Go&#39; to add the item and its start value to the database
[code]INSERT INTO `rprices`.`items` (`id`, `name`, `p1`, `p2`) VALUES (NULL, &#39;Item&#39;, &#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;);[/code]

Here&#39;s a list of 50 general items (rares, primal, rings, torva, virtus, pvp armour, etc.) to get you started with your pricelist

I hope you&#39;ve enjoyed this tutorial, there is a lot more that i&#39;m going to be adding in the future, i&#39;ll go over it in my checklist below.

VII. Common Errors and Questions
More Errors and Questions will be added as people have different problems, i&#39;m going to go over the programmed error messages though below.

Error Message:
[code]There is an error connecting to the MySQL server[/code]
Meaning: This Error message is broadcasted to the Viewer when the page is loading and the Browser cannot connect to the MySQL Server, meaning you have connection information wrong somewhere, i would advise you to go over this line of code located in index.php:
[code]$connect = mysql_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;DATABASE_USERNAME&quot;, &quot;DATABASE_PASSWORD&quot;) or[/code]

Error Message: [code]cannot connect[/code]
Meaning: This means that the Web browser cannot connect to the MySQL database, this happens when trying to input new information in the table, after you click, &#39;Submit&#39;. To fix this, you&#39;ll need to re-check these three lines in insert_ac.php
[code]$host=&quot;localhost&quot;;
$username=&quot;DATABASE_USERNAME&quot;; 
$password=&quot;DATABASE_PASSWORD&quot;; [/code]

Error Message: [code]cannot select DB[/code]
Meaning: This happens when you click the &#39;Submit&#39; and the Web Browser tried to connect to the MySQL and succeeds, but then it cannot connect to the database, or the table with-in the database, this usually happens because you type the Database name or Table Name wrong in the code, or they have not been created. Revise these two lines in insert_ac.php
[code]
$db_name=&quot;DATABASE_NAME&quot;; 
$tbl_name=&quot;items&quot;; [/code]
Also Note: Do not get &quot;DATABASE_USERNAME&quot; confused with &quot;DATABASE_NAME&quot;. &quot;USERNAME&quot; is what connects to the MySQL, &quot;NAME&quot; is the actual Database name that is contained with-in the MySQL.</description>

              <p>There’s an every-changing economy in the real world, as well as on runescape private servers, I’m new to moparscape but i’ve been doing website design professionally for the past 5 years, this tutorial is going to show you how to easily create an automatic price guide for your runescape private server (works with any server version), users will input data for the price guide and the server will automatically do some mathematical equations to get the average of the recent price changes for that item. Giving a fairly accurate price of the item each time. There’s not much pre-hand information that you will need to know to do this, just pay attention and be able to copy and paste and follow simple directions.</p>

<p>I. Requirements<br>
II. Getting Apache, MySQL, Php, and PhpMyAdmin<br>
III. Creating Databases, Tables, and Initial Data<br>
IV. Graphical User Interface and Php Program Functions<br>
V. Checklist / To Come<br>
VII. Common Errors and Questions</p>
<p>I. Requirements<br>
There are a few requirements that you will need to setup this automatic price guide, I’ll list them below and where to get them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>MySQL<br>
MySQL is a program used for storing databases, tables, and information for websites and other programs. If you have highscores, you’ve more than likely used MySQL already for creating them, if you don’t have it, You can download it from the MySQL official website located at <a href="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/cluster/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/cluster/</a>, But there is an easier way to get this and other necessary programs through a program called XAMPP, which i will go over in a later part of the tutorial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apache<br>
Apache is a web hosting application that is used for displaying a personal website to the world, sometimes not personal though, its pretty much just used for hosting your website 24-7 and directing the web browser correctly to have the website run correctly, Once again like MySQL, XAMPP will help you install Apache.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Php<br>
Php is a programming/coding language that is used with almost every website for creating basic functions that may not seem so simple, You will also be able to install php with XAMPP automatically, what i will go over later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to Copy and Paste<br>
This tutorial really isn’t that hard, all you have to do is concentrate, copy, and paste. And if you have any problems with the set-up of this, you can just post a comment below and i will help you with it ASAP</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>II. Getting Apache, MySQL, Php, and PhpMyAdmin<br>
Note: If you have the things above listed or you have a Webhost with them install, you can skip this part and move on to Part III.</p>
<p>These three programs and tools are necessary for getting this price list to work, If you have a webhost, you can cross off Apache and Php, seeing as they come pre-installed usually. Now lets get to MySQL, MySQL is a database manager and you’d have to set it up on your webhost and sometimes purchase it. If you’re looking to host the price list off of your vps (not recommended) You’ll need to download and install XAMPP, XAMPP is a tool that has the following tools in it that will help you install them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apache 2.2.21</li>
<li>MySQL 5.5.16</li>
<li>PHP 5.3.8</li>
<li>phpMyAdmin 3.4.5</li>
</ul>
<p>These four tools must be installed before moving on further. You can download XAMPP from <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/xampp" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/xampp</a> I’m not going to be going over on how to install XAMPP at the time though, i will come back and re add this part tomorrow, this message will only be showing for a short period of time.</p>
<p>III. Creating Databases, Tables, and Initial Data<br>
Assuming that you have the tools already install that i went over previously, or you have XAMPP installed and set-up, we are going to move on to Creating the Databases, for doing this we will be using PhpMyAdmin, I personally will be using an Arvixe Web Host Control Panel, that is currently for a different server, but this is just for demonstration purposes.</p>
<p>First off, we’ll need to get to PhpMyAdmin, if you’re logged into your webhosting control panel, you can do this easily by finding “PhpMyAdmin” Somewhere on your list of tools and programs. For me on Arvixe Control Panel, it is located here (See Image)</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i40.tinypic.com/33o1c92.png" title="33o1c92.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i40.tinypic.com/33o1c92.png" alt width="690" height="318"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">33o1c92.png</span><span class="informations">774×357</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>If you’re using your own web host or XAMPP you can get it by going to <a href="http://localhost/phpmyadmin" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://localhost/phpmyadmin</a> Now, you may be presented with a log-in screen, by default the username is ‘root’ and the password is ‘password’. In some cases, there is no password. After you have logged in to phpmyadmin you will be presented with a screen similar to the one below.</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i43.tinypic.com/5oibut.png" title="5oibut.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i43.tinypic.com/5oibut.png" alt width="690" height="388"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">5oibut.png</span><span class="informations">1600×900</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>Now you’ll need to create a new database called, ‘prices’. Follow the picture instructions below to see how (Its pretty simple):<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i41.tinypic.com/206oqye.png" title="206oqye.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i41.tinypic.com/206oqye.png" alt width="690" height="385"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">206oqye.png</span><span class="informations">1424×795</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>Now after you’ve created the database you’re going to want to create a new table called, ‘items’ with 4 fields. Have the following fields/rows set-up like this: (Also follow on-image instructions; you need to scroll right and make ‘id’ Auto_Increment/A_I and the Index, ‘PRIMARY’)</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i40.tinypic.com/w0s21f.png" title="w0s21f.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i40.tinypic.com/w0s21f.png" alt width="690" height="417"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">w0s21f.png</span><span class="informations">1052×636</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>After having this all filled in, click on ‘Save’ and you’re done with creating columns,<br>
MySQL holds the Databases, The databases hold the tables,<br>
When you have tables, you have columns and rows, the columns tell the username, price, email, ip address, and other fields, the rows are the data that has been inputted. Now that we have created some columns, lets get started with the User Interface that users will use to input information and view already inputted information.</p>
<p>IV. Graphical User Interface and Php Program Functions<br>
The users aren’t going to be able to put in any information without being able to have a form to enter data into, you’re now going to be needing to upload some files to your website host or wherever your website is hosted from, i would recommend creating a new directory on your website’s root index called, ‘prices’ and then uploading these files to them, below i’m going to be going over the files and what each of them do.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>index.php<br>
This is the main page that will be displayed to users, .php is a file extension telling the web browser that its an php file, so that it can read it correctly. This page will have the actual price guide on it, for everyone to see (with the optional form to have the form below it)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>insert.php<br>
This file is for the actual form that’s going to be inputting the information into the MySQL database and saving it there (After going through insert_ac.php)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>insert_ac.php<br>
This file has the information that allows the web browser to connect to the database, if it has the correct information to do so, this is also the page that will give a success page if everything goes well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, there is some data in the files that you will need to change, i’m going to post the code as whole below and then go over what sections do what, and what sections you need to change.</p>
<p>index.php</p>
<p>[code]&lt;?php<br>
$connect = mysql_connect(“localhost”, “DATABASE_USERNAME”, “DATABASE_PASSWORD”) or<br>
die (“There is an error connecting to the MySQL server”);<br>
mysql_select_db(“items”);<br>
$quey1=“select * from items”;<br>
$result=mysql_query($quey1) or die(mysql_error());<br>
?&gt;</p>

<p><b>Note: This price guide is completely made up from users, what you put in will benefit the community, everything is in the form of (m) or (Million) not (billion) if something is more than 999m, please make sure you put 1000m and not 1b. 1.4b would be 1400m and so on. Ip Addresses are logged for security reasons, and we can backtrack ip addresses.

Instructions: Enter the Item ID and the price in the field underneath the list, the ID can be found to the left of the name.&gt;</b>
</p><table>
<tr>
<th>Item Number</th>
<th>Item Name</th>
<th>Price</th>
</tr>
&lt;?php
while($row=mysql_fetch_array($result)){
$a = array($row['p1'], $row['p2']);
$division = array_sum($a) / 2;
$num=mysql_numrows($result);
echo "<td>";
echo $row['id'];
echo "</td>
<td>";
echo $row['name'];
echo "</td>
<td>";
echo "$divisionm";
echo "</td>";
}
echo "</table>";
echo "";
?&gt;
[/code]
<p>There is the top row that you are going to need to change, you are going to need to change this line of code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$connect = mysql_connect("localhost", "DATABASE_USERNAME", "DATABASE_PASSWORD") or </code></pre>
<p>Usually, “localhost” stays the same unless your database is hosted somewhere other than your own server or webhost, sometimes it can be an ip address such as, “123.45.67.89” In that case you’d change “localhost” to “123.45.67.89”. Secondly, you need to change “DATABASE_USERNAME” to your own database username, which generally is “root” and you also need to change “DATABASE_PASSWORD” to your database password, once again, generally is “password” or “root” (In rare cases).</p>
<p>Now that you’ve gotten index.php done, lets do insert.php … There isn’t any editing that needs to be done, it just needs to be saved in the same directory as index.php and insert_ac.php</p>
<p>insert.php</p>
<p>[code]</p><table>
<tr>
<td>
<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Update a Price</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Id</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Price</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
</tr>
</table>

</td>
</tr>
</table>[/code]
<p>Now for the final file, called insert_ac.php, once again there is some more information that you need to change for this file, pretty much the same information as index.php</p>
<p>insert_ac.php</p>
<p>[code]&lt;?php</p>
<p>$host=“localhost”; // Host name<br>
$username=“DATABASE_USERNAME”; // Mysql username<br>
$password=“DATABASE_PASSWORD”; // Mysql password<br>
$db_name=“DATABASE_NAME”; // Database name<br>
$tbl_name=“items”; // Table name</p>
<p>// Connect to server and select database.<br>
mysql_connect("$host", “$username”, “$password”)or die(“cannot connect”);<br>
mysql_select_db("$db_name")or die(“cannot select DB”);</p>
<p>// Get values from form<br>
$id=$_POST[‘id’];<br>
$name=$_POST[‘name’];<br>
$p1=$_POST[‘p1’];<br>
$p2=$_POST[‘p2’];</p>
<p>// Insert data into mysql<br>
$sql=“UPDATE $tbl_name SET p1 = ‘$p1’ WHERE id = ‘$id’”;<br>
$result=mysql_query($sql);</p>
<p>// if successfully insert data into database, displays message “Successful”.<br>
if($result){<br>
echo “Successful”;<br>
echo “<br>”;<br>
echo “Refresh the page to see changes”;<br>
}</p>
<p>else {<br>
echo “ERROR”;<br>
}</p>
<p>// close connection<br>
mysql_close();<br>
?&gt;[/code]</p>
<p>Now you’ll need to change these three lines:</p>
<p><code>$username="DATABASE_USERNAME"; // Mysql username 
$password="DATABASE_PASSWORD"; // Mysql password 
$db_name="DATABASE_NAME"; // Database name </code></p>
<p>It should all be the same as what you entered in the index.php, and if it isn’t, you’re doing it wrong. The database name should be “Prices” and the Table Name should stay as “items”… After you have changed the information in the 2 files and have the 3 of them saved correctly, all in the same directory, you’re ready to move on to the next step, what really is just going to <a href="http://localhost/prices" rel="nofollow noopener">http://localhost/prices</a><br>
or <a href="http://yourwebhost.com/prices" rel="nofollow noopener">http://yourwebhost.com/prices</a> to view your automatic price guide. However, you wont see any information being displayed, you can easily input more items and starter prices to the database / price guide by going into your MySQL through Phpmyadmin and going to the database and then to the ‘Items’ table, while you’re there, click ‘SQL’ at the top of the page, Sometimes it says ‘Query’ Instead of ‘SQL’. You’ll be presented with a window like this:<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i42.tinypic.com/5nrllz.png" title="5nrllz.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i42.tinypic.com/5nrllz.png" alt width="690" height="269"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">5nrllz.png</span><span class="informations">1199×468</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>In the text box simply put in the following code and press ‘Go’ to add the item and its start value to the database</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">INSERT INTO `rprices`.`items` (`id`, `name`, `p1`, `p2`) VALUES (NULL, 'Item', '', '');</code></pre>

<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this tutorial, there is a lot more that i’m going to be adding in the future, i’ll go over it in my checklist below.</p>
<p>VII. Common Errors and Questions<br>
More Errors and Questions will be added as people have different problems, i’m going to go over the programmed error messages though below.</p>
<p>Error Message:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">There is an error connecting to the MySQL server</code></pre>
<p>Meaning: This Error message is broadcasted to the Viewer when the page is loading and the Browser cannot connect to the MySQL Server, meaning you have connection information wrong somewhere, i would advise you to go over this line of code located in index.php:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$connect = mysql_connect("localhost", "DATABASE_USERNAME", "DATABASE_PASSWORD") or</code></pre>
<p>Error Message: <code>cannot connect</code><br>
Meaning: This means that the Web browser cannot connect to the MySQL database, this happens when trying to input new information in the table, after you click, ‘Submit’. To fix this, you’ll need to re-check these three lines in insert_ac.php</p>
<p><code>$host="localhost";
$username="DATABASE_USERNAME"; 
$password="DATABASE_PASSWORD"; </code></p>
<p>Error Message: <code>cannot select DB</code><br>
Meaning: This happens when you click the ‘Submit’ and the Web Browser tried to connect to the MySQL and succeeds, but then it cannot connect to the database, or the table with-in the database, this usually happens because you type the Database name or Table Name wrong in the code, or they have not been created. Revise these two lines in insert_ac.php</p>
<p><code>
