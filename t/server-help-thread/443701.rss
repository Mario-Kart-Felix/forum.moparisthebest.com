    <description>Well this thread will have any basic questions asked here. Before posting you should read this and day by day hopefully I will be adding new questions and answers here categorized. Well this is just the opening of the thread. I will be updating daily. So here are some already :P.


Q: Why doesn&#39;t my compiler work? 
A: Ok if you haven&#39;t already downloaded JDK, you will need that. When you download it, it will tell you the version, replace your compilers version to yours. If it still doesn&#39;t work, after &quot;Program Files&quot; try putting &quot;Program Files (x86)&quot; if it works that means your computer is a 32 bit.

Q: How do I make shops? 
A: [Delta] go to the config folder and open up the file named &quot;shops.cfg&quot;
And it should look something like this -
shop # @red@durr_shop 2 2 item amount item amount

[PI] same thing, open up shops.cfg, and yea.

Will be updating soon, going to grab a bite to eat.</description>
