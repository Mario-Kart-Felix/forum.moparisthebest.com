    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-connecting-to-my-server/163318</link>
    <description>Well I have a problem with getting on my server. When I run it no one including myself can connect but then I close that and run another server and people can connect to that.

The server I am trying to get on is telescape

Any help people?  :D</description>
