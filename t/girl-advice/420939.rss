    <title>Girl Advice</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/girl-advice/420939</link>
    <description>Well i thought about asking this.. Then i thought.. O_o why would i ask Girl advice from people on an online forum where half the people have never talked to girls. Anyway hopefully i can get some help.

Got this girl who i&#39;ve liked since like fucking 6th grade. She finally started to like me and she said she doesn&#39;t want a relationship with anyone right now.. She says next year she will. We&#39;ve been fighting a lot this past month and shes just been acting not as nice as she used to be. I don&#39;t think i should even like her anymore. I still do though. She&#39;s been starting all the fights and she knows she has shes even told me she has. But i mean.. What should i do.. I feel like im losing her even though i dont have her yet. We&#39;re really close, and we know everything about eachother. Don&#39;t know what to do. Any help?

Thanks in Advance.. O_o</description>

<p>You’re getting too worried about the end outcome. By what you’ve told me, i can easily see that you’re trying to ‘secure’ this girl. This is what is pushing her away.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">What are you doing wrong? </span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You probably keep hinting on something solid. Titles. Relationships. There’s nothing more scary than the, “what are we question”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’re caring too much. She’s causing fights because she’s frustrated that you’re letting her walk all over her. I bet you’re chickening out and running back to her. Copping her disrespect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’re not seeing that she’s just a girl.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">So what’s the solution to this problem?</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Relax. Enjoy what you have right now. You’re young and chances are it will only last a small while anyway. Don’t even pull the “she’s the one” card on me. It’s bullshit that helps sell romantic comedy movies. Stop bringing up relationships. Relax. Talk to other girls too. You’re not exclusive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stop letting her walk all over you. She wants a man who can turn their back to her. What do you do if she disrespects you? The silent treatment. Females hate being ignored. Triggers a fear of loss and panic. Send back 'k’s if she’s fighting about nothing. Ignore texts if they are abusive. If she’s yelling at you for bullshit, turn around and walk away. Don’t talk to her for a few days. Have the self control to not need her. Her attitude will change fast. Just don’t overdo it. If she’s arguing about something important, try connect with her emotionally instead of fighting back. Tell her you get where she’s coming from, then leave it. You can’t win fights with girls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She’s just a girl. Walk the city streets and there’s thousands of much better ones. Believe in abundance. Truly believe. Girls all shit, fart and burp. This one isn’t special in the slightest. Talk to other girls. Explore other’s personalities. Enjoy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope i’ve helped. Let me know how it goes.[/quote]<br>

Once you spend a lot of time with people sometimes that can cause problems as well. There is like 3 girls that I would consider sisters to me, I wouldn’t ever want to go out with them or anything like that, But I would help them with there problems if any pop up.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Meeper98, post:1, topic:420939”]Well i thought about asking this… Then i thought… O_o why would i ask Girl advice from people on an online forum where half the people have never talked to girls. Anyway hopefully i can get some help.</p>
<p>Got this girl who i’ve liked since like fucking 6th grade. She finally started to like me and she said she doesn’t want a relationship with anyone right now… She says next year she will. We’ve been fighting a lot this past month and shes just been acting not as nice as she used to be. I don’t think i should even like her anymore. I still do though. She’s been starting all the fights and she knows she has shes even told me she has. But i mean… What should i do… I feel like im losing her even though i dont have her yet. We’re really close, and we know everything about eachother. Don’t know what to do. Any help?</p>
<p>Thanks in Advance… O_o[/quote]</p>
<p>You’re getting too worried about the end outcome. By what you’ve told me, i can easily see that you’re trying to ‘secure’ this girl. This is what is pushing her away.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">What are you doing wrong? </span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You probably keep hinting on something solid. Titles. Relationships. There’s nothing more scary than the, “what are we question”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’re caring too much. She’s causing fights because she’s frustrated that you’re letting her walk all over her. I bet you’re chickening out and running back to her. Copping her disrespect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’re not seeing that she’s just a girl.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">So what’s the solution to this problem?</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Relax. Enjoy what you have right now. You’re young and chances are it will only last a small while anyway. Don’t even pull the “she’s the one” card on me. It’s bullshit that helps sell romantic comedy movies. Stop bringing up relationships. Relax. Talk to other girls too. You’re not exclusive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stop letting her walk all over you. She wants a man who can turn their back to her. What do you do if she disrespects you? The silent treatment. Females hate being ignored. Triggers a fear of loss and panic. Send back 'k’s if she’s fighting about nothing. Ignore texts if they are abusive. If she’s yelling at you for bullshit, turn around and walk away. Don’t talk to her for a few days. Have the self control to not need her. Her attitude will change fast. Just don’t overdo it. If she’s arguing about something important, try connect with her emotionally instead of fighting back. Tell her you get where she’s coming from, then leave it. You can’t win fights with girls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She’s just a girl. Walk the city streets and there’s thousands of much better ones. Believe in abundance. Truly believe. Girls all shit, fart and burp. This one isn’t special in the slightest. Talk to other girls. Explore other’s personalities. Enjoy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope i’ve helped. Let me know how it goes.</p>

<p>There are people who change in middle school, and people who change in highschool. And ofc those who don’t really change at all. Those who change in 8th and 9th grade are the worst, I’ve watched a lot of innocent, smart people with a lot potential end up in some deep holes. Try to bring her back as much as you can, or you’ll barely know her by next year.</p>
