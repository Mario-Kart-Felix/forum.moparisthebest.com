    <description>yes yes don&#39;t get your knickers in a twist nothing bad. lol :P

Pretty much this girl I have been seeing for like the past two months has started to tell me that she loves me. To be frank, I don&#39;t think I have the same feelings. I do still want to go out with her and have a relationship with her etc. I..just don&#39;t know if it&#39;s love yet. If that makes sense? 

What should I say? I don&#39;t want to offend her but at the same time I don&#39;t want to enrage her.</description>

Define bad for the OP. You can’t define whats good or bad unless you know what is defined as a good outcome and a bad outcome. The outcomes are subject to opinions, if a female is jealous and you and someone else broke up they would most probably say the outcome is good where as you would say its bad.<br>
My own advice has just as much value as others and it is purely up to the OP to use it. Its advice s’post to help, not advice s’post to be read, analysed and then feedback given to myself.</p>

              <p>I can see where you’re coming from L&amp;P. I’ve just recently gotten over a four year relationship. However, about 3-ish months later, here I am with a new girlfriend. I think it’s just a struggle in trying to get used to a new girl in your life. It is quite a change going from loving one girl to nothing then back to building back those kind of feelings for someone else. So, while I don’t think you’re wrong for not loving the girl back, you definitely do have feelings for her and you need to help her understand that much. You can ask her what she meant by “she loves you”. Does it necessarily mean “she’s IN love” or she “loves” you?</p>

Long story short I had went out with this girl who I DID love like everything…and if I am honest I still do so much it isn’t even funny. Anyway, when Myth-Scape went under cause of meeper she found out I couldn’t support myself/ lost the mortgage/ etc and she pretty much just dumped me :s we had gone out for over two years by that point.</p>
<p>Hell for that matter I was already somewhat considering marriage and we had talked about maybe living with each other etc but it just never happened at that point.</p>

Only tell her negative emotions if they affect the relationship i.e. if she is annoying you. i.e. Compliment her, tell her she is annoying but say something funny so she doesn’t get mad.<br>
I have a lot of superficial conversations and they work out just fine with people my age, the older people are generally speaking the more they realise the obvious tactics used haha (saying this cause I learned your 24, so their wont be as many silly females).<br>
And before you think superficial conversations are bad their not, you know good conversation topics so obviously you can use em on multiple people and it doesn’t mean you have superficial emotions.[/quote]</p>
