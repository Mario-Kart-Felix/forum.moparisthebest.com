    <title>I can&#39;t attack players for 15 minutes! when someone new starts!</title>

    <description>Well I&#39;ve got a PK Eco server, and see you start with a few barrows and 25m cash. It will be a good pk eco if i can make a timer to do this:

Not allow anything to be dropped, traded, nor to allow them to enter wildy for 15 minutes.

I&#39;ve seen a server in cases where new players must wait 15 minutes to enter wilderness (so they cannt kill accs for cash) and it teles them straight out of wildy.

Edit: This is PI, InsidiaX V8 to be exact. (317 loading 474, not the 602 one.)</description>
