Ok I assume this is your first time making a server so you need to set up a no-ip and foward your port (43594) i advise you start off with a 317 if you are new to coding servers.<br>
If however you know what you are doing and you have the server set up and all but no1 can get on then you may need titan cache…<br>
You can get this by searching titan cache download on google.<br>
You need this for other ppl to connect to 508’s[/quote]<br>
