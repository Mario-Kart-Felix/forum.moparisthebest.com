    <title>Trade Bug</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trade-bug/173767</link>
    <description>When I have a player trade each other it works perfectly, but when a player trades a second time and the trade is accepted from both partys if it is your second time trading your client will disconnect, Does anyone have any solutions to this bug? Because I can fix any bug in any server, but as it turns out this is the only one I actualy really need help on, there are no &quot;disconnect = true&quot; in my trade code so if anyone has ever had that problem please PM me or post it thanks.</description>
