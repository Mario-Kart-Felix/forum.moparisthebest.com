    <description>hey,
i have a rsps with a dupe bug on trade and i don&#39;t know how to fix it.

it&#39;s goes as next for example:
player 1 trade an item to player 2
player 1 trade with player 3 and then the item shows up again in trade
they decline the trade and player has the item again and player does still have it

so people dupe here by accident and i don&#39;t know how to solve the problem.
help me please 

thank you, Freak-</description>
