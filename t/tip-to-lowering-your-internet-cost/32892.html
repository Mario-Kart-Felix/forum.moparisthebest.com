        <p>well it worked for me casue i have rogers</p>
<p>also this won’t work if you just got the internet lets say you are getting you internet from a company for a while 8+ months.</p>
<p>this is what i did phone them up and say you want to cancell it casue its very expensive they try to keep me attached to them by saying great thigs about the company just say its hard to afford that much money right now (they’ll never let you go) first time i tried they game me a offer was $5 for every month for a year (btw i was paying $20 a month for highspeed) ok the second time i phone i got a deal for half of what i pay for 8 months which i took.[/size][/size]</p>
<p>i don’t know about other companies but rogers worked for me btw it takes sometime like 10-20min</p>
<p>hey its worth it atlest you can save some money.</p>
<p>P.S: after i got that deal i got some mails of getting other cheap offers for digital tv and cable.</p>
<p>another tip is to do this there are some companies that give you like an offer for the first 6 months pay this amount and after that diffrent amount. get it for the first 6 months then cancell it them find another deal here its Bell it was offering DSL for 3 months this much price after 3 months cancell it and go back to rogers (thats what my friend did :p)</p>
<p>btw here there more companies but rogers and bell are always competing so get the best out of it btw it can work with other companies not just them two</p>
<p>also i personally thing tip 1 is better <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>if any one have better one please put it here it be help full for all of us not only we can save but we can share</p>

        <p>I guess this might work for some people, but it would mostly work for the companies that don’t have a lot of customers. For example, if you use yahoo as your ISP, I doubt they would let you have the service for cheaper.</p>
