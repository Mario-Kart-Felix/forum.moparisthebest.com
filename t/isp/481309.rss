    <description>So, my ISP is terrible (I&#39;ve complained to them multiple times) and their service has not gotten any better.

Averaging 27% packet loss, completely disconnected from the internet every 20 minutes (no exaggeration here), and speeds ranging from 5kbps-25mbps.

First packet loss test:

Second packet loss test:
http://www.dslreports.com/pingtest/4459bccb57bb/2990518?r=756
Multiple speed tests:
http://gyazo.com/e44d376c8afaa7542b571118f4abecc2.png?1359844968

^ One of the speed tests is not in the image, the website did not register it as I was disconnected (had speeds of .1mbps download, 3mbps up).

Anyway, I cannot change my ISP as Comcast is the only &quot;high speed&quot; internet provider in my area. What would you guys recommend I do? I&#39;ve shown them these tests and they have done nothing.
Also, it isn&#39;t my router or modem as I&#39;ve replaced each of them three times.

P.S. Notes over the past hour:
2:55pm: Disconnected
3:00pm: 12mbps down, 4mbps up
3:30pm: .56mbps down, 3.7mbps up
3:40pm: Disconnected</description>

<p>Nope <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> Also my gaming friends in the neighborhood say that they have these same problems, so we all reported the issues to Comcast and asked for a technician to look at the lines… They haven’t changed anything at all yet though.</p>
