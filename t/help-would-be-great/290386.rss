    <description>Alright so i&#39;ve been trying to get my potforwarding to work for the past few weeks. I&#39;ve spent a good 30+ hours messing with my modem, and my router. I finally figured it out (i think).

Basically i have an embarq 660 series modem (a whore of a router to work with) I found alot of forums and finally figured that it was best to bridge the modem to my linksys router. Once i bridged it and portforwarded i thought i&#39;d be good to go, but of course not. 3 days later, still surfing through the search button and multiple forums i am still stuck. Could someone please help me with the error i&#39;m getting or walk me through this? It would be much appreciated... Here is the error i get when trying to start my server in the EasyRSC v1.1 Control panel. 

[code][Error] Cannot assign requested address: bind
[Error] [Ljava.lang.StackTraceElement;@2b323e[/code]


In my command prompt i get this...


[code]     [java] java.net.BindException: Cannot assign requested address: bind
     [java]     at sun.nio.ch.Net.bind(Native Method)
     [java]     at sun.nio.ch.ServerSocketChannelImpl.bind(Unknown Source)

Any insight to my problem would be amazing. Thanks guys.</description>

              <p>Alright i’ll try and get back to you, thank-you for the information and prompt response :)[br][br][size=1]Posted on: July 23, 2009, 12:38:49 am[/size][hr]I’ve adjusted my ports seeing as i’m using XP and not vista, and nothing seemed to work. I tried going up and down with my ports. I never had the problem with hamachi, and if i set it to my static IP in the server.java i don’t get the error, but then people can’t connect. So let me check to make sure i have this correct.</p>
<p>I input my computers IP into the settings file, within the client which i can find from <a href="http://whatismyip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">whatismyip.com</a></p>
<p>and i input my defualt gateway 192.168.1.1 to the server.java file.</p>
<p>After that people should be able to access my server without using hamachi through portforwarding (which i believe i have done correctly after visiting and posting on numberous help sites) …</p>

              <p>The problem comes from using a port that’s in use. Are you using Vista? Because Vista doesn’t clear the port for some reason.</p>
<p>Basically try the following:<br>
a) FOR VISTA: Goto the taskmanager and kill all java process’. If the error still continues, goto B.<br>
b) Change the port your server is assigned to.</p>
