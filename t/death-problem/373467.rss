    <title>Death Problem?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/death-problem/373467</link>
    <description>Hey everyone sorry to sound like a total noob here but I&#39;m currently debugging Drowning508 and for some reason when anyone gets killed by an NPC it throws this error and the account is locked. After it initially throws the error as soon as you try to login it locks up your client and the screen goes white. The worst part about this error is that it crashes the entire server so It isn&#39;t a small thing to just forget about. I am really trying to learn the basics of 508 and i need a little bit of help on this one. Once again sorry for asking you guys to spoonfeed me but i am really stuck here. Thanks :)

Here is the error it gives me
[b]Exception in thread &quot;Thread-0&quot; java.lang.NullPointerException
          at palidino76.rs2.player.Player.dropStuff(Player.java:3637)
          at palidino76.rs2.player.Player.process(Player.java:2185)
          at palidino76.rs2.Engine.run(Engine.java:230)
          at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:619)[/b]</description>

              <p>Is that the only place i need to look or should i look in every place they list?<br>
Line 3637 in Player.java says this:<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Player pKill = Server.engine.players[killerId];</span><br>
Line 2185 in Player.java says this:<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">dropAllItems(getPlayerKiller());<br>
</span></p>
<p>I don’t see where anything is wrong with either of these. They don’t throw errors when i try to compile and I’m not even sure where i should edit to fix the problem.</p>
