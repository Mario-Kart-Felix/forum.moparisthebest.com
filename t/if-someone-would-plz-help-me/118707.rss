              <p>ok, so instead of using hamachi bc its really dumb, try taking you router ip and typeing it in you url bar (adressbar) and then it should pop up a window that looks like this:<br>
<a href="http://img.draynor.net" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img.draynor.net/uploads/ip0aa75.jpg" alt width="" height=""></a><br>
good luck i hope this helped</p>
