    <title>Who would be interested in this?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/who-would-be-interested-in-this/146549</link>
    <description>Hey, I&#39;m not sure if anyone&#39;s offered this before as I haven&#39;t been known for hanging around moparscape a lot in the past.

Would anyone be interested in a purely rs-private-server host? IE, a dedicated network of machines with a decent connection which you could host your server on, instead of hosting yourself at home. 

What would this mean for your server? High speeds and always-online without you having to look after a machine. I would also be providing a control panel to restart/make changes to your server, so that you wouldn&#39;t have to mess with command-line stuff. This service would not be free however, as it would be using servers that I&#39;m also using for other things, and I need to cover the costs. I would keep it cheap, though.

Thoughts?</description>
