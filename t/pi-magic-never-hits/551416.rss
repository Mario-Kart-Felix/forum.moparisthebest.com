    <title>[PI]Magic Never Hits</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-magic-never-hits/551416</link>
    <description>As the title says, I&#39;m using a &#39;reformed&#39; TrisidiaX client and server (317 with 525 cache).

All attacks work as far as I can tell, except for magic. It seems if you cast on something, say a rock crab, it will cast and do the animation, but never damage or even hit. No 0, no damage, no health.

I&#39;ve been digging in my combatassistant.java and even forced the finalMagicDamage(c) to have +1 so that it would always be 1 or greater. 

Still no damage.

As well, once you attack with magic, no other attacks work until you relog. Including melee and range.

This leads me to believe something else somewhere is borked. Any suggestions or ideas?</description>

              <p>Yea, let’s be fair here, the PI base is useless. I have moved from that heap of unorganized shit to the 718 client. Which is a little less of a heap of unorganized shit. Thanks for the help though. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> <span class="bbcode-s">Rep+</span> &lt;-- Not a thing anymore lol</p>

              <p>Well…</p>
<p>I’m gonna tell you this. It could be something very easy and just not obvious, or something complex but obvious. Or anything in the middle…</p>
<p>The combat on PI isn’t pretty. at all. I would say to look for either “c.usingMagic” (There will be dozens of results) or “c.hitDelay” in the combat assistant… As both of those are going to be rather related to the issue.<br>
usingMagic is a boolean that tells if… well the player is using magic.<br>
hitDelay is an int that will decide how long it takes for the damage to be applied.</p>
<p>Can we also see the “handleHitMask” and “dealDamage” methods (Should be in player or client)</p>
