    <title>Help with Norton Internet Security Portforwarding PLEASE!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-norton-internet-security-portforwarding-please/441556</link>
    <description>I have been trying to portforward for like 2 days LOL. Could someone let me know if I&#39;m missing anything as I believe I&#39;ve done quite literally everything possible Like atleast 10 times... My operating system is Windows 7.

-I have successfully portforwarded.

For some reason, the port is still blocked. I have tried doing the tutorial/answer in this thread http://community.norton.com/t5/Norton-Internet-Security-Norton/NIS-2010-Port-Forwarding/td-p/179696
But it still acts as if it is still blocked. This is really getting annoying. I would gladly appreciate someone&#39;s help. It would really make me happy :) Thanks

After every step, I checked http://www.canyouseeme.org and it always said connection refused or connection timed out.</description>

              <p>What type of router do you have maybe I can find a guide</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
It could be several things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You did not portforward right as in it may need to be portforwarded on TCP AND UDP or BOTH maybe. Also, have you tried using your ipv4 address from the command prompt?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your internet provider may not allow portforwarding through their services even though their is an option for portforwarding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have skype add me and we can sort something out</p>
</li>
</ol>

              <p>Okay so you’ve forwarded your ports.<br>
Now as ultimatepkvillage said, add the ports to your firewall.<br>
In my opinion, disable windows firewall, and get rid of crappy Norton that picks up text files as malicious content.</p>
<p>Seriously, but anyways yeah, disable windows firewall, then Norton’s firewall protection.<br>
Then try <a href="http://canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.org</a>. Good choice, I use it too to check if my ports are accepting connection.</p>
<p>EDIT: OR make an exception in Norton’s firewall and disable windows fire wall.</p>
