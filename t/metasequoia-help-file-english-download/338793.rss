    <description>[size=18pt]HELLO[/size]

[center]Hello everyone well iv been working on a project to convert the metasequoia file from japan to english i am almost done. I have been working on this project for a month. I have been translating through books and the computer. Once this is released no one will be asking for help with metasequoia again. i have read through the file and i already know how to use iit in an advanced fashion. Alot of people pmed me for this from different forums and by email also. so i finally present you with the first ever copy of the help file in english. i translated as well as i could so please do not post rude or disturbing comments. this project will be released by 3 pm EST tomorrow. so please be patient and it will be released. The file does not include pictures because the pictures are shown in japanese. I also tried my best to make the help file make sense.[/center]

The file is finally up. hope you guys enjoy it and learn alot from it. This took me a total of a month and a half to do.
