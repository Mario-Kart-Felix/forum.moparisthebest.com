    <description>Hi all!

I&#39;ve made a little scar script to find a picture on my screen. But now, much difficult for me, i need to find a little java movement. I think it&#39;s only a little movement with 4-5 pictures, but i dont know how to find this with scar. 
Can some1 help me, please?

              <p>You’re right, it’s an animated graphic. I’ll try to do what you say, to find a specified color and a moment after, to see if the color changes to the second color.</p>
<p>Thank you very much</p>

              <p>I think I understand what you’re looking for. You’re not looking for a bmp on the screen any more, you’re looking for an animated graphic? Correct me if I’m wrong.</p>
<p>Scar doesn’t work with animations, it works with colors and bitmaps only. To get around this problem, you will need to write a simple procedure/function to somehow detect this animation. Usually in a game like runescape, you would write a function that will look for a specific color (a color that is prominent in your desired animation). Once Scar finds this color, you then get it to move the mouse over it, and if the text in the top left corner confirms that it’s your object, then you’ve found your object. Otherwise the function repeats.</p>
<p>If what you’re working with is outside of runescape and the above method won’t work for it, you have to be creative and try different things. For instance, you can find a particular pixel, and then wait for it to change color. If the color it changes to corresponds to your desired animation, then you’ve found your desired animation. Otherwise, repeat the function/procedure until you’ve found it.</p>
<p>If you can provide a link to the animation you’re talking about, then maybe other members can suggest what they think would be the best algorithm to find your animation.</p>

<p>Ok, first of all, I’m sorry if i cant express what i want to explain, i’m not English and it’s difficult for me.<br>
So, I need to find something as an animated gif, for example, but really it is a program made in java, so i supose the little thing i have to find is made in java. I only need to click in with the mouse. It is very easy. I fact, the scar script is made (but looking for a little picture) but now i have change this picture for an “animated picture”.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
