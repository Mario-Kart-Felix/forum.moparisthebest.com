    <title>Hydro Servers webhosting/website for your server, Server website along with team</title>

    <description>Our team, Herbal Tea Coding, has just went public with Hydro Servers(hydroservers.com).
We are working on, and dedicated to, our server. The server at this point is nameless, but is very much playable at this point, we are just striving as a team to bring you the best server we can by adding more and more, and by tweaking every little thing. Because of our dedication to making the server fun so it can have many players and a great community, it wont be up and playable for months to come.

However this post isn&#39;t about our current server project.(--details currently unavailable--)
Its our website project(Hydro Servers) we&#39;re here to talk about.

Instead of making our website with the name of our server, we made a &quot;Servers&quot; site, meaning &quot;Hydro Servers&quot; can be the webhost and somewhat of a main website for your server and updates and news. Actually a few servers! Basically what we are thinking we are going to do is review different peoples servers and pick the best 2 or 3 servers, and those servers can be featured on &quot;Hydro Servers&quot;. Of course you&#39;ll have to send us your server information in the comments and leave your email along with a little information, or you can send us all of the appropriate information by email. And we will review the servers from there and contact the owners of the servers by email when we choose.

[b]The Email is at the end of the post.[/b]

[size=14pt][b]-How it works[/b][/size]
The website is http://hydroservers.com/
Where it says &quot;server 1&quot; &quot;server 2&quot; &quot;server 3&quot; on the server list page is where your custom designed logo for your server will be placed and that will take the person to your webclient or start downloading your downloadable client.
Any news you have about your server, or reasons for it being down, can be sent to our email and we will post it on our homepage as a news bulletin titled &quot;Your Servers Name - Recent News&quot; for an example.
Basically we are saving you the hassle of making your own site, buying your own domain and setting everything up, which can be a lot to handle for one person a long with running a server. That&#39;s why the Herbal Tea Coding team is here for those who truly have worthy servers.
And these servers don&#39;t need to have a huge player base or be worked on for years, we are judging on everything. We review your post as a team and pick the servers we think could truly get popular and have a bigger fan base than what they already do. Heck you may even be just releasing your server, doesn&#39;t matter, if you think your server is good enough send us pictures and give us information.

[size=10pt][b]FYI[/b][/size]
-We are a small team, With only a Graphic Designer, Coder/Hoster, Website Manager.(All fluent in javascript)

-We are currently looking for a coder or two and a graphic designer. You can apply by email.(Email is at the end of the post)

-We are coding and testing our current server and will be for a while, and dont plan on hosting until we have enough money to purchase the right computer and router for our hoster to properly run a smooth running server with no problems.


[size=14pt]Summary[/size]
To sum it all up, 
-Our website is basically acting as a website for your server, but another server or two at the same time.
-You&#39;ll have the support of a small team.
-Help advertising
-It&#39;ll all look neat and professional.

Hope we summed it up good for you and you all have a good idea of what we are offering.

              <p>-Money<br>
-Our Web Designer/Manager is at work currently making a site in Adobe Dreamworks.<br>
-Thank you for moving the post to its correct place.<br>
-Other people seem to think we were clear enough.</p>
<p>If you have the gist, contact us, we will fill you in on the offer, and make things as clear as possible.</p>
<p>We are offering a site to people with servers that want to build an audience and get more players, and somewhat join a team.<br>
We will run the site, and help you with your server along the way as much as we can.</p>
<p>Example: moobscape has a website “<a href="http://moobscape.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moobscape.com</a>”, the website will tell you all the server news and updates,<br>
joobscape toobscape and froobscape all have one site, “<a href="http://HydroServers.com" rel="nofollow noopener">HydroServers.com</a>”. And we will run and pay for the domain name and website.</p>
<p>People seem to be getting caught up on the “webs” aspect of the whole thing but we just started and webs had some great offers and features. Also, something a lot of people don’t know about webs, is that it can be switched to a HTML/file host. Therefore once our other website is designed we can switch off the webs designed site and run our own without ever leaving webs.</p>
<p>We really don’t know whats in store for us so please don’t focus only on the webs aspect.</p>
<p>Thank you<br>
