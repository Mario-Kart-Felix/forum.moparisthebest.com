    <description>With the rewrite of Hybridscape I want the majority of the content to be scripted rather the 1 million classes. The question becomes what should be scripted and what shouldn&#39;t.  

Packet System - The packet system should be easily changeable and extendable without mass fucking the content. I read in moparscape about the json idea and think that may be a decent approach. However I have not come with a good idea on how to handle the fact that packets change parameters for outgoing packets from big version jumps of the game.

The only idea I could come up with was to have a interface for outgoing packets and all the methods use the varargs approach

for example a method like writeInterfaceText(Object... params)



This topic will be expanded as I finish each part I am working on.</description>
