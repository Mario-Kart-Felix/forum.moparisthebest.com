so we have a coder only 1 atm but we could use and our fourms arnt the best since i did it my self we will make it better
What makes this server so unique?
We need a webdevloper, and a good coder. We spent so much time on coding the server/forums, so that you, the players, can enjoy both forums and the server. We also listen to our players, and we treat them like they are family.We still could use more help the more the better the server

What does this server have:
We are brand spanking new, so there will be a few bugs.
We have 90% working castle wars(Need to fix the spawn when you die in the minigame)
Our donator zone is unique in it&#39;s own way!
We also have bossing, and perfect switching!
Economy is very stable, and it&#39;s not that hard to earn money!
Working dung!
Working SoF
Torva
Pernix
Virtus
Primal
Tons of NPCs to kill!
Full working Pest Control!
120 on all skills!(CB level of 168)
Full working Jad!
More minigames!
Fight bosses, and earn big rewards!
100% working Summoning!
ALOT MORE!
We will host events every now and then, and keep adding in updates to the server to make it more enjoyable for you!

Future updates for the server:
Changing the revision from: 317 loading 642 to 317 loading 718.
Adding highscores
A new forums(will be about 3 months before this happens)
A custom minigame
Stealing creations 100% working(be about a month)
more custom
A few custom bosses
Ability to restore spec(for extreme donors)


Updates that happened since the server has been up:

Fixed the castle wars bug.
Fixed the dueling bug(when you win, you are stuck at duel. Now fixed)
Added a herb shop that sells overloads (900k/ovl)
Added a herb shop that is for 70+ herb
A few new fun but useless commands has been added
Added to when you get 99 or 120 in a skill, you can click that skill in the stats and then a menu will pop up to change emblem, and it will be that skills symbol by your name!



Please, take the time and visit us, we promise you that you will love the server!
