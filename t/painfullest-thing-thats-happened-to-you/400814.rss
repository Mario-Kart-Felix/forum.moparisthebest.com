Not having novicaine when getting 4 teeth pulled…<br>

Omg that happened to you too? I got 4 out when I was 16 and the doctor said he gave me enough shots and then next one would put me under cause they had to cut open my gums some cause the root was too long to be pulled out directly. I couldn’t sleep for weeks after that.</p>
<p>Mine: I choked on a chip, fell forward slammed my head on the counter and tried to grab something, grabbed the cord to our new STEEL toaster oven (thing was like 40 pounds) and fell back pulling it and making it fall on my balls. Then I threw up because of the pain and had to sit there for 2 hours till someone got home.[/quote]<br>
OUCH</p>

Broke my arm by jumping on the trampoline in the middle of the winter. Went to get off, and it didn’t exactly go the way I planned. Ended up slipping on ice. I was like 8, and yes, I started crying. Most people would have if you were put into that situation at that age.<br>
