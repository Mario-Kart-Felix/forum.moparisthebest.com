    <title>Help restarting my coding process</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-restarting-my-coding-process/506565</link>
    <description>Ive spent a lot of time coding a server that was never online before on my old computer just trying to learn to code cause I always wished I could learn to design my own game that I been thinking of ideas for.(rsps&#39;s was probley not the right type of coding to learn for that and im probley way off on what I need to learn) but never the less im a lot older know and just got new computer and I wanted to try and learn to code again. my biggest problem is I don&#39;t even got a source and client base yet cause im scared to download on this new computer. is the ways to know if something I download has viruses? and I tried to research making a rsps from scratch without downloading a base but I couldn&#39;t find anything.

my main questions I can think of atm...

1.) What are few ways to determain if something is safe to download or not?
2.) is there a way to basically get only the map and graphics and weapons from rsps and create something completely different?
3.) If I did whats refered to in Q2, would it even be any more safe then downloading a base? (say delta or PI for instance)
4.) I liked coding the source last time I did it and really want to do again, but is rsps just a complete bad idea on a new computer anyways..?

P.s.: Any other random info you wanna give me that relates n any way to what this is about feel free. Also anyone that knows a lot about coding and whats to help me out once I get the source and client to start with let me know. (:

Thx.

              <p>thx m8 that’s the one I wanted to use anyways cause the designer looks to of went into a lot of detail on the small things since I normaly don’t see working cannons and perfect farming on older rsps’s and clue scrolls look well done… and well basically everything. well if I need anything else can I pm you or something?</p>
<p>-----------EDIT----------------<br>

Number 2 would be better. as it was made for 06. the first one was a pk server with high revision content added.</p>

<li>Normally read the comments. Most threads get locked if a virus is proven to be found in the source, comments can always help.</li>
<li>Uh, from what I’m reading here, you just want the cache data (that has all the maps, weapons, etc in it).</li>
<li>You’d want to get a client with the cache at the minimal, because you need something to interpret the data in the cache, and hey, there’s a client pre-built for you that does such. as for safe wise, read my answer to 1.</li>
<li>I don’t see how it could be a bad idea. Just get an IDE, and set up your java classpaths.</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s plenty of people that can point you in the right direction with your source. Depending on what you have, take a look here:<br>
<a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,598683.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Team J-Program thread</a><br>
Also, this is the help section (for server sided issues) so feel free to ask questions for it.<br>
Just don’t get a client issue confused with a server issue.</p>
