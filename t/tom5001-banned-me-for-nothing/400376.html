        <p>Spawn camping/killing is against the rules, most people who play the server frequently know this. It isn’t on the rules list, but neither are a few other rules, hopefully that’ll be changed soon though.</p>

<p>Quiet down newfag. What’s the point in killing the same person over and over if they don’t have items anyway? It’s been a rule, and when a mod tells you it’s against the rules, it’s against the rules. Plus, an admin/mod may bend the rules to fit any given scenario. It’s called the elastic clause.</p>

<p>Get off his dick kid. There was no real reason to ban me. If it was against the rules, I still STOPPED WHEN HE TOLD ME. “elastic clause” doesn’t mean he can bend the rules to ban a player he doesn’t like.</p>

No, it means he can bend the rules to where an issue has come up that doesn’t have a specific region of set rule against it. Plus, I’m more likely to trust someone I know then someone I’ve never met, and I’m not ‘on his dick’, you’re just an immature little 12 year old who doesn’t know how to control his anger.

First off I’m not a little 12 year old, I’m 17. Second off, you’re completely ignoring the main logic of my argument. How can you enforce a rule that isn’t even on the list? He’s not bending rules, he’s pulling them out of his ass to ban someone for no reason. You’re too afraid to stand up against him, but I’m not.</p>
<p>Also another thing to note is that he didn’t ban me immediately. I took it as a warning to not kill him again,(which was still bull) but i did stop. It wasn’t until I started calling him out about how he bans people for nothing and has an ego. THEN I was banned.</p>
<p>So we can see here that he was using this imaginary rule as an excuse to ban, on a player who’s not afraid to stand up against his little “mod powers”.</p>

<p>Now now, nobody likes a lier.</p>
<p>You killed me a good 5/6 times before you left, and another few times outside. You then start telling me I’m wrong, and that I made it up. I’m sure the other moderator who was on can confirm this.</p>
<p>I’m also not angry at you, because you wasted the trip here. I don’t carry items on me, so why would I be angry? And besides the entire point, nobody likes a ban evader with multiple accounts either!</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes but when you told me it was against the rules, even though i disagreed, i still left. I did kill you 5-6 times before that though. And i didn’t kill you outside after that, after THAT I went into another building.</p>
<p>And you were probably angry because I called you out on your egotistical ways. And ban evading?</p>
<p>And besides all this, my first time breaking a rule, and automatic ban? I also checked the rules, what you said were rules WEREN’T on the list.</p>
<p>Now tell me. HOW IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT ON THE RULES LIST ENFORCEABLE?</p>
<p>EVEN SO, HOW DOES IT RESULT IN A DIRECT BAN???</p>
<p>A rule isn’t on the list<br>
A player breaks the imaginary rule<br>
The arrogant Mod is trigger happy(for banning)<br>
He bans the player</p>
<p>I fail to see the logic in this…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Quiet down newfag. What’s the point in killing the same person over and over if they don’t have items anyway? It’s been a rule, and when a mod tells you it’s against the rules, it’s against the rules. Plus, an admin/mod may bend the rules to fit any given scenario. It’s called the elastic clause.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Get off his dick kid. There was no real reason to ban me. If it was against the rules, I still STOPPED WHEN HE TOLD ME. “elastic clause” doesn’t mean he can bend the rules to ban a player he doesn’t like.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No, it means he can bend the rules to where an issue has come up that doesn’t have a specific region of set rule against it. Plus, I’m more likely to trust someone I know then someone I’ve never met, and I’m not ‘on his dick’, you’re just an immature little 12 year old who doesn’t know how to control his anger. Chill out.<br>
[/quote]<br>
First off I’m not a little 12 year old, I’m 17. Second off, you’re completely ignoring the main logic of my argument. How can you enforce a rule that isn’t even on the list? He’s not bending rules, he’s pulling them out of his ass to ban someone for no reason. You’re too afraid to stand up against him, but I’m not.</p>
<p>Also another thing to note is that he didn’t ban me immediately. I took it as a warning to not kill him again,(which was still bull) but i did stop. It wasn’t until I started calling him out about how he bans people for nothing and has an ego. THEN I was banned.</p>
<p>So we can see here that he was using this imaginary rule as an excuse to ban, on a player who’s not afraid to stand up against his little “mod powers”.[/quote]<br>
Ok, so it’s not on the list. However, it says no pvp in spawn city. Your house, town, city, whatever it may be, is your spawn. Also, what did u get out of repeatedly killing someone with no items?</p>
