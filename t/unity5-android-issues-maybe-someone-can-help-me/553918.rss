So when I test on my unity remote from my android device it looks like this:

but when I build and run it on my phone it comes out like this for some reason:

im wondering why the terrain gets darker and sprites smaller and black.</description>

              <p>i agree as it does make sense. i bought an ios license as well today it’s only logical to be on both platforms.<br>
The ios app store i feel has very strict app guide lines once i got into the application requirements to get an app approved. android is much easier but it allows many useless applications.</p>
<p>i still perfer android over ios but my developer was complaining about needing both platforms, one problem arose though it’s a pain to build ios on a windows operating system keep that in mind guys if you ue windows.</p>
<p>Just a bit of advice if you need to test on different devices amazon web services has a new product that lets you test it in the cloud. it’s decent pricing at aws unless you need support then your wallet will hurt haha.</p>

<p>yes both android marketplace and ios app store both cost cash to publish apps even free ones though it’s free to export from unity.  I noticed many unity assets are free now like the android native plugin that simplifies development using google play services like high scores and such so you don’t have to hand code everything.</p>

<p>Which makes sense, due to the mobile games market being so saturated.<br>
When majority of applications don’t turn out a profit, taking a percentage cut after x amount wouldn’t make sense.</p>

<p>I checked out unity 5 for my android game. so in my case i was unable to create it with the budget i had using unity so i am using a cheaper approach considering my budget is currently 2500$. apparently unitys screen sizes have to be able to stretch on mobile devices and you should configure it to fit to the different screen sizes using unity assets to make it easier. we where going to use android native but i took the chance and am going with a converter once the game is created using development software at adobe. You need to remember to publish to the android store you need to pay a 25$ fee at google developer console. i paid for the developer license a few days ago i would stick with android because IOS Cost 99$ Per Year so unless you counted on admob or iap it would not be worth it with a small budget using unitys xcode also requires on windows to use a mac computer or converter if possible i’m not completely sure how it all works out on ios. i wish you the best of luck with your game development it looks great but i would use the current project you have and make it into your own game free of copyrights so its not a low end version of runescape. you have potential if you want you can add me on skype if you want to collaborate with ideas i am not looking to do anything aside from brain storm with you though in my case i already have the general idea and place to start developing the rest mine isn’t as complex as its more story and choices make the game unique. anyways add catokraken on skype if you want. if not i still think you should continue working it could be interesting given enough time and effort. </p>

<p>They still charge for mobile development? Even after it went free?</p>
