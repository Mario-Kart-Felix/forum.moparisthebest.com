[/quote]Actually, adding the pathfinding routine wouldn‚Äôt be very hard, as it is pretty short in the client. I would just have to have the map files dumped server-sided, which someone has already done for clipped npc movement.</p>
<p>As for buffer overflows, being the lazy half-assed person I am, I just increased the buffer size to allow updating 255 other players at once.

In Java, a byte is unsigned and could just have a cast used return the proper value, but not in C#. I forgot about this so walking took a little longer than expected.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Oh, and if you read this Moparisthebest, if you want I can give you the server how it is right now, which is full player updating and walking, plus the entire packet size list. However, if not I will build onto it and add NPCs and some other important stuff.</span>[/quote]Do you know what I‚Äôm referring to when I say the client-sided buffer overflows? The client reads a packet and stores it in a buffer of 5K, anything more than that will overflow it and cause the client to spit out a fatal error. For other packets, there is no risk of overflowing it, but for player updating, it is very common. Since appearance updates are around 52 bytes of size and chat updates can reach ~250 bytes (assuming you don‚Äôt cap the chat limit), the flag based update for a single player can reach about 150 bytes on average (assuming they are doing plenty of tasks - chatting, most importantly) and since there is a 255 local player limit, and assuming they are all  doing these actions at the same time (highly unlikely, but still possible), the packet size for each would be around 40K, and thus causing the client to shit bricks.</p>
<p>And yes, I understand how byte signedness works; you, however, I‚Äôm not so sure. Java bytes are signed by the way, not unsigned - as there are no unsigned data types in the language. And sure enough, if you cast an unsigned value to a signed byte type, it will assume the signed value. This is so with C# and any other language as well.</p>
<p>By the way, Moparisthebest was talking about buying your <span class="bbcode-b">client</span>, not server. Believe me, there are a few way ahead of you (me, for instance) - and besides, yours probably doesn‚Äôt event comply with the requisites.</p>

<p>And I didn‚Äôt realize his proposition included the server. My bad.[/quote]Actually, all the clients out there are modified. The ‚Äúdeobs‚Äù are modified to cancel out the modpow operation, disable updating, and load the cache from the cache folder. I don‚Äôt think changing a number will be such a big deal, since if it gets released it will be considered a deob.</p>

        <p>I believe I‚Äôve said this before, but to clarify again, the $100 is basically just for the client, I don‚Äôt care if you wrote the server or not, or how complete it is (as long logging in and walking works), I just need one because that is the only way I can verify the client actually works.</p>
