    <description>Hello everybody!
-Tired of all the hybrid pvp leaches? I sure am!
-Tired of all the laggy and poorly coded servers out there that arent worth your time?
Project PVP is a new RSPS development team that will be working on a fresh project insanity source,
We intend to make a fantastic server that our players will actually enjoy playing!
As i am sortof oldschool and dont enjoy 508-639 clients i will be using a 474 gameframe as it is less laggy and in my opinion more fun to play on
As this is a new project we are in the beta stages of creating this server
As our developer team will be complete (4-6)  people we will discuss what exactly to add into our server
These are a few things that will be 100% added::
Tormented demons (474 gameframe)
Corporal Beast (474 game frame)
Godwars dungeon (474 gameframe) -(might add new maps- will see as we progress)
Fully working castle wars
Fully working pest control (with npc&#39;s)
Fully working duel arena (zero glitches)
Fully working clan wars system
Fully working assault minigame (maybe)
Modicons specific for each developers role, and support etc icons.
Add 100% All skills
Add hp and prayer orbs which will help in pking
A bunch of simple server sided coding (i.e. Shops, drop rates, economy, etc.)
amazing donator island, with seperate super donator island
I am looking for the following information in the applications to be a developer for this project
-Time for coding each day::
-Age::
-time zone::
-Project insanity experience::
-what projects have u worked on earlier or what programming have you yourself done::
-Coder 1-10/10::
-what field are you interested in or are good at? (i.e. Client sided, server sided, graphics design, web developer:: list all the fields u are good at)::
I will start you guys out so you have an example of what to post:
1.4 hours everyday unless i have alot of school work
2.16
3.New york city time zone
4. I have worked with project insanity for a year and a half and i am very familiar with it
5.Have worked on a previous server called pk-reality, its a decent server that i worked on for 2 weeks
6.8/10
7.client/server sided and web developer

Theres your example spots currently open::
Client developer-none/pildurass/RampageDesigns
Server developer-none/pildurass/RampageDesigns
Overall programmer-none (this is pretty much an economy developer that works on shops drop rates etc.)
Lead developer-pildurass,
Lead developer 2-RampageDesigns
Web design-none
Graphics design-none


Maybe a few more bosses that we will think of later
Any suggestions for name of project+name of server are appreciated
We also will need beta testers::
SEARCHING FOR 7
1.combat evolved
2.dirtyboy
3.zerapk
4.i hybrid i
5.arrav
6.Toxicturn
7.none

Please respond with constructive criticism, once we get started will update you guys daily with whats going to be added
This is posted on google AND moparscape
Also i have already purchased a vps and php hosting so web designer positions can start work right away</description>
