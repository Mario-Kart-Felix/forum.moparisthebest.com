    <title>317 server starting problem ugh</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-server-starting-problem-ugh/358990</link>
    <description>Hey guys, Well a while back a hosted a 317 and moved so my internet was shut off for a little bit. I decided to let my server status get below 40% so it would delete and when I was able to get the server ready again i could just register it and that be it.

Well, i clicked register and put in all my info correct, i know i port forward correctly and when i i click register it said thanks for updating and sent: Null disconnected (69.65.42.216)

I thought thats what it was supposed to do every 30 minutes. Well thats the only time it does it so it keeps my server on the offline page. Any ideas?</description>
