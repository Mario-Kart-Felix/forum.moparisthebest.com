    <title>Eh.. guys, I need some help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/eh-guys-i-need-some-help/17011</link>
    <description>Okay.. Well, I&#39;ve tried on two computers, because the first one was hooked up to a router and it kept telling me that the port was already in use.
but it does it on this computer too.
I do everything, i open compile, then it says &quot;p16 by wolf enabled!&quot;
but then i open runserver and it says &quot;Error: Unable to startup listener on 43594 - port already in use?&quot;
So then i close them both out, and i open runserver first, then it goes &quot;p16 by wolf enabled!&quot;, then i open compile, and it has the port problem again..
what should i do?
its so frustrating -.-
is there like.. some other compile/run code i need to put in there? cause i put in: 

@echo off
COLOR 08
title BLAKESCAPE Client
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_06\bin\javac.exe&quot; -cp . *.java
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_06\bin\java.exe&quot; server
pause-ga-bin.jar server

for both runserver and compile...</description>

              <p>put this in your Runserver.bat file</p>
<p><code>@echo off
COLOR 08
title BLAKESCAPE Client
"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_06\bin\javac.exe" -cp . *.java
"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_06\bin\java.exe" server
pause
</code></p>
<p>then doubleclick on Runserver.bat and you should see : p16 enabled (or something)<br>
after that open up a client and log in but WITHOUT pressing on Compile.bat</p>
<p><code>"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_06\bin\javac.exe" -cp . *.java
"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_06\bin\java.exe" server</code></p>
<p>the first code means its compiling the files.<br>
the second one means its running so basically when you start Runserver.bat it compiles + it starts the server so you dont need to press on Compile.bat anymore</p>
