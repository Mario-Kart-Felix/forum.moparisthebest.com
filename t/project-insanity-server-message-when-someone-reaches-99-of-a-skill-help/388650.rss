    <title>Project Insanity server message when someone reaches 99 of a skill help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-insanity-server-message-when-someone-reaches-99-of-a-skill-help/388650</link>
    <description>Basically i am trying to add a message that broadcasts to everyone (like yell) for when someone reaches level 99 of a skill. So for example when player A reaches 99 strength everyone sees the message Server: Player A has just received 99 strength. I tried to do this awhile ago but after not being able to get it working i had to move onto more important fixes.

Heres what i currently have (not currently in my server as i removed it due to its problems), however all it does is causes the server to mess up whenever people start leveling and doesnt display the message. Initially i had it written completely different however it would just say the skill number rather than name ie Server: A has just received 99 2 (instead of Server: A has just received 99 strength)

above public void refreshSkill(int i) {

&lt;blockquote&gt;public String getSkillName(int skillId) {
    switch (skillId) {
        case 0:
            return &quot;Attack&quot;;
        case 1:
            return &quot;Defence&quot;;
        case 2:
            return &quot;Strength&quot;;
        case 3:
            return &quot;Hitpoints&quot;;
        case 4:
            return &quot;Ranged&quot;;
        case 5:
            return &quot;Prayer&quot;;
        case 6:
            return &quot;Magic&quot;;
        case 7:
            return &quot;Cooking&quot;;
        case 8:
            return &quot;Woodcutting&quot;;
        case 9:
            return &quot;Fletching&quot;;
        case 10:
            return &quot;Fishing&quot;;
        case 11:
            return &quot;Firemaking&quot;;
        case 12:
            return &quot;Crafting&quot;;
        case 13:
            return &quot;Smithing&quot;;
        case 14:
            return &quot;Mining&quot;;
        case 15:
            return &quot;Herblore&quot;;
        case 16:
            return &quot;Agility&quot;;
        case 17:
            return &quot;Theiving&quot;;
        case 18:
            return &quot;Slayer&quot;;
        case 19:
            return &quot;Runecrafting&quot;;
    
	}
	return c.playerName;
           
}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

i&#39;m not sure why i have return c.playerName there, but i know i needed something for it to work otherwise compile errors.

and in my public void levelUp(int skill) { , it obviously continues with the rest of that void but im just showing what i added to each skill =p
