    <title>How to make the client run on a webpage?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-the-client-run-on-a-webpage/334656</link>
    <description>me and my friend have been trying alot of things to get the client into our webpage. We want it to run on the webpage like runescape does, instead of a client. If someone can give me a tutorial, video, or a code that would be great... if you give me a code i need the code that i would put on the page content so that it will run like a regular client would but on a webpage.

Thnks,

Tom</description>
