    <description>Hmm.... I don&#39;t know how.. but somehow i just cant make it.. Someone know&#39;s how i can do it? I think i used dds-speced base i tought it was 377 right? or 317.. PLEASE SOME one help me!?!?!?


Okay, well i found one, tried it.. But d-claws don&#39;t work and grafix of all the pvp stuff and everything DOESN&#39;T WORK!
please some one teach me how to do it. or someone make a client it can use, my server p-scape is pretty populair but if i get gs stance&#39;s i get more ppls to stay :D, 

help me, you will be rewarded.

Sorry, java :P.

--- addd one day ater.

okay i searched for all the delta clients and i tried a few off them. But when i download them and i un-zipped them, i try to run, all works. the next step: log-in, works! the final bug.. SPAZ.. if i log in i see a name look like &quot;awe2a241d&quot; or something, verry weird. also my head is doing weird... how come? and if you found a client you think it must work with gs stances + d claws ect, please send me moparscape link. 

Thanks.
