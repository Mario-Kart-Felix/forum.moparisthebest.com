    <title>Section rules?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/section-rules/444085</link>
    <description>I believe you should add a rule that goes along the line of &#39;No nominations of staff members&#39; etc.

Just my two cents, as I&#39;m sure someone is going to post something of the sort!

Thanks.</description>

              <p>Alright well, we’ll figure out what to do about self-nominations among the staff members. Thanks for bringing it up Jc. I’ll close this thread for now.</p>

              <p>I also agree with you guys. I just thought it was against the rules, which is why I created this thread.</p>
<p>If this does occur though, I also would be against self-nomination.</p>

              <p>In a way, I agree with this. While I support people putting others forward for staff positions, I don’t feel comfortable talking with people who’ve suggested themselves. I don’t feel you can criticize them if they have flaws or talk openly about the candidate (that’s just me). I would personally re-word the rules to disallow self-nomination.</p>

              <p>I actually left that open hoping that people will nominate others for staff members. It’s not something we want to openly encourage (and we would be extremely strict on such a decision), but sometimes able members are easily overlooked by us.</p>
