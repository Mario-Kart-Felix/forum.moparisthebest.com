    <title>Changing QP on Skills tab to be pk points</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-qp-on-skills-tab-to-be-pk-points/297777</link>
    <description>Okay, I was told to put a code in the public boolean process() and it wasn&#39;t working. Maybe the wrong spot? But It says QP: 0 because I have 0 quest points. I tried CTRL+F: QP, but nothing would ever come up. I did that in EVERY .java file in my source folder.

[code]sendQuest(&quot;PVP: &quot;+pkpoints+&quot;&quot;, 3985);[/code]

This is what I was told to put in to change the QP to Represent PK points. It didn&#39;t work.

Any help on getting this to work would be extremely nice! Thanks!</description>
