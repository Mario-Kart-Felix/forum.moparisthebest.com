    <title>Server and Client Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-and-client-help/440003</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m gtree01 or Ghost. Moreover I used to program/code RSPS back in 2008-10. At that time the craze was like 317,459 and 508&#39;s were revolutionary. Anyways I&#39;m back wish I could remember my old login details. Well here&#39;s the thing. I downloaded Vistex Source/Client. I fixed the client error most leechers are getting and ran into another.

This is what happens. Please help! I have countd on Mopar before and I am counting on you all again! 

EDIT: I have cleaned up the code in a multitude of locations. Still doesn&#39;t work. It loads localhost on start up. I can copy my client.java if anyone is interested in helping...</description>
