    <title>Maths problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/maths-problem/202740</link>
    <description>i need some help with this its kinda annoying me.
If you have for example a set of numbers like this
6  10  25  32
and you work out the mean which is 24.3 recurring. Now this works by equal ratio meaning that each number is of equal value when you total it up. now lets say that we have two numbers
22  56
and we want to get the mean via an unequal ratio so that 56 counts for 75% of the final answer and the 22 counts for 25% of the final answer. How would i do that? if anyone can help it would be much appreciated</description>
