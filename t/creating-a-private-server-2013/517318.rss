    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-a-private-server-2013/517318</link>
    <description>I hope you didn&#39;t read the title wrong but I was wondering if anyone wana make a Private server with me. It can be any type of revision and I been coding for 4 year&#39;s now and took a break before and now I&#39;m back. If your intrested in creating and developing a P-Server with me HMU with your skills and etc and I&#39;ll see and I&#39;ll replent you with my career in coding and expertise.

(NOTE: I can provide VPS with $ but you have to be dedicated by offering up to with VPS for ea month we pay.)

<p>No that’s like saying you’re going to be a CEO of a company and your employees will pay you. Seems legit.</p>

<p>That doesn’t make much sense in English…</p>
<p>do you mean “dedicated by offering services” or “dedicated by splitting the bill”</p>
<p>Quite frankly, the time put into making a server, developing it, programming it, analyzing bugs, etc makes up much much more than just that and would require donations go to the programmer as well. That’s like saying your going to be a CEO of a company but not pay your employees.</p>
