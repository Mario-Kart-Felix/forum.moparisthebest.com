    <title>Portforwarding with 3G Modem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/portforwarding-with-3g-modem/380695</link>
    <description>I need help putting my server online. I don&#39;t have a router I have a Virgin Mobile 3G modem. (Don&#39;t hate). I was wondering if I could host with this (has to be a way since I have internet access). I&#39;ve heard about Utorrent and I put the port on their to 43594 and everything that the guides say. Still nothing. So if someone could help me I&#39;d really appreciate it.</description>
