Be skeptical when you have some evidence and see a motive for the actions. Thinking the government just like to to evil thing for the sake of being evil is just plain stupid.<br>

              <p>I was doing my shopping today and the alarm was triggered, we were told to evacuate the building. Police shut off the entire area, apparently there was a suspicious package that they thought was a bomb. I think it turned out to be a false alarm, but better safe than sorry given what’s just happened in France. I’d imagine the authorities are expecting something here in the UK, so are a little on edge.</p>

<p>That’s not the only reason I believe in it. It’s just good evidence that it’s real.</p>
<p>First off I don’t think everything around me is a lie. I, however, do question a lot of things which governments do and say. Why? Because they are known to lie and do evil and/or secret things. That’s not being stupid, it’s being cautious. What’s stupid is being brainwashed into believing everything around you.</p>

<p>No, no, no. You’re not allowed to do that. Unless your statement is uncontroversial, you are not allowed to tell anyone to look up information like this themselves.

<p>I don’t gotta do shit. I stated my opinion. There is lots of information out there that shows that this is a very likely false flag. If somebody wants to look into it, then do it. I’m not going to do it for you.</p>

<p>The moon landing was real. It would of been impossible to film a fake moon landing back then. We just simply didn’t have the film required to do it. There is a video out there somewhere that talks about it.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/sk8r">@Sk8r</a>, I sure do.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/bowser">@Bowser</a> jr, Many different governments have done it. Also, the U.S.A has already killed plenty of innocent citizens… So yeah…</p>

<p>No, no, no. You’re not allowed to do that. Unless your statement is uncontroversial, you are not allowed to tell anyone to look up information like this themselves. Give us some credible sources to back up your statement of GTFO and go to some of the less intellectual boards like off-topic and server-help.</p>

<p>I don’t gotta do shit. I stated my opinion. There is lots of information out there that shows that this is a very likely false flag. If somebody wants to look into it, then do it. I’m not going to do it for you.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/naseem142">@naseem142</a></p>
<p>Yep, because sadly 9/11 was also a false flag most likely. I haven’t looked into it fully yet, but it’s very likely it was.[/quote]</p>
