    <title>Php Warning (new to php)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/php-warning-new-to-php/329206</link>
    <description>When I say new to php, I know how to program, its just the technical setup/configurations i am unfamiliar with. Last time I checked the error log I found this, and would like to know how to get rid of the warning:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[12-Feb-2010 09:25:39] PHP Warning:  Module &#39;ffmpeg&#39; already loaded in Unknown on line 0

[13-Feb-2010 02:29:00] PHP Warning:  Module &#39;ffmpeg&#39; already loaded in Unknown on line 0&lt;/blockquote&gt;


the web host is remote and not on a local machine which i can remotely or physically access, other than my own cpanel from the site. I did some google search and did not understand the instructions because they mentioned something about .ini files.

the code i tried to write in OOP style, not sure if this has anything to do with the ffmpeg, (i dont know what ffmpeg is besides it being involved in OOP some how)

any help would be appreciated. thanks in advance

I have created some objects, and recreated them in other classes, not sure if this will cause the error also.</description>
