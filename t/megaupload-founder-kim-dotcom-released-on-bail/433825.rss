&lt;blockquote&gt;WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Kim Dotcom, the founder of the file-sharing website Megaupload, was released on bail Wednesday after a New Zealand judge determined that authorities have seized any funds he could have used to flee the country.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#39;m curious what direction the files are going in now?</description>
