    <description>right, so im working on a lottery system and its driving me nuts lol

ive got the majority done but i cant get it to draw the winner correctly im using arraylists that store the players name ive managed to get that far and i can get it to select and identify a winner from the arraylist but i need to figure out a way to get it to identify that player and define them as c so i can add the reward and such, cant seem to get my head around it lol

will be releasing the system when i figure it out :P

any help would be appreciated guys, 

thanks</description>
