[center][size=12pt][b]DO NOT REPLY WITH NEGATIVITY OR RUDENESS. KEEP IT TO YOURSELF.[/b][/size]

I&#39;m trying to build a small team for a RSPS project.
It&#39;ll be 718+. We&#39;ll be adding new content / features. 
I have a moderate / advanced level in java, and basic HTML programming skills.
I&#39;d like to have 2 Java developers, me and than someone else.
I&#39;ll need a GFX / Graphic artist, preferably someone who can do 3D / HD, and I&#39;d like a web developer.
I have alot I&#39;d like to do, and already have begun the project, and begun coding.
I was just picked up into a RSPS development team, which I also had resigned from due to the lack of owner /
other developer dedication.. I&#39;m looking for someone who&#39;s serious, and I&#39;m not giving much information just stressing the fact
I NEED SOMEONE SERIOUS, and dedicated and looking to go in on a successful project.
If you&#39;re interested, and want to talk about the server, or my plans, etc comment your skype name please, and I&#39;ll be getting in contact with you immediately, I&#39;ll let everyone know as spots and positions are filled.

- Thank you
