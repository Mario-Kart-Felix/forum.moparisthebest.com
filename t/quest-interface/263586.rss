    <description>Don&#39;t come on here being a jackass and say &quot;We don&#39;t spoon feed, use the search bar or google.&quot; I HAVE. So if you don&#39;t want to help, gtfo now.

Anyways, I&#39;m having problems with my quest interfaces. I&#39;m trying to get &#39;The Spells of the Gods&#39; quest to work (If any of you out there have it as well...Probobly. I&#39;ve had it on a few sources I&#39;ve tried.) But when I go to the quest menu it does not show quests....Now...I know how to change what it says...But when I click on any of the quests I put there....It does not open the menu/interface. The interface was previously set up on my source but it will not open....Any help please?</description>
