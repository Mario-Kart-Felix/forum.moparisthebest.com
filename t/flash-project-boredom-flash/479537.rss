    <title>[Flash] Project Boredom [Flash]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/flash-project-boredom-flash/479537</link>
    <description>So, I&#39;ve ran out of things to do in my school, and I&#39;m in &#39;love&#39; with Adobe Flash Pro (I&#39;ve got the beta for CS7 :D). So I&#39;ve decided I&#39;ll make some assets for websites on here. They will be customizable by the user, i.e not me or another flash editor. I don&#39;t mean full fledged flash websites, they are ASSETS. Meaning bits and pieces, though, I&#39;m sure you &#39;could&#39; put them all together on a single page to make it a flash site.

My first item is just about done. It&#39;s a customizable nav bar. You can edit almost everything. The only thing you can&#39;t edit is the actual background image for each icon (but you can change the color ;) ). It&#39;s all handled through XML.
here&#39;s a line of the xml I used (clunky, in a way):
[code=xml]&lt;LINK TITLE=&quot;Everything is set through&quot; COLOR=&quot;00FF33&quot;BACKCOLOR=&quot;0000DD&quot; WIDTH=&quot;200&quot; HEIGHT=&quot;26&quot; LKWIDTH=&quot;200&quot; LHEIGHT=&quot;18&quot; XPOS=&quot;100&quot; YPOS=&quot;0&quot; TXPOS=&quot;0&quot; TYPOS=&quot;3&quot; TSIZE=&quot;18&quot;&gt;http://www.google.com&lt;/LINK&gt;
[/code]
Here&#39;s a the description I&#39;ve added in my xml document on what each does:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;!--
How it works:
the &lt;BACKGROUND&gt;HexCode&lt;/BACKGROUND&gt; Assigns the color of the background of the nav bar.
W: (In BACKGROUND) Deals with the width of the background, it&#39;s a color element. Default is 225.
H: (In BACKGROUND) Deals with the height of the background, it&#39;s a color element. Default is 600.
TITLE: The text on each nav item.
COLOR: It&#39;s the text color. It is done in HEX, without the #. AS3 (ActionScript 3) puts 0x, instead of #, which is already added
by me, in the code.
BACKCOLOR: You guessed it, it changes the color of the background.
WIDTH: the width of the back of the nav object.
HEIGHT: The height of back of the nav object.
LKWIDTH: The width of the text box. All text is set to center.
LHEIGHT: The Line height of the text box in which your title is held. The default text is set to 12.
XPOS: The X position of each back.
YPOS: The Y position of each back.
TXPOS: The X position of each text box.
TYPOS: The Y position of each text box.
TSIZE: The size of the text.

Extra info:
If title is set to &quot;null&quot;, it will remove that nav item. I made it so it works with all forms of the word null.
The text between the link tags: This is the link itself. Remember to add http:// or https://. Otherwise it will NOT work.
The default height of the background is 26px.
The default height of the text is 18px.
Multiline only works if you have the &quot;LHEIGHT&quot; set to at least double the text size.

Default Variables:
TITLE: &quot;null&quot;
COLOR: &quot;000000&quot;
BACKCOLOR: &quot;FFFFFF&quot;
WIDTH: &quot;200&quot;
HEIGHT: &quot;26&quot;
LKWIDTH: &quot;200&quot;
LHEIGHT: &quot;18&quot;
XPOS: &quot;100&quot; (+100 per nav item)
YPOS: &quot;0&quot; (+30 per nav item)
TXPOS: &quot;0&quot;
TYPOS: &quot;YPOS + 3&quot;
TSIZE: 12
--&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The only &#39;issue&#39; that comes with this, is if I make the main image with rounded corners, if you extend it too far, the rounded corners start to stretch.

[IMG]http://i50.tinypic.com/10dbcjr.png[/img]

This image uses the xml i posted above. It&#39;s the first &quot;LINK&quot; them.
If I set the variable TITLE to null (and it can be &quot;Null&quot;, &quot;NULL&quot;, etc. I made a check for that) it removes that one, and no more.

And yes, you can change the digscusting bright green background. That&#39;s done here:
[code=xml]&lt;BACKGROUND W=&quot;225&quot;H=&quot;600&quot;&gt;00FF00&lt;/BACKGROUND&gt;[/code]

My next project is going to be a youtube player.</description>

Well, I wouldn’t know how to even begin making this in html5. I know how to make a nav bar in html 5. that isn’t hard what so ever; but making a near-replica of this, where it’s all edited in xml, isn’t something I could just come up and do. I’ve been wanting to learn php, so I might take a crack at that now, but I’m still going to use Flash later on, I mean, that youtube player won’t be too shabby to have.</p>

<p>EDIT:<br>
I’d put adding a copy button under the same umbrella as making some links open in new tabs/windows. It should be the user’s choice whether they want to open something in a new tab or not (by middle clicking or right click &gt; open in new tab).</p>

<p>I disable flash by default and had almost never needed to re-enable. It’s only used on older video streaming sites right now.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
To OP, never, ever use flash for any important part of the website (navigation block, main article titles). It’s probably one of the worst usability things you can do and looks extremely amateurish. In the example you showed, an HTML/CSS version would be a lot cleaner looking and easier to manage anyway so I don’t really see the point in using Flash here to begin with.</p>

No. CSS and HTML is superior for what you want to do. Your design doesn’t even look good. The standard Youtube player from youtube is superior to anything you can make. You should also (almost) never use absolute positioning in web-design. Don’t force the users to view your site in a certain size. Make games and/or iPhone apps if you want to use flash and stay away from web-design (That you do not manage do to properly).[/quote]<br>

<p>Plus, I made this simply because I was bored. Oh, and how do you know how well MY player will be. You haven’t even seen the start of it, unlike youtube’s standard player, mine will load all the videos you tell it to, and play them in order, or you can click thumbnails of others that you have posted, and it will play those instead.</p>

Would advise against using/learning flash, it’ll be dead in a couple of years, better off getting to grips with html5.</p>
<p>edit: sorry, but I don’t see why this would be done in flash? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  All this can be done using one block element and some CSS attributes.</p>
<p>Looking forward to the youtube player though.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Flash isn’t going to die, not yet. Unless html pulls some serious animation out of it’s arse.<br>
Honestly, I made it in Flash simply cause I’m bored in school.<br>
And I’m having a couple ‘complications’ with the player, but it shouldn’t be too long.[/quote]<br>

<p>You’ve probably been hearing a lot lately about how Flash is a dying technology and how it’ll soon be replaced by HTML5. Personally, I think that it will slowly replace Flash for some things, but Flash will always have a place, especially for...</p>

“most probably” wasn’t needed, the sentence should have been: No it wont be, in 100000 years it probably wont be supported…<br>
You also missed a apostrophe in won’t.<br>
You put to instead of “too”.<br>
Oh, but I’m not smart enough to see any of these.<br>

You caring if it is or isn’t doesn’t matter at all.<br>
No it wont be, in 100000 years it wont be supported most probably (using your own technical thing against you just to emphasise how stupid that was although it doesn’t show much since what I said is fairly reasonable).<br>

You told me? That’s quite authorotive, shame you aren’t someone of power or authority. If you can give me a valid reason that is of course reasonable I will get of the topic.

Why should I waste the time to point out the obvious flaws you left there, when it has nothing to do with our discussion, explain that to me. Everyone makes mistakes, everyone has their flaws. Maybe mine is liking flash. I know “100000 years” is exaggeration, but you know, technology moves only so fast, and maybe in that time frame, HTML won’t exist anymore.<br>
Oh, and I guess since you want a reason you should get off my topic. It’s cause I can’t care to argue, or discuss, which is better, Flash or html. Considering html5 is using more features that aren’t html itself, that’s an unfair judgement. It uses a lot of javascript, jQuery, and other languages. This has nothing to do with how I feel about you. I don’t hate you, I don’t like you, I personally have no judgement on you. I can’t call you a “good guy” or a “bad guy” because I only know you through some forums. That’s not a proper way to meet a person.</p>

<p>Do you not understand how technology is changing? How big the mobile phone (cell phone) market is…? People are using Flash less than previously hence “as it used to be”. Their will be more stable better alternatives to Flash soon which will be popular and Flash will die.<br>
God, why do I have to spell things out for you.[/quote]<br>
Technically, you haven’t spelled ANYTHING out for me. I told you once, get off my topic.<br>
I don’t really care if it’s “not as supported as it used to be”<br>
It’s supported through PCs. and always will be.<br>
They just decided to pull out of the mobile browser market. Though, that has NOTHING to do with this, considering I don’t see anyone playing a rsps on a mobile. Unless it was a tablet or ipad.</p>

That’s why they are still making updates to Flash 11… And that’s why they are working on CS7 (codename Adobe Hellcat).</p>
