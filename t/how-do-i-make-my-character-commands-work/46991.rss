    <title>How do I make my character commands work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-make-my-character-commands-work/46991</link>
    <description>Hey. How do I make the commands that I make work? I made one and when Id compile (Itd be the same as an item command) and itd say 63 errors... Then i could fix it... and when i edited tools to make it ::cash, it worked... so when it said commandstartswith(&quot;tools&quot;)) i changed it to (&quot;cash&quot;)) and made the items that appear turn into cash... and it worked. I also added text to it so when you pick it up it said &quot;Youre now rich&quot;... I had to delete that later on when I tried to make my own... but itll be back. So my question is how do I make the commands I make work??? (and i copied the exact thing below it aaaand also put the {,}, and ; in the right place... along with the spaces)</description>
