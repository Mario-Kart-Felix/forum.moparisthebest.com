    <title>InnovationX 317 - Release - Updated - No SQL/MYSQL - RENAMED</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/innovationx-317-release-updated-no-sql-mysql-renamed/482430</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;[size=14pt]First off I would like to say I love InnovationX 317 back then, and it&#39;s sad that they&#39;re not probably going to be putting up the real IX back up, so I felt like I needed to redo some stuff, change some names, change some stuff up and disabled MYSQL/SQL. 

The client is about 90% fixed, it logs and and everything, I fixed the &quot;MAPS&quot; that were causing an error and glitch.

So yeah, leechers are going to leech, and leechers are going to eventually find this so why not release already? Anyways, enjoy guys! Don&#39;t forget to REP me and comment. :)[/size]&lt;/blockquote&gt;




This server has had it&#39;s ups and downs. Reaching &gt; 1000 players and going &lt; 50.

[b][u]THIS IS NOT YOUR STANDARD BATTLESCAPE/WINTERLOVE. IT&#39;S NETWORKING IS REDONE IT CAN EASILY HOLD 2000 PLAYERS!![/u][/b]


NOTE: [b]I removed MYSQL/SQL for you guys, so have fun and REP me![/b] You&#39;re All Welcome!!

[b]World-Class Hosting[/b]
When we say world-class, we mean it. InnovationX is hosted off a dedicated physical server located in St. Louis, USA. St. Louis USA contains the most powerful internet infrastructure in the United States. We are proud to say we buy from [b][url=http://www.serverloft.com]Serverloft Dedicated Server Solutions[/url][/b].
    *  Fujitsu PRIMERGY RX200 with Intel D2786 Chipset
    * 2x Xeon E5520, 2x Quadcore (8 core) - Nehalem
    * 8 GB DDR3 DIMM-RAM
    * 2x 500 GB SATA II HDDs, 7.200rpm
    * RAID 1
    * 10.000 GB data transfer
    * Server location in Atlanta, Georgia/USA


[b]Live Radio DJ[/b]
We are now offering our own live radio stream with a professional DJ - Evan. We plays various genres that include rap, hip hop, rock, pop, electric, metal, jazz, and sometimes we play funny commercials like the WTF Blanket!?! commercial.


[b]Live Support System[/b]
When we say live support, we mean it. InnovationX has selected trusted members of the community to serve as [b]Live Support Operators[/b]. We always have [b]3[/b] [b]Live Support Operators[/b] online. Each [b]Live Support Operator[/b] has been chosen according to their time-zone and languages spoken. For example, when it is 3:00 AM in the United States, there will be Australian and Asian [b]Live Support Operators[/b] online, as across the earth it is 3:00 PM and many will need support. [b]MOST[/b] of our [b]Live Support Operators[/b] are fluent in more than 1 language, in fact some are so well, they speak [b]4 different languages[/b]! We currently use [b]LiveZilla FREE[/b] for our Live Support system.

[b]Dedication To It&#39;s Best[/b]
InnovationX is dedicated to serving customers, such as you. We want you to experience a new type of private server, one in which is a democracy. We don&#39;t do things without asking your opinion of it first. Nearly all of our updates have fair-polls that are open to the public. People can vote whether or not the update would enhance InnovationX. [b]ALL[/b] of our staff members are voted on by current staff members, keeping staff quality upright.

[b]The Forums[/b]
Here at InnovationX, we hate illegal affairs. Our [b]vBulletin[/b] forums are [b][u]PAID[/u][/b] as well as our themes.

Here&#39;s a few facts:
[spoiler=Show Facts][b]1)[/b] You cannot use any version of the software without a license.
[b]2)[/b] You void all your warranty and support by using ANY version of the software other than the one you obtained via members area here.
[b]3)[/b] You void all your warranty and support by editing the version of the software you downloaded via members area.
[b]4)[/b] Nulled version have a lot of known security issues which I will not outline. By using them (which is illegal in 99% of the case), you open your forum, and everything associated with it up to hackers and malicious users.
[b]5)[/b] Your host may close your account (this applies to dedicated/colocated servers in datacenters) when they notice you are housing illegal software using their bandwidth, even if you are rightfully licensed.
[b]6)[/b] Jelsoft can, have been, and always will take appropriate legal actions against those using vBulletin illegally.[/spoiler]

Our forums are [b]ACTIVE[/b]. Unlike other server&#39;s forums, when you post something, expect it to be answered in a few minutes, not a few weeks. Here at InnovationX we are proud to have one of the most active forums in RSPS.

              <blockquote>[size=14pt]First off I would like to say I love InnovationX 317 back then, and it's sad that they're not probably going to be putting up the real IX back up, so I felt like I needed to redo some stuff, change some names, change some stuff up and disabled MYSQL/SQL. 
<p>The client is about 90% fixed, it logs and and everything, I fixed the “MAPS” that were causing an error and glitch.</p>
<p>So yeah, leechers are going to leech, and leechers are going to eventually find this so why not release already? Anyways, enjoy guys! Don’t forget to REP me and comment. :)[/size]</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">World-Class Hosting</span><br>
When we say world-class, we mean it. InnovationX is hosted off a dedicated physical server located in St. Louis, USA. St. Louis USA contains the most powerful internet infrastructure in the United States. We are proud to say we buy from <span class="bbcode-b"><a href="http://www.serverloft.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Serverloft Dedicated Server Solutions</a></span>.<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Live Radio DJ</span><br>
We are now offering our own live radio stream with a professional DJ - Evan. We plays various genres that include rap, hip hop, rock, pop, electric, metal, jazz, and sometimes we play funny commercials like the WTF Blanket!?! commercial.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Live Support System</span><br>
When we say live support, we mean it. InnovationX has selected trusted members of the community to serve as <span class="bbcode-b">Live Support Operators</span>. We always have <span class="bbcode-b">3</span> <span class="bbcode-b">Live Support Operators</span> online. Each <span class="bbcode-b">Live Support Operator</span> has been chosen according to their time-zone and languages spoken. For example, when it is 3:00 AM in the United States, there will be Australian and Asian <span class="bbcode-b">Live Support Operators</span> online, as across the earth it is 3:00 PM and many will need support. <span class="bbcode-b">MOST</span> of our <span class="bbcode-b">Live Support Operators</span> are fluent in more than 1 language, in fact some are so well, they speak <span class="bbcode-b">4 different languages</span>! We currently use <span class="bbcode-b">LiveZilla FREE</span> for our Live Support system.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Dedication To It’s Best</span><br>
InnovationX is dedicated to serving customers, such as you. We want you to experience a new type of private server, one in which is a democracy. We don’t do things without asking your opinion of it first. Nearly all of our updates have fair-polls that are open to the public. People can vote whether or not the update would enhance InnovationX. <span class="bbcode-b">ALL</span> of our staff members are voted on by current staff members, keeping staff quality upright.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The Forums</span><br>
Here at InnovationX, we hate illegal affairs. Our <span class="bbcode-b">vBulletin</span> forums are <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">PAID</span></span> as well as our themes.</p>
<p>Here’s a few facts:<br>
[spoiler=Show Facts]<span class="bbcode-b">1)</span> You cannot use any version of the software without a license.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">2)</span> You void all your warranty and support by using ANY version of the software other than the one you obtained via members area here.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">3)</span> You void all your warranty and support by editing the version of the software you downloaded via members area.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">4)</span> Nulled version have a lot of known security issues which I will not outline. By using them (which is illegal in 99% of the case), you open your forum, and everything associated with it up to hackers and malicious users.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">5)</span> Your host may close your account (this applies to dedicated/colocated servers in datacenters) when they notice you are housing illegal software using their bandwidth, even if you are rightfully licensed.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">6)</span> Jelsoft can, have been, and always will take appropriate legal actions against those using vBulletin illegally.[/spoiler]</p>
<p>Our forums are <span class="bbcode-b">ACTIVE</span>. Unlike other server’s forums, when you post something, expect it to be answered in a few minutes, not a few weeks. Here at InnovationX we are proud to have one of the most active forums in RSPS.</p>
