    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-are-people-getting-disconnected/247798</link>
    <description>On my server it&#39;s a Dddspeced made by jayden. There be about 45 players online and you can do ::pickup and ::master any reason why 5-15 players get kicked offed? Also it says error connecting and you have to mass click  login back in the server. Is it because to many people doing ::pickup?</description>
