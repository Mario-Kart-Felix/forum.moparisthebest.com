***Reasons to join now***

The server may not be 24/7 yet but considering i&#39;m hosting it on my computer chances are if the servers up I will be on it or monitoring it

The server is Beta right now meaning it&#39;s not 100% yet. Their are bound to be some glitches and bugs but some may work to the players advantage. For example some things like the random reward box might still give to expensive rewards making it easy to obtain cash until I fix it. I&#39;ve tested it and it seems fine for now but i&#39;m only 1 person I can&#39;t be certain it&#39;s gonna be the same when a lot of people are using it. So long story short it might be easier to obtain cash and items now so takeadvantage of that and join now!

Another good incentive for joining is rares. Most rares are obtainable now through drops from bosses, the random rewards box and a few other ways and as they are obtained their rarity will be increased and when theirs a sufficient amount in the game they will no longer be able to be obtained so get them while you can!

Going along with what I previously said about being able to get things easier Pkers and people who like to kill monsters might find it easier to obtain certain things.

Joining now also means you&#39;ll be able to influence what happens to the server, what updates are made and what content is added.
