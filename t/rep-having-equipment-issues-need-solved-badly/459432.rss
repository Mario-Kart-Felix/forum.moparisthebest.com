    <title>[Rep++] Having Equipment Issues, Need Solved Badly</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rep-having-equipment-issues-need-solved-badly/459432</link>
    <description>Alright, so im having this wierd problem. When you equip a helmet your head will disappear. If you have a cape on, it will also disappear. Remove helmet, cape reappears. Im not sure if its client or server side but i will be posting both so someone can help fix.

If you fix this, i will give you rep, plus I will give you my server and client in it&#39;s final release when it&#39;s ready. Both open source. No questions asked.

Just start up the server and the client and get a helmet and a cape. And see what i Mean. I need this problem fixed asap. [b]THIS IS AN ORIGINAL 317.

PS. I think theres a byte not matching or a wrong int. Im not sure and I cant get fucking Rune-Server do a damn thing.</description>

              <p>I have an idea of the problem, but I’m not sure if I understand correctly. Does this happen with any helmet and cape combination, or just specific ones?</p>
