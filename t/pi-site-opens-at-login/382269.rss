    <title>[PI] Site opens at login</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-site-opens-at-login/382269</link>
    <description>Hello,

I&#39;ve lately downloaded a server and I have a lil problem I never experienced before...

Always when I log in, it makes my main internet browser open a website (it was the main site of the server).
I really find that annoying because i have a really slow pc and it lags ALOT!

[b]What I&#39;ve found out so far:[/b]
- I managed to change the site. how? changing it in this code:
[code]
getPA().sendFrame126(&quot;Website &amp; Forum&quot;, 29163); //2nd section title
		getPA().sendFrame126(&quot;www.google.com&quot;, 29164); //2nd section content
	}
[/code]
This is a code that show the lines in the quest tab. so I think it must be something that reads that line and go to there...

Hope someone can help...</description>
