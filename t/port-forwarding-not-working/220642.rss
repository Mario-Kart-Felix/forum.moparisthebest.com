    <title>Port Forwarding not working</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/port-forwarding-not-working/220642</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve read many tutorials on how to port forward and ive followed all of them step by step. I have a no-ip accoutn and everything, set my port up in my firewall, thru my linksys, and it still doesnt allow others to join me. Does anybody have any idea on how to go about resolving this? Is there anything else i need to do or any other way to host it?</description>
