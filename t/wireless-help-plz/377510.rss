    <title>Wireless help - plz!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wireless-help-plz/377510</link>
    <description>Ok. i installed xubuntu 10.10 on my laptop. everything works well. my pc connects to my phone tether(which is ad-hoc). internet connection is good. so i come home from college over the weekend, connect to both my wireless routers. sometimes the only web site i can connect to is google, and it times out on like every other website. why? sometimes i can download from the ubuntu repo without having to connect to ethernet. its not my router all my other computers have no problem. i have not problem on the same laptop when im in windows 7. i thought it may be a driver problem, but why would i be able to bring up google? and connect to ad-hoc and not have any problems? if it is a driver idk how to find the right one(i should check oem&#39;s site for drivers i guess but i thought they[ubuntu] had a program that gave u a list of like every driver.)

thx</description>
