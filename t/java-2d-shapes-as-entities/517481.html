Look, I’m not hating on you specifically but I am so sick and tired of seeing topics in this section that can be much better answers in countless ways using sites Google brings up. You’re literally asking us how to handle objects that move, AKA how to write a game loop and update the game’s objects.

Please, rely on Google for questions like these.<br>
[/quote]I am not looking for spoon feeding, and trust me, I’ve done my gooling and research. I asked for opinions on what the best way of handling this is. No offence, but I suggest reading the OP before making assumptions. [size=1pt]Sometimes I worry about you.[/size][/quote]I did read the OP, and I’m confident in what I said. What you’re asking us for is the equivalent of writing a game engine. But, since you want help here (which generally isn’t a good place to ask, seeing how only a few active people would be able to really help), I’ll give you a brief answer.</p>
<p>You’ve got a few basic ways of doing it: A solid list of objects that gets iterated through and updates each object every frame, a list of objects for a specific region equipped with a list of objects that need updating and event-based updating. All of the above can actually be merged into one, but I take it you won’t be dealing with more than 100 objects, so the first choice will be the easiest and should do just fine.</p>
<p>These objects will contain position, velocity and “destroy” variables. If you want a more abstract approach, which probably isn’t necessary, you’ll have a base object containing these properties and a specific class for each type of shape extending it. Inside the class will be an update method, which gets called every frame. This is where moving, rotating and checking for collisions will be done. You’ll also have another method for rendering, which you’ll pass in (probably) a Graphics parameter. Assuming you clear the canvas every frame (which you should), you just draw the shape at the position.</p>
<p>So that brings you to your last class, which is the core of your engine. You have a fixed-time cycle that runs as long as the program is open and inside it (assuming you’re doing the first method of objects) loop twice through your objects. The first time, you’ll call their Update method and the second time, disposing and removing them from your list if their “destroy” property is set. You’ll also have another fixed-time cycle similar to the first that calls the render method for each object.</p>
<p>And that’s how to write the most basic and ‘efficient’ game, or cycle- and dynamic object-based program.</p>
