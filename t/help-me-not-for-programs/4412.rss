    <description>As you may or may not know, Rs-resources has been working on a new bot called ARGA. it is revolutionary in design. An old version of it (it has been greatly improved and recoded) was stolen from the development server by RLN. He posted it on his forum, and we were successfully able to get it removed.

but:

(09:34:03 AM) aaron                :^): its ok its not that i would release it
[b](09:34:06 AM) aaron                :^): i would just send it to anyone i know
(09:34:10 AM) aaron                :^): and tell them to give it out[/b]
(09:37:15 AM) aaron                :^): ok
(09:37:17 AM) aaron                :^): no comments?
(09:37:19 AM) aaron                :^): thats what i thought
(09:37:21 AM) aaron                :^): moron
(09:44:19 AM) aaron                :^): ?
(09:47:04 AM) aaron                :^): banned me
(09:47:05 AM) aaron                :^): lmfao
(09:47:06 AM) aaron                :^): ok
(09:47:10 AM) aaron                :^): its getting released

So I ask of you, if you notice code floating around dealing with ARGA, MacroSoft, arga.rar, argagui, HiJack, etc, please report it to the admins of the forum and let me know about it so I can keep track.</description>

<li>Make something and spend time on it. Then you can talk. As you know many programs are sold. Nothing wrong with selling it even if we did. We didnt even want to sell it. W just didnt want leeches.

afi,<br>
the bot is authed,but free…(in most cases)<br>
Acting like this isn’t going to get much anywhere…your just acting like an angry 8 year old that can’t get “dem geepeez”.<br>
If your that sad,to flame people who can code…just…leave.<br>
Taios has always released aryan updates for free back in the days,and this is what you treat her like? Let me guess,you <em>attempted</em> to make the sbot owner(s) feel bad didn’t you?<br>
I’ve already got a free auth for helping an admin on the rs-r community…you don’t have to pay,you just need to be a good member of the community.<br>
[me=DeadBird]wanders around thinking why bots aren’t openly released for free and then thinks because they land in the hands of people like afi[/me]<br>
Even if I wouldn’t get an auth out of it,and I saw some bot lying around cracked I would tell the creators. Why? I respect programmers and the work they put into things.<br>
If they choose to charge for <span class="bbcode-b">their</span> work (sorry impsoft,I still don’t forgive what you did with aryan but we’re still friends or whatever  :P) then let them be. Its their work.</p>
