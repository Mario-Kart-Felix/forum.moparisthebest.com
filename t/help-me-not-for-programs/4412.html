<li>Make something and spend time on it. Then you can talk. As you know many programs are sold. Nothing wrong with selling it even if we did. We didnt even want to sell it. W just didnt want leeches. We now have a new way to rid leeches and have a free bot so its perfect for us. So basically afi. SDFU. It is no offence people like you who make people not want to release bots and thus at one point ARGA was going to be a private creation because leeches would be something we didnt want to handle.</li>

<blockquote>Tiaos Quit trying to feel Indulgent.</blockquote>
Don't try to look smart.
<blockquote>Indulgent
<p>adj 1: showing or characterized by or given to indulgence; “indulgent grandparents” [ant: nonindulgent] 2: tolerant or lenient; “indulgent parents risk spoiling their children”; “procedures are lax and discipline is weak”; “too soft on the children” [syn: lax, lenient, soft] 3: being favorably inclined; “an indulgent attitude”</p>

<li>Make something and spend time on it. Then you can talk. As you know many programs are sold. Nothing wrong with selling it even if we did. We didnt even want to sell it. W just didnt want leeches. We now have a new way to rid leeches and have a free bot so its perfect for us. So basically afi. SDFU. It is no offence people like you who make people not want to release bots and thus at one point ARGA was going to be a private creation because leeches would be something we didnt want to handle.</li>
</ol>
<p>It was coming anyways. Im just glad it was an early revision.</p>
<p>Meh, it was a fairly old revision RLN released so, doesnt really matter. Fair play to him.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Funny. If you been on rsr, you would know we have decided to release it free. </span></p>
<p>Edit  : <span class="bbcode-b">Source has been released, well semi source, see hacking tips</span></p>

<p>afi,<br>
the bot is authed,but free…(in most cases)<br>
Acting like this isn’t going to get much anywhere…your just acting like an angry 8 year old that can’t get “dem geepeez”.<br>
If your that sad,to flame people who can code…just…leave.<br>
Taios has always released aryan updates for free back in the days,and this is what you treat her like? Let me guess,you <em>attempted</em> to make the sbot owner(s) feel bad didn’t you?<br>
I’ve already got a free auth for helping an admin on the rs-r community…you don’t have to pay,you just need to be a good member of the community.<br>
[me=DeadBird]wanders around thinking why bots aren’t openly released for free and then thinks because they land in the hands of people like afi[/me]<br>
Even if I wouldn’t get an auth out of it,and I saw some bot lying around cracked I would tell the creators. Why? I respect programmers and the work they put into things.<br>
If they choose to charge for <span class="bbcode-b">their</span> work (sorry impsoft,I still don’t forgive what you did with aryan but we’re still friends or whatever  :P) then let them be. Its their work.</p>

<p>For One I only Use aryan When RegeX Realsed it at Kaitneiks forums.THe second thing I only used Mopararyan Updater when It came out I never used any OTHER BOT NOR DID I USE SLAVE BOT. Tiaos Quit trying to feel Indulgent.<br>

From the look at this,I bet you were one of the “update the fucking bot regex you asshole” people,weren’t you?<br>
and what is with your words…like…a mix of starting with caps and not.</p>
