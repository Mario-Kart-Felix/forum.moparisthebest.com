    <title>How to add handlers for objects?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-add-handlers-for-objects/366581</link>
    <description>When playing, I see that opening gates and stuff give me handling debug messages in the server.
I&#39;m using bulby.
Where and how do I handle the stuff?
Gates and doors do not work, help is very much appreciated, as i JUST got Castle Wars to work.
Or if someone doesn&#39;t mine pastebinning their working Bulby ObjectOption1.java that handles everything, that would be nice, too.
If you want further information, http://pastebin.com/whPUWwrq is my ObjectOption1.java</description>
