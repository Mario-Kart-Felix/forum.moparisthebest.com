    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-help-needed-pls-317/368198</link>
    <description>hey guys these are my problems.
1. when i add my chatlog command and compile it i get errors! :( so if anyone could send me there code it add it pls.

2. when you train you click (block, stab, slash) to select your exp well with mine on melee weps when the xp is in the wrong place and i dont know how to change it. e.g. selecting block should let me train defence exp well it makes me train attack exp so pls help.

3. in edge i wish to change the wildy level&#39;s currently they start off at 1 and go up, i would like to make the hole wildy level 50 so there isn&#39;t any level difference.

and my last thing 4. currently when i cast a spell on a monster/person its a 3-4 second delay till it hits them. i would like to change it so it hits them as soon as i cast it on them.

thankyou for help in advance : ]</description>
