    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/recruiting-advisors-and-developpers-sane-encode/401960</link>
    <description>Dear members of the Moparscape society,
with this message I want to recruit people to invent and think about new ideas (storyline/features) around a 603 Runescape private server. The reason for this shortage of helping hands in our project is the bustle of our business. If you are interested you can contact us on the email address ([email]sane.encode@hotmail.com[/email]). We will add you into our messenger group if you apply, so we can discuss about allotments.

[size=14pt]I still need database experts, runescape data fetchers, data-explorers, high experienced cache coders.[/size]

[u]the email must contain;[/u]
-basic information?
-graphical experience?
-Runescape knowledge?
-other specialties?


[u]Some information about Sane Encode;[/u]
We&#39;re a 603 Runescape private server in development of a new structure and never seen features in this part of private servers before, containing a brand new communicating and appeal tool. We have been working with experienced and mature coders/advisors since November &#39;10. This server is not yet released and is not meant to fetch money, it is more like a project to us.

[size=8pt]&quot;All the inventions and new tools/programs made within our society will stay in our group and will not be released&quot;, everything from NPC - GFX lists are made and prepared to work on this server on an efficient way.[/size]

Hope to see you in the future!
Kind regards,
team Sane Encode

<p>I need your e-mail. I will adopt you into our messenger group and we will see what you can do for us, it’s the runescape knowledge which is very useful. forums, GFX and bug fixes are being fixed by a high experienced team, the only development I still need are database experts and script writers, me and my coder are in force to do anything but I need more helping hands on this distinct.</p>

<p>EDIT: Anyways, Good Luck with your development tread ;)[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m pleased to adopt you into our messenger group (e-mail needed), I do have to note that almost all bugs are patched but otherwise bugs will always exist. It’s more about the ideas for a storyline, because I’m out of ideas, the future players you were writing about, we will not finish this project with haste nor deadlines. So it can take a few months still. But until then, hope you enjoy our small group of advisors.</p>
