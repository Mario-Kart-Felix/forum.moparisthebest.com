and wtf reallt i am sorry but the post you made was completly worng becuase yes they can sue you heck i can sue you for use my source i might release tommor or in a few weeks(like i would lol i wouldnt though cuase that would be mean) but yes runescape A.K.A Jagex can sue you for not doing what they ask[/quote]no it is still their intellectual property and code/graphics so they will always win, unless you re-do the WHOLE client and EVERYTHING and basically make a new game. and no you cant, because you didnt copyright your source with 10+ lawyers signing a contract. and they can sue you for hosting it at all, ask stork or reines if you dont believe me. if they take you to court, they WILL win because they have all rights to it because it is using their code and EVERYTHING else. so you are wrong.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Tico135, post:12, topic:218734”]Unless you are selling membership, or disobey them when they tell you to close down your server, I wouldn’t worry about legal action being taken.  For example, stork’s old server ‘stork pk’ was taken down because Jagex had contacted stork telling him to take down the server or they would take legal action. [/quote]yeah, but they tell all rsc servers to get taken down. they dont bother taking down rs2 servers because they constantly update rs2.</p>
<p>[quote=“wtfnub, post:15, topic:218734”]you cant get sued for a private server. jagex knows bout moparscape and silab. if u didnt notice theres always runescape ads at the top. jagex makes them put it there. no1 got sued all lies.[/quote]sorry, but holy fucking shit you are stupid… you can get sued and lose in court because it steals their intellectual property, as well as code and graphics. they have every right to take down servers, and would win in court.<br>
about the ads: they dont put the ads there you idiot, the ads are random from google (hence it saying “[size=22pt]ads by google[/size]”). shit, your stupid. but then again, im sure you knew that jagex wouldnt want people stealing their game and all of their graphics and calling it their own, and letting people get away with running private servers of THEIR game. unless, you really are that stupid which i think you are.</p>
