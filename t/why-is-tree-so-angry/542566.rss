<p>[quote=“Tree, post:1, topic:432075”]moparisthebest edit:<br>
This is hilarious stuff, probably because I never responded to Tree’s pathetic begging for awards in a PM to me:</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>I thought i’d send this to you because in the end, you hold the final decision. Contacting anyone else under you would be a waste of my time. As you know, I’ve been around a fair while. I outdate many, many members here. I know the ins and outs of this scene too well. While i might come off arrogant and egotistical, it’s my method of educating members. Drumming in the idea that being spoonfed is a terrible way of educating ones self. Just like when i started, i copped barrages of insults and unhelpful compliments. Through this though, i learned to track down my own resources. It bettered me.</p>
<p>Now around a year or two ago you stripped me of all my titles. It was a choice between staying banned (for an inappropriate rant at a female member here), or that. My love for the community really only left me with one choice. I thought i would be okay becoming more of a shadow here. Workloads were increasing and i was working on a number of private projects. I didn’t have the time for the politics of it all.</p>
<p>Now i’m back browsing this forum on a regular basis, i find that lacking my earned awards sets me back. Advice that i give falls on deaf ears because the source seems unreliable. To new members, i’m simply a nobody. I know you’re a reasonable guy because you’ve allowed me to stay here, despite certain altercations i’ve had other members. On the grand scale of things, they were only minor.</p>
<p>Through contribution and hard work, i gained my Java Cup. A goal i was working towards for a while. I’m asking that my Java Cup at least be reinstated. If anything, I’m even more knowledgable on the topic than before. I would be lying if i said that i will drop my condescending attitude towards members, thought i can certainly tone it down. I’m still as blunt and to the point as i was, just less about ‘climbing the power ladder’. I simply wants to be recognised for what i’ve achieved, which is that cup.</p>
<p>I know it’s a big ask. After this many years of being together in the same community, i hope you can grant me the favour.</p>
<p>Much appreciated,<br>
Tree.</p>

MAIN THREAD: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,534783.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,534783.0.html</a></p>
<p>[center]For those who haven’t heard the news, we’ve lost our most valuable member. Yesterday while on a hunting trip with three friends, an accidental shot was let off and hit Travis in the leg. Even after immediately being rushed to Charlton Methodist Hospital, Travis lost his battle for life around 8.17am. An obituary will be posted later on this evening.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DF3Zw.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>For those who didn’t know travis personally, he was a great man. A loving husband. Intelligent student. A keen fitness machine. I’m sure he would have made a wonderful father. Our best wishes go out to his family who are currently mourning.</p>
<p>I thought i would release a few unknown facts about Travis:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Travis was actually chess champion in year 6 when he attended school. It was only later on that he discovered he wished to be a professional ski instructor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Travis used to run marathons. He told me once that without the burn of a marathon, he would have never been able to kick his alcohol problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Travis originally ran a mail order bride website before mopar. <a href="http://Mopargivesthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Mopargivesthebest.com</a>. After meeting his wife on the same site, this project was soon shut down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very little profit is made from this website. Travis used all his drug money to keep this place going, selling pills and herbs of all sort. All off his own back.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What happens now?</span></p>
<p>There’s a lot of people interested in what’s going to happen to this community now that he has passed. Myself and Greeny were the closest to Travis and a plan was made around a year ago to eventually give up ownership to one of us. We’re currently thinking of a dual-ownership.</p>
<p>For this week, we will begin mourning. Any comments left on here for travis will be included in a leather-bound book that will be presented to his wife on the funeral day. I trust you will all keep them appropriate.</p>
<p>The name will stay. The place will change. We have some new systems that we wish to implement.<br>
We plan on releasing a Mopar iphone app that allows other members to see where others are.</p>
<p>R.I.P Travis, A Great Man.</p>
