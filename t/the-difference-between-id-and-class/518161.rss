    <title>The Difference Between ID and Class!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-difference-between-id-and-class/518161</link>
    <description>I have had many people ask me this question, What is the difference between the attributes id and class? Well, after answering this question so many times I have decided I will make a short tutorial explaining the difference, because there is one.


[b]ID&#39;s:[/b]

First off, ID&#39;s are unique. Each page should only have 1 unique ID (I mess this up alot but I&#39;m only human). For example:

[code]
&lt;div id=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
[/code]

We should ONLY use the div with the id attribute of wrapper once for each page. Why should we only use it once you ask? Well, browsers have a special functionality for the ID attribute. You can have a div with the id of post-1:

[code]
&lt;div id=&quot;post-1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
[/code]

and an anchor tag with the href attribute of #post-1:

[code]
&lt;a href=&quot;#post-1&quot;&gt;Post 1&lt;/a&gt;
[/code]

Clicking this link will take you to where ever that div is placed on that page. AKA why they need to be unique. :)

[b]Classes:[/b]

Classes [b]are not [/b]unique. You can use multiple elements with the attribute of class on the same page. Classes can also have multiple values on each element. For example:

[code]
&lt;div class=&quot;big head&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
[/code]

You may be thinking &quot;THATS INVALID! THERES A SPACE!&quot; well, your partly right if you want to call the div big-head, but if we want to call it big, and head, we could call the css:

[code]
.big {

}

.head {

}
[/code]

Hopefully you understand my poopy explaining skills! :)</description>
