    <description>I have this following question.

&quot;Ethanol [ C2H5OH] and gasoline [approximately 100% octane C8H18] are both used as fuel in cars. If gasoline sells for $0.60/L, what would the price of ethanol have to be in order to provide the same amount of heat per dollar?
The density of octane is 0.7025g/ml, and heat of formation at STP for octane is -249.9 kJ/Mol. The density of Ethanol is 0.7894g/Mol and heat of formation at STP is -277.6 KJ/Mol&quot;

If you can help me with this i would really appreciate it. thank you.</description>

              <p>Use Dimensional Analysis.</p>
<p>I’ll show you how in the other way anyway:<br>
Work out the Molar masses of Both Ethanol and Octane.<br>
Using the density of octane work out how many g you’ll get per litre, then work out the cost in $/mol then work out the Heat of formation thing like, kJ/$ then remember it’ll have to equal the same as Ethonal, work backwards etc</p>
<p>Get it?</p>
