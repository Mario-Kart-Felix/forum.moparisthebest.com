    <title>Whats up with the run client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whats-up-with-the-run-client/401903</link>
    <description>Everytime someone with a windows 7 and a more up to date windows vista tries to run the client, the client can&#39;t find the &quot;java&quot;, I&#39;ve told them to download the recent version of java, so they do.... This still doesn&#39;t work...
Here is the run code:
@echo off
java -cp bin;lib/clientlibs.jar client 0 live english game0
pause

I am using a 562 loading a 562. 
Everyone with a older version of windows vista and a windows xp can use the server.
Could someone please tell me what&#39;s wrong and/or give me the code for a 64-bit client. 
Thank you.</description>
