    <description>Alright, here is my issue.

I have added skillcapes correctly to my server, got the skillcape emote button working but when I preform the emote, it turns out being ice barrage instead.

Then after looking for correct animations and gfx&#39;s, unsuccessful.

Then I realized that I had to add the correct animations and gfx&#39;s to the client. Found a few tutorials but nothing.

If there is a tutorial I am unaware of or if you can help me yourself, I would appreciate it if you can provide me with what I need. :)



EDIT:
Lol, guess when it comes to skillcapes, nobody knows. XD</description>
