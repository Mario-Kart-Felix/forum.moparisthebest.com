    <title>Lost finale</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lost-finale/341235</link>
    <description>Did anyone understand what happened?

How I interpreted it was that the dimension when they were actually dead and in whatever place they were, was actually in the future after they had all died, since clearly they were still alive at the series finale. Furthermore, when Ben and Hurley meet in this afterlife dimension, they said they both made a good team (as number one (ie. the &quot;Jacob&quot; of the island was Hurley) and as number two (Ben)), and that period elapsed only after the finale. However, the problematic fact with this is that they were all awaiting for Jack to arrive, meaning that he was the last to die, yet in the other dimension you see him die while the plane is leaving the island, so many actually continue to live after him.

Regardless, what did Jack&#39;s dad, Christian Shephard, actually mean when he said they had created that place for them to continue living? WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED

And I&#39;m extremely pissed as they answered no relevant questions pertaining to Jacob&#39;s brother nor mother.</description>

              <p>I know this ended last month and left alot of unsolved questions…</p>
<p>I had a theory that they all died when the plane crashed on Season 1 episode 1 because how the hell could anyone survive a plane crash that cracked the plane in half but yah they did slide… when it cracked in half so whatever.</p>
<p>I also pictured if they all died in s1e1 that the others were all made up from their imagination. Thats why Benjamin in the end didn’t want to enter the church because he didn’t exist.<br>
Also explains why you don’t see the chinese guy in the church.<br>
Also the chinese guy had the ability to talk to ghosts and Hurley has the ability to see dead people because these people were already a bit aware of them being dead but still not ready to move on. So they make up all these scenario to solve as a group to get ready to move on and thats how i see the whole show… Because even his father said “no one does it alone”.</p>
<p>Also explains why Herley won 150$? million dollars because he if you read his character doesn’t have much of a imagination so just goes for winning alot of money but his subconscious mind fears having alot of money will cause bad luck and misfortune and it manifests</p>
<p>Also explains that the black smoke is like a forcing system put in place to make sure people move on by forcing them to die in their own imagination so they can understand its time to go.</p>
<p>Also explains why a island is moving without using any bullshit like time traveling island that the whole island is made up… and everyone was ready to go back home… and they did only to find out they didn’t belong because they just made it all up living in a fake real world again… and went back to the island to attempt to die… which is why they set of that nuclear bomb.</p>
<p>This whole theory could fall apart when you see Desmond Hume living on the island because he wasn’t on the plane yet he joins them all @ the church so he must of been dead before the plane even crashed and looking for a party to hook up with so they could move on together.</p>
<p>Yah it could be interpreted a million different ways this is one of them that fits perfectly. Lots of stuff don’t add up though like the little nigga Walt had the ability to make dead birds come to life in one episode then he never uses his ability at all? But I think he revived the polar bears though so i guess thats okay and you just see him at s05 all grown up yet no point for him in the show what so ever? only the fact that hes used as a key to make Michael kill a few people and blow up the ship.</p>

<p>How did Lost turn into what it did. I only ever watched like… half of the first episode… i think.<br>
[/quote]The first three seasons were arguably the best seasons I’ve ever watched pertaining to any show. Then they introduced too much of the supernatural bullshit and it came to the point where it had the worst ending a show can possibly convey.[/quote]<br>
agreed they should have kept it fucking realistic, everyone thought it was somewhat realism show when they first watched it, then when the polar bear appeared on the island iwas like wtf, but dealt with it, watched the first season fully, skipped through a little of the 2nd and then all of a sudden u got a whole group of people with houses and shit living on the island, fucking warping of the island in time, and i quit at about the point the ‘smoke monster’ was introduced.</p>
<p>i did later on go back and watch it all, just because i like to finish something i start (even if it turned to shit) and yes, it turned to shit.</p>

</aside>
<p>No, in that last scene they were both dead because ‘years’ had passed while Ben and Hurley ran the island. They could make a spin-off about those years but everyone in that church of the final scene was undoubtedly dead. The big white light, numerous religious symbols, blah blah. The people who took off in the plane survived but died sometime later, which is why Kate had missed Jack so much.</p>
<p>The creators made this finale for the characters’ story-lines to conclude. The island remains mysterious as always. However they’ve said the DVD will have bonus footage + some other questions answered.</p>

              <p>You guys are idiots. That whole sideways flash is only experienced by Jack. You can tell through the dialogue with his father; his father explains that not everyone there is dead and that it isn’t actually happening, he goes on to explain how this experience is to comfort himself and help him let go.</p>

And coming up with a theory to explain all of the plot holes and stupidity doesn’t make you brighter than someone else – it means you’ve wasted time on a shit series that should have been aborted at conception.[/quote]I agree that the supernatural concept of the island was way overboard, but I was quite impressed with the fact that it seems that the director had the plot planned out for the whole series since season one,  because around 2-3 episodes ago, they explain something you see in season one and never understood.</p>
