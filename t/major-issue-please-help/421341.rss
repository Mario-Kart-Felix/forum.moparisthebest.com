    <title>MAJOR ISSUE! Please help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/major-issue-please-help/421341</link>
    <description>Hi guys, im having some major issues with my duel arena. (Using InsidiaX which is PI) and the challenge and all the before phases of the dueling works great, but after the duel is where the problems are. The winner is not teleported out of the duel arena after killing the other player, and the reward screen does not appear right away, and im pretty sure it either takes a long time to appear, or only appears after the other player logs out. Also, the player who loses the duel cannot teleport afterwards, as it says that they are still in a duel. If anyone can help me it would be awesome. I do have a teamviewer or msn / skype. Thanks</description>
