    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-does-it-take-to-have-a-successful-server/406063</link>
    <description>Im so confused...

I have done/coded so much for my server yet NO ONE plays...
I have had maybe like 6 people online MAX. 
I advertise most likely everyone on top sites/webclient maker sites..
I have purchased a VPS to hosting source on.
&#39;I have purchased custom domain..
I coded the server really good and developed the webclient..

I Just dont understand, Can someone explain to me how..? Im very confused and frustrated.</description>

              <p>Perhaps try making your own mini games .<br>
Keep practicing your coding perhaps(even though you bought the vps maybe you should have waited haha)<br>
Try and make a vote 4 cash or something.<br>
Is your server easy to level and earn cash…or is it harder(I would assume easy if its a pk server)</p>

Is there any more advice you guys can give me?</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/thanks">@Thanks</a><br>
Well let me ask you this…are you doing a revision that is popular?<br>
Uhmm ALOT of People Enjoy the OldSkool Pk Servers, So thats what I developed. Its like Semi-OldSkool</p>
<p>What makes your server stand out?<br>
To be honest… Nothing, All of It I have seen before, But How can I make it Unique when I myself arent a pro coder…</p>
<p>What great features do you have?<br>
I added a Gambling System, Vote Points for a Chest, Also I edited/added alot of scripts that I ripped from other great sources.<br>
What makes your server better then others?<br>
Jesus, I cant answer this one…<br>
Do you ask the people that play to advertise for you?<br>
Yes I do, Just never seems to work.<br>
Do you have a vote button link so people can vote for you on differen’t sites so others can see it?<br>
Indeed I do <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Starting a server is not easy at all. You need a LOT of patience. Once you get a good 10+ on regularly, it steadily rises from there, if you do everything right.</p>
