    <title>Looking for 317 PI Coder</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-317-pi-coder/453545</link>
    <description>I have a website, and a VPS. All I am looking for to start my community is a programmer that can code in-game so that we can drop our server. I need someone who can program almost every aspect of PI, like add minigames, and stuff like that. If you are interested in joining my project PM me or

msn- chrisrox6@hotmail.com

I have a very nice website with a full forums, and pretty much a base PI. Looking for someone who can make it a nice source so we can put it online! Like add minigames, areas, maps, chars, items, things that like.</description>

Well first of all this isn’t the right section to request a coder. There is a board called server development and there is a sub-board called development teams. Second I suggest you learn to code yourself. That way you will enjoy your server a lot more.</p>
