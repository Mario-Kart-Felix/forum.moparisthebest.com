    <title>Does your success come from school?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-your-success-come-from-school/330896</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve posted this on Moparscape, but Fat_Cookies suggested I try this discussion as well as a few others on Moparisthebest. I figured I&#39;d get better responses as well, so...

School is a source of education. But, not everyone pursues the rest of their life based on what they learn in their classes. To some people, the classes they&#39;ve taken in school were just as valuable as lunch.

Do you believe your grade in school defines how intelligent you are? Does it truly affect your future and opportunity toward success, or is it only a stepping stone in the right path?

              <p>I think the problem with school is they’re to attached, they won’t let you try new things, it’s always the basics. doing things like programming at home is better i believe rather than doing the VERY basics at school for 5 thousand years. They should let you develop at a standard you think you’re at, not force you to learn something you’ve done over and over.</p>

<p>Good grades is  the same as being smart. Some people in my class are plain stupid but good grades because they work their ass off. And some people like me get good grades and don’t really do anything to get it.</p>
<p>Much of the school is bullshit for me, I forget most things in less than a year.</p>

<p>School can help, It’s an important part of growing up in my opinion, it teaches you somewhat respect for others and how people behave in certain situations. Sometimes it can be bad, I.e. fights, bullying but it can be good life experience when you experience what it’s like and what you can do. School may not teach you as much knowledge to become a programmer or anything like that, but it teaches you the basics and how you should behave to be accepted as a member of the community.</p>

<p>I think high school is more important for general education than for specific education. It kind of teaches you what is right and wrong.</p>

              <p><span class="bbcode-b">Does your success come from school?</span><br>
It depends on what you consider ‘success’. In my sense, partially - I view success as understanding and knowing as much as possible, however not just in a scholastic sense, also in a person-to-person sense. My class in epistemology as well as ones that build analytical and critical thinking skills certainly have helped me, but social experiences with others also plays a major role. Although, I would not have had many of these experiences if not for school, however that is the social aspect and I wouldn’t consider that under school’s education.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Do you believe your grade in school defines how intelligent you are?</span><br>
I do not believe this to be true. Grades are affected by multitudes of internal and external influences - the difficulty of your classes, your mental condition, your physical condition to an extent, your desire/effort, and the teacher and source material you are given. This is partially why I abhor the American educational system, however I understand that ‘success’ is most likely different to a capitalist looking for employees compared to my definition of it.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Does it truly affect your future and opportunity toward success, or is it only a stepping stone in the right path?</span><br>
Again, it depends on what you consider ‘success’. It may affect your future, but like grades, there are always internal and external influences that can take prevalence.</p>

School is a practice of “learning how to learn”. The establishing of study techniques, increasing your ability of understanding. If you were to put 16 year old deprived of an education in a simulation that required a decent amount of problem solving along with a 16 year old that has completed his expected amount of years in school, the educated 16 year old would potentially solve it quicker and or better. Be it any subject given to the two of them, the educated 16 year old has gone ~10 years of school functioning on a slate that has required consistency and efficiency giving him the upper hand in the scenario. Without any guidelines or format, it’s difficult to solve something that requires specifications that one cannot fathom.</p>

<p>Discuss.[/quote]</p>
<p>It really does not define how intelligent you are. I see intelligence and knowledge as two separate things. Intelligence allows you to gain knowledge. Knowledge means the things you know. Someone with a lot of knowledge is someone who is a replacement for a (small) library. Someone who is intelligent is someone that can create a new library.</p>
<p>Knowledge is theory, intelligence is the ability to create new theory.</p>

<p>To expand on that, I would say the things my parents (who I would consider to be very intelligent), particularly my father, have taught me have had a far greater value than anything I’ve learned in school.[/quote]I concur with the small addition that is really depends on your level of education. Anything from pre-school up to college is completely useless for me because it is all either common sense or things i have had an ongoing interest in.</p>
