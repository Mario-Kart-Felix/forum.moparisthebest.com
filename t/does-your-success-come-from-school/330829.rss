    <title>Does your success come from school?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-your-success-come-from-school/330829</link>
    <description>School is a source of education. But, not everyone pursues the rest of their life based on what they learn in their classes. To some people, the classes they&#39;ve taken in school were just as valuable as lunch. 

Do you believe your grade in school defines how intelligent you are? Does it truly affect your future and opportunity toward success, or is it only a stepping stone in the right path?

I have a very low score in English 11 yet on my mid year I got a 90% on it. On the other hand my sister she had a good grade in the class like a 80-90, she got a 60-70% on her mid year. Also when we had our in class interviews for a job we picked in the 7th grade I got a 90% she got a 70% and I failed half the year in that. So no your success doesn’t always come from school.</p>

Grades really do NOT depend on how smart you are. A lot of it comes from creativity and the amount of effort you put into things. Some are the reason they are for non-academic reasons. For example, my English teacher had us bring in a notebook and it was an assignment worth 45 points. I didn’t and you can imagine what it did to my grade.</p>

<p>But… School isn’t only a source of education. In fact, it can probably be seen more as a valuable experience; gaining friends, seeing how the ‘real’ world works, even though we see little of it, etc.</p>

<p>Do you believe your grade in school defines how intelligent you are? Does it truly affect your future and opportunity toward success, or is it only a stepping stone in the right path?</p>
<p>Discuss.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Up to a certain point in your school life, your classes may not be of any worth to you, however, when you turn 14/15 you can choose the subjects you want to take, which is part of pursuing what path you want to follow in life. On top of this, in the UK most jobs nowadays require 5+ GCSEs A*-C (Which must include English &amp; Mathematics), so this part of life is compulsory if you’re wanting to get a half decent job if you don’t wish to pursue any further education beyond this point.</p>
<p>For example, when I was 14/15 I chose the following four GCSEs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Triple Science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics).</li>
<li>Business Studies.</li>
<li>I.C.T.</li>
<li>Geography.</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of those I had to continue with the compulsory classes such as Mathematics, Physical Education (P.E), Religious Education etc. The only GCSE choice I regretted taking is Geography; the teacher I had hated me and the feeling was mutual, therefore making that class hell for me. After the two year course I passed all four of the above subjects as well as the compulsory subjects (Excluding Religious Education; I failed that miserably :P).</p>
<p>To be honest, you don’t really need any qualifications if you’re not going to be working for anyone else (i.e. creating your own business/company), but it’s highly unlikely that you would get very far without basic qualifications such as the ones stated above (5 GCSEs A*-C). I mean if you were to create the next best invention or food product, then you’d be rich for life and wouldn’t need to pursue any further education (unless you felt the need to).</p>
<p>Though, some people may not think that success is all about their wealth and education; some people believe that success is having a happy family or something along those lines.[/quote]</p>
<p>I chose Geography, IMT and History.</p>

Grades are <span class="bbcode-b">voluntary</span> proof of the work you want to show to colleges. They are their for proof that you understand enough to reach a certain requirement. College is voluntary, as they look at what you’ve shown for your intelligence via GPA, SAT, ACT, and so on.

<p>[quote=“casey., post:31, topic:330829”]He’s a genius in his field of comedy. Obviously genius can cover an array of things.[/quote]Oh, I didn’t know you were insinuating that. I just saw the link you made to Bill Gates and being a genius. There is nothing preventing someone with determination from becoming equally skilled, if not better, in a roll in society. Of course there are handicaps that make things more difficult, and positions that are more demanding than others, but it doesn’t mean you’re eliminated from a future of success. There are so many ways to become successful, that it’s almost ignorant to assume the only reason they are successful is because they’re geniuses.</p>

<p>Just so everybody is clear, Bill Gates was not the only original founder of Microsoft. We give him more credit than he actually deserves.</p>
<p>“a group at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) developed the Alto, a GUI-based computer”<br>
This meaning - The main chunk of Microsoft and apple as we know it, they did not even invent, they simply re-created.<br>

<p>“they bought DOS from some guy who wrote it in his garage, made a few small changes, and sold it to IBM”<br>
This meaning - The original Microsoft, was never invented by Gates at all, but simply was bought because he had the money.<br>

<p>“Microsoft was started in 1975 and Apple in 1976. They worked together on a BASIC programming language called AppleSoft BASIC - the name being a combination of Apple and Microsoft for the Apple computer”<br>

<p>Bill Gates isn’t such a genius after all now is he? Yes, he is smart, but we do give him more credit than what he has earned. The basis to what we know as Windows was not even his to begin with, yet we say it as though.</p>
<p>Sorry for going off-topic, just clearing some up about this. It drives me crazy when people use him as an example when someone else could have been chosen who deserves it.</p>

Within the journey to success, there are milestones that require capability or expectations. There are a number of ways to perceiving these expectations, and in the end it doesn’t matter what you use to accomplish them but rather how you accomplish them. The amount of input within the path to success will no doubt determine the amount of success you receive. The concentration that your “following” supports is essential as to what your capable of accomplishing. It’s all about making the right decisions, pushing the right buttons, and swaying your peers into boosting your chances, because it’s nearly impossible to fully accomplish anything alone.</p>

If your smart but don’t apply yourself and get a bad GPA, than your not getting into a good college.<br>
If your smart and apply yourself, congratulations, you’re going to a great college.<br>

<p>“Bill Gates started studying at Harvard University in 1973 where he spent time with Paul Allen. Gates and Allen worked on a version of the programming language BASIC, that was the basis for the MITS Altair (the first microcomputer available). He did not go on to graduate from Harvard University as he left in his junior year to start what was to become the largest computer software company in the world; Microsoft Corporation.”</p>
<p>Bill Gates finished with a Sans degree, hardly what he was capable of. Though, you could still support the fact that it expresses exponential proof in “college requirement”. I’d suggest you look at this:</p>

<p>[quote=" story of George Eastman"]<img src="http://tinypic.com/r/2s82ohf/6" alt width="" height=""><br>
Creator of the Kodak Camera Company, George Eastman, was forced to drop out of school due to financial circumstances. At only 14, his father died and the only way George could keep his two sisters and mother alive was to quit school and begin working as an office boy full time. By the age of 26, Eastman found his true calling and began working to improve the emulsion process involved in photography. He thought the liquid emulsions proved quite a problem as they were excessively sticky and had to be used quickly before they dried. In only three years, Eastman had perfected his dry emulsion plates and he started his own photographic business in 1880.[/quote]</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>And if there isn’t promise in such things listed above, following a path in the arts is a potentially great way to becoming successful. Take Richard Prior for example:</p>
<p>[quote=" Richard Prior Story"]<img src="http://tinypic.com/r/s2a695/6" alt width="" height=""><br>
He was raised in his grandmother’s brothel, where his mother “worked” and his father served as her pimp. At only ten, his mother abandoned him and his strict grandmother took over his care, beating him whenever she thought he was acting “eccentric.” With a home life like this, it’s not all to surprising that he ended up being expelled from high school at 14.</p>
<p>In the end, Pryor ended up proving the adage that “whatever doesn’t kill you only makes you stronger” and his comedy career was one of the longest lasting and most successful of the last fifty years.[/quote]</p>
<p>Richard Prior has been introduced as the best comedian numerous amounts of times;</p>

<p>There’s also a larger list of persona that come from various different backgrounds, listing a multitude of career positions:</p>

<p>If this isn’t enough to curve your insistence on a degree, I don’t know how else to entice your opinion. Though, everyone has their own, I’m only here to strike up a decent discussion, as I’m tired of talking about the same trivial matters on moparscape.</p>

Eeh, i would definatelly say my does not come from school, or parents. My parents are both 9th grade drop-outs. As for school, i go to an alternative school. Not the funnest thing, but i dont do good with 30-40+ people in a classroom, thats why the college im looking at is 28 classroom.<br>

Times have changed since when your parents were kids.<br>
A college degree wasn’t as important in our parents teenage years as it is now.[/quote]Time’s <span class="bbcode-i">have</span> changed, and that could be your counter-argument to what I’ve posted, but that doesn’t stand in front of the success rate of radical dropouts. One could say there’s no honest way to determine your chance at success after denying the opportunity at a diploma, but for the sake of discussion there’s nearly an infinite opening to potential success without one.</p>

              <p>Eeh, i would definatelly say my does not come from school, or parents. My parents are both 9th grade drop-outs. As for school, i go to an alternative school. Not the funnest thing, but i dont do good with 30-40+ people in a classroom, thats why the college im looking at is 28 classroom.</p>
