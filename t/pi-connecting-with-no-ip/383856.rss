    <title>[PI]Connecting with NO-IP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-connecting-with-no-ip/383856</link>
    <description>I have successfully hosted servers before but it has been a while and I am having issues. I have set up my no-ip and have the .duc running and my server running. When I try to connect to it using my no-ip ( doing so by changing things in client.java) I can not connect. However I can connect if I use my local ip, and can connect with my other computer using my IPV4 ( or what ever it is) Any ideas on what I am doing wrong? Thanks. ( note I have portfowarded, but that has nothing to do with it as I am trying to connect from my own computer) Thanks guys.</description>

<p>Check your port, make sure it is open. You might not have port fowarded correctly.</p>

<p>I was never able to connect to my own server using my no-ip while on the same computer. I always had to use Localhost or 127.0.0.1 I don’t know the reason exactly why, all I know is you can’t do it. Why would you want to connect using your no-ip anyways?</p>

<p>I have been able to do it in the past. I have a friend who can’t connect with it either, so I want to make sure I can even connect before he starts trying again :p.</p>

<p>I was able to connect using my no-ip o.o<br>
The way I solved this was playing a bit with my no-ip settings</p>
