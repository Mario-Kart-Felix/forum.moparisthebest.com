    <title>MoparCraft FTB Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparcraft-ftb-server/520162</link>
    <description>I&#39;m glad to notify everyone that the community FTB server is now operational! We have the very basics, no edits to the actual modded gameplay aside from a user authentication plugin which requires you to register. We&#39;re using the FTB Ultimate pack, right now it isnt linked to the main game at all or the forum so if you want your username you&#39;re going to have to register quickly.

You can register by doing,

[code]/register password repeatpassword[/code]

And login by doing,

[code]/login password[/code]

We&#39;re currently working on reviewing the features of FTB which can be deemed server killing, right now everything is in there, this may change in the future. The rules are still basically the same, just use common sense and pay account to others and their work. If you&#39;re not sure on something ask a member of staff, if you have a report use the same board as you would for vanilla reports. Finally, onto the connection details:

[b]IP:[/b] FTB.moparcraft.net

We&#39;re using the most recent version of every mod, and the mindcrack modpack, so simply downloading the FTB launcher from here: http://feed-the-beast.com/#download_wrapper and connecting should be sufficient. Please be aware that FTB uses more system resources, and will most likely deliver a lower framerate on every system so you may have issues/need to reconfigure depending on your setup.

Right now if there are functioning cracked clients they are supported by the server, we have account checking disabled.

The current whitelist is:
