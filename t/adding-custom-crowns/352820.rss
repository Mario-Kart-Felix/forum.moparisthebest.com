    <title>Adding Custom Crowns</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-custom-crowns/352820</link>
    <description>Ok so I want to know how to add crowns for regular players, I&#39;m making a rank system and I want each rank to have a different thing. Sooo.... how would I do that, I have the sprites and just tell me what to add to the client and what to add to the following code.

[code]if (rank == 1) {
......................
}[/code]

TO BE SPECIFIC! I&#39;m making a 6 rank system on my server based off of total exp. I want it when you type ::players, to show (rank picture) (Name). That&#39;s it.</description>
