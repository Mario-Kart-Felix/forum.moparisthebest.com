    <title>Deciding on getting a 2010 mustang. (snowy roads)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/deciding-on-getting-a-2010-mustang-snowy-roads/377181</link>
    <description>Well i have the money for it and it&#39;s been my dream since i was 11 to get a ford mustang, although the downside is i live in michigan where in the winters the roads are icy :( and from doing some research online i found that the ford mustang isn&#39;t very snow capable.

Is there any snow-worthy sports cars you guys could suggest? or how would i match up on the snowy roads with my mustang?</description>

<p>Bit much on torque for those, I’ve seen 3 in the ditch in Michigan before I left. Not saying they are a bad one for snow, since they are AWD it should be fine.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span> - The Ford Mustang will not handle the snow very well at all. They have too much HP and torque and will spin the tires without even trying. When I left on the 6th to Mississippi (warm here btw :P), I had a front-wheel drive car and it spun alot. This year is a very icy year for Michigan. If you are wanting a sport car for snow I would suggest anything AWD, FWD, or even something with true-4. My personal fav is the Dodge Neon SRT4, but those will spin tires alot. Basically, don’t go RWD sports car unless you want to park it for the winter months.</p>
<p>Be sure to give whatever you buy a car wash weekly though, bunch of salt around <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

Front wheel drive is better in the snow/ice than rear wheel drive, hands down.  Obviously 4 wheel drive would be better than either.  Which is why I recommended the AWD Charger R/T (which has very close to the same performance as the awesome SRT-8, maybe even better acceleration due to the improved traction?).  A rear-wheel-drive car or truck in the winter is a nightmare, trust me as I’ve driven my share of them.<br>

<p>Your idea of a nightmare is my idea of having fucking fun.</p>
<p>p.s fuck the snowy roads and just get an elise[/quote]</p>
<p>I know what you mean, and doing a few donuts and such is fun.  It becomes a nightmare in quite a few situations though, I recall a time I was stuck on the downside of an ice-covered hill, and my 2wd truck had turned sideways, blocking the entire road, and my wheels would spin with no traction going forward or backward.  If ANYTHING came over the top of the hill, I’d be dead right now.  I ended up punching the gas and it turned around enough so I could put it in neutral and roll back down the road about a mile, then I took a running start at the hill and barely made it over the top.  Almost dying is not fun at all. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

I live off of some dirt roads, and stuff during the winter it’s more then just driving safe, i’ve known too many people that have gotten in accidents and died because of the snowy michigan roads, please do not speak of this unless you know from experience.</p>
<p>And it’s not like im driving a classic car, i could care less if it gets dirt and salt underneath it or not.</p>

<p>Yeah exactally what I am going to do some day. I don’t want to take my nice vehicle out during the winter and get all the salt and shit under the car fucking it up. I would rather just drive around a fucking beater, nobody cares what your car looks like in the winter anyway all cars are dirty with dirt and shit on them.</p>

<p>It’s 2TD (2 Track drive). Snow isn’t a problem at all, if there’s a lot of snow we can mount a modified snowplough to it. It does limit the view a bit, but hey: you’re in a tank, what can happen? It’s not like hitting pedestrians will put a dent in it.</p>

Almost every police car is RWD or AWD and in Missouri we use Crown Vics or we Impala’s… And they both are great in the snow, they have better control during the snow then FWD since your power is in the front your obviously gonna slide or wreck and lose control over it. So IMO get a RWD vehicle or a AWD don’t go with a shit FWD.</p>
<p>Like MITB said get a charger.[/quote]I’m going to reply to this before I read the other new comments.  You are a fucking idiot.  Please allow me to list the reasons why in a point form order so as to save space and prevent finger-cramping.</p>
<p>[ul][li]A 2-wheel drive truck will not go anywhere in snow.  An AWD will but that defeats your argument?[/li]<br>
[li]You mention how police interceptors are RWD or AWD.  Correct, usually, but anywhere with snowy conditions above a certain limit requires the vehicles to receive the full police interceptor upgrade including new stiffer suspension, a supercharged engine and hey…an AWD package!  You will never see a RWD interceptor in any town with a real winter.[/li]<br>
[li]This point could be long based on your retarded theory that FWD = slide + wreck due to loss of control.  When in fact FWD gives you MORE control than a RWD since your power is in the front…THE SAME PLACE YOU’RE PIVOTING ON.[/li]<br>
[li]The main reason RWD vehicles are used in sports like NASCAR is because a FWD setup eliminates most of the room that could be used for a transaxle.  Some drivers have requested a vehicle to be built to spec of a FWD for more control at high speeds (a rumor that RWD has).[/li]<br>
[li]Not really a point at all…more just pointing out your ignorance…but the impala has been front wheel drive for years and Ford has said they have no intentions of returning it to RWD in the future.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>God damn I hate retards.  Don’t respond.  You lost.</p>

<p>Ha I drove my grandfathers chevy silverado to school a couple days ago in snow and I was slipping around like a mother fucker before I noticed I wasnt in 4WD. Where I live ironically they use chargers (which alot of police use these days) and this spring I am getting on a ramp only to see a police office who was taking radder slipping around with his 2WD in a ditch (after it rained the previous night) trying to get out, to go fine somebody. So I am all for police driving 2WD when it means they get stuck in the ditch while I am speeding past them.</p>
<blockquote>Like MITB said get a charger.</blockquote>
[quote]Anyway, a perfect car for you, if you want a new one, would be to get a Dodge Charger R/T with [b]AWD[/b] (All wheel drive).  The R/T has something like 380 HP and 400 ft/lbs of torque, which, combined with [b]AWD[/b] means you can blow away any mustang/camaro/similar with it easily, and still get around in bad weather.  You can also get [b]AWD[/b] in the cheaper SXT model, but it's quite a bit slower.

              <p>Why would you say RWD is bad? Trucks= RWD they go fine with snow, 2W or 4W. Almost every police car is RWD or AWD and in Missouri we use Crown Vics or we Impala’s… And they both are great in the snow, they have better control during the snow then FWD since your power is in the front your obviously gonna slide or wreck and lose control over it. So IMO get a RWD vehicle or a AWD don’t go with a shit FWD.</p>
<p>Like MITB said get a charger.</p>
