    <title>Hey Guys i&#39;m having some trouble with DaNubScape client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hey-guys-im-having-some-trouble-with-danubscape-client/354266</link>
    <description>DanubScape client has been a very great source/server to start on, unfortuneitly, they have made there own little signatures on the client, the login screen instead of saying &quot;Runescape&quot; now has a picture of 4 differenlt logos say DaNubScape, same with the Inventory in the game, it says, Danub &amp; K0 Kingz own server. Now, Can someone please tell me how to change it to my own picture, and get rid of theres?</description>

<p>Spamming that you need help when people wont answer your question isn’t stupid? Posting in the wrong section without reading what the section is about isn’t stupid?</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>

              <p>5 of your 16 posts are asking the same question.</p>
<p>3 in RuneScape server help<br>
1 in RuneScape client help (this would be the correct one)<br>
1 in RuneScape [size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">classic</span></span>[/size] help.</p>
<p>If people haven’t respond to your cry for help in the RuneScape section, what makes you think people will want to help you in the RuneScape [size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">classic</span></span>[/size] section?</p>
<p>I know you want help, but don’t act stupid about it.</p>
