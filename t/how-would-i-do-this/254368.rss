    <title>How would I do this?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-would-i-do-this/254368</link>
    <description>My sister always spends a SHITLOAD of time talking to a bunch of her bitch friends at school, they really are bitches. So she gets on the computer and spends hours emailing them bitches. I want to know how I could make the browser redirect to a page that says yahoo or google mail is under maintenance. Ive made the page, I just need to know the method of doing this.</description>

              <p>yea, set your hosts file like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">127.0.0.1 .com</code></pre>
<p>will result in redireting all .com to localhost, just setup webserver on localhost then it will open that,<br>
repeat for all .net, .org, .co.uk and other pre-fixs</p>

<p>I need to know your sisters: name,age,cup size and msn.<br>
I will put this information into my script.<br>
This way my script will recognize your sister and will immediatly go to the “under maintenance” page.[/quote]</p>
<p>Cup size is really important i guess, dood you should just change her password and then she’ll go around and bitch about how she got hacked.</p>
