    <title>How would I do this?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-would-i-do-this/269915</link>
    <description>My friends and I are creating a server based on teh economy... People have to make the items and/or sell to other so that they can have armor ands items. But i found it in the testing that you cant smith! It only turns the bars into gold. So I was woundering if by any chance anyone can tell me how I can make a shop where I can exchange bars (bronze bars, addy bars, rune bars) to get the items if they where smithing. I was kinda thinking of the same way the pest control works. How you need points to get items. My server is a 317 server. if anyone can help me. I will give them free admin on my server once its released! Thank you!</description>
