    <description>Hey guys, im actually on my friends account who is the owner, and im really not a coder so please if you do have an answer, make it simple for me :). Recently, shes been updating the server a lot along with a bunch of new clients, and she recently came out with a new one that I have a problem with. I open up the client, and it says &quot;Cache cannot be downloaded - Retrying in (x) seconds&quot;. So I was wondering if anyone knew how to fix that? I also get an error in the cmd box.. Im pretty sure that has something to do with it.
