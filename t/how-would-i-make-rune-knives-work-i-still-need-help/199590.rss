    <description>[b]I WANT RUNE KNIVES TO DELETE AFTER I THROW THEM[/b]

Ok so I have them farcasting, but It doesnt delete the knives. If I have 10 it stays at 10 and keeps throwing them. And how do I apply the gfx on the victim I hit? thats how my server deletes arrows.
[code]    /* RANGE*/
    public boolean HasArrows = false;
    public void DeleteArrow() {
        if (playerEquipmentN[playerArrows] == 0) {
            deleteequiment(playerEquipment[playerArrows], playerArrows);
        }
        if (playerEquipment[playerWeapon] != 4214
                &amp;&amp; playerEquipmentN[playerArrows] != 0) {
            outStream.createFrameVarSizeWord(34);
            outStream.writeWord(1688);
            outStream.writeByte(playerArrows);
            outStream.writeWord(playerEquipment[playerArrows] + 1);
            if (playerEquipmentN[playerArrows] - 1 &gt; 254) {
                outStream.writeByte(255);
                outStream.writeDWord(playerEquipmentN[playerArrows] - 1);
            } else {
                outStream.writeByte(playerEquipmentN[playerArrows] - 1); // amount	
            }
            outStream.endFrameVarSizeWord();
            playerEquipmentN[playerArrows] -= 1;
        }  
        updateRequired = true; 
        appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
    }

    public void CheckArrows() {
        for (int k = 880; k &lt; 893; k++) {

            if (playerEquipment[playerArrows] == k) {
                HasArrows = true; 
            } else if (playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 4214) {
                HasArrows = true;
            } else {
                HasArrows = false;
            }

        }
    }
[/code]
And I dont get it.
