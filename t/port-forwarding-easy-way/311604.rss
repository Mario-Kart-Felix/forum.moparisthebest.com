STEP 1
To start off you need to know your static IP address, if you know it already skip to step 2
1. Open up command prompt
2. Type in &quot;ipconfig&quot; and press enter and you should see something like this.(see below image)

STEP 2
1. Type that Ip address in at the top of your screen. Example   &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; &lt;----(please don&#39;t use that address its just the local host)
2. It should ask you for a user name and password. If you have not changed it the default user name and password are &quot;admin&quot;
3. When you get on the site go to the top and click on gameing
4. You will see something like this. (see below image)
5. Name the application &quot;RPSP&quot; (Runescape Private Server)
6. Set the Start and the End to 43594
7. Set the protocol to Both and enter in a number under the ip address from 5-99 (I recommend 98)
