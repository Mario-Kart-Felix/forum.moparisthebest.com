    <title>Making New Private Servers | Looking for Coders | Also Need Suggestions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-new-private-servers-looking-for-coders-also-need-suggestions/335622</link>
    <description>-I am making a official private server for a website called rsportal and im looking for some help. I need help on which name i should make it, what type of server, and what to have on it. I spent over 50 bucks already to set things up but the coders just left because they said they wanted to own it. I offered them co-owner but as he is a mod in the forums he acts all cocky and threatens to ban me which i got him demoted. Now im looking for serious people to help.

-new team members will need to post their skills

With that in mind, I have decided to start creating a new, well designed server.

Who we are looking for

At the moment, we need (quite obviously) more programmers. Although someone with molding experience would be especially nice, I know that being that strict I won&#39;t find anyone.


What you get

A great pay and more.
Of course, we are a team, so you will get credits for what you do as well.


- WILLINGNESS TO LEARN, and to become a good programmer.

- ABILITY TO FOLLOW my advice / RuneEmu design.

- Passing ONE of the following tests:
   




Contact me

msn: admin@iportal317.com


About me

I was known on rsbot for the best hacker and ever had it verified by admins. I single handed went by every p server site and hacked others sites not for bad reasons but to help them fix their security. i made over 7k in a month by helping many people.

The Current Team

-Me (Buying the domain and Hosting)

<p>That means nothing, you can hack without having good grammar.</p>
<p>Also this should be in the Team development since your asking for a team and showing this off as a team.</p>
