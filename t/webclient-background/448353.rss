    <title>Webclient Background</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-background/448353</link>
    <description>I&#39;m going to need something large and fascinating, I&#39;d rather most of the colors to be a cyan blue or deep blue color...
This is going to be fore my web-client background, And truthfully who wants to see a pitch black background?
The server name is &quot;DreamScape&quot;
Try to mainly stick with the color blue... If you wish to add another color such as red.. make it go along with the background...
I will speak good of you.. And Ill be glad to see the designs everyone makes.. :D
Sincerely, Trade me

EDIT:
I went through all the other posts in this section, And I now see that you guys are pretty specific on what your doing...
To make your job easier.. Ill help you..
I&#39;d like a deep blue background, with cyan blue smoke coming from several directions
SMOKE EXAMPLE: http://images2.layoutsparks.com/1/171283/blue-smoke-aqua-green.jpg
NO, I don&#39;t want the smoke copy and pasted, and no I don&#39;t want the smoke exactly there...
I want it coming from various direction.. Surprise me...
Id also like a wizard or skeleton or a wizard skeleton holding a crystal ball in one of his hands..
Make sure to put most off this away from the center of the screen as the web-client would be covering it...
Also add players pking.. and add it somewhat shaded under the blue.. 

Lol, I dont know really, Thats about as specific as I can get...</description>
