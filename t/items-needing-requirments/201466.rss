    <description>Ok well over my 1-2 months of coding,i&#39;ve become a pretty decent coder...i&#39;ve been adding,removing,and fixing things on my server,and LEARNING ALOT from reading tut&#39;s and figuring things out on my own,i just recently took notice to some items on my server,people can wear like fighter torsos,rune defenders ect..without the stats to wear them...probably a REALLY stupid question to be asking but,i was wondering if anyone could tell me how to change/add stat requirments for items,any help would be greatly appericated.</description>
