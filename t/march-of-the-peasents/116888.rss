    <title>March Of The Peasents</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/march-of-the-peasents/116888</link>
    <description>I am working on a Machinima called March of The Peasents.. For those who don&#39;t know what a Machinima is: [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinima]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinima[/url].

I am planning on using a private server for most of the filming, and maybe use clips from a few other games.

Anyway, I need some help. I am completely new to this kind of thing, and have no idea how to get on a server that includes other people besides myself. 

I need to know a good server to use. The only requirements I have are the ability to change clothes, hairdo, etc, and the ability to spawn items. Teleporting would be nice too. I would just use regular Moparscape, changing clothes (by talking to the lady) and changing other things will not work. I can&#39;t even talk to NPCs for some reason. 

I&#39;m sorry if I am posting this in the wrong place, I have spent hours browsing over the Moparscape forums, and can&#39;t find a more appropriate place to put this.

If you would like to do any acting in my Machinima, that would be good too. I need a few actors, because I can only be on one account at once (I believe.)

-Thanks.</description>

Yes, that would be helpful. I can’t work on it right now, because I can’t seem to figure out a server to use.</p>
