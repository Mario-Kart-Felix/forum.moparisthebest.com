    <title>Need Help with Clanwars</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-clanwars/202369</link>
    <description>Allright, So I&#39;m working on making my clanwars a safe zone (players die, and are just teleported back to the recruitment room, rather than being teleported home and losing all of their items)

 My problem : I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve got it down to if &quot;inclanwar = true&quot;, then it should teleport them upon death without them losing items.

 However, I&#39;ve made it so that when a player enters the clanwar portal, &quot;inclanwar&quot; becomes true, and they are set to a team. (If this is wrong, please correct me)

 The Compiling problem...

client.java:1733: not a statement
clan == 1;
     ^
client.java:1743: not a statement
inclanwar == true;
          ^
client.java:1755: not a statement
clan == 2;
     ^
3 errors
Press any key to continue . . .


Any help is appreciated, Thanks very much, Zithro.</description>

              <p>these are not supported in javascript thats why they say not a statement.<br>
What you need is to delete them and then add a new boolean applydead1() or something and take away the youdied() statement.</p>
