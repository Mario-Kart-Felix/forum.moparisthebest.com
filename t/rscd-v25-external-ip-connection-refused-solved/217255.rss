    <title>RSCD v25 external IP connection refused[solved]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rscd-v25-external-ip-connection-refused-solved/217255</link>
    <description>I have set up the RSCD v25 server and client so that the client can connect using both localhost and my internal IP. Everything works that way but when the client is set to my external IP, the connections are refused. I have forwarded the ports for the listening server port, world server port, and query port. I have set up T X&#39;s Basic Server v2 and did not run into this problem with it which makes me wonder if there is some sort of childish leech protection going on.

When I replace the working internal IP with my external IP in world.xml and launch both the listening server and the game server, the listening server connects to the database okay but in the game server window I receive this message:

I have forwarded every port on my Linksys router to my 192.168.1.104 internal IP and disabled all filtering. All firewalls are disabled. I am running Vista 64 which supports IPv6. When I searched for &quot;java.net.BindException: Cannot assign requested address: bind&quot; in Google, results came up talking about an incompatibility with IPv6 IP addresses. I only have IPv4 IP addresses so this should not cause any problems.

I am completely stumped and it has been two days and two nights of trying to solve this problem. Others have been able to run RSCD v25 servers for external users (other than running localhost only) so what is the issue?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: July 03, 2008, 10:04:00 PM[/size][hr]problem solved - I was trying to connect to a server running on the same machine using my external IP which normally works. When I connected to my dedicated PC using the external IP - it worked!</description>
