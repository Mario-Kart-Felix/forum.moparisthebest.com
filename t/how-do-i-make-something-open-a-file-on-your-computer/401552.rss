    <title>How do I make something open a file on your computer?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-make-something-open-a-file-on-your-computer/401552</link>
    <description>Title says it, basically...

So, I&#39;m trying to make a CPanel or something, just sorta messing around and trying to learn, but how do I make a button, say, jStartServ, open a file on my C:\ drive? Like, in VisualBasic you can use the Shell(); command, or the Process.start();, but what do I put in to open a program/folder in Java?

I&#39;ve looked everywhere, and all I can find is how to open a new Frame, which doesn&#39;t help me:|</description>
