    <title>RSC status page</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsc-status-page/445576</link>
    <description>I have created a place where you can advertise your very own or your most wanted RSC server.
This site is based on MoparScape Status checker. It is his own script code and of course 90% credits goes to Moparisthebest. 
on time I hope that page will make  money, I also would like to expand that page to other kind servers.
But now you&#39;re free to add your very own RSC server and see it grow on my RSC server status page.

Well since you have read everything I think you are want to see the page at its current stage.

Please note that as it is now you have to register a account to be able to Post/vote and add a new server, that might change in time.

Thank you MoparIsTheBest and myself for editing and making this possible.
Before I forget some links and pictures may not work but in less than 24 hours they will.</description>
