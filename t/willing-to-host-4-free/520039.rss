    <title>Willing to host 4 FREE!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/willing-to-host-4-free/520039</link>
    <description>Hello, my name is J Blaze, I live in canada hahah not thant you care, Anyway I am willing to host a RSPS for anyone who needs it. I am actually willing to give up my server that has 1 player on it, To make a greater one with someone else. I have a great PC that is running 24/7 No lag, I can code. (that&#39;s a bonus) I have a lot of Exp in making servers, If you need a webclient for the server, I can do that as well. Please don&#39;t bother paying me, Just let me play on the server, And have fun. 

Hoping to have at least: All Bosses, All Minigames, Most skills, Eco Friendly, And most of all FUN. So if you need any help with it, I am Portforward Ready, Just need A Source And Client. 

Some of you are thinking like, &quot;Why don&#39;t you just make your own server?&quot;
Well the thing is, I made my own server, Had it up for a bit and had maximum of 6 players.
I want to go big, That&#39;s been my dream. Lol. So you know what to do ! What are you waiting for?! Fun is right around the corner!</description>
