              <p>Hi, this section is for talking about current games. You may not advertise your clan for a game, as that’s not what this section is intended for.</p>
<p>Feel free to discus the game, and then invite people to your clan if they show an interest. Also, feel free to advertise your clan in your signature, however you can’t do it in this post.</p>
