    <title>Error, need to know where this goes;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-need-to-know-where-this-goes/119439</link>
    <description>I keep getting this error every now and again in runserver.bat even with 1 user on -.-&#39;

[code]
Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String ind
ex out of range: 1
at java.lang.String.getChars(Unknown Source)
at java.io.BufferedWriter.write(Unknown Source)
at client.savechar(client.java:23364)
at client.process(client.java:11234)
at PlayerHandler.process(PlayerHandler.java:137)
at server.main(server.java:50)
[/code]

I then read a thread on a site and someone said this;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At a guess the last line in the file is a blank line and the returned string is either zero or one character long. Add something like:

[code]
while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
    if( line.length &lt; 74 ) {   // or whatever the max length of a line is
        System.err.println( &quot;read a line that was too short&quot; );
        continue;
    }
[/code]

Maybe you don&#39;t need to print an error - I don&#39;t know what your requirements are. But either way you should verify that you got enough data before trying to do the substring().&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Where would i add that?[br][size=1]Posted on: July 03, 2007, 10:57:47 AM[/size][hr]Please i [b][u]really[/b] need help.</description>
