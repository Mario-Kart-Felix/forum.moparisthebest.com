    <title>Reporting Reminder</title>

    <description>We are now near page 70 of green reports. Yes that is good, but there are a few things I would like to point out.


[center]The Report to Moderator button - Found in the bottom-right corner of every post: [img]http://i119.photobucket.com/albums/o129/daggerheart8/pic1.jpg[/img][/center]



To the members:
1. If someone reports the topic before you, please do not report it again. A mod is bound to get to it sooner or later, and spamming the reports will just create longer times to have a thread locked.

2. Do not report the same topic twice. As I said before, it just takes longer to fulfill. If two posts in one topic are breaking rules, report them BOTH. If the topic is only one page big, then you don&#39;t need to because we can usually catch it anyway.

3. When reporting, make sure you enter detail into the provided box similar to the one shown below. Any detail added is great, whether the note is spam, wrong section, etc. Please do not post a useless message such as &#39;s&#39;. Please do not leave the box blank. We will most likely not issue punishments for this, unless it is HIGHLY abused(spam).

Please make sure to review the forum TOS and rules. There is a sticky with them at the top of the announcement board.






To other moderators:

I felt that this would clean up reports a bit. Since globals and some other moderators usually don&#39;t check the report green, we wouldn&#39;t have to go through so many useless ones. (If you have the time...please check them green anyway).









Thanks, improvement on the reports will be greatly appreciated. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to message me or other moderators via private messaging.</description>
