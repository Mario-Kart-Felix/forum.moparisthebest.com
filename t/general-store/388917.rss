    <description>when i sell stuff to a general store it turns the thing i sold into dwarf remains  :confused:
does anyone know how i can fix? source is delta

fixed... umm well kidnda lol you cant sell noted items to the shop or it turns into dwarf remains and the shop dosent update unless you have dwarf remains in the shop so all i did was put dwarf remains in the store via shops.cfg the code is 0 and i put the amount to 0 

but if anyone knows how i can get shop to update without them in there or take noted items please post</description>
