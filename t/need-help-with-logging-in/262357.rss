    <description>Hey guys I am attempting to make models for my server. So to do this I needed a client with an ip changer..so i could change it to my ip. I tried using Fubergen&#39;s client, http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,345039.0.html

It loaded fine and everything seemed good. I typed my ip address in and when I tried to log in it just said error connecting to server. Yes I do have No-IP opened and runnning. If anybody could help me fix this problem or maybe suggest another 317 client that I could use...that&#39;d be great. Thanks ;)[br][br][size=1]Posted on: February 16, 2009, 07:54:42 am[/size][hr]Anyone go any idea??</description>
