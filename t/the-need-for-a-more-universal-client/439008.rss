    <title>The need for a more universal client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-need-for-a-more-universal-client/439008</link>
    <description>There are many servers and clients out there, and I find it a very difficult task to find a base which I can
work on without having premade subjective features which do not corrolate the original runescape design.

With the recent Jagex changes, many players are seeking refuge in private servers, and when I think private servers, I think moparscape.

The sad thing is, I could never really navigate this site, nor find any sources, nor reliable high-uptime servers. 

At the current moment, there is a need for a more universal runescape private server that is at least somewhat reliable enough for players to play instead of runescape.

Runescape is changing is a very drastic direction, and private servers have the upper hand in this matter. The question is -- why has no server pushed to gain attention of runescape players yet? Many players would switch in seconds.

Thanks!</description>

<p>essentially i think it just comes down to people,</p>
<ol>
<li>being to young to implement anything successfully</li>
<li>not wanting to spend the ammount of time that would be needed to write an even somewhat universal server/client.</li>
</ol>
<p>and even then people would just start releasing tutorials and messing it up, release “updated versions” under there own revision name and then the process would restart.</p>
