    <description>These are two tutorial I made when I was bored. I&#39;ve done all of these (of course) so feel free to comment/ask questions.



[B]Title:[/B] How To: Correctly Partition a Linux Box.
[B]Difficulty:[/B] 1/10
[B]Time:[/B] 5 Minutes or less.

[B]Intro:[/B]
A lot of new users idiotically use the entire disk as root (/). Well, this is incorrect due to the facts of: slow boot time, slow disk read speed, and lack of security. This guide will tell you how to correctly partition your disk to make the ultimate Linux machine.

[B]Tutorial:[/B]
Ok, first off we need a Distribution. I use Debian, but it is pretty much the same in all distro&#39;s. When you get to the part of the installation where you partition your hard drives ALWAYS select manual and use the follow configuration:

[CODE]
SIZE          FILESYSTEM     MOUNTPOINT
100MB           ext3                          /boot
4GB           (unformatted)              SWAP
40-60GB        ext3                         /
REST              ext3                         /home
[/CODE]

REST stands for the amount of diskspace left over from the partitioning, if you have less than 10GB of HDD space, don&#39;t do the last partition.

[B]Note:[/B] Some distributions need an input of cylinders rather than bytes - just grab a calculator!

Hope this helped!







[B]Title:[/B] How To: Correctly Setup RAID 5 in a Linux Box.
[B]Difficulty:[/B] 3/10
[B]Time:[/B] 10 Minutes setup, 1-3Hrs Initialization.

[B]Intro:[/B]
Many people want speed and redundancy, but don&#39;t know how to obtain it. RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) allows the user to mirror, stripe, or even both! This tutorial will show how to setup RAID 5 (Striping with Mirroring).

[B]Tutorial: [/B]
[B]Note:[/B] I HIGHLY DISCOURAGE RAIDing of a Boot disk (Aka the disk with the Linux OS on it). It makes it extremely complex, especially with this tutorial. 

First, install a Linux distribution on one disk and hook up 3 more disks to your motherboard. 

In this tutorial I will be using Debian and SATA HDDs.

RAID Formula: [CODE]f=(n-1)s[/CODE]
Where n is the number of drives and s is the size and f is the final array size.

[B]What RAID 5 is:[/B]
Striped set with distributed parity or interleave parity. Distributed parity requires all drives but one to be present to operate; drive failure requires replacement, but the array is not destroyed by a single drive failure. Upon drive failure, any subsequent reads can be calculated from the distributed parity such that the drive failure is masked from the end user. The array will have data loss in the event of a second drive failure and is vulnerable until the data that was on the failed drive is rebuilt onto a replacement drive.

Step 1:  (Installing a partition manager)
[CODE]sudo su[/CODE]
[CODE]apt-get install gparted[/CODE]

Step 2: (Partitioning)
In the Gnome Partition Editor, select each disk and format it to ext3. Once the format is complete, right click on each new volume you have created and select “Manage Flags” - check the ‘RAID’ flag to indicate the disk will become part of a RAID set.

Step 3: (Installing the RAID manager)
[CODE]apt-get install mdadm[/CODE]

Step 4: (RAIDing)
[CODE]sudo mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=5 --raid-devices=3 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1[/CODE]
[B]Note:[/B] Make SURE the listed devices (/dev/sdb1, etc) are the devices you just formatted and want to RAID.


[B][U]STOP![/U][/B]

Wait for the RAID to finish Initializing: [CODE]watch cat /proc/mdstat[/CODE]




Step 5: (Writing configuration)
[CODE]echo &quot;DEVICE partitions&quot; &gt; /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf[/CODE]
[CODE]mdadm --detail --scan &gt;&gt; /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf[/CODE]

Step 6: (Formating the RAID)
[CODE]mke2fs -j /dev/md0[/CODE]

Step 7: (Adding to auto-mount list.)
[CODE]nano /etc/fstab[/CODE]
Add this at the bottom of the mounts:
[CODE]/dev/md0 /array0 auto defaults 0 3[/CODE]

Step 8: (Make the directory to mount it)
[CODE]cd /[/CODE]
[CODE]mkdir array0[/CODE]


Now REBOOT.

Step 9: (Setting permissions)
[CODE]cd /array0[/CODE]
[CODE]mkdir files[/CODE]
[CODE]chown USERNAMEHERE files[/CODE]
