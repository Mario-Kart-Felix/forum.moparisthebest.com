    <title>Teleport height change loading incorrect objects/items</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/teleport-height-change-loading-incorrect-objects-items/488787</link>
    <description>Hello, I am currently having trouble with my teleporting method and how it preforms actions. When using ladders/stairs, they all use the same teleport method &quot;teleport(x, y, z)&quot;. This works, and there is also a highchange check, so &quot;if(HightChange)&quot; refresh the objects/items on the floor. This part also works. The part that I am having trouble with is the actual object/item loading. I added the refresh method about 5 times in the height change to see what the problem was and the items refresh 5 times (&quot;flash&quot;) then the character gets teleported. So basically whats happening is the items are being loaded from the target floor but on the previous floor. Sorry for the VERY bad wording I just woke up (yeah, 4 o&#39;clock on a Sunday...). Here is the teleport method:

[code]	public void teleport(final Position position) {
		final int oldHeight = getPosition().getZ();
		final boolean stopPacket = stopPlayerPacket();
		if (!stopPacket) {
			setStopPacket(true);
		}
		resetAllActions();
		movePlayer(position);
        getActionSender().sendMapState(0);
		getActionSender().removeInterfaces();
        final boolean heightChange = position.getZ() != oldHeight;
		final Player player = this;
        CycleEventHandler.getInstance().addEvent(this, new CycleEvent() {
            @Override
            public void execute(CycleEventContainer container) {
                if (heightChange) {
                	player.reloadRegion();
                }
        		if (!stopPacket) {
    				setStopPacket(false);
        		}
        		getMovementHandler().reset();
        		container.stop();
            }
			@Override
			public void stop() {
			}
        }, 1);
	}

	public void reloadRegion() {
		WalkInterfaces.addWalkableInterfaces(this);
		WalkInterfaces.checkChickenOption(this);
		ObjectHandler.getInstance().loadObjects(this);
		//GlobalObjectHandler.createGlobalObject();
        GroundItemManager.getManager().refreshLandscapeDisplay(this);
		Npc.reloadTransformedNpcs(this);
	}[/code]

So I basically added &quot;reloadRegion();&quot; about 5-10 times and sendMessage at the end just to see what was going on (my way of debugging this situation. And basically what is happening is the character is being teleported to the target floor but is still seeing the floor it was teleporting from, at the same time, the objects/items for the target floor are being loaded to the floor that is teleporting from then the user is teleported to the target floor.

EDIT: P.S. I am using RuneSource, Also when you change floors a load of times, the items visibly &quot;dupe&quot; but only one can be picked up.

Like I said before, sorry for the bad wording.</description>
