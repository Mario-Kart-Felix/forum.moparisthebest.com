    <title>Bad couple weeks</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bad-couple-weeks/16029</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not really sure where to post this but I really just want to get my thoughts out, no one say that I don&#39;t have friends because I&#39;m posting this here etc.. because I&#39;m just trying to vent and I have told a lot of my friends already.

Well basically the last two weeks have been hell for me and the people around me. First of all I found out that I might have been moving away from here and all my friends and family, I told my girlfriend at the time which lead to events which ultimately ended up with her and I breaking up. Then she kept inviting me over and calling me and stuff then she would tell me to leave her alone and I would then she would call me and it would be a cycle over and over again. Then one night she told her mom to make me leave and said how I wouldn&#39;t leave her alone which is total bullshit. Her mom then went and applied to get a fucking restraining order against me. So I&#39;m like fine whatever. The night before they went she had called me saying how much she missed me and wanted to be with me still and that she wanted to be by me in school before all of this happened. I said fine whatever and then I went to bed. Then my alarm clock didnt go off and I didn&#39;t end up going to school. She called me later last night and told me that she had went with her mom and that it would be a four year restraining order, I got pissed and asked her on what grounds and she started playing dumb. My mom then took me over to her house to get my stuff and to return her stuff to her. My mom told her that she(my exgf) had been contacting me and that there was no grounds for a restraining order. Then we left and I&#39;ve been trying to get over her and what not but I&#39;ve been hurting bad, so that&#39;s one of my problems.

Then yesterday my brothers friend came over, and hes practically my adopted brother, her told me to wake up my brother because it was an emergancy. I don&#39;t really want to go into detail for his sake but he was having problems with his wife and she wanted to take their kid back to Canada where she used to live. So now I start worring about him.

Then today I went out with my friends to try to get my mind off of this shit and have a good time and get really fucked up. So I go and then about three or four hours ago we got a call from my cousins friends. I found out that my cousins mom died from cancer and that he had been drinking all day and tried to kill himself. So we went over there to make sure he was okay and try to help him out. He and I never really got along and in fact got into many fights, but familys family. So I went over there and he was drunk and pissed off and started cussing me and my friend out and then finally I told him that even though we haven&#39;t got along in the past that I&#39;m there for him and then he give me a couple hugs and told me he didn&#39;t know what to do. So I started to worry about him.

So I lost the girl I love, My practically adopted brother is fighting with who he loves and might not see his kid for a while, and my cousin tried to kill himself. I was trying to keep clean and I feel guilty because I went out and snorted two addys, drank god knows how much, and smoked a few bowls and blunts. 

I don&#39;t expect anyone to feel bad for me but I just wanted to get this off my chest. Thank you for reading this.</description>

<blockquote>When internet drama plays out in a public form or, more commonly, the accuser's head, resulting in declaration of internet guilt of they accused. Usually the accused is riding the lollercoaster and their friends bait and troll the insane person. Occasionally, some faggots will speak up in support of the accuser. These people are frequently furries or plushies, with the occasional voraphile. The reason for this has yet to be determined. Several notable cases have resulted in internet restraining orders.</blockquote>

              <p>Well, update time… I skipped out of school today and I just got a call from my buddy saying my ex was asking if I was okay and what not. And apparently she went over to his house crying last night about me and had her mom drop the restraining order. Now I just got a call from her crying but my phone died so this ought to be intresting.</p>
