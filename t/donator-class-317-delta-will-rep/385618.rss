    <title>Donator Class - 317 Delta - Will Rep</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/donator-class-317-delta-will-rep/385618</link>
    <description>So I added my regular donator etc, my client had the object already built in apparently.

Now, I recently made a model for a new donor class, and I coded the new class in, now I have a couple questions:

1) How can I make it so that it now loads my new symbol? Would it be client-sided or server sided?
2) Once add the symbol to my sprites folder, do I need to do anything server-sided from there?

Also, if you could.
How would I assign a new crown to a new player rights (Player rights = 4 or something). The symbol was already made, and is already added to my sprites folder

Thank you!</description>

              <p>Are you using a refactored client or a deob?<br>
Either way, you need to look inside method73() in the Client class.<br>
For refactored clients:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (myPrivilege == 1)
    pushMessage(myPlayer.textSpoken, 2, "@crDon@" + myPlayer.name);</code></pre>
<p>Youâ€™ll know where it goes if you look through method73.</p>
