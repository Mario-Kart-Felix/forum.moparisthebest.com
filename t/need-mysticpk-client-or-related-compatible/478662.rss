Huh? It doesnt really matter what client you use?<br>
Just fill in the ip&gt; 127.0.0.1<br>
Then it should work. Or use an ip changer…<br>
Anyways provide some more information.<br>

wat.</p>
<p>Just download a decent source that has a client with it. Drop mysticpkz or whatever that is, sounds bad anyway.<br>

<p>If he doesn’t even have a client for the source he wants, I highly doubt it’s a project. In which case he can just download a better source and client which will provide him with a better base.</p>
<p>I believe I was helping.</p>
