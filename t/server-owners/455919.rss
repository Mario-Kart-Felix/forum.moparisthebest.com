    <description>What drives you to keep your server up?

The reason I&#39;m asking is that I&#39;ve been rather inactive on here for the past month, mostly because I decided to stop developing my server.  The reason is that I could make a really nice server, put months into making loads of custom content and everything, but there wouldn&#39;t be much of a point really.  If I put it online, it would more than likely get nothing  but younger kids who can&#39;t pay attention to something for more than 5 minutes, ddossed until I give them moderator, or just be ignored.

I do know that nice content attracts players, but it just seems like a waste of time anymore, every &#39;good &#39; server I&#39;ve ever been on typically dies within a couple months due to those reasons, it just seems like the RSPS community is too immature anymore to build an actual server from the ground up, unless they get lucky and get some nice first players.

I more than likely won&#39;t continue developing, but I was just wondering what keeps you going if you own a server, besides the monetary benefits because that&#39;s an obvious one.</description>

<p>I could care less about the monetary gains. I do this because It’s my favorite childhood video game.

They of course lack the experience and proffesionalisim needed to continue a long-term MMORPG Private Server. I could go on and make a huge list, but I’ll just sum it up. I keep developing because I have so many unique ideas for content that MUST be implemented in-game.</p>

</aside>
<p>That is actually one reason I ever cared about RSPS, the fact that A huge part of my childhood was RS.  And yeah, the reason I question if I ever want to actually own a server or not is because of the mass amounts of children (I’m only 16, but more mature than the typical rsps player).</p>
<p>I did actually start a new private project recently just for the hell of it.  I kind of thought it over for a while and decided to start again.</p>

              <p>My community does it, it’s just lovely to have a few hundred people that get on daily to play something you work on to keep online. It’s also rewarding to see responses to content being put in the game like custom quests and new areas.</p>

<p>I…don’t know exactly… It’s addicting, I guess? To take the great aspects of Runescape, and to make them into something unique in it’s own way… I don’t even factor the money part in. It’s irrelevant to me. Honestly, I love the communities you can build, and the great people you meet.</p>

              <p>Well, first of all I enjoy coding, it’s what I do.<br>
So I like to show my progress to others by putting the server online.<br>
I ALWAYS had mature people as my first players, I don’t actually know why, it’s weird.<br>
And I enjoy playing my own server legit as an undercover player who nobody notices so I can actually see what’s going on.</p>
<p>The donation money that I get is meaningless to me, just use it to pay off the host.</p>

<p>That’s part of the reason I decided to stop developing, mostly because of how bad the vast majority of this community is.  I know there are plenty of actually mature people on, but they’re outweighed by the idiots.</p>
