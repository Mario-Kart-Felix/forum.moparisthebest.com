    <description>i am using a blank server and i was doing some exploring to see what was there and what wasn&#39;t and i went to go up to the 3rd floor of the lumbridge castle(where the bank is) and it took me to a height where i cannot go down. i tries editing my height in the character file but it keeps going back to 3.  i also tried deleting the file and making a new one but it still is at height 3, how do i get it back to 0?</description>
