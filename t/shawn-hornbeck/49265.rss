    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;ST. LOUIS - Shawn Hornbeck said he couldn&#39;t bear to watch news reports about his lengthy disappearance and kept praying he would be reunited with his family, according to interviews broadcast Thursday on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Neighbors said Shawn was not physically held captive. He was living with Devlin on the ground floor of a modest apartment complex next to a railroad track. Residents say they often spotted Shawn out and about, visiting friends on his bicycle or playing video games with the apartment door open.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>No, but he was allowed to <span class="bbcode-b">sleep over friends houses</span>. He could have snuck back in, Splinter Cell style, and killed the guy. But that’s all speculation, he could easily have escaped or contacted the police any number of times.</p>

<p>Yeah, somebody waves a gun in your face and makes you suck his dick, you get scared and horrified, shocked and confused. But life fucking sucks, shit happens. He’s being displayed on TV as a hero, for doing jack shit. In fact, if what your saying is true, he did less than nothing, he gave in and gave up. He could’ve tried to escape, he didn’t. He had access to a bike, alot of free time, and <span class="bbcode-b">plenty of videogames for training</span>. He just had to get practice on splinter cell, and he could have taken that fat fucker out in the dead of night with a butcher knife.</p>
