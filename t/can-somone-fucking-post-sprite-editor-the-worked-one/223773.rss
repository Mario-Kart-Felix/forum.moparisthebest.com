<p>Lol, coming from the kid who took over an hour to figure out the simple PunBB bug on <a href="http://RSCdevils.com" rel="nofollow noopener">RSCdevils.com</a> or w/e. I don’t need to prove anything to you or anyone else on this forum. You’re opinion matters just as much as Muppet, Mubby or w/e the hell he is. Since you think you’re better than me, please do explain how a “pro” such as yourself needs to leech someones sprite editor instead of just creating your own?</p>
