    <description>Purpose: Help people with compilers
Diffuclty: 1.0/3.0 if your a begginer


Ok some of you i noticed are getting errors with your complier that say&#39;s cannot find path specified and all that its because the server is like one big rock and the files in it are little rocks say on your server you trade a npc the runeserver.bat sends a request for the npchandler to do its part then npchandler sends a request to autospawn and then autospawn sends everything back to the runserver.bat so basiclly if you right click on the compiler it should say something like this 
C:\Program Files\Java jdk so what you have to do is goto your documents and for the adress bar type in C:\Program Files\Java and for the first file it should say something like this jdk1.6.0 for the name what you have to do is goto your program files and find the name of your first folder this is the code [code]@echo off
title Compiler
&quot;%ProgramFiles%\Java\jdk1.6.0\bin\javac.exe&quot; -cp . *.java
pause
[/code]but you might have a different java installed on your computer so change the jdk1.6.0 to something like jdk.1.6.2 it depends what your java is but make sure the file is jdk

Well if you have any farther questions please feel free to send me a message or post hope i helpt you!</description>
