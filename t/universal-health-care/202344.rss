We have Medicaid and Medicare.<br>

Because people are taking more out of it then we are putting in.</p>

<p>Anyways, for the good of mankind what they do is right, but unfortunately they think about the money, fucking idiots. Sweden has universal health care, and our economy is strong enough. It all has to do with greedy fags trying to get richer and richer when they don’t need it.</p>

Actually, don’t do that, if everyone moved here the system would fail.</p>

              <p>my dad goes to the va hospital in the usa and they have universal healthcare. the problem with it is every thing is priortized. he waited and got his surgery on his gallbladder rescheduled 4 times. so i say , no</p>
<p>jme - in the usa rich people get taxed enough. my family is not rich but i feel sorry for rich people. they usually work hard to make their money and the goverment taxes them out of their ass.</p>

              <p>Something else they could look into, is perhaps charging based on how much money you make. If your dirt poor, even though your probably better of dead, you shouldn’t have to pay very much instead of leaving you there to die. If you are a rich fucker, charge the full thing.</p>
<p>I don’t know shit though, it’s probably a really bad idea.</p>

              <p>We have it in Canada, and it’s good sometimes. Example, my grandma’s appendix ruptured and caused quite a bit of damage. She was in florida for the winter, and the surgery was going to be $700,000. So instead, they flew her back to Canada in a helicopter (which was free) and they did the surgery. She was in the hospital for nearly 2 weeks and when she was all better, she walked out without having to pay a penny. Similar story for me as well, except I was already in Canada and was released in 3 days lol.</p>
<p>Yeah we get taxed to fuck, but jobs also pay a lot more. I think the vast majority of people here would not want to lose their universal healthcare.</p>
<p>The other problem is waiting times. If it’s not a true emergency, you can expect to wait a while. Sometimes for minor things such as an eye injury (someone slap shotted a hockey puck at me) I had to wait like 3 hours. Other times were like ~40 minutes. To see a specialist, I have to wait half a year just to get surgery on my knee. It’s starting to drive me insane too, though I am enjoying my prescribed vicodin in the mean time <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> One of the main causes of these waiting times are old fuckers who go everytime they have the sniffles or a sore finger from picking their arse too much.</p>
