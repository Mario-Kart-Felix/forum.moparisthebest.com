    <title>Adding models and ints - not working</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-models-and-ints-not-working/395166</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I have followed just about every guide that I can find, I have spent over 6 hours trying to figure this out, and no luck so far. 
These are the thing that I have tried:
-I have downloaded the models, put them into my &quot;raw&quot; folder
-Changed the &quot;raw&quot; folder to &quot;Raw&quot;
-Tried to fix the model preloader
 None of these have worked so far.
What happens when I try and spawn it in game, is it freezes my client.

My &quot;raw&quot; folder is located in &quot;client/cache/data/raw/&quot;

If anyone could help me, that would be great. Thanks.</description>
