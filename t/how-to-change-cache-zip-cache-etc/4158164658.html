Lol, u can also refer to Cjs sig, because you both cant tell the difference between client and fucking server<br>
This is client related, that means it goes in the client hacking section, and i could care less about rep, and because you think that i think rep makes me better than others, makes you even more retarded, because you care about rep, and your butt buddies probably repped you too, fuck off downy.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>good, and yes I can tell between server and client. Server hacking section is for exploits on the clients, the only tut I really see was laurent’s.</p>
<p>Other then you austin earned his rep by releasing good sources, working on real projects, and being nice to people. You on the other hand have probably gotten 200 rep by trolling in topics.</p>
<p>Btw ass and butt are the same thing, so you by using a the same type of words proves you got served.</p>

Coming back, only to get it through your thick skulls, rep doesnt mean anything, and i lul at you that you guys still think rep is precious, its the equivalent of whale shit.</p>
<p>Using the same type of word proves i got owned?</p>
<p>Lol.</p>
<p>You just trolled yourself, I don’t even have to say anything there.</p>
<blockquote>The "Server hacking section" isn't for client exploits. Austin is a fucking idiot and his sources are terrible. And the fact you keep bringing up rep shows that you care about it, makes sense to care about an imaginary number abused by a bunch of faggots over the internet right?</blockquote>
This, though don't bother asshole, they don't get it :\
<p>And working on real projects?</p>
<p>Lol, this isnt anything difficult…  a simple COPY SERBER SROUCE NAM CHANJ DEN IP UR GUD LEL</p>
<p>thats all this will ever be, and you just keep digging yourself into a deeper hole.</p>
<p>And austin, if you did not know how to do this, then i can tell just from that, that your servers must have been piles of turd, and there are already like 4 tuts on this,which is why its unneeded, which is what i said in my first post, so you guys think before you start spitting out bullshit, i wasn’t trolling, seems you are though.</p>
<blockquote>this is server tutorial section meant for tutorials. In matter of fact I honestly don't care about rep.</blockquote>
Then why do you keep bringing it up? You just contradicted yourself...
And server, this does not have ANYTHING to do with the server, yes, tutorials, for fucking server tutorials, not client related things, which is what this is... and thats kind of why it was moved

<p>Lol, u can also refer to Cjs sig, because you both cant tell the difference between client and fucking server<br>
This is client related, that means it goes in the client hacking section, and i could care less about rep, and because you think that i think rep makes me better than others, makes you even more retarded, because you care about rep, and your butt buddies probably repped you too, fuck off downy.</p>

<p>good, and yes I can tell between server and client. Server hacking section is for exploits on the clients, the only tut I really see was laurent’s.</p>
<p>Other then you austin earned his rep by releasing good sources, working on real projects, and being nice to people. You on the other hand have probably gotten 200 rep by trolling in topics.</p>
<p>Btw ass and butt are the same thing, so you by using a the same type of words proves you got served.</p>
<p>Now that the off topic is done, it’s time to get back on topic.<br>

Coming back, only to get it through your thick skulls, rep doesnt mean anything, and i lul at you that you guys still think rep is precious, its the equivalent of whale shit.</p>
<p>Using the same type of word proves i got owned?</p>

<p>This, though don’t bother asshole, they don’t get it :\</p>
<p>And working on real projects?</p>
<p>Lol, this isnt anything difficult…  a simple COPY SERBER SROUCE NAM CHANJ DEN IP UR GUD LEL</p>
<p>thats all this will ever be, and you just keep digging yourself into a deeper hole.</p>
<p>And austin, if you did not know how to do this, then i can tell just from that, that your servers must have been piles of turd, and there are already like 4 tuts on this,which is why its unneeded, which is what i said in my first post, so you guys think before you start spitting out bullshit, i wasn’t trolling, seems you are though.</p>

<p>Then why do you keep bringing it up? You just contradicted yourself…<br>
