    <description>[center]Difficulty: Easy 1/10
Tested on: Project dungeonfest client and project ecko client
Knowledge: Basic java knowledge
As requested by Austin Cadle, I&#39;m posting this tut on how to change the cache revision and the link in the cache downloader.

This is if you were using a cache decoder:
Step 1:
Lets say I zipped my 666 cache all over again, this is what you do.

Step 2:
Next do this: use this format: [b].(what you wanna name it)_cache
[/b]

[IMG]http://i52.tinypic.com/oa0p47.jpg[/img]


[b]Make sure it&#39;s .zip (as you would know)[/b]


Step 3:
Then comes the fun part!!!!!!

option 1:
Download drop box, then go to the folder and do this with the zipped file:

[img]http://i56.tinypic.com/qpmb60.png[/img]

Then wait till its done and copy paste the link/replace the link to/in your client, change the revision, and change the name of what it used to be called and you should be good to go.

Here&#39;s an example I put together(with a 562 loading 663 cache)(clientsettings.java):
Before:
[code=java]public class ClientSettings {

	public static String getCacheDir() {
		return System.getProperty(&quot;user.home&quot;) + &quot;.derbyscapev3_cache&quot;; //only change this if you edit cache
	}
	public static final String cacheLink = &quot;http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39980951/Matrix/cache5.zip&quot;; //make sure it zip
	public static final int cacheRevision = 5; //change this if you edit cache
	
	
	public static final String ip = &quot;Your IP&quot;;
	public static final int port = 43594;
	public static final String background_music_name = &quot;Scape Original&quot;; //rs classic music &lt;3
	public static final String serverName = &quot;DerbyScape&quot;; //server name, also auto changes client title and load bar
	public static final String websiteLink = &quot;Website link here(for your website [u][b]NOT[/b][/u] cache)&quot;; //so it goes ur website instead of rs, example on acc creation terms service button
	public static final Color startLoadClientBackgroundColor = Color.black; //Color.black default
	public static final boolean disable_server_list = true; //dont disable this :D, ofc you may but then serverlist doesnt work anymore
	public static final boolean disable_ukeys_check = true; //containers table information check but ppl give weird names for stuff as: &quot;ukeys&quot;
	public static final boolean disable_keys_request = false; //if this true, disable_ukeys_check has to be true too, when this true, you can load client without connecting server

[/code]

After:
[code=java]public class ClientSettings {

	public static String getCacheDir() {
		return System.getProperty(&quot;user.home&quot;) + &quot;.derbyscapev4_cache&quot;; //[b]only change this if you edit cache[/b]
	}
	public static final String cacheLink = &quot;http://dl.dropbox.com/u/38224169/.rspscache_cache.zip&quot;; //make sure it zip
	public static final int cacheRevision = 6; //[b]change this if you edit cache[/b]
	
	
	public static final String ip = &quot;Your IP&quot;;
	public static final int port = 43594;
	public static final String background_music_name = &quot;Scape Original&quot;; //rs classic music &lt;3
	public static final String serverName = &quot;DerbyScape&quot;; //server name, also auto changes client title and load bar
	public static final String websiteLink = &quot;Website link here(for your website [u][b]NOT[/b][/u] cache)&quot;; //so it goes ur website instead of rs, example on acc creation terms service button
	public static final Color startLoadClientBackgroundColor = Color.black; //Color.black default
	public static final boolean disable_server_list = true; //dont disable this :D, ofc you may but then serverlist doesnt work anymore
	public static final boolean disable_ukeys_check = true; //containers table information check but ppl give weird names for stuff as: &quot;ukeys&quot;
	public static final boolean disable_keys_request = false; //if this true, disable_ukeys_check has to be true too, when this true, you can load client without connecting server

[/code]

Now onto lets say you have cache link, but you just want to change the cache:

Change this:

[code=java]public class ClientSettings {

	public static String getCacheDir() {
		return System.getProperty(&quot;user.home&quot;) + &quot;your cache name&quot;; //only change this if you edit cache
	}
	public static final String cacheLink = &quot;previous cache link&quot;; //make sure it zip
	public static final int cacheRevision = 5; //change this if you edit cache [/code]

To this:

[code=java]public class ClientSettings {

	public static String getCacheDir() {
		return System.getProperty(&quot;user.home&quot;) + &quot;what you wanna call it&quot;; //only change this if you edit cache
	}
	public static final String cacheLink = &quot;The link you got&quot;; //make sure it zip
	public static final int cacheRevision = 5; //change this to the next number. [/code]


Now an example for 317s (this is from project ecko):
You should find this in client.java
This code:
 [code=java5]
			drawLoadingText(15, &quot;Downloading Cache&quot;);
			String url = &quot;cache link here(needs to have .zip at the end)&quot;;
			if (Math.random() &gt; 0.5) {
				url = &quot;cache link here(needs to have .zip at the end)&quot;;
				System.out.println(&quot;Project Ecko&quot;);[/code]


Now just replace The cache links with the link you found, save, compile, then run.

I hope this helped.

Because some noobs might copy and paste this on rune-serv3R or rUn3-L0cUs. I&#39;ve made a little rule:


This was made by me and can&#39;t be re-posted/posted by anyone but me or people that I give permission to. If caught I will request a moderator lock they&#39;re post/remove it.

[u][b]I only give permission of re-posting this onto other communities to these people:[/b][/u]

<p>good, and yes I can tell between server and client. Server hacking section is for exploits on the clients, the only tut I really see was laurent’s.</p>

<p>And austin, if you did not know how to do this, then i can tell just from that, that your servers must have been piles of turd, and there are already like 4 tuts on this,which is why its unneeded, which is what i said in my first post, so you guys think before you start spitting out bullshit, i wasn’t trolling, seems you are though.</p>

<p>Lol, u can also refer to Cjs sig, because you both cant tell the difference between client and fucking server<br>
This is client related, that means it goes in the client hacking section, and i could care less about rep, and because you think that i think rep makes me better than others, makes you even more retarded, because you care about rep, and your butt buddies probably repped you too, fuck off downy.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>GF, told you it was the wrong section, now I’m leaving this topic.<br>

<p>good, and yes I can tell between server and client. Server hacking section is for exploits on the clients, the only tut I really see was laurent’s.</p>
<p>Other then you austin earned his rep by releasing good sources, working on real projects, and being nice to people. You on the other hand have probably gotten 200 rep by trolling in topics.</p>
<p>Btw ass and butt are the same thing, so you by using a the same type of words proves you got served.</p>
<p>Now that the off topic is done, it’s time to get back on topic.[/quote]<br>
Coming back, only to get it through your thick skulls, rep doesnt mean anything, and i lul at you that you guys still think rep is precious, its the equivalent of whale shit.</p>
<p>Using the same type of word proves i got owned?</p>
<p>Lol.</p>
<p>You just trolled yourself, I don’t even have to say anything there.</p>
<blockquote>The "Server hacking section" isn't for client exploits. Austin is a fucking idiot and his sources are terrible. And the fact you keep bringing up rep shows that you care about it, makes sense to care about an imaginary number abused by a bunch of faggots over the internet right?</blockquote>
This, though don't bother asshole, they don't get it :\
<p>And working on real projects?</p>
<p>Lol, this isnt anything difficult…  a simple COPY SERBER SROUCE NAM CHANJ DEN IP UR GUD LEL</p>
<p>thats all this will ever be, and you just keep digging yourself into a deeper hole.</p>
<p>And austin, if you did not know how to do this, then i can tell just from that, that your servers must have been piles of turd, and there are already like 4 tuts on this,which is why its unneeded, which is what i said in my first post, so you guys think before you start spitting out bullshit, i wasn’t trolling, seems you are though.</p>
<blockquote>this is server tutorial section meant for tutorials. In matter of fact I honestly don't care about rep.</blockquote>
Then why do you keep bringing it up? You just contradicted yourself...
And server, this does not have ANYTHING to do with the server, yes, tutorials, for fucking server tutorials, not client related things, which is what this is... and thats kind of why it was moved
