    <title>Can someone help me with this?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone-help-me-with-this/235240</link>
    <description>Okay guys, I finally got my char screen to work, with ::char command, turns out I wasn&#39;t supposed to use 771 as an interface, it was 3559. Anyway, I&#39;m trying to get it to where when you first log-in, you can&#39;t move until you type ::char and change your characters look. How would I do this? Something like this?

[code]
    	if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Char&quot;)) {
		if (newLogin == 0);
		showInterface(3559);
                 sM(&quot;Hello&quot;+playerName+&quot;you are now designing your character.&quot;);
                 }else{
		 if (newLogin == 1);
                 sM(&quot;Welcome back&quot;+playerName+&quot;you&#39;ve already characterized your character.&quot;);
			}[/code]

[b]Note:[/b] Please take into consideration I am a [b]basic[/b] coder. :) Thanks.

I keep getting this error and I don&#39;t know how to fix it.

[code]
client.java:4717: cannot find symbol
symbol  : variable firstLogin
location: class client
                if (firstLogin = 0);
                    ^

client.java:4721: cannot find symbol
symbol  : variable firstLogin
location: class client
                if (firstLogin = 1);
                    ^
