    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone-help-me-with-this/398208</link>
    <description>ok i have been looking around fr a tut but havent found one so i came to moparscape :). i wa wondering how to to add some stuff.
1. i wanted to make some skulls. but they change. (ex. 0 kills player has regular white pvp skull, 2 kill streak player gets bronze bh skull, 4 kill streak player has 2nd bh skull, 6 kill streak player gets green bh skull, 8 kill streak blue bh skull, 10 kill streak is red bh skull.
2. i would also like to add custom drops to the players with those skulls. lik a player with a red skull would drop a vls if he had it or not. 
Please help me (im using PI)</description>
