    <title>Making A Server Public</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-a-server-public/428437</link>
    <description>Hello everyone I am having a very &quot;odd&quot; problem you may say. Basically I port-fowarded, got the no-ip and all that good stuff. When I run the server and check its status RL says it is online. I can connect to it when I put the IP to &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; in my Client.java, but I cannot connect to it when I change the IP to the &quot;No-Ip&quot;. I am connecting to it through the same PC I am hosting it on, so I would assume I would use 127.0.0.1, and the JAR that OTHER people will use will contain the &quot;No-Ip&quot;? If this is the case I tried to connect to it through my laptop and could not do so. The laptop client had the &quot;no-ip&quot; in client.java. 

If anyone could enlighten me on what is going on and what I will have to do so some friends can get on, please let me know.</description>

              <p>I tried this with my laptop. How ever it has the same IP as my laptop. I used the No-Ip on my laptop and could not connect to my PC. Is that because it is the same IP? I am a little confused on that subject. Any help would be appreciated, thanks. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>its fine dont worry about it the client you release to the public make it your no-ip but the client you have keep it 127.0.0.1</p>
