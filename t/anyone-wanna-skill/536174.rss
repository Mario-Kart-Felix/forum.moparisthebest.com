    <title>Anyone wanna skill?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-wanna-skill/536174</link>
    <description>Not sure if it will get deleted or if this is the right place to post this so if not sorry. 

Anyway, I feel like skilling but everyone knows unless you&#39;re listening to music skilling alone is very boring. 
I&#39;m going to be skilling fishing, mining/smithing, or dungeoneering. (I know dung isn&#39;t a skilling skill but eh.)
If anyone wants to tag along and come skill with me (RS3 not oldschool) join my friends chat or post below.  Join &quot;Astral Runes&quot; or &quot;Panda x Man&quot;
If that doesn&#39;t work post below and we can figure something out. 

MUST BE MEMBER!

EDIT: My skills are below, please have atleast 50+ mining/smithing, 20+ dung and 60-70 fishing.</description>
