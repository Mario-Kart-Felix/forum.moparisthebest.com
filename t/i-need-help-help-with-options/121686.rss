    <title>I need help help with Options</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-help-with-options/121686</link>
    <description>When working on my server, i came across a problem with the wannetalk option selection.

After typing in the question asks, the first option answer, the second option answer and the third, i was unsure how to tell the server which one was selected.

Heres my question: How do you make an action occur after one of the options is selected?</description>
