    <title>[pi]making an item bonus based upon a players stat?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-making-an-item-bonus-based-upon-a-players-stat/370364</link>
    <description>is it possible in pi to make it so that when you equip a certain weapon, the strength bonus of that weapon is dependent upon that players strength level?

for example if a player wielded a bronze scimitar and had a strength level of 1, the scim would have a +1 strength bonus, and if a player with 99 strength wielded it, it would have a +99 strength bonus. 

is this possible? and if so then how could i do this?</description>
