<p>I mentioned it to Mopar but he says he does not want to have another even like ‘Thebeanie’ were he got his account stolen, so then they go around muting everyone.</p>
<p>But Mod like You, Miss silabsoft and Mod taharok should have them rights as you are the more senior members of this community and should know how it works.<br>
Plus the other mods do nothing but lock topics, i know and you should know a mod is not just about keeping a forum clean.</p>
<p>Its about encouraging the members to do whats good for them and the forum, teaching them the meaning to moparscape because a large percentage of moparscape do not know the meaning to that community.</p>
<p>Quite a few of the Moparscape moderators seemed to have just give up, they worry about flame and spam, when they have the power over these people?<br>
Seriously you suggest a change and the first thing you see is ‘It would cause to much flame and spam’ is not that one reason to why a moparscape moderator was given that position? Moparscape mod’s you are supposed to be the higher members of that forums, so start acting like it take control, don’t let a bunch of unruly kids take over the forum.</p>
<p>The Moparscape moderators go through ‘active patch’s’ you see them on for a few days doing what they need to do but then you dont see them for another few weeks.</p>
<p>Anyway Tree like i said i agree with the most of what you have to say.[/quote]<br>
i kinda agree with you, ikiliki used to lock and lock,he helped a lot, but he seems to have lost intrest, same with a few others,they need to be active, and watching most the time, plus, they need to have good grammar and need to be mature.</p>

              <p>I stopped being a Moparscape CM and moderator for a few reasons. Firstly, most of the people there are incredibly greedy.</p>
<p>However, I’ve got some points to raise too when it comes to moderators. Melissa T can be nice and all, but she just doesn’t seem to have the english skills required to express herself properly. The same can be said for God of Ikiliki on many occasions.<br>
Sure they make an effort, and that’s nice. But this is an english speaking community. Moderators are, in most cases, the face of the community.<br>
Poor english and/or grammar doesn’t cut it. Especially not in stickied topics (where grammar is very important - let’s face it, nobody reads a stickied topic with poor spelling and grammar without thinking the forums are a joke) or lock messages (where they should be explaining what the person did wrong, in a very clear and easy to understand manner).</p>
<p>As for your point about giving sectional mods more power (eg: warn to mute privelages) I agree. However you and Miss Silabsoft should be the only two Moparscape mods that receive them, because you’re both mature (and just as old if not older then the gmods) and I believe the two of you would use those abilities properly and in a professional manner. I hate to say it, but I couldn’t trust the others with those abilities (they’re too young, and too trigger happy on a lot of occasions).</p>
