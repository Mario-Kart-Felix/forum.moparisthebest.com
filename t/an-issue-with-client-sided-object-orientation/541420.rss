    <title>An Issue with client-sided Object Orientation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/an-issue-with-client-sided-object-orientation/541420</link>
    <description>Hello all, I&#39;ve been stuck on a small (but frustrating) issue for some time now. I had originally given up, but have come back determined. I have managed to spawn global objects through the client with the help of a tutorial by user Dutchboy, but it seems as if they don&#39;t want to orient themselves in different directions. Here is the public void that spawns the objects:

[code]    	public void makeGlobalObject(int i, int j, int k, int l, int i1, int j1)
    	{
        	int k1 = mapX - 6;
        	int l1 = mapY - 6;
        	int i2 = i - k1 * 8;
        	int j2 = j - l1 * 8;
        	byte byte0 = 10;
        	int k2 = anIntArray1177[byte0];
        	if(j2 &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; j2 &lt; 103 &amp;&amp; i2 &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; i2 &lt; 103)
            		method130(404, -1, k, l, k2, j2, i1, j1, i2, 0);
    	}[/code]

Int &quot;l&quot; should be controlling the object&#39;s orientation. For troubleshooting purposes I&#39;ll post the method it references below:

[code]    private final void method130(int i, int j, int k, int l, int i1, int j1, int k1, 
            int l1, int i2, int j2)
    {
        Class30_Sub1 class30_sub1 = null;
        for(Class30_Sub1 class30_sub1_1 = (Class30_Sub1)aClass19_1179.method252(); class30_sub1_1 != null; class30_sub1_1 = (Class30_Sub1)aClass19_1179.method254(false))
        {
            if(class30_sub1_1.anInt1295 != l1 || class30_sub1_1.anInt1297 != i2 || class30_sub1_1.anInt1298 != j1 || class30_sub1_1.anInt1296 != i1)
                continue;
            class30_sub1 = class30_sub1_1;
            break;
        }

        if(class30_sub1 == null)
        {
            class30_sub1 = new Class30_Sub1();
            class30_sub1.anInt1295 = l1;
            class30_sub1.anInt1296 = i1;
            class30_sub1.anInt1297 = i2;
            class30_sub1.anInt1298 = j1;
            method89(false, class30_sub1);
            aClass19_1179.method249(class30_sub1);
        }
        class30_sub1.anInt1291 = k;
        class30_sub1.anInt1293 = k1;
        class30_sub1.anInt1292 = l;
        class30_sub1.anInt1302 = j2;
        class30_sub1.anInt1294 = j;
        if(i &gt; 0);
    }[/code]

In case you&#39;re wondering, the only thing contained in the class30_sub1 java file is the declaration of the public int associated with &quot;l&quot;. I have tried mocking the makeglobalobject void that was originally held in the server files, but to no avail. The reason I am trying to host this client-side is because of the objects spawning slowly when held server-side.

The source is Delta. I could upload the client.java and class30_sub1 if further troubleshooting materials are necessary. I appreciate your time for reading this, and any help would be appreciated.</description>
