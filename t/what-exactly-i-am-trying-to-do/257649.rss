    <title>What exactly i am trying to do</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-exactly-i-am-trying-to-do/257649</link>
    <description>Okay guys, this is what i am trying to do,
My idea is to have all the players highscores transfered to a highscores.txt file in your server folder.
But is there a way i can tell client.java (server side) to transfer the highscores over to the file?</description>
