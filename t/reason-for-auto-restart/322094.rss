    <title>Reason for auto restart</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/reason-for-auto-restart/322094</link>
    <description>For some unknown reason my server restarted last night while I was sleeping. I know this because all my applications were stopped and the uptime displayed by the command uptime is about 4 hours.

I want to find out what caused this though, because it could have been something nasty like a hardware failure. I know it wasn&#39;t a power failure because my digital clock would be whining at me to set the time. Maybe it&#39;s normal for ubuntu to shut down now and again for updates?

Oh and a site activity logging MySQL table crashed and had to be repaired. This could have been caused by the prompt shutdown itself though, not necessarily a hard disk fart.</description>

<p>Oh right yeh… it could have been the psu or something detecting a small power fluctuation. That was probably it if the logs do not show any shutdown scripts, do the logs show any shutdown scripts?</p>
<p>If it keeps happening I’ll have to live with it because I can’t afford a UPS.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of activity around the hours it went down. I’m having trouble making sense of it though…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Dec 26 04:24:15 server kernel: [3387955.207236] eth0: link down
Dec 26 04:24:51 server syslogd 1.5.0#1ubuntu1: restart.</code></pre>
<p>Lost ethernet connection so restart system? Right… So then it does a load of shit which I imagine is the shutdown script log, then the startup log. Then a bit later:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Dec 26 04:44:51 server -- MARK --
Dec 26 05:04:51 server -- MARK --
Dec 26 05:24:51 server -- MARK --
Dec 26 05:43:22 server syslogd 1.5.0#1ubuntu1: restart.</code></pre>
<p>Ok, so the server is alright up to 5:43 where it decides to restart again… More shutdown scripts blah blah… more restarts, more eth0 down etc etc. Makes no sense to me <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>I know it’s probably okay but most of my hardware is quite old and if there’s a problem I want to fix it now rather than when it causes significant downtime and I have to wait for parts etc.</p>
<p>Edit, googling ‘syslogd 1.5.0#1ubuntu1: restart.’ has informed me that this is the log rotating files. No idea why my server restarted now :S It’s funny how I see that message just before the shutdown scripts show though.</p>
