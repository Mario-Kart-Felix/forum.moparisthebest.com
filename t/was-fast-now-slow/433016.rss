    <title>Was fast, now slow?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/was-fast-now-slow/433016</link>
    <description>Hey guys, whenever my cache downloads to my client, it&#39;s incredibly slow. It was pretty fast yesterday like, I could to 3 and it&#39;s at 1, I count to 3 it&#39;s at 2, and so on. I stopped the download and came back to it today and whenever I try it, it&#39;s like, 1, count to eleven, 2 count to 20, and it just keeps getting slower and eventually just plain stops, any help?</description>

              <p>What makes you think anyone here can help you with that -.-</p>
<p>Contact your host about download speeds, not us…If you’re hosting it off a computer in your basement, then contact your ISP.</p>
