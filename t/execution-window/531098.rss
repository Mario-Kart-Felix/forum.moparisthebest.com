    <title>Execution window</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/execution-window/531098</link>
    <description>there&#39;s lots of things released such as: user control panels, tool bars etcetera. i kind of liked the idea but it was mainly server-sided and wasn&#39;t very adaptable. therefore, i&#39;ve made it based upon the client. if the cache hasn&#39;t been downloaded, a button &#39;download cache&#39; will appear - to obviously download the servers cache. if the cache already exists - two buttons will appear, &#39;play now&#39; and &#39;vote now&#39;. play now - running the client. vote now - opening an external URL to where ever. 
[b]the client will not start unless you click either &#39;Download cache&#39; or &#39;Play now&#39;[/b]
lastly, the window is a bit ugly so i&#39;ll be changing it.

here&#39;s what it has so far:


[ul][li]reads the cache, if the cache is in the user area: play now button will appear[/li]
[li]if cache isn&#39;t user area and the player clicks &#39;download cache&#39; it will download the cache[/li]
[li]menu bars and sub-menu bars[/li]
[li]using Java&#39;s built in colour chooser, i&#39;ve implemented it with the JFrame so you customize the theme of your client.[/li][/ul]

a lot more coming soon.
