    <title>Documentary on Technology</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/documentary-on-technology/388389</link>
    <description>I was wondering if anyone could help me out. I have to do a senior presentation on a social injustice. My injustice I choose is &quot;Does the digital divide freeze citizens of less developed nations in poverty?&quot; so I need to find a documentary to watch on this subject. Basically it just needs to be a documentary on technology in nations where technology is not readily available. I found one about the digital divide in Canada but seeing as there not really in poverty I am not sure as if I can use it. So anyone know of any documentaries about technology in Africa or another impoverished nation?</description>
