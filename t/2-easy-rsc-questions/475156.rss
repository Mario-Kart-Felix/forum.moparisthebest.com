    <title>2 Easy RSC Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2-easy-rsc-questions/475156</link>
    <description>Hey, I&#39;m just wondering a couple of things. I searched them both on the forums and I couldn&#39;t find any solutions.

My first question is, how do I see the ID of a specific NPC? I went to NpcLoc.xml to remove Master Fisher but everything is listed as an ID. I went from that to NPC Def and there it lists the names but not the ID&#39;s humph... :(  Anyone know how I can get the name with ID?

Second question is how to remove the duping glitch/glitches from Easy RSC. No point in releasing a server where all the oldies drop in and start duping all the best items. Would put a real kink in my plans.

Thanks for any help you can give, hopefully I can get them resolved.</description>

              <p>I’m not really interested in DQ. They made a lot of changes to the game and it would be so much more work to get it back to normal RSC than to just fix Easy RSC.</p>
<p>Still looking for help with how to fix the dupes in Easy RSC.</p>

<p>I suggest you use DarkQuest. Its mostly bug free and much more stable</p>
<p>you can svn check it out by downloading SVN Tortoise and "svn"ing this site <a href="http://subversion.assembla.com/svn/darkquest/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://subversion.assembla.com/svn/darkquest/</a></p>
