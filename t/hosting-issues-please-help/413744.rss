    <title>Hosting Issues Please Help</title>

    <description>Ok I have had continuous hosting issues for the server I am trying to release. So I am going to break it down bit by bit, and hope that this wonderful community can please help me with my problem that I have tried resolving for about a week now by myself. 

I am trying to host my 562 server. I have done the following... 

1. I have went to no-ip.com and made an account. 
2. I have downloaded the DUC v3.0.4
3. I have made an ip for my server &quot;fatalpkers.no-ip.biz&quot; to be precise. &lt;-- added to hosts and checked it in the DUC.
4. I went into my Linksys Cisco router -&gt; Application and Gaming -&gt; Port Range Forwarding (I&#39;m pretty sure it goes here, but there is also Single Port Forwarding.) I added the title RSPS &gt; External/ Internal Ports both 43594 &gt; Protocol &quot;Both&quot; &gt; To IP Address &quot;My IPv4&quot; &gt; and Enabled, Saved.
5. I went into my source and changed the IP &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; to &quot;fatalpkers.no-ip.biz&quot; in the following files = ClientSettings.Java, Applet_Sub1, and ServersList. (There may be more but I have not managed to find anymore IP inputs.)
6. Compiled with no errors and ran my server. 
- AND STILL IT WILL NOT WORK. PLEASE HELP 
- I will be willing to Team View, but only to a trusted member. (Dealing with IP and such makes me nervous :p )

<p>Also, try turning off your firewall and then try canyouseeme</p>
<p><em>Warning</em> Turning off your firewall is not considered “safe” and can leave your computer vunerable to attack, please take precautions when turning it off.</p>

<p>Then you did something wrong while portforwarding. Also, check if your firewall is allowing the port.</p>
