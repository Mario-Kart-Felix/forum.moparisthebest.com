    <title>Downloading moparscape on windows</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/downloading-moparscape-on-windows/547839</link>
    <description>I downloaded moparscape on windows and it worked fine the first time; however when i went to start a server it would say &quot;your account is already logged in&quot; and i could never log in.

I decided to re-install but now it doesn&#39;t even install.

It comes up on my computer saying &quot;download moparscape&quot; so i click it, then install; however, when i install it just quits and doesn&#39;t install. 

Is there a solution?

Thanks :)</description>
