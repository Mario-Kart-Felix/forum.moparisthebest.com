Your an idiot, how are you to tell people the FASTEST way to learn java just because you know java. Some people like to learn different ways, and perhaps your way will take 10x longer then their own way. Why don’t you just leave auroa alone and let him learn THE WAY HE WANTS TO LEARN. Why do you care so much? And I guarantee someone has the old demonik source.</p>

I just don’t really like to copy off of someones work, you see when you play alot of servers now, you can tell rscd is the base. I already got the basics down (i think) from rs2 packaged servers. If anyone has the demonik source it would be appreciated.<br>
[/quote]LOL you dont have the basics from rs2, rs2 is just leeching. seriously, if you EVER want to get anywhere with an rsc server, use rscdv25 or divinepk as the base, and learn java from a BOOK. rs2 coding is nothing like rsc. for rs2 an example of code would be <code>sendMessage("rs2 code is nothing like rsc code.");</code> whereas for rsc it would be <code>player.getActionSender().sendMessage("rsc code is very different from rs2 code.");</code><br>
also its not “copying” someone elses work, the source was released for a reason. so people can CODE it.[/quote]<br>
That’s because the void sendMessage(String) is in the same class as they are using it, which is probably some piled up shit in Client.java or so I’ve heard from rs2 servers.</p>
<p>This community could become average, to even good if people started TRYING to learn, asking for actual java/rsc development and gave it a go. Nobody in such long time has even tried to ask for help on something programming related, its all “how do i set up a server, help me edit some xml values” bla bla bla. If people try to do something and give it a go then the ones that know what they are doing will answer it and not flame.</p>

exactly, idk what this dude’s problem is. And btw, Mudclient.java, search for mc.createWindow(mc.windowWidth, mc.windowHeight + 11. Then change the name of the client fool.</p>

<p>dam, i want a basic server that at least has the ability to run, because with all these new sources, you can’t really learn anything because you are so tempted just to edit the xmls or xp rates and release it.<br>
[/quote]these new servers are easier to edit then just plain demonik, also if you dont know java then you wont be able to even edit/add anything to demonik so its not worth it. and for the people that do know how to code java, look at how far they got with the new sources. you basically cant do anything except edit xp rates or change xml values untill you really learn java, then you can code any source and make any source great.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Then how do you think people learn java so well? They start and start reading, and trying… Don’t say they don;t because they do.<br>
[/quote]not by reading java code, you will never get anywhere like that.</p>
<p>read a book on java, read a tutorial, learn the basics THEN look at java source code and start coding. thats how its done.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Fuck off. Don’t give advice if you don’t know Java yourself.</p>
<p>Ugh learning a (programming) language is still learning, and people differ. Some people prefer to read a lot of books to get the knowledge and then start trying to get the experience. I myself started with browsing mIRC code. Reading other peoples scripts and simply using them until I figured out what part did what. The same with Java. Just pick the way you prefer to learn and stick with it.</p>
<p>Don’t have the demonik source anymore though, sorry.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>What you learn from that route is very limited and dependant on the code you are reading. You wont learn proper oo concepts, understanding, design patterns, antipatterns, “tips &amp; tricks” (how to do things properly) and pitfalls. Being able to program is more than being able to modify code to get it to work, tho a purely academical approach is neither good. What you need is a balance, without it, you are just asking for trouble (inability to start own projects via the route that you went down, and so many other moparscapers, inability to debug code or design good apis etc etc).</p>
<p>So, as you said.</p>
<p>Fuck off. Don’t give advice if you don’t <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">know</span></span> Java yourself.</p>
<p>Personally I find any comment like that harsh, but considering you used it yourself… get what you give.[/quote]</p>
<p>I didn’t tell him how to learn, I told him how I learned and I’m rather happy with how far I’ve gotten. You’re right, you don’t pick up design patterns with this way of learning, but as you develop along you start reading more also, at least that’s what I did.</p>
