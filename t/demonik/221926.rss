<p>What you learn from that route is very limited and dependant on the code you are reading. You wont learn proper oo concepts, understanding, design patterns, antipatterns, “tips &amp; tricks” (how to do things properly) and pitfalls. Being able to program is more than being able to modify code to get it to work, tho a purely academical approach is neither good. What you need is a balance, without it, you are just asking for trouble (inability to start own projects via the route that you went down, and so many other moparscapers, inability to debug code or design good apis etc etc).</p>

<p>I didn’t tell him how to learn, I told him how I learned and I’m rather happy with how far I’ve gotten. You’re right, you don’t pick up design patterns with this way of learning, but as you develop along you start reading more also, at least that’s what I did.</p>

exactly, idk what this dude’s problem is. And btw, Mudclient.java, search for mc.createWindow(mc.windowWidth, mc.windowHeight + 11. Then change the name of the client fool.</p>

to peter and  sean: you may know it better than me, but i still know java, enough to tell people what is the best and FASTEST way to learn it. if people want to be idiots, and learn it slowly then thats fine but i thought people would want to learn it faster and actually understand it and what the code does.</p>
<p>nobody has the source anymore because its way too old. the oldest you will find is divinepk v5. can a mod please close this?[/quote]<br>
Your an idiot, how are you to tell people the FASTEST way to learn java just because you know java. Some people like to learn different ways, and perhaps your way will take 10x longer then their own way. Why don’t you just leave auroa alone and let him learn THE WAY HE WANTS TO LEARN. Why do you care so much? And I guarantee someone has the old demonik source.</p>

<p>Then how do you think people learn java so well? They start and start reading, and trying… Don’t say they don;t because they do.<br>
[/quote]not by reading java code, you will never get anywhere like that.</p>
<p>read a book on java, read a tutorial, learn the basics THEN look at java source code and start coding. thats how its done.[/quote]</p>
<p>Fuck off. Don’t give advice if you don’t know Java yourself.</p>
<p>Ugh learning a (programming) language is still learning, and people differ. Some people prefer to read a lot of books to get the knowledge and then start trying to get the experience. I myself started with browsing mIRC code. Reading other peoples scripts and simply using them until I figured out what part did what. The same with Java. Just pick the way you prefer to learn and stick with it.</p>
<p>Don’t have the demonik source anymore though, sorry.</p>

How would that be a favor rofl? I asked for the demonik source so i can start working from scratch slowly and you start saying all this shit about use the divine or rscd source and edit the xmls and xp rates. Saying people cant learn to code with java from learning source. Get your facts bro.</p>

<p>dam, i want a basic server that at least has the ability to run, because with all these new sources, you can’t really learn anything because you are so tempted just to edit the xmls or xp rates and release it.<br>

<p>Then how do you think people learn java so well? They start and start reading, and trying… Don’t say they don;t because they do.[/quote]not by reading java code, you will never get anywhere like that.</p>
<p>read a book on java, read a tutorial, learn the basics THEN look at java source code and start coding. thats how its done.</p>
