    <description>So I&#39;ve been playing this game for a couple days, and it&#39;s awesome.

[IMG height=500]http://i40.tinypic.com/9v8dat.jpg[/img]

I&#39;m really indecisive about it&#39;s look lmao, 3rd paint job and 4th vinyl job. Amazing drag racing vehicle. Worst handling ever right now, currently I&#39;m saving up for a camaro to be my next vehicle, it&#39;s $500,000 lol, hence the large amount of cash sitting up there. Chasing achievements and racing every chance I get.

It&#39;s a racing MMO, you can drive around and do the daily treasure hunts, drive around with friends, see others cars and stuff, etc. etc. Then you of course can race, to team police pursuit escapes, and also do single-player events.

If you end up trying out lemme know and we can race or something, it&#39;s an amazing game. It&#39;s free to play, forgot to mention that. It&#39;s not very pay2win, contrary to what people say you can only buy cars and cosmetic parts with the bought currency, and cars all have their own race classes so I won&#39;t get teamed up with a Ferrari or anything.

p.s Don&#39;t use the origin launcher, it&#39;s really, really buggy. Just download the one from their site.</description>

              <p>If it stops getting boring and you need a boost just hit up mpgh and grab some fun tools and go obliterate everyone in-game. I like it for the car customizing and sometimes racing with non-hackers, just depends really.</p>

<p>Looks pretty pay2win to me. I played it a while back but the fact that I knew that the things I worked for, others hadn’t worked for, put me off.</p>
