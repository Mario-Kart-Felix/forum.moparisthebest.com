    <title>Mid-low end computer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mid-low-end-computer/519750</link>
    <description>So, my parents are talking about getting me a laptop or desktop for my 19th birthday and I know that getting a desktop is more affordable in the long run because I can simply swap parts when I need to upgrade instead of buying a completely new desktop itself. I really don&#39;t want them to buy me another laptop although this one happens to be a 2007 vista.

I was wondering if you guys could help me (I don&#39;t know where to look other than newegg) in putting together a decent low to mid end desktop. I&#39;d like to help them budget around $500-600 simply because I don&#39;t have a job yet so I can&#39;t really look for anything too spectacular from them.

I&#39;d appreciate your help, I&#39;d rather not buy a build from Best Buy/Wal-Mart and risk being unable to upgrade anything in the future.</description>

<p>Those prices are INCREDIBLY cheap… Why are they so cheap in US?</p>

              <p>Thanks for the suggestions and links. I’ll check them out and discuss them with my parents. They’re not too technological when it comes to computers so they’re afraid of buying parts and would rather just buy complete builds.</p>

<p>Bestbuy has the same build for 10$ less.</p>
<p>Quad core - 610 graphics. Not the greatest in the world but can always be upgraded.</p>
<p>For an intel option:</p>
<p>I would probably suggest this</p>

<p>It’s just a tad more expensive but in the end well worth it.</p>

              <p>CPU-Intel I3(you decide the range) vs AMD FX-6300($100-120 range)<br>
MB-Asus M5A97 R2.0 ATX AM3+ Motherboard($85)<br>
Memory-Up to you. I would go with 8gb which is like $50 from kingston, but you could go down for cheaper.<br>
PSU- I’d go with 600/650W which is around $80-90.<br>
Video card- Sapphire Radeon HD 7770 1GB Video Card seems to be suggested, I’m not really sure on how great these are though as I always go with 660Ti’s.($125)<br>
Case’s and drives are cheap.</p>
<p>Here’s a few other builds I found that seem decent off a a great community I use. Feel free to search for more info.<br>
