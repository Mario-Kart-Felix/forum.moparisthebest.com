    <description>works just like the Unapproved Tutorials section. If someone&#39;s team is denied, they need to be notified.

You can optionally send them the following template when denying a team:

[code=bbc]The topic you recently submitted to the Development Teams section was declined because (it was/showed):

[ul][li]An advertisement[/li]
[li]Lack of development experience[/li]
[li]Unable to show any successful qualities[/li]
[li]Possibly not original work[/li][/ul]
 
Thanks for being eager to continue the development of private servers. However, we would ask that you next time follow the rules before reposting your team. This way your team can be accepted. ;)

<p>Well many people can just say they have something, but won’t prove it. If it is a decent thread and doesn’t contain proof, I will approve it but will tell them to post the development progress asap. Would that be alright?</p>

<p>Works for me. The teams section isn’t intended to be another “approve and ignore for the next two years” section. Since few topics will be let through, all topics will be monitored.</p>

<p>Pictures are not a requirement. They are one way for us to ensure that the work is original, but if they are not included, just use your discretion.</p>
