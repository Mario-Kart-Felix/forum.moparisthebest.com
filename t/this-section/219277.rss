    <description>Hey, as just being a clan section wasn&#39;t hauling in that many users I have decided to change this board to incorporate events as well as clans.

What this means is that if you are deciding to host a gaming event (A meet up, a demonstration etc etc) it will go in this section. It is my understanding that this will allow us to organize these events better and get a better turn out. So for example, as we had a swass sticka Runescape meet up that was set to take place a while ago and nobody turned up, we will now post that here.

So to summarize; What goes in this section:

[ul][li]Clan discussion &amp; recruitment[/li]
[li]Gaming events[/li][/ul]


Enjoy!</description>
