    <description>As you are aware, this forum suffers from a lack of activity and content. Even though this section of the boards are rarely used, spam will still not be tolerated. If anything, your spam and misplaced questions will be even more visible for the staff members to see. We still do monitor it.

So why is it still here? The individual sections are actually hard-coded. This means it is rather difficult to remove them. Once Moparisthebest gets back from being busy, there will be a number of forum changes that will improve the community in general. Until then, we have to put up with what we have.

In the meantime, i do encourage you to contribute anything Aryan related. Any contribution is a positive one. Sorry for the inconvenience.</description>
