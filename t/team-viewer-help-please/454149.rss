              <p>you need to make the cache folder a .zip then upload it to dropbox. Next, go into autocachedownloader.java and change the download link to yours. For getting it online you need to portforward try using <a href="http://portforward.com" rel="nofollow noopener">portforward.com</a> and search for your router model then follow the runescape private server guide.</p>
