    <description>Ok I edited a little in NPC.cfg and Autospawn.cfg.

First I opened NPC.cfg, and edited NPC ID 19 (White Knight).

I changed name to White_Knight_Guard, made combat from 36 to 90 and set health level to 250.

I go into Autospawn.cfg, add an spawn with NPC 19 at bottom and set coords to Varrock.

Ok, he spawns but name is still &quot;White Knight&quot;, level still 36 also is there a way to get him facing north?

Thanks in advance. Yes I searched and found only empty topics.

[b]Edit:[/b] I noticed health level does work.</description>

              <p>Changing combat level on the NPCs is client-sided I think. You can still change their cb lvl in npc.cfg, but it’ll still appear as the original level</p>
