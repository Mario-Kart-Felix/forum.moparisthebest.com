    <description>Alright well today I downloaded a clean 317 and I wanted to put an npc for shops and i got him spawned in with &quot;npcspawn&quot; but when I go to trade him nothing comes up so does anyone have the code where i can trade him? I used this code &quot;else if (NPCID == 531) { // Agnar Food Shop
PutNPCCoords = true;
WanneShop = 105 ; //Aubury Magic Shop
}&quot;       

But it didnt work so can anyone help? (If you need any more codes/info please let me know)</description>
