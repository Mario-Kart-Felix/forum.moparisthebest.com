    <title>Fucked up screen</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fucked-up-screen/235570</link>
    <description>I open up my laptop to turn it on about ten minutes ago and see this giant crack in the screen that wasn&#39;t there this morning. Nobody&#39;s been in my house all day except me, and I haven&#39;t messed with my laptop at all.

It&#39;s really weird. I was also wondering if the warranty on the laptop would cover physical damage such as this.</description>

              <p>You should be fine then with the warranty. I accidentally spilled coke all over my first school laptop a few summers ago, HP sent me a newer model completely free.</p>

<p>Yeah, it’s an HP. And along with this crack in the screen, no mouse buttons, and I need to get the laptop cleaned up diskwise.</p>
