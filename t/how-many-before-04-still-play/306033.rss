    <title>How many before 04 still play?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-many-before-04-still-play/306033</link>
    <description>I was wondering how many of us that started Runescape before 2004 still played.
I being one of them started around sept 03.

If you feel like sharing you&#39;re details on when you started and stuff post about it.</description>

<p>uhm, i don’t play as often anymore tbh, after that new quest for chiv/piety, i spent like, 4m on 62 pray, which basically dropped half my cash left from when i gave all my shit out a week before 3k update (the day jagex warned us to transfer a week ahead of time, because the update), was total of 492m i believe, either that or 392, i remember it was 92 at the end… then my friend quit and used all that cash pking, about a year after i “quit”. hilly luring fails tbh.<br>
then i got 99 cook, since that was my favorite skill since i started (only because i could have made a decent 30m+ from it back then, i can still make 10m from it now, but it’s slow).<br>
got my firecape at lvl 82(biggest fluke every tbh, but i won’t explainit).</p>
<p>uhhh yh…back to homework…</p>
