    <description>Hello guys,

Im about to make a second word in my rsps.

I have a VPS system with enough gb to host 4 worlds so can someone help me and tell me
how to make a diffrent world?

I already have builded a fully pvp source with save zones, pvp drops and everything.
I also have changed that port to 5555 so im hosting 2 servers (worlds) but you cant switch them.

I like to make:
A button behind &quot;Click here to Play!&quot; where you can switch your world loggin.
So if you click that button it switch to port 5555 if you click it again it switch to 43594.

how can i make that button?.. and also if you loggin in world 1 (main world) and you loggin on world 2 (pvp world) you loggin on the same place where you logged out on world 1, with the same items stats and everything.

Can anyone link me to a tut or tell me how to make this?
I know it isnt impossible.

also how can i change the file where my source loads the character files? like:

load chacater files from player at: &quot;./Data/characters/&quot; + playerName + &quot;.txt&quot; and so on. where can i change that so it works perfectly?

zerk p0wer

p.s. my server is PI</description>

              <p>Make another directory that loads depending on port.  For the button, just find the text for the click here to play, and instead of it going to the next chatbox, make it switch the client ports?</p>
