    <description>http://certification.comptia.org/getCertified/certifications/linux.aspx

After getting my A+ and Net+ and being hired in a full time tech support position, I am now going to start studying for the Linux+, which is a great cert, since it also gives you the LPIC1 and the Novell Certified Linux Administrator Certification (it&#39;s a three-in-one cert). 

Does anybody have any tips on learning the in and outs of Linux? What distributions are good for learning the command line, etc?</description>

</aside>
<p>I suggest doing the CCNA 200-120. Taking the test broken into two parts makes it a little more difficult in my opinion – they delve into a lot more specifics/fine details on the individual tests then they do on the full exam. With that being said, if you prepare the right way and actually familiarize yourself with the material you’ll have no problems regardless of the route you take to get the cert.</p>
<p>As a side note… Remember that its the knowledge behind the cert that counts and not the piece of paper that you’re awarded when you pass the test. So study hard and lab harder <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>The thing is, there are Cisco &amp; Juniper certifications that are far, far from entry level certifications. Especially with the CCIE and JNCIE, they’re people at the top of their industry, the exams are tough and the practical lab exams are just as difficult. People with those certifications are quite highly sought after (take a look for CCIE/JNCIE salaries).</p>
<p>I suspect when you talk about Cisco certifications you’re talking about the entry level CCENT and even the CCNA, they are common and they’re not that in-depth that they’d be providing you with all that unique of a skill set (or at all, really). At that position, they are just a nice to have - rather than a “this person has done these certifications”.</p>
<p>I work at a company with millions of £ on its networking budget a year, provides services for major UK companies, I have been able to go to various networking conferences, not just for Cisco, Juniper, but for others like Checkpoint (UG), and even non-networking companies like VMWare. I don’t think I’ve met anyone who could be deemed a professional at these places dismiss them as you have, and I’ve met people working at these huge companies with massive networks, talked with IBM engineers, HP engineers, Checkpoint engineers, even by companies in competition with Cisco and Juniper (like HP) they’re fairly well respected certifications as you climb up (from CCNP and up).</p>
<p>I’m not saying they’re absolutely necessary, but as you climb up as networker, especially if you’re not just an engineer, but someone involved in design and implementation you start to look like the odd one out if you don’t have these kind of certifications. They have a lot higher penetration than than the servers and infrastructure world.</p>
<p>The thing is, despite your scepticism regarding vendor specific certifications - and I’ve only gone through Cisco material - Cisco rarely ever present their proprietary solutions as the only option. They teach the standards, they mostly teach just pure networking - of course how to do it on a Cisco device, but they explain the theory, they explain it without the context of implementation too. That’s why they’re so common, because they’re also just useful vocational networking courses even if you’re not using Cisco equipment.</p>

<p>Interesting you’ve had a different experience to me in a relatively close geographic area tL. I always see the jobs asking for Cisco/Juniper experience (or something less specific) and often they say something along the lines of certs if no exp, or certs are desirable but not required providing you have the experience. If you contact them and ask the certs are as you say just a barrier for HR to cut down the huge number of applicants - just like requirement for a degree is often to weed out undesirables. They will still consider those with decent experience, you just apply directly to HR with a great cover letter - then you have to not be shit at interviews like me <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>I know quite a few high level network engineers that have either never had them or let them expire once they got the experience, but if work will pay its worth doing of course.</p>

That isn’t to say that they’re all bad - Cisco certification is an example of a good one, iirc. Just be aware of the fact that they aren’t universally ‘good’ or highly regarded.<br>

Do explain. You’ll struggle to find any network that isn’t underpinned by Cisco technology.</p>

<p>And again, but ESPECIALLY in the Linux Systems Administrator world, certs look good to HR but real managers/coworkers couldn’t give a damn about them.  In fact the majority of linux sys-admin jobs I see posted just look for X years of experiance.</p>

              <p>I took a Linux+ class through Mile2 a few months ago and overall it was pretty good. There is a ton to learn and theres no way you can do it without getting your hands dirty. I suggest installing a distro of your choice and just playing around with it. Find a book that has labs and follow them and expand on them if you get curious.</p>
<p>If you got the A+ and Net+ you’ll be able to handle this as well.</p>

              <p>My expertise lies elsewhere but I have taken UNIX/Linux courses and I’ve always found textbooks to be helpful. Browsing through my books I’d say my favorite is <a href="http://en75.tribalwars.net/human.php?s=14daa31f802e&amp;small" data-bbcode="true">Your UNIX/Linux: The Ultimate Guide, 3rd Edition</a>. As for a distribution that is good for familiarizing yourself with the command line it’s hard to say. There are a plethora of distributions but for learning I [size=7pt](this is just my personal opinion)[/size] would suggest CentOS, SUSE, or RHL/Fedora.</p>
<p>I’ve used Linux to host a variety of things and I’ve always used CentOS. For learning how to use the command line or kernel CentOS is my top pick but I would imagine most Linux kernels are quite similar. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>After getting my A+ and Net+ and being hired in a full time tech support position, I am now going to start studying for the Linux+, which is a great cert, since it also gives you the LPIC1 and the Novell Certified Linux Administrator Certification (it’s a three-in-one cert).</p>
<p>Does anybody have any tips on learning the in and outs of Linux? What distributions are good for learning the command line, etc?</p>
