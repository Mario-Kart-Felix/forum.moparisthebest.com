PICTURES WILL BE UP TOMMORROW WHEN I GET HOME FROM WORKING :)


Okay well the project has been going for a while now and were looking for some good people to join our Development Team, Our server will be very interactive with players once released, events, competitions, tournaments and more because we want to make the game more enjoyable for those who play and more enjoyable for the team. The server will be an all rounder (Good Pvp/pk, Minigames and skilling) but we want to keep a sustainable economy so no ::pickup commands or instant leveling will be included. Hopefully with the efforts of all members of the team Supremacy will achieve these things :)

Right now we have a great blank 508 starter source with many common bugs fixed included combat animations and working skill cape emotes and more. With lots of potential. But if you prefer any other 500+; 525, 562 for example then dont hesitate to mention that. Our current members can work with that as we&#39;ve been testing 562&#39;s in the past. :)

Things That Will Be Hopefully Added Later:
