    <title>[C#] How to Handle Multiple UDP Clients Effectively</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/c-how-to-handle-multiple-udp-clients-effectively/246202</link>
    <description>Hey everyone!

I decided to undertake a project of my own, making something vaguely resembling an MMORPG server, but I&#39;m trying to think of an effective way to recieve UDP packets (for player position, etc) from the clients.

I learned from RuneScape private servers that thread-per-client is not the way to go, because the context switching aspect is very hard on the server, and spawning tons of threads is not exactly beneficial to the performance of the application.

So, I&#39;m wondering how I can handle recieving packets from every connected client. Spawning threads is out, and therefore UdpClient.BeginRecieve() is out, so how can I do this?

Thanks for your help! :)</description>

<p>I’m going to tell you what i tell people who like to say how certain bytecode libraries are slow.</p>
<p>yes TCP is slower then UDP, but its still probably fast enough for your game.<br>
if its not fast enough, you can switch to UDP, but dont go choosing UDP only because of speed, when you havent even tried the speed out.</p>
<p>of course for extra speed, you could ditch UDP altogether and use the IP layer, its much faster because it doesnt waste time with port numbers and checksums.</p>
<p>and why even use a bytecode library? just edit a class file directly on the buffer.</p>

select()<br>
java has it, c# should have it<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Hm, select()? What’s that?[/quote]</p>
<p>i really nice way of waiting for many sockets at once, more elegant, uses less resources and simpler (most of the time) then forking, threading or OS signals.</p>
<p>its actually from the c language, but languages like java and c# have implemented wrappers.</p>

              <p>The main advantage of UDP is that it can be tailored to suit your precisse needs, so, with an appropiate design, a game could be reducing its latency and bandwith usage by a significant percent.</p>
<p>For example, for a spawn packet you would typically need at least a subset of the TCP features (sequenciality, reliability, etc), because it wouldn’t be fun if an invisible dragon killed the player because the packet that was meant to inform of its presence didn’t arrive.</p>
<p>However, a movement packet does not always need these features. If you send a couple position updates per second, and once in a while one of them doesn’t arrive, there isn’t really much harm done. Simply, the client won’t be able to predict the current server position of the player with the same precission for that particular moment. However, the majority of times, the server will actually receive more packets and with less latency than it would with TCP, so the overall accuracy and response time will be better.</p>

If you think about it, HTTP typically uses TCP…And you probably send more data in a standard request to page with a few images than you would by sending a few bytes for an mmorpg.</p>
