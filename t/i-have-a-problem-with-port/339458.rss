    <title>I have a problem with port</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-have-a-problem-with-port/339458</link>
    <description>Hello all.
I am new and I want to have my own server, but I can&#39;t.
I portforwarded, and did all things like this.
Then I sent it to my friend and he couln&#39;t connect.
So I tried to find the problem and I finally got it.
I went on canyouseeme.org and it says :

Error: I could not see your service on **.**.**.*** on port (43594)
Reason: Connection timed out

or

Error: I could not see your service on **.**.**.*** on port (43594)
Reason: Connection refused

So plz help me! :(</description>

<p>IT CANNOT FIND THE IP ADDRESS TO THAT PORT, SO THEORETICALLY SPEAKING, WHEN YOU PORT FOWARDED YOU TYPED IN THE WRONG ADDRESS FOR THAT PORT TO FOWARD TO.</p>
