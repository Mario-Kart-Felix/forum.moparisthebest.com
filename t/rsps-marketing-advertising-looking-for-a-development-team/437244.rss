<p>I wouldn’t need them, I already have an advertiser that managed to get his runescape forum in the top 10 on Google search for ‘runescape’ in a matter of weeks (above zybez, heh).</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, it doesn’t matter if your services are free. You’re advertising yourself either way not starting a <span class="bbcode-i">DEVELOPMENT</span> team. And you sound fishy, and someone that abuses the system to advertise at others expense.</p>
