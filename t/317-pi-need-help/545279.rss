    <description>Hello,

i want to change a few things or fix them:

1) Prayer
I want to change some sprites of prayer and i changed them but now if i see them in game with a white background, than i came with the solution to extract an other prayer image and than give my prayer sprites the same background but that didn`t work.

I want to write text in the square i made with paint, see pic below

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Options

My run is everytime 0% and if the button isn`t red what means that you are walking it is still running?
And my brightness doesn`t have a button or something if i login, but if i click lightest brightness i see it.
If i relog it keeps like that but than i close client and look at my brightness it is again like on the pic, see pic below

Peace
