    <title>Beste private server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/beste-private-server/171781</link>
    <description>Hello, I am just looking for a server to host for me and some friends to play on {about 16 of us all to gather} And I like most of the pk servers as they don&#39;t restrict ::pickup and such other&#39;s but I was wondering if there are any with working minigames {even if not 100% like the originals in rs AND uptodateish items such as godswords, defenders, vestiles and such? I tryed searching but most of the ones that look good have broken download links so if anyone helped me find a server thats not too bad on lagg, has decent minigames, a good amount of npc&#39;s and more recent items i would really really appreciate the help locating it. {My grammar isn&#39;t too well and I&#39;mm sorry for that.}</description>
