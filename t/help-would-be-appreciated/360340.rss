              <p>The same thing has happened to me man… I have personal messaged DuhPk he refuses to help anyone. So i guess we are in the same boat. Would you like to team up with me on this source. I’m looking for a partner to help me code.<br>
I went through and uncommented everything that was commented out also it doesnt work. So im going to try and rewrite the playerdeath codes.</p>
