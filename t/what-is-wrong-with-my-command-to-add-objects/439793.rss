It says its adding it, but it isn&#39;t adding my objects to the objects.cfg, nor does it save it to the map itself. Any help?</description>

<p>[quote=“Ashton51, post:2, topic:439793”]You can create a command that will write to the objects class adding a new object at the coordinates you are standing at.</p>
<p>That way you can walk around and use the command to permanently add an object to that spot, Meaning it will always spawn.[/quote]</p>
<p>I tried doing what you asked and made this:</p>
<p>[code]   	 else if (command.startsWith(“addOBJ”) &amp;&amp; playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(ServerCP.Owner)) {<br>
int newOBJECT = Integer.parseInt(command.substring(command.length + 1));<br>
try {<br>
BufferedWriter Writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("./data/cfg/objects.cfg", true));<br>
Writer.write(“spawn = “+newOBJECT+”	“+absX+”	“+absY+”	0	0	0	0	0	1”);<br>
Writer.newLine();<br>
Writer.flush();</p>
<pre><code>			sM(""+ GetObjectID(newOBJECT) +" was successfully added to your objects.cfg! ");
		} catch (IOException e) {
			e.printStackTrace():
		} finally {
			if (Writer != null) {
				try {
					Writer.close();
				} catch (IOException ioe2) {
					sM("An Error has occurred, the object did not save in your objects.cfg.");
				}

			}

<p>It says its adding it, but it isn’t adding my objects to the objects.cfg, nor does it save it to the map itself. Any help?</p>
