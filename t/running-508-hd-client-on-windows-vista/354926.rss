    <title>Running 508 hd client on windows vista</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/running-508-hd-client-on-windows-vista/354926</link>
    <description>hello i need help im pretty sure running hd client on windows vista is different than xp, because i had all things needed, cache508, hd server, hd client, .titana_cache_32, titana is put in :C/, but i still get error ... can anyone help ?
----------------------------------------------------------------EDIT
i did research and what i have accomedated is that .titana_cache_32 is not supported by windows vista, thus meaning Running HD Client/Server is prohibited? Is this true, if so please tell me if isn&#39;t than please tell me what cache i need.</description>
