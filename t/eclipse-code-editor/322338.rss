    <title>Eclipse; Code editor</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/eclipse-code-editor/322338</link>
    <description>So i noticed that everyone was either using notepad or Microsoft word to edit their coding (well most of the ppl) so i decided to show everyone Eclipse and how to use it.
[b]CREDITS GO TO ECLIPSE[/b]

Alright so first let me explain what Eclipse is: Eclipse is a program used to compile run order debug and write your code. It organizes all classes and all the parts inside of them.

First step to Eclipse is obviously the download: [url=http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/]http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[/url] there are different types of eclipse but all of them pretty much do the same thing you need to dl the files to your C: drive. 

So once you&#39;ve downloaded eclipse open it up it should look something like this [img]http://i49.tinypic.com/ei5ojk.jpg[/img]

Now the lay out may look confusing but its quite easy press the green button that looks like a play button to run; it compiles when you press run. To debug your program click debug which is at the top right of the screen . 
Also when you are writing code it will highlight the errors in red and all you have to do is run over it with your mouse and it will tell you whats wrong. So lets open up a client.java in eclipse and see what happens [IMG]http://i47.tinypic.com/x4lxfd.jpg[/img]

as you can see it organizes everything so what your looking for is easily found! 

thats it if you have any other questions dont hesitate to ask me
