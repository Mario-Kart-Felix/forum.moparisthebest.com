    <title>RGB/HSV/etc</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rgb-hsv-etc/385398</link>
    <description>So, I was wondering, and I&#39;m not sure if anyone knows the answer, how does RGB/HSV work in terms of taking a hex value and displaying the color? Is there different frequencies or whatever the term would be that defines how bright the pixel is and whatnot?

Also, what&#39;s the difference between HSV and RGB? Is there more color models out there?

Irrelevant, but, the reason I ask is because I wanted to write something in JavaScript that converts, over the course of a few minutes, the background color of a page from white to black without using some sort of static array of HEX values, but rather converting HSV to RGB. There poses different tactical advantages and disadvantages towards converting HSV or just using RGB itself, one cool thing I liked about HSV is that it only changes one value (V) to modify the darkness.</description>

              <p>rgb just encodes the brightness of the red, green and blue colors individually since pixels are just clusters of r,g,b anyway<br>
the benefit of using hex to encode it is that each color fits in 2 digits, ie 0xRRGGBB</p>

              <p>In terms of conversion and whatnot, <a href="http://beesbuzz.biz/code/hsv_color_transforms.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> is a good resource. There are certainly more color models (ie: CIELAB, or recently CIECAM02). Personally for this I would just use RGB… I don’t know why you would think that you need a static array of hex values for what you’re up to.</p>
