That source may be hard for a new coder… it’s kinda empty in my opinion. But, whatever. When you start, I think its better to just learn the basics, changing text, moving and adding npc’s, making npc’s talk, adding drops all the real basic than… This would be a perfect source.<br>
[/quote]Well… I have no clue what that source is <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> So, I’ll just stick with what I said before (Even though I’m sure this guy hasn’t waited this long to get a source.) Allstar-Scape would probably be the best source to get you started.</p>
<p>Anyone wanting to learn should be opting to use Yz85Racer’s base as a guide to get started with, without having to do all the I/O and client managing on their own.[/quote][br][br][size=1]Posted on: January 31, 2009, 12:13:49 am[/size][hr]Ha, that last one I posted was screwed up, but I think you get my point.

              <p>Yeah allstar would be best, working ::ipban command, easy and simple coding. If you consider figment, I suggest you dont because Ip banning doesnt work.
