    <description>Hi guys,
ive got two things :/

Number one :

ive added zaryte bow,
but now its training strength instead of range 
do you guys know how to change it ?

Number two :

ive saw in my quest tab that it said i had owner rights,
so i went to my source &gt; data &gt; characters but the file said its player right was 0,
