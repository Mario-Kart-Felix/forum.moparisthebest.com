    <description>Yeh, I&#39;ve been trying to make a server, after 2 years break, new computer and everything. I can&#39;t remember anything about this and so..

So, i guess my classpaths are messed up or something. But always when i try to run any client it says &quot;Could not find the main class: Gui&quot; or &quot;Could not find the main class: Server&quot; or w/e it is. I know what is wrong, it can&#39;t find it, cuz the paths are fucked.

Please help ;)</description>
