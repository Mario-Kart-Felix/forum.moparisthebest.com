    <description>I&#39;m sure there already is a topic on this, but what ever.

What are your thoughts on &quot;weed&quot;. Do you smoke it? Have you tried it before? Do you enjoy smoking it? Have you ever got caught smoking it by a family member? etc.

Weed doesn’t affect me. My cousins smoke near daily, and I smoke with them. On 4/20, I try my hardest to get any feeling whatsoever. This last time, I smoked 4 bowls, and 3 blunts myself. After the first 2 bowls, everyone was faded. I kept going just to see if I have a high tolerance, but I still didn’t feel any different.<br>

<p>Your probably not smoking it properly… Puff and then inhale air and hold it in as long as you can… Thats what gets you fucked up…</p>

<p>You would have to smoke over 20,000 joints in less then 20 minutes to die from weed… Which is inhuman.</p>
<p>Also in every 1500 joints you smoke you get the toxian’s in 1 cigarette… Or is is 15,000?</p>

<p>I’m kind of the same way, id rather get high alone, and then spend my time learning (space, or anything) on the computer. And I try to limit it to before bed time only, so that I’m not a lazy burn-out during the day or around people.</p>
<p>My dad drinks tea at night to relax and read his newspapers. I like to smoke some weed and chill on the computer. Same deal exactly.</p>

From my last posts on weed, I’m not saying I don’t like it, I just don’t have the time for it. I beleive that it should be legal from all the research that proves it less harmful then alcohol. Ever see a high person go home and beat his wife and kids? No? Exactly. The worst you will do is try to eat your couch cause you think its a huge marshmallow.<br>
[/quote]<br>
The reason its not legal is because it would cost more money to regulate than they would generate in taxes, its easy for weed to be tainted with cocain and other drugs in order to get you hooked.[/quote]<br>
Thats all fine and everything but its not the whole picture, the plant has tons of other uses that would far out way the negatives and could also solve our dependency on foreign oil. Bio diesel made from the plant (other then the bud) gives out the same amount of oxygen when growing as carbon dioxide it releases when burning (equal levels don’t cause the green house effect). Along the thousands of other things it can be used for it makes very cheep paper which would save millions if not billions of trees each year which would help reverse the green house effect also.</p>

              <p>From my last posts on weed, I’m not saying I don’t like it, I just don’t have the time for it. I beleive that it should be legal from all the research that proves it less harmful then alcohol. Ever see a high person go home and beat his wife and kids? No? Exactly. The worst you will do is try to eat your couch cause you think its a huge marshmallow.</p>

              <p>Did it once, was really relaxing and everything was funny but was still a big waste of time overall, I can’t stand doing anything that isn’t productive other than games (jog my inspiration for art) and sleeping. If its legalized ill probably do it again every now and then, but alone while I do graphics and not playing UNO lol.</p>

You need to realize this right now:<br>
There’s a lot of people doing nothing with their life that smoke weed all day. Do they do nothing with their life because of the weed? Or do they smoke weed, since they are already doing nothing with their life. It’s the latter.[/quote]</p>
<p>you can’t make generalizations such as that, as i’m quite positive numerous users are doing nothing with their life because of the substance itself. i do agree, however, that many others are smoking because they are already doing nothing with their life.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@topic</span>:<br>
i don’t smoke weed as i’ve stated before, but it’s puerile to argue whether weed is harmful or not to one’s well-being, especially here, so don’t argue if you don’t have any prior and/or sufficient knowledge. (not targeting one specific member)</p>

<p>Also on the teacher note, they make more then the normal American :/[/quote]Not always true, it depends on if it is a private/public school, the grade, the degree level, the experience, the location, the population, the expected amount of work, the type of class that would be taught, the actual need for a teacher, what type of organization the school/daycare is, if the school is funded via the State, etc.</p>
