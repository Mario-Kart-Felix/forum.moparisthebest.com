<p>I sent them a support ticket for the same thing, the answer:</p>
<blockquote>Dear Customer,
<p>Thanks for your email. Due to a change in Paypal policies, we are not able to transfer your Onebip funds into your Paypal account.</p>
<p>In this moment only way to withdraw money is bank account.<br>
Onebip is working to improve its payment terms and will update as soon as new terms will be released.</p>
<p>We do apologize for this inconvenience.</p>
<p>To be eligible for withdrawal you need to receive at least one payment.</p>
<p>To collect your funds via bank transfer, add your bank account details to your Onebip profile:</p>
<p>a) Log into your Onebip account<br>
b) Select Manage - Bank Accounts<br>
c) Click on the “Add Bank” button and complete the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bank account owner name and last name</li>
<li>Iban code (if applicable)</li>
<li>Bank account number (not required if you have a IBAN code)</li>
<li>Bank name</li>
<li>Address (Personal)</li>
<li>Bank city</li>
<li>SWIFT/BIC code</li>
</ul>
<p>Onebip automatically transfers your funds to your bank account after 60 days from end of the month. For bank transfers the minimum amount is € 200.<br>
Withdrawals are processed the first day of each month. If you don’t reach the minimum sales amount within that day, your payments will be processed the following month.</p>
<p>You will collect funds 60 days after your withdrawals will have the “Processing” status in your Onebip account.</p>
<p>To avoid delays, please make sure your bank account details have been inserted correctly in your Onebip account.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to contact us for additional information.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br>
Onebip Support Team</p>

<p>OneBip is awful, it took 4 months to receive the money and when I did I only received 40% of it… So lets say I earned £1,000, I’d only receive £400. That’s AFTER all the fees when receiving each payment individually as well.</p>
<p>I’ll never use them again.</p>
