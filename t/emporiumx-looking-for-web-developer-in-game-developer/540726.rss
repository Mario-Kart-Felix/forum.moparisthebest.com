    <description>hello, my names sky.. i am the owner of a server called emporiumX we are a 718/742 rsps. We currently are in need of a developer who is both experienced with in game coding 718/742 and also good with forums such as mybb. we currently have 2 developers and are looking to spend about 2-5 weeks in beta stages and testing untill we get the server up and going. some server background information.. we used to host back in 2013 we had a active player base of about 35-40 on at a time.. but we could no longer fund the server at a point. and now we have decided to start back up the project with a new developer who can help get more things done in a small time. thank you for reading all this i hope it wasnt too much if you, have read this and meet the qualifications (good with web developing) and (in game developing) [size=10pt]please feel free to contact me on skype @ Purecoolbow1[/size]</description>

              <p>Right <span class="hashtag">#1</span> Consider your server revision. I only code up to 474 because any higher and the server is bullshit.<br>
(I like to play the game as well as code for it)</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#2</span> Stop with all this background information shit, im getting tired of proving my self to everyone that i’m trying to help out.<br>
Why the hell would i even try and apply for a coding position if i didn’t already know what i’m doing.<br>
(and don’t even try and mention stealing a source! thats a plain load of bollocks.)</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#3</span> If you can do these two things i’d be happy to code your server, website, client or even host your server…<br>
I’ve made 100’s in the past but i don’t have the patience to build up a player base and cant be arsed with all the advertising.</p>
