    <description>Is there any way besides trial and error to know how much RAM and CPU cores and bandwidth an RSPS will need to run and never crash?</description>

<p>Plus… ++ They’re not TRUE RSPS developer if they simply leech.[/quote]<br>
Yeah you’re assuming that because you’re freaking stupid. How does that work exactly? Making a server from scratch takes a lot of work so you assume I’m automatically lying? We’ve proved that we aren’t lying before, on our moparscape advertisement topic actually, and the retard who accused us admitted we were right in the end. He sounded a lot like you do now. And memory leaks aren’t exactly easy to prevent on a server with that much given code, not for a bunch of teenagers, anyway. Of course it’s easy to accidentally do it yourself.</p>
<p>And programming and coding are the exact same thing, WHO CARES. Now I know for a fact you’re full of shit, because you play little semantics games to make yourself seem smart. I’ve seen people say that before, and they knew pretty much nothing about coding, or I’m sorry, “programming”. Get off your high horse, bub. I know how to program and so does Kane. I’d be happy to show you some of the code for 2D game engines I’ve written all by myself, no Unity or other external game engines. As a matter of fact, I’d be willing to show that to prove anyone here who doubts me or Kane. Give me a shout if you think I’m full of shit, or just assume I’m lying because it “takes a lot of skill” like The Web Guy. I’d love to publicly embarrass you.</p>
<p>P.S. I hate how everyone immediately assumes that making a server from scratch is impossible. There’s a freaking Wikipedia page for all the 317 server protocol! If you know intermediate Java, you can do it, it’s not impossible. It’s not like we have to come up with our own engine, we literally just wrote all the code ourselves to follow the protocol that Jagex used. Not that hard, just tedious.</p>

<p>You did it wrong, then.[/quote]<br>
No shit genius. Why the hell do you think I posted this topic? I was having server trouble with OUR server; a server Kane and I DID code from scratch. I didn’t know what the problem was exactly, so I assumed it was an inferior VPS hosting plan, but I was wrong as this topic reveals. Some of the honest people here were willing to point out a problem I hadn’t thought of, the memory leak. The problem was solved, or at least identified, and I thought we were going to move on.</p>
<p>Oh and Whackatre, thanks for your tiny hint, but our server doesn’t run off a GUI, so no desktop environment. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

You don’t need 1GB ram on a Linux VPS, so even using 256mb is more then enough. If anybody wants I can make a tutorial on how to run a server on those VPS’s.</p>
<p>Even so, you can get a GUI with Linux.</p>

<p>I think one of those tutorials would be beneficial. A lot of people don’t know how, go for it.</p>

You guys have any other ideas as to what might cause the leak? Our RSPS is still in a heavy development stage, so we haven’t really advertised it big yet, so really there’s almost no-one using it. So I’d stray away from theories that suggest high traffic is the problem.<br>

If you’re using eclipse:<br>

It’s a Java Heap analyzer, helps find leaks.[/quote]<br>
It seems like this is exactly what I’m looking for, but using this is effectively confusing the hell out of me. Thanks for that regardless.</p>

</aside>
<p>Pretty much what he said. Why do you think they’re so much cheaper? I’ve used shitty web hosts and VPSs before, and I definitely regret going for the cheapest option.</p>
<p>Anyways, even if I don’t find out how to fix the memory leak, an auto-restarter will do just fine. I’d say this is settled, thanks everyone.</p>

              <p>[quote=“xEthanx, post:15, topic:542776”]It’s likely a problem with the code but it’s definitely not the theory you mentioned. Even if no one logs on the whole day it still crashes.</p>
<p>And with the link you gave, those prices aren’t really cheap for the given specs. I would need their professional plan to match what I currently have, which costs $18/month if I go with them. So not really worth making the transition - plus I have no idea how well the performance will be.[/quote]</p>
<p>You’re going to need to find out the problem. Your server won’t get far with it crashing every now and again. One problem could lead to another so like sk8rdude461 said, mat would be useful.</p>
<p>As for the VPS, it was the first one I found on Google, and $8 for 1GB really expensive?<br>
Here’s another link I found selling 1GB for $7 <a href="https://dotvps.co/virtual-servers.php" rel="nofollow noopener">https://dotvps.co/virtual-servers.php</a></p>

<p>You guys have any other ideas as to what might cause the leak? Our RSPS is still in a heavy development stage, so we haven’t really advertised it big yet, so really there’s almost no-one using it. So I’d stray away from theories that suggest high traffic is the problem.</p>

It’s a Java Heap analyzer, helps find leaks.</p>
