    <description>b4 anyone says use the search i just wanted to let ppl know that i did and i couldnt find anything...now getting to the point of this topic. Ok what im trying to do is get my forums online so ppl can register and post and what not. im using rscd source. ive done this before like 8months ago so i still remember some of it but not all of it. what i have done is i deleted all the files out of the cache folder then i went into phpmyadmin and manually entered my global ip and saved it. then i loaded my forums page logged in and went to the admin part and changed the ip under options. when i try to get on the forums by typing in my global ip it just says &quot;opps link doesnt exist&quot; or something like that...is there something i did wrong or can anyone help me figure this out?</description>
