    <title>ABS Brakes are shit</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/abs-brakes-are-shit/384090</link>
    <description>Recently I had my ABS brakes &quot;fixed&quot; in my 2004 Chevy Blazer. Today i&#39;m driving home from work and the abs light is blinking on and off randomly and the brakes are grinding. I stop turn off the vehicle, put it in park, and  restart it. Same thing. 

I come to the first stop sign I approach on the way home and when I press down the brakes the grinding continued and I didn&#39;t even SLIGHTLY get slowed down. So now i&#39;m thinking what the fuck my brakes are obviously messed up. Restarted the vehicle again in hopes I can at least get home. I turn onto the last road before my house and the ABS light, and the Parking brake light both come on and entirely lock up my brakes.  Slid into a ditch, hit a tree and continued sideways into a field.

Luckily I was only going 30 MPH at the time, but it still pisses me off that not even a month ago I had my brakes worked on. It pretty well fucked up my bumper, hopefully I can get this paid for by my insurance or the retarded brake service.</description>

              <p>Got back my vehicle this morning, they defiantly wanted to keep my business. They fixed the 3 broken sensors (both front wheels and back left wheel), put on a different bumper, oil change, and a transmission clean. Charged me 27 dollars in parts. For the sensors I presume. So basically it all didn’t turn out so bad.</p>

<p>ABS is an all time thing, Its not like you can just “turn it off” or you wouldn’t have any brakes. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>They usually do pretty good with my other problems. But they “fixed” these brakes not even a month ago. They admitted to doing something wrong, and said they’d fix it for free.</p>

              <p>ABS increases stopping distance, but it allows you to keep control.</p>
<p>I have owned my toyota for 10 months, done like 15,000km and the only things I have had to do is replace the clutch (was f’ed when I bought the car), replace some tires (were fairly crap when I got them), and give it oil changes. Brakes are mint, suspension is a bit tired, gearbox is a little noisy in a few gears - requires double clutching, motor runs like new. I say they car is pretty good for having 312500km and being 24 years old.</p>

<p>[quote=“jme, post:2, topic:384090”]I got new rotors and brake pads recently. He ordered the rotors from somewhere, and I supplied him with ceramic brake pads. I had ceramic brake pads on before and they were quiet, but this time when he installed them they were horribly loud. I waited a few weeks to see if it would go away and it didn’t, so the garage put on some silicone pads for free. Well then I dont know what they did, but I drive away from the garage and my NEW rotors are warped and the pads are louder then ever. He replaces the rotors for free, again, then of course they are fucking warped within a week and he’s not willing to fix it this time. So I went through 2 sets of rotors and brake pads, within a few weeks.</p>
<p>Unrelated to your topic, but I felt like ranting too. All I want are some working brakes. I shouldn’t have to pay a lot of money, have them fail twice, and then not even get a refund afterwards. There’s only like 1 or 2 saab dealers in Canada, and they are way too far away from me.[/quote]<br>
There is a specific break-in procedure you have to follow with ceramic brake pads (supplied by the manufacturer of your brake pads), or they will squeal like a pig and warp your rotors, regardless they are very loud for the first 500-1000 miles, you just have to deal with it.</p>

              <p>Recently I had my ABS brakes “fixed” in my 2004 Chevy Blazer. Today i’m driving home from work and the abs light is blinking on and off randomly and the brakes are grinding. I stop turn off the vehicle, put it in park, and  restart it. Same thing.</p>
<p>I come to the first stop sign I approach on the way home and when I press down the brakes the grinding continued and I didn’t even SLIGHTLY get slowed down. So now i’m thinking what the fuck my brakes are obviously messed up. Restarted the vehicle again in hopes I can at least get home. I turn onto the last road before my house and the ABS light, and the Parking brake light both come on and entirely lock up my brakes.  Slid into a ditch, hit a tree and continued sideways into a field.</p>
<p>Luckily I was only going 30 MPH at the time, but it still pisses me off that not even a month ago I had my brakes worked on. It pretty well fucked up my bumper, hopefully I can get this paid for by my insurance or the retarded brake service.</p>
