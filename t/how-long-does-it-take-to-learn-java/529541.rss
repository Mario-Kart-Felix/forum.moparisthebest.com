    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-java/529541</link>
    <description>Hey guys, this might seem like a stupid question, I know, but I just wanted to know how long it takes to learn Java. And I don&#39;t mean like college degree level, but I just mean good enough to be considered a &quot;Programmer,&quot; such as being able to make your own RSPS from an empty base, make whatever you want for example, custom bosses, equipment, game modes, etc. all by yourself. And the type of learning I&#39;m talking about is learning from people, websites, brochures, books, etc. I just want to know your opinion on how long it would take to learn Java, and tell me how long it took you to learn it (if you are a &quot;Programmer&quot;).

Sincerely,

LunarParadise

EDIT: I have just began learning the Java basics, and am almost done with learning about Operators. I am hoping to get very good within the next year, wish me luck. Please feel free to post how long it took you, and how you did it, as that will still help me  ;D

Cheers,

A professional told me it took him 2 years to understand every aspect of java as its a strongly coded language. You have to work at it over time and progress as you go. Never give up amateur programmers!</p>

Serious, there are so many libraries and things you can do with a language that it is impossible to learn everything in a lifetime.<br>
Well depends on how much life you have of course.</p>

In my opinion this is the most informative post in this thread; there really is no defined answer.</p>
<p>Granted I don’t remember most of the programming I learned when I was younger, but in my <span class="bbcode-b">personal</span> experience the most effective method of learning was to learn the concepts behind the language, and how programming employs it. Especially in a lang like Java, learn basic programming principals, i.e oop, etc and then learn the syntax which applies it. Once you learn the concept of programming methods, it merely becomes a matter of applying the certain syntax.</p>
<p>i.e spend 2-3 months learning basic principals of programming, then start applying syntax to it (in your case, Java).</p>

<p>o.O I have a feeling you haven’t been trying too hard.</p>
<p>If you dedicate yourself it should only take a few months (6-7) to get comfortable. Grab some tea and sit down and read the tutorials thoroughly, no skimming. If you don’t know what a word means, just look it up, takes about 2 seconds. Don’t move on in the tutorials unless you fully understand and grasp what you read, you may have to look at examples or watch video tutorials to explain it in a way you understand, and also, don’t give up or get frustrated.</p>
<p>Also, it helps quite a bit to type and work out problems and examples while reading them in the tutorials.</p>

              <p>Everyone learns at a different rate, the best way to learn the language is to learn the syntax of the language first, it’s also important to get to know the many concepts the language employs. Oracle provides all all information one would need about Java, it also helps if you’re apart of programming communities that can provide you with some aid when you get stuck!</p>

              <p>Hey guys, this might seem like a stupid question, I know, but I just wanted to know how long it takes to learn Java. And I don’t mean like college degree level, but I just mean good enough to be considered a “Programmer,” such as being able to make your own RSPS from an empty base, make whatever you want for example, custom bosses, equipment, game modes, etc. all by yourself. And the type of learning I’m talking about is learning from people, websites, brochures, books, etc. I just want to know your opinion on how long it would take to learn Java, and tell me how long it took you to learn it (if you are a “Programmer”).</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>LunarParadise</p>
<p>EDIT: I have just began learning the Java basics, and am almost done with learning about Operators. I am hoping to get very good within the next year, wish me luck. Please feel free to post how long it took you, and how you did it, as that will still help me  ;D</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
LunarParadise</p>
