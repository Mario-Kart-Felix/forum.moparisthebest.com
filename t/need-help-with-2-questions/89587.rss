    <description>I need help really badly with these:  :confused:

Question 1: How do i make safespots for a PK server?

Question 2: How do i make my own commands? (Example, ::starter, ::barrows, etc, etc)
But i want to make my own like..[EXAMPLE, ::waterdog] and maybe that command will take you to the oceon and give you a whip..Something like that! Just so i can make my own. And make a effect on the command.

If these could both be answered i would be very happy!

Thank-you.
