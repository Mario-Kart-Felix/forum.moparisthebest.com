    <title>Armour or Item signing? Would be cool!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/armour-or-item-signing-would-be-cool/514859</link>
    <description>So what if Runescape added something where you people can sign armour or items, and then you could trade them so when you examine it or what not it would say signed by Zezima or whoever themselves!

Maybe only 1 signature can be on the item at a time, you can remove the signature or sign it yourself.

If some noob who sold this item to you decided to sign it themselves you can just remove it, but now if you have a famous pker, legend, top player, or a player you look up to sign it, then I think that&#39;s where it would be cool.

When your trading in the trade you would also be able to see who its signed by before you purchase it of course.

If I had a Dark bow signed by Lord Makup I think I would like it.

I think its a pretty cool idea..</description>

It’s like the shitty WoW thing that says “Item Made By”, why can’t we have that too while we’re at it?<br>
[/quote]Why is that shitty? You’d know who was producing all of items, which could maybe link to gold farmers/heavy botters?[/quote]Uhh… how could that link to it at all? Legit players can make plenty of materials to sell as well, and I doubt any one person would buy enough to possibly try and find anything suspicious. Even then, if Jagex wanted to keep track of that, they could easily without adding some pointless text on an item. It just takes us screen space, and doesn’t provide anything useful to the player. I guess I’m just trying to figure out the use of this at all. If I buy an item, I don’t want it to be signed.</p>
<p>For those that have read the Harry Potter books, it’s like the goblin way of doing business. It’s the way of thinking that because you had the item at one point or made it you deserve to have your name all over it like it’s somehow still linked to you. Well you don’t, someone bought it and it’s theirs now.</p>
<p>However, what I think OP meant was not signing an item yourself that you made/got dropped, but getting someone famous to sign it so you can ‘prove you saw them’. While I think that’s extremely pointless and fanboyish, the easiest way to do this would be to create a new vanity item (“signature sheet”) or something so you can show people who you have met, instead of defacing actual useful items.</p>

              <p>So what if Runescape added something where you people can sign armour or items, and then you could trade them so when you examine it or what not it would say signed by Zezima or whoever themselves!</p>
<p>Maybe only 1 signature can be on the item at a time, you can remove the signature or sign it yourself.</p>
<p>If some noob who sold this item to you decided to sign it themselves you can just remove it, but now if you have a famous pker, legend, top player, or a player you look up to sign it, then I think that’s where it would be cool.</p>
<p>When your trading in the trade you would also be able to see who its signed by before you purchase it of course.</p>
<p>If I had a Dark bow signed by Lord Makup I think I would like it.</p>
<p>I think its a pretty cool idea…</p>
