<p>No, it was the right decision. His foot dragged along the ground to the line and after it had touched the line that was when it left the ground and this was before he placed the ball down for a try, so yeah, it shouldn’t have been allowed.</p>

from that angle of the camera it was hard to see if it was on the line or over it or not.<br>
From the other angle you can clearly see it was over the line.</p>

Before i watched this match i didn’t even know how the game was played.<br>
Well anyways i went to the pub for the first time today (idk why they were letting like everybody in) and was watching it, felt good to be shouting abuse at the screen with a lode of drunk 40 year old no-lifers.</p>
<p>Too bad we lost though. It was obvious that they were going to win though.<br>

I dont play sports at school, i find it a waste of time as i am not doing gcse p.e. (Although i do enjoy playing sports, the sports at my school consists of doing assault corses which are just tiring and not my cup of tea;))</p>
