    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creativescape-client-shard/415187</link>
    <description>hello i have been working on a shard source for a while now as i love the stability, basically i saw the creativescape release contained a better newer client, I was just wondering if anyone could offer me a hand in changing the client background as i am extreme novice when it comes to shard clients lol..
  If you dont want to help please dont comment as flaming-trolling will be ignored as i think its pointless as im simply asking one question nooby or not i need to know ,

thankyou
