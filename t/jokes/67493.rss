              <p>A blind man wanders into an all girls biker bar by mistake. He finds his way to a bar stool and orders some coffee. After sitting there for a while, he yells to the waiter, “Hey, you wanna hear a blonde joke?”</p>
<p>The bar immediately falls absolutely silent. In a very deep, husky voice, the woman next to him says, "Before you tell that joke, sir, I think it is only fair – given that you are blind – that you should know five things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The bartender is a blonde girl with a baseball bat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bouncer is a blonde girl.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m a 6 foot tall, 175 lb. blonde woman with a black belt in karate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The woman sitting next to me is blonde and a professional weightlifter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lady to your right is blonde and a professional wrestler.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, think about it seriously, Mister. Do you still wanna tell that joke?"</p>
<p>The blind man thinks for a second, shakes his head, and mutters, “No, not if I’m gonna have to explain it five times.”</p>

              <p>A lawyer defending a man accused of burglary tried this creative defense: “My client merely inserted his arm into the window and removed a few trifling articles. His arm is not himself, and I fail to see how you can punish the whole individual for an offense committed by his limb.” “Well put,” the judge replied. “Using your logic, I sentence the defendant’s arm to one year’s imprisonment. He can accompany it or not, as he chooses.” The defendant smiled. With his lawyer’s assistance he detached his artificial limb, laid it on the bench, and walked out.</p>

              <p><span class="bbcode-b">Last Day on the Job</span><br>
It was the mailman’s last day on the job after 35 years of carrying the mail through all kinds of weather to the same neighborhood.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the first house on his route he was greeted by the whole family there, who congratulated him and sent him on his way with a big gift envelope.</p>
<p>At the second house they presented him with a box of fine cigars.</p>
<p>The folks at the third house handed him a selection of terrific fishing lures.</p>
<p>At the fourth house he was met at the door by a strikingly beautiful woman in a revealing negligee.</p>
<p>She took him by the hand, gently led him through the door, and led him up the stairs to the bedroom where she blew his mind with the most passionate love he had ever experienced.</p>
<p>When he had had enough they went downstairs, where she fixed him a giant breakfast, eggs, potatoes, ham, sausage, blueberry waffles, and fresh squeezed orange juice.</p>
<p>When he was truly satisfied she poured him a cup of steaming coffee.</p>
<p>As she was pouring, he noticed a dollar bill sticking out from under the cup’s bottom edge. “All this was just too wonderful for words,” he said, “but what’s the dollar for?”</p>
<p>“Well,” she said, “last night, I told my husband that today would be your last day, and that we should do something special for you. I asked him what to give you.”</p>
<p>He said, “Fuck him, give him a dollar.”</p>
<p>The lady then said, “The breakfast was my idea.”</p>
<p>Lol  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> here’s another one</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">You’ve got mail, the blonde version.</span></p>
<p>A blonde keeps walking down her drive to her mail box.</p>
<p>She keeps doing this until her neighbour asks her why she is doing that.</p>
<p>The blonde replies “My computer keeps telling me that i’ve got mail”.</p>

<p>No, Windows is not a virus. Here’s what viruses do:</p>
<p>1.They replicate quickly - okay, Windows does that.</p>
<p>2.Viruses use up valuable system resources, slowing down the system as they do so - okay, Windows does that.</p>
<p>3.Viruses will, from time to time, trash your hard disk - okay, Windows does that too.</p>
<p>4.Viruses are usually carried, unknown to the user, along with valuable programs and systems. - Sigh… Windows does that, too.</p>
<p>5.Viruses will occasionally make the user suspect their system is too slow (see 2) and the user will buy new hardware. - Yup, Windows does that, too.</p>
<p>Until now it seems Windows is a virus but there are fundamental differences: Viruses are well supported by their authors, are running on most systems, their program code is fast, compact and efficient and they tend to become more sophisticated as they mature.</p>
<p>So Windows is not a virus.</p>
<p>It’s a bug.</p>
