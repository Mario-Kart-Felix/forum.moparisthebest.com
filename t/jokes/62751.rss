    <description>Three blondes are stuck on a desert island and one finds a magic lamp. They rub it and a genie pops out and gives them each a wish. the first blonde says, &quot;I wish I was 10% smarter so I could get off of this island.&quot; Then she turns into a redhead and swims off the island. The second sees what happens and says &quot;I wish I was 25% smarter so that I can get off this island!&quot; She then turns into a brunette, makes a raft from trees and sails off. Finally, the third blonde says &quot;I wish I was 50% smarter so I can get off this island.&quot; She then suddenly turns into a man and walks across the bridge. 
  Hehehehehe  :D :D :D

<p>So the genie turns to the third guy and says “now what is your wish”?<br>
The guy guy says, “You mean to tell me there are no nigger, spics or jews anymore”<br>
