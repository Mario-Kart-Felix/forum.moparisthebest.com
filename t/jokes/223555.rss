Bill Clinton, George Bush and George Washington were on the Titanic.
As the boat was sinking, George Washington heroically shouts, &#39;&#39;Save the women!&#39;&#39;

George Bush hysterically screeches, &#39;&#39;Screw the women!&#39;&#39;

And Bill Clinton&#39;s eyes light up and he says, &#39;&#39;Do we have time?&#39;&#39;</description>

              <p>Scientists have finally figured out what is wrong with men. The problem lies in the two halves of their brains - the left and the right.</p>
<p>The left half has nothing right in it, and the right half has nothing left in it!</p>

<p>Donald Rumsfeld is giving the President his daily briefing. He concludes by mentioning that yesterday, 3 Brazilian soldiers were killed.</p>
<p>– OH NO! the president exclaims. That’s terrible!</p>
<p>His staff sits stunned at this display of emotion, nervously watching as the President sits, head in hands.</p>
<p>Finally, the President looks up…</p>
<p>– Exactly how many is a brazillion?</p>
<hr>
<p>Three blondes were witnesses to a crime, so they went to the police station to identify the suspect.</p>
<p>The police chief said he would show them a mug shot of someone for thirty seconds, then ask each one for a description. After showing the photo to the first blonde, he covered it, then asked her how she would recognize the suspect.</p>
<p>– Easy, she replied. He only has one eye.</p>
<p>The chief was stunned.</p>
<p>– He only has one eye because it is a profile shot! Think about it!</p>
<p>He repeated the procedure for the second blonde and again asked how she would recognize him.</p>
<p>– He only has one ear, was her answer.</p>
<p>– What is the matter with you people?!? It is a profile shot! You are seeing him from the side!</p>
<p>He repeated the procedure for the third blonde.</p>
<p>– How would you recognize the suspect? Now think before you give me a stupid answer, he said</p>
<p>After viewing the photo, she thought for a minute before answering</p>
<p>– He’s wearing contact lenses.</p>
<p>This took the chief by surprise. He looked real hard at the picture and couldn’t tell if the suspect had contacts or not, so he went into the database and looked at the report. Sure enough, when the mug shot was taken, he was wearing contact lenses! He went back to her.</p>
<p>– How could you tell he was wearing contact lenses? Nobody else here in this precinct saw that!</p>
<p>– Well, she said, he can’t wear regular glasses with only one eye and one ear, now, can he?</p>

<p>If you think something will get you warned (eg, a stupid post), then it’s best not to go through with carrying out that ‘something’.[/center]</p>
