    <title>Some IRC Protocol stuff</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-irc-protocol-stuff/286220</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;m kinda making an IRC client right now for the experience, and there&#39;s some things I don&#39;t know.

The big one that&#39;s pissing me off is the server messages that get sent to you when you connect. I don&#39;t know how it works and it&#39;s hard to display the proper stuff.

For example, &quot;*server&quot; *something&quot; :&quot; and sometimes it doesn&#39;t even have the colon. I&#39;ve tried programming it to split some stuff, but since it&#39;s all different, I don&#39;t know how. I&#39;ve even found cases where a certain line has a small part of the string before the colon that has the message.

The other thing I don&#39;t know how to get is the people in a channel. As far as I know, it doesn&#39;t send any data for it when you join it.

I&#39;ve tried Googling this stuff, but I haven&#39;t found anything on how these specifically work.

Thanks,

<p>Ah, the idiosyncrasies of different IRC daemons. This is basically something you have to put up with. It will make your buffer parsing code very messy, but tough shit, basically. There are other things like this, for example servers are SUPPOSED to terminate messages with CRLF, some just use LF. Just have to work around it basically.</p>

<p>NAMES message. You’ll want to make sure you’ve joined first, if you NAMES before you join you’ll not get people who are set +i.<br>
Remember to keep your local copy up to date with joins parts and quits.</p>
