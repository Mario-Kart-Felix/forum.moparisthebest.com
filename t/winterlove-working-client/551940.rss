    <title>WinterLove &quot;Working&quot; Client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/winterlove-working-client/551940</link>
    <description>Hi, I have a starter WinterLove server but the client I downloaded does not match very well with my server. I&#39;ve had WinterLove clients before but they all seem to have dissapperared or are unworking links. If anyone has a link to a WinterLove working client they can link me that would be great, the client I downloaded is basically a combo of a server and a client it&#39;s kind of strange and that&#39;s probably what&#39;s making it so weird. It&#39;s a MoparScape client and it&#39;s bit far of a reach for me being new to private server based relations that I&#39;m used to. Just to be clear, I&#39;m not bashing the MoparScape client, it&#39;s just that most of the clients I use or are familiar with are separate and divided into two sections and not merged together as one.</description>

              <p>Is your client connecting to your server IP and port? it is also possible that the client has some sort of UID implementation. However, I’d check to first see if the IP and port are correct.</p>
