    <title>Linux Mint</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/linux-mint/433311</link>
    <description>Well, yesterday I was trying to connect my Uncle&#39;s PS3 controller to my PC. I used a program (which several youtubers recommended) and it overwrote every driver I had installed. I tried using the Asus recovery partition, but after clearing the OS partition of all its contents it threw an Error. Now that partition wont fully boot up either.

tl;dr - I have to install Linux Mint9 since it was the only working CD of linux that I currently have. Does anybody have any experience with Minecraft under this? I arleady know Skyrim and such are lost for me :&#39;(

EDIT: I will be downloading Ubuntu asap now that my computer is operable. Mint9 has no drivers for my computer so Minecraft ran at about 2-3FPS max lol.</description>
