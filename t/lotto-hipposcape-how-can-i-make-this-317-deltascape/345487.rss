    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lotto-hipposcape-how-can-i-make-this-317-deltascape/345487</link>
    <description>ok i have a couple questions here...

i have never worked with text or NPC names etc etc...

i want to create an item and modify an npc

For the npc i basicaly just want to change his name, i also want to add that when you talk to him he says wanna bu a lotto ticket 10k? and you can either answer Yes heres 10k and he gives you a lotto ticket and takes 10k or no thanks and it closes the interfance how can i do this?

for the item.. i want to create one using the base of a scroll.. so it will look like a scroll but be called Lotto ticket but has an option &quot;Scratch&quot; that has diferent chances of giving diferent amounts of money.

how could i dot anything of those?</description>
