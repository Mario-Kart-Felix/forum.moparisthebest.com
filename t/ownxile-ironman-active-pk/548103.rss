          <blockquote>
              <p>I decided today to unveil my vision for a better game, a vision that involves us all. I’ve thought for a long time about the way in which RSPS are created, managed and provided to players. This is an industry I’ve worked in for over 6 years and one that has become very familiar to me. I often wonder about how the way things are done and how they could be improved.</p>
<p>RSPS’s offer an alternative to RS, an opportunity for people to try something different. I find it strange that despite this opportunity, all RSPS owners choose to follow the same way of creating a game that RS does. I’ve always wondered to myself, is this the best way? RS and RSPS are all created by small groups of developers, who make decisions on what is best on behalf of their players. They may offer the opportunity for the community provide feedback, suggestions and vote in but they do not offer any kind of involvement beyond this. I think everyone would agree that the more players can become involved in the creation of the game, the more the game will suit those players.</p>
<p>So how do we go about building a bigger and better game together? Of course, we aren’t all programmers after all and not everybody wants to be part of the creative process. So the focus needs to be making game content creation as simple as possible as well as allowing for global involvement throughout the community. This is where the key to all of this comes in, the answer. A simplistic, easy to understand, scripting platform where game content can be created by anybody, without any requirement of programming knowledge just a desire to learn and create; I call it OwnScript!</p>
<p>The idea is focused on empowering all players of the game to create the game in a democratic manner. I want to make clear that this idea requires no drastic overhaul of the game at the moment; it proposes a new way in which we improve the game. Who could match the content of a game that is created by hundreds of content developers? Not even RS.  Without delving too much into the details, I’ll explain what will be possible. Have you ever wanted to design your own quest? Create your own shop? Design your own city? Improve the existing functionality of skills, npcs and items? Anybody with 5 minutes on their hands and a creative spark in their brain will be able to contribute these.</p>
<p>So please, take a second to imagine the potential of what we could all create together. Imagine that if we are all empowered to create how many cities, towns and dungeons could be created. It will even be possible to beat RS to 200 quests. To those who are skeptical, I say this. This is something that has never been attempted before; it ignores the existing paradigm of game production and explores a new way of working. I encourage people to imagine the possibilities but at the same time these possibilities are endless because we are in uncharted territory, there is no evidenced limit upon what we can achieve.</p>
<p>Get involved and let’s work together to create a genuinely revolutionary RSPS! Play now at <a href="http://www.OwnXile.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.OwnXile.com</a>!</p>

              <p>I hate browsing this site and seeing private servers going on there and having awful luck finding a good server. I see these ads promising great community nice staff blah blah never true. And always the sites for these servers are so confusing it’s ridiculous go register wait 10 days and then we will let you on. Then i came across ownxile. Thought to myself hmm, looks promising. I go the site. IT’s actually easy to sign up and instantly start playing. Well this is too good to be true the staff must be assholes or something wrong. I get on the game start training and started needing help finding some monsters to kill. Not only did the staff help me but along with 15+ players joining helping me out. just started today and no one knew me but had that type of community and helped me.</p>
