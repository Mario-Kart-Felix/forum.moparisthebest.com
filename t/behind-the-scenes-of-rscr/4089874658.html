<p>Not really, sheds more light on what happens when administrators like yourself have malicious/misleading purposes. From what most have already gathered, you had been accused of “hitting people offline” (with pictures/links as proof), stealing passwords (code taken from your source), and having intent to distribute malicious code inside player’s clients. Not only to mention that you had worked with t.X (another known malicious user who’s known for spreading malicious code), under a false name (Marko).</p>
<p>You’ve already had been banned from advertising your server, so I think it’s fair to say that this “stupid topic” has validity in what’s happening. If we’re to look at the rules, this should of been a permanent ban to follow the example of other previous members who had done the same.[/quote]</p>
<p>First: He was not hiding, nor was I from his name in game. It’s just a username, “Marko” take out the O what do you get? - “Mark” just because he was on my server does not mean he has to go by “T.X”, secondly he was only on for a short time since I paid him to fix a few bugs. If you’re really going to go on about that saying my server is Malicious because I paid T.X to fix a few bugs, you should say the same thing about RscEmulation since Luke did that as well, but may have not been bugs.</p>
<p>Also, I didn’t actually hit anyone offline. Like mubby said, he hacked a lot of accounts. Sure, I have his real IP address. Did I do anything? No. I just null routed him and banned his accounts. Also please tell me why I would steal passwords on my own server which has been up for a few months with development &amp; still continuing.</p>
<blockquote>and having intent to distribute malicious code inside player's clients</blockquote>
<p>Just because someone says this does not mean its true, implying you’re talking about ImTheNulls post, you are completely stupid. If you want to say there is malicious code in the client, please take the Rscangel client and tell me what you can find, or take my client, decompile it and check for yourself.</p>

<p>This topic is so stupid, if I wanted peoples passwords I would just take the password decryption out of the server instead of “Manually” using a command.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not really, sheds more light on what happens when administrators like yourself have malicious/misleading purposes. From what most have already gathered, you had been accused of “hitting people offline” (with pictures/links as proof), stealing passwords (code taken from your source), and having intent to distribute malicious code inside player’s clients. Not only to mention that you had worked with t.X (another known malicious user who’s known for spreading malicious code), under a false name (Marko).</p>
<p>You’ve already had been banned from advertising your server, so I think it’s fair to say that this “stupid topic” has validity in what’s happening. If we’re to look at the rules, this should of been a permanent ban to follow the example of other previous members who had done the same.<br>

<p>First: He was not hiding, nor was I from his name in game. It’s just a username, “Marko” take out the O what do you get? - “Mark” just because he was on my server does not mean he has to go by “T.X”, secondly he was only on for a short time since I paid him to fix a few bugs. If you’re really going to go on about that saying my server is Malicious because I paid T.X to fix a few bugs, you should say the same thing about RscEmulation since Luke did that as well, but may have not been bugs.</p>
<p>Also, I didn’t actually hit anyone offline. Like mubby said, he hacked a lot of accounts. Sure, I have his real IP address. Did I do anything? No. I just null routed him and banned his accounts. Also please tell me why I would steal passwords on my own server which has been up for a few months with development &amp; still continuing.</p>

<p>Just because someone says this does not mean its true, implying you’re talking about ImTheNulls post, you are completely stupid.

<p>Good job for trying to justify your actions, but there are some distinct differences to point out.</p>
<blockquote>First: He was not hiding, nor was I from his name in game.

<p>When he was in a position of accessing server/client-side code, it automatically became justifiable to say that he easily could of planted malicious code due to his history. The difference being, Luke (i’m not precisely sure how he operates dev), would not give over complete access or allow him to be in a position to plant malicious code without having looked at it/secured every end (most competent administrators understand security is <span class="hashtag">#1</span>).</p>
<blockquote>Also, I didn't actually hit anyone offline. Like mubby said, he hacked a lot of accounts. Sure, I have his real IP address. Did I do anything?

<p>It’s not about what you did, it’s pointing out the <span class="bbcode-b">intent</span> to actually carry out an attack. Nobody can say for sure if you did or not, but the proof stands about your initial <span class="bbcode-b">intent</span> to carry it out if the so called hacker did it again. In the real world, that’s a punishable offense regardless of the attacker’s intentions. As far as stealing passwords, I am purely speculating on the idea that there are multiple claims (on your forums) AND source code taken pointing to so called “hackings” after the hacker was seen to be “banned”.</p>

<p>Again, I don’t say things unless I have evidence/proof to back up my words. Need I point out the situation with you and mark? <span class="bbcode-i">He has a history, he had access, and possibly intent (this I cannot prove)</span>. There would be no point to evaluate your client at this time as you could of easily removed the code at any time prior to this conversation. The evidence alone speaks for itself…</p>

<p>I don’t give them direct access. I gave him Dropbox access which I can see what he does then the server was updated. Mark did not put any malicious code in the source at all, since I could see everything he did.</p>
<blockquote>It's not about what you did, it's pointing out the intent to actually carry out an attack.</blockquote>
It was a gesture to get them to stay off the server while I dealt with it. I wasn't going to actually hit them offline. 
For example:
<p>Hacker: Logs in the server using their real IP address hacking accounts<br>
Owner: Posts Announcement “Any hacker who has mass hacked accounts will be hit offline”<br>
Hacker: Oshit they have my real IP address, not logging in. (Proxy is pointless due to being stupid the first time).<br>
Owner: You lose.</p>
<p>Seeming as it worked, and most passwords are changed it seems fine to me.(Except maybe for people who played a long long time ago).</p>
<p>They didn’t retrieve the passwords through the source.</p>
