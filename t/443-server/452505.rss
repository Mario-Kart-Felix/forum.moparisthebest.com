    <title>443 Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/443-server/452505</link>
    <description>Recently I came across a 443 cache, so I decided to extract the client, deobfuscate and decompile it. It came out good, and I realized I wanted a server for it, so I dropped my 474 refactor project and started refactoring the 443. In order to make sure the client worked and I wasn&#39;t messing anything up, I wrote a quick server, which is what I&#39;m showing you here. Sinisoul is also refactoring his own version of the deob, and discovering stuff with me, so you&#39;ll probably see him posting here quite a bit.

Please note: This server was not written to be optimized, clean, pretty, powerful, or anything like that in any sort of way. It&#39;s strictly for discovering the 443 protocol (packets and such) and testing the client after I refactor something. That said, it&#39;s available on Google Code for you to use, along with my [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,555200.0.html]WIP refactored client[/url].

[b][url=https://code.google.com/p/443server/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk]Google Code Project Page[/url][/b]

Also note that the client uses dumped maps located in the maps folder in the cache folder. It is not my responsibility to provide you with them - add them yourself. Here&#39;s a screenshot just because.

Have fun :)
