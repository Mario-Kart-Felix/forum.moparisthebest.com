    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/resolved-denied-child-board-to-general-programming/445487</link>
    <description>Please add a child board to general programming titled &#39;Projects&#39;. I&#39;d love to have a place to post my non-rs2 related projects. This is also beneficial since teams can use the board for recruitment.</description>

              <p>We had a decision to make. Either we would continue to encourage general discussion and basically invite everyone who wanted to do RSPS development to go to a better community for it, or shift our focus back to the reason this community was created. I believe we should focus on RSPS development. General programming will continue to be used more and more in the future, once people are more familiar with the changed layout. The programming boards were on the bottom of <a href="http://Moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparisthebest.com</a>, too, so I see no reason why these can’t be equally successful. All it takes is time.</p>

<p>Nuh. The programming section back then was full of rsps bullshit in the wrong section. Hence the reason we separated the two. To be honest though, i give the MITB side another 6 months before they decide to remove it. Everyone has left. Every face is new.</p>

<p>according to what the mods have claimed in the  we say goodbye to the old bulbasaur topic they make out like mopar used to be revolved around rsps and now it’s revolved around several languages.</p>
<p>I disagree with that though, they are focusing on more rsps than several languages, so this doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p>If they were to move the general programming board at the top which branched to several languages I would agree with their statement.</p>

A lot of the boards on Moparisthebest could just be merged into a General Discussion board or made into child boards themselves (especially for GameDev, I don’t think you need all of those different boards when they could be cut down into ~5 or so child boards, with one big general one) to make the index smaller. Some of them are completely useless, anyway.</p>
<p>I just think we should be moved away from split websites to expand the community and overall discussion. Yes, people can already go over and get involved in those boards, but not many are willing to, or are even aware of them to do so.</p>

This. I’m in favor of merging everything to one site (including moparisthebest, which was touched on in another topic).

<p>Well said Rich. I would really like it if all the sites were into one, including moparcraft too. There would be much more activity in every board/section too. I never posted in the other topic originally because I figured people were just trolling and weren’t serious. However, it seems more people are actually supporting it and it appeals to me.</p>
<p>I doubt MITB will act on it though and if he did it would take several months for him to do it.</p>
