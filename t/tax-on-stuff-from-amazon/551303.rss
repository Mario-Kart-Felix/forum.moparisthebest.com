    <title>Tax on stuff from amazon</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tax-on-stuff-from-amazon/551303</link>
    <description>I am planning to buy a new graphics card for my PC from amazon that costs 340$ ( 500$ here , lol.. ) which is going to save me A LOT. The item does ship to my location from the US but amazon shows that i will have to pay 66$ as import fees or tax upon purchase for a total of 430$ ( still cheaper ) , So my question is .. Is it possible for me to get away from paying the tax amount? I usually tell sellers on my online purchases to declare on package low price to avoid tax , but here i&#39;m buying from MSI directly so i doubt that they would &quot;lie&quot; for me. And what&#39;s even worse if i had to pay tax for the taxed amount too when the card arrives to customs in here , fudging me over twice. But if i buy from other sellers will they be willing to help me or there is no escape?

Help appreciated if you have any experience with this stuff.

Thanks!</description>

              <p>Check up your country’s customs law yourself. There should be a way to avoid paying the tax for it twice. Import laws vary a lot from country to country and where you import it from.</p>

              <p>when shipping to outside countries that have customs checks and whatnot, users/companies have to pay the fee themselves. they’re not going to pay the fee and not charge you for it.</p>
<p>if they pay more than what Amazon charged you, you aren’t billed. if they pay less than what Amazon charged you, you’re refunded the difference.</p>
<p>however you cannot escape this as its customs. and international shipping</p>
