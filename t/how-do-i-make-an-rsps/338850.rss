    <description>[b][font=arial black][size=24pt]ok so im probably not going to get good responses since im a new member, but i would like to know if someone can help me with making and rsps. i have EVERYTHING i need to make an rsps but i just cant piece it together because i know almost nothing about java and computers but im trying to learn. i know its stupid for someone like me to want to make a rsps since i know nothing about computers, but im a fast learner and if someone would be willing to show me what to do i would be EXTREMELY grateful.[/size][/font][/b]</description>

              <p>Go to Barnes and Nobles.  Buy the book <span class="bbcode-u">“Java for Dummies”</span>, start at page one, and read to page 1000.  That will help a lot.  Open those files up, and play around with them.  Thats how I learned.  Trial and error.</p>

              <p>im pretty sure i do cause i remember downloading a java thing but it didnt seem like nothing happened. i have a client base and allthat i have all the tools like shopmaker’s, compilers, npc creators, item creators etc.but i just dont know what to do with all of it and i just dont know where to start. thats my main problem i just dont know where to start and how. if some on could make a vid (or a couple) or just tell me what to step by step that would be nice. im aware that its alot to ask of you guys to help me this much, because i know you all have better stuff to do, but if you could i would be so happy.</p>
