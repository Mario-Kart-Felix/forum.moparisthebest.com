    <description>to make you&#39;r signature have your server percentile do this


(code has spaces in them were it wouldn&#39;t turn the writing red intsead of showing you the code)


[c olor= limegreen][ | |[/co lor]

(now see how i only put that bit there cause thats the percentage done now heres the part we&#39;ll put in red that isn&#39;t done

[col or= red]| | | | | ][/co lor]


the last red part were i just finished off from the last will show what isn&#39;t completed now lets combine them together

[ | | || | | ]


here is the finished code with spaces 


[ | | || | | ]


if you wish to use this do not space nothing i spaced keep it all bunched together except the  [ | | | those need spaces to look right

this isn&#39;t a perfect tut and its not a really needed one just something for server development

between the color=limegreen and the [ | | | is the percentage

the [ | | | | | ] is the percentage[br][size=1]Posted at: August 03, 2006, 09:14:57 PM[/size][hr]and also you may want to use the bold tags stick all the text in between the bold tags only the part you want bold for example (with spaces) [b ] hello [/b ]

thereforth ending as

[b]hello[/b]

with the percentile in bold like this (with spaces)

[b ][co lor=limegreen][ | | |[/c olor][color= red]| | | ][/c olor][/b ]

there forth ending as (without spaces) [b][ | | || | | ][/b]

using bold markings at the top above teh smileys to the top left corner of the smileys and up a few things is a [b]b[/b] now to use the bold thing click that b and type in whatever you want to be bold between the [ b] and the [/b ][br][size=1]Posted at: August 03, 2006, 09:18:55 PM[/size][hr]not even one post.. tsk tsk tsk ashamed.. the least you could do is say nooby this is spam
