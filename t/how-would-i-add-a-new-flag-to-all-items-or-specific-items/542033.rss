    <title>How would I add a new flag to all items, or specific items?</title>

    <description>Hey guys would it be possible to add 2 new flags to the items in my server?

So I want to add a boolean to [u]all[/u] items in game. I don&#39;t want to say what it&#39;s for but it should be really obvious already.
The specifics of this flag:
Any item that has the flag true will be in a separate pile (each stackable item with this flag true).
That&#39;s really it. Lol.

The other flag would be an int. But, I only want it to show on specific items. I will work the stacking based off the above.</description>
