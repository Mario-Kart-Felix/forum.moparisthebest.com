    <title>Behind the Scenes May</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/behind-the-scenes-may/441117</link>
    <description>May promises a couple new updates that look actually pretty awesome, what&#39;s your thought? 
You can read all the updates [url=http://services.runescape.com/m=news/behind-the-scenes---may]here[/url]

One of the more major updates that caught my eye was one of the new bosses, [i]The Queen Black Dragon[/i] that&#39;s apparently 5 times bigger than the King Black Dragon and drops a Dragon Kiteshield.

<p>I honestly like the look of this, update wise. The advertising ploy is pretty obvious with ‘mad may’, but the actual updates seem pretty cool. To me it sounds like they are trying to fix the community, with clans and then this group rc training location and now these ‘bonfires’, and I really hope it works. The community is what made the game no longer fun if you ask me (example - house parties are virtually non-existent now <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> )</p>

<p>I’ve come to the conclusion they’ve given up on trying to bring back the old players so there now attempting to attract other mmo players.<br>
I wonder when they will convert to c++?</p>

</aside>
<p>Do you really think that redoing the whole thing in C++ is going to attract people? If anything, it would piss off the members who like the convenience of applets.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Obviously the majority of players wouldn’t even notice a difference because there 12.<br>
I’m insinuating that there going to have to change the language it’s programmed in to support the updates there implementing.<br>
[/quote]Except they don’t, you simply don’t have a clue what you are talking about.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>OH YEAH BECAUSE THE GAME IS REALLY HOLDING UP REAL WELL RIGHT NOW AMIRIGHT?<br>
In the future, not anytime soon however I suspect they’ll probably convert. Java wasn’t made to support what there trying to do anyways, and what do you mean “except they don’t”?</p>
<p>They don’t have to use C++ I’m just saying I don’t think it will be a java based game forever.<br>

<p>Lol @ thinking Java can’t handle it. If your computer is decent, RuneScape runs fine.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Educate yourself’s.<br>
It’s becoming increasingly obvious that there’s problems with lagg because of the language it’s written in, at the rate there developing and upgrading they’ll have to convert or the majority of players won’t even be able to play the game. [/quote]Lol, update today:</p>
<blockquote>Performance
<p>As many of you will be aware, some our previous anti-bot initiatives caused an adverse affect on the frame rate and performance of the game. The Game Engine Team has been working very hard on solutions to this and the update should bring significant increases in overall playability for the vast majority of those affected, noticeably more so on lower-spec computers.</p>

It’s becoming increasingly obvious that there’s problems with lagg because of the language it’s written in, at the rate there developing and upgrading they’ll have to convert or the majority of players won’t even be able to play the game. [/quote]And the lag issue has nothing to do with Java whatsoever. The are doing the only thing they can do to actively combat bots: Aggressive obfuscation. The exact same thing would happen to ANY other game regardless of the language it is written in. Jagex chose this trade-off, and i believe it was the right thing to do.</p>

<p>I honestly like the look of this, update wise. The advertising ploy is pretty obvious with ‘mad may’, but the actual updates seem pretty cool. To me it sounds like they are trying to fix the community, with clans and then this group rc training location and now these ‘bonfires’, and I really hope it works. The community is what made the game no longer fun if you ask me (example - house parties are virtually non-existent now <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> )</p>

OH YEAH BECAUSE THE GAME IS REALLY HOLDING UP REAL WELL RIGHT NOW AMIRIGHT?<br>
In the future, not anytime soon however I suspect they’ll probably convert. Java wasn’t made to support what there trying to do anyways, and what do you mean “except they don’t”?</p>
<p>They don’t have to use C++ I’m just saying I don’t think it will be a java based game forever.</p>
