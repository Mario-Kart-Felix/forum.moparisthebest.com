    <description>Ok, so i have the HellzTrojan (V2) source, and one of the shopkeepers (555) are saying &quot;The Owners Are Khasck And Kitty&quot;... so i go into NPCHAndler, and wen im there, I do Ctrl + f, and i search &quot;The Owners Are Khasck And Kitty&quot;, and when i search it, nothing comes up. Also, since the code for the shopkeepers are 555, i searched &quot;555&quot;, and i got a result of a shop keeper, and he is saying &quot;We do not sell mod/admin positions!&quot;, and he is not saying that, he is saying what was said above. Does anyone know what I&#39;m doing wrong?</description>
