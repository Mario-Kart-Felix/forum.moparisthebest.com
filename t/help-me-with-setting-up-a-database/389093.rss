    <title>Help me with setting up a database?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-me-with-setting-up-a-database/389093</link>
    <description>This is a learning process for me, so sorry for my illiteracy in this.
My friend wants me to make a website for him.
He wants it so people can register, and submit information to him such as credit cards because he wants to sell furniture he makes, like dressers or cabinets or tables etc...

I learned that you need a database to store the users, and that you can set one up with xampp.
But when I set everything up and finish this website, how would I transfer the database to him so I don&#39;t have to keep it running on my computer 24/7?
Is there a way to set up an online database so all he has to do is go to some website, enter the account information and then he has access to everything on the database? 
Or would I be able to make it so that when people submit the information to him, it just sends it to an email account or something?
Or, when he goes to get a hosting server, would the server work as a database and all the information would be stored there? 
Again, sorry for my lack of knowledge.</description>

              <p>SQL databases can be transfered with no problem, usually.  Only server specific information would have to be updated.</p>
<p>As for credit card information, you’ll probably want to use paypal or figure out that shit yourself.  Storing CC info in your own database will be the end of your company, given that you are a total novice.  Think about if that information gets out, it would be totally hazardous to your name.</p>
<p>I would totally utilize paypal or google’s payment shit.  You may have to spend a few cents/dollars per transaction, but it would be better for you in the long run.</p>

              <p>If your looking for a business site I would suggest looking for a website that already does this. Currently you have no knowledge of the current situation. So I am suggesting like a middleman website for example <a href="http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/</a><br>
( I wouldnt use it, just an example) and get your own url. <a href="http://gregsfurniture.com" rel="nofollow noopener">gregsfurniture.com</a> or whatever.</p>
