    <description>[size=18pt]Hey, ive posted a lot of topics on this section before and everyone seems to not reply for some reason, im not sure whether its them not knowing how to code 718&#39;s or just ]laziness. Im posting this to reach out to someone that does know how to edit these sources and is willing to help me with a few issues, some of them being changing the prices that shops buy items from you,, also some player commands. I also want to add website highscores and a ::vote command that works and points will be given. If you can help me you can PM me and we will talk from then on. You can also post down below of what you can help with. 
or just add me on skype : ildarkelly1
