    <description>[24/7]**RscStake**[24/7]

[b][u][i]I HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE DEDI TO GET SET UP IT IS CURRENTLY BEING SET UP AS WE SPEAK THE SOURCE AND FORUMS ARE READY TO GO.[/i][/u][/b]

**EDIT**
Dedi setup still working a little on the client forums are up now you can access the forums from http://rscstake.no-ip.org

For the RscStake Vets many of you probally already know who i am, but for those of you who dont then i would like to tell you a little bit of history about RscStake before you decide to join the server. The server was up last year around june, those who played last year and where mad that the server was shut down i am very sorry, as i ran into some legal issue&#39;s :S lol. Unlike the last RscStake, this is going to be 100% LEGIT. i myself am a original rsc player and i know how it is to work for something and show for what you have, unlike the rest of these servers where everything is pretty much spoon fed and givin away. Just think of playing RSCA again.

[i][b]UPDATES:[/b][/i]
[u]-Fixed[/u] the formulae.java because the mob fighting was messed up along with the pk/staking. Xp rates are set low to make the gameplay that much more enjoyable to play.
[u]-Working skills[/u] meaning every skill works. Skilling will be your main sorce of income.
[u]-King[/u] black dragons drop all dragon items and black demons drop longs and axes. Remember the drops are as close to the real thing as posible.
[u]-Added[/u] global chat for any player that wishes to talk amongst the rsc community.
-Shops are now all in 1 ( in general store and isnt packed screen at all ) very useful.
[u]-Friendly staff[/u], they are there when you need them and are very user friendly!
[u]-100% functional Godstaff/Godspells[/u] (charge is working now to)
[u]-Different landscape textures[/u]
[u]-Fixed drop rates[/u] on ALL monsters and they are about 99% accurate (never can be sure)
[u]-War events[/u], when these go on just pm mods/admins for summons. (mage arena)
[u]-Gambling[/u], those of you who love to gamble (besides staking) i am currently working on a lottery system. should be opperation within the week.
[u]-Quests[/u], should have ALL working F2P quests by the end of the week then hopefully start working on some P2P Quests.

<p>Not many members like Runescape Classic. Nevertheless, good luck with the server. The advertisement seems to be well nice.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-i">I HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE DEDI TO GET SET UP IT IS CURRENTLY BEING SET UP AS WE SPEAK THE SOURCE AND FORUMS ARE READY TO GO.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong><br>
Dedi setup still working a little on the client forums are up now you can access the forums from <a href="http://rscstake.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">http://rscstake.no-ip.org</a></p>
<p>For the RscStake Vets many of you probally already know who i am, but for those of you who dont then i would like to tell you a little bit of history about RscStake before you decide to join the server. The server was up last year around june, those who played last year and where mad that the server was shut down i am very sorry, as i ran into some legal issueâ€™s :S lol. Unlike the last RscStake, this is going to be 100% LEGIT. i myself am a original rsc player and i know how it is to work for something and show for what you have, unlike the rest of these servers where everything is pretty much spoon fed and givin away. Just think of playing RSCA again.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">UPDATES:</span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-u">-Fixed</span> the formulae.java because the mob fighting was messed up along with the pk/staking. Xp rates are set low to make the gameplay that much more enjoyable to play.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">-Working skills</span> meaning every skill works. Skilling will be your main sorce of income.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">-King</span> black dragons drop all dragon items and black demons drop longs and axes. Remember the drops are as close to the real thing as posible.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">-Added</span> global chat for any player that wishes to talk amongst the rsc community.<br>
-Shops are now all in 1 ( in general store and isnt packed screen at all ) very useful.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">-Friendly staff</span>, they are there when you need them and are very user friendly!<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">-100% functional Godstaff/Godspells</span> (charge is working now to)<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">-Different landscape textures</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-u">-Fixed drop rates</span> on ALL monsters and they are about 99% accurate (never can be sure)<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">-War events</span>, when these go on just pm mods/admins for summons. (mage arena)<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">-Gambling</span>, those of you who love to gamble (besides staking) i am currently working on a lottery system. should be opperation within the week.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">-Quests</span>, should have ALL working F2P quests by the end of the week then hopefully start working on some P2P Quests.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">COMMANDS:</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">::::::PLAYERS:::::::</span><br>
