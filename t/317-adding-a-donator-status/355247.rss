    <title>[317]- Adding a Donator Status</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-adding-a-donator-status/355247</link>
    <description>[b]Tutorial: How to Add Donator Status On your Server[/b]
[b]Toughness: 3/10; You will need to know how to do some basic editing[/b]
[b]Time needed to complete: 15-30 minutes (DEPENDING ON CODING EXPERIENCE) [/b]

To start off, you will need to go to your character file in the server files, and select the person you wish to create a donator. To do this, change their player rights to 10. This will make them hidden co-owner, but do not worry, not for long! Now save that, and go to the client.java section, and search for &quot;you are a hidden&quot;. Search this until you get to the page where it shows the login phrases. Such as for administrators it says- You are an administrator, respect your administrator status. Change this to the code below (REMEMBER THE TEXT IN BETWEEN THE {}, must be edited to your server information-

[code] }
        if (playerRights == 10) {
            sendMessage(&quot;Welcome to {your server name}&quot;);
            sendMessage(&quot;You&#39;re a donator of {YOUR SERVER} scape.&quot;);
            sendMessage(&quot;Thank you for contributing to our server&quot;);
            sendMessage(&quot;-Owner {OWNER USERNAME}.);
            newWelc();
        }[/code]

Now when the player with player rights of 10 logs in, it will say they are a donator. You CAN edit out some of that information such as your a donator of, and stuff like that to what you want  :D

[b]Part 2: Adding the rest (OPTIONAL)[/b]
This step is optional, but can be done. As of that time, there is no crown for the donator. So if you want other players to know that that person is a donator, you must give them moderator also. So they will have a gray crown, and moderator status. If you do not want them to have the full status of a moderator, such as not being able to ban users, you can change that by searching &quot;banuser&quot; in the client.java folder. So if you want them to have a gray crown, and moderator status, you would change their player rights to 1, and the code in client.java would be this-
[code] }
        if (playerRights == 1) {
            sendMessage(&quot;Welcome to {your server name}&quot;);
            sendMessage(&quot;You&#39;re a donator of {YOUR SERVER} scape.&quot;);
            sendMessage(&quot;Thank you for contributing to our server&quot;);
            sendMessage(&quot;-Owner {OWNER USERNAME}.);
            newWelc();
        }[/code]

Thanks and hope this helps, and remember no mean comments, I try to make this as easily done as possible, some people can do better, but this is an easy way to add a donator status!

Enjoy,

              <p>To go into more detail,</p>
<p>A. When a player logs in, their rights are sent to the client in raw byte form. These bytes are interpreted by the client, and everything that is handled client sided will give the person more rights. For example, and client sided commands, such as no-clip, could be performed by a donator.  Also, they would be given the admin crown. You <span class="bbcode-i">could</span> bypass this by editing the client, but that is more trouble that it’s worth. Try keeping the player rights the same, but creating a new variable to determine whether the user is a member or not.</p>
