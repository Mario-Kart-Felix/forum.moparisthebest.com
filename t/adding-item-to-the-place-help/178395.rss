Now, what that&#39;s saying is:
public static int capes[] = Obviously for capes  there isn&#39;t much to this, just adds whatever in the cape slot.
public static int boots[] = Obviously for boots, nothing else much to this either.
public static int gloves[] = This is a little tricky, I haven&#39;t been able to add bracelets just using gloves slot (more later)
public static int shields[] = Agian, very simple, nothing much to it either.
public static int hats[] = Now, this is more tricky, to fix the beard glitches and all that. You add anything that is worn in the head slot to this, but, to fix the glitches, read on.
public static int amulets[] = Nothing hard about this either.
public static int arrows[] = Pretty much never used, but hey lol, simple.
public static int rings[] = Mostly just used for perfect rings and Freminnik rings.
public static int body[] = This is also a thing that is used to fix glitches. Anything that is a platebody cannot just be classified under &quot;public static int platebody[]&quot; they have to be put here to be worn in the body slot. Are you catching on to what I&#39;m saying here?
public static int legs[] = Simple, thank god there isn&#39;t any other type of legs 
public static int platebody[] = Now, first you add whatever you add here into the &quot;body&quot; section, and if it&#39;s an item such as Void Knight Top, it would be glitched just added to the body slot, so add it here also. So pretty much anything that has glitchy sleaves add it to this slot as well.
public static int Helm[] = Ok, when you&#39;ve added your helm/hat to the &quot;hat&quot; slot, if it&#39;s an item such as the 3rd Age Mage Hat the hair would show, and it&#39;s not supposed to. Also this is the slot for hoods because adding the items here, will still show there beard/chin. That&#39;s how that glitch is fixed.
public static int fullMask[] = THIS is to add items such as Full Helms. This says that you are wearing an item that will cover up your hair and your chin, so it takes off the chin when worn. Using an item such as a Hood here would take off the chin and it would then be glitched. So add Hoods or anything that supposed to show beards/chins to the &quot;Helm&quot; slot.

________________________________

I hope that explains it well enough. It&#39;s just something I ran across while adding in some newer items. It should help for those that want to add items without the sleave glitch, or the chin glitch.  
OR for easier looking at the tut, go here http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,236643.0.html
Okay, so what do i do.I have no idea what it is triyng to say
I did everythign he said and still doesnt work.Looking for help please.I really want these items in the right place. :)</description>

<p>Now, what that’s saying is:<br>
public static int capes[] = Obviously for capes  there isn’t much to this, just adds whatever in the cape slot.<br>
public static int boots[] = Obviously for boots, nothing else much to this either.<br>
public static int gloves[] = This is a little tricky, I haven’t been able to add bracelets just using gloves slot (more later)<br>
public static int shields[] = Agian, very simple, nothing much to it either.<br>
public static int hats[] = Now, this is more tricky, to fix the beard glitches and all that. You add anything that is worn in the head slot to this, but, to fix the glitches, read on.<br>
public static int amulets[] = Nothing hard about this either.<br>
public static int arrows[] = Pretty much never used, but hey lol, simple.<br>
public static int rings[] = Mostly just used for perfect rings and Freminnik rings.<br>
public static int body[] = This is also a thing that is used to fix glitches. Anything that is a platebody cannot just be classified under “public static int platebody[]” they have to be put here to be worn in the body slot. Are you catching on to what I’m saying here?<br>
public static int legs[] = Simple, thank god there isn’t any other type of legs<br>
public static int platebody[] = Now, first you add whatever you add here into the “body” section, and if it’s an item such as Void Knight Top, it would be glitched just added to the body slot, so add it here also. So pretty much anything that has glitchy sleaves add it to this slot as well.<br>
public static int Helm[] = Ok, when you’ve added your helm/hat to the “hat” slot, if it’s an item such as the 3rd Age Mage Hat the hair would show, and it’s not supposed to. Also this is the slot for hoods because adding the items here, will still show there beard/chin. That’s how that glitch is fixed.<br>
public static int fullMask[] = THIS is to add items such as Full Helms. This says that you are wearing an item that will cover up your hair and your chin, so it takes off the chin when worn. Using an item such as a Hood here would take off the chin and it would then be glitched. So add Hoods or anything that supposed to show beards/chins to the “Helm” slot.</p>
<hr>
<p>I hope that explains it well enough. It’s just something I ran across while adding in some newer items. It should help for those that want to add items without the sleave glitch, or the chin glitch.<br>
OR for easier looking at the tut, go here <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,236643.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,236643.0.html</a><br>
Okay, so what do i do.I have no idea what it is triyng to say<br>
I did everythign he said and still doesnt work.Looking for help please.I really want these items in the right place. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
