 About us
Hello and welcome, Damnation is a revamped and totally new version of our old 317 server from 2009 &quot;Damnationscape&quot;.  We are back this time with a whole new outlook, and completely different layout than what most are used to.  Damnation is a competitive server, meaning it has xp rates as low as 3x runescapes rates, and is laid out like pre-eoc rs. So every npc is where they should be, every skill is 100% accurate with the exception of dungeoneering and construction for the time being. We started this project for the people who miss the way runescape used to be, while our xp rates are a bit faster than runescapes, it will not be a walk in the park for a 99.  This server is for those of you who want a challenge again, and to be known for your real effort and skill.  We have a very nice community already, while it is a bit low in numbers, they are dedicated players, some of which came from our original server.  For anyone who says we are not origonal, I urge you to find another server like ours, done in as great of detail as Damnation.  You will not find a single npc on our server that doesn&#39;t have it&#39;s stats, gfx, or emotes.  We work hard every day to bring more and more content, with quests coming soon, it should be quite a fun ride.  So if you&#39;re looking for a fresh start on a challenging server, we hope to see you soon!

Features
 
Dedicated, Friendly, and Mature Staff
By this I mean we at Damnation don&#39;t claim to be a great staff, we show it.  Unlike many other server owners, we take the time to listen to your feedback, and wont insult or shun you for bringing a bug or suggestion to our attention.
 
Working Custom Grand Exchange
Our grand exchange was made for the soul reason of buying or selling items other players don&#39;t have/want, so you never have junk sitting in your bank.  It has been set up so that when you buy and Item from the grand exchange you will be paying a bit more than if you were to be buying it from a player, and when you sell you will get less than from a player.  It is set up this way to encourage trade among players, rather than just selling it to the grand exchange, but still allows those pesky items no one wants to give you some profit.
 
Great Economy
With prices set very carefully, monster drops set just right, and grand exchange there to pick up any slack, our economy is as stable as can be.
 
99.9% Uptime
A dedicated VPS host keeps us up at all times, the only downtime will come from updates.
 
Highscores
A fully working highscores page allows you to follow the work of yourself and others, and work to beat the competition!
 
100% Vote System
Vote for the server and receive rewards automatically from a simple command!
 
100% Working Dicing
Everyone loves to gamble, and you can have your fill of it on Damnation, just make sure you know when to quit!
 
100% Working Curses
Boss like a boss with the help of Turmoil and Soul Split.
 
Working Jewelry
Most jewelry effects are working, with more being fixed daily, just to name a few.. Ring of Duelling, Ring of Wealth, Glory, Games necklace, Ring of recoil, and more!
 
Bank Pins
Use bank pins to keep your items safe!
 
Many Bosses
We have a wide range of bosses including, KBD, QBD, Nex, Corp, all GWD bosses, and more!
 
Minigames
Our minigame line up includes, Castle wars, soul wars, pest control, barrows, fight caves (63 waves), fight kiln (37 waves), even fully working shooting stars!! and more!
 
Squeal of Fortune
SOF is here and filled with a large assortment of useful and cosmetic items!
 
Low Experience Rates
WARNING IF YOU DON&#39;T LIKE A CHALLENGE THIS MAY NOT BE THE SERVER FOR YOU!
Our experience rate is only about 3x rs experience rate.  This allows our players to feel a sense of accomplishment for all of their skills, items, money, and most importantly their place in the high scores! This is NOT a fast paced server, where
everything is handed to you from spawn, you will work for everything you have.
 
Open world
There is no &quot;Home&quot; on damnation, everything is where it should be, every dungeon is accessible, every agility shortcut usable with the level requirement.  Every town has it&#39;s correct NPCs, shops, ect.
 
100% skills
Every skill on damnation is 100% accurate, there are no half put together skills.  You can use every patch for farming, and watch your crop grow, use
every slayer master, and move up with your slayer level. Use every agility course including advanced courses, as well as every agility shortcut with the correct level requirements in place. The only skills not 100% complete at this time are construction, and dungeoneering, but we hope to have them completed very soon.

              <p>Hey everyone, I just tried this server and can’t help but making an account to help promote it by bumping his thread. The owner is online over 18 hours per day and instantly fixes bugs you find, updates prices in the ge if you find mistakes, even changes game dynamics and implements major updates based on suggestions. The second you log on if you have a reasonable suggestion other players online like, it has a great chance of getting added on the spot.</p>
<p>There are over ten updates per day, the experience rate is now 3x, 12x, and 15x with benefits of picking the lower ones. The ge is still improving but near perfect and always instant, voting rewards and donation rewards have increased. New bosses are in the works and it’s still as competitive as ever with 120 maximum stats.</p>
<p>You can click here and view the daily updates, he doesn’t tweet them all <a href="https://twitter.com/DamnationRev" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://twitter.com/DamnationRev</a></p>
<p>I’m tired of maxing one server in a few days to weeks and starting another one, we have an excellent community of good natured people and a competitive server that offers longevity with unique content.

</aside>
<p>Will give it a try, if i may believe you.<br>
Usually when i see ‘718’ i don’t even bother looking since they’re all the same like you said above. (99 in 5 mins,edgeville etc)</p>
<p>Will stop by and perhaps stick around. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Although i wish there would just be a link, no need to register for a client. I hate being forced to register.<br>
Might as well not even try this server anymore, just because of the forum force to play.</p>

<p>About us<br>
Hello and welcome, Damnation is a revamped and totally new version of our old 317 server from 2009 “Damnationscape”.  We are back this time with a whole new outlook, and completely different layout than what most are used to.  Damnation is a competitive server, meaning it has xp rates as low as 3x runescapes rates, and is laid out like pre-eoc rs. So every npc is where they should be, every skill is 100% accurate with the exception of dungeoneering and construction for the time being. We started this project for the people who miss the way runescape used to be, while our xp rates are a bit faster than runescapes, it will not be a walk in the park for a 99.  This server is for those of you who want a challenge again, and to be known for your real effort and skill.  We have a very nice community already, while it is a bit low in numbers, they are dedicated players, some of which came from our original server.  For anyone who says we are not origonal, I urge you to find another server like ours, done in as great of detail as Damnation.  You will not find a single npc on our server that doesn’t have it’s stats, gfx, or emotes.  We work hard every day to bring more and more content, with quests coming soon, it should be quite a fun ride.  So if you’re looking for a fresh start on a challenging server, we hope to see you soon!</p>

<p>Features</p>
<p>Dedicated, Friendly, and Mature Staff<br>
By this I mean we at Damnation don’t claim to be a great staff, we show it.  Unlike many other server owners, we take the time to listen to your feedback, and wont insult or shun you for bringing a bug or suggestion to our attention.</p>
<p>Working Custom Grand Exchange<br>
Our grand exchange was made for the soul reason of buying or selling items other players don’t have/want, so you never have junk sitting in your bank.  It has been set up so that when you buy and Item from the grand exchange you will be paying a bit more than if you were to be buying it from a player, and when you sell you will get less than from a player.  It is set up this way to encourage trade among players, rather than just selling it to the grand exchange, but still allows those pesky items no one wants to give you some profit.</p>
<p>Great Economy<br>
With prices set very carefully, monster drops set just right, and grand exchange there to pick up any slack, our economy is as stable as can be.</p>
<p>99.9% Uptime<br>
A dedicated VPS host keeps us up at all times, the only downtime will come from updates.</p>

A fully working highscores page allows you to follow the work of yourself and others, and work to beat the competition!</p>

<p>Low Experience Rates<br>
WARNING IF YOU DON’T LIKE A CHALLENGE THIS MAY NOT BE THE SERVER FOR YOU!<br>
Our experience rate is only about 3x rs experience rate.  This allows our players to feel a sense of accomplishment for all of their skills, items, money, and most importantly their place in the high scores! This is NOT a fast paced server, where<br>
everything is handed to you from spawn, you will work for everything you have.</p>
<p>Open world<br>
There is no “Home” on damnation, everything is where it should be, every dungeon is accessible, every agility shortcut usable with the level requirement.  Every town has it’s correct NPCs, shops, ect.</p>
<p>100% skills<br>
Every skill on damnation is 100% accurate, there are no half put together skills.  You can use every patch for farming, and watch your crop grow, use<br>
every slayer master, and move up with your slayer level. Use every agility course including advanced courses, as well as every agility shortcut with the correct level requirements in place. The only skills not 100% complete at this time are construction, and dungeoneering, but we hope to have them completed very soon.</p>
