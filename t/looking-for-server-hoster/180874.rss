    <title>Looking for server hoster</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-server-hoster/180874</link>
    <description>Hey, i have just somewhat completed editing my server and im looking for a hoster. They can have free admins. I preferably need someone who can leave the server on for a long time as i cannot as my pc is only 54mbps wireless adapter :s. As long as i get admin and you do not edit then its ok. Also dont claim it  your own as i worked hard.

24/7 would be GREAT but im not really bothered about dedicated cause you have to pay. this server is for fun but its not much good if noone is on it long enough


Anyone interested post here. You MUST not be an amateur i.e. someone who doesn&#39;t know how to pf....

Also tell me how long you can host per day and at what times.</description>
