    <title>How to make yourself admin on your server ~ By Teh one</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-yourself-admin-on-your-server-by-teh-one/324472</link>
    <description>Hello guys, well it&#39;s very simple how to make yourself owner, and its more or less the same on any type of base you have from 317-564&#39;s

Well I&#39;m using my 317 server to show you how to do it but i will also show a 508 as well. 

right, first open you source and look for a folder named &quot;Characters&quot; (Btw you need to have an account on that source!) And look for your username, If it&#39;s your first time loading this source and it has other usernames on it because the last owner was to lazy to delete, then highlight all those usernames and delete them.. Give you more room. Soon as you find your username, open it up! It will look like this:

[code][ACCOUNT]
character-username = (what ever it is)
character-password = (what ever your password is)

[CHARACTER]
character-height = 0
character-posx = 3434
character-posy = 3572
character-rights = 0
character-ismember = 0
character-messages = 0
character-lastconnection = localhost
character-lastlogin = 20100007
character-energy = 100
character-gametime = 0
character-gamecount = 26471[/code] 

Now the bit you need is the:

[code]character-rights = 0[/code]

Now see where the 0 is? You need to change that to 2 for admin!

1 = Moderator
2 = Administrator 
3 = Owner

So if you want owner rights put &quot;3&quot; but it can be more complicated than that, so i&#39;ll post another guide for making yourself owner.

After you finished, close the file and log on your account, Your admin!

(Tip: make sure you are logged off the server before attempting this, as it will not save! You will still be Rights=0!)

Thanks for reading this!

I hope i have helped you!
