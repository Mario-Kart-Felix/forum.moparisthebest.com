    <title>Can&#39;t Play Frisbee in School</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-play-frisbee-in-school/394027</link>
    <description>Today, while me and a few friends were playing Frisbee a teacher came out and took them our Frisbee away. They also said it was against the rules and it was in the head book &quot;a lie&quot;..... It gets even better, our school allows Hacky Sack and ninja both games are far worse then just tossing a Frisbee around.... One last thing, after the day was over I was able to get it back, then the principle who has gone by us god knows how many times while we were just playing Frisbee said nothing and just walk on, also he has even talked with us, not about the Frisbee but other stuff and said nothing about it still, and when I come to pick it up he is like &quot;Frisbees aren&#39;t allowed on school property....&quot; and then he said it is in the hand book...


What do you think, also does your school ban things that actually give you exercise?</description>
