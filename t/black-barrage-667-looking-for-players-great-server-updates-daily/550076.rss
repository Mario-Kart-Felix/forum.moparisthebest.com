              <p>Probably wouldnt recomend this server. Played it for about an hour, then some new person comes on asking for a drop party, so I dropped my IRON hatchet as a joke, I even said i was dropping it. Nek minute the guy said im duping and without even questioning him I got jailed and ip banned.</p>
<p>Was actually a dafuq moment.</p>
<p>The owner:<br>
A) didnt even question him.<br>
B) didnt even ask me about it.<br>
C) believed someone who was playing for 2 minutes<br>
D) Straight up IPbanned. No warning or anything.</p>
<p>And i know they werent friends, since the guy even came online and the first thing he said was “I am going to test glitches”. So i dont see why he Ipbanned me.</p>
<p>But yolo <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> shit happens.</p>
