    <title>How do I add sprites to my sprites folder?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-add-sprites-to-my-sprites-folder/373814</link>
    <description>I have a sprite folder already, but only one sprite in it, my background sprite, it works, but it came with my client, so i want to add more sprites to it, I have tom&#39;s cache editor, but I&#39;d rather use a sprites folder, may anyone tell me how to add more sprites to it?

This is what I think, dump the sprites out of my cache, and add to folder, is that correct, more to it, or wrong?</description>
