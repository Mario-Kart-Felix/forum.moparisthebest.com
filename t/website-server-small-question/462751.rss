    <description>Why would a website cause a communication link error between the mysql connector and the web server?

I have read tons of documentations about the error that the server is spitting out, but nothing it points at is giving me any hints to the server being incorrect.

I thought it might have been because I didn&#39;t add my ip to the remote sql list, but that didnt solve anything either. 

I think it may be the web server, but I don&#39;t know what would cause it. Any ideas?</description>

</aside>
<p>Thats what I was asking.</p>
<p>I’m using CPanel and have already put my ip into the remote sql. Im running the server (eventually) from this pc.<br>
Like I mentioned; I am pretty confident that I have the sql driver configured properly and I have read a bunch of documentations about this error but none of it explains if/why my web server may be denying the connection.</p>
