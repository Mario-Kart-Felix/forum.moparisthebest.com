    <description>Yesterday, my server was working all right when today, when I try to type a command, nothing happens. It is recorded in the server console that a command was typed but nothing happens. I&#39;ve tried this with moparscape and silab client, but it dosen&#39;t work. I&#39;ve tried restarting the server and my computer, but its the same. PLS HELP!!</description>
