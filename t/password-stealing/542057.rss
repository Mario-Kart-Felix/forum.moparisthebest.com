    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/password-stealing/542057</link>
    <description>Hi guys, i played a server a while-back and a bunch of hackers managed to find the password list to the server, they said the passwords weren&#39;t hex&#39;d or whatever, but what confuses me is how they were able to maintain the password list? anyone got an idea how?</description>

              <p>Most likely they somehow hacked the owner (or the owner sold or the hacker was the owner itself) and got the server character files, and they weren’t encrypted/hashed. However, this topic sounds a lot like you just want to know how to modify the client to steal passwords and we don’t condone that here.</p>
