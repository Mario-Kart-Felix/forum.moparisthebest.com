    <title>PJA question (maybe this is pretty hard..)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pja-question-maybe-this-is-pretty-hard/336497</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using Project Annihilation as my base... What I got added is some commands and FULL construction and a big part of agility.. The problem is, I can&#39;t get the animations work correctly! I mean, I get the animation to play I wanted but that the player stops there and cannot move as the animation is an infinite loop (or w/e) is not that wanted, ehh...?

So to the question; how do i make that the player moves while doing the animation and does the animation I want it to do??? Thanks for answers!</description>
