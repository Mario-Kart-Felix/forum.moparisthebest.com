    <title>Random Song Lyrics</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/random-song-lyrics/438297</link>
    <description>Post the lyrics from a random song thread!
Example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As soon as you&#39;re born they make you feel small
By giving you no time instead of it all
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
A working class hero is something to be

They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
They hate you if you&#39;re clever and they despise a fool
Till you&#39;re so ****ing crazy you can&#39;t follow their rules
A working class hero is something to be

When they&#39;ve tortured and scared you for twenty-odd years
Then they expect you to pick a career
When you can&#39;t really function you&#39;re so full of fear
A working class hero is something to be

Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV
And you think you&#39;re so clever and classless and free
But you&#39;re still ****ing peasants as far as I can see
A working class hero is something to be

There&#39;s room at the top they&#39;re telling you still
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
If you want to be like the folks on the hill

A working class hero is something to be
If you want to be a hero well just follow me&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>Misread it. Jeez <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Here is a good punk ‘love song’</p>
<p>I Fell In Love With A Ninja Master By: The Wonder Years</p>
<blockquote>With a smoke bomb you're gone and I'm alone. 
I'm waiting for you to get home, tired of sitting here with the swords you own. 
I'm starting to worry about you. 
Your skin is always black and blue.
You can't defend this city all alone, its true.
<p>But I’m forced away (It’s nunchucks to the face).<br>
And I’m missing your warm but deadly embrace.<br>
And I can’t make out the shape of your face.<br>
You’ve masked it with all your honor and grace.</p>
<p>Let’s not say you broke my heart.<br>
You pierced it with a throwing star.<br>
It was an accident. I know your aim is off.<br>
Jump kicks are getting hard to miss.<br>
All I wanted was a kiss.<br>
It’s getting really hard to live like this.</p>
<p>You’ve been throwing stars at my heart and now we’ve come this far.<br>
I should have seen it from the start.<br>
I see that it’s finally time to part.<br>
You fucked me up with your poison dart.<br>
I shoulda seen it from the fucking start!  From the fucking start!</p>

<p>My legs are dangling off the edge,<br>
The bottom of a bottle is my only friend,<br>
I think I’ll slit my wrists again and I’m gone, gone, gone,<br>
My legs are dangling off the edge,<br>
A stomach full of pills didn’t work again,<br>
I’ll put a bullet in my head and I’m gone, gone, gone, gone.</p>
<p>Gone too far and yeah I’m gone again,<br>
It’s gone on too long, tell you how it ends,<br>
I’m sitting on the edge with my two best friends,<br>
Ones a bottle of pills, ones a bottle of gin,<br>
I’m 20 stories up, yeah I’m up at the top,<br>
I’ll polish off this bottle, now it’s pushing me off,<br>
Asphalt to me has never looked so soft,<br>
I bet my momma found my letter, now shes calling the cops,<br>
I gotta take this opportunity before I miss it,<br>
'Cause now I hear the sirens and they’re off in the distance,<br>
Believe me when I tell you that I’ve been persistent,<br>
'Cause I’m more scarred, more scarred than my wrist is,<br>
I’ve been trying too long, with too dull of a knife,<br>
But tonight I made sure that I sharpened it twice,<br>
I never bought a suit before in my life,<br>
But when you go to meet god, you know you wanna look nice.</p>
<p>So if I survive, then I’ll see you tomorrow,<br>
Yeah I’ll see you tomorrow.</p>

A stomach full of pills didn’t work again,<br>
I’ll put a bullet in my head and I’m gone, gone, gone, gone.</p>
<p>We hit the sky, there goes the light,<br>
No more sun, why’s it always night<br>
When you can’t sleep, well, you can’t dream,<br>
When you can’t dream, well, what’s life mean?<br>
We feel a little pity, but don’t empathize<br>
The old are getting older, watch a young man die,<br>
A mother and a son and someone you know,<br>
Smile at each other and realize you don’t,<br>
You don’t know what happened to that kid you raised,<br>
What happened to the father, who swore he’d stay?<br>
I didn’t know 'cause you didn’t say,<br>
Now momma feels guilt, now momma feels pain,<br>
When you were young, you never thought you’d die,<br>
Found that you could but too scared to try,<br>
You looked in the mirror and you said goodbye,<br>
Climb to the roof to see if you could fly.</p>
<p>So if I survive, then I’ll see you tomorrow,<br>
Yeah I’ll see you tomorrow.</p>
<p>My legs are dangling off the edge,<br>
The bottom of a bottle is my only friend,<br>

A stomach full of pills didn’t work again,<br>
I’ll put a bullet in my head and I’m gone, gone, gone, gone.</p>
<p>I wish that I could fly, way up in the sky,<br>
Like a bird so high,<br>
Oh I might just try,<br>
I wish that I could fly, way up in the sky,<br>
Like a bird so high,<br>
Oh I might just try,<br>

Example:</p>
<blockquote>As soon as you're born they make you feel small
By giving you no time instead of it all
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
A working class hero is something to be
<p>They hurt you at home and they hit you at school<br>
They hate you if you’re clever and they despise a fool<br>
Till you’re so ****ing crazy you can’t follow their rules<br>
A working class hero is something to be</p>
<p>When they’ve tortured and scared you for twenty-odd years<br>
Then they expect you to pick a career<br>
When you can’t really function you’re so full of fear<br>
A working class hero is something to be</p>
<p>Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV<br>
And you think you’re so clever and classless and free<br>
But you’re still ****ing peasants as far as I can see<br>
A working class hero is something to be</p>
<p>There’s room at the top they’re telling you still<br>
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill<br>
If you want to be like the folks on the hill</p>
<p>A working class hero is something to be<br>
If you want to be a hero well just follow me</p>
