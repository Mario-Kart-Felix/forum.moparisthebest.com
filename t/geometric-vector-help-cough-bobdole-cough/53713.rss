    <description>Hey.
Well, I just started back at school, and I seem to have forgotten some stuff over the holidays. The first maths lesson was revision of geometric vectors, and I pretty much understand everything, but I&#39;m having trouble solving one question. The question is as follows:

A pilot wishes to fly 250km on a bearing of 300[sup]o[/sup] in a light plane, capable of 90 knots. There is a westerly wind blowing at 20 knots. What heading should the piolet set, and how long will the flight take?

So I launched into it, and got the two polar vectors:
v1 = (90, 150[sup]o[/sup]) -&gt; Heading to destination + speed
v2 = (20, 180[sup]o[/sup]) -&gt; Wind speed + direction

I know I have to convert these to cartesian vectors and do something, but I am not sure what. (Im also not sure if v1 is correct).

Anywayz, help would be appreciated.</description>

<p>Well, my first issue with this problem is the 300[sup]o[/sup] - if his heading is 300[sup]o[/sup] (-60[sup]o[/sup]), then shouldn’t the polar coordinate be (90, 300[sup]o[/sup])?  We’ll see how that goes though.</p>
<p>Anyway, you don’t absolutely need to convert to cartesian coordinates…what you really need to do is add the plane’s vector with the wind vector to get a resultant, from which you can get the time reqruired to travel.  So I’ll work out the x and y components for both, and you can take your pick.</p>
<p>(If you don’t remember, x component is rcos(theta) and y component is rsin(theta))</p>
<p>v[sub]150x[/sub] = -77.9 m/s<br>
v[sub]150y[/sub] = 75 m/s</p>
<p>v[sub]300x[/sub] = 75 m/s<br>
v[sub]300y[/sub] = -77.9 m/s</p>
<p>v[sub]windx[/sub] = -20 m/s<br>
v[sub]windy[/sub] = 0 m/s</p>
<p>So</p>
<p>v[sub]150[/sub] = 123 m/s at about 142[sup]o[/sup]<br>
v[sub]300[/sub] = 95 m/s at about 305[sup]o[/sup]</p>
<p>Hope those are right…and so, you have the resultant velocity vectors for both angles in question…and you can easily work out the time it takes to travel 250 km from those ;)[/quote]</p>

<p>This question is difficult because the anle he sets out from is in a different quarter to the original 300 degree angle which reverses which is o h and a.</p>
<p>i will ahve another think in an hour or so, it will come to me. i just need to draw a diagram.</p>
<p>Fuck that makes no sense, it cant change quarter. AAAARRRRGGHHH. i will beat this.</p>
