~RuneJizz~

Some of you may have heard of RuneJizz before. We&#39;ll i hosted it before and my computer pretty much died so the server went down for a while. I lost my whole development team! But i&#39;m back now and i&#39;m looking for a new one!

________________________________________________________

Spots:

Coder:None

Fourm creator:None

Co Owner:Taken - Mod Pilgrim

Head Admin:None

Admin:None

Mod:None

________________________________________________________________________

Coder info: Interested in Coder spot? Great we&#39;re gonna need you. But we need a coder who can code 317-508(required)(525+ would be helpful). I can code some but it&#39;s been a while therefore you need to beable to start the server. put the ip in the client etc. I have been having trouble getting the source to be online. So that would be helpful if you could do this(We need coder ASAP)

 

Fourm creator info: Good at creating forums? Put it to the test. RuneJizz has a forum right now, but its old from before runejizz was shut down the first time. We need you to beable to make a new one(: There isn&#39;t too much info for this but it would be nice if you weren&#39;t a beginner forum maker. (This is my nice way of saying don&#39;t apply if you&#39;re somewhat new to it)

 

Staff spots info: This section is for every staff spot. Head Admin-Mods. Unfourtunatly we won&#39;t be needing any staff until runejizz is up and running. You may however go ahead and apply under this section and you will be the first picked if i think you deserve the spot. (Use a NEAT format. If it&#39;s not neat i will not read and i will skip-sorry) If you&#39;re too lazy to be neat with you&#39;re application and make it look nice it&#39;s showing me that you are going to be a lazy and not worth staff member. So please try your best
