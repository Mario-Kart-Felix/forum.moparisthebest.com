    <description>I&#39;ve looked for hours trying to find how to a &quot;Dice&quot; like thing; such as ::roll makes a random number message to all, for everyone it&#39;s the same number, and it goes from 1-100, so if someone were to go ::roll it would send to all &quot;playernamehere has just rolled a numberhere on the dice! Gambler won!&quot; or &quot;Gambler lost!&quot; if it&#39;s under like 55 (making 55X2 dicing) my source is Allstar, if anyone can help I would greatly appreciate it.</description>
