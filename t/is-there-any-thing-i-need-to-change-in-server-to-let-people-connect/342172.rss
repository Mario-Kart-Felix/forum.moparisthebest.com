    <title>Is there any thing I need to change in server to let people connect?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-there-any-thing-i-need-to-change-in-server-to-let-people-connect/342172</link>
    <description>Is there any thing I need to change in server to let people connect? I am pretty sure everything is client sided. When I try to register a server it says it is offline, when I have it running. I am port fowarded and have a no-ip.duc going. I really don&#39;t know what is wrong.

EDIT: Nvm I&#39;m and idiot typed ip wrong :p. Any one know how long it takes to get verrified?</description>
