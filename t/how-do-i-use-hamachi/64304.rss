    <title>How do I use hamachi?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-use-hamachi/64304</link>
    <description>hello, I have downloaded hamachi and i have it joined to a server, I have a list of the people in the server at the moment and it says it is online. When I write the IP it tells you to put in, it does not work. 

I click the join existing network button,and i put in the name and pass and from there i do not understand why cannot get on (i have never used hamachi before)
 
what am i doing wrong??
