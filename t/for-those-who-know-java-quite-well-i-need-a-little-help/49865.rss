    <description>Hi.
My server has nulls.
They&#39;re quite bad.
Source: HIGHLY modified Cheezscape78 (PvpScape)
Heres the deal, I start the server, and if someone is attempting a connection, I get this null: [code]Starting Enkrona on 0.0.0.0:43594
Exception in thread &quot;Thread-0&quot; java.lang.NullPointerException
        at server.run(Unknown Source)
        at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)
[/code]
Now, when I don&#39;t get that, my server will not allow two people to connect simultaneously.  I get [code]ClientHandler: Accepted from (ip)[/code]
Then they do not log in, and they spam this, thus creating nulls, thus crashing my server.  If everyone can get on my server fine, they will play for around 20 minutes, the I get another null that crashes the server.
Can this be fixed? Or is my server doomed?

Modified reply:
Please help? No? :&#39;(

Aww.. :(

              <p>Since it says “Unknown source” instead of the line number the problem originated on, then you can’t fix it. So until you get it to give a proper error, your screwed.</p>
