    <description>THIS IS ALL CLIENT SIDED

Honestly I didn&#39;t see a good place for this to go, seeing as RS2 Client Hackings description didn&#39;t really seem to fit this, plus this is a mere snippet and I didn&#39;t wanna post 2 bits of code in that section. Anyways for this snippet you will need to have done this:

http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/google/tutorials/493470-pi-simple-music-sound-system.html

Now this is the easiest thing in the world to add, but I just figured someone who wanted to have a basic music system would want this. What&#39;s this going to add? Basically this is going to add that classic client loadup jingle, and then stops it upon login. I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s what happened on runescape anyways...

So if you don&#39;t already have this jingle1.mid then you can download it here: [url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/29233368/jingle1.rar]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/29233368/jingle1.rar[/url]

Just make a folder in you&#39;re cache called Music and throw it in there. Not sure if you already have this jingle or not? Go to your main cache directory and look for &#39;jingle1&#39;. If you have it, good, just slap it in that Music folder. Now in your main startup method in client.java add this bit of code (which would be: [code]public static void main(String args[]) {[/code]

[code]
Music.Music(&quot;jingle1.mid&quot;);
[/code]

Just add it directly under [code]try {[/code]

Now in the same class find your login method [code]private void login[/code] and somewhere under there look for [code]loggedIn = true;[/code]

Directly under that add this:

[code]
Music.stop();
[/code]

What does this do? This basically says &quot;if players login status == true then execute the stop method from Music.java&quot; which obviously stops all currently playing tracks. Also, if a mod feels that this fits in the Client section then feel free to move it, as afore mentioned I just wasn&#39;t sure.</description>
