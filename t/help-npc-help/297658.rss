    <description>I dont think my server has npc combat, and i dont really want to add it people can train on players though.
is it possible to make like a spammer that will only spam every 10 secs
and will just walk to the pvp area saying &quot;Train On ME!&quot;?
is this possible?
if so how would i do it?</description>
