    <title>SMF packages problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/smf-packages-problem/327138</link>
    <description>Honestly, I have no idea if some of you will be able to assist me or not, but it is worth a try posting since the SMF support hasn&#39;t replied to my thread again, and I personally don&#39;t know what is wrong.

The problem is that ever since I upgraded a forum from SMF 1.1.11 to SMF 2.0 RC2, the packages have not seemed to be working at all. At first the CHMOD function wasn&#39;t working on the package directory and a few files in it, if you find it relevant. But I had contacted my host support and they quickly fixed it, however it did not fix my Package problem. No matter what theme I use, none of my packages show up on either the forum or the Admin CP, nor do any part of what should be appearing from it.

Note that these packages also installed perfectly fine.

Any ideas?</description>

              <p>mm I will try and figure this out anyway, I had a discussion with their support staff and it may be a fault of my hosting account, so we’ll have to see.</p>
<p>Anyway, thank you all for the help, it was well appreciated, and I’ll update this thread if the current plan doesn’t succeed. ;\</p>

<p>Ah that was a problem related with him upgrading to SMF, I have upgraded successfully although I did have previous problems when I had tried upgrading. This is a problem with my packages, they do not appear whatsoever even when they are installed. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>Honestly, I have no idea if some of you will be able to assist me or not, but it is worth a try posting since the SMF support hasn’t replied to my thread again, and I personally don’t know what is wrong.</p>
<p>The problem is that ever since I upgraded a forum from SMF 1.1.11 to SMF 2.0 RC2, the packages have not seemed to be working at all. At first the CHMOD function wasn’t working on the package directory and a few files in it, if you find it relevant. But I had contacted my host support and they quickly fixed it, however it did not fix my Package problem. No matter what theme I use, none of my packages show up on either the forum or the Admin CP, nor do any part of what should be appearing from it.</p>
<p>Note that these packages also installed perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
