    <description>if easyrsc is based off rscd then why do some of the items like the different color masks, or the legendary axe can be spawned? as soon as i spawn them the client crashes. I&#39;m kind of new to this coding thing, is it because the client isn&#39;t updated all the way? idk. Don&#39;t flame me im just asking a simple question.</description>

Also, what does this have to do with development? You should of asked in the help section.</p>
