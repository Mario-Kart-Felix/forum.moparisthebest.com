    <title>Computer Science Students of Mopar: What Are Your Plans?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/computer-science-students-of-mopar-what-are-your-plans/540572</link>
    <description>We seem to have a lot of computer science students here or at least people who are learning to program. I&#39;m interested in hearing your plans for when you graduate. Are you looking to go down the Indie games development route? Looking to join a big game studio? Applying for one of the big four? Creating a startup? I&#39;m personally planning on working on indie games. I frequent games discussions and was fortunate enough to attend one yesterday with some devs from Valve, Ubisoft and a few other indie studios. 

If you&#39;re thinking about doing compsci at uni too, feel free to ask any of us questions. It&#39;s extremely difficult to decide what you want to do when you leave school. I was lucky enough to study as a mature age student after testing all the waters possible and I&#39;m sure a lot of people here have some sound advice as well.

There&#39;s really no reason why we shouldn&#39;t be doing a little networking here. If you&#39;ve already graduated and you&#39;re currently working on a decent project, then also feel free to share.

I’m only in first-year university up here in Canada studying CS. Since I’m only a first-year, I haven’t actually specialized yet but I have an interest in operating systems and still, the web.</p>
<p>For anyone interested in finding a university in Canada feel free to PM me or something as I can give you some information about some of them.<br>

Actually that’s how it is here in Australia too. You don’t choose a specialization until 2nd year. However when you enroll/apply you <span class="bbcode-b">nominate</span> a specialization. You’re not required to actually choose the specialization until 2nd year enrollment, but you are required to nominate what you are planning to specialization in.</p>
<p>In my opinion it’s nicer this way. I don’t know how it is Canada but you can elect to take specialization courses as early as your first study period. I took the 2nd year math unit in my first semester of CS.[/quote]</p>
<p>Interesting, however I don’t know if we take the specialization route because looking at what courses I have to take in second year, they are more general CS courses such as: logic and computation, algorithm design, data structures, etc. Nonetheless, in upper years there is a wide variety of courses so I guess specializing can be done in third+ years.</p>

              <p>I hope to do sports science in a few years or anything with a focus on sports development based technology. So it could be things like performance analysis systems, tracking systems, scoring systems and so on. I’ve also thought about mobile apps for sport related stuff, like score systems, coaching tools (timers etc), route planners for exercise, timetables for work outs. Even the advertising and media side of sports interests me, I hope to work for people like Sky sports news, BBC news etc.</p>
<p>I think that technology within sport is a very recent development and a job involving them both would be lots of fun. Sport is relying more on technology every year.</p>
<p>I bet you never expected that, huh?</p>

There are plenty of small development companies. I know a printing company that has 3 people and they bank in 16k a month.</p>

              <p>I’m currently in college now, going for a general Associate’s degree and then gearing my Bachelor’s and Master’s towards computer science or programming. After these degrees or even during the schooling aspect of the degrees, I’m planning on joining any company and write programs for them. I’m particularly not wanting to get involved with game development until I feel 100% ready for that. Just a simple job, working with a company’s IT team and writing programs to help further that company’s technical branch.</p>
<p>Programming is something that I love to do, it’s actually quite enjoyable to learn and to be able to get paid to practice my skills would just be amazing.</p>

<p>I’m currently employed in quite a big company as their mobile app developer for their product, but I do help with their main product sometimes.
