    <title>[Tut] [SCAR] DTMs Made Easy In 10 Steps - By USMC</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tut-scar-dtms-made-easy-in-10-steps-by-usmc/8766</link>
    <description>Ever had trouble with finding a specific colour in an area with similar colours?
Or have bitmaps not been able to hack it? 
Well then, DTM&#39;s are for you! They may seem scary on the outside, but really they&#39;re easy!

DTM stands for [COLOR=&quot;Red&quot;]Deformable Template Model[/COLOR], they are used very much like bitmaps and are stored as a string in the script, however,
what a DTM does is, instead of taking one colour and searching for it, it takes a number different points, near to eachother, and matches those instead, usally resulting in finding the actual colour you want!

DTMs are good for finding a specific colour in a crowded place or good for auto colour finding.
Here i will explain how to make a simple DTM to find the colour of a tree minimap symbol.

[B]1)[/B] First of all I will log into runescape, and go to a rare tree symbol on the minimap.

[B]2)[/B] I open up scar and move it over so it is not obstructing my desired area on runescape.

[B]3)[/B] Now I will go to: Tools --&gt; DTM Editor:

[B]4)[/B] After clicking on DTM editor I should hopefully be presented with a window that looks somthing like this: (Note - you can now logout of runescape.)

[IMG]http://www.flax0r.info/images/tut/image02.png[/img]


[B]5)[/B] As you move over the image with your cursor you&#39;ll notice a sort of zoomed in view of where you are pointing, position your cursor over the main colour of your desired object, mine being the minimap symbol, spend time looking at the zoomed in window to make sure you get the right colour, when you are happy with it, click it. we have just selected the [COLOR=&quot;Red&quot;]parent[/COLOR] colour.

[B]6)[/B] you will now see that some text and a colour has appeared in the window on the right, in my case &quot;(769,217,94997)&quot; appeared, this denotes the (x-axis value,y-axis value,colour), you dont need to worry about this too much but its, handy to know, you&#39;ll also see a flashing dot appear where you clicked on the image, this is just to help you see where you have put the points.
Now, select the colour you just picked as the parent, this will tell the script which is the main colour it is try to match.

[B]7)[/B] Now select some more points ( try not to select over 7 in total ), try to get some unique points, in my case where the green meets the black:
[CENTER][IMG]http://www.flax0r.info/images/tut/image05.png[/img][/CENTER]
Once you are happy with your points you can go to: Test -&gt; Show Matching Pixels, the areas which scar matches to the DTM will be shown in red,
 if you are happy with this continue, if not, create new points or change the tolerance!

[IMG]http://www.flax0r.info/images/tut/image06.png[/img]


[B]8)[/B] Now for the good bit, go: File -&gt; DTM To Text:

[IMG]http://www.flax0r.info/images/tut/image07.png[/img]
Now exit the DTM editor.
You&#39;ll notice that some code, being the DTM string has been entered into the debug box, copy this into the main SCAR window.
Now I&#39;m going to rename my DTM as &quot;TreeSym&quot;, and declare it as an integer variable.
Next im going to put the DTM string into a procedure called &quot;LoadDTM&quot;.
Your code should look somthing like this so far:
[CODE]program New;

var
 TreeSym :Integer;
 
Procedure LoadDTM;
begin
  TreeSym := DTMFromString(&#39;78DA6364646660B8C98002188B1921348C0F5&#39; +
             &#39;27317558D9E182BAA1A16A09A7BA86A264D9A8AAA8601D31C0C35&#39; +
             &#39;2073AEA1AAD9B4692B8A1A0040B50AB4&#39;);
end;


begin
end.[/CODE]


[B]9)[/B] Now we need to make a procedure to actually find the DTM itself, I&#39;m going to use the function:
FindDTM(DTM: Integer; var x, y: Integer; x1, y1, x2, y2: Integer)
This will find the DTM in a set of given coordinates.
now i&#39;m going to to use an if statement so  i can see if SCAR finds the DTM.
Also i musn&#39;t forget to declare x and y as variables.
my final code looks like this:

[CODE]program FindTreeSymbol;

var
 TreeSym, x, y :Integer;
 
Procedure LoadDTM;
begin
  TreeSym := DTMFromString(&#39;78DA6364646660B8C98002188B1921348C0F5&#39; +
             &#39;27317558D9E182BAA1A16A09A7BA86A264D9A8AAA8601D31C0C35&#39; +
             &#39;2073AEA1AAD9B4692B8A1A0040B50AB4&#39;);
end;

Procedure FindTree;
begin
  if(FindDTM(TreeSym, x, y, 558, 2, 732, 164))then
   WriteLn(&#39;Tree Found! :D&#39;);
end;

begin
  LoadDTM;
  FindTree;
end.[/CODE]


[B]9)[/B] Login, select the runescape window and run play on SCAR:
[CODE]User specified a new RS window
Successfully compiled
Tree Found! :D
Successfully executed[/CODE]
Well done!
You now know how to use DTM&#39;s! :thrashi:
Hope my tut helped!</description>

<p>Also… Bitmaps seem to be too laggy for me so i dont know wat to do</p>
<p>Can You Also Explain the FindDTM function, like what the numbers mean:?</p>

              <p>thanks for this, DTMs will probably help clear up all my getcolors and findcolors. also im wondering, is there a way to turn a string back into a DTM because Id like to see the DTMs that other scripts have made.</p>
<p>DTMs are no so useful in the minimap like you showed because the color keeps on changing, but they could be useful for finding the corners of stuff like right-click popups and bank screens. I think SRL uses a few DTMs in its “clickoption” to find the corners and place them in “istextinareaex”</p>
<p>all in all, very good and useful  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

              <p>yes nice TUT, but when i made my first DTM and still having this problem <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> Scar Wouldn’t find it!!<br>
i’ve crated it to be very detailed and no more than 7 points i’ve even set to tolerance(10) and area(5), but it still wouldn’t find it! but then when i make DTM for other non color changing things like desktop icon it works. so my question is what should the tolerance and area be when scar could find my DTM in Runescape? and plz post an image of similar color and area is possible thx.</p>

              <p>Ever had trouble with finding a specific colour in an area with similar colours?<br>
Or have bitmaps not been able to hack it?<br>
Well then, DTM’s are for you! They may seem scary on the outside, but really they’re easy!</p>
<p>DTM stands for [COLOR=“Red”]Deformable Template Model[/COLOR], they are used very much like bitmaps and are stored as a string in the script, however,<br>
what a DTM does is, instead of taking one colour and searching for it, it takes a number different points, near to eachother, and matches those instead, usally resulting in finding the actual colour you want!</p>
<p>DTMs are good for finding a specific colour in a crowded place or good for auto colour finding.<br>
Here i will explain how to make a simple DTM to find the colour of a tree minimap symbol.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">1)</span> First of all I will log into runescape, and go to a rare tree symbol on the minimap.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">2)</span> I open up scar and move it over so it is not obstructing my desired area on runescape.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">3)</span> Now I will go to: Tools --&gt; DTM Editor:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.flax0r.info/images/tut/image01.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">4)</span> After clicking on DTM editor I should hopefully be presented with a window that looks somthing like this: (Note - you can now logout of runescape.)</p>
<p><img src="http://www.flax0r.info/images/tut/image02.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">5)</span> As you move over the image with your cursor you’ll notice a sort of zoomed in view of where you are pointing, position your cursor over the main colour of your desired object, mine being the minimap symbol, spend time looking at the zoomed in window to make sure you get the right colour, when you are happy with it, click it. we have just selected the [COLOR=“Red”]parent[/COLOR] colour.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">6)</span> you will now see that some text and a colour has appeared in the window on the right, in my case “(769,217,94997)” appeared, this denotes the (x-axis value,y-axis value,colour), you dont need to worry about this too much but its, handy to know, you’ll also see a flashing dot appear where you clicked on the image, this is just to help you see where you have put the points.<br>
Now, select the colour you just picked as the parent, this will tell the script which is the main colour it is try to match.</p>
<p>[CENTER]<img src="http://www.flax0r.info/images/tut/image04.png" alt width="" height="">[/CENTER]<br>
<img src="http://www.flax0r.info/images/tut/image03.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">7)</span> Now select some more points ( try not to select over 7 in total ), try to get some unique points, in my case where the green meets the black:<br>
[CENTER]<img src="http://www.flax0r.info/images/tut/image05.png" alt width="" height="">[/CENTER]<br>
Once you are happy with your points you can go to: Test -&gt; Show Matching Pixels, the areas which scar matches to the DTM will be shown in red,<br>
if you are happy with this continue, if not, create new points or change the tolerance!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.flax0r.info/images/tut/image06.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">8)</span> Now for the good bit, go: File -&gt; DTM To Text:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.flax0r.info/images/tut/image07.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
Now exit the DTM editor.<br>
You’ll notice that some code, being the DTM string has been entered into the debug box, copy this into the main SCAR window.<br>
Now I’m going to rename my DTM as “TreeSym”, and declare it as an integer variable.<br>
Next im going to put the DTM string into a procedure called “LoadDTM”.<br>
Your code should look somthing like this so far:</p>
<p>[CODE]program New;</p>
<p>var<br>
TreeSym :Integer;</p>
<p>Procedure LoadDTM;<br>
begin<br>
TreeSym := DTMFromString(‘78DA6364646660B8C98002188B1921348C0F5’ +<br>
‘27317558D9E182BAA1A16A09A7BA86A264D9A8AAA8601D31C0C35’ +<br>
‘2073AEA1AAD9B4692B8A1A0040B50AB4’);<br>
end;</p>
<p>begin<br>
end.[/CODE]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">9)</span> Now we need to make a procedure to actually find the DTM itself, I’m going to use the function:<br>
FindDTM(DTM: Integer; var x, y: Integer; x1, y1, x2, y2: Integer)<br>
This will find the DTM in a set of given coordinates.<br>
now i’m going to to use an if statement so  i can see if SCAR finds the DTM.<br>
Also i musn’t forget to declare x and y as variables.<br>
my final code looks like this:</p>
<p>[CODE]program FindTreeSymbol;</p>
<p>var<br>
TreeSym, x, y :Integer;</p>
<p>Procedure LoadDTM;<br>
begin<br>
TreeSym := DTMFromString(‘78DA6364646660B8C98002188B1921348C0F5’ +<br>
‘27317558D9E182BAA1A16A09A7BA86A264D9A8AAA8601D31C0C35’ +<br>
‘2073AEA1AAD9B4692B8A1A0040B50AB4’);<br>
end;</p>
<p>Procedure FindTree;<br>
begin<br>
if(FindDTM(TreeSym, x, y, 558, 2, 732, 164))then<br>
WriteLn(‘Tree Found! :D’);<br>
end;</p>
<p>begin<br>
LoadDTM;<br>
FindTree;<br>
end.[/CODE]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">9)</span> Login, select the runescape window and run play on SCAR:</p>
<p><code>User specified a new RS window
Successfully compiled
Tree Found! :D
Successfully executed</code><br>
Well done!<br>
You now know how to use DTM’s! :thrashi:<br>
Hope my tut helped!</p>
