...

I&#39;ve been brainstorming recently and i thought of this minigmae (survivor)  i&#39;m going to need &quot;some&quot; help coding it...

let&#39;s begin.

OBJECTIVE
--------------
The objective of the minigame is to kill the survivor of the last match...

if it is the first match and no one has played then a random person will be selected to be the survivor...

(did i mention the survivor has 500hp and major strength bonus?)

that will make the game more exciting... and getting rewards.

at the end of the match everyone will be teleported back into the waiting room.
...


WAITING ROOM
----------------

the waiting room will be survivor vs all  unless 10 or more are playing.

if 10 or more are playing the game will change to &quot;team survivor&quot; in which that case there will be two teams

and 1 survivor (team captain) on each team. that is when i will upgrade the hp of both survivors to 750hp and give 

him more strength bonus.

...

if not getting a &quot;reward&quot; after each game i might make a shop kind of like barbarian assault but with

&quot;survivor points&quot; 

and the payouts will include rares that give strength bonuses.

...

FAQ
----------

Q. what if the survivor wins?

A. depending how long the game was and how many players were in the game determine on how many points he gets. I will probably make it
where how many players were fighting against him that counts to his points ... for example... there are 5 players playing not including the
survivor.. he kills 5 players he gets 5 points.

Q. what if the players fighting against the survivor win?

A. if the players win they all get 1 point each.

Q. what will the rewards be?

A. I was thinking about having experience points (probably 10k in a combat skill of your choice) and some rares that give major strength bonus.

Q. What would happen if the survivor kills all but he dies too?

A. then no one will get the points.


...


This is not near finished. i will be putting my time and effort into this new minigame.

if anyone would like to help me and get credit for helping me in this minigame I would love your help.

...


YES! I will be uploading pictures today or tomorrow... i&#39;m on a plane right now (on my way to houston, Texas) about to land(:


anyways thanks for reading this and i hope you like my ideas..

any thoughts of your own that could improve this new mini game would really help me(:

please no flaming me, it&#39;s pointless and no one likes it.</description>
