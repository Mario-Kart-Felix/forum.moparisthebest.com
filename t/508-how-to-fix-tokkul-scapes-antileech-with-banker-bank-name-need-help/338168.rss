              <p>Look have you read what you said? look you said this</p><blockquote>"people that posted this on MOPARSCAPE downloads posted it"</blockquote><br>
^^ that means anyone can just post a source/client that isn’t theirs<br>
also
<blockquote>"it with the antileech it wasn't owned by that actual person so obviously the person dont give a shit about getting credits"</blockquote>
When you say that the person who doesn't give a shit is the poster because its not there client/source they spent time working on it so next time proofread what you say please.
