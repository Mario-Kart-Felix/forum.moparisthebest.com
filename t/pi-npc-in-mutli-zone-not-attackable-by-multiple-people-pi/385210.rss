    <description>I&#39;m trying to make it so that a jungle demon [code]npc id = 1472[/code] can be attacked by multiple people, just like you can do at corporeal beast. I made the area a multi zone but whenever a 2nd person trys to attack it a message comes up saying &quot;This monster is already under attack.&quot; How do I make it so that multiple people can attack that npc?


Nevermind problem solved!

for anyone else who needs help you have to put the (inMulti()) coordinates for your location in both the player.java file and the npc.java file.</description>

              <p>I know for that you have to declare the zone multi, you do that in NPC.java and Player.java</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">(absX &gt;= 2576 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 2580 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 9902 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 9885)</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">(absX &gt;= farthest west coord, absX &lt;= farthest east coord, absY &gt;= farthest north coord, absY &lt;= farthest south coord)</code></pre>
<p>What I cannot figure out is when I try to add “c.heightLevel” to it, the multi doesn’t work… :S</p>
