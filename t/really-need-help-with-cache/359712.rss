    <title>Really Need Help with Cache!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/really-need-help-with-cache/359712</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been trying to at least get one response to my question for the past few days, and I still haven&#39;t received any. Maybe the question is just too complicated, but I&#39;d be more than appreciative if someone can give me a little help with my problem.

I downloaded Tom&#39;s Cache Suite a little while ago, and I&#39;m trying to use it for my 562 cache. I know it&#39;s is a little outdated for a 562 server and cache, but with a little work, it&#39;s not impossible to update it. Here&#39;s my question, though: does Jagex still use their old implementation of BZip2 for their cache? I know Tom&#39;s uses BZip2 to decrypt the Jagex cache archives, but I&#39;m not sure if 562 cache still uses the same architecture. Can anyone help?</description>
