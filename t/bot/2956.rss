<p>Hmmm…<br>
You want to write a bot…</p>
<p>Why not just learn to teach a dog how to talk… That would be quite a bit easier…</p>
<p>You need so much java knowledge to even get close to writing a bot and understand it. It took me about 2-4 months to actually understand basic java scripting and to understand what objects were. With this new update you are definitely not going to find any tutorials or whatever to make the bot as it is so new…</p>
<p>It will just take ages for you to do it!</p>
<p>Come back in about 4 months time when you have got the hang of java then we will help then…</p>
<p>That ok???</p>
