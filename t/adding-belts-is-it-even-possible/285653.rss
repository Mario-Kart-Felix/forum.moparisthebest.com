    <title>Adding belts... is it even possible?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-belts-is-it-even-possible/285653</link>
    <description>I have a 317 server, and I&#39;m not an expert at clients, but could I add belts to the client\server?
Heres my protocal of the dragon belt, It took me like 5 seconds.

I want to know if I could mess around with the client (or server) files and make the equipting tab look something like this.

Just a small edit in the necklace slot.

I&#39;m not afraid of a challenge, I just need to know if it&#39;s possible, and where to start.
Thanks to anyone who helps.</description>

<p>Do you name of the source you found the extra equipment slot in? Sounds like it would be a place to start.[br][br]<br>

But those are 508’s. You think it could work for a 317?<br>
And i never found lords throne room, only devolution.</p>

Yeah, but those are all already in place. Wings go in cape area, and you can just make more necklace and ring slots. I’m talking about belts, a whole new slot on your waist. It’s going to be a lot more harder to code then wings or another necklace, etc.</p>
