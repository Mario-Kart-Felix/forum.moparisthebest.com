    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-npcs-dropping-stuff-rep-if-you-figure-it-out/425129</link>
    <description>idk wtf is up with my npc drops. well tbh ive never done them on a PI. just started my first PI and im making a thing like tutorial island. the only last bit i need is making a chicked drop an item. ive followed all tutorials. and its ganna be a shame if 160 dialogues later i&#39;d have to change it...
heres my npcdrop file thing. not the config i forget what it is. but this is where u put it.
[code]#Man drops
1:1	995:100	554:100
#Guard drops
9:1	995:250	555:100
#Chicken drops
41:100	14892:1
#Penguin drops
131:100	995:200000 537:1[/code]
thats only a few of the list, but each of these works, and the chicken doesnt. im trying to make it drop an artefact every time to teach a player about item interaction. i have the item all set uo, but the chicken just wont drop it...</description>
