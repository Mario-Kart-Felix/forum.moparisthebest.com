                                                                                  [b]By:GamersTips[/b]
                                                                                        [b](scott)[/b]

                                                (I have already made a server, but i will be making another one for this thread)
                                                                          
[b]Chapter.1 Getting Your Server[/b]

[b]Chapter.2 Getting a Server IP[/b]

[b]Chapter.3 Editing Your Server[/b]

                                   [b]Getting Your Server[/b]
Ok, to start your server, you must download MoparScape, you can get it here
http://rs95.rapidshare.com/files/28641428/MoparScapeInstall.exe

                                   [b]Getting a Server IP[/b]
Ok, once you have downloaded moparscape, you need to register at No-ip.com Heres the link
http://www.no-ip.com/

Once you have registered, log in, then click on add host

[img]http://img34.picoodle.com/img/img34/4/7/12/f_ruescapem_449f809.png[/img]

Once you have done that, Enter the name of your game, name it anything you want. FOR EXAMPLE: (your name)scape (I will be naming mine  pwnzorkscape)

[img]http://img34.picoodle.com/img/img34/4/7/12/f_ruescapem_3e0a8b1.png[/img]

once you have done that, select your no.ip.whatever
(Dont use any of the other choices, only use no-ip.org, no-ip.biz, or no-ip.info, because the other ones lagg, and dont work well)

[img]http://img34.picoodle.com/img/img34/4/7/12/f_ruescapem_88363b5.png[/img]

Then enter your IP adress

[img]http://img34.picoodle.com/img/img34/4/7/12/f_ruescapem_942eb85.png[/img]

Once you have done that, scroll down, then click create host.

[img]http://img34.picoodle.com/img/img34/4/7/12/f_ruescapem_f7b3d75.png[/img]

Ok, you have made your (name).no-ip.whatever, remember that, now open moparscape

[img]http://img34.picoodle.com/img/img34/4/7/12/f_ruescapem_c9d0058.png[/img]

click start server, than click ok

then click enter

put in any username and password, then you will see it say 127.0.0.1, back space that, and put your IP. (what you named your ip).no-ip.(what you chose)

you should be right here

[img]http://img34.picoodle.com/img/img34/4/7/12/f_ruescapem_305f3e7.png[/img]

                                                 


                                                   [b]Editing Your Server[/b]

Ok, now were getting to the beef of this project, teleport to varock, and go to thessalia, and trade her.

[img]http://img34.picoodle.com/img/img34/4/7/12/f_ruescapem_3cd3c0f.png[/img]

Right now, we are going to make your own shop.
Open your moparscape file, and open hybridscape file.

[img]http://img34.picoodle.com/img/img34/4/7/12/f_ruescapem_da48b87.png[/img]

Then open your shop file, it wont open by itself, so open it with notepad

[img]http://img34.picoodle.com/img/img34/4/7/12/f_ruescapem_83e124f.png[/img]

Then find the sentance Thessalia_Fine_Clothes (you dont need to use find option)

[img]http://img34.picoodle.com/img/img34/4/7/12/f_ruescapem_22192f9.png[/img]

Rename that shop to whatever you want, when you do a space, use _ FOR EXAPLE: Example_Shop

[img]http://img34.picoodle.com/img/img34/4/7/12/f_ruescapem_1b85964.png[/img]

Now, your going to put items in your shop

The same line you changed the name of the shop, scroll to the right, and find the number 1005, and next to that, should be a 3

[img]http://img34.picoodle.com/img/img34/4/7/12/f_ruescapem_f471181.png[/img]

Change the 1005 to 1050 (thats a santa hat code) and the 3, change the 3 to how many santa hats you want in your shop

Save the file, and log out

Exit MoparScape

And log back on

And the shop should be diffrent

<p>Exactly. Anyways wrong section. And this is like the 200th tutorial of this on these forums. I think we know by now. And FYI most people use 474 servers or lower servers/clients now, I don’t think anyone uses MoparScape anymore.</p>
