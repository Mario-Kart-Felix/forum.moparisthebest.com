    <title>[718] Java problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-java-problem/491925</link>
    <description>So my friend has just upgraded the server we&#39;ve been working on for about 2 months now to 718. When I got the new client, I couldn&#39;t play it. It gave me the standard &quot;java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: client : Unsupported major.minor version 51.0&quot; which is saying that it&#39;s compiled in a higher version of Java than I have (6_41)

However, we can&#39;t seem to figure out why I still cannot run it, as he has compiled in 6 a bunch of times trying to get me able to run it. It&#39;s normally just a simple jar, but we&#39;ve tried doing all sorts of stuff. 

He&#39;s on the RuneTek 5 engine, which apparently means he can&#39;t use 6 on the server. But I don&#39;t see why that means I can&#39;t run the client itself.

If anybody knows what&#39;s going on, that would be fantastic. :)</description>
