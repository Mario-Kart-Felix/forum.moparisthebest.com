    <title>Newbie problem: Getting the client to work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/newbie-problem-getting-the-client-to-work/509224</link>
    <description>Hi there, im using Deathlypvpz v3 by hack3r.
Im quite new to this so forgive me if im asking something stupid, but i can&#39;t seem to get the client to work.
This is the error:

[img]http://i45.tinypic.com/28akj89.png[/img]

I&#39;ve changed the paths of the files to the right location, and turning on the source works fine.
However, i keep getting this error when trying to execute the client.

I&#39;ve went into the client.java to change all the ip&#39;s to &#39;localhost&#39; etc, didnt work.

I looked at where the error seemed to be, and i ended up at lines that look like this one:
[code]
			signlink.startpriv(InetAddress.getLocalHost());[/code]

I don&#39;t understand what this does, nor how i fix it.

Could anyone possibly help me with this?</description>

<p>You know when you were putting in the relevant IPs, did you type in 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1 (or is it 127.0.1, I used to type 0.0.0.0 so I’ve forgotten sorry lol).</p>

<li>You seem like a nice guy based on your post, I just felt like letting you know :p.</li>

<p>First of all thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>No there is no x86 in the client file<br>
This is the client content: <code>@echo off
title Client
cd ./locandclass/
"C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.7.0_11/bin/java" -Xmx512m client 10 0 highmem members 64
pause</code></p>
