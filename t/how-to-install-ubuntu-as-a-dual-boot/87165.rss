    <description>[center][size=14pt][b]How to install Ubuntu as a Dual Boot[/b][/size]
by Ron[/center]

[b]Tutorial last checked with Ubuntu 7.10 and the tutorial still works perfectly![/b]

[b]My Ubuntu/Kubuntu Screenshots:[/b]
Ubuntu (GDE - Gnome style) - http://www.hotlinkfiles.com/public/view/full/2024
Kubuntu (KDE - K style) - http://www.hotlinkfiles.com/public/view/full/2022

This tutorial will explain how to install [url=http://www.ubuntu.com]Ubuntu[/url] or [url=http://www.kubuntu.org/]Kubuntu[/url] or even [url=http://www.xubuntu.org]Xubuntu[/url] as a dual boot with your Windows Operating System.

[b]What is Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Xubuntu?[/b]
Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Xubuntu are all Linux operating systems by Canonical. For more information go to their [url=http://www.ubuntu.com]main website[/url].

[b]What is a Dual Boot?[/b]
A dual boot is when you have more than one operating system on your computer. Examples of perating systems (OS) are Microsoft&#39;s Windows XP, Apple&#39;s Mac OS X, and Sun&#39;s Solaris.

[b]If you do not want to go through the hassle of partitioning and putting the .iso file on a CD, there is hope! Try this, but note, [u]this has not been tried by me[/u], so I&#39;m not sure of it&#39;s success rate.[/b]
To install, all you do is stay on your Windows OS, and then run an EXE file, follow the instructions, and finally install. Reboot, and you can use Ubuntu! Currently in the tutorial, there are dead links that should be pointing to: http://www.wubi-installer.org/
Tutorial: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=427540

[b]The Following are Required for this Tutorial:[/b] 
[b]Edit Aug 25, 2010: I strongly suggest anyone who needs to partition anything, use [url=http://gparted.sourceforge.net/]GParted[/url]. This software is very stable yet still will prompt you to backup your system (like all partitioners). It&#39;s better than Partition Manager because it&#39;s been developed for a long time, works for me, Open Source, and has a cool live CD so it doesn&#39;t need to be installed. Works like a charm. :)[/b]

1. [url=http://www.torrentz.ws/torrent/291126/Paragon-Partition-Manager-Pro-8-5-Retail]Paragon Partition Manager[/url] installed on your Windows OS.
2. You need to have at least 10 GB to spare for this tutorial.
3. The install CD of your Ubuntu Linux OS. For this tutorial, I used the Ubuntu Live CD and then installed KDE to get Kubuntu. To get that, go to Ubuntu&#39;s [url=http://www.ubuntu.com]Main Website[/url] and download the correct ISO file! Once you have that, get a blank CD-R, download [url=http://www.imgburn.com]ImgBurn[/url], and follow [url=http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61]these instructions[/url] (or [url=http://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=guides]these[/url]) to plant the image. 

[b]Note: There was some confusion earlier on this. When I say 1 GB that is equivalent to 1000 MB, so if they ask you any questions using MB, you will know what to do if I say GB. ;)[/b]

[b]The Tutorial[/b]
So far this has had a 100% success rate! I tried it on both my computers and it worked on a Pentium 4 which is my new one, and my old one which is a Pentium 2. Ubuntu runs pretty fast on both of them! Just follow these steps and everything will work out fine. If you have a question on any of these steps, do not hesitate to ask. If it&#39;s a prominent discrepancy then I will add more information to the step as to not confuse others. Estimated time of completion is about an hour to safely install Ubuntu as a dual boot.

1. There is a very slim chance of anything going wrong, but the slim chance of something bad happening, I will have to ask you to please back up any files that are important on your computer!  :) Better safe than sorry. Before I started this tutorial, I saved all important files to my 1 GB USB Memory Stick. 
2. Download, install, and open Paragon Partition Manager.
3. Resize your NTFS partition (normally your C:\ drive) by right clicking on it and clicking on Move/Resize partition. Allocate at least 10 GB and then click on Yes.
4. Now to create the Linux partition. At the top, click on Wizards &gt; Create Partition. Click on Next and then click on the unallocated space you created in the last step. Click Next again, and then make sure to format it as Linux ext3.
5. Resize the newly created partition and leave about 2 GB unallocated. 
6. Create another partition out of the 2 GB unallocated and format it as swap. Here is a picture of my partitions. Focus your attention on the bottom 2 partitions in this picture because those are the ones I created to install Ubuntu. 
[center][img]http://img254.imageshack.us/img254/5274/ronspartitionszk0.png[/img][/center]

7. After you have finished, click on Apply at the top right. The changes should now take affect. If by any chance it gives an error, then just click on the &quot;Restart&quot; button which will restart and apply the changes on boot.
8. Once you have rebooted or the changes have begun -- this may take a while -- so make sure to go outside and have some fun or something. It may take 20 min on an old computer, but should be relatively fast on a new one.

[center]Once it&#39;s finished your computer will be ready for Ubuntu! When it is, continue with this tutorial.[/center]

9. Pop in your Live Install CD you made earlier, and reboot once again. Your computer should now load the Live CD. Once it does, select the option to use the Live CD and install. If loading the Live CD does not work, then press F2 when you reboot to enter your boot settings in order to set them to the drive your Live CD is in.
10. Once the Live CD&#39;s Linux is up, double click on the Install icon on your desktop.  These next few steps are very important.
11. Follow the installation&#39;s instructions up until the partitioning part!  once you get to this part, set the option to [b]manual[/b] and click on next.
12. You will now see your drives, probably 3 or 4. Make sure that formatting your Windows drive [b]IS NOT[/b] set! [b]ONLY[/b] check the Linux ext3 formatted drive. Right click on the Linux ext3 drive and select &quot;Edit Partition.&quot;
13. Make sure the new space in MB is the same as how much you allocated to that drive. Make sure the format is also set to ext3 and set it to mount as &quot;/&quot; (root).
14. Follow the remaining steps and instructions of the Install and everything will be [b]Perfectly Installed[/b]!

[b]Ron, my Ubuntu is working fine, but what&#39;s next? How do I... ?[/b]
The answer to all your problems is the [url=http://www.ubuntuguide.org]Ubuntu Guide[/url]. Shows you how to install [url=http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Feisty#How_to_install_J2SE_Runtime_Environment_.28JRE.29_v6.0_with_Plug-in_for_Mozilla_Firefox]Java[/url] (to play RuneScape), [url=http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Feisty#How_to_install_Flash_Player_.28Macromedia_Flash.29_Plug-in_for_Mozilla_Firefox]Flash Player[/url] (to play those other fun web games), [url=http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Feisty#How_to_Install_Wine]WINE[/url] (The Windows Emulator), and many other things! 

[b]But Ron! I have a big problem![/b]
If you have any big problems with applications or Ubuntu or something, you can refer to the nice people at the [url=http://www.ubuntuforums.org]Ubuntu Forums[/url] Although if it was a problem that has something to do with this tutorial, then please post.

[b]For Anything Else[/b]
Comments? Problems in this tutorial? Please post in this topic. :) Comments are always appreciated. Also it would be really helpful if anyone could get me some more screenshots of Ubuntu. To create a screenshot, just hit the &quot;Print Screen&quot; button right above your &quot;Insert&quot; button on your keyboard. If you send it my way, I&#39;ll of course, add you to credits and add the picture. Thank you.

              <p>Hey guys, forgot about this old post. I’ve heard GParted is a great Open Source partition manager that does not have the many issues that proprietary software like Partition Manager and I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>All you have to do is make a live boot CD for GParted, then boot into it, follow my steps posted …generally, not exactly since it’s different software:</p>
<ol>
<li>lower the size of a partition</li>
<li>format the unallocated space to EXT3 or EXT4, reboot</li>
<li>pop out GParted Live CD</li>
<li>pop in Ubuntu live CD, install Ubuntu over the partition that was just created by Manually editing the partition on the live CD, do not let Ubuntu automatically do it.</li>
<li>Everything is installed fine.</li>
</ol>
<p>I had a few problems from Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic where my sound stopped work, wireless issues, etc. I had about 80 GBs on the 9.10 partition and another 80 on my Vista partition. I installed 10.04 (w/o GParted and luckily for me it didn’t erase any data but have heard many horror stories, Idk why I risked it but anyway, it worked) and my sound and wireless worked fine but that partition only has 20 GB, so now to save all my data from the other partitions, I thought of a new concept… to me: A SHARED PARTITION lol</p>
<p>I think I’m going to allocate 10 GBs for each of my operating systems. I’m removing Windows Vista, installing Windows XP &amp; 7, Mac OS X Snow Leopard, and will have Ubuntu. The rest of my hard drive will be a shared EXT2 or EXT3 (heard EXT2 is stable, EXT3 is better but w/ random problems, EXT4 has even more issues), then have Ubuntu/Mac/Windows automatically mount it and anytime I download movies/music and even games (playable via WINE). I can launch it from any OS I want and it will always be separate and in one place so I do not have to hunt around for my files!</p>
<p>How awesome is that idea. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> You get the best of all 4 worlds, slightly illegally.

If you can’t get Ubuntu to work then Linux isn’t for you and you should stick to simple things.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Not necessarily, some versions just don’t work well with certain computers.[/quote]</p>
<p>That is very true. I have an HP Laptop and when I installed the latest version of Ubuntu, version 8.10. A series of problems came about. Almost every time I had to reboot, it was because it was freezing. Fortunately not when I was doing school work. I have a desktop computer at my house and 8.10 works flawlessly on it. On the desktop, I have no problems with sound, mouse control, and freezes.</p>
<p>If you want to switch to anything, try Puppydog Linux if you want a very very small system. Very fast if you are a gamer.</p>

              <p>Trevor, in that picture you have your C drive partition selected that’s perfect. Now just resize it by decreasing the partition size. At that moment your partition size of your C drive was 184,828 MB. Lower that to 174,828 MB. That creates 10,000 MB (10 GB) of free space for your new Linux partition!</p>
