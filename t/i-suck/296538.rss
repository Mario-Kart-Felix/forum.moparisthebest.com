    <description>Alright so basically all I want is for a real person to double check that I have JDK properly installed on my computer with environment variables correct and everything.

SO here is what I&#39;ve got.

Installed JDK 6u14 to C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_14

Path variable: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_14\bin;.

Classpath didn&#39;t exist in system variables so i created it like this &quot;Classpath&quot; and for the value

Classpath variable: CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_14\bin;%CLASSPATH%;


Seriously thanks for helping.

Also now that I have Java installed, does that mean if I click the start new server button in moparscape and
use my internal IP (127.0.0.1) it will work? b/c i&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s a webclient right?

(I&#39;m asking this because i have so far been unsuccessful in playing in any private server in moparscape, including my internal IP address one from the Start Server button)


(and no I&#39;m not stupid nor retarded, I just don&#39;t know a lot about Java, and while I&#39;m all for reading, I appreciate the help from a real person more.)</description>
