    <description>Welcome to ElitePk! I&#39;m sure a few of you have been here before. You will notice we have a new look and alot of updates to our client. The game iteself has changed quite a bit. Before we had alot of extra features but nothing that would really blow you away. We Now have alot of extra cool features and hidden fun throughout the server.

I would like to welcome all the new players, and thank them for giving elitepk a shot. We have a stable economy, and i intend to keep it that way. The experience rates will always be high. The reason i do this is because most of the RSC players are over the age of 18. Because of this, most of us have jobs and don&#39;t have all that much time to spend raising stats just to get to a point in the game that is fun for us. Most player play RSC for Pking. Who can blame them? RSC has the best pking system out there (in my opinion) and for this, alot of players have stuck around. 

Because i have raised the Exp. Rates of my server, i have also increased the max level. If you played before you will remember the max stat being 140. I have lowered the max to 120, but have increased the experience array. That way, you can&#39;t run around hitting 70+ on people while pking. 

Previously in this server we had 3 new types of armour. we had Legendary (purple), Elite (green), and AK armour, which you could make any color you chose. I have eliminated legendary and elite from the game. Just leaving AK. The max stat has been set at 100 and you will find that getting it is not easy. It is not over powered like it was in my previous version. In fact it is just slightly better than rune, but effective enough to be worth your time. You&#39;ll have to find out how to get this armour yourself.

I have removed rares except for a few which a few monsters will drop very rarely. Finding these NPC&#39;s will be up to you. 

Dragon items are not easy to get either. I figure by doing this it will keep the economy stable. Getting a dragon axe or long won&#39;t be &quot;easy peasy&quot; anymore.

I have added a few new training areas which you can access by the levers on the south wall of edgeville. 4 in all, and alot more training areas aside from those. 

The KBD has been put in his original spot, just pull the lever under lessers to get to him. As of right now he only can be killed my mage or range, this may change in the future.

A new mini game has been added. A basic outline of it is: Collect 3 parchments scattered throughout the runescape world. High level NPC&#39;s will drop the scrolls, but very rarely. COllect all 3 and return to grim for your prize. 

You will find alot more to do once you start playing. Updates will be constant, but it won&#39;t be like before where i release a new client every other day. Client updates will be monthly, with lots of new updates available. 

To make the server enjoyable for everyone i would appreciate all your suggestions. If i don&#39;t know what you want, i can&#39;t really give it to you can i? 

Now the client, to download the client you must first register, that way you can become active on the forums. I will be portforwarding so i can run it off my computer for now, however it will be back on hamachi for the beta., until i can set up a dedi. other than that. I hope you all enjoy your stay here at ElitePk!

              <p>Welcome to ElitePk! I’m sure a few of you have been here before. You will notice we have a new look and alot of updates to our client. The game iteself has changed quite a bit. Before we had alot of extra features but nothing that would really blow you away. We Now have alot of extra cool features and hidden fun throughout the server.</p>
<p>I would like to welcome all the new players, and thank them for giving elitepk a shot. We have a stable economy, and i intend to keep it that way. The experience rates will always be high. The reason i do this is because most of the RSC players are over the age of 18. Because of this, most of us have jobs and don’t have all that much time to spend raising stats just to get to a point in the game that is fun for us. Most player play RSC for Pking. Who can blame them? RSC has the best pking system out there (in my opinion) and for this, alot of players have stuck around.</p>
<p>Because i have raised the Exp. Rates of my server, i have also increased the max level. If you played before you will remember the max stat being 140. I have lowered the max to 120, but have increased the experience array. That way, you can’t run around hitting 70+ on people while pking.</p>
<p>Previously in this server we had 3 new types of armour. we had Legendary (purple), Elite (green), and AK armour, which you could make any color you chose. I have eliminated legendary and elite from the game. Just leaving AK. The max stat has been set at 100 and you will find that getting it is not easy. It is not over powered like it was in my previous version. In fact it is just slightly better than rune, but effective enough to be worth your time. You’ll have to find out how to get this armour yourself.</p>
<p>I have removed rares except for a few which a few monsters will drop very rarely. Finding these NPC’s will be up to you.</p>
<p>Dragon items are not easy to get either. I figure by doing this it will keep the economy stable. Getting a dragon axe or long won’t be “easy peasy” anymore.</p>
<p>I have added a few new training areas which you can access by the levers on the south wall of edgeville. 4 in all, and alot more training areas aside from those.</p>
<p>The KBD has been put in his original spot, just pull the lever under lessers to get to him. As of right now he only can be killed my mage or range, this may change in the future.</p>
<p>A new mini game has been added. A basic outline of it is: Collect 3 parchments scattered throughout the runescape world. High level NPC’s will drop the scrolls, but very rarely. COllect all 3 and return to grim for your prize.</p>
<p>You will find alot more to do once you start playing. Updates will be constant, but it won’t be like before where i release a new client every other day. Client updates will be monthly, with lots of new updates available.</p>
<p>To make the server enjoyable for everyone i would appreciate all your suggestions. If i don’t know what you want, i can’t really give it to you can i?</p>
<p>Now the client, to download the client you must first register, that way you can become active on the forums. I will be portforwarding so i can run it off my computer for now, however it will be back on hamachi for the beta., until i can set up a dedi. other than that. I hope you all enjoy your stay here at ElitePk!</p>
