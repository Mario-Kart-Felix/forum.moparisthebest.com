    <title>Add quests to deltascape source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/add-quests-to-deltascape-source/352645</link>
    <description>Since my last post went unanswered..I will repost it, this time in a different way.

I have the source: deltascape. I need to know how to add quests. I have tried before and recieved an error saying: Cannot find symbol, but yet am using the same symbol as other quests that have been made. I need to know all the files that are involved in making quests. I am tired of looking threw files to see if I have to add anything for a quest. If anyone knows a good quest tut that would be awesome if you told me it. I have looked and havn&#39;t found one. ~Thanks!~  ;D</description>
