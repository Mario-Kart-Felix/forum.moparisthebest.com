    <title>Question about Moparscape Revolution</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-about-moparscape-revolution/1646</link>
    <description>Alright if this has already been answered I&#39;m sorry.  I spent about an hour searching before I broke down and posted this.  

How do you make it so it&#39;ll run in low detail?

Oh and Mopar, yeah I finally got it working on my computer.  I don&#39;t know what I did differently but, I reloaded it and it worked fine.  (I was the one from reinet that asked by the way)</description>
