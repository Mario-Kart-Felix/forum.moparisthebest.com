    <title>ANSWER: to npc shops wont trade</title>

    <description>If you have the same problem i did, where the shops wouldnt trade i can Help you XD

(I only tried it on my server, which is hustla source)

But what you have to do is make sure the shops are in the same position they were on the list as when you first got the source.

FOR EXAMPLE:
1. spawn = 494	2811	3443	0	0	0	0	0	1	Catherbay East Bank Male Banker3
2. spawn = 495	2810	3443	0	0	0	0	0	1	Catherbay East Bank Female Banker
3. spawn = 494	2809	3443	0	0	0	0	0	1	Catherbay East Bank Male Banker
4. spawn = 494	2807	3443	0	0	0	0	0	1	Catherbay East Bank Male Banker
5. spawn = 527	2804	3432	0	0	0	0	0	2	Catherbay General Store Shop Keeper


You have to make sure they always are in the same spot. like you cant delete 4. and the move 5 up...it has to be in the same line</description>
