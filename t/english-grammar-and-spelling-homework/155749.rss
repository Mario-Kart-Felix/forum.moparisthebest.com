&lt;blockquote&gt;Once upon a time there was a beautiful princes who

lived in the highest tower of her father&#39;s castle.

She was very lonely one day so, she sent word in a

bottle that she wished to escape and threw the

message out the window. It fell into the hands of a

handsome forester, he read the message. Then he

climbed the the high tower, the princess was overjoyed

to see him. Together they decided to jump into the

moat and swim to safety. They jumped and they were

smashed to bits because the moat was empty since it was a dry

year.

Moral: Look before you leap.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>Why did you make new lines in the middle of random sentences?  Chopping lines up like that doesn’t make prose into poetry.</p>
