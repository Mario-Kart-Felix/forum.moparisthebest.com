    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jammedscape-v3/312941</link>
    <description>ok sooo... You may or may not know me, but i am Darque Star (developer of JammedScape)
i have stopped developing for a while, but i am decided to start back up again.
Skills:
- Graphics Designing
- Java Coding/Scripting
- Loading Models
- and Much Much More

I need suggestions on what to do with the server, to make it the best, once again.
I will take in any suggestions, but i am not promising all of these suggestions are going to be in my server.
Even if you suggest something that you don&#39;t even think i can do, i will try my hardest to complete the server.

right now:
