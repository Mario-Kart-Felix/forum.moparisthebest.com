    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/charisma/529119</link>
    <description>Hello, everyone.

I&#39;d like to ask you: What is charisma?

Is it a person that a large group:

[ul][li]finds humorous?[/li]
[li]covets a skill/quality of theirs? (e.g. fitness[Zyzz], cooking[Gordon Ramsay], looks[Brad Pitt])?[/li]
[li]finds fun?[/li][/ul]


What to you defines charisma? Do you know anyone that &quot;brightens up the room&quot; as they walk in? Why do you think that is? And what&#39;s stopping you from doing the same?

Come on people, let&#39;s figure this out.</description>

<p>Right, no one likes someone who tries to be someone else, <span class="bbcode-i">but,</span> charismatic people do have traits in common. I think there’s a line between outright copying the way someone acts, and sharing a goal someone achieves by acting that way. Bear with me now.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Jesse says “woah” when something interesting happens, and his goal is (to show he is interested).</p>
<p>Nathan acts like other people, and thinks Jesse is cool, so when something interesting happens, he also starts saying “woah”.</p>
<p>Now Aaron, shares the same goal as Jesse (to show he is interested) and he raises his eyebrows when something interesting happens. He achieves the same thing as Jesse, but isn’t acting like someone else.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Now replace (showing interest)</span> with a charismatic trait.</p>
<p>See where I’m getting at?</p>

The term charisma (/kəˈrɪzmə/; pl. charismata, adj. charismatic) has two senses: (1) compelling attractiveness or charm that can inspire devotion in others, (2) a divinely conferred power or talent.[2]</p>

<p>Lol, anyone can identify a person as having charisma. Not many people can actually apply that knowledge and <span class="bbcode-i">be</span> charismatic. This is because no one asks <span class="bbcode-i">why</span> or <span class="bbcode-i">how</span> a person is that way. I think it can be taught and learned, but no school teaches this type of thing. Charisma is a skill involving more than one person, so what better way to learn the skill than in a forum dedicated to intellectual discussions?</p>
<p>I expected more people to show interest in this.</p>
