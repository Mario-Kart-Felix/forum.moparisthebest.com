    <title>Object reset?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/object-reset/331344</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;m not really sure how making this would work... but I was thinking of having it because fires don&#39;t vanish at ALL, and I was thinking of adding a timer for every 5 minutes they reset.

Would anyone know how to make this? :p</description>
