<p>the great thing about your country is it has no financial security or stability? dats sum nice logic you got der! in that model though, everyone lower than upper middle class will suffer, you cannot deny that</p>
<p>ps debt and poverty had little to do with the london riots, it was a small contribution sure but once the riots got into swing there’s a little thing called herd mentality which takes over, and it has been pointed out half of the fucking people rioting are using facebook, twitter and their fucking blackberries to communicate, poor people don’t get to have blackberries</p>
<p>pps I was going to get around to replying to you on a few of the “open discussions” we have going but every time I do the posts are usually 2-3 weeks old so ye!</p>

<p>A company would only raise salaries when they have to.  And I don’t see how taxing more would do any damage. Warren Buffett said himself that high taxes hadn’t done much damage earlier. Of course not too high.</p>

<p>The rich would be richer if the country had lower taxes. So how do they get rich because the government played a role?</p>
<p>But I personally would go more even more left, as the best way to control the economy is more state-controlled corporations. Then you don’t need to worry about out-sourcing and giving corporations tax breaks and hope they will create more jobs.</p>

<p>Sweden is one of the lucky countries that stuck to the idea of making sure they were exporting approximately the same worth they were importing.</p>
<p>I personally like the European model, but it isn’t long term at all.</p>

PS: Norway has more  dollar millionaires per capita than US, so someone here tries to be rich, even though they can’t be mega rich. (Yes, blame the oil, but your argument about nobody will try to get rich is failing).</p>
