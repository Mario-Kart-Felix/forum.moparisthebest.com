<p>No, not at all.  Desktop environments do not fall under Linux knowledge, they’re completely separate.  What you said would be the same as, “You’re talking about GPS, so I assumed you were talking about GPS devices that go in cars.  That would fall under car knowledge (not knowledge of GPS itself).”</p>
<p>Now, let me explain how it’s the same, seeing you’re a fucking retard.</p>
<p>You don’t need a GPS device in your car; just like you don’t need a desktop environment.<br>
Knowledge about GPS does not fall under knowledge of cars; just like knowledge of desktop environments does not fall under knowledge of Linux.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many different things a GPS can be used with, and the same goes with OSes and desktop environments.  You’re making an assumption which attempts to link two things.  Then, you’re saying knowledge about the things you linked falls under the category of what you linked it to; not the actual category it falls under.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So you’re saying someone who has never seen or heard of a Linux OS could install a desktop environment on the OS? You need some type of knowledge buddy, even if it’s not much.</p>
<p>/thread</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>For one, that has nothing to do with it at all, and is completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>But, to humor you, I’ll go back to the GPS analogy, you don’t need to know how to install a GPS device into a car to know about a GPS.  In addition, you don’t need to know about cars to install a GPS device (most of them anyway), seeing they run on batteries, and you can plug them into the cigarette lighter.  Neither of those situations require knowledge specific to cars, just like installing a desktop environment requires no knowledge specific to the OS.</p>
<p>As for installing a desktop enviornment, most distros install at least one by default, and all you have to do is go through the installation wizard.  Even if a specific distro didn’t you could find a tutorial on how to do it, and they’re detailed enough so you don’t need any Linux specific knowledge (you just need to know how to type, and follow directions).</p>
<p>Anyway, we can continue arguing semantics, but the bottom line is that RSCShadow doesn’t know shit about desktop environments, and there is no objective reason to display disgust towards KDE.</p>

<p>Dude, the whole point in my argument is you have to know some knowledge about linux. Saying “follow directions” makes my whole argument when I said “you need to know some linux commands” when YOU said you didn’t need to. It’s sad because you still don’t get it.</p>

<p>A desktop environment is not a process (not the kind you’re talking about anyway), nor is a GPS…  Also, how the fuck are you encrypting a desktop environment through SSH?

<p>Typing things that are explicitly given to you requires no Linux specific knowledge…  All it requires is the ability to type something exactly as you see it…  So, you don’t need to know any ‘Linux commands’ to install a desktop environment.

Anyone that can use simple reasoning can see you’ve in no way even come close to winning, and that everything you’ve said in this thread is completely, and utterly retarded; as usual.  As usual, you run from the argument because you’re getting completely owned, in every way imaginable.  When will you learn that you can’t win when you’re completely wrong from the beginning?</p>

<p>A) CodeForFame has lost his patience with the amount of stupidity he claims to see on these forums and has taken on the job of setting everyone in their place.</p>

<p>B) He’s being trolled hardcore in an attempt to shut him up, but instead continues to fuel his own anger by responding to every post that he takes on.</p>

<p>No, not at all.  Desktop environments do not fall under Linux knowledge, they’re completely separate.  What you said would be the same as, “You’re talking about GPS, so I assumed you were talking about GPS devices that go in cars.  That would fall under car knowledge (not knowledge of GPS itself).”</p>
<p>Now, let me explain how it’s the same, seeing you’re a fucking retard.</p>
<p>You don’t need a GPS device in your car; just like you don’t need a desktop environment.<br>
Knowledge about GPS does not fall under knowledge of cars; just like knowledge of desktop environments does not fall under knowledge of Linux.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many different things a GPS can be used with, and the same goes with OSes and desktop environments.  You’re making an assumption which attempts to link two things.  Then, you’re saying knowledge about the things you linked falls under the category of what you linked it to; not the actual category it falls under.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So you’re saying someone who has never seen or heard of a Linux OS could install a desktop environment on the OS? You need some type of knowledge buddy, even if it’s not much.</p>
<p>/thread</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>For one, that has nothing to do with it at all, and is completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>But, to humor you, I’ll go back to the GPS analogy, you don’t need to know how to install a GPS device into a car to know about a GPS.  In addition, you don’t need to know about cars to install a GPS device (most of them anyway), seeing they run on batteries, and you can plug them into the cigarette lighter.  Neither of those situations require knowledge specific to cars, just like installing a desktop environment requires no knowledge specific to the OS.</p>
<p>As for installing a desktop enviornment, most distros install at least one by default, and all you have to do is go through the installation wizard.  Even if a specific distro didn’t you could find a tutorial on how to do it, and they’re detailed enough so you don’t need any Linux specific knowledge (you just need to know how to type, and follow directions).</p>
<p>Anyway, we can continue arguing semantics, but the bottom line is that RSCShadow doesn’t know shit about desktop environments, and there is no objective reason to display disgust towards KDE.</p>

Your GPS analogy is hardly like this situation.</p>

<p>“just like installing a desktop environment requires no knowledge specific to the OS.”<br>
Wrong, you need to know a couple of things like:<br>
CentOS:<br>
yum -y install vnc-server<br>
yum -y groupinstall ‘KDE (K Desktop Environment)’<br>
…I could go on, but I know you get the point.</p>

<p>Because you can’t compare a 2 step process (GPS) and like a 5 - 6 step process (installing KDE - Not to mention if you want to encrypt through SSH tunnel).</p>

<li>
<p>Dude, the whole point in my argument is you have to know some knowledge about linux. Saying “follow directions” makes my whole argument when I said “you need to know some linux commands” when YOU said you didn’t need to. It’s sad because you still don’t get it.</p>

<li>
<p>A desktop environment is not a process (not the kind you’re talking about anyway), nor is a GPS…  Also, how the fuck are you encrypting a desktop environment through SSH?  That makes absolutely no sense, and is outright retarded.  I don’t think you realize that a desktop environment is simply a GUI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typing things that are explicitly given to you requires no Linux specific knowledge…  All it requires is the ability to type something exactly as you see it…  So, you don’t need to know any ‘Linux commands’ to install a desktop environment.  Also, most distros (for desktop usage) come with one…  And what’s sad is that <span class="bbcode-b">you</span> don’t get it; just like you don’t get it in any of the other threads you argue with me in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, you’re an idiot seeing you can’t comprehend that following instructions, that tell you exactly what to type, requires no OS specific knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Installing a desktop environment doesn’t have anything to do with the words desktop environment and Linux being used interchangeably, or being able to objectively justify a feeling of disgust towards KDE.<br>

</li>
<li>
<p>You completely missed the point. We’re talking about steps to instal. Also encrypted SSH tunneling has more to do with a vnc viewer. You’re trying too hard to get out of this hole you’re in dude, calm down and stop raging.</p>

<p>Respond again if you want (which we all know you will, just to give yourself the false satisfaction that you’ve won), it wont make a difference - You’re clearly in a hole and desperately searching for a way out. This is the last time I’m responding to you.<br>

<li>
<p>No, you brought up a completely irrelevant point, and are making the most retarded claims possible.  Now, what the fuck does vnc software have to do with anything in this entire thread?  Oh wait, NOTHING.  Hole, what the hell are you talking about?  You’ve done nothing in this thread but show your stupidity, and inability to use logic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nice excuse for not having to respond to a solid point, that you have absolutely no way of refuting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refer to <span class="hashtag">#2</span>.</p>

<li>
<p>Did you completely forget how this entire fork in the discussion started, or are you too retarded coming up with stupid shit that is completely irrelevant to even consider it?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>False satisfaction that I won?  Anyone that can use simple reasoning can see you’ve in no way even come close to winning, and that everything you’ve said in this thread is completely, and utterly retarded; as usual.  As usual, you run from the argument because you’re getting completely owned, in every way imaginable.  When will you learn that you can’t win when you’re completely wrong from the beginning?[/quote]</p>

<p>Because you can’t compare a 2 step process (GPS) and like a 5 - 6 step process (installing KDE - Not to mention if you want to encrypt through SSH tunnel).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dude, the whole point in my argument is you have to know some knowledge about linux. Saying “follow directions” makes my whole argument when I said “you need to know some linux commands” when YOU said you didn’t need to. It’s sad because you still don’t get it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think you’re getting my point now. Insulting me makes that clear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better question; How is it NOT relevant?</p>

<li>
<p>A desktop environment is not a process (not the kind you’re talking about anyway), nor is a GPS…  Also, how the fuck are you encrypting a desktop environment through SSH?  That makes absolutely no sense, and is outright retarded.  I don’t think you realize that a desktop environment is simply a GUI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typing things that are explicitly given to you requires no Linux specific knowledge…  All it requires is the ability to type something exactly as you see it…  So, you don’t need to know any ‘Linux commands’ to install a desktop environment.  Also, most distros (for desktop usage) come with one…  And what’s sad is that <span class="bbcode-b">you</span> don’t get it; just like you don’t get it in any of the other threads you argue with me in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, you’re an idiot seeing you can’t comprehend that following instructions, that tell you exactly what to type, requires no OS specific knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Installing a desktop environment doesn’t have anything to do with the words desktop environment and Linux being used interchangeably, or being able to objectively justify a feeling of disgust towards KDE.</p>

<p>You completely missed the point. We’re talking about steps to instal. Also encrypted SSH tunneling has more to do with a vnc viewer. You’re trying too hard to get out of this hole you’re in dude, calm down and stop raging.</p>

<p>Respond again if you want (which we all know you will, just to give yourself the false satisfaction that you’ve won), it wont make a difference - You’re clearly in a hole and desperately searching for a way out. This is the last time I’m responding to you.<br>

<li>
<p>No, you brought up a completely irrelevant point, and are making the most retarded claims possible.  Now, what the fuck does vnc software have to do with anything in this entire thread?  Oh wait, NOTHING.  Hole, what the hell are you talking about?  You’ve done nothing in this thread but show your stupidity, and inability to use logic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nice excuse for not having to respond to a solid point, that you have absolutely no way of refuting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refer to <span class="hashtag">#2</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did you completely forget how this entire fork in the discussion started, or are you too retarded coming up with stupid shit that is completely irrelevant to even consider it?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>False satisfaction that I won?  Anyone that can use simple reasoning can see you’ve in no way even come close to winning, and that everything you’ve said in this thread is completely, and utterly retarded; as usual.  As usual, you run from the argument because you’re getting completely owned, in every way imaginable.  When will you learn that you can’t win when you’re completely wrong from the beginning?<br>
