<p>No, not at all.  Desktop environments do not fall under Linux knowledge, they’re completely separate.  What you said would be the same as, “You’re talking about GPS, so I assumed you were talking about GPS devices that go in cars.  That would fall under car knowledge (not knowledge of GPS itself).”</p>
<p>Now, let me explain how it’s the same, seeing you’re a fucking retard.</p>
<p>You don’t need a GPS device in your car; just like you don’t need a desktop environment.<br>
Knowledge about GPS does not fall under knowledge of cars; just like knowledge of desktop environments does not fall under knowledge of Linux.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many different things a GPS can be used with, and the same goes with OSes and desktop environments.  You’re making an assumption which attempts to link two things.  Then, you’re saying knowledge about the things you linked falls under the category of what you linked it to; not the actual category it falls under.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>For one, that has nothing to do with it at all, and is completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>But, to humor you, I’ll go back to the GPS analogy, you don’t need to know how to install a GPS device into a car to know about a GPS.  In addition, you don’t need to know about cars to install a GPS device (most of them anyway), seeing they run on batteries, and you can plug them into the cigarette lighter.  Neither of those situations require knowledge specific to cars, just like installing a desktop environment requires no knowledge specific to the OS.</p>
<p>As for installing a desktop enviornment, most distros install at least one by default, and all you have to do is go through the installation wizard.  Even if a specific distro didn’t you could find a tutorial on how to do it, and they’re detailed enough so you don’t need any Linux specific knowledge (you just need to know how to type, and follow directions).</p>
<p>Anyway, we can continue arguing semantics, but the bottom line is that RSCShadow doesn’t know shit about desktop environments, and there is no objective reason to display disgust towards KDE.</p>

              <p>I’m confused…this thread can be seen in one of two ways…</p>
<p>A) CodeForFame has lost his patience with the amount of stupidity he claims to see on these forums and has taken on the job of setting everyone in their place.</p>
<p>OR…</p>
<p>B) He’s being trolled hardcore in an attempt to shut him up, but instead continues to fuel his own anger by responding to every post that he takes on.</p>
<p>Dial 1-888-401-9001 if you choose A,<br>
Dial 1-888-401-9002 if you choose B,</p>
<p>Phone lines are now open, people of Moparscape, YOU decide who moves on as the clear winner of this thread.</p>
