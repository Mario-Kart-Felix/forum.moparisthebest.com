    <title>Quick And Short - Hells-History</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quick-and-short-hells-history/427978</link>
    <description>Hello, as my title states it all.. &#39;Quick And Short&#39;
Basically I have got a new computer, and fixed all the errors that came whilst hosting a server with vista to windows7, I know... it doesn&#39;t seem like a big error or hard work to add Programfiles (x86) inside my compiler but it was a lot more than that... the server will be 24/7 online and possibly lots of players as my BETA test was successful when I ran / hosted my server on vista. I need good java coders to fix a few bugs for the custom pvp that my x-coder help make, and a few client bugs that could take you about 5 min&#39;s to fix. If you are intrested &#39;PLEASE&quot; comment and let me know.
