    <title>Help with bug</title>

    <description>Okay, I have a great server based with devolution v7. I completely customized the whole thing and there appears to be a bug with trading. If you click on an item, and then right click on it before it goes into the trade window, there will be an option box up although the item is no longer in the inventory. Click offer 1, and it duplicates the item. You can only do this if you start out with 2 of the same item, you can get 3.

If anyone can fix this in devolution source, I&#39;ll give you mod on my server. I&#39;m not saying you want mod, I&#39;m just offering it.

If anyone can, I&#39;ll give you full credit on my site and server for fixing the biggest bug in the game.
