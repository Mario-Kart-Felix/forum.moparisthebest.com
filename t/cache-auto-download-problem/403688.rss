    <title>Cache Auto download problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cache-auto-download-problem/403688</link>
    <description> :( :(

So everyone but me is having problems with my client.
In CacheDownloader.java i have put this as direct download to my cache


http://download171.mediafire.com/ucsee4s2zkbg/b434a3osn7s7e3g/cache.zip

It works downloading the cache for me. But for everyone else they get error messages that say they cant find &quot;C:/Erasedpkzcache1/Maps/mapConfig.txt&quot; my client finds it but not theirs. It tries to download the cache for like 2 seconds but then it says error please report and that message about the mapconfig.txt comes up in the debug. I think the issue is that it tries to find mapConfig.txt before the cache is downloaded, but why for everyone else and not me? My cachedownloader.java: http://morot4.webs.com/Webclient/CacheDownloader.java
webclient:
http://morot4.webs.com/Webclient/webclient.html

whats wrong with my client?
