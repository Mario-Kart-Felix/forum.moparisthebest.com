    <title>Dual monitor color calibration profiles?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dual-monitor-color-calibration-profiles/413587</link>
    <description>I just got a new second monitor but the color on it is tinted slightly blue, and im not sure why. My main display draws colors perfectly but anytime I throw in a second one its always off a bit. Obviously I need to be able to see colors since im an artist, does anyone know how I can get them running the same colors?

Both at 1600x900
One is HD but im pretty sure that only applies to movies connected via DVI
One is samsung and one is hp connected via hdmi

Im on an ATI 6570</description>

<p>The only thing I can suggest is try going to a friend/relatives house with the monitor, and see if it happens when plugged into their machine. If it does, then that indicates a problem with the monitor, and you can probably get a replacement from the manufacturer. If it works fine on their computers, then that might indicate a problem with either the video cable, or perhaps a problem with the graphics card itself.</p>
<p>There were two instances in which something similar happened to me. The first incident was with an ATI Radeon HD4890. It had a blue tint to it. I tried everything I could think of, and finally ended up plugging the card into my cousins machine, and his monitor had a blue tint. I sent it back to newegg, they sent me a replacement.</p>
<p>The second incident was with my current card; A Zotac GeForce GTX 460. It had more of a red tint, and I went through the same procedure as the ATI card, but it worked fine on my cousins machine. Turns out I had installed the drivers that came with the card, only to find out they hadn’t been updated since 2009. So I updated it with the official drivers, and the tint was gone.</p>

              <p>yea you can change the colors via CCC (catalyst control center) and sometimes even on the actual monitor which would be better but as I said not always possible</p>
