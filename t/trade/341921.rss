    <description>Hey guys, my 517 disabled trading, I fxed it so that u can actually go to the trade screen, and all of that works, it&#39;s just that on the first page I can&#39;t offer anything, and it&#39;s not just me, I did it with other players (2  clients 1 comp) and I canny offer anything. If u want to see any file, I will post the entire code in it. I am currently at a frends house for a sleep over, and will post the info tomorrow.</description>
