    <description>Look, i coded this to let people not connect with the owner&#39;s name and it doesn&#39;t work... what have i done wrong? thanks.

&lt;blockquote&gt;if(playerName.contains(&quot;*******&quot;) &amp;&amp; !connectedFrom.equals(&quot;**.**.**.**.*&quot;)){
println(&quot;Not from localhost!&quot;);
returnCode = 9;
disconnected = true;
savefile = false;
return;
}&lt;/blockquote&gt;i need to code the right code that people cannot connect with the name ********/ when you put a / after the name you can always login to the account. in this case the owner&#39;s acc. this doesnt work:
&lt;blockquote&gt;if(playerName.contains(&quot;\&quot;)){
returnCode = 20;
disconnected = true;
return;
}&lt;/blockquote&gt;because \ is a anti-code , when you need to explain something you give, for example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;if(playerName.contains(&quot;\&quot;)){ // this means people cannot connect when a name contains \
returnCode = 20;
disconnected = true;
return;
}&lt;/blockquote&gt;need a bit help on this. thanks.</description>
