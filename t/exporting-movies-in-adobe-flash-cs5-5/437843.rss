    <title>Exporting movies in Adobe Flash CS5.5</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/exporting-movies-in-adobe-flash-cs5-5/437843</link>
    <description>I have Flash CS5.5 and I tried to export my movie. It ended up exporting in the AVI file format, except it was 1.1GB. I tried reducing my settings and even removed the sound, it still came up 1.1GB. I tried to export it using different options, but its really not working, the file size is just getting bigger. How can I export it properly and have my 3 minute video be like 50MB instead of 1000MB+?
Thanks.</description>

<p>try a different file format. Avi files does come out rendered large<br>
render in .wmv (windows media video) it usually comes out in the 50mbs like you want<br>

<p>I changed the quality from great to shit and now its 100MB. So it all worked out. A mod can close this.[/quote]<br>
compressing from avi to wmv can save you even more room.<br>
you can keep the same great quality at 100mb (I believe) try it</p>
