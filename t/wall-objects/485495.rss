    <description>I&#39;m looking for some good object IDs for walls that actually work. I have created a custom map using the RS2 map editor but there is no way to add walls. I&#39;ve looked through the ID lists and cannot seem to find a good normal looking wall. Any ideas?</description>

<p>Okay first of all I’m not “starting off” on moparscape. I’m not new here. Second of all, he was the one who came off rude first, if you haven’t seen in his first post. Don’t bother replying to this and stop spamming my topic.</p>

<p>OMFG. If you haven’t realized I DID change the object type. I said the walls are invisible and not working. None of the IDs work. If your next post isn’t helpful, DON’T BOTHER POSTING. THANK YOU.</p>
