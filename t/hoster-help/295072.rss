    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hoster-help/295072</link>
    <description>Hey I have a server which is currently running from hamachi. Which as every one knows, is very annoying and time wasting. I would make it non-hamachi but my router can&#39;t port forward. Its a GT724-WG. Its not listed on portforward.com so I have no idea how to get port forwarding up and running. Yes im pretty sure that there is a way to get it working but im no good with any of that kinda stuff  :confused:  only good with coding servers. (Not to brag). Anyways, if someone would like to host for my server, obviously they would be admin/co-owner in game, then please reply or contact me on the forums ~ * Link removed. 

Need to be able to port forward the server, and have at lease basic knowledge of coding. Theres a few vids on youtube on the server, just search failscape private server. Server info-317, lots of customs, D claws, D plate, all that good stuff Xd.

Also im not sure if this is against the rules  :eek:  so if it is sorry i wasnt aware. Kinda new to MoparScape.</description>
