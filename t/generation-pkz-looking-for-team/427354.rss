    <title>Generation-Pkz (LOOKING FOR TEAM)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/generation-pkz-looking-for-team/427354</link>
    <description>Hello, my name is Anthony. Im currently looking for a decent staff team so i can start running my server and everything is smooth. Im currently looking for 2 coders. Not any bad coders. What i mean by coder&#39;s, this is what they should be able to code:

- objects adding
- commands
- client coding
- interfaces (client sided)
- And basically most of the basic things.

This also includes understanding the codes.

The Server?:

The server is a spawn-server named Generation-Pkz by me. I also need Moderator&#39;s And Administrator&#39;s, but thats coming later. The coder&#39;s will receive admin ingame, but if the coder can add a developer icon (client sided) that would be very much appreciated. The coder&#39;s will also get money if they stay with me, i can only pay you once i get donations since im with 0 atm. But ill be accepting rsgp donations so we can share that.

Some pictures:
