    <title>Anyone got their permit? Takin the test on thursday</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-got-their-permit-takin-the-test-on-thursday/16986</link>
    <description>Hey, well, I&#39;m turning 14 this thursday, and I&#39;ve sorta been studying, but I was just wondering about everyone elses experiences with the test. I know it may vary between states, but the content must be somewhat similar. I&#39;m guessing the test will be mainly bases on road signs, right of way, rules of the road, some other things like parking.

If I&#39;m way off here, or you have some tips, I&#39;d appreciate the input. :)

-Weibs.

EDIT: I gotta go to bed now, I&#39;ll check this in the morning and then after school.</description>

<p>Most of the questions are about that hard. Just think about it. And remember to pick the <span class="bbcode-b">maximum</span> penalty on any question about fines or jail time.[/quote]And maximum distance for such questions as how far away you should shart indicating from, how far away you should start braking from, etc…Besides those questions, which are obvious if you think about what they want you to answer, the permit test isn’t bad at all.</p>

<p>-.-, no. If you would like to know, I took Geometry and got A’s in it, so I know what an octogon is. It was one of those detailed questions that asked for specific time-spans and/or distances for stuff.</p>

              <p>Don’t stress about it and you won’t have a problem. I didn’t study at all, and I passed on my second test (first one was failed by ONE question &gt;.&lt;).  When I say didn’t study, I mean it. I didn’t open the DMV book…ever. But you should remember the details of stuff; I remember one of the questions being “How many feet away from a fire hydrant can you park?” and stuff like that. Most is common sense, but be sure to remember to details if you wanna be sure of passing.</p>

<p>Most of the questions are about that hard. Just think about it. And remember to pick the <span class="bbcode-b">maximum</span> penalty on any question about fines or jail time.</p>

              <p>Don’t worry mate, you will pass it. It isn’t that hard. You should be glad that your not in England, you have to drive a stick-shift car, and take a written test.</p>
<p>If your not confident enough right now, then use google to search for free online driving tests.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

              <p>Hey, well, I’m turning 14 this thursday, and I’ve sorta been studying, but I was just wondering about everyone elses experiences with the test. I know it may vary between states, but the content must be somewhat similar. I’m guessing the test will be mainly bases on road signs, right of way, rules of the road, some other things like parking.</p>
<p>If I’m way off here, or you have some tips, I’d appreciate the input. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>EDIT: I gotta go to bed now, I’ll check this in the morning and then after school.</p>
