        <p>Hello everyone,<br>
I’m here because of no particular reason. I’m fairly new to the RuneScape Private Server scene and I’ve been interested in working with it. I have very little programming experience, but I relatively know how they work. I have messed around with Java just a little, but I’m probably not going to be able to code my own everything like some of you probably can.</p>
<p>As I’m sure this post will piss someone off because I’m acting like I want everyone to spoon-feed me these answers, but I’ve been looking for hours and haven’t found a decent server that I can modify without wanting to redo the entire thing.</p>
<p>I am more-or-less asking for a few tips for new wanna-be server owners, for someone that wishes to learn The Ways of the Brokedness of the Private Servers. I found them quite intriguing especially learning how flexible people have made their own.</p>
<p>Right, I’m looking for some sort of base that is fairly-newb-friendly and is quite plain. I don’t want this entire pre-made thing laying at my feet waiting for me to squish it, I need something with… a couple of “examples” or whatever of how I may do this, because I have absolutely no idea how to have a decent customized server running after researching the majority of my day (8 or so hours).</p>
<p>Anyways, please leave any tips you may have for me or recommend me something to use (please don’t do 317 … I’d rather something around the 5XX - 6XX revisions (suggestions only)). I’m pretty bad at learning this, even the thousands of guides on this isn’t helping me, since they’re all about how to port forward! I want to be able to make a real server that is different from the rest, or at least something so I can say I’m not being cheap and copying everything in the damn world.</p>
<p>Well, thanks.</p>
