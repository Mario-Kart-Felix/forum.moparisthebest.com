    <title>itemOperate.java; Changing the item in question</title>

    <description>Ohai.
Basically, I have a problem. Recently, I started a little 508 project, using a Bulby base.
Among other things, I&#39;ve made the Bowsword to fire like a bow, and I&#39;ve made a melee variant of the Bowsword (using the same model) to slash like a 2h.
This all works fine, but I had intended to allow the player to operate the Ranged Bowsword to turn it into the Melee Bowsword (and vice versa).

However, I know bugger all about 508s, they honestly confuse the hell out of me and I&#39;m surprised I managed to get this far with it. Anyway, my problem is that the Bowsword case in itemOperate.java which I have added will not compile. It tells me it cannot find the symbols for addItem and removeItem, and I don&#39;t know of an alternative. Here is my code.

[code]
case 6818: //Range bowsword
if (itemId == 6818);
Engine.playerItems.removeItem(p.equipment[3]);
Engine.playerItems.addItem(p.equipment[3], 6912);
p.appearanceUpdateReq = true;
p.updateReq = true;
break;
[/code]

6818 = Ranged Bowsword
6912 = Melee Bowsword

All I want it to do is replace the Ranged Bowsword (which will be in the weapon slot, or p.equipment[3]) with the Melee variant.
I did not think this would be too much to ask, but clearly it isn&#39;t as simple as I was expecting.
Any input would be appreciated, so fire away! :)</description>

              <p>Well, I hang my head in shame for missing that one, turns out I’d declared the wrong variables, mine were for adding items to the inventory…</p>
<p>I’m still stuck with 1 compile error, apparently I can’t apply the addItem to (Bulby.players.Player,int,int,int). Now I won’t lie, I don’t have a damn clue what the hell I can do about that one. Help? :L</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Ugh, the compiler is really ticking me off. The only way it’ll shut up is when I remove the line entirely, but it’s essential to make it function properly…<br>
I need an alternative, badly. The compiler error is as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">.\Bulby\io\packets\ItemOperate.java:76: addItem(Bulby.players.Player,int,int) in
 Bulby.players.items.PlayerItems cannot be applied to (Bulby.players.Player,int,
int,int)
Engine.playerItems.addItem(p, 6912, p.equipment[3], 1);
                  ^</code></pre>
<p>and the line in question is</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Engine.playerItems.addItem(p, 6912, p.equipment[3], 1);</code></pre>
