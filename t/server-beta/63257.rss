    <description>Hey Im working on my server again. I started sometime in December, but I never got around to finishing it because after a while I just gave up. 

Now Im trying to edit and change some stuff. I need some coders, to help me with some things. The coders get admin/mode status, depending on how much they helped. 

I won&#39;t give out the name and no its not (Ownerz R Us, anymore) I changed it, since that would be advertising.

Lets start. (If you want to get on the server and talk on there so its a littel eaiser and see how everything is, pm me and ill give you the server info. **Yeah this server was edited by me and help from a friend, which I have no longer contact too**)
==========================================

Currently:

What Im trying to do is, make a place. (I already have varrock castle half into a safe zone) but I was thinking I can move the markets to a different place rather then varrock, and keep that for fighting. Right now I just need help either making varrock castle a safe zone, fully around the whole place. OR try and find a different better looking town to keep as markets. 

Then I can move all the NPC&#39;s over there, along with the spwn point of where you die, and start out the game from.</description>
