    <title>PI player vs player</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-player-vs-player/453007</link>
    <description>Sometimes when a player fights another player everything is going normal. They do damage to eachother and one player wins.
But sometimes one player will not take any damage.
But that player receiving no damage will damage the other player they fight.
I dont know what causes this but it does it randomly.
It would make the opponent invincible and the other player will not be able to kill him.
I really need help to fix this.
I went over the files and couldnt find the problem.
I really need some help.</description>
