    <description>I have a desktop computer... (dell). and when i turn it on, it starts up and then i go to log on my account and it tells me i have malware that should be taken care of using my software... but by the time the computer finishes loading to where i can click something (like anti-virus scan thing) it restarts. When i log in with safe mode the scanner i have is rarely used so i need to connect  to the internet to verify my account, and in safe mode my internet doesn&#39;t work. So um... any ideas of how to fix the shit?</description>
