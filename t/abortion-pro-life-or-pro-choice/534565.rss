    <title>Abortion: pro life or Pro choice?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/abortion-pro-life-or-pro-choice/534565</link>
    <description>Abortion has long been a controversial topic. Many Americans feel strongly about this subject because it involves such important issues as life and death, one&#39;s religious beliefs, the health of women and who controls women&#39;s bodies.

Should Women have the right to have an abortion?

Why do you choose pro choice or pro life?

side notes:
pro choice = for abortion
pro life = against abortion</description>

              <p>it is a womans right to choose. is it selfish to abort a child because of your unchecked promiscuous habits? debatable. but there are plenty of cases where abortion is used in scenarios of rape and incest, you can’t blanket not giving women a choice because of the previous case. even beside that point, how is it your right to say that a woman must carry a child she does not feel the need for? society needs to steer clear of being emotionally involved in situations like that.</p>

              <p>Honestly I think a lot of people hear it like this:  <span class="bbcode-b">womans right</span> [sup]to choose[/sup]</p>
<p>and thats why to some people it becomes an issue about ‘feelings’ and women being able to make the choice and feminist stuff in general… when like jc said its about when a fetus becomes a life form, and the future of the baby after it’s born. making bad choices and then feeling entitled to take the easy way out ‘because its your body’ for yourself is wrong. like I said earlier I think a major issue with it is our foster care and orphan systems, and not being able to guarantee a child a decent life if they are born into an unsupportive family that made bad choices.</p>

              <p>yea, people always seem to think abortion is about women… unless I was taught something incorrectly I recall it takes a man and a woman and a stork to make a baby, you can’t just say this is a woman rights issue (exception being rape where you don’t know who the father is)</p>
<p>that said, I believe if you limit abortion to rape-only cases you’re going to cause a lot more females to start falsely crying rape, which is already a big issue (hurr durr females arent perfect), and the abortion issue is always a lose-lose situation for everyone, no matter which way the law goes</p>

She has a point though. It’s pretty odd to see a room full of grey haired old men discussing what’s best for young women.<br>

It’s completely circumstantial.</p>
<p>Unsafe sex as a teen, etc = keep tha baby, it’s your problem now</p>
<p>Rape = give tha woman a choice</p>
<p>Other circumstances = evaluation based on said circumstance<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>And who is to evaluate the circumstance? How do we know these people are qualified to judge someone elses life and its outcome? We shouldn’t make abortion illegal because it restricts our rights as a human, not males of course but womens. Men wouldn’t like being told “no” when trying to get rid of something they didn’t want, so why is it acceptable to reject woman pleas for this.</p>
<p>If roles were reversed and men were the ones having babies, without a doubt they’d be given the ability no questions asked. Why? Because they’re men and what they want they get (with the acception of gay men because they’re socially unaccepted for some reason). You can complain about women’s liberation all you want and the equality of genders but this right here is the decision of the person not the community. This isn’t about effecting the lives of many other people not just the one fetus that isn’t going to survive.[/quote]</p>
<p>It seems like your focus here is more-so the fact that men are treated differently than women. I’d just like to point out that I am in no way complaining about women’s liberation, nor have I in the past or will ever in the future, so I’m not sure why that was directed at me. When I think about the abortion debate, gender never crosses my mind and even if men were able to reproduce, I wouldn’t change my views on abortion.</p>
<p>PS: Don’t bring “feelings” into this debate.</p>
<p>PSS: I am very pro women’s rights, just to let you know.</p>
