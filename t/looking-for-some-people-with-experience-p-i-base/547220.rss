    <title>Looking for some people with experience [P.I Base]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-some-people-with-experience-p-i-base/547220</link>
    <description>Hello guy&#39;s, I am looking for a coder and a client developer for my server who will help me and back me up on coding the current server I am hosting.
I have done a lot of work on the server ATM, but there is so much more to do!

I will need someone who has a good amount of experience at coding/client developing.

For proof of my server or general talk contact me here, or at my Skype - Neevbc.

There is a lot of work to do, but it shouldn&#39;t be too hard!
My server has got a VPS.
Been hosted for 4-5 days now, got 5-10 players online most of the time, and will invest in advertising once I fix some stuff up.

I have made up this post cause I am entering a time that I won&#39;t have a lot of time to code like I use to.</description>

Can I check out your server? No guarantees on help, but being able to see your server would help me decide…<br>

Sure I guess, how do you want me to contact ya?[/quote]<br>
Doesn’t matter imo. Skype is on my profile, so is pm’ing, and etc. so.</p>
