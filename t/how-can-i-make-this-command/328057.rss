              <p>[quote=“The Chubby Bunny, post:2, topic:328057”]first of all, add this to the top of your client.java, outside the start of the class (you should see other’s like it).</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">import java.util.Math; // imports a whole nother class from the java class library</code></pre>
<p>Now declare an array with the sum of all the different platebodies you want<br>

<pre><code class="lang-auto">int[] pBodies = new int[7]  // Declares an array of integers that holds 7 different integers

pBodies[1] = ####;  // In this case the #### would be the platebodies' item ID
pBodies[2] = ####;  // etc.
pBodies[3] = ####;
pBodies[4] = ####;
pBodies[5] = ####;
pBodies[6] = ####;
pBodies[7] = ####;</code></pre>
<p>Now, your command should have something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Random math = new Random(); //  Creates a new instance of the class random, look into this on google, it's very useful
for (int i=1; i&lt;7; i++) {  // for loop which loops the number, and ending at another, in this case it would be like writing "pBodies[1]" like we did above, but this time it we're not setting it to a specific number
int rPBody = math.nextInt(pBodies.length);
int temp = pBodies[i];
pBodies[i] = pBodies[rPBody];
pbodies[randomPosition] = temp;</code></pre>
<p>You should really learn how to use for loops (the for(int i=1;i&lt;7; i++)), you’ll use this in 100% of the shit you write, and are extremely useful. There are tons of guides and explanation for them, just use google.</p>
<p>this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Random math = new Random();</code></pre>
<p>Is simply explained<br>
the first part</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Random</code></pre>
<p>should be the name of the class that you are using from the java library. You actually might be able to name it anything, but im not sure. Fucking look it up, damn.<br>
the next thing</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">math</code></pre>
<p>can be anything you want, when you use a method from the class Random, you would use it as</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">math.whateverthemethodis();</code></pre>
<p>which identifies that you are using a method from another class, and which class you are getting if from.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">new Random();</code></pre>
<p>creates a new instance of the class. Which basically means you can now use any method from that class, as long as you do the step above.</p>
<p>use this <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/index.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/index.html</a> for an index of every java package created.</p>
<p>Now I would recommend copying an pasting that into your command, because you will likely get an error, because I’ve never actually done what you’re trying to do, but I’m giving you some basic knowledge on what you’re actually going to have to do to make the command work.[/quote]</p>
<p>I already have all the random armor things set up, when you type ::ranarmor it gives you 1 of each type of item</p>
<p>(e.G"necklaces, plate bodies, boots")</p>
<p>I just want those items to go into the inventory slot that it’s supposed to go to</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>It gives you 1 item of each type of armor when you type it (randomly) out of the list of items I supplied it with.</p>
