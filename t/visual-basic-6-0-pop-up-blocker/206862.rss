    <title>[Visual Basic 6.0] Pop-Up Blocker</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/visual-basic-6-0-pop-up-blocker/206862</link>
    <description>I am making a pop-up blocker that will close any window with a certain string in it.
I am having problems with determining if a string is in the title.
I am thinking I might need to use the RegEx control...?
Here is my code:
[code]Option Explicit

Private Declare Function FindWindow Lib &quot;user32&quot; _
Alias &quot;FindWindowA&quot; (ByVal szClass$, ByVal szTitle$) As Long

Private Declare Function PostMessage Lib &quot;user32&quot; _
Alias &quot;PostMessageA&quot; (ByVal hWnd As Long, ByVal wMsg As Long, ByVal wParam As Long, lParam As Any) As Long

    Private Const WM_SYSCOMMAND As Long = &amp;H112
    Private Const WM_CLOSE As Long = &amp;H10

Private Sub AdBlocker_Timer()
Dim hWnd, retval As Long
Dim WinTitle As String
WinTitle = &quot;Calculator&quot;
hWnd = FindWindow(vbNullString, WinTitle)
retval = PostMessage(hWnd, WM_CLOSE, 0&amp;, 0&amp;)
End Sub

[/code]

For example, if there was a program named &quot;CalculatorPlus&quot;, the program would search the title of that and find &quot;Calculator&quot;, and close it.
Any suggestions?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: May 20, 2008, 02:54:13 PM[/size][hr]Please reply. I need this done as fast as possible.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: May 22, 2008, 02:09:05 PM[/size][hr]Help please. Quickly.</description>
