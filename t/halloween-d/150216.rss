    <title>Halloween =D</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/halloween-d/150216</link>
    <description>ok here we go!is anyone excited about halloween? yes or no.
but anyways. i am posting this thread because i want to warn you about something that grew tremendously in the U.S (united States), you know the candy apples and the other eatable halloween treats, well
there is a problem with some of that, people like to see other people get hurt, so they injected some kind of drug i will get the name for you soon as possible, but they also insert objects in there, for example, razor blades, :( knives, :( minature knives of course...
but that&#39;s not the point
i know everyone on here isn&#39;t stupid enough to bite into a razor blade or a knife lol.
but for the under aged kids, 
well.
if you&#39;re on this you&#39;re tremendously smart, just watch out on halloween, take caution when eating you&#39;re sweets + goods, and don&#39;t be in a hurry to eat away, because eating it slow and checking it is better than not eating it at all (cuts on the mouth etc.)
+well that&#39;s what im here to tell you, feel free to post comments, and reply to me please.
i like questions, questions! questions! questions! =D, HAPPY HALLOWEEN!!!</description>
