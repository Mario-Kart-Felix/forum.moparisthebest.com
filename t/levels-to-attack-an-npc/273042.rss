    <title>Levels to attack an NPC?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/levels-to-attack-an-npc/273042</link>
    <description>Hi

I was just wondering if anyone knows/has the code that makes it so you have to be a certain level to attack an NPC.
If anybody can help at all it would be appriciated greatly..

Thx in advance
