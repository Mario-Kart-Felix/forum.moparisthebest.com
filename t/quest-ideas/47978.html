        <p>use your creativity lol.<br>
Anyways, here’s an idea:</p>
<p>Quest title: Troubled magician (or something like this lol)<br>
Start at: wizard tower leader(or who is he lol)</p>
<p>He tells you:<br>
-“Hello. I need some help, can you?”<br>
You respond yes<br>
-“I write letters to my friend, “Name here” every week, and he always replys back. But last week, he didnt reply. Can you check on him, if everything’s alright? He lives in (for example travelry) in a house. You can recognise it by there’s (insert thing for recognising)… blah blah. I’m sure you wouldn’t have any problems finding it. Good luck!”</p>
<p>Okay, he maybe gives you a letter, or something, and you say thanks, and start.<br>
when you reach the guy’s house, you notice it’s locked. You need to get a needle to pick it, or a picklock. or something like that. Okay, you get it, but it doesn’t work, and you notice something behind a decoration in front of the house. for example potted flower, and you use it, then you get in. (or something like this) then you start searching for it, and when you use something, like a crate, like you pull it, then notice a ladder behind/below it. So you go down. (Or is this wrong? because there might not be a perfect existing place for this…) So when you’re down, you’re in a cave, and you see a collapsed hall. You need a pickaxe to go through, and when you do so, an enemy, like a skeleton attacks you.(If its possible lol) You go foward and end up in a bigger place. You see the guy who you need to find, but you need to kill a high lvl monster first. when you killed it, the guy tells you:</p>
<p>“Thank you, adventurer. what is your name?”<br>
You say your name.<br>
“Thank you, “name” for rescueing me. How did you get here?”<br>
You say who sent you to find him<br>
“Oh, that guy you say, i wanted to write him, that i discovered a secret lair in my house, and i want to go down, but i couldnt wait, and ive went here. And suddenly a this monster came, and he wanted to eat me!(or something lol)”<br>
okay, you talk some more, maybe some stuff why did the monster came, etc. finnaly he tells you he will only leave, if you get an item he lost in the cave. After you get it, you 2 go up, the guy blocks the ladder forever, and says:</p>
<p>“Thanks. Please give this letter to “the wizard lol”. I worte in it what happened to me. Bye”</p>
<p>You go back to the wizard, but he’s busy, and you ask what he’s busy with.<br>
he tells you:<br>
“We’ve just had an attack from the cellar, some monsters made a cave leading to our tower’s cellar. We have to block it, because more monsters will come, and we may not be able to fight them. Have you got any ideas?”<br>
You say yes, your idea is you get some clay, and help the wizards block the path. But you need 25 pieces of soft clay, a bucket of water, a spade, and a magical item. (can be anything)</p>
<p>So you come back with the stuff, but suddenly a monster(or more) from the cave attacks you, and you have to kill it/them. After you’ve done, you get to the wizard. You give him the stuff, and you all build a big wall of clay. The wizard thanks you, and asks if you know anything about these monsters. You tell him, that the same happened to his friend in travelry. He says omg is he alright? You say, yes, ive saved him. and you give the wizard the letter the guy wrote, or if theres no letter, then not. lol He thanks you again, and starts to wonder. Where did these creatures come from? why would they attack people?</p>
<p>And this should lead to new quests, or just continue the quest that they found out who are these creatures and where they came from. etc…</p>
<p>I hope you like it lol, ive found it out as i wrote it. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile1bce.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> i maybe use it in my own server lol</p>

        <p>Thanks. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smiley1bce.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
I have lots of other ideas.<br>
heheheh it’s not that hard to think of one, you just have to get the basic stuff about what the quest is about, and name it, then try to figure out character names,(or ID-s :P)that suit into the story. So when you begin, and you write what you have in mind, just try to think of a continuation. And try to not forget little detail, like you get an item in the beggining, but you dont even use it lol <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smiley1bce.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
And you could always use rs quests to get inspired and some ideas.[br][size=1]Posted on: January 15, 2007, 11:32:41 AM[/size][hr]Raargh, and it still haven’t ended lol, attack of 1337 king!</p>
<p>-Troubled magician-<br>
-PART 2</p>
<p>The mage says to you, that you can go now if you want, but you should come back, and help him. Here it begins…</p>
<p>You start to think about what those creatures were. They were like (type lol) Of course! they are (monster)'s(LOL!!)</p>
<p>Suddenly, the mage says: “My god!! We have to tell varrock’s king, that whole varrock is in danger!! You know the sewers… just think if those monsters get in there, come up, and kill everyone. We HAVE TO INFORM THEM! Quickly, (playername) you have to tell the king!”</p>
<p>Then you go back to varrock, and tell the king, the king says:</p>
<p>“Thank you, adventurer. Unfortunately, there is a pipe in the sewers, what does lead into a cave. I shall call all the people in my castle to tell them to block a known pipe, that no creatures may come through. You have to help me, please. Tell the shopkeepers that they need to help too, and they should come to me.”</p>
<p>Maybe a scene here, the king talks, or gives you these orders:<br>
“Please go down, and check that pipe, if there’s no that kind of creatures in the sewers. While you’re down there, i have a talk with the people. be careful!”</p>
<p>And, after the talk, or before it, you go down the sewers, and check it. You see some of them there, you have to kill them.after you’ve done with that, you report it to the king, that the creatures already reached the sewers.</p>
<p>The king says:<br>
“Oh, then i have to send all my guards to secure the sewers. Will you help me please?”</p>
<p>You say yes, my lord(lol)</p>
<p>So then the people with stuff, and the guards, and you go down, there they put you in a spot you need to watch for the monsters. When the blockage is half-completed, you hear a strange sound from the pipe. The other guards doesnt come with you, and you go foward to the source of the sound. While you’re in, the guards have to fight some monsters, and they forget about you. when the block is almost completed, they call the guards through, so they wont close them in.(lol) But they’ve forgot you!</p>
<p>You hear the sound louder and louder. You get to a small hole in the wall(or something) you look through, and it’s a (monster queen or something lol) you say oh my god! Then you think of, hey wait, make sure if people havent forgotten about you. You go back, and BANG! they’ve closed you in!</p>
<p>But they didnt notice, you think you have to go out of there as fast as you can. You try to find a way out, but all you find is blocked ways, or monster guards. Then you see a rope, from above, and you go towards it. Some guards attack you. After you kill them, you go up, and find yourself in a little hut. The door leading out is locked, and you are aware that monsters may come up. But then… you suddenly think:</p>
<p>“hey wait, if this is a hut, and there’s a bed over there, and nobody’s here, then… I must save him!”</p>
<p>You go back, down again. You go through some hallways, and you find the person, guarded by some monsters. After you rescue him, he says:</p>
<p>“Thanks for rescuing me! I would have died without you! etc etc lol and: What could i do for you?”<br>
You say:<br>
“help me get out of here, of course. have you got the key to your main door?”<br>
He says no, he lost it.</p>
<p>After a bit of searching, you find it. You go up, and you have to fight AGAIN(lol so much fighting im crazy)<br>
After you kill blah blah blah <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smiley1bce.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> you can go out. You tell the king, that they’ve closed you in, and that those monsters HAVE TO BE ELIMINATED once, and for all.</p>
<p>The king gives you a reward, he apoligise, for they had closed you in, and thanks all your work.</p>
<p>–QUEST ENDS HERE, TO BE CONTINUED OMG LOL—<br>
Lol, shall i begin to write part 3 or, did this part go bad? (maybe because of impossible to do to us, and maybe the much fighting.)</p>
