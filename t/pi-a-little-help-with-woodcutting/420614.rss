    <title>[PI] A little help with woodcutting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-a-little-help-with-woodcutting/420614</link>
    <description>I have been working on a new woodcutting for the past few hours, but I have an issue with the time it adds the logs, its like really fast, anyway to slow it down, I won&#39;t add the whole code up their, due to the fact I don&#39;t want my work getting leeched to death, but here is some.
[code]
		public void cutWood(int Id) {
				if(checkAxe() == true) {
					if(allGood() == true) {
						for (int i = 0; i &lt; c.playerItems.length; i++) {
							c.getItems().addItem(Id, 1);
							c.getPA().addSkillXP(XpforId(Id) * Config.WOODCUTTING_EXPERIENCE, c.playerWoodcutting);
							c.turnPlayerTo(c.objectX, c.objectY);
							c.startAnimation(EMOTE);
						
						}

						
				} else {
					c.getPA().resetVariables();
					c.startAnimation(65535);
					c.sendMessage(&quot;You don&#39;t have the required level to cut this tree.&quot;);
					}
				} else {
					c.getPA().resetVariables();
					c.startAnimation(65535);
					c.sendMessage(&quot;You need an axe to cut this tree.&quot;);
					}
				}
[/code]
My cut wood method, anything that could be done to the for statement to make it go smoother? Also, I am not that good with for statments, all I know is that it runs the loop that you tell the int to go to, any help explaining?</description>

<p>I didn’t even look at the lines you posted that had the partial code in it. I used a more logical approach to be honest…there is a timer on thief (well stalls at least) that makes it so you can only thief after so many seconds after the first thief.</p>
<p>It’s the same concept or should be if you made it having to be constantly reclickable.</p>

              <p>I have been working on a new woodcutting for the past few hours, but I have an issue with the time it adds the logs, its like really fast, anyway to slow it down, I won’t add the whole code up their, due to the fact I don’t want my work getting leeched to death, but here is some.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">		public void cutWood(int Id) {
				if(checkAxe() == true) {
					if(allGood() == true) {
						for (int i = 0; i &lt; c.playerItems.length; i++) {
							c.getItems().addItem(Id, 1);
							c.getPA().addSkillXP(XpforId(Id) * Config.WOODCUTTING_EXPERIENCE, c.playerWoodcutting);
							c.turnPlayerTo(c.objectX, c.objectY);
							c.startAnimation(EMOTE);
						
						}

						
				} else {
					c.getPA().resetVariables();
					c.startAnimation(65535);
					c.sendMessage("You don't have the required level to cut this tree.");
					}
				} else {
					c.getPA().resetVariables();
					c.startAnimation(65535);
					c.sendMessage("You need an axe to cut this tree.");
					}
				}</code></pre>
<p>My cut wood method, anything that could be done to the for statement to make it go smoother? Also, I am not that good with for statments, all I know is that it runs the loop that you tell the int to go to, any help explaining?</p>
