    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/about-manually-downloadin-cache-extract-for-3-2/116086</link>
    <description>Ok, so after I launch the new moparscape, I click on run and the bot comes up and tells me access is denied and stuff and I have to manually download the cache and then extract to c:windows/mpr filre store thingy.
So I download cache and extract to the mpr file thingy,
but they it says that the files are protected and I need a password?????
I dont know the password so i couldnt extracted the files :(
Can anybody tell me the password or any way around it?
Help is greatly appreciated, thank you :)

(I hope my grammar is correct?)</description>
