    <description>http://www.naturalnews.com/022014_heavy_metals_childrens_health.html

This article is so full of hilarity I just had to share.

The comments are pretty worrying though, the amount of parents who believe their &quot;research&quot; has lead them to an informed decision not to vaccinate. Pretty sad those kids are going to get very very ill. It&#39;s not just vaccinations either, this guide is pretty much a guide to effectively killing yourself in the name of staying healthy. So, so sad.</description>

<a class="mention" href="/u/the">@The</a> article, I found it to be very ‘interesting’.  Just because some of the items I thought were common sense that they aren’t particularly good for your children (fast food, soda), some of them I agree with that they cause problems and I’d prefer not have them (fluoride in water, luckily I get my water from a well), but I don’t think they are, to quote, “more toxic than lead”.  Then there are things I 100% agree with that I would never give to a child, like anti-depressants, and ADHD drugs without multiple opinions and excerpting every other option possible.  And lastly there are things that give no other choice but to think this guy is freaking insane, like recommending everyone drink un-processed whole milk.  That might be OK if you own your own cow and know everything that goes into him and the milk, but not if you buy your milk from someplace else.  I also think he doesn’t understand the term ‘homogenized’, which basically just means they shake/spin the milk so hard that the fat splits up into particles so small they stay suspended and don’t join back together, scary right? :rolleyes:</p>
<p>Anyway, great article, I’ve never seen a single article by a single writer run the full gamut from common sense to completely bat-fuck insane in a list of 20 before! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>EDIT: To clarify, not every disorder has clearly defined boundaries of symptoms. The classification of psychological disorders is based on observations made by researchers. We as humans created these classes (ADHD, Aspergers, etc.). There isn’t a handbook given down by God saying “if you present x and y symptoms, you have z disease.”</p>

<p>I am diagnosed, fwiw. I used to say things like ADHD is just to cover up piss poor parenting, antidepressants are for weak people etc. too, so I don’t get mad when people say it. They’re just wrong as I was.</p>
<p>It’s not really about not fitting into normal society - everyone is different. But when your differences impact your life in a severely negative way, and are shown to fit a pattern that is found in many different people, is that not a disease? I assume those who would say “no” to this also don’t believe in, say, Dyslexia?</p>
