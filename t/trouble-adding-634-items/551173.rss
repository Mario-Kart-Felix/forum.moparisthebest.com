    <title>Trouble adding 634 items</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trouble-adding-634-items/551173</link>
    <description>Hi guys I&#39;m trying to add 634 items to a server I&#39;ve been working on for a few months now, I&#39;m just having a bit of trouble because nothing seems to be working.

I looked through tutorials and guides to find where to start, found this on another topic.

[QUOTE=Logic][url=http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-client/downloads/454769-data-releases-474-498-508-525-602-634-667-a.html]Data Releases[/url]

download the 634 data from the link above, then use index repacking to pack the item models in index1. replace obj.dat and obj.idx in cache using toms cache suite and replace your readValues method in ItemDef ONLY, no need to replace the whole class..
should be enough to get it working, if not let me know where you get stuck on.[/QUOTE]

So I followed both of the links but they didnt help much and client sided coding isnt my forte, but basically I got no errors but when I logged on the ground was black, the npc&#39;s were totally screwed and a lot of the item models were messed up or too zoomed in. Would it be possible to add them to a server that has 634 npcs and 508 maps? I&#39;ve looked elsewhere but I&#39;m still having trouble and a lot of the other guides pictures or links are broken.

this is the base I&#39;m using if it helps... [URL=http://tinyurl.com/l8msq8t]Click Here[/URL]</description>
