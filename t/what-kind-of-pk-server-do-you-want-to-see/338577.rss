<p>If I could actually earn enough from it so it paid for itself I would have done it a long time ago but the problem is it’s difficult to earn from a server where you get given everything. Paying $400-700 and upwards monthly just to stop idiots from DDoS’ing it is a lot of money for a RSC private server with a handful of players online.[/quote]</p>

<p>If it was a point system server sure then everybody could make those kinds of pkers n it would be gay…but i didnt describe the above with that in mind…all its meant to do is put everyone on a fair playing field and an equal chance at pking…coz i know not evenyone can afford to pk as a god mage etc…least now they could if they put the effort into training such a pker.</p>

Explain to me how a PK server can have an economy if everything is handed away in shops? A PK server is always the same thing, NPC’s drop Rune armour and pretty much everything else is given to you. I don’t really get it. Explain in detail what your perfect PK server would be so I can get a better understanding because I don’t see how economy and PK server could even be mentioned in the same sentence… Economics in purely supply and demand, if you don’t demand anything then there’s no point in supplying it.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Tell me if this would work…</p>
<p>Monsters dont drop anything…shops dont giv anything…there is no gp… everything u need to pk is already in ur bank…each page filled with what u need…page 1 all weapons…page 2 armour…page 3 pots/food…page 4 runes/arrows etc. All these items make it so you can pk at what ever lvl u like but heres the catch…for all the items ur given for free…u only have enough to pk once or twice at any lvl and every day no matter how much u have lost or gained from pking…all items in bank are reset to default value.</p>
<p>For example. u are given 2 rune sets and 2 r2hs and some runes among other things…u might die twice but that doesnt mean u cant pk any more for the day…u stil have 1 r2h left, pk at a different lvl (lvl 70 maging pb for instance). Or maybe u just died once while pking as a god mage…u still have a rune set left…so go pk at flats for a change…if u die again…not to worry u stil have a r2h left…go pk as a hybrid.</p>
<p>Supply and demand…since everyday (24 hours) everyones bank resets back to original value (2 rune sets 2 r2hs n runes for example) it will give everyone a chance to pk at wateva lvls that wanna pk at…god mages… flats…no magic flats… def nabs, hybrids wateva. But since ur only given enough to pk once or twice at any chosen lvl…ull always feel like picking up ur kill…coz if u dont and u die n loose the gear u need to pk with…u wont be pking anymore at that lvl for the rest of the day.[/quote]</p>

              <p>well if ur loosing interest with all the details with running a priv server or wateva goes with it and as u said the player counts is dropping, why not try something like stork…sure it might splilt the player base… but eventually all of the players will loose interest alltogether. Maybe with recreating stork you hold onto most of the players who play private servers, start a poll on ur website or something… explain what stork pk was and see how many are interested. Its worth a shot.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Kryptix, post:1, topic:338578”]It was the best server ever with the active player count, you could release a Stork replica and it still wouldn’t get popular because RSC is dead unfortunately.<br>
If I could actually earn enough from it so it paid for itself I would have done it a long time ago but the problem is it’s difficult to earn from a server where you get given everything. Paying $400-700 and upwards monthly just to stop idiots from DDoS’ing it is a lot of money for a RSC private server with a handful of players online.[/quote]If u did create a Stork Pk replica the people stil left who play RSC private servers are ganna want to play it. As for making enough from it to cover server rental fees, well what do ur subs do atm on rsce? reduce stat xp n increase xp gain are the main reasons.</p>
<p>So you couldnt use a sub to reduce stats coz stats are changeable in Stork but…since u can trade points in for xp/money, u could fix it so the xp gained from having a sub works out to be a x15 rate or wateva rsce subs get you. As for the money, big enough reason alone to get a sub…faster money gain means more people back in the wild pking.</p>
<p>Imagine having almost all ur pking gear/supplies you need in shops around edge, but having things like full rune 2h or drag/god staffs member stuff drop from monsters…certain monsters at all lvls dropping only a certain peice. I mean its dead simple, u wouldnt feel bad for noobs coz its hard to make money, or wondering how long its ganna take you to sell ur crap no1 wants to buy…u just kill mobs, get points, trade in for money, buy gear from shops or players n go pking.</p>
<p>Theres gota be more benefits small or big that would make everyone interested in buying a sub, theres only one question…if u fixed it so you could make enough from subs to pay for rental fees…would u actually make a Stork Pk server?</p>
