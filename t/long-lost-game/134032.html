<p>i think it might have “planet” in the name</p>
<p>there were no buttons when you played, just a joystick.</p>
<p>there were  4 or 5 characters you could choose from and 1 of them was in an orange jumpsuit.</p>
<p>its in 2nd person <em>your looking at your character from about 20 feet camera angle, and its 3D</em></p>
<p>and you pickup wax for your board as you go through the lvls.</p>
<p>and there was a helecopter you jumped out of.</p>
<p>if someone could find this game, that would be awesome. its just been so long. =D</p>
