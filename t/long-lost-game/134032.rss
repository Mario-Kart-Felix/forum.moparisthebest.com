    <description>i used to play this snowboarding arcade game at the skating rink a long time ago when i was like 12 or 13, but i forgot the name of the game and ive been using all search engines and i cant seem to find it. heres some information about it

i think it might have &quot;planet&quot; in the name

there were no buttons when you played, just a joystick.

there were  4 or 5 characters you could choose from and 1 of them was in an orange jumpsuit.

its in 2nd person *your looking at your character from about 20 feet camera angle, and its 3D*

and you pickup wax for your board as you go through the lvls. 

and there was a helecopter you jumped out of.



if someone could find this game, that would be awesome. its just been so long. =D


EDIT: FOUND. SURF PLANET.</description>
