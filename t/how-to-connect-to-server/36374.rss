    <description>-----Getting on a server-----


=-=-=Hamachi Servers=-=-=
First you will need hamachi, as most servers you need to have this to connect.
www.hamachi.cc and find download.
Click download and download the installer.
Install the installer and you should have hamachi, or for short, HAM.
When you open this file up, it should say
&quot;This is your first time using hamachi&quot; or something along the lines of that.
Follow the tutorial until you get to the end.
Now the customized things come in.
Now in the post on whatever forum you use, you should have at least 3 inportant details, the IP of the server; the HAM Network name; and the HAM password.
You must fill these into your HAM so you can connect.
Go down the bottom of the HAM window and click the middle button, the trianglular shape button. A scroll bar sort of thing should appear with join or create. You need to join.
I need to put down an example, sorry, but it is going to be my server! 

Ok for the top box, you have to type in, BobScape (Thats the name of the HAM name)

Ok for the bottom box, you have to type in, bob (Thats the password for the HAM network)

Press Enter. If you did this correctly, the box should disappear and in your HAM window, you should see BobScape with a few names under it. If you don&#39;t, repeat the window with the HAM name and the the HAM password. Find the name BobScape or the name of the &quot;Scape&quot; you are trying to enter near one of those names. If you cannot find one, search the server thread again, it may be in there. But if there is one there right-click it and click the one saying &quot;Copy IP address.&quot; Skip the NO-IP and go to the one after it.

=-=-=NO-IP=-=-=
This method is much easier than the first method. Now, you may come across a server thread with no HAM details in it at all. This is called a NO-IP server. This is where the owner/hoster of the server likes to have words in the server IP and no HAM. Usually, they will give you the IP address, which, as I said, is words. And, again, I need an example, and lucky, it&#39;s dipsetscape.no-ip.info You only have to have that and you can go to the next step.

-=-=Connection to the actual server=-=-=
Now, the final step, now we need a client, MoparScape. You can download it from http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,6915.msg70691.html
You should read that whole post, but if you are too lazy too, you have to download from the link provided there. Extract it to wherever, My Documents, My Desktop, just remember where you put it. Go to the file and find Moparscape, right-click it, and click extract here. It should extract and you get a folder with Moparscape on it. Double-click it and go into runMoparscape.bat or Moparscape.jar. But if you are lazy to do all that! Go to www.moparisthebest.com That&#39;s the webclient it is exactly the same. (Thats the one I use. Way easier!) So open up moparscape file and run that or go to www.moparisthebest.com and it should load everything, now you have two buttons on the screen, in the middle of the page, one is Enter, the other is Start Server. You need to click start server and wait for the cache loads. It only has to download once, so next time you click it, it will go instantly. After all that click &quot;OK&quot; and you should be back to main menu. Go to File in the top-left corner, click new server, ok Hamachi users, you need to get into that window by going down to the task bar. When done, you have to copy the IP address, if you have NO IDEA of what I am talking about, go back to the set-up of HAM. After copying the IP address go back to your Moparscape and past it there...Ctrl+V and the server IP should come up. Press Ok and start server. For NO-IP users, go into the server thread and find the IP address which is in words. Copy and paste that into the New Server window click Ok and start server. Now both HAM and NO-IP click enter and you should see Username, Password, Server IP. enter your wanted username is where? The username line. And the password in the password line. LEAVE THE SERVER IP. Do not use the same Username and password than your real runescape account. You could any original name you like and dont put your password as &quot;dfgsfd&quot; you need to be able to remember it.

Click the enter, login button and you should be logging into a server. If it says error. COnsult the owner/hoster if it is online, or offline. Ask what port it is. If it is different from 43594 (like mine) you have to go file, new port, the port the owner/hoster told you, ok, start server, ok, enter, login. If not you could have had had a mental breakdown and did the tutorial wrong.

Thanks for reading, downloading and coming to our forums, the best around, Moparscape!

              <p>Same exact tut thats in the questions section exept worded a bit differently.</p>
<p>Ok lol…If you want to know some Ham Ips the only ones that i know are<br>
OwnsPkScape47 (pass:123)</p>
<p>Make sure you put the exact capitals that i put. I won’t put Ip<br>
because then it will look like im advertising in the wrong section but that would be sad.</p>
<p>Anyways when you connect to the server just connect on the Moparscape client like you would regularly.</p>
<p>The thing with Hamachi is that you have to make sure that you use capitals when people put<br>
Capitals in the Ham network or it will not work</p>
<p>such as…OwnsPkScape</p>
<p>you can’t just put it as ownspkscape you need to add the capitals and any number that are<br>
supposedto be after it.</p>
<p>to join a server do click Join existing server<img src="http://imageigloo.com/images/3818Hamachi1.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>and then this will pop up <img src="http://imageigloo.com/images/9023Hamachi2.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>This is an example not all Ham networks will be like this.</p>
<p>[glow=black,2,300][size=20pt]Hamachi Premium[/size][/glow]</p>
<p>Hamachi Premium last for 30 days and you get a free month trial with your first download.<br>
To buy a month subscription you must have a credit card and will last for about 31 days.</p>
<p>With Hamachi premium you can add more servers and also you can join servers that would usually fill<br>
up with 16 people in it can now be like 256.</p>
<p>You can also more Networks if you are making Hamachi Servers</p>
<p>[glow=red,2,300]_____________________________________________________________________________________[/glow]</p>
<p>This is a guide i made for people from our server a little awhile ago.</p>
<p>If you feel this is good enough add this to your topic <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Hellz i feel like you are stalking me.</p>
<p>No matter people find the Hamachi topic used under the questions board a bit confusing and people<br>
told me this helped a bit and answered some of their questions.</p>
