<p>What ussaly keeps them is, challenging NPC’s, mini-games and maybe quest</p>
<p>also A Long lasting server also helps because if its ALWAYS on they’ll eventually tell other people to play and it justs spreads you know,</p>
<p>PKING is a big deal senice Runescape lost pking so always make pking fair but not to easy,</p>

<p>It has All skills working, apart from agility, Full combat, Full magic bonuses, defence bonuses, and delays, Full ranged projectiles, Perfect vengeance, Has the same Map as RS (Same NPC’s and Shops), Has the REAL Animated armours and Armour animator object (You use a piece of armour on the object, and it spawns An animated armour), Perfect pking, with the wilderness skull, Full Prayer, and headicons, All Potion’s work, Full RCing with perfect essance mining, and you right click and click teleport on the Mage of Zamorak, to teleport to the Abyss, Four working quests so far, two quests, two mini-quests (Lost city, Desert Treasure, Mage arena, and the Zamorak mage miniqyest), FULL Barrows, and ALOT of ways to make money.</p>
<p>The skills are Hard, and the Money is Hard.</p>

              <p>ye hustlin i do agree, having access to most of the map would be pleasant. Also seeing as i have made pking so close to runescapes inc wild level max 56 ect, it would be stupid to have fast training and stuff because everyone would get 126 sooner or later and most that stuff i added wont be as important as ect. a lvl 113 vs 94 having better bonus’. Ill definetly try my best on that idea</p>

              <p>Alot of times the more like old runescape it is the more attracted people are to it, thats why battlescape was so popular, had everything that old runescape had… Also ALOT of players do enjoy having quests to complete as long as they arent as hard as runescape quests, they come to private servers to get away from all of the bigger challenges in runescape… alot do anyways and this is what I look for in a server: A good economy, steady training, as many features as possible, access to alot of the map.</p>
