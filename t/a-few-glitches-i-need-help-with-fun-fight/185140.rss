    <description>ok i have a jagex server (a.k.a. silab&#39;s (i ahte that word)) and when you use a spell in fun fight and they die you stay and they get teled same with veng. some times when you challenge some one and you kill the person you didnt challenge he dies and [b]DOESNT![/b] keep him/her stuff

also i want to know how to add the interface for duel arena (the last one before the duel (the acceptance one)) that you have to click accept so you get teled to fun fight so you dont die and might lose your items where you have to accept before you go to fun fight.</description>

              <p>Like I said, for the last one find case 185 which is all of your action buttons. Find the interface ID and call it for the menu, and make it tele you when you click accept… It’s easy.</p>

              <p>If you’re talking about something like the person dies and they tele but you don’t see, it’s because the player who can still see the person hasn’t been updated. I solved this simply by doing this:</p>
<p>declare something like this:</p>
<p>public static boolean playerIsTeleporting = false;</p>
<p>then under your process(I know… I know…) add the following:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(playerIsTeleporting == true){
playerIsTeleporting = false;
teleportToX = absX;
teleportToY = absY;
}</code></pre>
<p>then whenever you have somebody teleporting just put at the end of your code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">playerIsTeleporting = true;</code></pre>
<p>It’s a simple fix… I know it’s not the greatest way at going at it, but it works 100% of the time and I don’t have time to make something beautiful for this at the moment. You might actually be able to replace the teleport with an updateRequired, but I’m not sure… I don’t play servers much anymore. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>And about your guys dying, add a boolean first like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">boolean funFightArea(){
if(absX &gt;= #### &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= #### &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= #### &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= ####)
return true;
else
return false;
}</code></pre>
<p>now at your applyDead boolean find the voids where you lose stuff, I think it’s pkZ() and youDied()… I’m not 100% so check.</p>
<p>Above all of the lose items booleans add the following:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(!funFightArea()){</code></pre>
<p>then after the lose item booleans just close the if statement }</p>
<p>Done…</p>
<p>As for interfaces, get an interface ID list and then just put the accept button under case 185. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
