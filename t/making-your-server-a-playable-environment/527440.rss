    <title>Making your server a Playable Environment?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-your-server-a-playable-environment/527440</link>
    <description>Lets say if there were a server that had tons of features or something. But, the thing is, the way they amde the server, its not in a playable environment. The player cant really get anything like helm of nietiznot or anything. Its just a plain server with a ton of features. It doesnt have that feel like if you were to log on and know what to do. Its all barren.

How would you make the environment &#39;playable&#39;?</description>

<p>The best games are the ones where the player can learn easily by messing around. If you create a tutorial or directly tell the player what to do, you’ve failed. The obvious answer is to create content. The right way to teach the player is to have NPCs that are doing the action and the player can try to follow.</p>

<p>It can be helpful to show players the basics of your server. Such as, simply showing them certain areas (more of the “basic”/“starter” areas) and explaining what they’re for. Though, I do agree with you, however, that you must create content in order to have an enjoyable environment. A little tutorial helping out the newcomers so they won’t be lost isn’t harmful at all. Though, making the tutorial too bland, too much explanation, too large, etc. could have fouls.</p>

              <p>Enjoyable and ‘playable’ (theirs a reason why i only ’ one of those words) are two completely different concepts and both are relative based on the person that is playing the game. I can instantly just tell your focusing too much of your attention on areas that aren’t important in comparison to more important but, basic areas i.e. who you want to please is much more important than how enjoyable the game is.</p>
<p>All in all, you shouldn’t bother posting without thinking things through. It just seems you spent a few minutes thinking an idea up and posted immediately.</p>
<p>tl;dr Don’t bother trying to improve your server to please your market if you don’t understand how to please your market.</p>
<p>I’ll leave this as a half assed post and not justify my logic.</p>

<p>Other thoughts: The server is never playable if you just have shops everywhere. Stop letting people be noobs and just buy what they need. They need to get off their lazy keisters and go get the items so they are EARNED.</p>
