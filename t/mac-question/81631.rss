    <title>Mac Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mac-question/81631</link>
    <description>I manually downloaded the cache.zip file, because every time I turned off my computer I would have to download it again. Anyway, I unzipped it in the MoparScape32 folder and... I still have to download the cache every time I restart. I&#39;ve played around with trial and error, but I can&#39;t seem to find wherever it&#39;s supposed to go... Do you know where I should put the cache folder on a Mac?  (OS X 10.4.9 if it makes a difference)

Either way, it is working now...</description>
