    <title>Need help brainstorming for dual wielding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-brainstorming-for-dual-wielding/75839</link>
    <description>hey, i really need help with adding on dual wield to my server; i was thinking that the simplest way would be to change it in the charecters menu. on my server equip 3 is weapon and 5 is shield, so i was wondering if there was a way to make it be like
equip = 1          -1          0
equip = 2          -1          0
equip = 3          -1          0
equip = 4          -1          0
equip = 3/5       -1          0
would something like this be possible or would i have to change a few weapons to &quot;equip 5&quot;? 

would it be easyer to add extra items with the same name, and look just different id number and equip number?
