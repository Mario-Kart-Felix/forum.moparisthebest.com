    <description>Hey guys,

Well, I was working with this today (MezzyScape 562 loading 659 v2), and I got this error 2 times in 1 day... And I don&#39;t feel like having this happen when it&#39;s online. Will this fix itself when I put it online and do the stuff to the client side, or will I have to do something to fix it :S If so please tell me! PS: It spits out no errors client sided and on the server side it does this: 
[code]log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (org.apache.mina.filter.execut
or.ExecutorFilter).
log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.[/code]

It does this every time I turn it on (doesn&#39;t give me the Error loading your profile thing on the client, just that error on server) and it doesn&#39;t give the client sided server. If anyone can help me that would be great! Thanks!
