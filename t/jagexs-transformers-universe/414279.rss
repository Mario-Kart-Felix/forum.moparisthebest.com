    <title>Jagex&#39;s Transformers Universe</title>

    <description>[center][img]http://transformersuniverse.com/sites/all/themes/transformers/images/visual-logo.png[/img][/center]
Well, Jagex and Hasbro are collaborating and making a browser based MMO called Transformers Universe. I&#39;ve done some research about the game and Jagex claims for it to be a more advanced game engine than RuneScape&#39;s, &quot;the next step in browser-based gaming from a graphical perspective.&quot; As Jagex said, so... Like RuneScape, but robots that can transform? Just seems like a pretty bad RuneScape, I am pretty excited to see the graphics though, since it is browser-based. I honestly can&#39;t wait for that. Though everything else seems pretty... RuneScape-like, haven&#39;t seen anything that&#39;s actually caught my attention and wowed me.

This will not be released to console, you&#39;ll need a computer and internet, the very same as you play RuneScape. The release date is estimated for 2012, and will be f2p, though some extra benefits you will have to pay for, just like RuneScape. This is turning out to be more and more like RuneScape by the second, doesn&#39;t it? F2p... More benefits, p2p... This seems just like a Transformers version of RuneScape. Nothing that makes me anticipate this game, look up the date, wait for it, blog about it, create a entirely new website dedicated to it, none of that. The development of this game seems quite boring.

Jagex says &quot;...It is an inspiration from the recent series, Transformers Prime... though it will carry a separate story-line.&quot; I mean, if you get inspired, take ideas from the show/movie, don&#39;t just make it like RuneScape, it seems quite a bit like RuneScape to me. Though I&#39;m excited to see what Jagex has to show, futuristic, transforming, Transformers... I&#39;d like to see more information about this, a few game-developer interviews, just to see the production. At least it has a story-line to it, though, that&#39;s something RuneScape lacks, you just login, learn how to do a few things, and play. At least Transformers Universe will have a story-line, or will it? Jagex does seem to have empty promises here and there. I hope Jagex doesn&#39;t ruin this like they did RuneScape, and I hope that they don&#39;t just release it to be almost exactly like RuneScape, so you make a character, login, and you get on and see it&#39;s almost the same as RuneScape; wouldn&#39;t that be a major turn-off? If they run out of ideas, they should hire someone to give them ideas. We&#39;ll just see how this goes.

              <p>Well, this seems kind of stupid. I wonder if this is going to be like RuneScape but like Robots. Or maybe like the game Adventure Quest (gay). Jagex is probably getting bored of RuneScape. I also wonder if people will make Transformer Universe Private Servers.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:">  :eek:</p>

<p>Apparently, Andrew owns 90% of the company’s share. I think he is making a new game too. At least, that’s what wikipedia said</p>

Also, Jagex have different teams for all of these different games (FunOrb, Stellar Dawn, Transformers, etc), so it won’t be affecting RuneScape development whatsoever.<br>
[/quote]Do you work at Jagex by any chance?[/quote]<br>
Totally.</p>
<p>It’s common fucking sense, RuneScape is their top priority and always will be. Even if they did send over some team members to help development you wouldn’t notice a damn thing.</p>
