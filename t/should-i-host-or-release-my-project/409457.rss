<p>OT - If it’s a RSPS, it doesn’t belong in this section <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Server Downloads is where you put those. If it’s just a general Java project, feel free to post it here. You can (usually) get some good critique.</p>

</aside>
<p>I lol at how people still complain about leeching. You release the source why the fuck complain about people using it? People are going to host it with a few changes anyways, plus every server that Ive played that I know the person complains about it being leeched after, I didn’t see them giving any credits any were on their forums or in the server? So… Yeah… A little rant…</p>
<p>This topic also isn’t allowed any where… It’s really up to you whether you release it or host it…</p>
