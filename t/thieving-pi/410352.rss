    <description>Everytime I steal from a stall, it gives me 1 coin and like 25000xp
when i steal again XP doubles, and keeps going like this.

I replaced thieving.java with another thieving base from some one,
what also didnt work, I removed everything from thieving (secondclickobject) in actionhandler
and still the same is happening  :confused:

Does anyone know what to do, Im out of options</description>
