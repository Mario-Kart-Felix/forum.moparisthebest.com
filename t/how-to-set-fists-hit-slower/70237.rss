    <title>How to set fists hit slower?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-set-fists-hit-slower/70237</link>
    <description>Hi,

I have a big problem since i started private servering, that when my charater doesnt have anything in its hand(unarmed) i try to fight an npc and it starts hitting it like CRAZY! 4 hits per second! Is there a way to make it slower? Because this makes my server too easy.

My server is testscape based.

I&#39;ve tried to look into pimpscape&#39;s client.java, and also project 16&#39;s, but i didnt find anything that would make the fists hit slower, but the fists DO hit slower on those servers. I also discovered an
[code]else {
wepdelay = 10;
pkingdelay = 10;
}[/code]near the very last of the &quot;if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == &quot;s but they are the same on all 3 sources. i tried to make a delay myself,
[code]if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == (-1)) //fists!
{
PkingDelay = 7;
wepdelay = 7;
}[/code]but it didnt work, and it also messed up the fists, i couldnt attack with them! How can i get this annoying thing to work? Any help would be appreciated.</description>

              <p>[quote=“Dell, post:2, topic:70237”]try .1 not -1[/quote]Tried but it didnt work, however no errors. should i put ‘else’ before the if? and should i put the ID  like [playerWeapon] == (.1) or [playerWeapon] == .1?<br>
I got the -1 ID from that at the select attack type thingy, it writes the name of the weapon, and the ID. It was: “Weapon:No Item ID:-1”</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
Nevermind, i got it to work!!! YAY!! all i needed to do is</p>
<p><code>if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] &lt;= (1)) //fists!
{
PkingDelay = 7;
wepdelay = 7;
}</code>and it works! anyways, thanks. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
