    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-hacking-group/2978</link>
    <description>I was thinking we could start a group for people interesting in client hacking and looking at the new runescape client. We would not need a website or anything, we could just talk together on msn. I am learning java now, so I would not be to much of a help :rolleyes: but I am sure I could do something. What do you guys think about this?</description>

<p>Ok. Here’s your answer. No. You can’t just hack someones MSN account, because people wouldn’t use it if it was so insecure. So, they need to have a strong ‘anti-hack’ system.</p>

Hacking the runtime class libraries is rather simple but your possibilities are limited. And runtime analysis is not possible which could be very useful. You can however do other useful things like redirect connections or disabling the RSA encryption which I already did in the past.<br>
PS: isn’t it a pity that having skill and having a lot of spare time are mutual exclusive <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

lol working with the client as it is now is near impossible, it’ll be easier to really hack it with C++ and generate events and steal information directly from the memory – Which is probably above most of this forum’s users if not all of them.</p>
<p>Learning Java to edit the client is useless now.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>You couldn’t be more wrong (well, maybe if you were suggesting that we all learn Ruby…:P)<br>
I tried exactly what you’ve suggested once, and let me tell you that hacking the VM (which is what you suggest) is much, much more difficult than overcoming almost ANY Java obstacle that Jagex throws at us.[/quote]<br>
Mind telling me which VM you used? Suns SCSL Source?<br>
And this guy might be right that it is simpler to properly recode the VM such that it easily allows us code/data inspection and code injection. It would be easier than always bother with new restructured client versions. If done properly, universal signatures can be used to trace data we seek. I have made some thoughts on this and came up with a couple of ideas, yet no time to implement and try those. One approach might be to monitor the “temporal evolution” (this could be done in a rather controlled way to reduce any influences of randomness, though, if done right, shouldn’t be a critical point) of each variable (be it global or local), method invokation, interelations between those objects and the like and create some reasonable data out of it on basis of a statistical analysis. This data should be feasible identify fields and methods of our interest.<br>
But the main advantage is, that there’s very little chance for jagex (unless they do a system scan which can be detected and prohibited easily <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> ) to detect a VM that was being tampered with.<br>
AFAIK, jegax randomly checks whether the client has been tampered with using reflection, and it requires quite some care to properly handle this. IHMO it is pointless to waste any more time on bots based on modified java clients. They can add new nuiscances as we speak here. One should not stick with outdated concepts, one should go with the time and eventually try something new. It is in our nature to advance (well, at least in mine and certainly some other people too).<br>
That said, I have to note that in order to realize such a project you’d have to be a <em>very</em> skilled and experienced coder (otherwise you’re not even able to understand how the VM works), of course you should be familiar with java/bytecode and also ASM knowledge is of advantage for the JIT engine. Plus you need to have a lot spare time to burn and your ambition shouldn’t be any less.<br>
I doubt anyone here falls into the class of fulfilling <em>all</em> the requirements.<br>
So this probably remains a vision :o</p>

<p>You couldn’t be more wrong (well, maybe if you were suggesting that we all learn Ruby…:P)<br>
I tried exactly what you’ve suggested once, and let me tell you that hacking the VM (which is what you suggest) is much, much more difficult than overcoming almost ANY Java obstacle that Jagex throws at us.</p>

              <p>I was thinking we could start a group for people interesting in client hacking and looking at the new runescape client. We would not need a website or anything, we could just talk together on msn. I am learning java now, so I would not be to much of a help :rolleyes: but I am sure I could do something. What do you guys think about this?</p>
