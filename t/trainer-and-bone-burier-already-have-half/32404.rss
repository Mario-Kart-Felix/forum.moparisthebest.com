    <title>Trainer and bone burier...already have half</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trainer-and-bone-burier-already-have-half/32404</link>
    <description>i have half of the script...its a auto seagull killer in port sarim...i was wondering if anyone could make and combine a bone picker upper and burier to go along with this script...i have only gotten it to work for 1 seagull...so idk what the issue is so if anyone cane beta it and fix it and them pm me the finished product?

orrr do that and then script a bone picker and burier to go along with that would be better...if someone does it then i will give half credit to that person...

if you need the first part pm me and ill send it too you...i dont want people to get it because i wanna make it a pay script but i cant figure this out. it will be 500k and the scripter will get it free also the script was originally coded by :yuhaiyang1 but hes banned so oh well...no point in wasting it ^^</description>
