    <title>Problem connecting to server!</title>

    <description>My problem is that I can not log in any server. IS the matter could be my internet, which is the wifi and which is located in dormitory??
I also can not use programs like vuze, utorrent. Download speed is 1b/sec and take time to download one song is 1-5 years  :confused:. I do not have access to the wifi settings, I can just use it. Is it possible that I can play in runescape private server? :rolleyes:

Than you!!</description>

              <p>1b/sec download speed is only using utorrent. If I’m using firefox to download, then the average speed is 1-1.5Mb/sec. I am more then 100% sure that client is not crashing, beacause connection is very good, it says excellent. Speed is 54Mbps. Is there anyone to say more about my problem, i would be very grateful.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 04, 2009, 04:37:23 pm[/size][hr]anything guys ?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 05, 2009, 06:08:36 am[/size][hr]anything guys ?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 06, 2009, 02:12:45 am[/size][hr]bump</p>
