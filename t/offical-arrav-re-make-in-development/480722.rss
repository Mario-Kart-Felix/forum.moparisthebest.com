He was within a conversation with me, and few of the Arrav developers when we talked about his consequences. At first, he wasn’t allowed to give out the official amount but I suppose he didn’t care after.[/quote]<br>
Oh I seee, either way, 17k is a lot.</p>

The least of my worries, I’ve been offered multiple positions because I was the manager for Arrav. And he and the second founder ended up being fined 17k EURO (not sure what that is in USD).

Rene doesn’t show his face around much anymore after the lawsuit. Sadly, I was there through the entire process and had to resign from Arrav after getting caught-up with some real life things.[/quote]<br>
