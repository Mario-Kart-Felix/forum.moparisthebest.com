    <title>How to NOT get banned using scar</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-not-get-banned-using-scar/20163</link>
    <description>Here are some of the easiest things I can think of/know of how to not get banned auto/macroing with scar. Most are commen sence buts its kinda annoying hearing people that complain about the scripts.

1st Off: Always use a script with atleast some srl in it. At the top it should contain atleast {.include SRL\SRL.scar

2nd: Never auto on a level 3 account!!! Are you dumb, almost every good person on runescape reports autoers now, espically the lvl 3&#39;s. I suggest gettin to atleast lvl 40+.

3rd: If you can use multiple accounts, USE MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS! If you have 9 accounts, and tell the script to change accounts every 30 miuntes, each account would only be used every 4.5 hrs! Thats alot less detecable then mining yew for 12 hrs on 1 account..

4th: If possible, NEVER auto on your main computer, unless your using a browser that changes/hides ur ip such as torpark. (sorry, proxys are too slow)

5th: Use common sence, if their script is supposed to be a 1337 coal miner, then it shouldn&#39;t be 100 lines.

6th: Don&#39;t and NEVER auto on ur main nor transfer stuff to your main.If you must transfer stuff to your main, I suggest selling the autoed goods, and then double log onto runescape with 2 different ips . Account 1-The account you autoed with. Account 2- The account that you never auto with. Then say on account 1: Need free stuff, or something to that extent, trade the cash and 2 random junk items. On account 2, put in like 10 junk items, accept trade. Now, get on ur normal ip, and repeat steps, just trade the goods from account 2, to your main.

7th: Dress your character! Make him look like a pure, people usally don&#39;t regonize Wiz Hat,Robe, D hiDe legs, and rune skim as a macroer.


I hope these steps well help prevent you from getting banned on runescape using scar. But face the facts, you eventaully well get banned. And I&#39;m not reliable if you get banned. The only person reliable if you get banned for macroing is YOU.

(I will add more ways to not get banned later)

Thanks. UNC</description>
