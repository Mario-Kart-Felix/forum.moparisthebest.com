<p>its the owners fault and as a german shepherd owner i don’t care what anyone else says.</p>
<p>I’ve also had a german shepherd cross doberman who was abused and you will not find a friendly dog towards humans. He was a lot of work but a year or so after, he’d walk home with anyone lol, absolutely loved people.</p>
<p>So ban inexperienced people with those types of dogs.</p>

When I used to live in haigh, the people who ran the local fish and chip shop had two rottweilers, the female who had had the dogs from around 7 weeks could do anything, she could make them play dead, she could put her hands and such inside their mouths and the dogs would just sit down, so basically steriotyping a dog because of the bad reputation by some accidents recently is utter bullshit.</p>

<p>That should be banned. Trust me, fucking completely horrible dogs. A few friends of mine have rottweiliers, completely harmless, however a few months back, I was living in a flat and the people above us had 2 american bulldogs, fucking horrible.</p>
<p>However, rottweilers that have been trained properly, won’t be savage. You can’t blame a dog for it’s unexperienced owners mistake.[/quote]</p>
<p>Since I was a baby my parents have had like 3 American bulldogs, and not ONE of them have been violent towards anything for no reason, one of the dogs attacked another on the grounds it went for my mother but that’s it, none have had to be put down because of voilent behaviour, they all died of natural causes.</p>

Yeah, there are some assholes who raise their dogs to be kiling machines, but that shouldn’t affect people who have dogs that are babies like mine  :D.</p>

<p>My friend had a French mastiff, best fucking dog ever. This dog could easily kill me at the ages of around 2 years old, since it was physically stronger than me. But it was the friendliest dog ever.  It hated being alone, but like all dogs they love to play and a dog that size it was hard to know when it was playing. But anyway, it died at 3 years old because of some growth in his stomach :(.</p>

Dogs shouldn’t be banned, mainly becausethey’re frigiin’ awesome. Yeah, there are some assholes who raise their dogs to be kiling machines, but that shouldn’t affect people who have dogs that are babies like mine  :D.</p>

<p>No. ANY breed of dogs can grow up to be killers (except for poodles maybe), and it’s all about how they are brought up. If they’re trained to be killers, they will be. <span class="bbcode-b">Training</span> dogs to be killers should be frowned upon, not just an entire breed of dogs.<br>

<p>No I’m saying that just because a dog is a pittbull doesn’t mean it’s a bloodthirsty killing machine.</p>
<p>If the owner is irresponsible than the dog can turn out nasty. But if your a good owner, you shouldn’t have a problem.</p>
