    <description>Welcome.

We have decided to give Darkened Combat a major re-vamp, as our player count has fallen rapidly, and we are lacking updates and activity.

 We are officially renaming Darkened Combat to Vitality/Project Vitality

             
[b][u]SKILLS[/b][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/RAAg5l.png[/img] Some skills will be re-written to improve varied glitches and to make them more in-depth. [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/RAAg5l.png[/img]


[U]Thieving[/U] -  Working pickpocketing with correct npcs and items, and stalls re-spawning their items.

[U]Firemaking[/U] - Fires clip so they cannot be placed on top of each other. Able to cook on a fire and gain different exp&#39;s values the high tier the logs.

[U]Farming[/U] - Use all farming patches available, along with tree planting and farming supply shops.

[U]Woodcutting[/U] - Trees re-spawning and leaving a stump when chopped down. Maybe lumber jack outfit bonuses and bird nests.

[U]Fishing[/U] - Fishing spots moving places when depleted, and correct items required to fish, with that item in the players hands.

[U]Herblore[/U] - Un-finished potions and all correct ingredients and potions. Ingredient grinding with pestle and mortar, i.e. Unicorn horn.

[U]Hunter[/U] - Feldip hills with birds, chinchompers, kebbits, imps, implings, butterflies. Impling jar claiming with random reward.

[U]Summoning[/U] - Scrolls and special effects working. Working RuneScape summoning interface with pouches that can be crafted being highlighted.

[U]Runecrafting[/U] - Rune multiplier and working talismans to locate specific altars.

[u][b]GENERAL GAMEPLAY IMPROVEMENTS[/b][/u][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/a1HQf.png[/img]General things which make gameplay more enjoyable and unique [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/a1HQf.png[/img]


Virtual points system - Points which can be redeemed for virtual things in-game i.e. a new emote or special character customisation.

Working buy-able newspapers - Untradable item which shows the latest server/client updates and announcements. 

Request assist system - No other server has this, and it would be great if we could get this working.

100% running, following and resting - right click the run icon to rest; restores faster when around a musician. 

New minigames - Zombie/Dragon minigames will provide fun activities for those players who are bored. 

Grand Exchange and 600+ maps - Working G.E would provide a good economy and easy trading. 

Fully working doors and double doors - All doors within Runescape working to make a massive area to play on. 

Working clue scrolls and rewards - Extra things for those veterans to do. 




[u][b]EVENTS/QUESTS[/b][/u][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/xuNBw.png[/img] We will be adding near to perfect random events, and some complete quests [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/xuNBw.png[/img]

Seasonal events - Halloween, Christmas, Easter and New Years Eve quests with a final untradable reward.

Cold War - Working penguin suit and penguin dialogues.

Dragon slayer - The hardest Rs F2p quest, must complete to wear certain items.

Tutorial Island - Working progress steps, must complete a certain task to carry on.


[u][b]WEBSITE/FORUM IMPROVEMENTS[/b][/u][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/G7bT8.png[/img] MySQL integration and player convenience [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/G7bT8.png[/img]


Adventure log - Shows all the players current activity and skills. Can be turned off. 

Improved highscores - Using minigames and new skills. 

Rank specific user panels - Important links and notifications according to current rank.  


[u][b]CLIENT UPDATES[/b][/u][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/10au5.png[/img] Several new interfaces and features [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/10au5.png[/img]


New client entirely - Maybe Galkon.

Auto-updating - Players don&#39;t have to re-download the client if it gets updated.

718 revision items and npcs - Huge boss list and drop tables so you cannot get bored.

New cache - Packing and more things included in it.

Custom maps - Along with new cache; custom maps, but not a great amount.

Music/Sound system - Sounds and music which can be unlocked and turned off/down.

New unlockable emotes/animations - Unlock new emotes with points, achievements and quests/events.

Working world map - Zooming and different layers.

Unique and custom in-game interfaces to make things more convenient.

We&#39;ve recently added WASD movement, you press the &#39;control&#39; button and it enters WASD mode, and you hit it again to go back to normal.


[u][b]COMMUNITY[/b][/u][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/R5FGJ.png[/img] Server ranks and positions [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/R5FGJ.png[/img]


Server support - Specific in-game and forums position who aid moderators by giving support and helping players with whatever they need. 

Developer - Developers get their own forums and game rank, with some permissions only they have. 

Advisor/Creative rank - These people advise the staff on what to do and also give feedback, criticism and ideas. 

Post count rank - The higher the forum posts you have, the greater your forums status will be. 

Donator ranks - Donator, Super Donator and Combateer ranks. Combateer has the most permissions and benefits. 

 

 


We will add-to and update this thread with our current progress and achievements.
Feel free to give ideas, as we need as many suggestions as possible.

We are trying to create a unique server with unique features.
We are also currently using Project Insanity as our base source, even though it has many flaws. 
If we can locate and patch these flaws it can become very reliable with a new or improved game engine.


Check out our [url=http://darkenedcombat.org/net/]blog[/url] to see our progress and activity.

We need all the help we can get!
We are looking for Client Developers, Server Developers and Web Developers

              <p>Welcome.</p>
<p>We have decided to give Darkened Combat a major re-vamp, as our player count has fallen rapidly, and we are lacking updates and activity.</p>
<p>We are officially renaming Darkened Combat to Vitality/Project Vitality</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[u]SKILLS</span><img src="http://i.imgur.com/RAAg5l.png" alt width="30" height="36"> Some skills will be re-written to improve varied glitches and to make them more in-depth. <img src="http://i.imgur.com/RAAg5l.png" alt width="30" height="36"></p>

<p><span class="bbcode-u">Woodcutting</span> - Trees re-spawning and leaving a stump when chopped down. Maybe lumber jack outfit bonuses and bird nests.</p>

<p>We are trying to create a unique server with unique features.<br>
We are also currently using Project Insanity as our base source, even though it has many flaws.<br>
If we can locate and patch these flaws it can become very reliable with a new or improved game engine.</p>
<p>Check out our <a href="http://darkenedcombat.org/net/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">blog</a> to see our progress and activity.</p>
<p>We need all the help we can get!<br>
