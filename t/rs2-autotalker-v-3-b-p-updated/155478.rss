Hope you guys dont think this Version is horrible.  :)

Please comment. This is my third1/2 official runescape script so this is as advanced as I get, give me a break.

Please Report Bugs. I am a very new scripter and can be and probaly will be refered to as &quot;noob&quot;.

There was a slight update in V.3. Those who have this downloaded or is using the script (Highly doubt it) do not have to redownload.

This script is extremely well for selling and buying items. Just input your text and it will randomize the different sentences.
The B.P stands for Better Protection since randomizing the sentences helps out the odds of being detected.

Havn&#39;t got any comments yet seems everyones busy -_- I told you I&#39;m a new scripter so comon cut me some slack.

Enjoy.
