    <title>Adjusting to the many new updates!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adjusting-to-the-many-new-updates/465008</link>
    <description>I used to play RS a lot when I was younger, but I lost my desire to play it about two years ago. I got on a few days ago to try a few things that I&#39;ve never done before, like Farming and other types of non-combat skills, and I&#39;ve actually started to enjoy the game again. I&#39;ve noticed a lot of different changes, both good and bad, but it shouldn&#39;t be too hard for me to adapt to them. I was wondering if anyone that played RS wanted to add me and chat about the game or something, because right I&#39;m casting high alchemy so I can get my Magic level to 85 for Ganodermic. 

To help keep this thread on topic to the board&#39;s description, post your favorite updates from this past year. I&#39;d have to say mine is the daily challenge system.</description>
