    <title>Linear Programming (Algebra 2)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/linear-programming-algebra-2/151986</link>
    <description>Ok, so my teacher didn&#39;t explain how to do this too well, could someone help me with this?

&lt;blockquote&gt;For his evening meal, Karl plans to eat fish sticks and mashed potatoes. Each ounce of fish sticks contains 5 grams of protein and 0.1mg of iron. Each cup of mashed potatoes contains 4 grams of protein and .8mg of iron. Karl wants to have at least 28 grams of protein and 2 mg of iron in his evening meal. If each ounce of fish sticks costs 30cents and each cup of mashed potatoes costs 69cents, how much of each should Karl eat to satisfy his dietary requirements while minimizing cost?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So basically, all I know is you have to set up a few different equations to make a graph, then you take the vertices of the feasible region and use those to find out the answer.

But, I have no clue how to even start. She only gave us one example, and she basically did it herself, and there was no time left in class for me to ask for help, so...

Any help is greatly appreciated!


Thanks,
Adam</description>

              <p>But that’s not the correct format of “Linear Programming.” I can’t just go along giving the incorrect work on the paper. I thank you for your attempt, but it’s just not what I’m looking for.

              <p>Wait I am reading it I will edit my post once I figure out the answer.</p>
<p>EDIT:Found the answer it’s 4 fish sticks and 2 mashed potatoes wish totals up to $2.58.</p>
<p>Ok here’s how I got it:</p>
<p>Mashed Potato:69 cents, 4 grams of protein, .8 mg of iron.<br>
Fish Sticks:30 cents, 5 grams of protein, .1 mg of iron.</p>
<p>If we bought 2 mashed potatoes for 69 cents each we would have 8 grams of protein and 1.6 mg of iron because 2x4 is 8 and 2x.8 is 1.6,right?<br>
Then if we bought 4 fish sticks for 30 cents each we would have 20 grams of protein and .4 mg of iron because 4x5 is 20 and 4x.1 is .4,right?</p>
<p>Now we add it up 20+8 is 28 grams of protein and 1.6+.4 is 2.0 mg of iron which gets us 28 grams of protein and 2.0 mg of iron.</p>
<p>Now we will get the money:</p>
<p>30x4=$1.20 and 69x2=$1.38 and then we add the money to get a sum of $2.58 because $1.38+$1.20=$2.58.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
