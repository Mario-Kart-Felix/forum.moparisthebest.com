    <title>Tobias&#39;s Final Server! (development team)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tobiass-final-server-development-team/158556</link>
    <description>[b]Yes you read correctly :) , this is my last server... ever! I might still come on moparscape from time to time to help people with their errors as I have been doing for the past few months. So I decided if im going to leave, I might as well make one final server. If ive ever helped you or you know me or you would simply like to help with my last server, please join! The name has not been decided yet, but hopefully we will think of one soon![/b]
[center][b]You may think &quot;CLASS! Tobias&#39;s final server, its gonna be great, too bad he wont want me in the team &gt;.&lt;&quot; Thats not true, no matter how skilled you are I want you. Please dont think that. I want this to be a community project. not a &quot;people good at servers only&quot; project. I will enjoy leaving mopar knowing I taught at least a few people while developing my last server. I thought it was important for you to know this.[/b][/center]
[center][u]How I plan to talk to everyone:[/u][/center]
Well, I have set up a hamachi network for us to talk on, but I cannot tell you the network name and password because it would be regarded as advertisement on forums and too many people would join it who arent even in the development team. So if your in it I will pm you pass and name.

I might still come on moparscape from time to time to help people with their errors as I have been doing for the past few months.

Well, I have set up a hamachi network for us to talk on, but I cannot tell you the network name and password because it would be regarded as advertisement on forums and too many people would join it who arent even in the development team. So if your in it I will pm you pass and name.<br>
