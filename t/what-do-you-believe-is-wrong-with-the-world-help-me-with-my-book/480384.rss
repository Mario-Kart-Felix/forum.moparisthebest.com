    <title>What do you believe is wrong with the world? (Help me with my book.)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-do-you-believe-is-wrong-with-the-world-help-me-with-my-book/480384</link>
    <description>Hey Moparscape community, recently I&#39;ve been working on a book that I&#39;ve put quite some time into so far. It&#39;s come along great so far, with 43 full pages already completed (no images.) However, I want some input from you guys, as I know the Moparscape community is full of great minds, and a lot of intelligent people. A quick few sentences on my book:

It&#39;s a book that goes through the past few decades of our society and world and show how it has slowly degraded. I&#39;ve spent the past two years studying sociology and critical theory lately, along with looking at patterns that society has followed. I&#39;ve come to the light on realizing what society has become, and how un-intelligent some are. I&#39;ll cover many things in this book, including a well explanation on how life is meaningless (this is not some dramatic, sad, depressing thought.) It covers religion and how it has held back our scientific progressions. And many other problems in the world, including a few chapters dedicated to social media sites on the internet (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)

What I&#39;m asking from the Moparscape community is a list of what they believe is wrong with the world. I know there will be some debating going on here, which is fine, as long as no flaming or disrespect occurs. It can be a simple list, as short or as long as you would like. Or you can go more in-depth and explain why you believe some of those things are wrong in the world.

Thanks to those who decide to contribute. Any recommendations that I use in my book will be thanked for, as I&#39;ll have a few pages of thanks to those who have helped contributed. I will not add your name unless you want me to (just say before your list if you&#39;d like me to; it can be your real name or Moparscape username.)

[b]The books title is set to be, [u][i]Degradation of The World[/i][/u].[/b]</description>

              <p>I’d prob say it’s more for the debates because some of the worst things in the world can also be thought of as good things and vice versa i.e. the human race.<br>
It can be thought of as a disease or it can be thought of as something good (nothings coming to mind atm for some reason but I’m sure theirs lots of examples lmao…).<br>
No thanks, that’s too vague for my liking.</p>
