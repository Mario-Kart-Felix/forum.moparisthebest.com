    <title>My recent sickness</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-recent-sickness/284558</link>
    <description>Hello, If you&#39;ve been on IRC you&#39;d know about my bad fever. I have a fever of 101.
I want to know if this is a natural symptom of having a fever. Well; today I woke up at around
6:00AM. Usually I wake up at 10-12AM. So I did what every person would do.. I tried to go back to sleep.
Unfortenetly, I wasn&#39;t able to. So at 6:00 I tried to get out of
bed. . I later found out that
my body was extremely week. My legs were twisting around, I was dizzy as fuck (When I got up to brush my teeth. Read on -&gt;). I went to go brush my teeth, and I couldn&#39;t stay standing up. I fell to the ground and hit my head of the 
sink counter. I blacked out for about 10 minutes. When I woke up. I crawled back to bed. And I&#39;m scared of getting
up because I&#39;m afraid something else might happen.. Right now I&#39;m on my father&#39;s personal Laptop. Both my parents
aren&#39;t home. What should I do? Does this sound natural to you?


EDIT: 
I spelt symptom wrong, And I used Chrome to fix it for me.. Now i have this..

<p>Oh and you were probably dehydrated. That gets you dizzy as hell. Perhaps drink and eat something.</p>

I’ll try to explain. I spelt “symptom” wrong. So I tired to use Chromes spell check feature. I right clicked; and clicked on “symptom”. Now it won’t go away. It just sits there…</p>

<p>Thanks for the opinions. I’ve drank about 6 bottles of gatorade. And I’m feeling a bit better.</p>
