    <title>How does an interpreter work? Implementing a language?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-does-an-interpreter-work-implementing-a-language/535505</link>
    <description>Sorry if the title was a little off, didn&#39;t know what to title this. 

Out of general interest; I was wondering how hardware works and what&#39;s behind creating a computer, all the software/hardware, interpretation, compiling etc.

I wanted to know how the computer knows what machine language is, I mean like if you take a computers boot loader as an example, it&#39;s written in assembly but how does the computer know what assembly is? Sure an interpreter does that but then how does the interpreter know what to do or tell the computer what it is? 

I know its compiled into byte-code but the computer somehow knows what to do with the instructions its given.

How is everything implemented?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Programming_language_implementation - needing more expansion to whats on here since it&#39;s not as detailed as I&#39;d like.

Sorry if I sound stupid lol :p

Edit: Graham give me a nice informative insight on how CPU&#39;s execute machine code. 
Was a cool read on how old CPU works https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_RISC_pipeline

I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s all down to the ALU http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit

Just lots of complicated stuff lol</description>

<p>i’d recommend devouring the whole book, but the first 4 or so chapters should answer a lot of your questions.</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>maybe dragon book for your questions on language implementation? it covers pretty much everything behind languages and compilers. idk how comfortable you’d be with it though, it’s certainly not as “easy” as PFTGU.</p>
<p>if there’s anything more specific that you want to ask, don’t be afraid to.</p>
