    <description>Hey, I&#39;m kind of new to this stuff, and I am having some problems with editing some of the codes. Currently, I am using testscape. Whenever I try to edit the code names, I am sure I am doing it right. So I save the client.java, and restart the server. The codes were not changed in anyway and inside client.java still has my edits in it. So basically I am doing it right, it&#39;s just not showing up in game. Does anyone know the problem and what I can do to fix this? Thanks in advance.</description>

              <p>Actually, I found the problem by myself. The compiler wasn’t working correctly because I didn’t have the right Java installed. Thanks for the suggestions anyway.</p>

              <p>listen…this problem can be solved one way…if you look in your data folder in your source…theres client.java and one in the front…like the source folder were it shows all folders. Take the one in data folder replace it with the one thats in there. Should work it worked for me <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
