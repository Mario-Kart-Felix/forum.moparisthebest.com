    <title>[562] IPBan, Mute &amp; Ban System not working [562]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-ipban-mute-ban-system-not-working-562/382946</link>
    <description>Hello,

I&#39;ve been developing a 562 server the original name for it was corruption x. But i&#39;ve changed alot of things like the ::home and more...
I am hosting it and have friendly players playing. 1 Day i&#39;ve had a spammer coming in to the server. I&#39;ve muted him, he still could talk, I banned him he got forced to log out. He was banned but could log back in, Then i tryed IP Ban and the same thing happened. I developed my own Jail command which locked him into a room where he couldnt get out.

Since then i had alot of spammers advetising on my server and more, Jailing them wasn&#39;t enough they just kept making accounts, So i closed the server.

I want to fix the server, I&#39;ve been looking for help on rune locus and on rune server. But i could never find my topics because their forums are that bad that they dont have the &quot;Show new replies to your posts.&quot; button. So i decided to ask people here.

Does anyone know a good tutorial? or can help me out?
Please help me the MS Community. I&#39;ve been trying to fix this for 3 months but nothing ever has worked. :(

Thanks,

Sam.</description>
