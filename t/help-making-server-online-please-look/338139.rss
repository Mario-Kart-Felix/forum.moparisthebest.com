              <p>ok i was having this problem also and i was really worried but i found the answer. first of all the only way you can log in is with 127.0.0.1 idk why vista and windows 7 roll that way lol so in order for you to know if its working first thing to do is go to<br>
<a href="http://canyouseeme.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://canyouseeme.org/</a> and type in the port your using for your server most likely 43594 then see if it says success i can see or i cant see or something. if it sees that means your on and have a friend or me (just pm me) try it out with ip cuz you cant log in with your own ip you can only log in with 127.0.0.1 so me i had my friend test it out with my ip and he logged in -.- i was working for months cuz i couldnt log in when i put my ip but i guess thats just how it is lol PM me if you want me to try or if you need more help</p>
<p>Goodluck!</p>
