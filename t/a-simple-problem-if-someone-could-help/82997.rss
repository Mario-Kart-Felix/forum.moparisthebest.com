    <title>A simple problem if someone could help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-simple-problem-if-someone-could-help/82997</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not that big of a noob but i was woundering if anyone could help me create a msn bot that could talk to people. Sort of like spleak(spleak@hotmail.com). My reason for doing this is i think it would be a great learning expiriance. Well repost if you want to join me for this project.</description>

<p>okey, so i will studie more of the code of SCAR and if it dosent work out with SCAR then how would i get the program that spleak or smarter child uses</p>
<p>I’ll keep it in scripting help for a few obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Lets start, bots like spleak and smarterchild don’t use programs like SCAR, they use modified clients or programs that can get text from the windows even when covered, then a reply is made. Something similar is done with IRC responders, gets the text from the program and replys(if possible).</p>
<p>However, when making one in SCAR, you need to consider the:<br>
Font<br>
Font size<br>
Font color<br>
How to get the text</p>
<p>You also need to think out the following:<br>
Am I doing this the best possible way?<br>
What other ways could I do this?</p>
<p>I thought of something while posting this, if you double click the line space when someone messages you, it selects it all if it’s on one line.<br>

<p>Careful robbee. I got warned for doing that by freddy1990 because he thought it was spam. Your message was inside the quote which was “okey, so i will studie more of the code of SCAR and if it dosent work out with SCAR then how would i get the program that spleak or smarter child uses”. You might want to edit your post because i don’t want you to get warned.</p>
<p>And yes it was be quite hard and i am not that good of a scripter to do so. Sorry for not doing it.</p>
