    <description>First of all, Moparscape FTW :D

Next, anytime i try and log into a server or create my own, it first seems like its going to work, load the server msg of the day etc. but then instantly logs out, below (in the cmd area) it says 


&quot;Error: T2 - 65,81,73 - 32,2724,3485 - 0,3-122,-84,18,-12,16,-109,20,62,16,71,42,-43... and it goes on..&quot;

Anyone figure why its doing this? One server thats seems to take maybe a second longer to dc me is &quot;farcastdreams.no-ip.biz&quot;  

Help please.</description>
