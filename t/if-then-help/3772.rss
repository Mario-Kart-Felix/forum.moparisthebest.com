    <title>If...Then Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/if-then-help/3772</link>
    <description>Well I am writing a fishing script for a game called TWO.
Anyways the fish dont come at a constant rate. You may get 1 fish after another in 2 seconds and then have to wait another 5 seconds for the next fish. My script fishes 3 fish, then moves on to the next spot and fishes 3 fish, then to the next spot and so on. I want to do it so that if it stands in one fishing spot and gets less than those 3 fish, it will move on. How do I do this?

I also want to do it so that when the script is terminated the client window is closed. Is there any way to do it without giving a command to click the mouse on the &#39;x&#39; button.</description>
