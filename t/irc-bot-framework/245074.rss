<p>There’s only a few bots programmed by a team of developers. Not even my own bot written in PHP can last on every network, but I’ve been successful with a lot of networks so far.<br>

I don’t see the difference between a client and a bot, one just doesn’t have a GUI displaying the information, and is used remotely.[/quote]<br>
Wrong. A client does not require a GUI system and a bot does not have to be used remotely. A client simply means it takes what the server is giving it, processes it, and performs the corresponding task. A bot can be ran locally and it’s purpose is to perform tasks for you (automatically - see my definition of a client). In fact, they are very close to the same thing but we associate the terms with different meanings because of this community’s upsession with botnets.</p>

</aside>
<p>If you read the post Cain_ made, you’d find that he<br>
a) doesn’t like the code written by LIBRIUM,<br>
b) prefers to send JOIN after the 001 status,<br>
c) doesn’t like LIBRIUM’s code.</p>
<p>There’s absolutely nothing wrong with sending JOIN at the point of 001 status; not one bot can achieve a full successful connection, identify with the network, and establish a connection with a channel. All IRC server software is unique in its own way, for example, SlashDot.</p>
<p>Now, there’s no need to give this guy a hard time for his code. I’ve been talking with him on Ventrilo and he has some good plans for this bot of his. There’s no need for this nonsense about “He’s from moparscape” or  how to “not write the code dastardly”. Post a respectful suggestion, not an egotistical suggestion.[/quote]<br>

</aside>
<p>Bots are clients, in the server’s view. I thought Cain_ referred to clients as IRC clients with GUI’s (xchat, mIRC, PJIRC, etc.). From my experiences, I believe bots are clients and can be controlled by other clients, depending on the bot’s setup. To get a true IRC with the 100% protocol down and getting everything working can take a long time if you build your own methods for parsing the buffer that is sent by the IRC server. What we’re dealing with here is someone who wants to build a bot (or Zombie as it seems to be in his code), which has commands setup for other clients to use for their convenience, and it seems to me that he’s not going to use a library, so he has to follow the RFC’s.</p>
<p>I think I was interpreting Cain_'s message on the “JOIN after 001” wrong, since RFC is the most important part of writing an IRC bot, and I completely forgot about them.</p>

Well, they’re both just as good. Cain_ was showing him what he did wrong when he picked his code apart, it isn’t Cain_'s obligation to spoon-feed the OP with the correct answer. It is the poster’s responsibility to then research and find what he is doing wrong, and if he is struggling with this I am sure Cain_ would tell him why.</p>
