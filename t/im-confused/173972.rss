    <description>Ok so Id like to use a client because soooo many clients look better than silabs client
Also I run a server
When ever I try a client out all the ids are different then the item slots
so if i want to use a client do i have to completly redo all the item id&#39;s to the new id&#39;sones and put them in the correct area?

that just seems like alot of work, and it doesnt seem like other people who host servers do that?

am i correct or am i doing something wrong</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>in item.java</p>
<p>you have to move all the ids to where you want it to go</p>
<p>for example: let’s say an attack cape is 14052</p>
<p>in item.java</p>
<p>you have to find capes and add in 14052</p>
