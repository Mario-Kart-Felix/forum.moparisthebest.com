    <description>Alright so I am running Project Insanity and I have 2 problems I want to get fixed.

#1. When you thieve at a stall and your inventory gets full it says your inventory is full, but keeps thieving and gaining xp how can I stop this.

#2. When someone trades a player you cannot click the button to accept it you have to manually right click and trade them any fix?</description>
