<p>You should be so lucky as to not have been caught. A friend of mine, IT for a UPS Distribution Center in Kentucky. He was downloading so much stuff illegally, it was crazy. He got caught TWICE, and got off scott free. He has an open Network, so he said someone else on his network must’ve been doing. He was caught downloading the sixth season of The Sopranos the first time, the second being a Tim McGraw CD.</p>

<p>About the signature tutorial I said you should start out with. That was just a tip, everyone needs to start somewhere, most people start wish grunge, because simple grunge sigs are just brushing and a render, it’s an easy way to make simple but quite good looking signatures. Now of course that doesn’t meet the standards of the people here, or may. But it’s easy to do. And you may like the results.</p>
<p>I just don’t like GIMP, there are key features of PhotoShop GIMP doesn’t have. The interface of GIMP is confusing, and it’s got some major set backs. Give PhotoShop a try. I bet you’ll like it once you get past it’s short learning curve.</p>

<p>wonderfull tip. Although i never do grunge i might give it a try. Secondly not a big fan of ppl that try to tell me to dl ps for 2 reasons. One i use gimp and have never had a problem with using it. It is a perfectly usable program which i enjoy making gfx on. Secondly ps is for windows 2000 and newer. Im running on 98[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s sweet. Making cool sigs on a 98!</p>
<p>[quote=“ThAt0n36Uy, post:30, topic:182824”]Javis, let me upload a trail copy of PhotoShop 7.0, that’s what I have on my jumpdrive, it does just as good as CS. Or I could give you a trial of CS, which is also quite small.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-s">About the signature. There is no focal, too much is going on. The colors contrast to much, as well as being to close on the color wheel. Reds and Purples are good in moderation, but overall you used them too much. It’s quite blurry, and I can’t tell the action that Sonic is doing, most of what I see is his face alone. I don’t really see any way of improving the image. You might would be better off just getting an old copy of PhotoShop and start with the basics.</span></p>
<p>EDIT: Never mind, I took a second look at it, and it’s a bit different the second time around. I can see his body quite well, but the action he is doing is hard to tell. You said it’s of him kicking a ball. But I can’t see that, nor the ball itself. Sonic is already blue, and using a color almost to that of his coat of fur. It really smothers him. I can see a red looking thing. Not sure of what it is exactly. But it really doesn’t have anything to do with the rest of the image, it may be that you’re trying to balance the sig out, but it really has no purpose within the signature. There is no border, which isn’t such a problem, but I just wanted to point that out.</p>
<p>The biggest tip I can make for you is to get a copy of PhotoShop, I’ll give you a copy. I’ll even let you use the Activation Key I have. It’ll be much better for you in the long run. People say open source is better, but that’s not always true. Especially with GIMP. I very rarely ever see anything good come from GIMP. And never from these forums. Once you get a copy of PhotoShop, find a tutorial for the basics, or just mess around for a few hours, that’s how I first learned. After that, look for a tutorial for loading brushes. Go to DeviantArt and search for some brushes, I’d look for some gurnge brushes, and then some abstract brushes, and any you might like.</p>

<p>I’ve always wanted to try photoshop but i didn’t feel like paying the money. Could you upload a link for me and let me try it out? =D<br>
