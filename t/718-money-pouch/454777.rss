    <title>718 Money Pouch</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-money-pouch/454777</link>
    <description>Hey,

Well... I have tried everything possible to fix this problem with my money pouch. I cannot withdraw my money in my pouch. I have tried Running Scripts but I suppose I&#39;m not running the correct one unless that&#39;s not how to fix it. If anyone can give me the Code for adding withdraw please do so, and you don&#39;t have to tell me where to add it.

Also, everytime I close my pouch and open back up it shows my money at 0gp. If I add more gp to it, it gives me my money back plus whatever I added. But if I reopen and close it, it will do the same thing. I have tried saving the money through player.java buy can&#39;t get it right lol.

If anybody can help me with this I will Rep++ and give you my vouch for being awesome helper. I need this and I cannot get it right...

I hope I get help :) pce</description>
