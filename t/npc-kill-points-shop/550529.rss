    <title>NPC Kill Points Shop</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-kill-points-shop/550529</link>
    <description>I have looked on google for a tutorial on this, but could not find one, only found a pk shop tut, and that one wasn&#39;t even good. I don&#39;t think it should be too hard? just edit shophandler.java, shops.cfg, and actionhandler.java, and shopassistant.java? i just dont know what to add.. can someone provide me with a little bit of help ?  :palm: i have the npc kill points system up and everything, like the point system is working. just need a shop that i can purchase items out of with these points. Thank you</description>

              <p>If there is already a slayer point shop or anything similar that doesn’t use items as currency, try using that as a base. I’m sure you can use any of the PK point tutorials in order to accomplish what you’re trying to do.</p>
