    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dragon-claws-with-no-special-bar/354048</link>
    <description>ok so i added DClaws to my server but they dont have a special bar. this is the only weapon without a special bar in my server. the special is working though, you just have to hit the special bar then switch to the claws. so any help on how to add the special bar?</description>
