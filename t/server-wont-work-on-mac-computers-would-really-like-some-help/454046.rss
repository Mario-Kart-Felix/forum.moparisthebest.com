    <title>Server wont work on Mac computers, would really like some help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-wont-work-on-mac-computers-would-really-like-some-help/454046</link>
    <description>I am in the process of coding and running my server, and we have a .jar run file for Mac users to launch the client. Like I said, it runs perfectly for all Windows users, but Mac users get stuck and eventually when they log in the connection times out. I dont understand it, and would really like some help. Thanks.</description>
