    <title>Funniest Words You Know</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/funniest-words-you-know/369262</link>
    <description>Just post the funniest words that you know.

Optional: Post the definition of that word too.

Funniest word I know; I&#39;d have have to say &#39;asperger,&#39; pronunciation: (ass-burgers).
It means: children who lack non-verbal communication skills, demonstrates limited empathy with their peers, and are physically clumsy.

Seems kind of mean saying that&#39;s the funniest word I know, but it&#39;s pronounced funny.</description>

<p>“lock stupid topics”[/quote]<br>
There’s plenty of stupid topics, I’d like to join in on that.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-post="3" data-topic="369262">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 Liquid Magic:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>why do you have a bill gates quote in your signature?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Because Bill Gates makes an excellent point when he says what he does in my signature.</p>
<p>“Life’s not fair; get used to it.”<br>
-Bill Gates<br>
He never went through college, yet he’s in the top 3 richest men in the world, and makes his employees go through a test before they can get the job.<br>
I find that ironic and funny.</p>
