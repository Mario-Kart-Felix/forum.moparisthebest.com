This is called the &quot;Rugrats Theory&quot;, read it all, its pretty interesting.
_____________________________________________________________________________
The Rugrats really were a figment of Angelica&#39;s Imagination.

Chucky died a long time ago along with this mother, that&#39;s why Chaz is a nervous wreck all the time.

Tommy was a stillborn, that&#39;s why Stu is constantly in the basement making toys for the son who never had a chance to live.

The DeVilles had an abortion, Angelica couldn&#39;t figure whether it would be a boy or a girl thus creating the twins 
-----------------------------
As for &quot;All Grown Up&quot; Angelica was a bipolar schizophrenic who, as a teenager became addicted to various Narcotics, bringing her back to her childhood and thus her creations she obsessed over, because of time lapse between the present and the last time she interacted with her creations, she made them older, Angelica was constantally taking hits of acid, so she would never have to live without her creations who were her only company, in a judgemental world

Angelica&#39;s mom actually died of a heroine overdose, Angelica was schizophrenic/bipolar because she was a crack baby, additionaly Drew in his depression married a gold digging whore, that Angelica idolized because she fooled herself into thinking it was her real mom, but always had a concept of her mom, Cynthia, and took a barbie doll, and made it after her mom&#39;s image, wearing an unwashed oranged dress, and having jacked up hair, which is why she was so attached to it, later in life she followed in her mom footsteps w/ drugs and everything, dieing of overdose at age 13 when All Grown Up! was &quot;canceled&quot; 

The only rugrat not to be fictional however, was unborn Tommy&#39;s brother Dil, however Angelica didnt know the differace between Dil and her creations, Dil didnt follow her commands, after endless crying and a refusal to disapear like the others did when angelica was angry with them, she hit him. And she hit him, screaming a screaching tune, Stu ran in and pulled his neice off of his only child, but it was too late, he had a brain hemerage, which resulted in a deformation, as he grew up his damage only became more evident, by the time he was 9 in All Grown Up! He lived as an outcast, being ridiculed for his weirdness, and retardation, the immense guilt over this is what led to her drug use and is what led Angelica to un-create the rugrats breifly, until her expericance w/ hallucinogenics.

On a trip to Paris to find love, Chaz married a hooker named Kira (He was actually going to marry a differant hooker, but she just wanted him for his money), who had a daughter named Kimi that was torn from her because she was a cocaine addict (Angelica imagined her from Kira&#39;s stories), he lost his mind after the death of his wife and was in denial that she was ever prostitue, upon return to America, Chaz and Kira married and she got her greencard, it was actually a really happy/romantic story, Kira continually stuggled with addiction, but was relatively happy w/ her life, and Chaz

Suzie was actually Angelica&#39;s only friend, who entertained the thought of Angelica&#39;s creations, for her, She later became a phycologist and teamed up w/ Nickelodeon to make the Rugrats! When Angelica died of drug overdose, she helped arrange her funeral, Angelica&#39;s death was sad, because of her addiction, she was expelled from society, which lead to a break with reality, and her eventual death, she spent the last days of her life in the back of the school cafeteria, imagining friends around her, and playing with the lives of her creations.


Yes, the cartoon has the babies as real people because of adult interaction with them. But, do you think that nickelodeon could&#39;ve gotten the idea of Rugrats from this tragic storyline? I bet somewhere out there something like this has occurred.</description>

<p>In one of Disney’s finest rip-offs to date, The Lion King hyenas were the mangy lowlifes who tried to kill Simba, assisted in the assassination of Mufasa and utterly destroyed the Pride Lands after helping Scar take over as king. Jesus, what is those assholes’ problem?</p>
<p>Hold on a minute there:</p>
<p>They want something to eat. That’s their problem, and it’s only a problem because Mufasa banished them from the Pride Land and forced them to live in an elephant graveyard, which is no place to raise a child, hyena or otherwise. We never know why they were banished to the Pride Slums, leaving us to assume Mufasa’s unedited explaination of the Circle of Life went something like this:</p>
<p>Mufasa: Everything you see exists together, in a delicate balance. As king, you need to understand that balance, and respect all the creatures-- from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope.</p>
<p>Simba: But Dad, don’t we eat the antelope?</p>
<p>Mufasa: Yes, Simba, but let me explain. When we die, our bodies become grass. And the antelope eat the grass. And so we are all connected in the great Circle of Life.</p>
<p>Simba: Wow… Say, Dad, where do the hyenas fit into the great Circle of Life?</p>
<p>Mufasa: Ugh, the hyenas. No, f#<span class="mention">@k</span> those guys.</p>
<p>Simba: Yeah, that’s fair.</p>
<p>That’s the only way to explain how Scar got an entire army of these animals behind him with such dissident slogans as “Stick with me, and you will never go hungry again!” Scar wasn’t promising them unlimited power, just the ability to eat and function as members of society. The hyenas were pissed because the oppressive lion regime had reduced them to second-class citizens, hoarding all the pie for themselves.</p>
<p>No wonder they followed Mufasa’s brother. What Scar offered the hyenas was a revolution of the common man. He was more or less their four-legged Lenin.</p>

              <p>Where did this come from?</p>
<p>Edit: Really just another conspiracy theory to ruin a perfectly good childhood show. The wikipedia article on rugrats explains the origins, which make far more sense than this load of tosh.</p>
<p>Just sayin.</p>

              <p>•Rolf was first to arrive, he immigrated from the old world to the neighborhood (it didn’t look like it does in the cartoon), died in the 1900s and kept his animals and his old-world farming sensibilities from that time<br>
•Jonny had no friends so Plank became his imaginary friend, died in the 1920s. He kept Plank along with him.<br>
•Eddy came next in the 1930s. His scheming nature stems from his experiences during the Great Depression, doing anything to get what little money he can.<br>
•Sarah and Ed came next in the late 40s. The cul-de-sac now sort of looks like it does in the cartoon, preplanned developments were popular then. Their mother was a hard worker and Sarah learned her attitudes from that. Ed just shut it all out, becoming preoccupied with the comic books and movies that were cropping up and becoming popular with kids during that era. They both died in the 1950s, perhaps a car accident.<br>
•Nazz was next, a flower child of hippies in the late 60s. Died in the 70s.<br>
•Edd, the son of two controlling business people, prone to abusing him and giving him his meek and introverted style. Died in the late 80s of a head wound which never healed / scarred horribly, which is why he always wears the hat.<br>
•Kevin’s father was abusive as well, so he would ride his bike to escape and bully others because that’s all he knew. When he died of a bike accident in the 90s, he shut out his father’s old identity, pretending that his life now was with a father that gives him gifts and stays out of his way.<br>
•Jimmy is last, died in the early 2000s, probably of a terminal illness.<br>
•The Kanker sisters are the guardians of the cul-de-sac, there to trip anyone up anytime someone gets the notion to venture too far away.<br>
◦That doesn’t exactly explain brutally attacking the Cul-de-sac when they lost their ship in a bottle, if they were guardians, they probably wouldn’t care about that, unless it was some sort of Artifact of Doom.</p>
<p>WILD GUESS THEORY</p>

<p>This is called the “Rugrats Theory”, read it all, its pretty interesting.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Rugrats really were a figment of Angelica’s Imagination.</p>
<p>Chucky died a long time ago along with this mother, that’s why Chaz is a nervous wreck all the time.</p>
<p>Tommy was a stillborn, that’s why Stu is constantly in the basement making toys for the son who never had a chance to live.</p>
<h2>The DeVilles had an abortion, Angelica couldn’t figure whether it would be a boy or a girl thus creating the twins</h2>
<p>As for “All Grown Up” Angelica was a bipolar schizophrenic who, as a teenager became addicted to various Narcotics, bringing her back to her childhood and thus her creations she obsessed over, because of time lapse between the present and the last time she interacted with her creations, she made them older, Angelica was constantally taking hits of acid, so she would never have to live without her creations who were her only company, in a judgemental world</p>
<p>Angelica’s mom actually died of a heroine overdose, Angelica was schizophrenic/bipolar because she was a crack baby, additionaly Drew in his depression married a gold digging whore, that Angelica idolized because she fooled herself into thinking it was her real mom, but always had a concept of her mom, Cynthia, and took a barbie doll, and made it after her mom’s image, wearing an unwashed oranged dress, and having jacked up hair, which is why she was so attached to it, later in life she followed in her mom footsteps w/ drugs and everything, dieing of overdose at age 13 when All Grown Up! was “canceled”</p>
<p>The only rugrat not to be fictional however, was unborn Tommy’s brother Dil, however Angelica didnt know the differace between Dil and her creations, Dil didnt follow her commands, after endless crying and a refusal to disapear like the others did when angelica was angry with them, she hit him. And she hit him, screaming a screaching tune, Stu ran in and pulled his neice off of his only child, but it was too late, he had a brain hemerage, which resulted in a deformation, as he grew up his damage only became more evident, by the time he was 9 in All Grown Up! He lived as an outcast, being ridiculed for his weirdness, and retardation, the immense guilt over this is what led to her drug use and is what led Angelica to un-create the rugrats breifly, until her expericance w/ hallucinogenics.</p>
<p>On a trip to Paris to find love, Chaz married a hooker named Kira (He was actually going to marry a differant hooker, but she just wanted him for his money), who had a daughter named Kimi that was torn from her because she was a cocaine addict (Angelica imagined her from Kira’s stories), he lost his mind after the death of his wife and was in denial that she was ever prostitue, upon return to America, Chaz and Kira married and she got her greencard, it was actually a really happy/romantic story, Kira continually stuggled with addiction, but was relatively happy w/ her life, and Chaz</p>
<p>Suzie was actually Angelica’s only friend, who entertained the thought of Angelica’s creations, for her, She later became a phycologist and teamed up w/ Nickelodeon to make the Rugrats! When Angelica died of drug overdose, she helped arrange her funeral, Angelica’s death was sad, because of her addiction, she was expelled from society, which lead to a break with reality, and her eventual death, she spent the last days of her life in the back of the school cafeteria, imagining friends around her, and playing with the lives of her creations.</p>
<p>Yes, the cartoon has the babies as real people because of adult interaction with them. But, do you think that nickelodeon could’ve gotten the idea of Rugrats from this tragic storyline? I bet somewhere out there something like this has occurred.</p>
