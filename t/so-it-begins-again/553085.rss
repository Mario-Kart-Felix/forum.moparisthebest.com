    <title>So it begins again</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/so-it-begins-again/553085</link>
    <description>I was once a very active member of these forums... granted that was when this was a thriving booming community I was young with a very short attention span.. so I never really got to the level of knowledge I would have liked to have achieved and over the past few years what little knowledge i did accumulate has left me. I&#39;ve began reading tutorials on oracle and other websites after my interest in programming has rekindled.. I have higher aspirations than just creating another useless RSPS but I do not remember how to even launch a program that i&#39;ve written without the use of a IDE and since the computer i&#39;m using at present isnt good enough to even attempt to run netbeans or eclipse i really am at a loss..

I would like to find some like minded individuals also interested in being more than just another copyright claim on Jagex&#39;s long list not to help me learn.. instead to learn with me and progress to the pinnacle of programming knowledge.

Is there anyone on this forum that is interested in embarking on a adventure of knowledge</description>

              <p><span class="bbcode-b">Compiling Java Source Code</span></p>
<p>Before the Java virtual machine (VM) can run a Java program, the program’s Java source code must be compiled into byte-code using the javac compiler. Java byte-code is a platform independent version of machine code; the target machine is the Java VM rather than the underlying architecture. To compile a Java source code file Foo.java, you would do the following:<br>
% javac -g Foo.java<br>
The -g command line option is optional, but we recommend using it as it makes debugging easier.<br>
If there are no errors in your source file, the Java compiler will produce one or more .class files (one .class file for each class defined in the Foo.java source file). For example, the results of a successful compile of Foo.java will produce a byte-code version of the class in a file named Foo.class.</p>
<p>Every public class that you write must be in a separate .java file where the first part of the file name is identical to the class name. The .java file additionally can contain code for protected and private classes.</p>
<p>We suggest that you get in the habit of using makefiles for compiling your Java application code. More information on makefiles is available here.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Running a Java application</span></p>
<p>Once you have successfully compiled your Java source code, you can invoke the Java VM to run your application’s byte-code:<br>
% java  [, …]<br>
For example, to run the main method from the Foo class:<br>
% java Foo<br>
Any command line arguments (arguments to Foo’s main method) follow the class name:<br>
% java Foo 10 20</p>

<p>Sadly my computer that would have run any program without flaw… had a massive failure in the HDD (best case scenario) and I simply couldn’t afford to fix it at this time I’m stuck with a bare minimum windows xp that can’t run youtube without issue I’m very limited on my resources… So I agree with the “YEAY!”</p>
