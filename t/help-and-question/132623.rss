    <description>Alright first I wanna know how I can get double hits with DDS special using Palidino&#39;s 98% Special Attack Tut.

2nd, I need help with my server, I somehow messed up the dying function. When my character dies to NPCs he stays there with 0HP and loses 0 items. Also the server kinda freezes up and you can&#39;t click anywhere. I haven&#39;t yet tried this dying to another player. So yeah :S, if you can help please post so. Thanks.
