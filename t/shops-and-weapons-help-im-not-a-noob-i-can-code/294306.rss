    <description>Ok first off, I&#39;m not retarded.. I&#39;m not gonna come in Moparscape forums, and ask a dumb ass questions.. like &quot;HOW TO I MOVE AN NPC?! AMG!!SHIFT+1!!!&quot; But, I just need help with 2 things.. Small things.. Hopefully. I need to change the sellback price of an item.. Don&#39;t say in your shops.cfg, or items.cfg, because I&#39;m pretty sure thats not it.. And if it really is, can you take a pic of exactally which spot it would be for the sellback? I don&#39;t want a pic of the whole item line, I wanna know which spot would be the sellback price, and where I locate it.. The other thing is, knives.. I posted a thread about this like a month ago and no1 answered it.. like 30 views, but no answers.. thanks.. I just wanna add knives, how do I go upon doing this.. Thanks everyone.. Please help meh.. pl0x..</description>
