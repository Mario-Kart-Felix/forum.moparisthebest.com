    <title>317 to 508?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-to-508/266239</link>
    <description>Ok so i&#39;ve decided to make a new server from scratch.  I chose the pimpscape source the 317 version no silabs no nothing basically.  I was wondering if there was a way where i could convert it into later sources or clients.  Like bring my 317 to 377.  Then from 377 to 474. Then from 474 to 503.  Then 503 to 508 or something.  If there is no possible way of doing so please tell me.  I was reading a post by ry who managed to do that.  Do i even have to touch a thing for the source?  or does it depend on the client i use.  Right now im using the 503 HD client cuz i want hd.  I know how to set the client up but not the source part.  So please help me.  Thank YOU.</description>

              <p>I am pretty sure Pimp-scape is 317. There is no way to make a 317 a 508 unless you completely recode it onto a 508(so no Copy &amp; Paste or random number u change to make it a 508) and you will not b able to use a 508 client with a 317 server. They are 2 very different things</p>
