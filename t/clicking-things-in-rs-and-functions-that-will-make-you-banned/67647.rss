    <title>Clicking things in rs and functions that will make you banned</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/clicking-things-in-rs-and-functions-that-will-make-you-banned/67647</link>
    <description>I read through a tutorial from villu-reborn. Now I&#39;m wondering how to make it click within a certain area in runescape. You can&#39;t use x,y because the runescape client could be minimized, maximized, different resolutions, etc. etc. so how would you make it, for example, click on the inventory?


Also, what functions will get you banned? I think I read somewhere that sendkeys will get you banned. Are there any others?</description>

              <p>Uhh Bobby, In your script you have made a couple of mistakes. May i suggest on taking more SCAR lessons.<br>
Here is the fixed part of the script.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">procedure bobbyantibantalk(talk: string);
begin
wait(880+random(1000))
sendkeys(talk)
wait(1000)
end;</code></pre>
<p>Your one did not have the wait in line 7. Did not have a begin in line 4 and a semicolon was expected in script on line 3.</p>

<p>But you still shouldn’t use coordinates because it’s pretty detecable if “you” click at exatcly same place everytime.</p>

<p>How about use bitmaps or the FindColor function (Maybe use FindColor but there is a heap of the same colours used in Runescape), but you should really use bitmaps.</p>
<hr>
<p>Yes, Sendkeys will get you banned because it sends all of the keys at once. So you need to do some human like auto typing.</p>
<p>For example you can use the sleep function:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Program</span> HumanLike_AutoTyping;</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Procedure</span> SendKeys_More_HumanLike;    //Procedure name to start the script<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Begin</span><br>
SendKeys(‘Sending keys more human like’);       //Will type the sentence using the sleep function.<br>
Sleep(50 +Random(59));                               //Will send each key slowly<br>
Wait(1000)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">end;</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">begin</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">repeat</span><br>
SendKeys_More_HumanLike;                       //Procedure name in main line.<br>
[b]Until<a>/b</a><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">end.</span>                                               //End the entire script.</p>
<p>That script above will send the text more human like. You can copy and paste it into SCAR and test it!<br>
Anyways, i don’t really use autotypers.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">NOTE: Pretty sure the script will work, not tested</span></p>
