    <description>Hey server developers! :D

I recently started up RSCN(rscheatnet) Have recently re-opened. With some of the orignal cheating staff from rscn and rs2c.  We are looking for many ways to improve the site and offer you the best possible service as we can.  
  Im looking for a good private server to host on my server and offer you a webclient and some forums on our forum (your will have full moderator powers) We have 8 servers atm, so its proberly going to be run on its very own server. 
 
So you want a real 24/7/365 server? Link me to your thread so i can veiw it, and then ill be in touch :)</description>
