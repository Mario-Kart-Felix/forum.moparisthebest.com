    <title>Getting the 194 client started up</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-the-194-client-started-up/292145</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to get a RS 194 server started (from scratch) or at least the client working.

I&#39;ve downloaded the client and cache and put the cache files in a &quot;.file_store_32&quot; folder but all I get when trying to run is &quot;Error loading - retrying in 5 secs.&quot;

I&#39;ve decompiled the client and looked in signlink.java and AFAIK it&#39;s looking in the right place for the cache.

I realize this post sounds sort of noobish but I do have knowledge of Java and what&#39;s going on.

Can someone help me?
