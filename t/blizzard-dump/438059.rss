    <title>Blizzard Dump</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/blizzard-dump/438059</link>
    <description>I am looking into dumping the content from previous blizzard games (warcraft III, starcraft etc etc) 

I was wondering where exactly is the media stored on the computer/cd and has anyone ever tinkered with these things?


I came across this website : http://www.spriters-resource.com/pc_computer/starcraft/index.html
However, it is not what I need.

If anyone has any free time, help me google.</description>
