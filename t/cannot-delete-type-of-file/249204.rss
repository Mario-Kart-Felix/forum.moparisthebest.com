    <title>Cannot delete type of file</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cannot-delete-type-of-file/249204</link>
    <description>In my server characters folder, I found some files that are not class, java, cfg, txt, anything. They are named &#39;File&#39;, are 0 bytes, and when I delete them it says:

Cannot delete file: Cannot read from the source file or disk.

I have tried renaming it, a bat file, etc, but nothing works since I don&#39;t know what type of file it is. Any help?

I am sorry if this is the wrong section, but it does have to do with my server because it is driving me insane.

-Thanks in return.</description>
