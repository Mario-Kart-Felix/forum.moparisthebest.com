    <title>Vote4Cash System [317 Delta]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vote4cash-system-317-delta/380150</link>
    <description>Hey thanks for visiting to try and help me, if this interests you then ill do a deal, i can pay you like $5 or you can have admin on my VPS hosted server if you help me fix this which i think could get possible very popular seeing as all dupes are fixed and last time i put this server online WITH dupes it got 150+ players, because this wont take very long.

What my problem is ... i cant get MYSQL to work on the server side for Vote4Cash, i got the website side working :), i made it so when you vote it sends it to a database on my website. if you need to check my website side out, then this is the download for my working vote4cash website http://www.mediafire.com/?884dn5zfvpyc78v

The errors that i am getting are VERY complicated and if i posted them on here then it would be almost impossible to configure it to work :( so i have a better idea, i put the com folder with all the mysql files ETC in a zip file along with the source and the MYSQL.java file that i made, could you please configure MYSQL to work and add something like the code below to the login method so when they login it gives them like 2m. some of the commands below MIGHT not work like checkslots because the variable is wrong, but if you could get the MYSQL parts working then that would be fantastic, Thanks Viality

 if(MYSQL.checkVotes(playerName)){ if(freeSlots() &gt; 2){ if(MYSQL.voteGiven(playerName)){addItem(995,5000000);sM(&quot;Thank you for voting!&quot;);} }else{ sM(&quot;You do not have enough free space to receive items&quot;);}}

Download link for my source and com folder and MYSQL.java here : http://www.mediafire.com/?guyydkexudofd1v 

Once your finished with the server and its working could you please zip it and send it and upload it to like mediafire then send the link to my email or reply on this post with the link, i will then give you the reward of your choice.
