    <description>This board is for all programming languages in general. Post your programs you&#39;ve made here or help someone else. Tutorials are fine.

We should strain that this board is only for &quot;proper&quot; (c,c++,c#,java etc etc) programming languages therefore applications made with the aid of another application and scripts is not programming. For example, a game written in java using a pre-made engine is acceptable while making a game with rpg maker isn&#39;t.
