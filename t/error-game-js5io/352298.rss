    <description>Ok, i ripped my 614 loaders and dumped some info from my 614 to my 508, and it let me online once. after i messed around with some dungeoneering crap and went to eat lunch, i log off. when i tried loading my server and client, it said &quot;error_game_js5io&quot;. I don&#39;t understand? It worked perfectly 20min ago before i closed it, and now it&#39;s stuck at connecting to server, and  get this error.

Anyone might know what to do?

And my server says:

Connection received from 127.0.0.1

Spammed about 40 times...

Tried again:

Now it says: error_game_js5connect_outofdate</description>
