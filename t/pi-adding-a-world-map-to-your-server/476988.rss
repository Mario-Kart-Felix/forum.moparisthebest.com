    <title>[PI] Adding a world map to your server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-adding-a-world-map-to-your-server/476988</link>
    <description>Hello fellow Moparscapers, today I am going to be teaching you how to add fully working, full functional maps to your server.

Here is some media

[img]http://puu.sh/1GYzR[/img]

Okay, so before we get started, I would like to say I am not the creator of the application, however I did create a jar and a batch file for you. I do not know who made it as I ripped it from an old 317 cache I had lying around. Full credits to the creator for the application. I also spent a reasonable amount of time researching to see if I could find the creator.

This map launches another java application, so it&#39;s like a little pop up.

Lets get in to it

Create a new windows batch file and name it whatever you like.

Insert this code in to it

[code]
@echo off
title Map
cd C:\mycache\WorldMap
START javaw -jar WorldMap.jar
exit
[/code]

Now, the 

[code]cd C:\mycache\WorldMap[/code]

Means cd (Change directory) to c:\mycache\worldmap

You will need to locate to your cache, for example

[code]cd c:\users\you\insidiaxcache\worldmap[/code]

Now we will move on to the actual application.

Download the application from

http://uppit.com/ctb9ise95dmo/WorldMap.rar

Then, extract the contents of the folder into your cache folder,so extract it into for example

insidiaxcache

not insidiaxcache/sprites etc

Now you are done, when the batch file you created or the application is run, the world map will launch.

Enjoy.</description>

              <p>So you just took a world map and put it here? Also this would be ‘Adding a world map to your client’ assuming you’d want to put it in your client. This isn’t JUST for PI. It would work for non-renamed clients, too… It would work with anything at all because it’s not programmed into anything.</p>

              <p>Hello fellow Moparscapers, today I am going to be teaching you how to add fully working, full functional maps to your server.</p>
<p>Here is some media</p>
<p><img src="http://puu.sh/1GYzR" alt width="627" height="494"></p>
<p><img src="http://puu.sh/1GYAY" alt width="632" height="493"></p>

<p>Okay, so before we get started, I would like to say I am not the creator of the application, however I did create a jar and a batch file for you. I do not know who made it as I ripped it from an old 317 cache I had lying around. Full credits to the creator for the application. I also spent a reasonable amount of time researching to see if I could find the creator.</p>
<p>This map launches another java application, so it’s like a little pop up.</p>
<p>Lets get in to it</p>
<p>Create a new windows batch file and name it whatever you like.</p>
<p>Insert this code in to it</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">@echo off
title Map
cd C:\mycache\WorldMap
START javaw -jar WorldMap.jar
exit</code></pre>
<p>Now, the</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Means cd (Change directory) to c:\mycache\worldmap</p>
<p>You will need to locate to your cache, for example</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Now we will move on to the actual application.</p>
<p>Download the application from</p>
<p><a href="http://uppit.com/ctb9ise95dmo/WorldMap.rar" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://uppit.com/ctb9ise95dmo/WorldMap.rar</a></p>
<p>Then, extract the contents of the folder into your cache folder,so extract it into for example</p>
<p>insidiaxcache</p>
<p>not insidiaxcache/sprites etc</p>
<p>Now you are done, when the batch file you created or the application is run, the world map will launch.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
