    <title>Open RSCD renewal</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/open-rscd-renewal/278107</link>
    <description>[s]I have come to the most logical conclusion that DARScape Classic must now become an open source development project.

I have always believed in the quality service demonstrated by the staff to be what makes or breaks a private server. What we &quot;have&quot; specifically should not be of a loss by releasing what we have developed to the rest of the community.

I began Open RSCDv25 several months ago only to find my work go un-aided by the rest of the RSC developers. While I understood that the majority of users did not want to go the distance to install a MySQL based server, I also discovered the additional time it took to keep it updated with each successive update of DARScape was too time consuming. That is now no longer a problem and I believe it is absolutely necessary to keep our source open to the public so that the following occurs:

1.) More developers to be attracted to development of stable, interesting server sources
2.) Support the continued interest in RSC development
3.) Nullify the reason to DDoS other servers to try to shutdown the competition

I will be releasing everything we have developed minus our player data, IPB forum, (licensed software, a replacement forum must be supplied by user) and webclient. In the coming weeks this will be made public.[/s]

Second thought, never mind.</description>

              <p>I understand where your coming from but your missing the picture here. The type of developer your looking for to help with the project, is the type of developer that can do everything themselves, and does not need anyones help, not yours and not other peoples. That is why they won’t bother with this. Almost all of the more challenging aspects of a RuneScape Classic private server has already been accomplished in RSCD, there’s really only little things left.</p>
<p>Nobody that can provide stable and great updates will bother with this, simply because they can do this entire project them selves.</p>
<p>For example, i don’t know how much this Darscape differs from RSCD, i’ll take a guess and say barely any, maybe half an hour of work to the type of developer your looking for.</p>
<p>But overall something like this does exist, the RSCA/DQ community’s developers are quite active and social together, we help each other out when needed and we all get along. The type of developer your looking for, the RSCA/DQ team have a handful of them, and i guess this is the same reason i think that the idea your suggesting is going to go nowhere.</p>
<p>80%+ of the active developers of the RuneScape Classic community that i know of, socialize around <span class="hashtag">#rscdev</span> and <span class="hashtag">#rsca</span>.dev channels on securitychat. (mainly <span class="hashtag">#rsca</span>.dev since it’s private) whilst <span class="hashtag">#rscdev</span> seems to get a lot of questions from newcomers, and very lightweight development due to it being public.</p>
<p>I think its great that your trying to get a group of people to help develop it, but from what it sounds like i don’t think you’ll get any developers your looking for, from the crowed your aiming at.</p>
