<p>Yes, it will be the same as your source.</p>

<li>
<p>Only the Head Icons, you have to have working prayer on your server for it to work fully.</p>

<li>
<p>Depends on if the client supports those items.</p>

<p>No, it’s not.</p>

              <p>If the client is an open source the source will be the same, and no you will not have to ‘re-code’ anything.<br>
And you can use Prayer aginst someone that is not on the client. As long as the source has the client will have  it.</p>
