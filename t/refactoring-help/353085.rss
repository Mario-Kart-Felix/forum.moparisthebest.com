    <title>Refactoring help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/refactoring-help/353085</link>
    <description>Hi there, im studying/learning how the rsc client and server works,
and i&#39;ve been going through an older client just doing some refactoring,

okay, I have gameImage,
and I have gameImage.cdd, example: gameImage.cdd(l, i1, j1, k1, k2, l2, 0, 0, false);
so I realise gameImage goes back to &#39;class k&#39; which extends &#39;j&#39;,
so I go to &#39;class j&#39; and find,

public void cdd(int i, int k, int l, int i1, int j1, int k1, int l1, 
            int i2, boolean flag)


which contains a bunch of maths,
I get that it&#39;s easier to refactor stuff that has text in it to identify what it is,
but how are you supposed to know what this does?

Sorry if im off track im really new to this.

cheers

EDIT:

Oh I see,
           System.out.println(&quot;error in sprite clipping routine&quot;);
it has the error&#39;s under each, is this the only way to identify?

EDIT 2:
  no, there isn&#39;t errors for each an alot are the same errors, =\</description>

<p>Good luck running the pony show. I’m serious too.</p>
<p>RSC dev died and will remain dead regardless of who comes, 95% of the people you are trying to “help” are lost causes. Do what everyone else did and keep to yourself, why else do you think we have turned it into a “discussion” section now?</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span>: You need to take into account, that not everything that was de-obfuscated was turned back into simple english, so analyzing any of the code will require you to understand math algorithms at an “some-what” advanced level. Advice is to look at what you know/understand (code wise), and work your way from there. Plus, wasn’t the “gameImage” class involving assembling shapes/boxes to draw menu items?</p>

              <p>Its GameImage file and obviously its handleing client side images, spirits. Code is obfuscated so its hard to say while reading real rsc client source but you could compare it with private servers client source its basicly same.</p>

              <p>Hi there, im studying/learning how the rsc client and server works,<br>
and i’ve been going through an older client just doing some refactoring,</p>
<p>okay, I have gameImage,<br>
and I have gameImage.cdd, example: gameImage.cdd(l, i1, j1, k1, k2, l2, 0, 0, false);<br>
so I realise gameImage goes back to ‘class k’ which extends ‘j’,<br>
so I go to ‘class j’ and find,</p>
<p>public void cdd(int i, int k, int l, int i1, int j1, int k1, int l1,<br>
int i2, boolean flag)</p>
<p>which contains a bunch of maths,<br>
I get that it’s easier to refactor stuff that has text in it to identify what it is,<br>
but how are you supposed to know what this does?</p>
<p>Sorry if im off track im really new to this.</p>
<p>cheers</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Oh I see,<br>
System.out.println(“error in sprite clipping routine”);<br>
it has the error’s under each, is this the only way to identify?</p>
<p>EDIT 2:<br>
no, there isn’t errors for each an alot are the same errors, =\</p>
