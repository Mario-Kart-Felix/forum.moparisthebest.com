    <title>Don&#39;t have a clue on how to even start this [317]</title>

    <description>I&#39;m not a noob, but I&#39;m very confused on this, I don&#39;t even know where to start.

My players can follow each other through walls, and auto-retaliate attacks monsters in the water if they&#39;re ranging/maging and then they get stuck. I was wondering how I can fix this, It&#39;s really an annoyance to my server.</description>
