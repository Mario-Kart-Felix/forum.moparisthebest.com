    <title>Why is this happening</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-is-this-happening/112926</link>
    <description>I am following the tutorials VERY carefully, doing EXACTLY as they tell me, when I save, Compile, and restart my server, nothing is edited, it&#39;s the same old Satan&#39;s Isle.
I mean, I changed some Armor&#39;s stats, nicely edited some shops, moved a couple of things around..
But now I can&#39;t do anything.
I tried making the XP higher when you train. Didn&#39;t happen.
I tried making it say &quot;Anon has logged in, BOW TO HIS FEET!&quot;
Didn&#39;t happen.
You know what? FUCK IT.
I&#39;ll just.. give my edited Satan&#39;s Isle to some random guy.. It really isn&#39;t that bad.
I can&#39;t edit shit, so I am just wasting days of my life on this stupid server which I won&#39;t even end up running 3 hours before something fatal happens to the server and my week of editing is fucked.
There HAS to be some way..
Unless it&#39;s my compiler.. Maybe it&#39;s not doing it&#39;s job?
I&#39;ll try editing it, and adding Mod Taharok&#39;s perfect compiler..

Get back to me.</description>
