    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/barrage-help/261329</link>
    <description>i need some help with a code. NOTE: I AM USING A DELTASCAPE BASED SOURCE.

Im not exactly sure how this would work but..

i was wondering if there was a way to make it so if you are frozen (barraged, etc.) that it will remove the choice to follow or attack


i was think something like:

[code]if frozen == true; 
then [/code] 
...a coding that removes the attack and follow option.


and i am stuck there, i am not that good of a coder so im going to need some help finishing it.  I WILL GIVE YOU CREDIT FOR HELPING ME.</description>
