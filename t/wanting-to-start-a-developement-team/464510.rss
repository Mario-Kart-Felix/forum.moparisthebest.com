    <description>[center]Hello, my name is Tehpk. I am looking to start a developement team. I have been coding for some time now, and i would like to start a developement team for a server that could potentionally get over 1k players. I have a Quad Core 6G of ram vps online 24/7, I have Resources Including Funding for the project, Will have a .com/.net/.org Domain, Would like to have a webclient. The funding will Include Advertising the server to the extreme, and giving the developement team the ability to earn some real life cash, through paypal. If anyone is interested, please post here or send me a message. Please have some good 317+ coding experience. Thanks.

              <p>As I suspected. This isn’t directed at you, but servers like SS and such are just some guys with a lot of starting money, who most likely bought a source, and a top-of-the-line VPS, and have payed for a lot of content to get added, and then hosted.</p>

<p>You kinda just proved Tyb’s point. But then again I involve myself with RSPS’s now, not to play, but to program/code the, etc. If you are really serious about this project then I may consider being a part of it…If you have a good source to start with as well.</p>
