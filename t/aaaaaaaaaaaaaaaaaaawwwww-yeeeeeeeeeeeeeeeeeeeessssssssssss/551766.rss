    <description>I&#39;m a MAJOR fan of the entire Castlevania series which, unfortunately, have failed to deliver the same quality of games as they used to.
I started playing Symphony of the Night when I was around 8 and I couldn&#39;t drop the game for anything longer than a month; I&#39;ve played it on the PS1, ported to my cracked PSP and played the unlockable version on the official PSP game and I still find secrets I didn&#39;t know back then.

Now, after all these years, my friend comes up to me and shows me this:
