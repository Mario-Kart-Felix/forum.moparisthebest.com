    <description>Hi, im using a desktop with no integrated wireless card and using wired connection with a wireless router hooked up. i got a server(ddsspeced v2.5) and client(blank client) from downloads, and i set environment variable and downloaded java jdk update 26. i got no-ip host set up and downloaded the duc and checked it and made it online. turned off firewall for now to make sure it works. i can connect to my server on 127.0.0.1 but other people cant connect to my no-ip and its all on port 43594. i hvae a linksys router. if anyone can help me over msn or teamviewer that would be really good :)

edit: when i port forwarded ur supposed to use ur ipv4 adress and i did but in the no-ip duc when i open it, it says that the ip its using is like 217.214... like its different and my ipv4 is like 192.168.... so i think that could be the problem?</description>

              <p>not only do you have to port forward but your firewalls/anti virus/ spyware programs might be blocking the port so you might have to turn them off, google port check and use one of those to see if your port is open (if that says its open and you still cant connect) than you deff need to turn off one of the ones i side above</p>
