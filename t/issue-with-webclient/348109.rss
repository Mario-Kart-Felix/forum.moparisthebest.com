    <title>Issue with webclient</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/issue-with-webclient/348109</link>
    <description>Alright, well, i follwed Muroth&#39;s webclient tutorial. Everything went smoothly and worked perfectly up until i put the jar online.

whenever i run the webclient.jar from my desktop, it starts up and logs in without a hitch. The problem is when its being loaded online.
Everytime i try to load the applet that starts it i get this error:

without the cache downloaded it starts up and downloads the cache, after that itll give me that error, keep in mind that this online happens when i try to load it online through the applet.

Does anyone know what could be causing this error?</description>
