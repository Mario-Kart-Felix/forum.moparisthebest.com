    <description>~The Outer Banks V1.3~

I have recently developed my new server ~The Outer Banks V1.3~ and released it,

i have ran into a problem where I have not been able to set non-wildy areas in brimhaven Zenzie and i have been searching for a solution for 2 days--- Still no solution I have recently abandon the idea until i have started losing players due to them being pked while attacking dummies and hay bales and such.

Whoever can help me will be given 20% Credits- That is if you can help me set non-wildy areas on brimhaven or turn whole server into non-pk server with something to set some areas for pk!

Please help me i have lost over 20 players including co-owner.</description>
