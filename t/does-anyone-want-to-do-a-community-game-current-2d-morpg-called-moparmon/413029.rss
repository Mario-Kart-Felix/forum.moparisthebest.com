    <title>Does anyone want to do a community game? [Current: 2D MORPG called &#39;Moparmon&#39;]</title>

    <description>[s]This is another sort of &quot;survey&quot; being conducted to see the popularity of doing a community game. There are many elements that need be decided, including genre, game play, mechanics, etc. All the basic stuff behind a game. Naturally, this game will be 2D, as we are reluctant to release anything 3D at this point in time. This survey is, of course, connected to [url=http://gamedev.moparisthebest.com/smf]Mopar GameDev[/url].

Post in this topic if you will be able to contribute ideas, programming, or resources (graphics and sounds are very much needed, and are a lot harder to come by than code!) We need a collection of people working consistently together to get this to work. Frell, David, Spel, and I will be directing the project as it moves along. There will be a series of tutorials posted when the game is finished, and it will be run publicly so others can enjoy the work you all put into it. :)

Post if you like the idea and if you can help. If it gains enough popularity, this topic will move over to GameDev and we&#39;ll start from there. Thanks. :D[/s]

After settling on an idea, we now have an [url=http://gamedev.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,516408.0.html]official development progress[/url] topic. Head on over there and keep the ideas flowing! :)</description>

Haven’t been keeping up with the thread, but would it be multiplayer, like an MMO of pokemon, or just single player?<br>

So is the first M “massive” or “multiplayer”?  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

<p>People can create (rational, no penismon etc) moparmons, write descriptions for entry in the mopardex etc. People can sign up to make the complete sprite packs for certain towns, and have the town named what they want, hopefully enough people will make towns that we fill up the map.</p>

<p>That’s not a bad idea! Dynamically expanding map… They’ll have to be reviewed very closely before being approved though</p>
