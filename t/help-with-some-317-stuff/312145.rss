    <description>how can i make the farmer house in egdeville so only i can get inn and i have to unlock the door to the other players for them to get inn?
and its like a command like ::unlockthedoor4 [playername]?

and I got a few questions to :D

1. how can i make a pickup command for admin and mods? like mods can ONLY type ::pickup for mod stuff and same with admin ONLY admin stuff and owner is ok they can pickup everything?

2. how to make admin armour, mod armour and owner armour untradeable?

3. how to make so when staff die they dont loose theyr staff armour it comes up a writing ONLY if the staff has that item
&quot;your STAFF armour has been deleted&quot; and the armour piece has been deleted instead off dropped?

4. how can i make simple mystery events like (santa event) u talk to santa and u tele to a place and u talk to that guy and get something?</description>

<p>im not sure you could do that, but you could make an owner zone command to where it teles you there, and you could tele ppl there.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#1</span>. Make a custom command like ::modarmor and ::adminarmor? and just ::pickup for you.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#2</span>. idk how to make it untradeable but use this code to make it non weildable by other players.</p>

         if(args.length == 3) {
