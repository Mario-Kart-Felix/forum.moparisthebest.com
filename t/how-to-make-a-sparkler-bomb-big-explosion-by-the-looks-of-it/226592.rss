    <title>How to make a sparkler bomb (big explosion by the looks of it)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-a-sparkler-bomb-big-explosion-by-the-looks-of-it/226592</link>
    <description>What you need:

Few packs of sparklers (the ones from around bonfire night nov 5th)
Small bit of white plastic piping
2 ends for the white plastic piping
some kind of fuse... (preferably firework fuse or just make ure own)
Ducktape
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[b]Disclaimer: I am not responsible for anything that happens to you while you make or use this &quot;bomb&quot; As if you live in the uk you probably, If caught, be arrested at gunpoint or if you live in the us will probably be shot.[/b]

Method:
1) cut the handles of the sparklers.
2) cut the white plastic piping to the size of the sparklers.
3) put one of the caps on one end of the white plastic piping.
4) put as many sparklers as you can in the white plastic piping (if they dont fit snugly then wrap them up in abit of newspaper and put back in.
5) get another sparkler and attack the fuse on to it with tape and put it in the white plastic piping in the middle
6) get the second and last cap and put a hole big enough for the fuse in the middle and put it on the white plastic piping.
7) Finally wrap up in duck tape

You now have a sparkler bomb.

<p>But wouldn’t you have more of an effect if you stripped the sparkler and packed the dust into the PVC pipe? Dangerous yes but you can fit more “Sparkler dust” in. You could use a ice lolly stick to scrape the dust off.</p>

<p>Sparkler dust is better on copper piping[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 21, 2008, 02:20:07 pm[/size][hr]Also some other videos say use Coloured sparklers as gold ones burn slower where as coloured ones burn fast = bigger explosion</p>

              <p>Lolz, we made some really decent ones of these last year. You put like four packs of sparklers (like 10 a pack) into like a group with one sticking out the top. Then with insulation tape, wrap them really tightly, don’t leave any gaps (except for the part where the one sticks out the top).</p>
<p>Now shove the bottom into the ground a long distance from glass or a house. Light the tip (the one sticking out) and run off.</p>
<p>When the spark dissapears into the body of the bomb, you have about three seconds before it blows up.</p>
