    <title>[Game] LawGame Beta 1.0 [Text-Game]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/game-lawgame-beta-1-0-text-game/48183</link>
    <description>Well, I hope you guys like text games, because that&#39;s what LawGame is.
Also, you sort of have to be a fast reader since I use the report box.

There&#39;s not much in the game right now, but I&#39;m going to add forms soon so the game will be alot easier.
Also with the form I can make shops to buy stuff so the money you make in the game when you win a battle wont be useless. :P

Basic plot: You play as a Lawyer, sorta play, more like read, but that&#39;ll be changed soon! And you&#39;re against a Judge (will be selectable to be played soon). The object is: you want to beat him as many times as possible. So far the fighting system is completely random, but AGAIN, this all will be changed soon!

Basicaly, the current stage of development that the script is at is more of a base for the game. But you can still have a [size=7pt]tiny[/size] bit of fun with it.

I DO take suggestions for this game and feel free to modify the game and re-post it if you want.

Maybe I should make a version that you play as a hacker and you try to kill Andrew Gower and the rest of the Jagex team? :P

[b]Coming soon:[/b]

[ul][*]Forms for easy playing
[*]Item shop
[*]Saving system for those players who want to reach Match # 1,000,000[/ul]


P.S. If you&#39;re not a fast reader, then you can always just pause the script if you want to read something it sais, then resume it when you want to continue.

Note: The script is attached to this post.

Have fun,
~Dizzy  :D</description>

</aside>
<p>Lol, no thanks. The agility isn’t like the skill in RuneScape. But thanks for the suggestion, it just gave me a new idea. How 'bout when I make the shop, you can buy agility packs and potions.</p>
<p>Agility pack: Depending on the pack, your Agility skill will be raised. (e.g., 1-3 levels)<br>
Agility potion: Depending on the potion, your Agility skill will be raised for one match. Or Super &amp; Mega Agility potions, making it so you get up to 2-3 matches.</p>
<p>XxKanexX: I like your version, but I want the game to be almost endless. I like my fighting system already, all it needs is some tweaks though to fix the problem where the Judge would almost attack you non-stop without the player getting a turn. Which can be easily fixed by giving the Lawyer a higher Agility skill level when the game starts. I can still use your help, so keep those submissions comin’. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Oh and no one needs to worry about having to restart the game after winning like 100 rounds or so, because I’m going to add a little saving system soon.</p>

But if you REALLY want to win the Judge, then you can modify the script a bit to make your Agility Level really high <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Tutorial: How to cheat in the game to attack ALOT:</p>
<p>Go to Line 207 in the script and under</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">IsNewGame := false;</code></pre>
<p>ADD:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">PlayerAgility := 9999;</code></pre>
