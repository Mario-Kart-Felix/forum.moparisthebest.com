    <description>Basically, I&#39;ve been really interested in game development lately, so I figured I would try to get everyone&#39;s input on which route you would take. As you might know, there are tons of pre-built game engines out their, such as Unity, and you can do truly amazing things with this without having a ton of programming knowledge. Would you rather use an engine like Unity, or build your own game framework with the support of a graphical engine that works with your desired language?</description>

              <p>I’d agree more with object here. Unless you want to go through years of self-teaching, you can’t just write a game engine from the bottom up without SOME sort of reference (whether that be a book, other engines, engine devs, etc.) A game engine is among the most complex software in the programming industry, so it’s certainly no small feat to accomplish. Unless you already have extensive programming knowledge or are willing to go through the crazy amount of effort it takes to do it on your own, start smaller. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>If it’s a particular game you’re trying to create, you’re probably better off using some existing librar(y|ies) or framework(s). Unless you have created a library or framework for it yourself already, of course.</p>
<p>For me, however, it’s the framework that’s the most fun part to create. At least for now. I am creating my own engine. Including the 3D software renderer.</p>
<p>Even if you can hack together a working 3D software renderer quite fast, it takes a lot of time to get it right. You will want to be able to reuse all of its parts in other projects.</p>

              <p>Personally I’d start with some like Valve’s Source Engine and make a HL2 mod, or something along those lines. You have all the models and sounds that you’ll need to create a functioning game, unlike with your own game framework where you’ll have to gather all the models and stuff. Others will probably shoot this down and say that you should start from the bottom and all that, but whatever. Just my opinion.</p>
