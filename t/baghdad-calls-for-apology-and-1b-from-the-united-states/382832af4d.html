<p>EDIT: The “they’re brainwashed” argument doesn’t really hold any water with me. Firstly, for all I know that’s bullshit and they just <em>don’t agree with us</em>. Secondly, if they’re brainwashed, you change that by other ways than storming the country and taking it over. Thirdly, plenty of other countries are “brainwashed” too… what are you doing about North Korea, for example? Why the double standard?</p>

        <p>The ordinary citizens don’t understand that when they run out of oil their country is gone. So if we stabilize the country and help it actually develop an economy it will benefit the US and Iraq. But the terrorists don’t want this because of separation between church and state, which contradicts the teachings of Allah. So they will go to greater lengths (such as using their mouthpiece AlJ) to make people believe anything.</p>

<p>I have never given a motive for the war - because I don’t know what it was. None of the reasons pro-war people give ever make sense, and I can’t think of any others. I don’t believe its some big oil conspiracy.</p>
<p>I’m forced to settle for incompetence, because its not like I think the US is evil.</p>

You took that out of context. Quote the next two sentences with that.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Your</span> second part, you guys do this all the time. Ill bring up something and you act like it was the ONLY motive for the war. If you look at the causes of the war fragmented it will never make sense.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I have never given a motive for the war - because I don’t know what it was. None of the reasons pro-war people give ever make sense, and I can’t think of any others. I don’t believe its some big oil conspiracy.</p>
<p>I’m forced to settle for incompetence, because its not like I think the US is evil.</p>
<p>EDIT: You’re not doing a great job of arguing against “it doesn’t matter what the citizens think because I disagree with them” yet.[/quote]<br>
If you want 98% of the reason here you go (the other 2% will be suspected coalition secrets at the time):</p>

“people outside of the US”</p>
<p>Now, I’d like to address this first. I have a feeling you might think this is an anti-american lead attack on you, It isn’t. Many other countries are over there as part of the coalition forces, but from a British perspective, we had our Prime Minister up there with George Bush, making his speeches every step of the way, with them both combining together to try and help the image that it wasn’t just some random attack on a country, it had support behind it - for both sides.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Oddly enough, I dont consider the UK and Australia from being that far from the US, thats not who i was aiming at. I had just got done reading about Britain and the US being the main two coalition forces that felt an invasion was necessary due to the threat of wmds.</p>
<pre><code> Judging by your response it seems like you view the WMD's as the [i]only[/i] cause of the invasion, which it isnt. It played a big role, but it wasnt the only reason. The UK was with us during [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War]Operation Desert Storm[/url], when Saddam invaded Kuwait, so this very much explains why Britain backed our decision to invade Iraq. Many people forgot about this past after Saddam was out of power, and [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_of_Saddam_Hussein]sentenced to death by his own people[/url]. I personally think we all should have left after this, but how would it look if we all invaded and destroyed the place just to get Saddam out of power, and then left it like that? Staying there proved to have consequences, but leaving could have had greater consequences when the factions all struggled for power while the country had very weak defense, which may have resulted in [i]complete[/i] neglect for civilians.

<p>As to why I think they actually invaded the country? I know I said I couldn’t believe two countries with such military intelligence could have such a firm belief that there are WMDs capable of threatening the security of the US, UK or any of their allies, only to find out they were wrong. But maybe they did have the evidence or intelligence that they did have them, but it seems like it was greatly exaggerated to the public to justify the war.</p>

</aside>
<pre><code> Contrary to popular belief, we were never worried about the WMD's threatening the homeland, more so the fact that if Saddam actually used them it could have started another gulf war, which is the last thing we need. Id like to bring up Adolf Hitler in this part of the debate. When Hitler invaded Poland not many countries took action because they figured "Alright, we'll let him have it." But country after country invaded, no one other than the countries' own resistance took action. Next thing you know we had another World War. Had Saddam marched back into Kuwait more forcefully and used his [url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/7703/iraq.html]chemical and biological weapons[/url], a second Gulf War would have been certain. As many may know, or not, most of the [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_reserves]worlds oil supply comes from wells in the middle east[/url]. Saddam's aim in the [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Kuwait]invasion of Kuwait[/url] was to gain control of the oil wells/fields in that region after he accused (and quickly) attacked Kuwait for [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slant_drilling]slant drilling[/url]. After Desert Storm, Saddam [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwaiti_oil_fires]ordered his military to set fire to all the oil wells in Kuwait as they were leaving the country[/url]. Even with the wells just being set on fire, this resulted in an effect of oil prices worldwide. Imagine if they were destroyed.

<p>Id also like to add in that the UN inspectors did find varying evidence during the search, but most was dismissed as not credible: <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/gunning/etc/arsenal.html">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/gunning/etc/arsenal.html</a></p>

<p>That is a massive mistake. I know you’ve linked to findings of ‘WMDs’, but none that were of a threat to anyone outside of that country. I think if the war hadn’t turned out to be such a total buttfuck with little to no positive effect so far, people wouldn’t have been so annoyed by it, but the clear mistakes made leave people annoyed at not only the waste of money it had been, but the loss of soliders by the coalition fores and the mess they’ve left the country in.</p>

<pre><code> As ive stated above, the WMD's were not a threat to anyone in the US or UK, but easily could have been used on neighboring countries, like Iran, when [url=http://www.rense.com/general29/wesold.htm]we sold Saddam chemical and biological weapons[/url] during the [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwaiti_oil_fires]Iran-Iraq war[/url]. This was a very smart idea at the time, it was like killing two birds with one stone. Iraq was in a war against Iran, and we didn't want Iran attacking Israel. Saddam kept Iran busy, so we showed support for him. During this time [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_relations]Iran and Israel were not very fond of each other[/url]. And during this past decade Iran has shown more and more hostility towards Israel as it has [url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2009/12/16/iran-test-fires-longest-range-missile/]test fired long range missiles capable of hitting Israel[/url].

<p>[quote]Iran’s foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki declared that Israel was not capable of an attack and still recovering from the 2006 war in Lebanon.[44]<span class="bbcode-b"> The Iranian Chief of the Revolutionary Guards, Mohammad Ali Jafari said Israel was within the reach of Iranian missiles and Iran would close the Strait of Hormuz, cutting off two-fifths of the global oil supply.[44] Iran has the capability to close the Strait of Hormuz or impede traffic for a month or more, and any U.S. attempts to reopen it could escalate the conflict.</span> [55]</p>
<p>According to Mohammad Ali Jafari “If Israel military agresses against sovereignty and independence of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the country will use its right, established under international law which inevocably establishes the right to defend its sovereignty by all lawful means available to it. Moreover, if such aggression is penetrated, the United Nations will be obliged to repulse such an aggression towards its sovereign member”[52].</p>
<p>On 7 February 2010, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the destruction of Israel was assured. According to the Teheran Times, Khamenei told Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader Ramadan Abdullah Shallah, “Israel is going downhill toward decline and fall and God willing its obliteration is certain”. Khamenei went on to call Israel “a symbol of atrocity, viciousness, and ugliness,” and said the West’s “support for the Zionist regime is ineffective.”[56]</p>
<p>Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s chief of staff, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, said that if <span class="bbcode-b">Israel attacked Iran it would be destroyed within a week.</span>[57][/quote]</p>

<p>In November 2003 a Scottish newspaper claimed that Israel “warned that it is prepared to take unilateral military action against Iran if the international community fails to stop any development of nuclear weapons at the country’s atomic energy facilities”.[37] It cited Israeli defence minister Shaul Mofaz stating, “under no circumstances would Israel be able to tolerate nuclear weapons in Iranian possession”. In December 2005, a British newspaper claimed that the Israeli military had been ordered by then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to plan for possible strikes on uranium enrichment sites in Iran in March 2006, based on Israeli intelligence estimates that Iran would be able to build nuclear weapons in two to four years.</p>

<p>As you can see, they do not like each other (obviously). To add onto my first reply about Saddam and the possibility of starting a second gulf war, this Iran and Israel conflict wasn’t as intense during the first Gulf War. Had a second one started, Iran could possibly take its chance to finally attack Israel and escalate the would-be conflict in the middle east.</p>

<p>I know, it wasn’t great before, Saddam needed taking out of power, and that could have been done, the US and its allies could have helped with that, it didn’t justify the total fuckover.

<pre><code> Two of the main reasons we invaded Iraq were due to Saddams rule, and the threat of WMD's. The other reason required an invasion due to our other target - Al Qaeda. Because of the Al Qaeda presence in Iraq (now mostly in Afghanistan) an invasion was necessary to try to remove Al Qaeda forces from Iraq. Another player in this ballgame was the suspected linking between [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein_and_al-Qaeda_link_allegations]Saddam and Al Qaeda[/url], in that he may have been funding the organizations.

<p>As to the third one, I dont see why Saddam gassed an entire town and not just the forces ‘revolting’. The majority of the deaths from the gassing were civilians and in a case like a mass gassing i would call that complete negligence. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halabja_poison_gas_attack">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halabja_poison_gas_attack</a>. Unless you were talking about the act of genocide by Saddam in 1986.</p>
<p>America has been policing the middle east since the end of World War 2. The middle east is practically a mess between Iraq, Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Israel and all their religious wars and fights for oil and land. Iran is ready to nuke Israel (Iran is in the process of making them), Israel is ready to nuke Iran (And they have them). Israel is treating this as a preemptive war, Iran IIRC blames Israel for all their problems and for some reason wants to get rid of Israel. Iraq, Iran, and Syria and Pakistan have always had conflicts.[/quote]</p>
