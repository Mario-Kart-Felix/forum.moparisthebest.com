MEDIAFIRE: [URL=http://&quot;http://www.mediafire.com/download/3nefl0wqm8ifq6w/ZDR_Client_v1.rar&quot;]http://www.mediafire.com/download/3nefl0wqm8ifq6w/ZDR_Client_v1.rar[/URL]



[I](Please note the server was hosted without making final tweaks to the game, you could say that we&#39;re in &quot;beta&quot;. That being said there will be NO resets, merely rolling updates to the current game. Hope you all enjoy!)[/I]

[SIZE=3][B]ZdiddyReloaded was one of the prime PK servers back in 2008. After endless searching, I was kindly given the source files with permission to host. I bring you, ZDR V2.[/B] (I take no credit for the server whatsoever, I am merely the person paying for the hosting, and making tweaks every now and again).

I have not made many changes to the source, merely a few shop tweaks, some teleport edits and changing of some item values. That is all. 

This server offered it&#39;s players endless hours of fun. It was filled with a community of the best runescapers you would likely find anywhere. The players loved it, no matter how rugged it was. After many years of ZDR being confined to the memory of those that were lucky enough to experience it... I have managed to bring it back. 


The server is primarily a PK based economy. Players start with nothing but a Rune Pickaxe and a Power amulet. To earn your first significant sum of gold, you must steal gold from the stalls. The leveling is fast and reward satisfying. You will make your first million here. Continuing from there, you will likely go and hone your skills in one of the many training areas in any of the skill you choose... Although I advise slayer ;).

There are Minigames for you to partake in such as a custom GodWars - please see the pictures below for more info - and multi-Jad amongst others. 

These are all preludes to the main event. To make real money, and to experience the server in it&#39;s rawest... You must PK.

There are many PK areas, notably Mage Bank and Edgeville. Here you will fight to kill your opponent, loot his items and wave goodbye to his bank. 

Forgive me for I am not the best with words nor do I have the abilities akin to a salesmen. All I can do is ask that you try the server, for I am sure that once you have played it you will fall in love with it like all of the old players of ZDR, many of whom still wander these forums.

I have attached screen shots I have hastily taken today, all in haste so I can get the server up and running as soon as possible!
