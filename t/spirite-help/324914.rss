    <description>Ya, I hate custom spirits, but the other ones were plain out...Retarded, so I was going threw, and I wanted to have the original 3 buttons. Public, Trade, and Report Abuse. So I went and found the tutorial and un-Did everything, and Re-Coded it with what should have been the correct thing. now, when I re-added in the Spirit for it, it came out as this.

As much as I hate customs, can anyone help me on how to fix this.

Don&#39;t post &quot;Fix your spirits&quot; Because this is the correct Spirit size.</description>
