    <description>Are the only reason I log in recently. Hadn&#39;t logged in for a while before this update, but this is fun. It&#39;s not grindy and only takes like 5-10 minutes at a time. I love this sort of stuff. Haven&#39;t failed a single voyage yet, and while I usually only get 3-4 rounds off per day (of 2 ships, so 6-8 voyages), it&#39;s still fun. Can&#39;t wait to see some of the high tier gear.</description>

<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>OT: It’s a great update. The further you go, the more islands you can unlock. One you unlock the Skull region, you have a chance of getting scrolls for the armors/food that you can make. The armors are better than the Nex armors and the food is the best food currently in RuneScape. I think Jagex is trying to lower the price of the Nex armors so more people can afford it by releasing better armor.</p>
