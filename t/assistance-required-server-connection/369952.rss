    <title>Assistance required--Server connection!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/assistance-required-server-connection/369952</link>
    <description>I have just completed the portforwarding section, Opened up No-Ip, checked hosts off, ran the Server, and I searched the website I was suppost to have set up via no-ip, and I searched my website, and every time I do, there is a connection Error, and I&#39;m not even sure it works, could someone check out *, and tell me what they see, or provide a solution, as I have a feeling I&#39;m missing a vital detail. Much appreciated for any input whatsoever (:.</description>

              <p>Well, thanks for the tip, but I feel there is something they did not put in the Tutorial, like maybe allowing a program through a firewall, or such. Is there anything specific I have to do, besides set up my port, and turn on DUC, and the server?</p>
