    <title>Fifa 08</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fifa-08/195116</link>
    <description>I have liked the Fifa games since around 02 but stopped playing them after the 06 version, probably because i was not really interested in console games because the ps2 was so outdated and did not really play on my 360 since i was waiting for the ps3 :P. 

Anyway Fifa 08 is the best fifa game (which it should be anyway, although there has been earlier versions of games which have been better than their updates) even the loading screen is impressive which gives you the chance to practice your shots at a goal, maybe this is just to distract from the slightly longer loading times than the older versions? although they are not massively long they are still longer than a few other games. The new camera modes are great improvement with me loving the &#39;Pro&#39; one.

So if anyone wants a match anytime pm me for my PSN :)

PS: Yeah i have noticed i am posting in this section quite a bit at the moment, i guess i&#39;m bored and don&#39;t mind posting very brief opinions/reviews on games :P</description>
