Maybe try this? It had bugs in its early release but from what I can see 99.9% of them are now fixed.</description>

              <p>I don’t think letting people xray to find ores is that much of an issue. It is unfair, but it’s not like duping and still takes time etc. It would be nice to stop it, but we’d need to start a new map and keep the seed private this time. We’d also have to use the plugin to hide ores, and all the block updates probably wont help performance. Also, inb4 someone writes a script to get the seed based on visible blocks.</p>
<p>However, xraying to find buried chests is totally unfair and if we wanted to prevent this we wouldn’t have an issue with map seeds and unnecessary block updates. It might be a good idea to install this plugin and set it up to just hide chests.</p>

If it lets you download the area, and the server sends a stone block instead of a chest (when appropriately covered) it won’t do you any good lol.[/quote]<br>
Sure but he could still find the ores and I think that’s the main discussion here?</p>
