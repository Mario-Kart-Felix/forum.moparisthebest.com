    <title>Need suggestions on life</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-suggestions-on-life/444270</link>
    <description>So, I&#39;ve come to a point in my life where none of the games that I have, nor none of the games that I&#39;m aware of, interest me in any way. I&#39;ve done Diablo 3, SWTOR, WoW, RS, LoL, Starcraft, and I&#39;m not a fan of shooters. Minecraft is only holding me minmally by myself, and not at all on multiplayer. I&#39;ve hit a programming block, and my job is menial (warehouse work mostly). I&#39;m looking to change my job at the very least to something involving programming, but until I finish school, it&#39;s going to be tough.

I don&#39;t know how to hunt, and my aim is awful. I&#39;m not a fighter, or a survivalist; but if it weren&#39;t for my worldly obligations (school loans, etc) I would leave and explore the world. I may be depressed, but I have medication that I plan on taking soon to see if there&#39;s a behavioral difference, but I don&#39;t expect one.

The problem I think is that I have everything that I could need. I&#39;ve got a family that loves me, a desktop, laptop, the start of a second desktop, game consoles, a car, etc. I have all of the things that people strive for, and yet I feel empty as I always have. Every year when people ask me what I want for my birthday or christmas, I tell them I want nothing because I truly do; not because I&#39;m being modest. And yet, I still feel empty. I&#39;ve never really been a religious man, and the only religions that I feel I could identify with are some of the more nature-based (shamanism, buddhism/taoism, etc).

So my question to you is this. What should I do?</description>

Garrysmod - fun as hell especially if you know some programming and logic, basically minecraft for older people (e2 (lua) is the ingame programming)<br>
Mount and blade warband - Medieval strategic first/third person combat game<br>
WoW - PVP</p>
<p>I burnout and repeat all of those</p>
<p>Of course I exercise and make sure games are my last priority after anything in real life, so im able to a have nonguilty look at my lifestyle.</p>

              <p>It seems like you feel lonely, I don’t know if you have any real friends, but having REAL friends and doing stuff with them really cheers me up when I feel what you feel. I also have everything (apart from a job :’(   ) I need, but just like you, I also get that depressed feeling. Having a girl that you love can also make you feel better. Practicing sports can also cheer you up. The only times I feel empty is when I’m just sitting in front of this laptop doing nothing.</p>
<p>I see depression as a biological reaction in my body, because at other times under the same circumstances, I can be really happy and cheered up, so I don’t really care about it and just think that it’ll go over soon.</p>

              <p>Honestly, my best advice is to just <span class="bbcode-b">feel</span> these emotions. That sounds dumb, but I’ll never forget when that bit of emotion got passed on; it’s helped a lot. Don’t over-exert yourself thinking how bad it is, how good it could be, how to fix it, how to not fix it, etc, just experience them. Keep a level head, and just remember, tomorrow is a new day.</p>
<p>Also, I’ve found when people say “what are you like that for? you don’t have a bad life at ALL.” seem to only make you feel worse. Good luck.</p>

<p>Secondly-I realized I was going through the same cycle as you as well(apart from the job). I was getting relentless with the cycle of life so I pretty much left it all behind and traveled. Over the past year I’ve traveled all over the world experiencing the culture and lives of many different people. I feel as if you can, really do this. My travels weren’t for volunteering or anything like that, but I met plenty of people who were there to help others and learn to value their own life. This opened my eyes and I’ve kind of formed a mentality of enjoying life and living every moment of it. If you can’t afford to travel, than a suggest meditation. Sometimes its great to just go outside at night and look at the world. For me, I’ll to to the beach and just walk when I can’t travel. The calmness of the night, sound of the waves, feeling of the breeze really makes you appreciate things. You may want to use some weed before, I’ve heard it helps.</p>
<p>So basically-If you’re not happy in life-than fucking change it. To see the world you must open your eyes first. YoL0caRpeDieMlOliTyPeLiKeBlACkP30pl3.</p>
<p>I’m in a meditation state right now. If this didn’t make any sense, sorry.[/quote]</p>
<p>I agree. Or the documentary, ‘A Map For Saturday’.</p>

              <p>Everyone i know is materialistic. And thats caused me to often be the outcast, because i dont care too much about ‘stuff’. I have been diagnosed with depression, and if i had no more ties to the world, i would probably kill myself. Not because im sad, but because theres nothing left. Ive often felt ‘numb’ to a lot if things that i shouldn’t. For example, i have never felt more feels than i did watching the second season finale of Dr. Who when Rose and the Doctor split up. Yet i was not phased by the deaths of either of my grandmothers recently. Not that im suppressing feelings of sadness, but that they simply arent there.</p>

              <p>Having a BSc and MSc in Computer Science, and a bachelor’s degree in psychiatry - I can tell that this seems to be a general case of depression. Go see a local psychiatrist and hopefully he/she will prescribe you some SSRI’s. Make sure you tell your doctor about the emptyness you feel, it seems that you’ve also been thinking about the purporse of life and if it’s worth living. Some SSRI’s cause you to become suicidal during the first few weeks - this would definitely happen to you.</p>

Don’t laugh because I’m being serious - watch My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. It’s an awesome cartoon and although it will seem very girly and bad at first, you’ll likely one day like it. <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,545338.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">I posted a topic on it</a> a while ago, and have gotten quite a few people into it.

[/quote]</p>
<p>I did. I watched both seasons. I’ve been watching Dr. Who recently, just finished season 2 (ohgodthefeels). Well, not the second season, but the second season of David Tennant being the Doctor.[/quote]Oh damn. Well, perhaps you’d like to pick up on another hobby. You only play modern games, but I know there’s some old games I’m sure you like. Try playing those (Like the GBC Zeldas, or the N64 Zeldas), or ROM hacking. ROM hacking is basically what got me started on my whole computer career thing, as it led to becoming more logical, getting smarter with computers, programming, etc…</p>
<p>I think your problem is you’re living for entertainment, not a challenge. Set goals for yourself. Certainly there’s plenty of work to be done to make games, or even writing a private server for RuneScape. I know you said you’ve gotten bored of programming, so try experimenting with new languages. Give C# a spin, or maybe try things you haven’t done in Java. Think about things you’ve wanted to do but haven’t/can’t.</p>
<p>Life is living in the bad and going for/looking forward to the better. You always have to keep yourself challenged or you’ll hit walls like these.</p>

<p>Exactly, I don’t have a hard life. I’m not upper class, I’m lower-middle class. There’s more to life than waking up, going to work, buying things we don’t need, with money we don’t have. We as a society have so detached ourselves from the world, and all of it’s wonders. But we’ve got to the point that we can’t remove ourselves from society, due to all of the obligations that are pushed upon us at such a young age.</p>
