    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/website-idea-thoughts/536598</link>
    <description>So i am planing on creating a website in which it is for people who passed away it would display a random memorial page for someone, also it will have a search bar so you can go to someone memorial page :) 

The memorial page would basically display:

Biography
B-day
Death day
Pictures
Timeline of person
etc

anyone can submit a memorial page and when its approved it will be displayed users will also have a option to randomize</description>

I see where ruby is coming from some people like there privacy and i guess some pictures and posts can make certain clicks in ones mind and cause people to be upset i thought it would be cool though like if everone had a personal wall and you could write there etc, i think its a good idea however if i do it what could be a good way to make it much safer like clearly i would need a really efficient report system…<br>
[/quote]This sort of thing certainly exists already so I don’t think there’s a fundamental problem with it. I guess the most important thing is that you carefully consider every feature you add, and make sure it wouldn’t have potential to offend anyone.[/quote]</p>
<p>What if everything uploaded had to be verified making information true, kind of like a verified checkmark on Twitter, Facebooke tc</p>

</aside>
<p>He would need to source where he got the information from. Some people can be real sensitive about it, and he would need some way of getting the posts taken down, if the family requests it to be removed. It is honestly better for people to just submit it, and he should have them agree to some sort of terms saying that they are a close friend or family. I know for instance in my family, they don’t want that sort of thing to be public news.</p>
<p>I like the idea of a site, but you would also need to somehow prove someone is dead.</p>
