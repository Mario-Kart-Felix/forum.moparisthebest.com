<p>If you’re starting off as a programmer, I would suggest learning the basics of Java first. RSPS are an ineffective way of learning the basics. What ends up happening is you get it all started, but don’t know what to do after that. So you start setting up your IDE, but something won’t work for one reason or another. You come here, ask for help, we tell you, and then it works again. Then you want to change the starting bonus for your server, so you ask how to do it. All you’re doing is learning how to change values without knowing what is actually happening. Not programming. Once you know how to program, you can solve nearly any problem without ever needing to ask here once you know how to program.</p>

<p>Okay thanks. What site would you recommend for me to start taking a look at to learn the basics?</p>
