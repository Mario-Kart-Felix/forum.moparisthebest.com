    <description> I&#39;ve been messing around with the RSCDv_25 source and the one thing i noticed was when you logout it keeps your loggedin value under rscd_players on 1 i know it would be simple to make it change to 0 on logout and i&#39;ve been trying for about an hour now but i suck with MYSQL commands and i can&#39;t figure out the exact file that i would even want to put it in.....Any help would be appreciated

FIXED IT!!!!

For anyone else trying to fix this minor problem i&#39;ll make a thread about it</description>

              <p>it’s a problem in all rscd_v25 sources i’m pretty sure…in the rscd_players table the ‘loggedin’ row stays at 1 even though you logout when it should change to 0 showing that they are logged out so then on the rscdlist in the index php it shows on my forum that everyone that had logged on is still online even though they are offline…</p>
<p>thanks for trying to help though</p>

              <p>update rscd_players where loggedin=‘1’ to loggedin=‘0’ or smth should be the command. If you want, put in the "username=USERNAMEONLINE(I don’t know how that’s stored, haven’t looked around enough, sorry).</p>
<p>Couldn’t really understand what your problem is…</p>
