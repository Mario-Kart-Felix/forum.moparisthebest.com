    <description> :eek: So, Yeah. I have 2 questions and PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE Answer or make a suggestion if you have some knowledge. The first question is, If I messed with the server.java file (take things out that doesen&#39;t need to be tooken out) or took it out of the main folder of a source, Could people still connect to your no-ip? 

That was #1 ^


2nd. If you have wireless security on your router would that interupt your no-ip?
