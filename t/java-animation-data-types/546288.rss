    <title>[Java] Animation data types</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-animation-data-types/546288</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been trying to create 2d animations with a skeletal structure and I&#39;m wondering what the best way to preserve the hierarchy of body parts while animating all parts is.

Thinking simply, I need to remember that if you rotate a torso, all of the other body parts on top of it have to still be connected to it, rather than just the torso rotating. So, I need to remember the hierarchy of torso -&gt; arms+head -&gt; forearms -&gt; hands etc

I&#39;m wondering what the best way to store animation data for the skeletal structure is (it&#39;ll probably just be four possible types of movement, being [Δx, Δy, Δrotation and scale])

My problem is I&#39;m not sure what data types to use or how to set up the class structure for this.

Here&#39;s how I have the nodes for the skeletal system set up (the bones essentially)

[code=java8]
	private Position offset;
	private List&lt;Node&gt; children;
	private String name;
	private Image image;

	public Node(List&lt;Node&gt; children, String name, Image image, Position offset) {
		this.children = children;
		this.name = name;
		this.image = image;
		this.offset = offset;
	}
[/code]
As you can see the nodes rely on having children nodes (so the torso knows it has the children of head + arm, arm knows it has lower arm). This makes storing animation data a pain in the ass if only the hand is rotating. This also has a lot of problems as it relies on images rather than bones (I can fix this myself).

Basically I need to figure out a way to store the animation data (position change, rotation change, scale) with respect to each body part (because if you move a hand and nothing else, you need to be able to track that it&#39;s the hand moving obviously) and still keeping track of the hierarchy (so if you only rotate the torso and nothing else, everything connected to the torso rotates in unison).

If you have any ideas or previous experience with this I&#39;d love to hear how you guys have approached any similar problems</description>

well yeah it does thats why forums have boards <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>here’s how i’d approach the problem, you’re sayng that if the torso rotates the arms also rotate correct? so you have the overall object the “body” and the sub objects that make it up, arms, torso etc. You’ve got to think about it in terms of how the body moves, for example if you twist your torso the upper body will entirely rotate aound a fixed point, which will be the central z,x point of the torso. You need to group objects that react to the given movments you have and apply the same method of rotation, scaling, positioning etc to each one</p>

<p>So that sounds memory expensive. If there were 200 players on screen, I would have maybe 1400 nodes. Just from players. I’d rather not double that and load 2800 classes when it’s entirely unnecessary. Copying nodes every frame would also take way too much memory</p>
<p>Edit: I still need help with finding a good way to store this data. I’m really not sure how to do this.<br>
List of data that needs to be stored and kept relative:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bones (position + hierarchy)</li>
<li>Images</li>
<li>Animations (relative to bones)</li>

<p>So that alone takes care of the hierarchy problem, but what about animations? I’m not sure what format to store those in. I could use object names for references possibly? Or just store ints for movements per frame in arrays? I’m just not sure how to store animations while relating them to their respective body parts while keeping the hierarchy.</p>
