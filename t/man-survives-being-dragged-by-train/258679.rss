    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;MEXICO CITY (Jan. 26) -- A Mexico City man is alive and nearly unscathed after falling onto subway tracks and being dragged by a train.
Red Cross official Heriberto Escalera says the man suffered an epileptic seizure on the platform and passed out, falling onto the tracks.
The driver of an approaching train tried to stop before hitting the man, but ended up dragging him a short distance on Sunday.
Escalera said Monday the man suffered burns and bruises but wasn&#39;t seriously hurt.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


One lucky guy. Good thing he passed out  :o</description>
