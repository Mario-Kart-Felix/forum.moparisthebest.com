    <description>[size=12pt][i]How would i change the route for the restarter to a different source/ip? 
I had this auto restarter in a different source and transferd it over because
the one that was in it only had ip change, didn&#39;t have restart time and such

But can someone please tell me how i would edit the details in the auto restarter? Thanks!
