    <title>Compiler - JDK</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/compiler-jdk/231398</link>
    <description>[size=12pt]Hello pplz.[/size]

I will keep this short and simple so it&#39;s easy and fast, please, POST IF YOU KNOW WHAT&#39;S WRONG.

Okay, about 2 year&#39;s ago, I installed JDK and set the classpath&#39;s and everything worked, including me being able to compile.
My computer started acting up, and EVERYTHING on it was deleted.
The other day, I downloaded JDK 6u7 and following the TuT &quot;how to make a server&quot; I set my classpath&#39;s.
Now, of course, it does not work, only when I compile. I can still run a server though. This is what I get when I try to compile:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&#39;javac&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
Press any key to continue . . .&lt;/blockquote&gt;

OR...

&lt;blockquote&gt;You do not have JDK 5.0 or JDK 6.0 or any JDK 5.0 and 6.0 updates.
Go to Mod Taharok&#39;s tutorial on the Moparscape Tuturoials section
for step-by-step instructions to download the newest JDK Update.
Press any key to continue . . .&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of course I have the JDK installed and classpath&#39;s are set...
These are my classpath&#39;s:

[b]Classpath:[/b] CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_06\bin;%CLASSPATH%;
[b]Path:[/b] C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_06\bin;

^ I deleted JDK 6u7 and now have 6u6 installed, but it still does not work. ^

Please, if you have ANY idea of how I would get my compiler working again, it would be [u]REALLY APPRECIATED![/u]</description>
