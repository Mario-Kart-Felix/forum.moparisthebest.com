    <description>Theres this fag who keeps logging into my server, and moving my NPC&#39;s you can trade and it&#39;s pissing me off. I don&#39;t want to have to watch my server for hackers who are attacking my NPC&#39;s on a cheat client. So if there is anyway you can think of, that willl help me make it so Cheat client&#39;s such as. Bombs Cheat Client. Please. IM me or PM me. :)

So yeah. If any of you could help it would be appreciated greatly.
