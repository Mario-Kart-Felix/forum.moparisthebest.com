    <title>Infinity Ward Employees file lawsuit against Activision after being dismissed</title>

    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Update: Activision has responded to a lawsuit filed by former Infinity Ward executives Jason West and Vince Zampella, calling the suit &quot;meritless.&quot;

&quot;Activision is disappointed that Mr. Zampella and Mr. West have chosen to file a lawsuit, and believes their claims are meritless,&quot; reads a statement from the publisher.

Activision also stood by its decision to dismiss West and Zampella, saying it &quot;firmly believes that its decision was justified based on their course of conduct and actions.&quot;

&quot;Activision legitimately expected them to honor their obligations to Activision, just like any other executive who holds a position of trust in the company,&quot; reads their statement.

West and Zampella are seeking more than $36 million and the rights to all Modern Warfare branded games, reads a copy of the complaint sent to USA TODAY by the duo&#39;s lawyers.

The suit alleges Activision wanted to avoid paying the pair royalty payments for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 by launching an investigation with &quot;pre-ordained&quot; results to justify their dismissal.

&quot;From the very beginning, it was clear that the purpose of the investigation was not to uncover any facts concerning any actual wrongdoing, but to manufacture a basis to fire West and Zampella,&quot; the complaint reads.

West and Zampella&#39;s lawsuit refers to accusations of insubordination and breach of contract as &quot;false and trivial.&quot;

The lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court blames the rift between Activision and former Infinity Ward execs on the publisher&#39;s &quot;astonishing arrogance and unbridled greed.&quot;

The complaint also claims West and Zampella &quot;were interrogated for over six hours in a windowless conference room&quot; over President&#39;s Day weekend by Activision investigators; and that other Infinity Ward employees were &quot;brought to tears&quot; over questioning.

The lawsuit does not specify what the pair were allegedly accused of, but claim the incidents &quot;included events that West and Zampella were never even asked about during the investigation; identified conduct that other Activision executives engaged in with impunity; and cited &#39;insubordination&#39; and alleged conduct from over a year ago.&quot;

Our original post

Jason West and Vince Zampella, the former president and CEO respectively of Call of Duty studio Infinity Ward, are suing publisher Activision for breach of contract.

In a press release filed by their attorneys, West and Zampella claim Activision &quot;terminated their employment weeks before they were to be paid substantial royalty payments as part of their existing contracts for Modern Warfare 2.&quot;

&quot;After all we have given to Activision, we shouldn&#39;t have to sue to get paid,&quot; Zampella said in a statement.

&quot;We were shocked by Activision&#39;s decision to terminate our contract,&quot; adds West. &quot;We poured our heart and soul into that company, building not only a world class development studio, but assembling a team we&#39;ve been proud to work with for nearly a decade. We think the work we&#39;ve done speaks for itself.&quot;

An SEC filing from Activision shows the publisher was investigating &quot;two senior employees&quot; at Infinity Ward for alleged insubordination and breaches of contract, a probe the duo&#39;s lawyer calls &quot;unsubstantiated.&quot;

&quot;Activision has refused to honor the terms of its agreements and is intentionally flouting the fundamental public policy of this state (California) that employers must pay their employees what they have rightfully earned,&quot; says attorney Robert Schwartz.

Game Hunters has reached out to Activision for comment, and will provide an update with their response.

Activision revealed on Tuesday West and Zampella were no longer with Infinity Ward as part of a broader announcement on a new business unit for the Call of Duty franchise. Activision CTO Steve Pearce and production head Steve Ackrich will helm Infinity Ward on an interim basis.

I personally believe Activision should stop whining and give the two what they deserve.  It&#39;ll be interesting to see where this goes though.</description>

          <blockquote>
              <blockquote>Update: Activision has responded to a lawsuit filed by former Infinity Ward executives Jason West and Vince Zampella, calling the suit "meritless."
<p>“Activision is disappointed that Mr. Zampella and Mr. West have chosen to file a lawsuit, and believes their claims are meritless,” reads a statement from the publisher.</p>
<p>Activision also stood by its decision to dismiss West and Zampella, saying it “firmly believes that its decision was justified based on their course of conduct and actions.”</p>
<p>“Activision legitimately expected them to honor their obligations to Activision, just like any other executive who holds a position of trust in the company,” reads their statement.</p>
<p>West and Zampella are seeking more than $36 million and the rights to all Modern Warfare branded games, reads a copy of the complaint sent to USA TODAY by the duo’s lawyers.</p>
<p>The suit alleges Activision wanted to avoid paying the pair royalty payments for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 by launching an investigation with “pre-ordained” results to justify their dismissal.</p>
<p>“From the very beginning, it was clear that the purpose of the investigation was not to uncover any facts concerning any actual wrongdoing, but to manufacture a basis to fire West and Zampella,” the complaint reads.</p>
<p>West and Zampella’s lawsuit refers to accusations of insubordination and breach of contract as “false and trivial.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court blames the rift between Activision and former Infinity Ward execs on the publisher’s “astonishing arrogance and unbridled greed.”</p>
<p>The complaint also claims West and Zampella “were interrogated for over six hours in a windowless conference room” over President’s Day weekend by Activision investigators; and that other Infinity Ward employees were “brought to tears” over questioning.</p>
<p>The lawsuit does not specify what the pair were allegedly accused of, but claim the incidents “included events that West and Zampella were never even asked about during the investigation; identified conduct that other Activision executives engaged in with impunity; and cited ‘insubordination’ and alleged conduct from over a year ago.”</p>
<p>Our original post</p>
<p>Jason West and Vince Zampella, the former president and CEO respectively of Call of Duty studio Infinity Ward, are suing publisher Activision for breach of contract.</p>
<p>In a press release filed by their attorneys, West and Zampella claim Activision “terminated their employment weeks before they were to be paid substantial royalty payments as part of their existing contracts for Modern Warfare 2.”</p>
<p>“After all we have given to Activision, we shouldn’t have to sue to get paid,” Zampella said in a statement.</p>
<p>“We were shocked by Activision’s decision to terminate our contract,” adds West. “We poured our heart and soul into that company, building not only a world class development studio, but assembling a team we’ve been proud to work with for nearly a decade. We think the work we’ve done speaks for itself.”</p>
<p>An SEC filing from Activision shows the publisher was investigating “two senior employees” at Infinity Ward for alleged insubordination and breaches of contract, a probe the duo’s lawyer calls “unsubstantiated.”</p>
<p>“Activision has refused to honor the terms of its agreements and is intentionally flouting the fundamental public policy of this state (California) that employers must pay their employees what they have rightfully earned,” says attorney Robert Schwartz.</p>
<p>Game Hunters has reached out to Activision for comment, and will provide an update with their response.</p>
<p>Activision revealed on Tuesday West and Zampella were no longer with Infinity Ward as part of a broader announcement on a new business unit for the Call of Duty franchise. Activision CTO Steve Pearce and production head Steve Ackrich will helm Infinity Ward on an interim basis.</p>
