RuneScape Newsletter - Issue #1
Welcome to the first ever RuneScape newsletter.Firsly a big thank-you to everyone who&#39;s been playing, and has helped make RuneScape a great success. We only launched just over 2 weeks ago, and weal ready have over 28000 signed up players, and the game
has been played for a total time of over 4.5 years!

------------------------

What&#39;s new in Runescape

-----------------------
The RuneScape team has been working very hard over the past 2 weeks to improve the game and bring you new features.

Major new features are:

New desert city Al-kharid with:

-Scimitar shop: Buy and sell curvy swords

-Furnace: Conveniant for smelting ore from the desert

-Silk trader: Buy silk here and sell it in varrock for a profit. The amount youmake depends on how many other people are silk trading.

-General store: Another place to buy and sell your items-Platemail Legs shop: A full range of leg armour to spend your money
on

-Kebab shop: Eating kebabs has a random effect. They&#39;re normally good, but rumour has it that a few of them are a bit dodgy. They&#39;ll never kill you though


New Quest in Draynor Manor

Draynor Manor has been opened and there&#39;s spooky things inside! There&#39;s a vampire asleep in the cellar, and
Professor Oddenstein who lives in the attichas accidently turned someone into a chicken! To make things worse gremlins have hidden the parts of his machine, so he can&#39;t turn the chicken back. 
Can you find the missing pieces to complete this quest?

Plus over the past 2 weeks we&#39;ve also

-Improved the map page to show the locations of useful shops

-Added a &#39;who&#39;s playing&#39; page so you can see if your friends are on

-Made Lumbridge safe to give a place to hide from player killers

-Improved the shops to reduce queueing

-Reduced the network requirements so the game works over more connections

-Fixed lots of little problems/bugs with the game to make it more reliable

What&#39;s planned

--------------

We are of course working on many more improvements to add to the game to make it even better. We have nearly finished work on the bank which will hopefully be added to Varrock city tomorrow. The bank is a safe place to store your money,such that even if you die it can&#39;t be lost. 
After that the magic system is due for a big overhaul with lots of new spells being added, plus we&#39;ll be adding some entirely new professions such as crafting and fishing to add even more variety to the game. The next planned quest is &#39;The vampire slayer quest&#39; in which you must work out how to slay the evil vampire currently sleeping in Draynor Manor.

Runescape hiscores

------------------

Below are the top scores as they were at 3pm GMT on Sunday-21st. Only the top 25 players are shown, but I&#39;m planning on adding a new page to the website soon which will allow you to search for the ranking of any player and see how you compare with everyone else.

The hiscores are currently in 4 categories. If there are more categories which you think should be included let me know and I&#39;ll consider putting them in the next newsletter.

<p>What’s new in Runescape</p>
<hr>
<p>The RuneScape team has been working very hard over the past 2 weeks to improve the game and bring you new features.</p>
<p>Major new features are:</p>
<p>New desert city Al-kharid with:</p>
<p>-Scimitar shop: Buy and sell curvy swords</p>
<p>-Furnace: Conveniant for smelting ore from the desert</p>
<p>-Silk trader: Buy silk here and sell it in varrock for a profit. The amount youmake depends on how many other people are silk trading.</p>
<p>-General store: Another place to buy and sell your items-Platemail Legs shop: A full range of leg armour to spend your money<br>
on</p>
<p>-Kebab shop: Eating kebabs has a random effect. They’re normally good, but rumour has it that a few of them are a bit dodgy. They’ll never kill you though</p>
<p>New Quest in Draynor Manor</p>
<p>Draynor Manor has been opened and there’s spooky things inside! There’s a vampire asleep in the cellar, and<br>
Professor Oddenstein who lives in the attichas accidently turned someone into a chicken! To make things worse gremlins have hidden the parts of his machine, so he can’t turn the chicken back.<br>
Can you find the missing pieces to complete this quest?</p>
<p>Plus over the past 2 weeks we’ve also</p>
<p>-Improved the map page to show the locations of useful shops</p>
<p>-Added a ‘who’s playing’ page so you can see if your friends are on</p>
<p>-Made Lumbridge safe to give a place to hide from player killers</p>
<p>-Improved the shops to reduce queueing</p>
<p>-Reduced the network requirements so the game works over more connections</p>
<p>-Fixed lots of little problems/bugs with the game to make it more reliable</p>
<p>What’s planned</p>
<hr>
<p>We are of course working on many more improvements to add to the game to make it even better. We have nearly finished work on the bank which will hopefully be added to Varrock city tomorrow. The bank is a safe place to store your money,such that even if you die it can’t be lost.<br>
After that the magic system is due for a big overhaul with lots of new spells being added, plus we’ll be adding some entirely new professions such as crafting and fishing to add even more variety to the game. The next planned quest is ‘The vampire slayer quest’ in which you must work out how to slay the evil vampire currently sleeping in Draynor Manor.</p>
<p>Runescape hiscores</p>
<hr>
<p>Below are the top scores as they were at 3pm GMT on Sunday-21st. Only the top 25 players are shown, but I’m planning on adding a new page to the website soon which will allow you to search for the ranking of any player and see how you compare with everyone else.</p>
