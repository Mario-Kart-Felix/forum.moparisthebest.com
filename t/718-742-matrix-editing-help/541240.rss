    <description>Well it looks like i might need some help after all....

1: I have searched around and did not find a way to copy items, give them they&#39;re own ids/names, and edit they&#39;re stats and prices.

2: been looking for the location of both, global exp and drop rates, i don&#39;t wanna have to edit each and every monster drop.

3: last but not least(most important), i need a list of guides that help me with.....

object placement(bank chests, booths, NPCs, thief stalls, ore veins, furnace, anvil, trees, fishing spots, ect.
changing my account name, NPC renaming.
changing the respawn speeds of ore veins, trees, fishing spots, monsters, ect.
custom teleports, changing the home teleport location, ect.
making ::home teleport player to the home base and have home tele in magic tab stick to lodestones, stuff like that.
lol, making a custom weapon that not only 1 hits, it logs the player out and temp or perma bans the target(BAN HAMMER!!!).

I can&#39;t think of what else i might need.</description>
