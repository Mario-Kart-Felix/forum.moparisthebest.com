    <description>Not a rant, but hear me out

Think about this, or tell someone. Next time you or them says &quot;My life sucks&quot; or &quot;Fuck my life&quot;. You think you had it bad? Put yourself in the position of the man who dropped the atomic bomb on hiroshima, how would you feel knowing you were responsible for millions of children and women dead, by your hand. Now think about the person who gave birth to there young baby, 9 months of pain and torture, and what happens? The baby comes out with a disease and the doctors say he will not make it a week. What about the homeless and deaf kid with cancer? Imagine your the one, who has to kill those innocent cute dogs, because noone claimed them as there own. Imagine your that dog, cold and helpess, left to die. Now picture you as an innocent person, walking to there house, only about 50 feet away, and a drunk driver swerves into you and hits you into a coma. You wake up and your paralyzed, and suffer short term memory loss. Now think about that next time you here someone say &quot;Fuck my life&quot; or &quot;My life sucks&quot; Think about the homeless child with cancer, being hit by a drunk driver, think about the man who dropped the bomb. And you say your life sucks

Unless you are a hypocrite and when you feel down you tell everyone about whats wrong with your life but believe it isn’t okay for others to do the same.</p>
<p>PS: I love how that was you’re first post on this forum, so fucking random lol.[/quote]I have to disagree with that (in my experience). I used to be an emo faggot and get really depressed and continuously whine to people, and it made me more and more depressed. Since I realised that people don’t actually give a shit how I feel and I stopped whining, the depression started to go.</p>

<p>Think about this, or tell someone. Next time you or them says “My life sucks” or “Fuck my life”. You think you had it bad? Put yourself in the position of the man who dropped the atomic bomb on hiroshima, how would you feel knowing you were responsible for millions of children and women dead, by your hand. Now think about the person who gave birth to there young baby, 9 months of pain and torture, and what happens? The baby comes out with a disease and the doctors say he will not make it a week. What about the homeless and deaf kid with cancer? Imagine your the one, who has to kill those innocent cute dogs, because noone claimed them as there own. Imagine your that dog, cold and helpess, left to die. Now picture you as an innocent person, walking to there house, only about 50 feet away, and a drunk driver swerves into you and hits you into a coma. You wake up and your paralyzed, and suffer short term memory loss. Now think about that next time you here someone say “Fuck my life” or “My life sucks” Think about the homeless child with cancer, being hit by a drunk driver, think about the man who dropped the bomb. And you say your life sucks<br>
