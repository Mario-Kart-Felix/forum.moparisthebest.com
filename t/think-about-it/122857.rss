    <description>This is directly quoted from [url=http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,171925.0.html]http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,171925.0.html[/url]. I feel we need to know this saying that I posted.

[quote=&quot;Nets8, post:41, topic:122280&quot;]She could be a n00b, a genius, or whatever. Even if she&#39;s just starting out and she expects this big project of hers, it&#39;s better than more than half of the people on Moparscape who don&#39;t even try. Have you seen how Moparscape is now? Full of new people, the experienced people flaming them, and all the crap. We are all new at once, and no one can deny that. I believe, I believe, you should always give someone credit for saying they will try this, and not flame the crap out of them. It&#39;s getting harder and harder to learn nowadays.[/quote]</description>
