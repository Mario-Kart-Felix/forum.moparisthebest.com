    <description>The ServerSoft Development Team is a company, Irl. However, the company is running low on employees, and for the fact that most people we try to hire are in-experienced, and lack the basic needs to join the team. So, we decided to make an online Development Team!

So far, our server has 100% [b]Perfect[/b] [b]Grand Exchange![/b]
So far, our server has 100% [b]Perfect[/b] [b]Skilling, and other Minigames[/b]
