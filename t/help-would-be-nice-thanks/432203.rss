    <description>How do i make a readable book in pi base. Like i want to make a request gamebook button and it shows all the Rules and stuff and i was wondering how do i make that? I&#39;ve seen a book reading tut at moparscape / rune-server but that was a different base.

+

How do i make so a npc teleport you to places, like a guide.
With that i mean, when we click on him, he will teleport to places and show us places in game ( we can&#39;t teleport or walk )

and when we done he teleport us back.

Thanks. ;D</description>

<ol>
<li>In your item method (clicking an item ingame) add the method where you an interface will open.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>sendInterface(141);
sendQuest("hello", 145); //title
</code><br>
And so on. (the above code won’t work)</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>In your first click npc file add something like</li>
</ol>
<p><code>if(NPCID == 1) {
toX = coords;
toY = coords;
}</code><br>
This method will tele you to a certain place. Add a dialogue with it and add something like<br>
Walking = false;</p>
