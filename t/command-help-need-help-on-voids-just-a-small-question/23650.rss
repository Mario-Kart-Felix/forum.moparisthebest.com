    <title>Command help. Need help on voids [Just a small question]</title>

    <description>M&#39;kay, all i need to know now is... well... i dunno what the bank voids are :$ Otherwise, Its all good 

[Thanks, Javacisnotrecognized, for the main part :P]


&lt;blockquote&gt;Okay, Well to start off, lets explain what i am trying to do. I have made a command that spawns you a god cape (guthix, sara, or zammy, depending on the command) and i have to make it so that there is no way the player can spawn more than one type of cape (Can&#39;t spawn guthix and zammy, zammy and sara, guthix and sara, or in 3 packs). What i did was this...

[code]if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;guthix&quot;)) {
		if (playerHasItem(2412) == true || playerHasItem(2414) == true) {
			sendMessage(&quot;You can&#39;t represent more than 1 House Of The Gods!&quot;);
		} else {
			addItem(2413, 1);
		}
	}[/code]

But that only works with their current inventory, if they have a zammy or sara cape in their inventory, they can&#39;t spawn the guthix cape, if they have zammy or sara in their bank, they can still spawn guthix. What it looks like i will have to do is add to the class files a new thing similar to playerHasItem, but built for the bank and the equip spot. I dunno for sure, but i think there isn&#39;t one of these already, if there is, i&#39;d like to know... obviously lol, but if there isn&#39;t, i&#39;d like some help please. :P

And thats that, i&#39;ll just wait for some discussion. [br][size=1]Posted at: November 08, 2006, 10:03:08 PM[/size][hr]Does no one really know how to do this :$?[br][size=1]Posted at: November 09, 2006, 11:00:32 AM[/size][hr][me=Patchumz]coughs[/me]&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
