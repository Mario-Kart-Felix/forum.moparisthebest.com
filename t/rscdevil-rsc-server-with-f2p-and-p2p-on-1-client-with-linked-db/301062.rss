    <description>Hey everyone,

I would like to take this opportunity to invite you to check out our new and improved RSC server (www.rscdevil.org).  We have put lots of time and effort into trying to create the most fun, enjoyable and close replicating RSC server (with a few extra perks) so that our players can enjoy the game they once played.

After putting it to a vote we have decided that on Saturday 12th September we will be resetting our server completely. 

[b][u]Our Updates:[/u][/b]

F2P and P2P on 1 client (with world selector buttons) which saves to the SAME database (like original RSC)

Apologies for the pic qualities

Full Dragon armour and weapons – As well as dragon axe, long, med and square (2 halves need to be smithed) we also have dragon plate, legs, large, chain, kite and 2h which will be added to the KBD.  All the new items have been extensively tested and bonuses have been carefully worked on so that dragon armour/weapon gives a realistic increase.

Webclient!

Small updates – Cooking gauntlets, withdraw X from bank, Combat Formulae (our formulae has been worked on to make it closer to that of RSC), new training areas etc, to see the rest come check us out!

[url=http://img.imagedash.com/fGTH.jpg][img]http://img.imagedash.com/fGTH.jpg[/img][/url]

We also have great pking areas in the wild (rune castle, alters, kbd, pirates etc) and staking anywhere ofc!


[b][u]Regular Events:[/u][/b]

On the first two days (Sat 12th and Sun 13th September) we will hold drop parties which will include some rares (party hats, masks santa hats etc) and other useful items.

Wars - (different level wars with different rules for prizes (armour, weapons, xp or free subs!)

Treasure hunts for prizes

Taverley Races

Staking Competitions (the best staker at a certain level will get free subs)

Clan Wars

and more!

We also have a mature and friendly staff team and community.


[b][u]About me:[/u][/b]

I am self employed and run my own business from home in England which means I have many free hours to put into the server.  As I work from home I am almost always a mouse click away from the game/forums if we have any problems or queries.  The paypal for RSCDevil is not linked to my bank account or any bank account and all monies donated to the server or subbed go to paying the dedi each month, so you can be assured we are serious about running our server.

I think that as the players are the key to the success of an RSC server, the players should be involved in giving update ideas and suggestions (as they are the ones playing)  We are also always on the lookout for new staff so if you have exp as staff or just love the game then there is always a chance you can get on the staff team or the coding development team (if that’s your thing)

[b][u]Future Updates:[/u][/b]

Agility

Fishing (1 click fishes X amount of times) and looking at adding Sea Turtles and Manta Rays

Woodcut (1 click swings at tree X amount of times depending on hatchet)

Mining (Same as Woodcut)

Clans, clan chat and clan wars

Quests (Quests are boring as we’ve all done them, so we will be writing brand new quests for you to complete for xp, items or even free subs!

New website

Pathing (we are looking into making the walking much closer to RSC)

Combat Formulae (although our formulae has been worked on over the past 3 years, we are always looking to improve it to get as close to RSC as possible)


[b][u]Possible Updates:[/u][/b]

IRC in client
Weaken Spells
Poison (Not Alice Cooper)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[i]The first month xp rates will be 6x for members and 8x for subs and will then return to 4x and 6x for members and subs respectively[/i]

Thanks for your time and we look forward to seeing you in the future.  Reset is Saturday 12th September, you may register at www.rscdevil.org


[b]P.S THIS IS NOT A DOWNLOADED SOURCE LIKE MOST OTHER SERVERS.  THIS SERVER HAS BEEN EXTENSIVLY WORKED ON FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE UPDATED.[/b]

              <p>I rarely post in random forums, but it seems that there is an abundance of false information in this thread that needs to be clarified, so I have registered for the sole purpose of posting in this thread.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We never recommend <a href="http://serverwizards.com" rel="nofollow noopener">serverwizards.com</a> as the ‘leader in security’ or ‘leader in management’, or leader in anything.  We recommend serverwizards because they’re cheap, in fact, the cheapest we have ever found.  We are an unmanaged hosting provider.  If a customer requires management, we refer them to a third party management company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have been known to temporarily increase customer security rates to absorb larger attacks temporarily.  We do not offer 2 Gbps security for $180/month.  I’m not sure if any reputable ISP could, as the bandwidth cost alone would lead to enormous loss.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Staminus Communications provides advanced ddos mitigation that is unrivaled for the price.  Simply put, we provide a very sought-after service that is priced well below our notable competitors.  The fact that a large portion of private RSC is hosted securely at Staminus is a good indication of this.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

              <p>Hey, I have spoken with Server Wizards and at the moment the main concern is money, because we didn’t take much money in October (due to the 2 hacks) we couldn’t pay the dedi.  Server Wizards will set the server back up for me, provide a dedi and manage the server for $150 a month as I have the F2P, P2P and PK Source and I have the latest Database save (Before the Hack).</p>
<p>As well as finding the money for the first months Dedi I also need to find a legit coder who is willing to be a part of the project and in return when the server is bringing in subs again they can receive money for coding.</p>
<p>The main problem with finding a legit coder is that 90% of the coders out there just want to hack, DDOS and steal sources.</p>
<p>If a legit coder wants to be a part of the RSCDevil development team please message me on Moparscape, main area needed will ofc be Java.</p>

              <p>Hey guys (and girls),</p>
<p>Sorry I have been away but October and November are 2 of the busiest months of the year for me (in terms of work) and with the server taking up most of my time I have had to put it to the back seat for a while.</p>
<p>To cut a long story short the server was hacked (as you all know)  Staminus recommended I pay server wizards (leaders in server protection) to make the server safe from hackers.</p>
<p>What ServerWizards did:</p>
<p>Secured SSH<br>
Secured VNC<br>
Secured SQL</p>
<p>Unfortunately soon after this we were hacked AGAIN!  ServerWizars immediately looked into the server and their firewalls and detection devices showed that SSH, VNC and SQL were absolutely fine and there were no breaches via any of these access points.  They came to the conclusion that the hackers got in through the PUNBB forums and gained access to my admin account (the version of PUNBB we were using was old and needed updating or changing).</p>
<p>Whilst I was working with ServerWizards to update the forums and make them secure Staminus billed me for the month of October.  Due to the fact we were hacked twice in October and were offline for most of it we did not gain enough money to make the dedi payment (resulting in Staminus immediately closing the server)</p>
<p>There is some money in the PayPal account (not enough to cover the entire payment) and I have emailed Staminus asking them if they will take part payment now and put the server back online so we can get some money brought in but they have yet to email back.</p>
<p>I am going to re-email them again and see if they will answer, but if not there is a backup plan as ServerWizards not only manage server security, but they also offer dedicated servers with DDOS protection.</p>
<p>I have had some offers from people to help out in terms of coding and technical support and ex mods and players have said they want the server back up.  I am confident that I can get the server back up and running but not sure exactly when as there are lots of obstacles to get past first (and of course I still have another week of work built up to finish)</p>
<p>For your peace of mind I have:<br>
A copy of the Source<br>
A copy of the Database (Accounts, stats, xp, banks, inventories etc etc)</p>
<p>So as soon as I have sorted out the dedi and fixed the weakness’ on the forums I can have the game up and running just like before.</p>
<p>Once again sorry I haven’t been about but I hope you can understand that as soon as I log onto msn 500 people PM me asking “what’s going on”</p>
<p>I have not given up, I don’t give up I have just been really busy and it’s typical that we were hacked now, as I was hoping that I could leave the server up and running whilst I was working this past 6 weeks, (but things never work out like that)</p>
<p>Love ya all and look forward to RSCing with ya ASAP</p>

              <p>Hey guys (and girls),</p>
<p>Sorry I have been away but October and November are 2 of the busiest months of the year for me (in terms of work) and with the server taking up most of my time I have had to put it to the back seat for a while.</p>
<p>To cut a long story short the server was hacked (as you all know)  Staminus recommended I pay server wizards (leaders in server protection) to make the server safe from hackers.</p>
<p>What ServerWizards did:</p>
<p>Secured SSH<br>
Secured VNC<br>
Secured SQL</p>
<p>Unfortunately soon after this we were hacked AGAIN!  ServerWizars immediately looked into the server and their firewalls and detection devices showed that SSH, VNC and SQL were absolutely fine and there were no breaches via any of these access points.  They came to the conclusion that the hackers got in through the PUNBB forums and gained access to my admin account (the version of PUNBB we were using was old and needed updating or changing).</p>
<p>Whilst I was working with ServerWizards to update the forums and make them secure Staminus billed me for the month of October.  Due to the fact we were hacked twice in October and were offline for most of it we did not gain enough money to make the dedi payment (resulting in Staminus immediately closing the server)</p>
<p>There is some money in the PayPal account (not enough to cover the entire payment) and I have emailed Staminus asking them if they will take part payment now and put the server back online so we can get some money brought in but they have yet to email back.</p>
<p>I am going to re-email them again and see if they will answer, but if not there is a backup plan as ServerWizards not only manage server security, but they also offer dedicated servers with DDOS protection.</p>
<p>I have had some offers from people to help out in terms of coding and technical support and ex mods and players have said they want the server back up.  I am confident that I can get the server back up and running but not sure exactly when as there are lots of obstacles to get past first (and of course I still have another week of work built up to finish)</p>
<p>For your peace of mind I have:<br>
A copy of the Source<br>
A copy of the Database (Accounts, stats, xp, banks, inventories etc etc)</p>
<p>So as soon as I have sorted out the dedi and fixed the weakness’ on the forums I can have the game up and running just like before.</p>
<p>Once again sorry I haven’t been about but I hope you can understand that as soon as I log onto msn 500 people PM me asking “what’s going on” <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I have not given up, I don’t give up I have just been really busy and it’s typical that we were hacked now, as I was hoping that I could leave the server up and running whilst I was working this past 6 weeks, (but things never work out like that)</p>

Luke you dont know anything about coding… you have GawDz doing the work and Zilent…</p>
<p>u dont even know HTML… the most basic of all languages… your simply the figurehead of RSCE and take all the credit…<br>
[/quote]<br>
I don’t do JAVA but I worked as a commercial web developer for 3 years, so I think I can just about manage HTML. GaWdZ doesn’t run RSCEmulation any more, it’s just me and Zilent. Think what you want in all honesty, it doesn’t effect nor bother me.[/quote]<br>
