    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/old-merchant-street-untill-it-goes-live/162952</link>
    <description>Ok well im planning on having a non-combat server, not that im too lazy to code fighting but because I wanted to add a change to the regular server and change runescape into a slightly different game... I was wondering how many people would at least give this a go, so that I can see if its worth my time. I mean I will still make it because I like the idea but it would be cool if I can get support for you guys too. 

Please don&#39;t flame or give critisizum (sorry about the spelling not sure how its spelt.) unless its constructive or giving ideas on which I could improve the plot to my game.

[code]PLOT:

You start with a rather basic character, who is aiming for fame in the large world of runescape.
When you first start you will notice lots of objects are around the world and each have a different selling value, 
for example shrimp might only get you 5gp a time, whereas a party hat (if your lucky enough to come across one) could sell for billions! 
Your aim is to make as much money as you can while collecting 1 of each item around the world, 
which with  around 3000-5000 items around to collect should take you a while.
Ofcourse there will be competitions and various ways to boost your money but also hopefully ways you will loose big money aswell so its not too easy.

Many items will only appear in shops for you to buy and sell to either other players or shops. Can you become the richest member in all of runescpae while finding out the history of this world on the website? Goodluck![/code]

So thats my plot, I hope you like it cause I really want to get going with this project more so please tell me your view. Thankyou.

Just post your comments thanks.



PLEASE REPLY, then I can see what features people would like me to add and what there thoughts on the game are, but please read the rules I stated above. Thankyou.

              <p>Aye just thought id let you know how mines is going… well, Ive made a client and im very confident with textures and that so I have made my own cage in a forest as an enclosed area, it has a different floor texture (thx to kevin’s tut) and ive renamed about 100 items and took out some other features to balance the lagg state, Ive made this cave purple and a plant in the middle of it (its just a normal plant untill i learn how to model my own objects) when you pick it you have a 50/50 chance of bieng posioned and going into combat with a lvl 100 troll (thx to lescape for teaching me about animations) he shoots a RANDOM kbd projectile every few seconds… so i mean like a earth blast then fire blast then a water blast you know… and you can’t run from it and when it dies your screen fades to black then it fades back to normal and your back home and a NPC dialogue auto starts (all this was done through boolean process()) Im glad I learnt about forcewalk and that other stuff, but its better altogether if you just start small with a few areas then enhance them then move on when they are both 100% thats how i did it… added spades working in over 150 areas (took a week) and dramen logs are a replacement for runes (only some spells work, the ones that dont, don’t show as I edited their sprites and clickable packets)</p>

<p>That is the general idea of my server, but of course it all depends whether or not I can get the skills working but you gradually earn money and stuff. I think im going to open it out a little so that pking is allowed but im not gunna edit the testscape server to equate for it as its not my main aim. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I could and might go with a pk server so that you can pk while still aiming to get to the top as im sure that would fit more peoples ideas of fun, however im going to mainly focus on the merchant side of things first.</p>

              <p>[quote=“mankk, post:9, topic:162952”]Thats the bit im concerned about, making it 24.7 because of course with a limited budget its going to be hard and also highscores although I will see if theres a tutorial for that cause im not too sure how I could make that work. I doubt I can get this 24.7 at the moment however I should be able to have it online throughout certain times of the day unless im on holiday it should be able to stay online for a while each day. Im always a bit nervous about letting someone else host it for me because last time I did that I found it hard to get out of the payments when I wanted to cancel. I will see, im sure people wont mind if the server isn’t on 24.7 as many arn’t, but I will try and keep the server online as much as possible, and as far as highscores are concerned Ill try and find a tutorial otherwise theres no real need for one, as players can show off what that have gained anyway. I don’t see your point though dd, but we’ll see how it goes, im trying my best for a 15yr old and no job at the moment.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>How can you not see my point? Players will be wanting to come back if they are competing for something. Making it 24/7 helps get more players. Not difficult to understand.</p>

              <p>Wow thanks for so many positive comments?! Well in that case I’ll get to work. I’ve decided since I’ve been out that I shall try to add more that just the basic plot, maybe a few combat quests for those who want to try it but it wont be compulsary so all items will be available weather you choose combat or not, however the overall theme will be non-combat merchanting.</p>
<p>Feel free to post your ideas here for the time being as I haven’t got a download yet, I will however post pictures and hopefully edit the game to your liking, thanks for your interests again though and I’ll update this soon.</p>

              <p>The non-combat idea is what i don’t like because some items must be hard to get so you should make a realy hard quest with combat as it should be a challage <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
