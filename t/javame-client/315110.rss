    <title>Javame client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/javame-client/315110</link>
    <description>ok i had a thought awhile back. i dont have experience in javame but i have a want to learn it but dont have the time. i was looking at javafx before but not that much.idk fx is suppose to work on mobile phone but idk and idk if its possible to program a 3d client in fx or ME. i rethought this after i seen virtualizes&#39; resizeable client release. i know you would need a powerful phone for a client but if you took out non-essential stuff and other things to make it run faster on a phone. i also wondered if it would be possible to connect through bluetooth instead of moblie web. sorry if i am not making any sense im extremely tired. thx</description>
