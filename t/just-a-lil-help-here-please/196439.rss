    <title>Just a lil&#39; help here, please?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/just-a-lil-help-here-please/196439</link>
    <description>Ok, so i don&#39;t need help with any errors, i know partly some of Java but i haven&#39;t got a complete hold of Java yet. I&#39;ve done programming languages related to Java called the Game Maker Language of the popular [url=http://www.yoyogames.com/]Game Maker[/url] software..

Anyways i need some help, I&#39;ve changed the strings of a few of the quest tabs in the Texthandler (the buttons when you use emotes).
Now i need to figure out how to change the function of these tabs, that&#39;s where i need your help!

I went in client.java and I tried searching for:
[code]void sendFrame126[/code]

because i knew the function sendFrame126 was in Texthandler.java. But i searched, all I saw was this:
[code]	public void sendFrame126(String s, int id) {
		outStream.createFrameVarSizeWord(126);
		outStream.writeString(s);
		outStream.writeWordA(id);
		outStream.endFrameVarSizeWord();
		flushOutStream();
	}[/code]

Now this just made my mind very puzzled because i never heard of anything called outStream. The most confusing thing is it looks like some kind of pointer, it doesn&#39;t look like a function, and i cannot find where outStream is used.

Now i have absolutely no idea what outStream is but if anyone can give me help on how to change ANY of the quest button functions much thanks and MAYBE even credits to that person.. :)</description>
