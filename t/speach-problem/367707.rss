    <title>Speach Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/speach-problem/367707</link>
    <description>Alright so, I had finally finished my perfect server, then i saw it.

Some1 got on and when they say &quot;Hi&quot; i saw it as &quot;Il&quot;

What i&#39;m sayin is when someone gets on and uses my client, only they can see what there truly saying. i thought it was because some1 was playing on Silab or something but i figured its not. If some1 could help i&#39;d really appreciate it. I bought a VPS and eveything and don&#39;t want it to go to waste.</description>
