    <title>Best Company you used to host a server (Of any game type)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/best-company-you-used-to-host-a-server-of-any-game-type/382900</link>
    <description>   First of all ill just say im sorry if this is the wrong area. I haven&#39;t been on mopar for a few months at least but I am getting back into it and I wondered whats the best hosting site you guys have ever used? Im looking to spend about 30$-40$ a month and hoping to get around 1gb to 1.5gb&#39;s of ram. Im going to be running a delta but I have fixed a lot of the memory leeks in it and its pretty good at player handling. So share past experience with sites if you could =D, please note I will never Use www.vpsland.com because its the worst service I have ever had.</description>

<p>This is true, the specs of your home computer don’t matter, your home internet connection is not fast enough to host a server, so to host a decent one you need a VPS at least.</p>

              <p>Please don’t listen to Vain as he talks out of his ass, your computer specs actually don’t matter as much as how fast your internet is. That is why most people get a vps. Not to mention that if you want a respectable server you want your uptime as close to 100 percent as possible which is hardly attainable on a home computer.</p>

<p>I thought of doing this but at the moment I can’t afford the 300-600$ to buy a computer tower or a cheep laptop, so I am going to do this for the first month or two till I can save up enough to buy one.</p>

              <p>First of all ill just say im sorry if this is the wrong area. I haven’t been on mopar for a few months at least but I am getting back into it and I wondered whats the best hosting site you guys have ever used? Im looking to spend about 30$-40$ a month and hoping to get around 1gb to 1.5gb’s of ram. Im going to be running a delta but I have fixed a lot of the memory leeks in it and its pretty good at player handling. So share past experience with sites if you could =D, please note I will never Use <a href="http://www.vpsland.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.vpsland.com</a> because its the worst service I have ever had.</p>
