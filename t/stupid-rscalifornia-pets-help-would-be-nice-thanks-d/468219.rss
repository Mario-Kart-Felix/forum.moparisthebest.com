    <description>ok so i added alot of hunter stuff and i was wanting to make it to where you could catch patypus and then use it as a pet right. so i go into pets.java and it has tzrek jad and that works as a pet. so i add the platypus and it doesnt work. so i delete the tzrek jad stuff and it still works?!?!? then i got a baby bulldog and it works as a pet!!! and its not even in freakin pets.java!!!!!!! its driving me crazy. it makes no sense to me. if someone has had this problem and figured it out please help. and dont bother telling me to google it. i wouldnt have wasted my time writing this if i didnt already do this.</description>
