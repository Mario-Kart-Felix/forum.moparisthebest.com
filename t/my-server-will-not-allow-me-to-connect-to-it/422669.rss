    <title>My server will not allow me to connect to it?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-server-will-not-allow-me-to-connect-to-it/422669</link>
    <description>I have recently &quot;port-forwarded&quot; on my SKY router and done everything I&#39;m sure I needed to do because it says runenightmare.no-ip.org is online with most server status checkers (I am keeping the server up for you to verify that if you need to.) Though if I try to connect with the source I&#39;m running (Devolution 2.7 by Killamess) with the client (Moparscape 3.2 w/ Aryan) it doesn&#39;t work. However obviously, it still lets me connect with Localhost (0.0.0.0)/(127.0.0.1) (It then disconnects me virtually straight away but that&#39;s an issue with the client compatability I&#39;m sure and it should therefore do the exact same thing using the No-IP but it doesn&#39;t?</description>

              <p>umm if others couldn’t connect maybe the client doesn’t have the right ip or you didn’t portforward right?</p>

              <p>it disconnects you due to the moparscape client’s compatibility maybe find a client for it that works and your suppose to use 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0 the other people use your no-ip</p>
