    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/using-constants-to-improve-readability/535027</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;m making a tutorial on why you should use constants for making the readability better.
Alright first of all, everything that is static and final (Having all both them) is a constant.

1- Making a constant
First of all to make a constant you have to put:
[code=java]public static final[/code]
then the variable type, in the example im gonna make i&#39;ll use an integer.
[code=java]public static final int[/code]
The constant name, in this case its related to firemaking, but please remember that all the constants are written all uppercase, and to separate a word you use an underscore
[code=java]public static final int FIREMAKING_SKILL_ID[/code]
then you have to initialize the variable, as it is constant, you have to initialize it.
[code=java]public static final int FIREMAKING_SKILL_ID = 11;[/code]

2: Alright strucker so why do you do that?
Well i think that it helps to improve readability(Along with getters and stuff)because for example when im reading up a skill and i see
[code=java]addSkillXp(100, 11);[/code]
I&#39;m like what the fudge does that mean?
But with getters and constants you could make that piece of code understandable without needing to coment it or anything like that. example:
[code=java]addSkillXp(LogData.getExperience(), FIREMAKING_SKILL_ID);[/code]
well in personal i find that more understandable, i kinda get that it adds the experience to the firemaking skill id, but what would you have thought from:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[code=java]addSkillXp(100, 11);[/code]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
?
Well thats kinda it, if you wanna comment plz do, and criticsm is allowed hehe, this was a kinda short tutorial, but hope it helps, Also remember that having a constants class is discouraged.

A snippet of example where it&#39;s used can be found [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,653826.0.html]here[/url] im still finishing it though.</description>

<p>"I would highly advise against having a single constants class. It may seem a good idea at the time, but when developers refuse to document constants and the class grows to encompass upwards of 500 constants which are all not related to each other at all (being related to entirely different aspects of the application), this generally turns into the constants file being completely unreadable. Instead:</p>
<p>If you have access to Java 5+, use enums to define your specific constants for an application area. All parts of the application area should refer to enums, not constant values, for these constants. You may declare an enum similar to how you declare a class. Enums are perhaps the most (and, arguably, only) useful feature of Java 5+.<br>
If you have constants that are only valid to a particular class or one of its subclasses, declare them as either protected or public and place them on the top class in the hierarchy. This way, the subclasses can access these constant values (and if other classes access them via public, the constants aren’t only valid to a particular class…which means that the external classes using this constant may be too tightly coupled to the class containing the constant)<br>
If you have an interface with behavior defined, but returned values or argument values should be particular, it is perfectly acceptable to define constants on that interface so that other implementers will have access to them. However, avoid creating an interface just to hold constants: it can become just as bad as a class created just to hold constants."[/quote]<br>
I see, thanks man. However, I will stick with one class. It’s way easier in the client development. I’ll make sure to document it or to use enums.</p>

It would depend on what the constant is such as constants that might be used quiet frequently in the project such e.g. the applications name may be acceptable to keep it in it’s own class otherwise just keep the constant in the class that is referencing it.</p>

stuff like FIREMAKING_SKILL_ID shouldn’t be a constant anyways since its related to skills which are most likely all the skills from 0 to 25 something better use a ENUM for that then constant.  Constants are for stuff like GameLoopWaitTimer and ServerPort, ServerName and stuff which you often change in code later on.<br>
[/quote]<br>
… :palm:[/quote]<br>
That seemed like a reasonable post…?</p>
<p>I don’t really remember the convention, but I know I always used constants for stuff I might want to change later (i.e the port, ip, name, whatever) and for things that would actually remain the same no matter the code and the values would be known at compile-time I would use an enum.</p>
<p>It makes sense to use enumeration when all the data types are the same, and constants for arbitrary data types.</p>
<p>ps age doesn’t have much to do with it; I was 15 and very proficient in programming.</p>
