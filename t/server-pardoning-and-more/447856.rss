    <title>Server pardoning and more</title>

    <description>With a lot of changes to the server recently, we&#39;ve gone ahead and done a few more things to help improve Moparcraft. First of all, I&#39;d like to thank you all for your contributions in finding bugs and being understanding while we fixed them. The first thing I&#39;d like to talk about is the server bans, today myself and Zuppers went over the bans and looked at every bodies case and considered whether they should be banned or not. Needless to say, after a few hours of discussion and unbanning we can now confirm a lot of members have been unbanned, to put a number on it, 20 out of the 35 banned members have been unbanned.

I won&#39;t bring in names, but please try to login to find out. Things like this don&#39;t happen very often so if you break the rules this time it is your last chance, many of the members had been banned for more than 4 months. Secondly, I&#39;d like to introduce our first forum moderator: Phaze one (Fuscate) he will be moderating the forum of any rule breaking posts from now on. So congratulations to him ;)

Finally, TNT applications are now opened again. You can apply by posting in this topic:

http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php/topic,536988.msg3926209.html

This is for applying ONLY - No other discussion is to take place as it will be removed. Thanks.</description>
