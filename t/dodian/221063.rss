    <description>Does anybody have a copy of dodian to download? I am just getting back into coding from last summer because i quit during school. Eh, i have like no rep but i am a good coder and i plan to make something good.

Heres a hint of what i may do.

I am a complete metalhead. I plan on making something that involves music into a server which i doubt has ever been done before. so if someone has a copy of dodian please share it ;)

PS. i am starting up again because summer is boring. Every time i go to the mall with my bro&#39;s we get banned because the damn rent a pigs never leave us a lone and it always seems we do illegal things when we hang out. like yesterday me and my friends had some fun with compressed air ;)

^^ that is my life story, don&#39;t be hattin it. ^^</description>
