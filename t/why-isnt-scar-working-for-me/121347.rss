    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-isnt-scar-working-for-me/121347</link>
    <description>FFs some people say i need SCAR 2.3, or 2.2... WELL I CANT GET THAT!... i can only get 3.6 or 3.7 idk!! well i downloaded 3.6, cuz it was the first download on Starblaster100&#39;s Tut.... I have a EssMiner... From Solumn Wishes...

And i got this error.. 

Include file C:\PROGRAM FILES\SCAR 3.06\includes\SSi2.txt does not exist.
Include file C:\PROGRAM FILES\SCAR 3.06\includes\boxbreaker.txt does not exist.
Include file C:\PROGRAM FILES\SCAR 3.06\includes\RedXIIsFordCracker.txt does not exist.
Failed when compiling

^^... now, he/she said i need to download the includes... so i went to file, DOWNLOAD INCLUDES. And so i did... Then, the same problem happened. so i downloaded them again, and overwrote them... And it happened again FFS!!!! Every SCAR SCRIPT I USE, IT ALWAYS.... ALWAYS!!!! HAS AN A ERROR IN IT... People say &quot;Omfg thanks! this works perfectly, tyvm!!!&quot;

&quot;Woot finally, an ess miner that actually works :D&quot;!
