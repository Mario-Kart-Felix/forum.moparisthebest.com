    <title>Can We (MITB Community) Actually Do Something?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-we-mitb-community-actually-do-something/87347</link>
    <description>This is sort of a complaint, but it&#39;s nothing personal or anything.

I just think we should actually be doing something to cheat on RuneScape, like all the other communities. RS-R have ARGA, RSCA have iBot. I think we should be able to put something by our name. 

We have nothing (Other than MoparScape, which to be honest, lots of people hate here) that anyone is doing to actually fulfil this communities purpose. Cheat on RuneScape. 

Many of us were here at Kaitnieks, and used Aryan. 

The only problem is, is the lack of enthusiasm to actually do something. moparisthebest, has actually created a base of a bot, and I understand why he may not to have put time in to a bot like ARGA. I do understand that he has university and a job(?), but there are some amazing people at Java here, and they aren&#39;t doing much RuneScape wise.

I&#39;m not saying I could make a bot, because pretty much, I can&#39;t. There are some keen scripters here, who I&#39;m sure would script for the bot, if we had one. 

I know we have SCAR, but Freddy1990 is the only one who&#39;s really working on it (I know there are a lot of scripters). 

So, what do the Java gurus think. Would you be up to the task of building a bot?</description>

Well thanks I just starting learning java yesterday (I haven’t really done much) so i’ll just read all of those tutorials. And btw I think he was referring to not starting by learning java but more like how would we go about it?</p>

              <p>[quote=“lothy, post:20, topic:87347”]I’ve already outlined my point of view in an IRC conversation with someone - too much talking, not enough doing.</p>
<p>I don’t care about cheating at all really. But I’ll give my opinion anyway - the opinion of someone peeping in through a window from outside.</p>
<p>What I have noticed lately are some people talking themselves up quite a bit, as if they ‘rule the roost’.<br>
Here’s a very good example:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>…believe me, sema is exporing areas in the client that are beyond your comprehension…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Let’s break this remark down: the obvious implication is that someone is inferior to him. What kind of attitude is that towards another member of the community? I don’t know wL personally, so I’ll presume he has two years of Java programming experience. Just two years. That’s nothing when compared to people who have been in the industry for many more years, who have their degrees, and are actually paid.<br>
That would make wL an ‘elitist’ right? I’ll use ‘elitist’ loosely, because chances are he’s nothing more then a sun spot on someone else’s arse.<br>
I don’t like elitists - especially in communities like this, where a majority of users are really just kids. I’d hate to see what would happen to wL if he joined an adult community where the members had been programming for 10 years or so, and were professionals - the first thing that would happen is one would take a pin, and help the person in question deflate their oversized head.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s an important reason for my comments above: When you guys talk like that, you’re blatantly discouraging people. People that read such remarks could be smart, but maybe they’re new. Congratulations, you’ve just made someone feel inferior enough to chuck it in and say ‘bah, forget it - i’ll never be good enough for this lot’.<br>
Just because someone doesn’t know something NOW doesn’t mean they won’t know it later. Who wants to try and learn those things though if you guys are basically kicking them in the stomach before they get the chance to even start?</p>
<p>That example above isn’t attacking wL as a person, it’s simply a great example that really proves my point.</p>
<p>EDIT: After all of the above, I left out an important point. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> There’s no way in the world a person is going to make something and release it if they only predict insults and put-downs - I don’t blame them. Maybe that’s why you see a lack of ‘smart’ people, and a lack of development.[/quote]</p>

              <p>I’ve already outlined my point of view in an IRC conversation with someone - too much talking, not enough doing.</p>
<p>I don’t care about cheating at all really. But I’ll give my opinion anyway - the opinion of someone peeping in through a window from outside.</p>
<p>What I have noticed lately are some people talking themselves up quite a bit, as if they ‘rule the roost’.<br>
Here’s a very good example:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
<img alt width="20" height="20" src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/letter_avatar/wl/40/5_6259e4fa9dfe0dec282fb0955bb1974c.png" class="avatar"> wL:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>…believe me, sema is exporing areas in the client that are beyond your comprehension…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Let’s break this remark down: the obvious implication is that someone is inferior to him. What kind of attitude is that towards another member of the community? I don’t know wL personally, so I’ll presume he has two years of Java programming experience. Just two years. That’s nothing when compared to people who have been in the industry for many more years, who have their degrees, and are actually paid.<br>
That would make wL an ‘elitist’ right? I’ll use ‘elitist’ loosely, because chances are he’s nothing more then a sun spot on someone else’s arse.<br>
I don’t like elitists - especially in communities like this, where a majority of users are really just kids. I’d hate to see what would happen to wL if he joined an adult community where the members had been programming for 10 years or so, and were professionals - the first thing that would happen is one would take a pin, and help the person in question deflate their oversized head.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s an important reason for my comments above: When you guys talk like that, you’re blatantly discouraging people. People that read such remarks could be smart, but maybe they’re new. Congratulations, you’ve just made someone feel inferior enough to chuck it in and say ‘bah, forget it - i’ll never be good enough for this lot’.<br>
Just because someone doesn’t know something NOW doesn’t mean they won’t know it later. Who wants to try and learn those things though if you guys are basically kicking them in the stomach before they get the chance to even start?</p>
<p>That example above isn’t attacking wL as a person, it’s simply a great example that really proves my point.</p>
<p>EDIT: After all of the above, I left out an important point. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> There’s no way in the world a person is going to make something and release it if they only predict insults and put-downs - I don’t blame them. Maybe that’s why you see a lack of ‘smart’ people, and a lack of development.</p>

<p>This was also Taios’s goal, but it didn’t work out to well. The chances of this actually working are slim to none, but we could give it a try. Still, I believe this would create a second “<a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com/smf</a>”, aka hellhole.</p>

              <p>Please don’t take this the wrong way Mr.Chris, I am not talking about you in particular, but the community as a whole.</p>
<p>I believe one of the big problems is this type of thing, expectations for others to make a bot (or <span class="bbcode-i">do something</span>) for the community.  If you want a bot for the community, program it yourself.  I know most of you do not have enough knowledge to write a program as advanced as decent bot system (but to be honest, it isn’t really as hard as it sounds)  But as I tell my brothers when they tell me they don’t know how to do something, that is what learning is for.  Not one person here that knows java (or any other language) was born that way.  Most of them have not even taken any formal classes, taking lots of time to learn from other people’s code and teach themselves.  I suggest to anyone who wants a bot to do the same.</p>
<p>Lastly, I apologize that I haven’t been able to do more, especially recently.  My classes are almost more than I can manage alone, in addition to my job and these forums.  Thankfully though, this week is finals week, so next week I can start to finish a lot of things that have needed to be done for a long time, including reprogramming the forums, and hopefully an updater for Cherokee.</p>

<p>There isn’t enough learning resources available, don’t quote me on that though.</p>
<p>Sure once you know a lot of java you can begin to mess with the client and make stuff, but general client editing bots isn’t going to be done for awhile.</p>
