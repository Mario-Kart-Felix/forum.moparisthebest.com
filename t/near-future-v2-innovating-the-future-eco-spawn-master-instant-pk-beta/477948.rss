Current Age: 17<br>
Past R.S.P.S. Projects/Public Servers: Been playing around here and there.  Moderated in a few, and in one case Co-owned, a moderately successful server.  I’ve met my fair share of corrupt and abusive staff, as well as loyal and mature staff and I can tell the difference between right and wrong (it’s just common sense).  My main reason for playing servers is to PvP and I have become quite capable as a result (I am definitely not the best).<br>
How dependable are you:  I am dependable enough to meet specific deadlines and manage my time accordingly.  I am independent and I don’t rely on others if unnecessary.<br>
How many hours a day can you put into the server:  Weekdays: 2 - 5, Weekends: 2 - 10 (with the exception of work and other mandatory activities)<br>
What time Zone:  GMT +/- 5:00 (Eastern Standard Time)</p>
<p>Assuming that you need a video editor; I record with Camtasia and edit in Sony Vegas Pro 12.  It can take me up to a week’s worth of time to edit a video depending on the length, quality, and amount of ideas going on in my head.  I have experience and confidence in my editing skills.  I can’t show you any proof because my Youtube channel, along with the videos on it, was taken down for copyright infringement.</p>
<p>Edit: The forum doesn’t allow the following BBC tags in your signature: flash, glow, hr, html, img, php, youtube.[/quote]<br>
For some reason, I vouch for this guy.</p>
