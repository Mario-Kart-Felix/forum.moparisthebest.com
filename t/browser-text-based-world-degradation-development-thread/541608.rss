    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/browser-text-based-world-degradation-development-thread/541608</link>
    <description>I have been working on this game for a couple weeks and I&#39;ve made quite a bit of progress, I have been mostly working on the tutorial and setting up the database for the first couple weeks. Also getting all the sprites for monsters, terrain, towns, etc. Here is a quick summary of the game.

(This is lousy of me, but there isn&#39;t a purpose for why your character is set to a town and what not, still working on it.)
Upon creating an account you&#39;ll be put through a tutorial, the tutorial instructor is name Anthony, king of the worlds. He takes you in from being abandoned on the road, in hopes that you will soon become king in his spot, and help him keep the world sane, with other factions trying to attack. The tutorial will help you understand the game (that&#39;s what tutorials are made for, huh?) he will instruct you how to mine and chop trees, and also inform you about land he has allocated to you so that you can start your own faction. The game is based on different decades, starting with 1910-2010. In each decade at various times you will unlock inventions that changed the world, these inventions are available when they were in real history. So in the start, you&#39;re given a wooden pickaxe, and a wooden axe to start your adventures, as well as some resources (gold, wood, stone, moss, etc.) He also allocates you land to start a faction, you are given a ran down town center, and two empty plots. With these plots you can purchase facilities, villages, barracks, etc. For instance if you build a woodcutting facility, and assign 100 workers to it, and the basic level you will get # number of wood per second. This number will change depending on how upgraded the woodcutting facility is, and how many workers you have. With your decade upgrading, (ie. going from 1910 to 1920) you will be able to purchase new weapons, upgrade to new facilities, etc. With your decade upgrading, your town center will also update. Throughout your adventure of upgrading and gathering resources, you will be faced with basic enemies, small threats, or even the king of the underworld, the devil. With fighting these monsters with your built up barracks and army, you will take over land and resources. 

[u]Unlockables[/u]
Most things can be upgraded or purchased with gold. Plots, facilities, citizens, villages, soldiers, etc., can be purchased from the town overview. Items like new swords, bows, arrows, guns, ammo, etc. Can be purchased from the main town shops (I only have two shops made so far.) 
- Purchase new plots with available resources, you start the game with a town center, two empty plots, and 6 unpurchased plots. 
- Purchase facilities for chopping wood, or mining ores, as they will help you get resources faster.

[u]Currently Programmed Into The Game[/u]
[code]- Tutorial to get you started with the game.
- Town overview where you can purchase plots and upgrade facilities.
- Dozens of trees created for the forest.
- Dozens of ores and rocks for the mineshaft.
- Cut scenes white entering mine-shafts, castles, etc.
- Story Line nearly completed.
- 52 Monsters; Including basic monsters, bosses, etc. Names, health, stats, etc have been assigned to monsters.
- Shops (Shops currently hold 10 items each, may be upgraded to 25)
- 34 items; These items have stats, prices, uses, etc.
- 16 Buildings fully programmed; this includes what resources the buildings give, names for the buildings, etc.
- 92 Terrain/World sprites (this includes the images for empty plots, water, forests, etc.)[/code]

[u]Currently Being Worked On/Working on Soon[/u]
[code]- Scripts for purchasing workers, plots, etc.
- Various different counters (I need to add counters at the top for gold, wood, stone, and moss)
- Decade upgrading (A basic button when you have enough resources, it&#39;ll upgrade town centre and unlock more items) 
- More scripts for various other functions.
- The first war (I&#39;m working on programming the script for when you go to war for the first time, will happen after about a week of active playing. Prepare yourself to fight the faction of Caveta.[/code]

[u]Images[/u]
(Nothing special, but I figured I would show at least some progress, ignore the design, I&#39;ll work on that last.)

Second step in the tutorial process - woodcutting (ignore the Runescape graphic, this was before I had my own sprites)

Third step in the tutorial process - results from chopping the tree.

Fourth step, Anthony allocates you some land and tells you where to purchase things.

Final step, visit your town?

More updates and images will be coming soon, stay tuned! I will purchase a web host and domain when I gain support and launch a forums.

[size=18pt][b]Thread Updates[/b][/size]
If you&#39;re interested in helping, the only thing I could use help with is some ideas. Just shoot me some suggestions in a private message, comment, or through Skype: aj.cordio - I can handle all of the web development and the core of the game, but some ideas would be nice. More progress updates coming soon.

<p>Wouldn’t know. I know how to call to JavaScript functions and make the function show or hide a div and alter other HTML elements, but that’s about it. I’ve been wanting to learn more, but haven’t had time to look up on it. More specifically I wanted to learn more about canvas.</p>

<p>Very true, but I’m horrible at JavaScript. On the other hand, I’ve strongly been considering multiplayer. Not full blown multiplayer, but at least a highscores system, and an item trading system for people to trade items with other towns that other players own. And also town shops. But nothing would be player and player interactive.</p>
