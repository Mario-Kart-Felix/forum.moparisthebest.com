    <title>How to make client work for everyone?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-client-work-for-everyone/463256</link>
    <description>Ok so I got my server done but when people download the client and press run it doesnt run because there JDK is different. How can I edit the client so that it runs for everyone who only has jre and not jdk and also jdk? 

Thanks</description>
