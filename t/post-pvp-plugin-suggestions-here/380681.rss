    <title>Post PvP Plugin Suggestions Here</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/post-pvp-plugin-suggestions-here/380681</link>
    <description>After doing a tiny bit of digging, I found the current Bukkit developer release and I am going to start writing the faction plugin for it now. I will outline the basics here, and I encourage people to give suggestions on what to add/change.

The plugin will store faction information in a Sqlite database. (Name, users, wins/losses etc)
Each faction will have an owner, and probably about 2/3 extra staff positions that can be assigned by that owner (suggest names for the staff spots!)
Probably the top two tiers of staff will be able to declare war on a different faction.

[u][b]War[/b][/u]
War will be as follows:
  A staff member of a faction will declare war on a different faction (there must be at least two members of the attacking faction online, and at least one member of the defending faction online)
  A timer (suggest the time amount; probably around 10 minutes) will start, and a message sent to both factions telling them to prepare.
  When the timer expires, another timer starts (again, suggest a time amount) in which the members of both factions are allowed to attack each other. Now, there are two options of what we can do here. We can either have elimination (once you kill all the members of the enemy faction, you win) or a total kill war (try to get more kills than the enemy in total)
  Once that timer is over, each faction has a cool down period (probably around 30 minutes) in which they can&#39;t challenge any other factions, and they can&#39;t be challenged.

[u][b]Other features[/b][/u]
  Faction chat
  Faction stats

Post your ideas!</description>

<p>All players (new and old) who aren’t in a faction are placed in the independent faction.</p>
<p>I got this off your other post and I’m currently too sleepy to think of how to expand it and make it seem like it’d work without complaints.</p>

              <p>[quote=“k0 twin, post:22, topic:380681”]Alright well I’ve been thinking about this and thought of a few possible problems. Here’s a scenario for you:</p>
<p>Let’s say the Akatsuki (Who are known for PvP) have 3 of their members on, and someplace like Haven has 3 members on. The Akatsuki declare war on Haven and Haven is given a warning. What happens if the Haven people just teleport to spawn to avoid fighting. If anyone gets war declared on them and they don’t want to fight they can easily just go hide to avoid fighting. As long as they’re not at their base, how will the invaders find them?[/quote]I also though about this. I think the solution would be having some sort of incentive not to loose, so they want to fight.</p>

              <p>[quote=“k0 twin, post:15, topic:380681”]I really like the idea of having set factions where friendly fire is off between you and your clansmen, but would declaring war on someone be the only way to kill anyone?</p>
<p>Also maybe a command like /inspect  to see what their current faction is and what position they have. So for example if I did<br>
“/inspect moparisthebest”<br>
it would say something like “Viking Raiders Leader”. That would prevent having to color code everyones names or the addition of prefixes, both of which kind of get confusing and messy.[/quote]Here is what I had in mind:<br>
/inspect clanname<br>
Output:</p>
<p><code>
Inspection results for clanname:
  Total members: #
  Leader: _____
  General (or whatever the name is of the staff spot that can declare war):
  Raid wins:
  Raid losses:</code></p>
<p>/inspect playername<br>
Output:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Inspection results for playername:
  Status: In clan/not in clan
  Position (if in clan): Member(not staff)/Staff Position/Leader</code></pre>
<p>I don’t think it’s a good idea to be able to see what clan a normal user may be in, it gives away to much information to other clans.</p>

I was already going to add the spoils of war idea (thought probably make it some random items, not items the enemy chooses) but I don’t really like the ‘specific area’ idea.
