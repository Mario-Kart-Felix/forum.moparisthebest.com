    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/brokenx-v2-source-and-client-please/522467</link>
    <description>i have been looking for a nice source and client and the only one i seem to like at the moment is brokenX V2, v1 has so many bugs that v2 doesn&#39;t and as i am new to coding, less work = less worries.
