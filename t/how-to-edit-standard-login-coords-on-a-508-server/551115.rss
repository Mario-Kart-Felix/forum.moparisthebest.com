    <title>How to edit standard login coords on a 508 server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-edit-standard-login-coords-on-a-508-server/551115</link>
    <description>Hello,

I&#39;m trying to make my own god wars but I keep facing the same problem. If you are in God Wars (height == 2) and log out, and log back in you automatickly login in height 0. Which means that the whole thing is glitched. Can someone here tell me how to fix this problem.

I guess there are 2 options:
1. Making the coords when you login always the same, no matter where you logged out.
2. Making it if you are height 2 and log out, you still login height 2 when you login.

I prefer option 2, but if you only know option 1 its good for me.

Already thanks for reading and hope someone can help me out ;)</description>
