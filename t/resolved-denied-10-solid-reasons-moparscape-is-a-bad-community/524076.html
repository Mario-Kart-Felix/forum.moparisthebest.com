        <p>I’m probably going to get flamed and ridiculed for this post, but if this place is going to get any better, the staff must be aware of the current problems. Many people say this place is better than it has been in a long time, but I disagree. These are 10 reasons I came up with that are controllable and within reason that target actual problems the staff can do things about - not things like “new users can’t use the search button and see their question on making them admin has been answered thousands of times”.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>
<p>There are 10 listable reasons this community is bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It favors veterans. Now this is tolerable, because veterans are what made the whole scene possible, but they can bend the rules and get away with things other people cannot. Look at my posts and tell me I’m not breaking the rule against flaming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Important topics are out-dated and may not apply. Look at Moparisthebest’s offer on buying programs. I really don’t think this is still going on, and even if it is, how would I know? It’s very hard to contact him, yet it remains a sticky and brings confusion among members who may be interested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are no clearly-established goals, yet everyone seems to be striving towards one thing or the other. Is this community centered towards private servers? I don’t think so. Then why is it called “the mother of RS private servers”?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moparisthebest, or MoparScape? Both communities exist, but they’re essentially the same community. Obviously there are more veterans and intelligent people who prefer Moparisthebest and think this side is a pile of shit, but it seems all the activity is over here. If I was new, I wouldn’t know whether to post on here or over there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>None of the members are constructive and they make insulting or being negative towards the OP their main goal. Now I’ll be the first to admit I do this. I don’t like seeing topics that can be answered by using Google, but this doesn’t give me the right to call the OP a lazy moron.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The advertisement section is horribly moderated. But it’s a hard job and Flame_ is still the best addition to the team. Pretty much everything good in there is because of him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The homepage can’t even be accessed from the forums without finding the topic that announces it. What the fudge? The homepage was a step in the right direction towards giving people a chance to shine, but again, none of the staff actually followed through with it. Ruby and I had ideas to feature content on it, but how would people read it if they don’t even know it exists…?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Badges aren’t given out enough because the staff (Tom…) are afraid of what they’ll do, like stop helping people if they got a helper badge or become arrogant and penisy. I have a C# guru badge - I don’t laugh at people when they try to write C#. I encourage them to do so and help in the ways I can simply because I like C#.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of the administrators are lazy and careless - when it comes to the site. Moparisthebest isn’t really included in this because what he’s done is remarkable - especially after all of these years. I listed a few reasons why Taharok and Tom are <span class="bbcode-i">currently</span> bad choices <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,636854.msg4327347.html#msg4327347" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. Taharok is too busy with college and real life, and I don’t know what Tom is doing. I have a hard time contacting him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This sort of goes against what I said in the original post since it’s geared towards everyone’s feelings, but it’s the most important reason and it needs to change. Everyone is careless about the community. “It’s going to die”, “The site is dead”, “RuneScape sucks and nobody gives a shit about RSPS anymore”, etc… This attitude spreads and makes it very difficult for anyone to try and make a difference. People who do get shot down and there isn’t any uphill. In fact, there hasn’t really been in a long time. When Taharok became admin, he created a few boards and fixed some issues, but this only caters to issue 7. When members need help, they’ll join the IRC, but because of people like me, drubrkletern, casey, and a couple others (hey, how does it feels to have tire marks on your backs? :P) they won’t get help. They get trolled hard and then leave - probably to go to a better site like Rune Server.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So let’s try to solve them. Get better staff that care and are on top of things. This helps fix issues 10, 9, 5, 4, 2, and some of 3. Enforce <span class="bbcode-b">all</span> the rules unconditionally and don’t let people just be negative. This will help issues 6 and 1 the most. Make a list of clear established goals! We can’t want flaming and trolling to stop, but let people like Silabsoft (who rarely posts anyway, and not to put a target on her back but she’s one of the biggest people I can think of who still posts and is too respected to be touched) get away with posting whatever she wants. She’s a legend and we wouldn’t be here without her, but letting her get away with everything goes back to number 10. Addressing this issue would help fix 8 and 1. Number 7 is a problem on its own, but it goes back to issue 8 and just making changes without clearly striving towards a vision.</p>
<p>There you have it. Find some people who really know what they’re doing and care to improve this place and maybe we can actually get back in the scene or be on the <span class="bbcode-b">first or second</span> Google search result page for “runescape private server”. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I completely agree with <span class="hashtag">#10</span>. I think it’s pretty retarded that someone like Silab(no offense to you, Silab. You’re just the first one that comes to my mind) can go around doing whatever the love she wants, while I get punished for something remotely close.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have no opinion about this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The forums don’t necessarily encourage posting in the RSPS development boards, considering they’re near the bottom. This is a RSPS community. The rsps dev boards don’t need to be at the top, but why is it near the bottom?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uhm… okay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kinda brings me back to <span class="hashtag">#10</span>, but, I try to post a constructive comment whenever I can. But a lot of the threads being created are just stupid, I think as a community we need to be more tolerate of these types of threads, a lot of these people are new to the rsps scene.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taharok knew the board was going to be problematic when he made it, and as a result he promoted some new moderators, but it seems almost like they’ve all gone inactive, or just visit a lot less. Maybe we need some type of approval system going.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>100% agree, fix this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t want to see someone with a badge every other post, but people getting appreciated for their contributions and effort would be nice to see.</p>
</li>

<p>Demote Tom and promote asshole_rule to admin</p>

It's very hard to contact him, yet it remains a sticky and brings confusion among members who may be interested.</blockquote>
<p>I do agree. Everything needs to be redone or touched up.<br>
It feels stale and makes the staff seem disconnected from the member base.</p>
<blockquote>8. There are no clearly-established goals, yet everyone seems to be striving towards one thing or the other. Is this community centered towards private servers? I don't think so. Then why is it called "the mother of RS private servers"?</blockquote>
<p>What do you suggest our goal be though? The most traffic is gained from 14 year olds looking up private servers or runescape cheats. Sadly, we do neither too well anymore. We were the mother, now we’re the old widow who shits herself.</p>
<blockquote>7. Moparisthebest, or MoparScape? Both communities exist, but they're essentially the same community.

<p>This one is simple. Make the mitb forum password protected (and hidden/private) and only allow certain individuals inside Members can apply to become part of the exclusive group and contributions can become more focused. Plus, it’ll give people something to aim for and I do believe contributions will rise.</p>
<blockquote>6. None of the members are constructive and they make insulting or being negative towards the OP their main goal. Now I'll be the first to admit I do this. I don't like seeing topics that can be answered by using Google, but this doesn't give me the right to call the OP a lazy moron.</blockquote>
<p>This community should NOT become a spoonfeeding community. We shouldn’t provide the information that they should find themselves. However, we should work harder on pointing them in the direction of the resources.</p>
<blockquote>5. The advertisement section is horribly moderated. But it's a hard job and Flame_ is still the best addition to the team. Pretty much everything good in there is because of him.</blockquote>
<p>Staff overhaul based on activity. Something that has never been done here.</p>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<p>I think everyone knows my view on this.</p>

Moparisthebest isn't really included in this because what he's done is remarkable - especially after all of these years. I listed a few reasons why Taharok and Tom are currently bad choices here. Taharok is too busy with college and real life, and I don't know what Tom is doing. I have a hard time contacting him.</blockquote>
<p>Tom is reasonable. Taharok is talented. We do need someone additional that can fill the void that Mopar’s inactivity has made.<br>
Sythe does this very well.</p>

<p>You’ve proved your capabilities as well as other members if have earned them.  Badges are still flawed though. I nominated someone two weeks ago for one who has nothing but shown what the award represents for an ample amount of time, and I doubt they will ever get the award. I won’t even go into vet/cm because those are broken ranks.[/quote]<br>
Mind sharing who it is again? It may have been overlooked.</p>
<p>This thread is quite interesting, and there are a few standout issues that can and need to be resolved that were mentioned.</p>

May I recommend that you actually submit the content, and then worry about who reads it after? I agree that the homepage needs to be made more accessible, so hopefully we can get that worked out.

        <p>I was behind the ‘scenes’ for what 6 months? From what I experienced as a staff member for 6 months was bullshit (no offense guys). The staff section isn’t motivated at all, we basically encourage staff members to become inactive, and the important problems in the staff section get shoved under the carpet. Most of staff here have been absent from anything RuneScape-related for many years, so they never view any of the RuneScape related material, aren’t we supposed to get moderators who are actively in the scene so they can give appropriate feedback?</p>
<p>When I came onto the moderation team I felt like I could make a change (I’m sure that’s how Davidi2 felt too) but after months of trying ideas, you realize that the administration team is too stuck up to listen to any ideas about change. Taharok was doing a good job until real life bit him in the butt and I don’t think Tom was the guy to add onto the administration team.</p>
<p>The way we treat veteran’s here is RIDICULOUS, I’ve seen it countless times where a Moparian get infracted in one thread and another VETERAN comes and does the same thing and gets away with it.</p>
<p>And giving community member to like 5 people, when there were 15+ people worthy of the recognition, what happened with that? So many ideas get started here and no one can carry them out.</p>
<p>Thanks for the post Lin, it’s much needed.</p>

        <p>Hmm… I’m thoroughly read all of these “complaints” or informative reasons and I like them all and agree to all of them. I will say that SOME changes have been made to MSCP but I think we need a lot more. There are plenty of suggestions in this board.</p>
<p>As for the things that were started and never finished - I have to agree with that as well 100 percent. If the homepage for example wasn’t going to go through all the way the way it should have then the administration or whoever was working on it should have simply made a simple homepage (as if we were a RSPS itself) so we didn’t have to do the blog stuff. It would be at least better than what we’re doing now since not much is going on with it.</p>
<p>And I’m guessing you’ve resigned?</p>

        <p>What I’m doing is what every other administrator who has the time is doing, turning up to staff discussions and talking about what is brought up in the staff section and here. I’ve personally turned up to every single staff meeting since they started happening again many months ago, and sat there until 5AM in the morning when I have to be up at 7AM just so the American staff could get a favourable time because they’re the majority. You seem to have the idea in your head that the poster of the announcement topic is the sole advocate of the change, which has never been the case. We explicitly work as a team, and if not all the time the administrators consult each other before making a change even if agreed upon by staff.</p>
<p>Give it a rest with the “Tom is on the wrong track”, “Taharok is on the right track” there is no individualistic pursuits that aren’t registered with the staff team, or the other admins. Perhaps you would be more successful on the IRC by talking to me on an even level (like everyone else, who hey, gets a response!), rather than ensuing an ever lasting need for dominance throughout “your” channel.</p>

<p>I was behind the ‘scenes’ for what 6 months? From what I experienced as a staff member for 6 months was bullshit (no offense guys). The staff section isn’t motivated at all, we basically encourage staff members to become inactive, and the important problems in the staff section get shoved under the carpet.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>How do we encourage staff to become inactive? Because we refuse to force them into working, because we don’t stand there with a whip demanding they solve more reports or we’ll demote them. I cannot recall a single problem that’s major that has been shoved under the carpet (or hell, any problem that’s on the agenda at all), if by shoved under the carpet you mean unresolved because of on going debate then OK. I’d rather have a proper discussion about major topics than rush to the finish line just to create the idea we’re making all this change to please people like Lin.</p>
<p>Each administrator (Moparisthebest included with a child, and a full time job) sits on that IRC and on this forum for a ridiculous amount of time. I’ve responded to everything you sent me even when I was a mod, and even spoke to the other staff about your suggestions (like Davidi2) and you have the audacity to post here proclaim I’m stuck up and don’t care about change. Perhaps if your suggestions didn’t chime to the rhythm of “delete all of the forum and start again” you’d have had more luck getting it done. You are a populist.</p>
<p>The proposition that a large portion of the staff should be removed is not going to happen, the forum is aware of the stance when dealing with situations like this and this topic is in breach of the vision of this section, and the global forum rules. On an ending note, I can assure you we still regularly attend staff discussion and as even Davidi2 (considering he’s the lead example for an ex-staff member now :P) can recall that our staff discussion can be very comprehensive, and long and concurrently attended by staff who are interested in an IRC meeting.</p>
<p>I would like to say that I do want to revitalize the posts by staff in this section. While we have discussed a lot of the issues that have been posted, every topic deserves a detailed response so no confusion is met (or wrong impressions). This is something that will be dealt with tonight within the coming hours, and we will re evaluate anything that might have changed with older suggestions that stopped us from doing them and also post that. This isn’t me who’s doing this, everything you see is a team effort from a good team who are willing to use their free time to work with this community. On top of that I will link this topic for the other administrators to see, and attending staff and discuss the points that have been raised but this is not a suggestion topic, this is a poorly informed rant.</p>
