    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-start-a-server/377884</link>
    <description>[b]Hello [/b] 

I saw all your source and client, and have played some different Rspa servers. so wherever I want to do your own server. 
I have downloaded many different server + Client. But they may not work. 
When I have downloaded it and andvänt Winarr. 
and go into the folder, and click on RUN it says the path can not be found. 
may not address the Client or anything just a black box with white lettering path can not be found .... 
I have Windows 7. are no problems with getting the work out to where? 

please can somebody help me to get under way and send a functioning source of Client. 
Thanks in mockery :)</description>

              <p>kk im not being rude im just analyzing ur problem and giving u some solution’s instead of un helpful people commenting 1 word ^^</p>
<ol>
<li>Class cannot be found means ur Paths havent been set u needa set them im hoping u have got JDK installed <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> if u do have it installed it would be in u c drive go my computer &gt; c drive &gt; program files &gt; Java &gt; now you shud see text that looks like this jdk1.6.0_22 &lt;- the file name the last number u MUST take note of. now lets go back 2 either ur compiler or RUN batch file &gt; right click edit now it SHOULD look like this in ur compiler</li>

cd Source<br>
“C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_<span class="bbcode-b">22</span>\Bin\javac.exe” -cp . -d ./Bin/ ./*java<br>
pause</p>
<p>Notice something Similar? yes its displaying the path to find ur java <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> now u needa change the back number to the current version u have so if i had 23 and in this bat file it says 22 i would change it to 23 <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> now it shud be fixed and u may now continue ur work <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> if not go step 2 <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>U havent downloded Java and ur paths are not set heres a quick way of how to fix the paths</li>
</ol>
<p>so, your going to need JDK (java development kit) can be downloaded from this website: <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp" rel="nofollow noopener">http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp</a></p>
<p>now you should have it installed…</p>
<p>Environmental variables are what allows you to run your server with Java, without it you would simple get ‘The path is not yet specified’ so this is an extremely important step. We will firstly open ‘My Computer’ and click ‘View System Information’. As you do this, a small applet displaying several tabs, and you will select the one that says ‘Advanced’ and at the bottom, click ‘Environmental Variables’. Now what you’re going to do, is go to your ‘Path’ and ‘Classpath’ variables and edit them.</p>
<p>In your Classpath variable, you’re going to take everything currently inside it and edit it with your latest version of JDK, so right now it would be;</p>
<p>CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_11\bin;%CLASSPATH%;<br>
Though if a newer version comes out, you would change the ‘jdk1.6.0_11’ to the newest version.</p>
<p>After you have done the Classpath variable, you’re going to find the Path variable and add the code below inside it.</p>
<p>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_11\bin;<br>
The same goes for Path, if you download a newer version of JDK then you’re going to change the ‘jdk1.6.0_11’ to your current version.</p>
<p>God i have hoped ive helped i remember when i first came and every1 wud write me 10 words for help or show me a link and id get completely thrown off my objective &gt;.&lt;</p>
