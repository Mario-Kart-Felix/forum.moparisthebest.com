    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/purep2p-formally-known-as-project-p2p-revival-project/371430</link>
    <description>I know it has been some time but we where having problems with our server. But after all our hard work and effort we have finally fixed all our problems and where back up and running.

So lets begin,

Pure P2P Formally Project P2P Revival Project (Had to change name due to forum posting issues.)

What we are trying to attempt is to recreate an RSC original from the old pp2p source.
I know it needs alot of work and most of you may think it has flaws.

This is only an attempt on my part to recreate what i thought was once a great server.
I know that it will never add up to RSCE or RSCA or even some of the other good servers out there but at least i am willing to try.

[b]For those of you who registered before your usernames and accounts have remained intacted. Please use the names you originally registered with. No Rollbacks have been performed.[/b]

Come check us out!!

PS. I originally started this server so that a few friends and i could have something to do on our days off. It may seem a little lame at first but i am trying to work on it as much as possible.

Pic&#39;s will be uploaded later.
More Content and updates to come.
