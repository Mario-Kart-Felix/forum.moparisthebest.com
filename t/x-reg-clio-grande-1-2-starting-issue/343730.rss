    <title>X Reg Clio grande 1.2 starting issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/x-reg-clio-grande-1-2-starting-issue/343730</link>
    <description>So yeah, started on fixing up my old car since it&#39;s basically a wreck.

Battery is fine, swapped it over to another car of mine and ran it up. tried the other cars battery on the clio and it didn&#39;t even spin the starter.

Checked the cables going to the starter solonoid (usually on clios its got a problem with the white going in and usually needs switch cleaner) so i sanded it down and put switch cleaner on it but yet again fuck all happened.

Tried bumping, jumping and these are to no avail - just ripped out the starter and am going to get another in a while for it - was thinking alternator but i&#39;ll check that one out after the starter, also maybe it&#39;s the key fob - people who are used to clios could be aware that if the key fob battery runs low then the immobiliser just fucks the cars starting up.

<p>Exactly, he has checked whether the battery has enough charge, he has checked the fuses.  He needs to check the starter itself as per my instructions. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>if its none of those, check the fuel is being supplied to the engine cylinders.</p>

You can take the starter to an auto parts store and have it checked for free, around here anyway.  If you can’t you can CAREFULLY do it with a set of jumper cables hooked up to the battery, but the ground cable on the starter housing, the positive cable on the solenoid where the positive cable would go on a car, then using a screwdriver or something else jump between the two terminals on the solenoid (the big one where the cable is attached and the much smaller, actuator one.</p>
<p>If it runs, the solenoid and starter are good.  If it doesn’t, bypass the solenoid by removing the positive cable from it, and touching it to the wire or strap that goes from the solenoid directly into the starter.  If the starter runs then the solenoid is bad, if it doesn’t the starter is bad.</p>
<p>If the starter is good, then you have a cable problem, a switch problem, or if the car is so equipped some fancy computer stopping it from turning over.  The first thing you should check regardless is for blown fuses, it’s obvious but easily overlooked, we have all done it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

<p>Checked the fuses first, and as I said usually with the renault key fob if it’s running low on battery the immobiliser doesn’t allow the engine to run.</p>

You don’t have to strip it, just check the starter like I said with jumper cables.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/ollie">@ollie</a>, if it isn’t turning over then spark plugs can’t be the problem.</p>

              <p>So yeah, started on fixing up my old car since it’s basically a wreck.</p>
<p>Battery is fine, swapped it over to another car of mine and ran it up. tried the other cars battery on the clio and it didn’t even spin the starter.</p>
<p>Checked the cables going to the starter solonoid (usually on clios its got a problem with the white going in and usually needs switch cleaner) so i sanded it down and put switch cleaner on it but yet again fuck all happened.</p>
<p>Tried bumping, jumping and these are to no avail - just ripped out the starter and am going to get another in a while for it - was thinking alternator but i’ll check that one out after the starter, also maybe it’s the key fob - people who are used to clios could be aware that if the key fob battery runs low then the immobiliser just fucks the cars starting up.</p>
<p>x x x ideas x x x do it x x x</p>
