    <title>Issue with Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/issue-with-client/267758</link>
    <description>I Downloaded a source and have a couple clients to run it.

They&#39;re 317.

Both Clients, when I run them comes up with errors about java, too much to type.

It says this inside the &quot;Run&quot;

[code]@echo off
TITLE Run
JAVA -Xmx500m client 0 0 highmem members 0
pause[/code]

Is there anything else I can do to this Batch files to may em work?

I&#39;m not a huge expert on this.</description>

              <p>Your java path and class path is set incorrectly, here is a guide on how to fix this problem.</p>
<p>NOTE: change 1.6.0 to whatever version you have, and if your java is on a different hard drive, you can change it as well.</p>
<p>Go to your system information and go to advanced, then go to environmental variables.</p>
<p>Ok now find the variable called “path” in the list in that new screen open. Rename it to “PATH” and then for<br>
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0\bin\</p>
<p>Now make a new variable under SYSTEM VARIABLES called CLASSPATH Now add this in for it’s value:<br>
C:\Program Files\Java\Java\jdk1.6.0\bin\</p>
