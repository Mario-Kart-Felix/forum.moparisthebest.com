    <title>Question: How do you make shops in a 525?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-how-do-you-make-shops-in-a-525/355705</link>
    <description>[quote=&quot;ghostly150, post:1, topic:355318&quot;]I found this 525 source and client I want to use but it didn&#39;t have any shops in it and I am fairly new to 525&#39;s. I was wondering if anyone could point me to a tutorial or something...? I&#39;ve spent at least two days altogether searching (not 2 days straight but its just to show the point). So could anyone please help with this? It would help a LOT! :) ;)

Thank you,
Ghostly150
