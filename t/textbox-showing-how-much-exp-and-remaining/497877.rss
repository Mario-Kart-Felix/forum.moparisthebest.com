    <description>Hello reader

I was wondering, on the server I am currently working on, it doesn&#39;t show any textboxes with how much exp you currently have and how much you need for the next level. Any fixes on this? I tried looking at the RSInterface.java, but don&#39;t exactly know where to start looking... This is all kinda new to me, but I&#39;m willing to learn, so you might hear lots from me :)</description>

You mean correctly working tooltips, correct? When you hover over the skills in the skills tab?<br>
[/quote]Yes indeed.[/quote]<br>
You’re better off just completely re-adding your skill tab, due to most people not including that in their tutorials.</p>
