    <title>Help Need - 474 Server / Run Issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-need-474-server-run-issues/543361</link>
    <description>Hello, 
I am currently having issues with my 474 Private Server. I just recently downloaded the frame/base from &#39;arham 4&#39;. It is called World 901. I have the World 901 Client folder, as well as the World 901 Server folder. I have experience with creating / building rsps&#39;s. With this one I cannot find out how to run the server, or in other words play the game. I cannot find any server-ip in the client.java file. I am just really struggling with getting the server to run / be playable to just me. I have yet to even get the game to load up. Somebody please help me  :). I would put screenshots in but I don&#39;t know how lol.
