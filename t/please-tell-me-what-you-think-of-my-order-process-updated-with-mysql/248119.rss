    <title>Please tell me what you think of my Order Process - UPDATED WITH MYSQL</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/please-tell-me-what-you-think-of-my-order-process-updated-with-mysql/248119</link>
    <description>UPDATE: I&#39;m working on it so its probably going to show a lot of errors, that why I remove the link.

UPDATE: Ive added [url=http://workingonthis]http://www.wiebelhausdesign.com/names.php[/url] Ive added a place where I can see what people have entered so I dont have to do a script to email myself, obviosuly I will password protect it. Please test my mysql injection, I need to make sure it works. Obviously this is going to be funny because people are going to type some weird shit into it. Just use order.php and go to names.php. Please tell me if it works.


I have finished most of my site, I just converter it to php, if you want to mean what I mean by converted I mean I made certain objects separate like navigation.php so all i had to do was require it to show which will allow me to change it and it will effect all the pages.

I want everyone to test out the Order Link, its basic, doesn&#39;t send me an email so don&#39;t worry, I haven&#39;t got that far, it just says it did.

Please test it and tell me your thoughts.[/url]

No comments about rounded edges please.

Here is my code for process.php

Ty wraud for the safe_output function
[code]
&lt;?php
$servicetype = $_POST[&#39;servicetype&#39;];
$name = $_POST[&#39;name&#39;];
$email = $_POST[&#39;email&#39;];

function safe_output($string) {
    $string = trim($string);
    $string = strip_tags($string);
    $string = htmlspecialchars($string);

       return $string;
}
echo &quot;Thank you &quot; .safe_output($name). &quot; for inquring about &quot;.safe_output($servicetype).&quot; &lt;br/&gt;an email has been sent to &quot;.safe_output($email).&quot;&lt;br/&gt; and I will email you back as soon so possible.&quot;;

<p>I have finished most of my site, I just converter it to php, if you want to mean what I mean by converted I mean I made certain objects separate like navigation.php so all i had to do was require it to show which will allow me to change it and it will effect all the pages.</p>
<p>I want everyone to test out the Order Link, its basic, doesn’t send me an email so don’t worry, I haven’t got that far, it just says it did.</p>
