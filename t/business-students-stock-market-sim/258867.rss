    <title>Business Students - Stock market sim</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/business-students-stock-market-sim/258867</link>
    <description>Anyone who is currently studying business now, or intends to, this is a great simulator to help understand how the markets change, and how to recognize different trends. Really does add that extra bit of knowledge. Pretty fun as well. Free to use, and a good community.
