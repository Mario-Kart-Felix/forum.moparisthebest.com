&lt;blockquote&gt;A horde of decaying zombies invaded San Francisco&#39;s downtown Apple store on Friday evening, hunting for brains, terrifying the customers, and gnawing on iMacs.

I&#39;ve placed some photos here. I&#39;m pleased to report that the zombies ultimately decided human brains were tastier than plastic iMacs, although it wasn&#39;t for lack of effort in trying to vary what must be a monotonous diet.

It was difficult to judge the exact number of zombies that shuffled through the city&#39;s shopping district, losing limbs, blood, and unmentionable body parts along the way, but probably at least 150 converged on Union Square. Then they decided to visit nearby businesses, including the Apple store, Nordstrom, the Disney store, and the Westfield Mall.

The event was titled &quot;SF Zombie Mob 2007,&quot; and it was organized by the gruesome-minded folks at eatbrains.com. It&#39;s akin to a flash mob, though because the participants trek around the city after gathering, the Zombie Mob was closer in concept to the Critical Mass bicycle ride, which coincidentally was happening at the same time along the same street. In truth, it was a pretty polite affair: only passers-by who volunteered to become zombie-fied were, and no arrests took place.

It may be worth noting that the Westfield Mall and Disney security tried to bar the zombies from entering, but Apple store security did not. In fact, salespeople were jostling one another for a position where they could take the best photo of the zombies (or themselves with the zombies, or their brains being eaten by the zombies).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You have to love people that organize these types of things.  :P</description>
