    <title>[Fast] Building websites cheep [Fast]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fast-building-websites-cheep-fast/478792</link>
    <description>Im using my knowledgeable of JavaScript XHTML5, PHP, and MySQL to build sites for people at a cheep price (read note below)
webpages dont have to be RS Themed if requested, i also do custom forums (software built from scratch) user systems ect
if interested, PM me or add me on skype: exotiicdeath

I will not discus a price on moparscape as the rules say we cant sell anything over there forum, so il have to message you via a 3rd party application (e.g skype)

*Please note, all packages do not come with there own hosting or domain, i will only provide the design &amp; code</description>

<p>are you reading my posts correctly? obviously im wanting a payment, but if you read the rules you will find that no transaction is allowed on Moparscape and all help is to be given free of charge, now that’s MOPARSCAPES ToS, if someone add’s me on skype and we discuss a payment that’s NOTHING to do with Moparscape… and if we re-call my thread you will see that im not making a transaction im just enquiring if anyone would be interested. if you want to stop scenarios like this i would suggest updating your ToS again because im doing nothing wrong here according to the rules.[/quote]<br>
I think you’ll find you’re more or less following the loopholes in the rules themselves where as the foreword in the rules clearly states:</p>
<aside class="quote">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 Foreword:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>The staff reserve the right to interpret these rules any way they see fit. The following rules are more like guidelines. You shouldn’t be looking for loopholes in them, rather, you should just get along with them. We’re looking for users that use common sense. For example, we would prefer a user that knows, just because something isn’t on the rules, that it it isn’t necessarily allowed</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m not here to be a dick, I myself used to freelance a lot and it was hard to get your name out there. However, I really don’t think this is the place.</p>

<p>P.S i removed the payment part as i remembered that i couldn’t sell anything on here… not because i was trying to hide anything, as i state quite clearly we would negotiate on skype</p>
