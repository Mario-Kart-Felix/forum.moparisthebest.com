SiriusX is back!
[KompressedX]

Website

Welcome to KompressedX V2 running the official SiriusX source that we all loved! 
Currently in beta mode now is your chance to train whilst in double exp and double drops!
Unfortunately the player files could not be restored so everyone will have to start again which is why you should play now and get a headstart!
The only things that have been changed in this source is bugs Jesper never got round to fixing!
You&#39;ll be delighted to hear that alot of legendary players have already been invited back to this server and have been playing for around 2 weeks including Slash, Toxicity, Platinum, Jamie, Evil Yoda and many more!
Staff positions are open as of 11/23/13

What features do we offer in KompressedX [SiriusX] ?

PestControl (All modes, easy, med, hard).
Player Customization (It also saves and you won&#39;t have to change your character everytime you login).
Completionist Reqs.
Dominion Tower (Gain dominion weapons, they cannot be used in PvP).
Godwars (All monsters and minions works, we have added killcounts but it&#39;s disabled till the areas gets crowded).
Bork (It respawns every hour and it&#39;s Completionist Cape req).
Polypore Dungeon (The only and easiest way to gain Ganodermic and Fungal).
PvM points, gain points and buy items used in PvM.
Tormneted Demons.
Gilded Altar.
Fight Kiln and Fight Caves.
Glacors with all minions working and fire spell weekness.
Fairy Ring (You can teleport to Glacor VIA code: DKQ and there&#39;s also a teleport to Ice strykewyrms).
Barrows with decent barrows droprate.
Corporeal Beast with no safespots or bugs.
Dungeoneering with decent XP and tokens gain.
Recipe for Diaster (Gain barrows gloves here).
Loyalty Points and Shop.
Duel Arena with Staking.
Squeal of Fortune with no bugs and daily spins.
ClanWars.
Jadinko lair.
