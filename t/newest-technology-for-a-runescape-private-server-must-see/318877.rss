    <description>Ok I have been working on this server now since 2003! I have made it completely custome! now you can control ur character with the arrow keys, &quot;a&quot; is to switch between ur spells, &quot;s&quot; is to do various commands such as picking up items, &quot;z&quot; is to activate the selected spell, and &quot;x&quot; is to attack with melee weapons. I am not completely done with it yet, but i think by christmas it should be done. here are some pix. I will be adding more pix and info as soon as i can!
