    <description>I purchased a VPS to run a server on that I&#39;ve been messing around with, I changed the ip in the client (client.java) to the IP of the VPS, and now it doesn&#39;t work? The client doesn&#39;t even load, it just says &#39;error connecting trying in 5.&#39; 
I&#39;ve tried using 3 different clients all 317 clients, none of them seem to let me login the server if it&#39;s going to my VPS&#39;s IP. But when I try them on my original IP Address it works on all 3 clients =\


My windows firewall is off, aswell as ports forwarded automatically.

Anyone able to help?</description>
