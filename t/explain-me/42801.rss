    <title>Explain Me</title>

    <description>Hi, I&#39;m brand new to these forums and I&#39;ve been reading around a lot. I was curious if someone can explain to me how SRL and SCAR work and why you need both. I remember using SCAR before (from kaitneks). I had to select the screen and then the script would move the mouse for me. Is this the same idea? If yes, then what is SRL for? Thanks for any help.

btw. When I look for scripts, do I wanna look under SCAR scripts or SRL scripts???</description>

              <p>Yup, SCAR is exactly the same as always, controlling your mouse and keyborad to play RS for you.</p>
<p>SRL = SCAR Resuorces Library.  A set of includes with predefined functions to make scripting easier, and autoing for longer a huge possibility.  You need SRL because most scripts use SRL now-a-days due to the advanced antirandoms, antiban and new procedures widely available.</p>
