    <title>Need a little help from everyone :D</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-little-help-from-everyone-d/121879</link>
    <description>Ok I am really bored and don&#39;t have more than 1/10 knowledge when coding comes about. I would really love it if someone did me this HUGE favor.
I decided to make mod and admin looks.(I&#39;ll add my own personal look later)
I would like these to be for mods:
1057
1725
2414
4087
3842
3140
2417
2489
4107
so only MODS and,also, the character named &#39;Adminscape&#39; can wear them

I would like these for be for admins:
1053
1729
2413
1099
3844
6654
2516
1065
2577
so only ADMINS and,also, the character named &#39;Adminscape&#39; can wear them

Thank you very much!!
Also muchly appreciated if you tell me where I should put these(I know the file :P)</description>

              <p>why should normal users disconnect? whats the point normal users can’t play or something?</p>
<p>and with that code everytime a admin or mod logs in he gets that equippment even if he drops it… he relogs and gets it back wearing? and it is simple.</p>

              <p>hmm…i just wanted to make it simple, like if your character rights don’t equal 1 or 2, you disconnect, and can ONLY wear if those are your character rights</p>

              <p>those are equipped items?  … well</p>
<p>look at client.java  for the player loading part something similiar to this… it looks like</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(readSave() != 3 &amp;&amp; checkbannedusers() != 5 &amp;&amp; checkbannedips() != 5) {
loadmoreinfo();
loadquestinterface();
RefreshSummonBook();
loadweather();
appendConnected();
loggedinpm();
updatePlayers();</code></pre>
<p>if yours dont look like that don’t make it look the same or it wont work anyways…</p>
<p>add under it.</p>
<p><code>
if(playerRights == ##(FORGOT ADMIN number put here)##){
//admin looks (edit it up)
        // Giving the player an unique look
        playerEquipment[playerHat]    = 2581;

        playerEquipment[playerRing]   = 6735;
        playerEquipment[playerArrows] = -1;
        playerEquipment[playerWeapon] = 4151;
} else if(playerRights == ##(FORGOT MOD number put here)##){

        playerEquipment[playerArrows] = -1;
        playerEquipment[playerWeapon] = 4151;
}</code></p>
<p>I forgot how mods or admins number… for playerRights you put it in also edit all the stating gear I couldn’t be assed lol u kno what to do anyways…</p>
<p>as for Adminscape i could add it in the IF’s but it would be hard to figure out if Adminscape was admin or mod :S just edit his playerRights in char file to any of the ones that fit the equipment</p>
