<p>Only when it is. These designs are very basic. If he wants to make money in photoshop he will need alot more practice. I took photoshop in college and had to re-create a entire landscape photo by scratch. It took around 40 hours (very intricate picture I chose). That picture had around 200 colors, and around 300 (or so) layers. Professionals can probably do this in minutes, along with any other photshop savy person.<br>

<p>thats nice, but the topic isnt about you.<br>
its one thing to tell him he needs to improve, another thing to laugh at him and cut him down. and no one really “cut hims down” yet, but i know it will happen. and nothing is ever WORTHLESS. just because you would say it is, others might not. as long as he is putting max effort into, and he doesn’t think its worthless. it has some worth. maybe not alot, but its better then none.[/quote]</p>
<p>You just wrote a rant about something that hasn’t yet happened.</p>

He’s trying to make money by putting in almost no effort. The images are really not worth anything, therefor worthless.</p>
