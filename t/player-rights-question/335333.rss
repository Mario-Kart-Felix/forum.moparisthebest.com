    <title>Player Rights Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-rights-question/335333</link>
    <description>Ok, this is what i want to happen.  
[code]if(command.startsWith(&quot;yell&quot;) &amp;&amp; command.length() &gt; 5) {
if (playerRights == 0) {
if(member == 0) {
yell(&quot;[Player] &quot;+playerName+&quot;:  &quot;+ command.substring(5));
}
}
if (playerRights == 1){
yell(&quot;[Member] &quot;+playerName+&quot;:  &quot;+ command.substring(5));
}
if (playerRights == 2) {
yell(&quot;[Mod] &quot;+playerName+&quot;:  &quot;+ command.substring(5));
}
if (playerRights == 3) {
yell(&quot;[Admin] &quot;+playerName+&quot;:  &quot;+ command.substring(5));
}
if (playerRights == 4) {
yell(&quot;[Co Owner] &quot;+playerName+&quot;:  &quot;+ command.substring(5));
}
if (playerRights == 5) {
yell(&quot;[Owner] &quot;+playerName+&quot;:  &quot;+ command.substring(5));
}
}
	else if (muted) {
	sM(&quot;You can&#39;t yell your are muted.&quot;);

}[/code]

How do I go about making these player rights exist in game, and how do I make the little admin and mod crown go to player right 5 and 3?

to do this i need to make more player rights, and swap the crowns around.. is this able to be edited on a 317? im pretty new to coding and would like some help.

              <p>[quote=“slay603, post:4, topic:335333”]Velocity thanks for the help, but thats not what I wanted. I simply wanted to make a Member player rights along with have a player… so when ppl yell there is a difference… the difference being if they are registerd on the forum or not. So all I did was add 2 different types of player rights. Replacing owner with co owner, and making a completely new one for owner. So… idk if you understand what im trying to do… but i want to have 5 different types of playerRights… and im trying to figure out how to implement them</p>
