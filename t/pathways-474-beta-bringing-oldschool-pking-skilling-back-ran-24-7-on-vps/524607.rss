    <description>[left][center]Pathways 474 Bringing Oldschool Pking &amp; Skilling Back!

What&#39;s up all, it&#39;s about time we released the Beta huh?

Information:

The Beta will last for exactly one week and everything is currently spawnable to test pking ect use setlevel to chose your levels an get pking! Within this week I hope to find as many dupes and flaws as possible. That being said, it would be extremely helpful if you all could help me do that. I will take as much information as possible from the beta and use it to my advantage to improve the server significantly based on YOUR feedback also suggestions will be considered. So enough talk, here&#39;s the link to the Beta, have fun and see you on there!

Click [url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23009557/Pathways%20474%20Offical%20Client.jar]here[/url] for desktop client 

Click [url=https://www.rspscoding.org/play/?server=Pathways%20474]here[/url] for webclient enjoy :)

Once the forums are up everything will be more easily accessible. There will also be donator benefits.

Beta is currently running on a vps 24/7 so lets get pking!

Heres a sneakpeak of oldschool tanking :)
