    <description>Hi everyone, I&#39;m quite annoyed that this doesn&#39;t just work for me and I&#39;m hoping that someone could help me with this. So, my problem is that I downloaded a 639 Source and Client. When I run the source it just runs, and when I run the client it does pop up but it doesn&#39;t seem to connect. However I&#39;ve been looking in the client.java file to find the IP it connects to (at least, that&#39;s what I used to do on my old 317 source) but I can&#39;t seem to find it. When I open my client it&#39;s also giving this error:

[code]error_game_js5connect[/code]

Any help will be appreciated.</description>
