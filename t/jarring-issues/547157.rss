    <description>I am trying to jar my Eclipse project. I currently have resources located in a data folder that is in the build path of the class. The code I use to retrieve that data is by using paths (ex: ./data/images/icon.png&quot;).


When I jar my project. The data folder disappears, the project cannot load that resource and kapoof. I don&#39;t want to use the &quot;getResourceAsStream()&quot; method. Is it possible to use paths?</description>

              <p>First of all. Do you want your resources as part of the JAR file itself, or do you want them in a directory outside of the JAR file, so it’s easier to modify them?</p>
<p>If you want them in the JAR file and use Apache Ant to build, the following may help you out (it assumes you know a little bit about Apache Ant, but the part of interest is the fileset element):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;jar destfile="${dist.dir}/${project.name}.jar" basedir="${build.dir}"&gt;
    &lt;manifest&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/manifest&gt;
    &lt;fileset dir="${resources.dir}" excludes="**/.*/**"/&gt;
&lt;/jar&gt;</code></pre>
<p>As you may know, the path to the resources may be relative to the class-path directory in which the class you’re loading it with resides. You can add multiple class-path directories with the same sub-path. Say, for instance, that you have your JAR file with a HelloWorld.PNG file in it. You can have another directory that is not part of your JAR file, but has the same sub-directory structure as in your JAR file and is in the class-path, which also could have a HelloWorld.PNG file. The one that will be loaded, depends. But in the usual case, it would be the one first added to the class-path.</p>
<p>As AtomicInt_ said, you have other options when finding your resources. For instance:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">URL url0 = com.company.product.ProductInfo.class.getResource("/com/company/product/ProductInfo.class");
URL url1 = com.company.product.ProductInfo.class.getResource("ProductInfo.class");</code></pre>
<p>The above code assumes that you have a “com/company/product/ProductInfo.class” file in your class-path. In this case you will do, if you run the code from within for instance Eclipse. The first URL is relative to your class-path. That is, it’s the full name of the resource. The second URL is relative to the package name of the ProductInfo class. The slash in the beginning of the first URL makes it the absolute URL.</p>

<p>getResourceAsStream() is one option, you could also use a File and convert it to a URI or use a URI if you want to hardcode the URI scheme.</p>

              <p>Make the data folder a source folder, also you need to read any paths as a resource; there are going to be problems if you don’t.</p>
