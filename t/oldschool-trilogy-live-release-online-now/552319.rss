[SIZE=5]Need PKers to Fill the Wilderness!(:[/SIZE]

[color=blue]About Us: We Released for Everyone the play on 07/04/15! We have a semi small but very nice community.
This server was made to be a basic oldschool pking server where you can quickly level &amp; quickly make money for the gear you need to start pking. (some of the best gear does take some time to get)
My goal is to have a full wilderness all the time and having a community that comes together to do thinks like clan pking, bossing, god wars, &amp; Raid (future boss, with plans to need 5-10 man raid team).
The comat xp is fast, and average skilling xp so players can take there time and skill if the dont feel like pvp or pvm.
Nearly every skill works and makes money on here &amp; except for the top for iteams most gear is semi easy to obtain so no one should really have to much trouble making some money.(:
I have 3 people that help me code the server and there is normally atleast a couple small updates everyday.

The Idea for OST came from my favorite rsps i&#39;ve played which was 2speced; a Pk server that have every easy lvling and you could make quick money and start pking within no time after starting (atleast in welfare gear). 
Ofcource 2speced was delta and had its problems which is my im not doing a complete remake of 2speced, im using the idea of quick money and leveling and adding nice welfare pk gear to shops; then im changing things up to make it my own.




Features:
-pk fast
-::pure
-1m starter
-all basic pk gear in shops (whips Temp)
-3 difficulties clue/ mystery box
-full godwars
-dagg kings
-kbd
-nice slayer with rewards
-os items (bandos, armadyl, void, dbow, whip, barrows, ags, dds, ect.
-added arma cbow and comp cape
-enhanced crafting to make enchanted bolts
-skill, pvm, bossing, and pking makes money
-nearly all skills (all should be fixed very soon)
-barrows
-custom castle assault minigame (torso, runedef, bgloves, ect
-pkp shop
-slayer shop
-donation, vote, and loyatly shop coming soon
-enhanced combat
-sea turtles heal 24hp but need 92 fishing (33 wilderness)
&amp;much more

Work in Progress:
-Raid custom boss needing 5-10man raid team for rares mystery box and other nice gear
-untrimmed skill capes for 100m xp
-titles shop
-don &amp; vote shop
-slayer ring
- Cosmetic/ rare Lava Whip from kril
-two difficulties for jad (23waves for firecape or 63waves for firecape and title)
-proper farming
-full agility
