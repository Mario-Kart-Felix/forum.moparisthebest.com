    <description>Hey guys again! We will be making a new open-source project called Exelation. By open-source I mean that every new version we make, we will release it to you guys. This will be a mission to try to make it as much like as real Runescape as possible.

[b]Planned Updates[/b]

[i]Add a jail system (users who disbehave either automatically or manually from a moderator) will get sent to a cage in Varrock and tele-blocked.[/i]

[i]The rotton tomato store will work and the graphics should be able to be made.[/i]

[i]Spawn most npc&#39;s where they&#39;re supposed to be (which is easy but should take long :P)[/i]

[i]Get all the skills working besides hunter and construction with the interfaces to pick what to make.[/i]

[i]Get some loops going on around the place.[/i]

[i]Make some mini-games.[/i]

[i]Get some brand-new skills.[/i]

[u]And more![/u]

[b]Hopeful Updates[/b]

[i]Make a discipline system.[/i]

[i]Get hunter and construction working (either exactly the same or with the same concept).[/i]

[i]Get the special bar and specials working bugless for all weapons with gfx and everything.[/i]

[u]And more![/u]
------------------
The jobs available are the following:

[b]Idea Man[/b]

[b]NPC Adder[/b]

[b]Skill Maker[/b]

[b]Minigame Developer[/b]

[b]System Maker[/b]

[b]&quot;Other&quot; Coder[/b]

I am currently the only developer and I will work on the server overall.

Use the following application to apply:

[b]Experience as a Coder:[/b]

[b]What&#39;s an int, what&#39;s a void, and what&#39;s a class (n00b test):[/b]

[b]Job:[/b]

[b]MSN and/or AIM:[/b]

[b]Other:[/b]
-----------
Thank you and I hope this project forms into a success. This is not a day project. This will take a long time. I hope the result benefits the whole Runescape private server community!</description>
