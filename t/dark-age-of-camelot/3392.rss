    <description>Dark Age of Camelot is a really well thought out mmorpg.

If your tired of playing WoW or other games like it, but you still want to play an mmorpg, I stronly recommend DAoC. They did just about everything right, the PvP is awesome, the economy is player-driven and very stable, you can customize your character a lot, and there is a lot of different armours/weopens. The graphics are not all that up to date, but they are certainly not bad and the system requirements are low. They&#39;ve got an awesome particle system to go with the graphics to give everything a vibrant glow. 

I purchased 2 months of this game and have loved every moment of it. If your into game design then you may want to try this out because Im telling you, everything was done right. There is a 14 day trial, however you need a credit card to activate the trial.

<p>This was supposed to be the “EverQuest killer” when it came out, wasn’t it?

<p>I really don’t know, lol. The only way to kill everquest is to spend more money on a game <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> <em>Cough</em> WoW <em>Cough</em><br>
I bought a month of EQ2, and I met the sys. requirements, yet it still wouldn’t play. Do you think i could get any support from SOE? No, they never answered me. I asked on the forums, I emailed them a thousand times… So annoying. I never got to play at all. I often purchase a month for games for research purposes <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
