    <title>Australian Prime Minister goes fucking crazy</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/australian-prime-minister-goes-fucking-crazy/303357</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Kevin Rudd has refused to apologise for repeatedly swearing during a meeting with factional bosses earlier this month, saying the &quot;robust conversation&quot; was consistent with Labor Party traditions.

A number of MPs copped some expletives when they visited the prime minister&#39;s parliament house office to object to plans to cut politicians&#39; annual printing allowances by 25 per cent to $75,000.

The PM said in the presence of three female MPs: &quot;I don&#39;t care what you f***ers think,&quot; News Limited has reported.

He later told another senator: &quot;You can get f***ed.&quot;

Mr Rudd admits he swore.

&quot;It&#39;s fair to say, consistent with the traditions of the Australia Labor Party, we&#39;re given to robust conversations,&quot; Mr Rudd told reporters in New York when asked about the meeting.

&quot;I made my point of view absolutely clear.

&quot;These entitlements needed to be cut back.

&quot;I make no apology for either the content of my conversation or the robustness with which I expressed my views.&quot;

In a random survey of printing allowance use, the auditor-general found that in 74 per cent of instances the entitlement was at risk of being misused.

During the 2007/08 financial year - which covered the 2007 election - the auditor-general found some MPs were using the printing allowance primarily for re-election purposes.

Foreign Minister Stephen Smith says Mr Rudd doesn&#39;t have more of a potty mouth than anyone else in the community.

&quot;There&#39;s as much chance of the prime minister swearing as you and I have sworn from time to time in the past,&quot; he told the Nine Network&#39;s Laurie Oakes.

&quot;All of us engage regrettably in that sort of language from time to time.&quot;

Mr Smith said the most important thing was that the policy of capping printing payments was &quot;absolutely right&quot;.

Infrastructure Minister Anthony Albanese declined to comment on the swearing because he wasn&#39;t at the meeting but said the prime minister had acted appropriately regarding the allowance.

&quot;The Australian people will get some comfort from the fact that the prime minister isn&#39;t dictated to by any group, faction, interest group within the party,&quot; Mr Albanese told Network Ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>I only know about the American political system, but here anyone that was voted into a political position by the people can be “fired” by a certain number of votes.  The first step in this is impeachment (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment</a>) and by looking at that page it appears the UK has something at least similar to the system we have here.</p>

<p>As you probably know, though, Australian government is essentially controlled by one of two parties.<br>
Neither of them are really ‘in touch’ with the citizens. Quite frankly most politicians are completely detached and oblivious to the day-to-day life of Joe Citizen. They give themselves fucking $75 meal allowances for each day (most people would spend less than that to feed themselves for a week, or even a fortnight in some cases), and one idiot politician thinks that the PM’s pay should go up from the ~340k that it currently sits at to $1m (see <a href="http://money.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=867608&amp;rss=yes" rel="nofollow noopener">http://money.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=867608&amp;rss=yes</a>).</p>
<p>They’re all fucking stupid and it shits me to no end. I should rename and move this topic; maybe later.</p>

<p>That’s my problem with it (sort of).</p>
<p>The fact is, there are plenty of people who just don’t give a shit. This is fine, this is me sometimes, I didn’t vote in the European elections this year (although I regretted it, more on that in a sec :/) If you use compulsory voting, you’re forcing a bunch of people who don’t give a shit to put a name on paper, you’re not (and can’t) force them to give a shit, so they’ll just vote randomly.</p>
<p>Or more likely, they’ll vote for whoever swayed them better.</p>
<p>And then we get shit like BNP members on the EU council.</p>
<p>Wish I’d given a shit this year.</p>

The problem with that is it would lead to endless contention for the position, and people would be constantly voting. That’s why minimum terms exist - to make the expectations on a citizen, with regards to voting, reasonable. Australia has compulsory voting, unlike America.<br>
Is it compulsory to vote in the UK?</p>

<p>Perhaps the ability to change the MP during his/her term would help? If the majority of the MP’s voters decide he should leave, they can vote for it.</p>

<p>Force the MP to live in the area he represents, and he will think twice before he decides not to report. Make it a habit to hold bi-monthly or quarterly meetings, where involved citizens can get together and discuss various decisions and plans with their representative.</p>
<p>If you want to go even further, you can divide the country into small states. Let’s say one state consists of 30.000 households. Every state has their own budget, and there are general arrangements such as health care that have to be paid from that budget. The remainder of the budget can be freely spend on things the citizens vote for. This forces the citizens to decide what they want via referendum’s, and be actively involved with their surroundings.</p>

<p>True.</p>
<p>IMO, the reason for this is simple: You vote for someone you barely know. Vote for a person, and you vote for his party. The era of party politics has passed, what a parliament should consist of are representatives of small districts. This way it is possible to have interaction between the representative and the citizen. No longer the MP represents the party he is member of, but those who have put their trust in him.

<p>You can see that the Dutch government is already pushing important decisions away. We have elections in 2010 for our municipality’s, and parliament elections in 2011. Already the party’s try to change their image, and hesitate when something important has to be done.</p>
<p>Heck, someone that is as charismatic as Obama or Hitler can easily spark a revolution in the Netherlands. The Northern provinces are starting to get fed up with The Hague, especially the farmers.</p>

<p>It makes sense, once Australia banned guns the police have to do 99999999999x more work because they have to protect everyone from everyone instead of allowing law-abiding citizens to protect themselves.</p>
<p>It is ridiculous that they ban all of this stuff from full grown adults, mommy knows best I guess, except mommy is your government.  Hopefully you can change this stuff through legislation and peaceful protests, but I doubt it because the government has nothing to fear from an un-armed people.  I really feel sorry for you guys. :([/quote]<br>
Nothing ever happens in this country. Politicians screw around doing whatever they can to line their own wallets, but that’s about it (eg, a $75/day meal allowance came into effect this year; most people wouldn’t spent that in a week if they were only feeding themselves).<br>
Politicians get pressured, protests take place, but you’re right; they don’t achieve much.</p>
<p>On the bright side, the Labor government relaxed gun laws a little bit when they came into power (for example, people can now try target shooting sports without first acquiring their licence – before they had to go through the entire process before even touching a gun).<br>
We still have other ridiculous things that need to go though, such as bans on video games. Nothing should ever be banned in my opinion; if something is so bad then odds are people will stay away from it on their own accord.</p>
<p>I think I’m going to have a public outburst one day for shits and giggles, and then when someone gets up me I’ll simply say that the “outburst was merely robust in nature, in keeping with the traditions of this country’s government”.</p>
