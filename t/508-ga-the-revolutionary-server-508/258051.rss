    <description>ok so i have decided this. version 3 will be released today so im going to start a new 508


reasons version 3 is being released early:
I started to become lazy by adding stuff that i did not look at and forgot about
source became UNSTABLE

my next source will be released in sections. the first one will have 100% shops clan wars/clan chat and summoning. with a better combat.

v2 updated v1 with more stuff

and so on

you should expect in the first few versions:

Assault minigame
a better castlewars
a better bounty hunter
Clan wars
jad minigame (right place)
Fight pits
clan chat
Summoning (because it is a combat skill)
Dueling
Mage bank

as you can see these are all combat related.

i will have about 5 releases before to make non-combat stuff gets released.

my main goals for this:

to learn more java
make a stable/reliable server
make a good base for newcomers but not fully done so you have to actually work on it


unlike my last releases this server will have a home (lunar isle) and will have quests etc to earn things.

it will be a non-command based server and all teleports will be by item operated or magic tab.

there will not be a &quot;training area&quot; because it will be spread out. such as i will have revenents and dragons in the wilderness, men in lumbridge, guards in falador and varrok.


also to look for is a possibility of a working grand exchange, trade, and shops (not dragonkings)

~~GA the revolution of 508&#39;s~~


pictures will be coming soon, but since i have not started yet i cant add any :(
