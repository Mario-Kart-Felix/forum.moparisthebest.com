    <title>This would be a great Destruct-O-Match II Script</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/this-would-be-a-great-destruct-o-match-ii-script/93568</link>
    <description>It would take probably a very time, but imagine this as the grid *points down*


x x x x x x x x x x
x x x x x x x x x x

For the bottom left x, and the one just to the right of that, you would look for an orange colour. Like ( if(findcolor(x,y,12389,24,56,948,383)) and (findcolor(x,y,12389,53,64,284,494)), and then for the next set of squares, and so on. Then copy and paste that code, and change the &quot;12389&quot; to the color for blue in all of them, and then green etc..

This would take a very long time but would be much less detectable, and get a much better score :) - Also, remember to add in wait times so it doesnt freeze.[br][size=1]Posted on: May 12, 2007, 03:44:16 PM[/size][hr]Lol @ replying to my own topic like 1 min after :) But, I&#39;m gonna try to make this, it shouldnt be too hard - but I&#39;ll race someone to finish it if they like :)</description>

<p>No problem, btw there is a pretty decent destructo script working right now, maybe you should try playing with that and color tolerances? (Color tolerances are used to find colors that are similar but changed)</p>

<p>I made one with bitmaps. But didn’t work out because it was clicking on the highest boulder from the top of my screen it could find.<br>
There is a very good one already out there that uses co-ordinates.</p>

<p>Nice thought but actually, neopets uses color changers so that the different colors may not be detectable to the eyes but they would mess up a program. There have already been programs that have used findcolor to find the same color in any two locations that have become obsolete.</p>
