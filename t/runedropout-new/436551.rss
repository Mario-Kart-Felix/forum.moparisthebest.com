    <description>Okay so i havent acually started this and im not really looking for any help, but if u know some stuff and would like to help out feel free to reply, the reason i havent started this is because i want people to tell me something
Would you rather play an amazing 
317 delta
317 allstar
I think they are the same not 100% sure
or like 637
What should i use? i dont need a base or anything i can find them but should it be like 637 317
Now i plan on coding in everything all skills all spec ect,
And id rather use a 317 being that every 637 has a horable problem with the files not working correctly, and wont save or compile right, idk why but they just suck, but if more people would prefer it ill work around it and manage, but if it was 317 would you play it?
Thank you and please leave feedback.
Also i will constantly update this with what i have added.
If you have a certain base you think i should code i will be happy to take a look.
Another thing is after i am completly done i plan on releasing the source, sorry if my grammer isnt right, i dont have that great spelling or grammer...:P</description>
