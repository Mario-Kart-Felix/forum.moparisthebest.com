<p>NEWS: Ventrillo has joined to help me</p>
<p>I am pleased to say that Ventrillo is now joining the project to help me, I asked him as I was impressed by his fishing code, and he accepted. Hopefully we should see some good updates by him soon! Thanks Ventrillo!</p>
<p>No update manager yet though, maybe tomorrow.</p>
<p>NEWS: ALPHA 2 RELEASED!</p>
<p>Alpha 2 contains all the goodness of alpha 1, but with NPC dialogue (thanks Jonas for the head animation!) and a walking bug fixed (thanks Fallen!).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.grahamedgecombe.com/tmp/sr/alpha2.rar" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.grahamedgecombe.com/tmp/sr/alpha2.rar</a></p>
<p>To set it up run the setup.bat file, which will compile it for the first time.</p>
<p>Then in the future use compile.bat to compile.</p>
<p>As usual, run.bat will run the server.</p>
<p>NEWS: ALPHA 1 RELEASED!</p>
<p>Alpha 1 has been released, and you don’t need Eclipse! It comes with three batch files: compile.bat, run.bat and debug.bat. Compile.bat is obviosuly the compiler, and you need to set your PATH environment variable correctly (or put the JDK path inside the batch file), run.bat runs the server in production mode and debug.bat runs the server in debug mode. If you have problems with events you add, run the server in debug mode as it should print more exceptions out!</p>
<p>You can download it from <a href="http://www.grahamedgecombe.com/tmp/sr/alpha1.rar" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.grahamedgecombe.com/tmp/sr/alpha1.rar</a></p>
<p>This release includes everything in revision 38 (basically near-full woodcutting, near-full mining, better peformance using NIO, bones burying, packets/commands handled through hashmap, lots of refactoring!). Enjoy!</p>
<p>I hope to make more releases soon!</p>
<p>About the server</p>
<p>Basically, I want to write a server that is stable, secure, fast and reliable. Many servers are like this, but most of you find them hard to use (e.g. RS2D) and they have few features.</p>
<p>So, I’ve decided to write a Winterlove-based server, apply all the stability fixes I can throw at it, and come up with something decent for you all, with some quests and skills while I’m at it!</p>
<p>I’m not going to put a stupid percent meter or anything, since how do you judge it? I’m just going to post the updates as I make them, maybe add a few screenshots every now and again, etc.</p>
<p>This is going to be open source, but I haven’t added it to the ‘Downloads’ section since it is far from complete. Maybe when it is a mod could move the topic or I will just make another one.</p>
<p>Oh, and if someone would make a logo that would be nice cos I’m a programmer, not a graphics designer.</p>
<p>Screenshots and videos</p>
<p>Since you probably want a few, here you go:</p>
<p>Combat!:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.grahamedgecombe.com/tmp/sr/combat.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Fishing with rod</p>
<p><img src="http://www.grahamedgecombe.com/tmp/sr/rodfish.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Fading interface video:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.grahamedgecombe.com/tmp/sr/fadinginterface.swf" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.grahamedgecombe.com/tmp/sr/fadinginterface.swf</a></p>
<p>Greyed out rocks</p>
<p><img src="http://www.grahamedgecombe.com/tmp/sr/greyrocks.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Object spawns (the new ObjectManager basically) - the two fishing barrels are added from a cfg file:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.grahamedgecombe.com/tmp/sr/staticObjects.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Woodcutting video (with stumps disappearing!):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.grahamedgecombe.com/tmp/sr/woodcuttingWithObjectManager.swf" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.grahamedgecombe.com/tmp/sr/woodcuttingWithObjectManager.swf</a></p>
<p>And to prove it is not just for yourself, the same thing from a second viewpoint:</p>

<p>Fishing (thanks Ventrillo, who did all the code!):</p>
<p><img src="http://www.grahamedgecombe.com/tmp/sr/fishing.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Level up messages (and you can see the end of the still graphics, my timing was bad lol) - set to URL as I reached the 10 image limit:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.grahamedgecombe.com/tmp/sr/levelupmessages.png" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.grahamedgecombe.com/tmp/sr/levelupmessages.png</a></p>
<p>NPC Dialogue video:</p>

<p>NPC Dialogue video (old, view one above!)!:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.grahamedgecombe.com/tmp/sr/dialogue.swf" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.grahamedgecombe.com/tmp/sr/dialogue.swf</a></p>
<p>Woodcutting skill (and an NPC):<br>
<img src="http://www.grahamedgecombe.com/tmp/sr/woodcutting.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Mining skill:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.grahamedgecombe.com/tmp/sr/mining.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Prayer - burying bones:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.grahamedgecombe.com/tmp/sr/prayer-burybones.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Server console (no outputting heaps of crap like a standard Winterlove server, and pretty timestamps too!):<br>
<img src="http://www.grahamedgecombe.com/tmp/sr/console.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>I’ll add some more decent ones when there are decent ones to take!</p>
<p>More technical details of it</p>
<p>It’s going to use my EventManager instead of hundreds of process() timers, so it should run very smoothly.</p>
<p>It has SYIpkpker protection code (3 connections per host), a huge Client object is not made on connection (less RAM usage) and is non threaded. This should make a decent impact on performance, especially on large servers.</p>
<p>I’m adding javadoc comments as much as possible, so when I do generate doc files it should be really easy to find out how it all works and fits together!</p>
<p>It is packaged, and it does not come with a build/run files. I didn’t add a build/run batch files since the packaging may change when I refactor anything, and I don’t want to mess around with adding them. Maybe when I do a release build I will add them, but for now, I reccomend you use a Java IDE (like Eclipse).</p>
<p>Picture of the way I have layed out the code/data files (now a URL cos of stupid 10 limit!):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.grahamedgecombe.com/tmp/sr/codelayout.png" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.grahamedgecombe.com/tmp/sr/codelayout.png</a></p>
<p>I am not going to answer questions on how to compile/run the beta versions of this project. That is up to you.</p>
<p>Based on: Winterlove, with my stability fixes.<br>

<p>Subversion</p>
<p>Although this isn’t ready, you can still grab the code. Since it’s not the final release, it probably will contain bugs and not everything will be done.</p>
<p>Trunk URL (if you want the latest source):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.grahamedgecombe.com/svn/...olutions/trunk" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.grahamedgecombe.com/svn/...olutions/trunk</a></p>
<p>Alpha 7 URL (for the current stable source - reccomended!):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.grahamedgecombe.com/svn/...ns/tags/alpha7" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.grahamedgecombe.com/svn/...ns/tags/alpha7</a></p>
<p>The username is shardrevolutions. There is no password. This will give you read only access to the repository.</p>
<p>(If you think that link is advertising then you are an idiot. My website contains nothing about private servers, apart from the Subversion for this project. If an admin/mod wants me to remove the link then I happily will, but I believe that people should be able to checkout the current source if they want.)</p>
<p>A good subversion client to use is TortoiseSVN (<a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://tortoisesvn.net/</a>). Once you have downloaded it, create a new folder for this, right-click it and select SVN Checkout. Enter the URL. It will then prompt you for the username and password (which are above), and probably give an error about an invalid certificate. This is ok, as the certificate is self signed. Now you should have the source code! When you want to update the source code to the latest version, just right click -&gt; TortoiseSVN -&gt; SVN Update.</p>
<p>I will not be providing a virus scan. If you think a virus scanner can detect a virus in a source file, you a very wrong and I suggest you go and learn about how they work.</p>
<p>Updates (this certainly will grow!):</p>

    * The Stream class now auto expands better, and is set to 128 bytes for efficieny.
    * The garbage collector should now be run every minute to keep RAM usage down.
    * All the input/output is now done through the NIO API! Should be faster, and the selector (as opposed to polling) means that it is a lot less strenuous on the CPU when the server is idle.
    * Fixed a bug where if you logged in 3 times then logged out it would not let you login again (due to the syi protection) - thanks hayzie!
    * Bug fix where events would still run if you walked away.
    * Bug fix where server would not stop even if it didn't start.
    * Handling packet code is now wrapped in a try/catch statement - to protect users writing their own code.
    * Added inStream reset() call to keep RAM usage down.

    * Packets are now handled using a hashmap.
    * Faster IO that runs every 30ms instead of 500ms.
    * The Stream class will now automatically create a larger buffer if it is needed.
    * Removed a lot of the things from the client class. (It is now only 9,931 bytes (around 9 kilobytes) for those who think size matters). It basically contains the raw packet handling code. All the game logic (skills, quests) will be in their own class files for ease of use.
    * Moved the client methods to the ActionAssistant and ContainerAssistant classes. Helps to split things up for readability.
    * Removed nearly everything from process() which should help with lag. It just has two checks in it: the kicked check and the global message check. These will probably be removed.
    * Added NPCs from scratch so they are more stable.
    * Added NPC/item loaders.
    * Moved prayer bury bones call to its skill class.
    * Added woodcutting (only thing left to do is make the tree stump appear after a tree is cut down - still need to work on an objectmanager for this).
    * Added my rewritten ItemManager from RuneFusion final build.
    * Added turn to update mask, and also made woodcutting turn you to the tree you cut down.
    * Added some more details to the PlayerDetails class (old PlayerSave). I will probably add a different way of saving/loading later, possibly from a MySQL database (optional) or binary files.
    * Base work on friends/ignores.
    * Added a membership flag (default false). If you are a member, it sets your bank size to 800, if non member 120. If you are a member, your friends list size is set to 200, otherwise 100. Ignore list size is always set to 100 (note to self, still need to init the lists!).


16th of August 2008

    * I basically started working on this today. Did nothing major, just a few small things.
    * Did some refactoring and moved the packages around a bit.
    * Commands now work through a hashmap - should be faster and more reliable. And a lot easier than a huge if statement for all of them.
    * Added ban/mute/rights codes from the RuneFusion 1.0.5 build.
    * Added a UID ban to the ban processor class!
    * When you login you are asked to design your appearance.
    * Fixed Winterlove teleport in same region bug.</code></pre>
