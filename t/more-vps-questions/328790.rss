    <description>Hey guys im planning on buying a vps and i need to know some questions.

#1 Do you run the server off the computer or on the vps the only reason im getting this is because my server is alot most of the time and i dont like keeping it on to run the source. so does the vps run your source thanks.

#2 Can someone tell me how many players 64MB Ram Vps will hold and a 128Mb Ram will hold.

#3 Can anyone tell me any trusted VPS sites im looking for somthing around 1-20 dollars a month</description>

              <p>Which the $18 one is quite laggy. Even with like 10 players online. So I wouldn’t recommend it.</p>

<p><span class="hashtag">#1</span> - The VPS will run the server 24/7, however any glitches that shut down your server will have to be reset manually or with a server restarter.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#2</span> - I’m not really sure what your asking, but 64MB of ram sounds like it would hold barely anyone…most people buy a VPS with 2GB+.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#3</span> -Just use Google. People have also posted them around here before, most likely in the general discussion section.</p>

<p>I usually don’t allow VPS questions in this section, but since I have missed a few I will let this one slide.</p>
