    <title>Resignation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/resignation/399028</link>
    <description>I would like to resign as a staff member. I do not enjoy the community as it currently is. I can&#39;t seem to enjoy the game for how I&#39;d like to play it (with others) without being unhappy with simple &quot;thievery&quot; or everyone bickering over issues. People on this server are too immature and I may be as well for not &quot;putting up with it&quot;. You can go and find someone else to replace me because I won&#39;t be playing on the server unless the community itself proves that it can stop being 5 year olds and just play together peacefully.</description>

Alot of rules just don’t make sense because of the raid vs build issue. There’s no fine line between right and wrong and it leaves alot for us to make up for and it takes it toll after awhile.</p>

              <p>Too easy to bend, too easy to escape. Frankly, I believe we don’t enforce the rules hard enough because we need to “interpret” the rules to our opinions. Rules need to be set in stone and there needs to be a compromise. Something that stops the extra annoyances. Too many reports of griefing are coming in lately (now that summer started up). We need to find a way to straighten up the community before it crumbles from the inside out.</p>

<p>Personally I agree with you, but I see it as a problem to fix, not something to run away from. I know people disagree with me, but I personally think how lax we are with the rules is what makes people bend them so much. Allowing thievery, and then adding a clause allowing people to grief in order to thieve…</p>
<p>The community is split in two, pretty cut and dry to be honest. We have a portion that has fun by raiding, and PvP, and that’s fine because that’s how they interpret the game. Then there are people that find the point of the game to be creative building, and dislike PvP/raiding. Like you said, the two types usually can’t coexist peacefully without one having to sacrifice.</p>
