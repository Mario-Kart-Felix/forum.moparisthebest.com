    <title>What drew you to private servers in the first place?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-drew-you-to-private-servers-in-the-first-place/539204</link>
    <description>The title is pretty self explanatory. Mainly due to all the diversity here I was just curious as to how so many different people came together. How did you find out about them in the first place? 

As for me, I was in my freshman year of high school and I saw a kid fighting barrows, and I was amazed that he was maxed out combat (because I thought it was Runescape, at the time I had no clue that private servers even existed.) So he introduced me to the server that happened to be Near Reality during its beginning years.</description>

              <p>I believe the first time I tried out private servers was when another player on RuneScape told me about them. At first, I thought he was trying to phish my password or something, but it turned out to be an actual private server. I kind of regret that moment, because it made me lose my ambition for playing RuneScape, but I would not be a part of this amazing community if it weren’t for it.</p>

              <p>A friend originally told me about it back in 2006 or 2007? I was bored one day and eventually stumbled across this website and ended up downloading the moparscape client and would play on the built in hybridscape server (believe thats the name?) that it came with. Eventually I learned how to connect to other servers, and I remember the first server I ever played was probably the best server i’ve ever played lol. If i recall correctly, you would login with robin hat, dragon chainbody/legs, ranger boots, barrow gloves, fire cape, abyssal whip, dragon square, fury. You would hit the dummies for attack exp, the doors for strength xp, the haystacks for defence xp, the bookcases for magic xp, the rounded target things for ranging XP. In the quest tab, there would be options to spawn stuff, like barrows, runes (even though spells didn’t require you to use runes), and some other stuff. In the emotes tab, there would be options to teleport around, like mages bank, and all. There was another server I recall playing which was pretty fun too, you would alch robin hats noted for money, but I believe not a lot of people knew about that, and I recall always buying phat sets off of staff from alching those robin hats noted. I also remember camping at the lesser demon which was in Crandor, it would drop rune claws which would hit extremely high i believe? or would hit like 2-3 times at once, forgot was quite a while back, was a pretty fun server, but none of these servers lasted long before the owner shut them down.</p>

              <p>I was pretty young when I started runescape (I think like 5-6) and I really didn’t understand how to play or use Google. I hated losing, and I loved cheating. So I started searching things like “how to cheat on runescape” or similar, and eventually I came across a small client called the moparscape client. You could spawn every item, had all 99s, and it was awesome for me at the time.</p>

              <p>Out of curiosity, I knew that other gaming communities had private servers running and was curious if anyone made a private server for Runescape, so I Google’d it and ended up here. Learned how to run, and edit minor things, as well as hosted my first winterlove server. Training on haystacks, doors, and dummies. It was a fun experience, and viola as the community grew, I grew.</p>

<p>As for me, I was in my freshman year of high school and I saw a kid fighting barrows, and I was amazed that he was maxed out combat (because I thought it was Runescape, at the time I had no clue that private servers even existed.) So he introduced me to the server that happened to be Near Reality during its beginning years.</p>
