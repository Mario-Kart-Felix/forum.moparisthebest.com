<p>Not trying to advertise here, but did i mention you get a $2 free credit if you register?<br>
I’ve mentioned this everywhere but it seems like a lot less people registered than i thought.<br>
I thought it was a pretty good idea…[br][br][size=1]Posted on: January 24, 2009, 01:47:23 pm[/size][hr]I’ve decided it needs a lot more work, mods feel free to put a lock on this one.</p>

The website’s purpose is to let people talk to pretty girls in the language the customer wants to learn.<br>

              <p>The layout of the site is good, but the style is all fucked up. You’ve got like the <a href="http://apple.com" rel="nofollow noopener">apple.com</a> website background from like 12 years ago. Like urban stuff, then like glossy stuff. You need like one theme for the entire site. It looks like you just took a bunch of shit and plastered it together. Also, way too much unused space in the header area.</p>
