<p>No, just kidding. I’m not like that anymore o_O’</p>
<p>I do suggest you learn java before you attempt at a private server, otherwise this could become very confusing for you.</p>
<p>If you want to change the co-ordinates of an NPC, they can be modified in the autospawn.cfg file which is located inside a folder called “cfg” (usually). If not, it will be in the same place as your classes (again, usually).</p>
<p>For your home coords problem, you have to go into the Player class (player.java) to edit where the player is spawned upon account creation. Just search for:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">initial</code></pre>
<p>The coords the player spawns at should be defined right below the first result.</p>
