    <description>I really did not know where to put this... So mods you can fuck it up however you want if you have to..

Anywyas, all I asked for on the server development\help forum was how to make an item have a &quot;Buy X&quot; option.. Anyways, Dr. Dre said he could do it for a price.. Anyways it turned into this: I would give him my woodcutter/mage account for a full working castlewars script and a &quot;how to&quot; on making a no-ip thing work. Yes, I am desperate. Well anyways, I gave him the password and he went on, he asked about recovery questions and all that and basically I said okay now can you help me with that stuff, only to find that about 3 minutes later he replied with &quot;done with ur account&quot; and logged off MSN. Now keep in mind that I have not played RS for about 8 months now and I had ABSOLUTELY NOTHING of value on the account.. Except the stats of course. So I log into my account and this is what I see...

The only reason I trusted him is because he is a senior member here and had good tutorials so I knew he was a good coder... I have nothing on the account now and don&#39;t really care because he only took what was in it which was all about 60k worth. I am still looking for help on castlewars and no-ip... If anyone would like to help it would be very much appreciated. I am not a noob at all, even though I only know very basic coding, I know how to fix most compile errors, make commands, and all that stuff. I know very well how to use the search button, and follow tutorials... Once again if anyone would like to help.. All I need is to find out how to make a WORKING parseincomingpackets2(); and how to get a no-ip thing working... add me on MSN if you want.. l3remner@hotmail.com

Anyone who read this whole post, thank you, anyone who didn&#39;t read is and is proceeding to flame me, don&#39;t... Because I really don&#39;t care...</description>
