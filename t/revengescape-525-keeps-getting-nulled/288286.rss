    <title>Revengescape 525 keeps getting nulled?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/revengescape-525-keeps-getting-nulled/288286</link>
    <description>Hello I am using revengescape 525 and it has no restarter that works and so i have to use normal run.bat and at least once every half hour the server gets nulled or something where when you log in you cant see anything but the runescape world you cant see yourself or anyone else... I have to keep going back into my vps to turn it off then turn it back on so i can do it in 20 minutes again? Please help me... Do you think I need an auto-restarter? OR has anyone else that has used revengescape know what to do? Please help!</description>

              <p>It could be the anti leech program giving you the nulls. People put it on their server so no one can steal their stuff. Is the server laggy before the nulls come?</p>
