    <title>[317]possible to make an item drop rate less than 1%</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-possible-to-make-an-item-drop-rate-less-than-1/354100</link>
    <description>I was just wondering cuz i have a strong monster that drops a lot of stuff on my server, and people are still able to kill it, I was wondering if it was possible at all to make an item less than 1% drop rate.. I have tried in the npc.config to make the 1 like 001 or 0.01 and none of them would let the server start right. I have a deltascape based server. Is it possible. and how.

EDIT: or should i just make the monster have more hp/be stronger.</description>
