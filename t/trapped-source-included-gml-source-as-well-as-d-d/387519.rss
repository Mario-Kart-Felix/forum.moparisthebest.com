Trapped D&amp;D Source: http://up.ht/ghEw3k
Trapped GML Source: http://up.ht/ebMsMP[/b][/size](To help others understand the language a bit more)

[u][b]Cheats:[/b][/u]
Cheat1: press enter to bring up the password entry box and type &quot;untrapped&quot; to go to the next level.
Cheat2: press shift to bring up the password entry box a type &quot;buffedball&quot; to make your character invincible to any of the traps. Walls still kill.

[u][b]About:[/b][/u]
A game in which you have to guide the dot through the maze with your mouse without touching the walls or traps.

[u][b]Note:[/b][/u]
There is a note in the game information (lacated in the help menu) for Moparscape, YoYo Games, and GameDev. I hope that this game/source will help teach others and that you all enjoy playing it.

              <p>Lol you can make 3D games with it here is a 3D fps I am making. Its not even close to being done but here are the basics. So far it has only one level and only 4 guns to choose from. Just load it from game maker pro and click the green run game button at the top. Its going to be an online fps just like crossfire.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Cheats:</span></span><br>
Cheat1: press enter to bring up the password entry box and type “untrapped” to go to the next level.<br>
Cheat2: press shift to bring up the password entry box a type “buffedball” to make your character invincible to any of the traps. Walls still kill.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">About:</span></span><br>
A game in which you have to guide the dot through the maze with your mouse without touching the walls or traps.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Note:</span></span><br>
There is a note in the game information (lacated in the help menu) for Moparscape, YoYo Games, and GameDev. I hope that this game/source will help teach others and that you all enjoy playing it.</p>
