    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-would-i/189156</link>
    <description>Hello, tico helped me with one of my huge client problems but i would not know how to declare [code]private final static String newline = &quot;\n&quot;;[/code] in such a small Gui.java. I thought the it would be right before my code that has the \n in it but it like gave me one error G

[code]ui.java:384: illegal start of expression
                                private final static String newline = &quot;\n&quot;;
                                ^
1 error
Press any key to continue . . .[/code]

Thanks tico for giving me it, and now i understand how to make it on the next line but i do not understand where to declare it in a Gui.java...

Thank you,
