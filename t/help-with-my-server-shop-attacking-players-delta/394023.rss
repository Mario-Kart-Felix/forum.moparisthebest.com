    <description>OK, ive seen shops attacking players an followign them around and moving and it is rly anoyying me when that happened cause it ruins the point of my shops being organized n all together and i dont like them being in wrong spot. at first i thought players were using magic to hit shops and shops attack them (that is a glitch that was on rly rly old servers, some people might know bout that old glitch) but anyways.. thats the glitch i thought they was doing to i threatened to ban somebody who was being attacked by a shop, but he said all he did was trade it. ive not seen it ofter but i have seen shops attacking players a few times and i just want to know if anybody could help me fix. ide be extremely thankful(:</description>
