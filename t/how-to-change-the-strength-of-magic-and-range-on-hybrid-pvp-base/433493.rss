    <title>How to change the strength of Magic and Range on Hybrid PvP Base</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-change-the-strength-of-magic-and-range-on-hybrid-pvp-base/433493</link>
    <description>I have Hybrid PvP base (V2 I think, could be V3)

I know how to edit the item&#39;s stat bonus&#39; so I made a ring that gives +1mil bonus on everything so I can 1 hit KO NPCs etc so I know that works.


I changed the Staff Of Light&#39;s Magic Attack Bonus to 20,000 but I still don&#39;t hit higher with my Ancients (about the 30&#39;s)

Someone said that that bonus only affects how OFTEN I hit, not how hard.



I have looked ALL over for how to change how hard I hit with Magic and Range, but there seems to be no one else with this problem, or I just can&#39;t word my query right on Google.


So PLEASE can someone tell me how I can change this so I can change how to hit higher with Magic and Range :)



Thanks, Idznak</description>
