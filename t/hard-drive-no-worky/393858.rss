    <title>Hard drive no worky :(</title>

    <description>My 35 day old 640gb 2.5&quot; samsung HDD died this morning, with windows going mental saying I need to backup immediately as you&#39;d expect...
The speedfan S.M.A.R.T. test:

Basically the fitness has been decreasing 1% every day ever since 28th of April, and I never thought to do anything about it, besides take screenshots in increments of 2 days... until it died today.

So um, I emailed Overclockers UK today and they said they can replace it... but should I ask for a refund and get a different one?  Has anyone else had bad experiences with samsung drives?

Additional info, it&#39;s a secondary internal drive for my laptop (two bays), and my primary hdd is still in perfect shape even though that one is a little over a year old.  I think it&#39;s possible that continuously leaving my laptop on overnight (botting, downloading, defragging etc) has brought it&#39;s lifespan down a little, but this one only lasted a month... faulty?
Oh and data loss is not a problem, I have a 1TB external HDD which constantly backs up whenever plugged in.</description>

My friend has a 12cm cooler actually, but obviously it doesn’t direct straight onto the HDD, guess that was a stupid question… <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
