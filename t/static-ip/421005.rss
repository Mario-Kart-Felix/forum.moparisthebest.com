    <description>I go into my Network sharing center and open up my network connections and go into properties and change my &#39;Internet protocol version 4 (TCP/IPv4) under their properties and when I do that and press ok I am supposed to get a static IP address but instead I just get limited connectivity with my internet, It&#39;s like it doesn&#39;t let me make a static IP, or at least when I do it just gives me limited connectivity and won&#39;t let me on the internet. Has anyone had this problem happen to them before and can anyone help? Thanks 
Can anyone help?..</description>
