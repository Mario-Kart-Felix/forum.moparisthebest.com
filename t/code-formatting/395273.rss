    <description>I see everyone has their own code formatting set up, some have more indents than other etc. this isn&#39;t good as each time someone works with a class (or multiple) they like to auto format the code to their layout, which means in git when i&#39;m looking over things, theres a LOT of changes which is very annoying. we need to all stick with some sort of formatting and leave it at that, cause this just won&#39;t work.</description>

              <p>I just use the default formatting the Eclipse does…  It follows conventions, and I like the way it formats the code.</p>
<p>As for not mixing things, that’s kind of hard to do when pull requests take days to be answered…  I’m not going to sit around doing nothing useful after I’ve re-factored a few classes.</p>

              <p>Soft tabs (s/\t+/    /g). That should eliminate a lot of the noise that you see in commit messages. I will try to submit a version of the source formatted in this way within the next day or two.</p>
<p>Another thing that makes it easier on the people who review submissions - the following three things should preferably <em>never</em> be mixed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Refactoring (variable/class names)</li>
<li>Formatting changes (mainly referring to whitespace)</li>
<li>Actual, important changes to the source code (logic or otherwise)</li>
</ol>
<p>It is alright to mix 1 and 2 occasionally, but try to keep that to a minimum.</p>
