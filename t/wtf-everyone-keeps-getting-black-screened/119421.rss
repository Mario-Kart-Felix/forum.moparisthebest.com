    <title>Wtf? Everyone keeps getting black screened</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wtf-everyone-keeps-getting-black-screened/119421</link>
    <description>I came on today... and added the thing for that if the owner logged in it would send a message to everyone saying that he had logged in..

Then when I restarted my server... EVERYONE got black screened...
But they could still type and like look at the backpack and stats... just couldn&#39;t move... Anyone know whats wrong??

Oh yeah, I even took out the thing I put in... still doesn&#39;t work..</description>
