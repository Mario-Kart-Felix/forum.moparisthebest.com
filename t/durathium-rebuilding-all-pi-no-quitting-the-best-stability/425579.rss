<p>Yeah ^ he’s right… C&amp;Ping classes won’t make it stable at all or efficient.  If you want to improve stability, rewrite the whole players[] array because it’s retarded as hell, rewrite networking handling, tweak the threading, and tweak the player/npc updating.</p>

<p>Damn, you are silly.<br>
Take this for example. If I want to make a keylogger in Java, copy and pasting dozens of different classes, from different sources, programmed by different programmers isn’t going to work out in the long run. Nor will it be stable.</p>
<p>I’m not trolling, maybe you’re too stupid to see that. Not in any posts am I ‘claiming’ to be a smart arse, even anyone without Java knowledge could laugh at your stupid contradictions.</p>
<p>“Rebuilding PI” with copy &amp; pasta classes from Hyperion. “No Qutting” - yet you were going to quit this project to work on another development team? “The Best Stability” - when you copy and paste classes from other frameworks. It won’t make it stable.</p>
<p>Another fail project by Mr. Artem is all I see. Contradictions, lies, and bullshit.</p>

<p>Wait… What happened to rewriting the core features of PI?<br>
Mhm. Just leeching content from completely different frameworks.</p>
<p>C’mon. If you can actually code, then you can do both client and server sided. It doesn’t take a genius to know that.<br>
I’m not talking shit about Artem either. As said, I’ve worked with him previously and he doesn’t explicitly know basic concepts of Java.<br>
[/quote]Well, saying that your coming at us about coding you must be a master coder. Why don’t you recode a core for Project Insanity and we’ll see it’s better then Hyperions kay?[/quote]</p>
<p>Master coder? Your childish flame attacks bewilder me and honestly make me wonder how old you are. It’s not even related to what I said.</p>
<p>Why don’t I recode a core for PI? Firstly, please explain what you mean by core. Secondly, I wouldn’t be stupid enough to add code from all over the fucking place.<br>
Adding classes from Hyperion to PI is completely stupid. You may as well just use Hyperion if that’s the case.</p>
<p>[quote=“runewings317, post:40, topic:425579”][quote author=AtomicInt_ link=topic=528237.msg3859577#msg3859577 date=1324591214]<br>
Rep means nothing.<br>
[/quote]When you joined a few days ago and claim you can code like a fucking pro yea it kinda does xD[/quote]</p>
<p>When exactly did I state I was a professional programmer?<br>
I’ve been learning Java since February, and even know I have thousands of hours worth to learn…</p>
<p>Now, back on topic. You’re making fake claims, that’s all I was stating. You claimed you’d rewrite important elements within PI, but copy and paste classes from Hyperion. That means the server wouldn’t have the best stability, and you are not rebuilding PI either.</p>
<p>Then there’s the name of this project. ‘Durathium’. The 'ium’s at end of names is over used, and sounds stupid. Couldn’t you have thought of something, more original?</p>
<p>That isn’t me flaming, that’s the truth, from what is visible at the moment.<br>
If you can’t take constructive criticism, don’t post project threads. That’s what they’re meant for.</p>

I’ve worked with artem before, he wouldn’t know where to start on rewriting a majority of it.<br>
Also, looking at his recent threads on R-S, he was asking basic questions. Has had like 50 projects he quit at… and of course claims this will be a ‘next gen server’ when he’s using PI, same with the claims of best stability.<br>

I’ve worked with artem before, he wouldn’t know where to start on rewriting a majority of it.<br>
Also, looking at his recent threads on R-S, he was asking basic questions. Has had like 50 projects he quit at… and of course claims this will be a ‘next gen server’ when he’s using PI, same with the claims of best stability.<br>

<p>Wait… What happened to rewriting the core features of PI?<br>
Mhm. Just leeching content from completely different frameworks.</p>
<p>C’mon. If you can actually code, then you can do both client and server sided. It doesn’t take a genius to know that.<br>
I’m not talking shit about Artem either. As said, I’ve worked with him previously and he doesn’t explicitly know basic concepts of Java.[/quote]<br>
I can do both. I am mainly Client But i am codding server too. Please just get out. Your just a small noob with 10 rep crying flaming all projects. What you got? If you cant code… then just keep other do the job. I do know coding java well and if you don’t trust me then i can do nothing… Please, stop doing your smart ass because your not.</p>
<p>Edit: do i even know you?</p>

I don’t even know you. I asked some help on r-s? Probably like 2-6 times and not more like some other people asking help about all 2hours. This project will be done. I dont care if you don’t think so but i would suggest you just get out of this thread and just go fuck some where else. We are moving this up. I am not really updating the thread. Will do that on weekend(We added allot.)</p>

I’ve worked with artem before, he wouldn’t know where to start on rewriting a majority of it.<br>
Also, looking at his recent threads on R-S, he was asking basic questions. Has had like 50 projects he quit at… and of course claims this will be a ‘next gen server’ when he’s using PI, same with the claims of best stability.</p>
