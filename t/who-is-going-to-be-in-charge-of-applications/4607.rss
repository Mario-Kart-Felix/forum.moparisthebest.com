<p>I dont see how that matters at all, jagex has no claim whatsoever about SRL (besides, the actual source of SRL now is <a href="http://sourceforge.net" rel="nofollow noopener">sourceforge.net</a>)</p>

<p>thats what im talking about,  bringing back the days when only the SRL dev’s had access to the Developer forum.  Those were in my opion the good ol’ days of SRL but let’s make a vote on what to do thats the democratic method of doin this. hah I was tryin to get Vbulletin on my server but i ran out of time messin with it tonight think i got something messd up in my config and it keeps screwin up atm.  I already have a PhpBulletin on it but i dont really like it.  but someone make a poll and let’s figure this out.</p>

<p>  Iv been talking to Fawki about this,  we didnt really solve nething but I have unused webhosting already and i was thinking about taking the SRL Main Page and moving it to my hosting, then maybe making a SRL Developer’s only forum but keep all the SRL Members, and all that other junk on Mopars or somewhere else.  I do not have time to handle everything but i will make time to handle the Developer’s and keeping SRL a quality include.  Mopar is doin a great job and im glad he set these temp forums up for us but i’m thinking if we had our own seperate private forum just for the developer’s it would be more secure and we could all be more confortable posting our private works there and discussing private SRL matters there.  Now to the bringin in more SRL developer’s i think we need to put a complete freeze on new developer’s until the dust settles and then we should poll them in as we did before but they must go thru the same things as before such as a Email with why they should be a developer and a example script of there knowledge.  I will futher discuss the future later this week.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Its entirely up to you guys where you host it, but just so you know you should feel safe posting private things here, not even the global mods can see this boards (except for the global mods that are srl devs) in fact the only people that can see these boards that are not srl devs are two admins, Algas and Waffendennis, I trust them because if I didnt they would not be admins here, and they wouldnt have been so at kaitnieks either, but again its up to you <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>Iv been talking to Fawki about this,  we didnt really solve nething but I have unused webhosting already and i was thinking about taking the SRL Main Page and moving it to my hosting, then maybe making a SRL Developer’s only forum but keep all the SRL Members, and all that other junk on Mopars or somewhere else.  I do not have time to handle everything but i will make time to handle the Developer’s and keeping SRL a quality include.  Mopar is doin a great job and im glad he set these temp forums up for us but i’m thinking if we had our own seperate private forum just for the developer’s it would be more secure and we could all be more confortable posting our private works there and discussing private SRL matters there.  Now to the bringin in more SRL developer’s i think we need to put a complete freeze on new developer’s until the dust settles and then we should poll them in as we did before but they must go thru the same things as before such as a Email with why they should be a developer and a example script of there knowledge.  I will futher discuss the future later this week.</p>

<p>I figured the pm system would be most effective, but I guess it will be up to who takes entries over, I guess we will wait for the final decision once SRL closes down for good and everyone comes over here</p>
