    <title>Help with duping ASAP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-duping-asap/360905</link>
    <description>Hey gies, finnally got my server up, its been running great, but one of the players brought somthing to my attention. He showed me what he calls a &quot;x logg glitch&quot;. when a player attacks another player, then stops attacking, then the player he stopped attacking attacks him, and when that player dies, they loog out and when they logg back in, there&#39;s 3 times the amount of whatever item laying on the ground, including the original item in the first players bag. Can anyone tell me how to fix x logging(wich will solve this problem?) and also, regualr duping works too... can anyone tell me how to fix that too? thanks so much to anyone who helps.</description>
