<p>Hah, simple for me. Not for you, or anyone else, or they would have done it by now. You do realize that the NPC updating process is nearly identical to the player? This could be (and is) used for players without any change of code at all. Why would I login 20000 players when I could type a simple command to simultaneously spawn twenty thousand NPCs to test the same results? You say this isn’t useful? Try to spawn over 255 players in any server, and the client will crash. If it doesn’t, then you will only see the 255 players closest the left side, not nearest you, or even perhaps in winterloves case 255 random players based on ID in your region.

No, your information is incorrect. Please show me some pictures if you’d like to prove otherwise.</p>
<p>OT: This is my first post (or visit, not counting using the deobbed client resources) in months. I thought maybe this community wanted members doing professional work? Seems the opposite from your (The only way I can think to term it?) defensive (To what, I have no idea.) responses.</p>

<p>tl;dr: You’re retarded. Please refrain from posting.[/quote]I’m retarded? You’re an idiot. If you spawn 255 “players” and the client crashes, your server sucks. Second, you should be updating in portions. I bet you had to really increase the buffer size for reading and writing data, didn’t you? Third, obviously the NPC updating is nearly the same. I should know because I’ve actually written a server from scratch that had both NPC and player updating. All you have to do is change how many bits are read for the player and NPC list, which is originally (and supposed to be 8). You’re not cool and shouldn’t be proud for changing a number.</p>

<p>Very simple. All you have to do is modify how the player updating works. Besides, it’s not like it’s good or very useful to have this. Also, in your video, you’re spawning NPCs, not dealing with players (Unless I didn’t watch for long enough)</p>

<p>Hah, simple for me. Not for you, or anyone else, or they would have done it by now. You do realize that the NPC updating process is nearly identical to the player? This could be (and is) used for players without any change of code at all. Why would I login 20000 players when I could type a simple command to simultaneously spawn twenty thousand NPCs to test the same results? You say this isn’t useful? Try to spawn over 255 players in any server, and the client will crash. If it doesn’t, then you will only see the 255 players closest the left side, not nearest you, or even perhaps in winterloves case 255 random players based on ID in your region. Either way, rendering your game unplayable.</p>

[/quote]I’m retarded? You’re an idiot. If you spawn 255 “players” and the client crashes, your server sucks. Second, you should be updating in portions. I bet you had to really increase the buffer size for reading and writing data, didn’t you? Third, obviously the NPC updating is nearly the same. I should know because I’ve actually written a server from scratch that had both NPC and player updating. All you have to do is change how many bits are read for the player and NPC list, which is originally (and supposed to be 8). You’re not cool and shouldn’t be proud for changing a number.[/quote]<br>
If you spawn 255+ players with any client, it will crash. The size of the list (As you said above) is eight bits. I fail to see how your logic determines that your client will not crash (Log you out, and throw a T2 error) if you overflow and the client has 255 unexpected update blocks (y). You only have to update in portions if your buffer is overflowing. Tiny NPC update blocks wont be doing that. FYI: This entire server is from scratch, obviously.</p>
<p>What I got from your above post (The random statement about upgrading the number of bits used…) is that you completely misunderstand the entire concept of rendering the closest 255 players. I do not in fact change the protocol or buffer size in any way. I am only rendering 255 entities in either update block. I update starting from the origin, in this case being the actual player. If you watched the video, I spawned multiple layers of NPCs on the same land block and you can see the area of NPCs being displayed shrink, as they grow in density. My server sided buffers have a length of 5000, which is the same number as the incoming buffer in the client. The client used to make the video is the unmodified client from <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://moparisthebest.com</a>.</p>
<p>tl;dr: Your argument is invalid, and I advise you to actually look at the entire video before reposting.</p>

        <p>Yes, I am aware of that. The point I was getting at is you shouldn’t be spawning more than 255 players in the first place, hence blaming the server.</p>
<p>Perhaps I did misunderstand. I didn’t know you were updating like RuneScape by showing the closest to you (I did from the video but that’s not what I thought you were showing off).

<p>Benchmarking player updating to npc updating is completely different. You aren’t testing the “same results”.</p>
<p>If you have 1 player logged in, with those “twenty thousand” npcs you said you could spawn (all in the same region as the player logged in), then those npcs will only be updated for that player, since there’s no point to updating an npc apart from displaying it and it’s actions to any players that are in the region. However, if that was twenty thousand players in the same region, they will all be updated for each other, since they will all be in each others’ local player list; that will prove to take <span class="bbcode-b">much</span> more time.</p>

<p>He may have loaded 2000 players, but if you notice, the area the players cover takes up the entire minimap. He has no sort of code rendering the closest 255 players. I cant tell exactly whats going on without the code, but he either spawned less than 255 players per rendering area, and they’re placed randomly, hence the gaps, or he just is using the normal method of player updating and random players (once again based on their player id in the list) are not being displayed.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry, but after reading over the posts made by Java`, I think that a few major corrections are in order here.</p>
<p>First off, as many other people have said, player updating and Npc updating, while similar, are NOT the same thing. There are differences, and someone could easily have support for insane amounts of Npcs while not supporting a full 2k players. You cannot claim that you have 2000 oranges and them show us tangerines. They are similar, but they aren’t the same.</p>
<p>The problem with doing Npcs instead of players is that, as Primadude said, the player updates their Npc list for all the Npcs. If you have a bunch of players, for example 255, each of those 255 players must be updated for the other 255 that they can see. This means that player updating processing power increases exponentially, while the Npc updating is not. You also fail to take into account the processing power required by the networking to read and write packets to the players, so this topic is very misleading.</p>
<p>The other problem is that you are not first to ‘benchmark’ this. Frugooscape Ultimate was the first server I know of that had thousands of players on a server at a time, and he did not release any information about this. Graham then posted a topic with 2,000 of my AGF bots connecting to Hyperion, showing the memory and CPU usage of the server. This is probably the first thing that you would consider a “benchmark”, although you didn’t post any CPU/memory usage for the server while you were doing this.</p>
<p>[center]<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://www.allgofree.org/blitz/pics/2ktest_vps.png" title="2ktest_vps.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://www.allgofree.org/blitz/pics/2ktest_vps.png" alt width="690" height="443"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div>[/center]</p>
<p>Then, I performed a test on my Blitz base with 2,000 bots idling at random locations in the Castle Wars arena, which went perfectly. That can be viewed on YouTube at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzXz6hvfhc4" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">2000 Players on Blitz</a>. However, many people believed that this was not a true reflection of my architectures sheer power, and believed that making the bots perform actions would cripple the server. So in response, I performed the same test, but at the end of the video I made the bots perform random walking and talking actions. The server held up fine, it was my friend’s router that crashed, as he was connecting the 2k bots. That video can be viewed on YouTube at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRhHGFAR5so" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">2k Players Part 2</a>.</p>

<p>Now, regardless of how incorrect your main point may be, you are the first I’ve seen to use a distance algorithm in order to show players that are closest to the player. This is it works on RuneScape, so I can give you credit for that, and you can see that mine is seemingly random unless you can see the code, although I may change it to use distance as you do with Npcs.</p>
