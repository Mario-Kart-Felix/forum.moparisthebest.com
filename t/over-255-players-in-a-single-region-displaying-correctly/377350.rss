    <description>I believe I&#39;m the first to attempt it? Only took a few lines of code. (Plus a region system) kthx.

              <p>splitting regions that have over 255 players into subregions would end up being much more deficient since the region contraction would have to be relative to each player. either that or subregions are, at times, shared…which kinda defeats the point of splitting it up anyways. if he’s using a proper rectangular expansion algorithm, there’s no real benefit in contracting a region either way (whether it has too few players or too many). so my assumption is just as valid as yours; you can’t call mine ‘wrong’ since you haven’t seen his system, and likewise i can’t call yours wrong either. regardless, as i said, he’s entire system is shitty as fuck</p>

<p>You’re not making any sense. He said he’s using resizeable “region” structures, yes, but do you really think he means that the range of a region grows as more players are added?

[/quote]wow holy shit you are such a retard…a runescape region is 32x32 (which i assume would be the default size of his regions) and by “resizable region” i assume he means that if no players are in the exterior rectangular perimeter of the region, the region will be contracted until reaching a player. regardless, that has no relation to the flaws i pointed out</p>
<p>anyways his entire system is shitty as fuck[/quote]<br>
Calm down.</p>
<p>Yes, a local player/NPC can be up to 32 tiles away. My point was that your assumption is wrong. What benefit is there to contracting a “region” that has fewer players. Now, contracting a region because it has more players has its benefits, since you can potentially reduce the amount of iterations. If you need me to elaborate, just say so.</p>

              <p>Java`, what you haven’t seemed to take into consideration is when player A is visible to player B but player B is not visible to player A. This happens when player A is surrounded by players on BOTH sides, while player B has little to no players on one side, but does have towards the side player A is at. In the following picture, each red dot indicates player A and player B respectively and the black dots (or lines :P) indicate surrounding players:<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/11n4w.png" alt width="532" height="370"><br>
Notice how player B’s visible radius is much larger than player A’s since player B has no players to its right.</p>
<p>This is a huge problem in, say, the wilderness, where player B is able to attack player A from afar with magic or range and player A will not even be able to see player B. This is where it all falls back to prioritization, which is how the actual Runescape server handles it. Needless to say, creating a system that fully emulates Runescape’s is not the easiest of tasks.</p>
<p>Also, I don’t really see how you are having trouble with performance, this is more than easily accomplished efficiently.</p>

<p>Very simple. All you have to do is modify how the player updating works. Besides, it’s not like it’s good or very useful to have this. Also, in your video, you’re spawning NPCs, not dealing with players (Unless I didn’t watch for long enough)</p>

</aside>
<p>Hah, simple for me. Not for you, or anyone else, or they would have done it by now. You do realize that the NPC updating process is nearly identical to the player? This could be (and is) used for players without any change of code at all. Why would I login 20000 players when I could type a simple command to simultaneously spawn twenty thousand NPCs to test the same results? You say this isn’t useful? Try to spawn over 255 players in any server, and the client will crash. If it doesn’t, then you will only see the 255 players closest the left side, not nearest you, or even perhaps in winterloves case 255 random players based on ID in your region. Either way, rendering your game unplayable.</p>

Why? The sorting algorithm involved is no different with players then it is with NPCs. He already showed us one, no need to prove the other.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>The problem with doing Npcs instead of players is that, as Primadude said, the player updates their Npc list for all the Npcs. If you have a bunch of players, for example 255, each of those 255 players must be updated for the other 255 that they can see. This means that player updating processing power increases exponentially, while the Npc updating is not. You also fail to take into account the processing power required by the networking to read and write packets to the players, so this topic is very misleading.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Also, I’d like to add that Npcs don’t have things such as appearance updates, all you need to send is their ID. When you are constantly running around between players, their appearance needs to also be sent when they are added to the client. This is only one of the many differences, but I hope you can see why they are very different things, regardless of the fact that he might use the same algorithm to find the close players.[/quote]I am very well aware of the differences between both, I just said that the implementation of this sorting algorithm is the same for both. As he said, this wasn’t a benchmark test to see how fast his implementation performed, it was just a show-off of a feature he believed to be innovative.</p>

<p>Very simple. All you have to do is modify how the player updating works. Besides, it’s not like it’s good or very useful to have this. Also, in your video, you’re spawning NPCs, not dealing with players (Unless I didn’t watch for long enough)</p>

<p>Hah, simple for me. Not for you, or anyone else, or they would have done it by now. You do realize that the NPC updating process is nearly identical to the player? This could be (and is) used for players without any change of code at all. Why would I login 20000 players when I could type a simple command to simultaneously spawn twenty thousand NPCs to test the same results? You say this isn’t useful? Try to spawn over 255 players in any server, and the client will crash. If it doesn’t, then you will only see the 255 players closest the left side, not nearest you, or even perhaps in winterloves case 255 random players based on ID in your region. Either way, rendering your game unplayable.</p>

There is also the more obvious reason, which is that this is not worth implementing, considering the majority of servers don't even reach 255 players in total, let alone in a single region.
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/ry60003333">@ry60003333</a> The concept is still the same, and the appearance block is only sent once, unless the player’s appearance actually changes.</p>

<p>Why? The sorting algorithm involved is no different with players then it is with NPCs. He already showed us one, no need to prove the other.</p>

<p>The problem with doing Npcs instead of players is that, as Primadude said, the player updates their Npc list for all the Npcs. If you have a bunch of players, for example 255, each of those 255 players must be updated for the other 255 that they can see. This means that player updating processing power increases exponentially, while the Npc updating is not. You also fail to take into account the processing power required by the networking to read and write packets to the players, so this topic is very misleading.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Also, I’d like to add that Npcs don’t have things such as appearance updates, all you need to send is their ID. When you are constantly running around between players, their appearance needs to also be sent when they are added to the client. This is only one of the many differences, but I hope you can see why they are very different things, regardless of the fact that he might use the same algorithm to find the close players.</p>
