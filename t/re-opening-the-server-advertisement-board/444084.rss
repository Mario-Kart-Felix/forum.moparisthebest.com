    <title>Re-Opening the Server Advertisement Board</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/re-opening-the-server-advertisement-board/444084</link>
    <description>I have brought this up before but it has always been instantly shot down from people.

This board would be great for servers to advertise on and try to grow their player population or website population (as in forums for their server). It would also bring a new board which would draw large amounts of posts due to how much people want to advertise their server. These new people using this board would then continue to view other sections of moparscape, such as downloads and tutorials. I think we would see big use of the board because a lot of people do not like the status page the most because it is hard to get noticed on.
Also, People are constantly posting advertisements for their servers all over the forums. They would now have a board they could post in and not break the rules.

The issues with this possible board have always been the moderation which I think could be handled easily. The staff members are worried about people abusing the board. I feel the only big issue that could happen with this board would be people posting their server over and over again.

Thank you very much for reading this through,

-Marcbob

They need to make it so a mod approves the post before its shown, this is due to incase some faggot tries to do a Java Driveby in the webclient and fucks you over. My only issue<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>The tutorial section struggled with this feature, but that was in the past. It is a good idea to have some type of filtering system though, because there is a good chance someone can be infected before a moderator can catch it.</p>
<p>Assign some addition sectional moderators to the section as well if there is a worry about lack of moderation.[/quote]</p>
<p>I can see this being a big problem. Past bad experiences. And its from some of the people everyone knows</p>
