    <title>Some super important questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-super-important-questions/283578</link>
    <description>Ok so I REALLY want to start modelling things but there are certain things I just cant grasp on to:
1.) Animating: Your not really animating it seems as though your just recouloring I dont quite qget this I wanted to make my own animations for my own items?
2.) On things as bows and guns (anything ranged) How do you make them ranged. And for guns how do you make it shoot bullets and make a animation for that?

These are some minor question but there really important that I get them answered so if you are any good please explain some things to me :D PLEASE AND THANK YOU</description>

              <p>And that recolouring ur talking about is telling the client shit. Like the priorites and stuff tell the client the animation points. E.g the arm could be priorities 1 and in the animation it makes all the priorities one go up and then down.</p>

              <p>Tabby, he means make a new Gfx. Not an animation lol. Hes just new enough that he doesnt know the diference yet.</p>
<p>ONTOPIC- alright what i would do is look in RSMV for a model of one of runescapes arrows in the air. And study it in the datmaker for the PRI’s V-Skins and all other stuff. Doing all of that you can create a new Gfx for shooting. 2nd, your gonna need a elplosion at the end of the gun(for good looks). Just look for one of the spells you cast in runescape (i would suggest one that hit the enemy). From there, study the Pri’s and such in datmaker. And Use Meta to make that smaller and make it where your gun barrel will be when it fires. Lastly, you really dont need a Gfx for it hitting the enimy because it is a gun. Unless you made a flame-thrower. Alright well that should help out a little (i have not personally done any of it yet) but it should work.</p>

              <p>Like the animating tutorial I watched just showed him making the skins then he went in dat maker set some pri’s and clicked a default animation I guess thats animating but how would you make it move the way you wanted it to, and on the gun like i wanna know how you make the ammo pouch for ex and the musket work together and since there is no animation for guns how would you make a custom one?</p>

              <p>Not really the info I was looking for I know that and I am modeling but what about the animations you cant do what every animations you want to?<br>
To me it just seems like your recoulouring it and setting it up in dat maker. And how would you go about adding those bullets to your gun. Like maybe if I were to make a musket and then made and ammo pouch for the ammo how would I make the animation for that. That is the type of info I want. And I cant seem to find a tutorial for this stuff so I though I would add it here</p>
