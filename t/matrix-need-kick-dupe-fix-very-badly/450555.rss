    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/matrix-need-kick-dupe-fix-very-badly/450555</link>
    <description>I&#39;m a mod on a server that&#39;s on the first page on rlocus... its in the top 30. At the moment the real owner currently doesnt give a fuck about it &amp; is going to give it to someone else.. we had a player dupe about 500T w/ a mod a couple days ago... we&#39;re losing players constantly, &amp; they dont want to do an ecoreset until this dupe is fixed, but the real owner doesnt want to even work on it... &amp; the new to be owner doesnt have permission. if we could just find a fix to this ;;kick dupe glitch, I have a feeling I could persuade them to do an eco reset... Ive spent 2 and a half months of my life on this server already, really dont want it to shut down like this.. someone help?</description>

I’m a mod on a server that’s on the first page on rlocus… its in the top 30. At the moment the real owner currently doesnt give a fuck about it &amp; is going to give it to someone else… we had a player dupe about 500T w/ a mod a couple days ago… we’re losing players constantly, &amp; they dont want to do an ecoreset until this dupe is fixed, but the real owner doesnt want to even work on it… &amp; the new to be owner doesnt have permission. if we could just find a fix to this ;;kick dupe glitch, I have a feeling I could persuade them to do an eco reset… Ive spent 2 and a half months of my life on this server already, really dont want it to shut down like this… someone help?<br>

<p>Tell the owner to get their FAT ASS UP and do something. Otherwise, tell me his forum name(if they have one) so I can call him a leacher for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>PS: If you truly do care that much about a server and have the respect to, PM me. I’m looking for moderators for my project. We’re not public yet, but the server is online for a closed beta. I can use a mod like you.</p>
<p>But on topic; tell the owner to delete the kick command, if their arrogant self knows how to.[/quote]</p>
<p>Its really hard to contact him :\ he knows how to do shit, but he’s just basically done, probably just because there were SO many bugs w/ matrix’s first release you know… &amp; yeah man, go ahead &amp; add my skype I’ll pm you it. I’m not going to officially leave this server unless it has no chance anymore though… will probably find out in a few days.<br>
Also, I should probably tell you that I’m only 14, but I’m not a squeaker or immature or some shit, you dont have to worry.</p>
