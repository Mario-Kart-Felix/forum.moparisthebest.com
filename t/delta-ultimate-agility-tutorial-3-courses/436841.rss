[b]- Gnome Agility Course
- Barbarian Agility Course
- Partly Pyramid Agility Course[/b]
[size=7pt][i]I don&#39;t find the 4-5-6 floor coords to finish the pyramid. Also rolling stoned aren&#39;t added.[/i][/size][/center]


note: This contains a ticket system, I added barbarian and pyramid tickets to, feel free to remove of course.
To get the barbarian and pyramid tickets since they aren&#39;t in the server:
[b]Client Sided[/b]: open class8.java
Add this with your customs: [b](don&#39;t forget to compile your client)[/b]
http://pastebin.com/zZwegRQy

and in your item.cfg
[code]
item = 7810	Barbarian_Agility_Ticket	An_Agility_Ticket.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
item = 7811	Pyramid_Agility_Ticket	An_Agility_Ticket.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
[/code]


[b]Now go server sided, we are going to add the agility courses.[/b]
[size=7pt][i]If you don&#39;t have grahams task manager implanted in your server.
Do so since this is needed to make the animations fit correctly when using toX &amp; toY[/i][/size]


[b]First make a new java file and call it &quot;AgilityHandler&quot;
and add this code to it. 
Information is added in the code itself, if you don&#39;t understand something, don&#39;t hesitate to ask![/b]

[b]Save and close and make another java file called &quot;AgilityCourses&quot;
Add this code to it, [/b] [size=7pt]need to use pastebin due character limit[/size]
http://pastebin.com/aV8Mvwdz
[b]
Save and close[/b]



[b]Now we must declare these objects in our object clicking packet to make them work. 
So our action actually happens when clicking on the object.
Therefor open the file where your packets are located. In a normal delta this should be client.java
Search for:[/b] 
[code=java]case 132:[/code]

You should see something like this:
[code=java]
case 132:
			int objectX = inStream.readSignedWordBigEndianA();
			int objectID = inStream.readUnsignedWord();
			int objectY = inStream.readUnsignedWordA();
			int face = 0;
			int face2 = 0;
			int GateID = 1;
			if (!validClient)
				break;
			if (!antiHax())
				break;
			if (debug || (playerRights &gt; 1)) {
				println(&quot;serverobjs size &quot; + ServerConstants.objects.size());
				println_debug(&quot;Object Click: X = &quot; + objectX + &quot;, Y = &quot; + objectY + &quot;, objectID = &quot; + objectID);
			}
			int xDiff = Math.abs(absX - objectX);
			int yDiff = Math.abs(absY - objectY);
			resetAction(false);
			TurnPlayerTo(objectX, objectY);
			updateRequired = true;
			appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
			long time2 = System.currentTimeMillis();
			if (time2 - globalCooldown[0] &lt;= 50) {
				sM(&quot;Action throttled... please wait longer before acting!&quot;);
				break;
			}
			if ((xDiff &gt; 5) || (yDiff &gt; 5)) {
				break;
			}
[/code]


[b]Right under that last bracket add this:[/b]
[code=java]
for (int agilityObject : c.acc.agilityObstacles) {
				if (objectID == agilityObject) {
					c.acc.handleAgilityObstacles(objectID);
				}
			}
[/code]

What we did here is saying:
if the objects id clicked, is an id from the array in our agility class,
then we must check for the action they should execute which is also controlled in our agility class.



[b]Now go to the top of your client class and right under:[/b]
[code=java]
public class Client extends Player implements Runnable {
[/code]

[b]Add this: (this is to call our classes)[/b]
[code=java]
	public AgilityHandler handleagility = new AgilityHandler(this);
	public AgilityCourses acc = new AgilityCourses(this);
[/code]


[b]Now search for this:[/b]
[code=java]
boolean process()
[/code]

[b]In there add this:[/b]
[code=java]
if (handleagility.inGnomeAgility() || handleagility.inBarbarianAgility() || handleagility.inPyramidAgility()) {
			followID = 0;
			if (handleagility.isPassing == true)
				isRunning = false;
			if (absX == handleagility.neededX &amp;&amp; absY == handleagility.neededY) {
				handleagility.resetAgility();
			}
		}
[/code]

This checks all the time if the player is in one of the agility areas.
When he is it makes that you can&#39;t follow players within that area.
When the player is busy with crossing an obstacle it makes that the player isn&#39;t running, so the emote can be properly executed,
and he shouldn&#39;t be able to run while crossing an object anyways.
Then when the player is done crossing the objects (when he&#39;s on the supposed X and Y coordinate)
it resets agility.

[b]Save and close[/b]



Now we need to do one more thing, this is to make that the player can&#39;t start running [b]WHILE[/b] crossing the objects,
for the same reason as above.
[b]Open your clickingMost class and search for:[/b]
[code=java]
case 153:
[/code]

It should look similar to this:
[code=java]
		case 153:
			if (c.playerEnergy &gt; 0) {
				c.isRunning2 = true;
				c.isRunning = true;
			}
			break;
[/code]


[b]Replace it by this:[/b]
[code=java]
		case 153:
			if (c.handleagility.isPassing)
				return;
			if (c.playerEnergy &gt; 0) {
				c.isRunning2 = true;
				c.isRunning = true;
			}
			break;
[/code]

So when the player hits the button to toggle running,
it will check if he&#39;s crossing an obstacle. If he is it will not toggle running.




[shadow=red,left][b]That should be it, for any question please reply.
[u]For haters:[/u]
- conventions are bad
- using process is bad
- to much code

I know this ^ I just started writing this from zero and didn&#39;t look for improvements yet.
I don&#39;t stop you from doing it.
I&#39;m done for today and decided to release this as tutorial, since it&#39;s still a lot better than most servers,
if they even have agility working.[/b][/shadow]



[size=18pt][b]~ BUGFIX ~[/b][/size]

[b]Bug:[/b] When the player is crossing an object he can get stuck.
[b]Example:[/b] When the player is crossing a log and clicks in the middle of the log, the player will be stuck on that spot.

[b]Fix:[/b]
  1. Open the file where your packets are located, in a normal delta this is the client class.
  2. Search for packet 98 which is the forced walking packet.
  Search: 
  [code=java]case 98:[/code]

  3. Add this to the packet:
  [code=java]			if (c.getAgilityHandler().isPassing) {
				return;
			}[/code]

  4. Save and compile, bug fixed. If you find other bugs please let me know.

You still didn’t change serverconstants to server<br>
and Misc to misc</p>
<p>also you don’t have the walktoemote void in your client class,<br>
either it’s declared with different capitals, or you don’t have it, so then I guess you should rip it from another server, since most should have it</p>

<p>You have to change Client c to client c without capital.<br>
It calls your client class, since yours is probably without a capital you also have to write it without capital here.</p>
<p>Same for Misc  you will have to write it without capital, “misc”</p>
<p>“ServerConstants” should be changed to “server”</p>

<p>Actually what I was setting up was a way in which it would provide X-amount of tickets on the final obstacle in each course, and then have someone allow the trades for the tickets in the proper interface etc. Right now I am working out the means in which you will only get them by going through each course properly. I liked the idea of rewarding for Agility since I am going to be a server where running is constant (HATE walking lmfao) so there would be no means of gaining Agility otherwise. And for some reason no one I have played with in other games likes training Agility. I kind of figured it was because most of these games released only has 2-3 courses completed. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

That’s what I meant lol. Like if it were the gnome, you would cross the log, up the net, up the tree, cross the rope, down the tree, over the net, through the pipe and there is where you get the ticket. I almost have it for the werewolf atm, and will be implementing it into the others after I fix my little farming problem lmfao.</p>
