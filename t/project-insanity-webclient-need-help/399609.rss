    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-insanity-webclient-need-help/399609</link>
    <description>Im starting to get frustrated. I cant get a working cache and sprites or whatever for my webclient. If you want to go the website where im hosting its http://evoscapez.webs.com/index.htm  I really need help on the whole getting cache to work with the webclient. I&#39;ve used the search and looked at plenty of guides on webclients. Even ones specifically for PI but still no luck. Can someone explain what i need to do in better detail or tell me how to get cache working. I am pretty damn nooby at this too so dont go flaming me. Thanks</description>
