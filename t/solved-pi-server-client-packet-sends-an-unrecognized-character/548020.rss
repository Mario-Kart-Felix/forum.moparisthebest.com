    <title>[Solved][PI] Server &gt; Client packet sends an unrecognized character?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/solved-pi-server-client-packet-sends-an-unrecognized-character/548020</link>
    <description>So I decided I&#39;d try to write a custom packet for my server because the current ones won&#39;t do what I want them to. Packet works, except it&#39;s sending an extra character in front of the String I send to the client..

That might sound a bit confusing or odd, so let me show you what I mean.

I send the string &quot;test&quot; to the client using packet 29 (my custom one).
The client&#39;s ONLY job with the packet right now is to read it, and print whatever is in the String.
This is the output:
[code]
♣test[/code]
The character before &#39;test&#39; isn&#39;t in my code. I don&#39;t really know where it came from.

Below is my code. I&#39;m using (of course) a 317 PI server with a renamed 317 client. The client is loading extra/custom data but that shouldn&#39;t affect anything.

Server sided:
[code=java]packetTest(&quot;test&quot;);// To test if it works.[/code]

[code=java]	public void packetTest(String s) {
		synchronized (this) {
			if (getOutStream() != null) {
				outStream.createFrameVarSize(29);
				outStream.writeString(s);
				outStream.endFrameVarSize();
			}
		}
	}[/code]
I essentially mirrored packet 253 ([url=https://rswiki.moparisthebest.com/index.php?title=317:Send_message]Send message[/url]) for this because it sends a string to the client. However, my string is for something totally different.

Here&#39;s the client sided code:
[code=java]			case 29:
				String title = inStream.readString();
				System.out.println(title);
				pktType = -1;
				return true;[/code]

And I changed the packet size to 6 (same as send message I believe.. could be wrong).
I might have forgot a step when making the packet, but everything seems correct.

Note: unrecognized because when it printed in eclipse it printed as a box and question mark.

[b]Edit[/b]:
It seems I had the packet size incorrect. Changing it to -1 seems to have corrected the issue.

Silly me.</description>
