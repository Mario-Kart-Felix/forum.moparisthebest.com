    <title>I HATE linksys wireless router, can&#39;t get portforward to work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-hate-linksys-wireless-router-cant-get-portforward-to-work/182331</link>
    <description>Well here is my problem, portforwarding like everyone else &gt;.&gt;...I&#39;ll explain what all I have and have done. I&#39;ve gotten jdk6u2, compiler and restarter works fine. I have no-ip running and opened port through my firewall and called it purezscape.no-ip.biz. Using the port 43594 and turned my firewall off while trying to get people to log onto my server. I have a wireless WRT54G linkysy router and tried everything I could think of to fix it so people can log on. I failed at it, I have jdk recognized also. I have pictures of my portforward see if I did anything wrong...
