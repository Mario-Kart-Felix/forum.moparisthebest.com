    <description>BattleScape 317.

1: Dragon claws special with the RS 40-20-10-11 formula or w/e. (Not always same hits tho :P, just the formula)
2: *SOLVED* teleall command.
3: Is there any program better than hamachi that basically does the same without or with less limits?
4: *SOLVED* How to add models to BattleScape.
5: *SOLVED MYSELF* How to fix rushing for BattleScape?

Best if you have had some experience with a BattleScape 317 base.
Any helpful links will be appreciated.

[b]Btw: I don&#39;t &quot;need&quot; these, I won&#39;t die if no-one helps but still..  :)[/b]</description>

              <p>BattleScape 317.</p>
<p>1: Dragon claws special with the RS 40-20-10-11 formula or w/e. (Not always same hits tho :P, just the formula)<br>
2: <em>SOLVED</em> teleall command.<br>
3: Is there any program better than hamachi that basically does the same without or with less limits?<br>
4: <em>SOLVED</em> How to add models to BattleScape.<br>
5: <em>SOLVED MYSELF</em> How to fix rushing for BattleScape?</p>
<p>Best if you have had some experience with a BattleScape 317 base.<br>
Any helpful links will be appreciated.</p>
