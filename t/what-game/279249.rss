    <title>What game?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-game/279249</link>
    <description>I just earned some money after working my ass off on sunday, and I was thinking about buying a new game.

So, should I buy Fallout 3 or wait and buy Infamous?</description>

              <p>Having played both, I can easily say InFamous. I found nothing special about F.O.3, and although I own it, I just didn’t think it was nearly as good as Oblivion. I think it might just have to do with the setting, medieval times to me, is much more appealing than a desolate wasteland.</p>
<p>I clocked in about 20 hours so far on InFamous (playing as Good, on Hard), and still have 150+ shards to collect (I beat the game already on the good side, it was 20 hours clocked-in on getting everything besides the shards and beating the final boss on Hard). After I go and collect the rest of the shards I’m missing, I’m going to be doing a second play-through of the game just going at it as Evil Cole.</p>
<p>I’d like to see how drastically different the game plays out when comparing Good versus Evil. Supposedly, the game is much easier if you play the evil route, but I’ll have to see.</p>
<p>Either way, my pick is definitely for InFamous, you will get more than your money’s worth out of it.</p>

<p>meh im being a bit facaetious i guess, but i went into fallout expecting a cool rpg-like game that wasnt much like fallout 1/2 or the elder scrolls stuff, and i liked it. all the people that hated it seem to be oblivion fans who wanted another one of those or fallout 2 fans who wanted another one of those :p[/quote]<br>
the only reason i hated it is the main story line, the idea of an RPG is to be able to do it and then carry on, i loved it up until the final part of the main story where you (cover your eyes children if you dont want to see what happens) have to choose between somebody dyeing and then the game ends and you cant carry on. That just ruined the game for me and just became an FPS instead of an RPG</p>

              <p>i wouldnt buy fallout 3, i personally feel that it was a poor excuse for a game, it really was not an RPG once you completed main story but i dont know what infamouse is so i wont vote just dont get fallout</p>
