    <description>Okay guys, I&#39;m looking to build a portfolio for my web-design and graphics career.
I figure a good way to do this would be to offer my services free of charge (As I know here at Mopar we like to keep the slate clean and stay away from scammers and fraudsters) So let&#39;s get to business!

I&#39;m not going to post any of my resent web-designs on here I&#39;m just going to be posting the ones I do for you guys, to request a website simply fill in the form below. Now remember these are free designs I won&#39;t be putting my best into this but I&#39;ll certainly make sure you&#39;re happy with what you get. As these are obviously going to be used in a portfolio they can&#39;t be a pile of shit, let&#39;s just put it simply.

&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]FORM[/b]
Mopar Username:
Template Theme: (What will your website be for?)
Template Style &amp; Design: (Show me colors/examples/information) 
Pages: (Do you need a forum, Register functions, Pages?)
Skype Name: (So we can keep in touch)
Agree with TOS?: Yes/No (All websites are copyrighted, abuse this copyright and you will be reported.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This thread was created so I could gain a portfolio, nothing else. Sorry if it&#39;s rushed. If people are interested I&#39;ll updated the thread and make it look a little better.</description>

<p>If you’re designing websites surely the client should have some freedom to do what he wants with it? If it’s like a small copyright in the footer or something then yeah sure but what exactly are you’re TOS?</p>
