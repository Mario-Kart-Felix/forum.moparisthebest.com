    <title>Client Jar won&#39;t launch (even when signed)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-jar-wont-launch-even-when-signed/459597</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve followed several guides of which have showed me to do exactly the same thing.

So pretty much, the following.

Output directory is simply placed as my desktop.
Input directory is my client folder.
Manifest-templated is set as client.

I create the jar.. but it does not launch.

So, I figured perhaps I need to sign it?

So..

I placed my created jar as the input jar file.
Jarsigner found in my jdk/bin

Hit generate keystore.
Found my keytool location (in the jdk/bin)
Output is my desktop, file is called certificate.
Done my alias and public/private keys.
Deleted the information below the validity days&#39; 0.
Hit generate keystore.

Keystore file = certificate on the desktop.
I punch in the appropriate alias and key details.
Hit Sign jar.

Jar is signed.. but still will not launch. Any idea what I have done wrong?</description>

              <p>You only need to import the .class files, not your entire client folder.<br>
In JAR maker, your Manifest should read: “Main-Class: client”</p>
