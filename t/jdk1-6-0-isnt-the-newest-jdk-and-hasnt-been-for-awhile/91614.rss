    <title>Jdk1.6.0 isn&#39;t the newest jdk and hasn&#39;t been for awhile</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jdk1-6-0-isnt-the-newest-jdk-and-hasnt-been-for-awhile/91614</link>
    <description>This drives me crazy, everybody acts like jdk1.6.0 is the newest jdk, but it&#39;s not, jdk1.6.0_01 is.  I just thought I&#39;d make my point there.  Maybe everybody will start using the new version now.  Everytime I download something I always have to go and replace all the jdk1.6.0 with jdk1.6.0_01.  Everybody says that this recognizes the newest version of java or whatever...guess what: it doesn&#39;t.  So maybe you guys can get the new version and stop acting like that&#39;s the newest version.  I know it&#39;s small and this is kind of a stupid rant but...I had to clarify that.  Oh and I wasn&#39;t sure which board to put it in because this seems to apply to all of them, so yeah...I picked this one.  jre1.6.0_01 is also the newest java runtime envirement if you were wondering that.

Oh and if you would like to download the newest version of the development kit you may do it here at the downloads page:
[url=http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp]http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp[/url]

That pretty much ends my weirdest rant ever :P.</description>

<p>I’m not sure where you’re seeing this because update 2 isn’t even released yet…You should click on the one that says this:  That’s the same think as jdk 6, it’s just a newer version of it…<br>
