Zyrith RSPS is a new server but myself have alot of experience of managing a server and I am fairly good at programming. The server can handle a good amount of players without any lag if any lag is found we always make sure we find the issue and try to fix it ASAP. We&#39;re also a server which tries its best to get the server working without any bugs. The combat is heavily modified and improved and we&#39;re hoping for PKers &amp; Hybrids to come on our server to try it out so we can have feedback on the server&#39;s combat and fix it to make it suitable for all players. We also have alot of skills working which are rapidly being redone or improved. We also have a couple of minigames and more shall be added. We try our best to keep the server stable &amp; all the players happy.

Working EP System
New hitmarks with icons
FullScreen, X10 hits toggle, F keys &amp; etc.
Working clan Wars (New clan chat to be added soon!)
Quick Prayers &amp; Curses
Most skills working, All going to be redone one (Some have already been redone!)
Lots of bosses like Barrelchest and KBD and more! (Lots more to be added in time!)
Pest Control, Fight Pits, Barrows, Duel Arena, FunPK (More comin soon!)
Flawless switching
Working Hand Cannon with special
Working XP counter
Near perfect NPC &amp; Player clipping
New autocasting
Fairly good modified combat system
Can hold alot of players with lagging!
And many other features which you&#39;ll notice when you login server, wasting time reading this won&#39;t help. ;)

<p>That is literally the only special feature I see and even that isn’t really considered “unique”…you can take a leeched castle wars tutorial and deisgn clan wars easily from that.</p>

<p>Also…</p>
<p>Unique - 1. Being the only one of its kind: the unique existing example of Donne’s handwriting.</p>
<p>So really you can’t call Castle wars “unique” content cause that was originally made in RS. See where I am coming from now?</p>

<p>Didn’t use castle wars.</p>
