    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-ever-read-this-series/187056</link>
    <description>Has anyone read the series &quot;The Tales of Otori&quot; if you don&#39;t know by the name then maybe the individual books:

1. Across the Nightingale Floor
2.Grass for his Pillow
3.Brilliance of the Moon
4. Harsh Cry of the Heron
5. The Hevens Net is Wide


They are really good books. Here&#39;s a brief of what they&#39;re about:

Based in Japan medivel. When clans are that were around. 
Tomasu - later Takeo - born into the Hidden clan. Idia Saduma whom hates the Hidden attack the village where Tomasu lives - Mino - Tomasu who was picking berries while the attack was ongoing survives and later finds out he is the only surviver from his family - or is he? - He is rescued from the heir to the throne of the Otori, Otori Shigeru. He is given the name Takeo and adopted by Shigeru. If this interests you then read the books!</description>
