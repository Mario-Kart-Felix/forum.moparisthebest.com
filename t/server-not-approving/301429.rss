<p>Didn’t bump it. Only another person can bump your topic, if you’re the last person to have posted.<br>
Economy is the wrong term. You mean community. Economy = community of stock and trade.</p>

              <p>ok ik if i can help but make sure your server is log-onable, like make sure if you are using no-ip that it works and others can log onto it, also make sure your server supports the auto account creation by typing in any random username and any random password for an account to be created, if it doesnt support it, then mopar gives u a username and a pass for the account it willbe using to check your server.</p>
