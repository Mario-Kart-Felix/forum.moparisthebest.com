    <description>Although this topic has already been made I believe, I just want to make the discussion different.

If someone was to make a single player version of Runescape, how much should they add and change?  Should it be as minor as the XP rates and Multiplayer options (No friends list, etc), or should it be as huge as writing complete quest lines and adding events (such as random town invasions, Day/Night cycle, perhaps Hunger, etc)

Also leave any idea for one below, I&#39;m interested in what people think about the concept.</description>

              <p>It’s a good idea in theory, although (as it was said before) you’d have to make up for the lack of players with a lot of content, high level of NPC interaction and perhaps new music tracks. (Just my personal opinion).</p>

              <p>Considering the game would become a lot less cooperative-based and more user-interaction based, I feel that the game should make these changes should it become single-player:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Option for different camera angles / views (i.e. 1st person view)[/li]<br>
[li]A much smaller world map.[/li]<br>
[li]Removal of the chat area, assuming no quests would make use of it.[/li]<br>
[li]Less general stores and more specialized shops.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Pros:</span></p>
<p>[ul][li]Less user interaction would lead a player to spend more time with productive interaction towards the game.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Cons:</span></p>
<p>[ul][li]Monetary value over items would become constant, thus bringing the market to a complete standstill.[/li]<br>
[li]Stores to sell goods to would be held in higher regard, as no one wants to travel all the way back to Lumbridge for a simple store.[/li]<br>
[li]Without multi-user interaction, game play would become slow, challenging, and boring after a set period of time.[/li]<br>
[li]There would be no true competition.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>This looks biased towards me being anti-single player. I’m absolutely, by no means, against a game like this. In fact, I’m all for it and would try it out.</p>

<p>As pointed out, instead of having real time characters to be the driving force for how others can achieve bigger goals, you would need to go down the route a game like Fallout has taken in that you have a large quest base with multiple endings and a way to keep the player hooked, things like running for 15 minutes to get to a place should be their but also have an alternative such as the travel interface in Fallout which saves some time but you lose any interaction you could have had on the way their.</p>

<p>although, the multi-player platform function is to interact with different people having friends, being part of a clan, asking for help, trading/helping with certain items and having help with quests. furthermore, the economy. it’s controlled by the players, and if it’s just a single player version, your going to have to think this through.</p>
