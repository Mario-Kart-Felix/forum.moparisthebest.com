    <description>I&#39;ve been thinking about single-player based games lately, which has led to my idea to work on a single-player RSPS. The concept of this is pretty much straightforward and will involve a lot of questing and exploring, but in a different fashion than RuneScape originally introduced. There will obviously be a lot of work required, such as:

[ul][li]Removing any multi-player content[/li]
	[li]Adding new armor and weapons[/li]
	[li]Adding new monsters and npcs[/li]
	[li]Possibly creating new maps[/li][/ul]

There will be many more things implemented, but this is still just an idea. Before I actually start working on this, I was wanting to get feedback about it. If you have any questions/comments, please post them.</description>

<p>O.K. you’re right. Is that what you want to hear? Can we stop this now? You and I both know why I said that and what I meant.</p>

There was no release, nor do I even expect to see one. It would be so much easier just working on a new game of your own rather than creating a ‘new’ game from something that already existed.</p>

The fact that you are “good” at client and server development is completely irrelevant here, all you need is a good project, and a renamed, documented client. I’m thinking about starting something like this with a client somewhere from the 194 to 317 revision. I’ll just have to do the renaming myself if I can’t find a good client that’s already been released.<br>

if you think good is irrelevant, then we have a team already!<br>
Let’s hop in the help section and gather em all together to do this![/quote]not everyone in the help section are idiots :rolleyes:</p>
