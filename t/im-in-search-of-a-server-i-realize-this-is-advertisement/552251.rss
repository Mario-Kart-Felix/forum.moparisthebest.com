    <title>I&#39;m in search of a server (I realize this is advertisement)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-in-search-of-a-server-i-realize-this-is-advertisement/552251</link>
    <description>Well I&#39;m really looking for a decent 317 based after 07. Not hard to find for some but for many it is.. I and about 4-5 other friends recently got done playing a server shut down/eco reset without a reason after the owner said no reset would happen. we would like to find another server with decent xp rates (somewhere in the middle) a good eco and fun atmosphere. Please leave out lost-isle as we have all already been there and decided against it. All suggestions are welcome but please don&#39;t hate :(</description>

              <p>I’m locking this because it’s not really an advertisement, but a request for a server to join. You can look through the threads in this section to find a server that you believe suits your needs. Beyond that, there’s no functionality on this forum for that sort of thing, save for the advertisements page.</p>
