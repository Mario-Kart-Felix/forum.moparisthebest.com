    <title>T2 126 error [PI/Refactored]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/t2-126-error-pi-refactored/464387</link>
    <description>I have been getting t2 126 errors in my client cmd prompt but I&#39;ve been ignoring them until now. I did this: [url=http://www.runeserver.com/runescape-development/rs2-client/tutorials/317853-renamed-finally-maybe-way-fix-your-t2s.html][RENAMED] Finally maybe a way to fix your T2&#39;s[/url]
And it turns out that I have 3 lines in RSInterface.java that give the errors. I&#39;m sure this connects to server sided edits which is why I posted it in this thread. The lines that give the errors are:
[code]addText(18139, &quot;Talking in: Not in chat&quot;, 0xff9b00, false, true, 52, tda, 0);[/code]
[code]addText(18140, &quot;Owner: None&quot;, 0xff9b00, false, true, 52, tda, 0);[/code]
[code]addText(21050, &quot;Combat Level:&quot;, 0xff981f, true, true, 52, tda, 0);[/code]
They are all in the method &quot;initialize&quot; in Client.java, whether the line(s) be in another method in another class or just directly in the initialize method. Could anyone give me any tips on what might be the problem? Thanks in advance.</description>
