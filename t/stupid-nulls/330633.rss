              <p>Okay, well personally I dont like using Silabs Client either but I just used to so the nulls showed up as heads instead of tiny seeds… I use Galkons Client and it seems to fix most of the nulls, including skillcapes, zammy, sara and guthix armor(s) so for the rest I just have to find the models and stuff?</p>
<p>Btw: I have ran this server before for a couple months and had 300 + people and everything worked fine so I fianlly decided to start it up again and im having a lot of problems, I love this source but I would hate to change to a different source and edit everything again, because i moved a lot of things and eddited most of the souce I have now.</p>

              <p>first of all this is client side, and you probably leached a source, the nulls are items not added to the client. so you need need to add all of the models and ints for each item that you want in your client.</p>
