[B][U]Features:[/U][/B]

[ul][*]Fishes and banks monkfish at the Piscatoris Fishing Colony
[*]WebWalking between runs
[*]Solid breaking system (by Echo_)
[*]Multi-player support
[*]On-screen progress report
[*]SRL Stats
[*]Fail-safes to ensure endurance![/ul]


[B][U]Anti-bans:[/U][/B] 

[ul][*]HumanMouse
[*]Camera rotating[/ul]


[B][U]Requirements:[/U][/B] 

[ul][*]Swan Song quest
[*]62+ Fishing
[*]Small fishing net (Can be bought from banker)
[*][U]You MUST have the absolute newest Reflection 2[/U], get it [URL=https://github.com/Drags111/Reflection_Dev/archives/master]here[/URL].[/ul]


I noticed no one made a monk-fisher so I thought it&#39;d be a nice one to have, even if it&#39;s rarely used.  Very simple script, took me around an hour or so because I had trouble with NPC banking. (This is also my first script that deals with NPCS:))

Because the size of the script exceeds the max characters limitations, I can only post a link to the original post, there you can download and use the script.  View the original post here: http://villavu.com/forum/showthread.php?t=64319

Suggestions/Progress reports are more than welcome!</description>
