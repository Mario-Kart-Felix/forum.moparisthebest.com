    <description>Well I dled WILDERNESS witch was made by Goodbye RS, Hello RSPS, and he has an anti-leech on his WILDERNESS client which makes it so when you login your screen is black. I Asked him on Msn and the hints he gave me was, it was server side, and in the animation file. Any Ideas? I REALLY REALLY REALLY want this :(, ive been bugging him for 5 hours straight and now he wont reply. I dont understand why he would release something and put and anti-leech on the client so you cant even login.</description>

              <p>He put that there so people can’t copy his client easily.<br>
We will not help you get past an anti-leech because it was put there for a reason. If you cannot remove it yourself then you shouldn’t be able to edit it.</p>
