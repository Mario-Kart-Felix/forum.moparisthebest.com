    <title>Items on correct slot</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/items-on-correct-slot/426749</link>
    <description>Ok guys, I just started to learn java. I always wanted to code my own server, so after reading thread in here I downloaded a [PI] server &amp; client. It was 90% clean base. 

I added a bit of coding to my server.

Now when I wear morrigance, not only it doesn&#39;t have the correct bonuses, the coif goes on to the shield slot.

I saw a thread explains the slot problem but it was for delta, and I tried it, it didn&#39;t work.

 Can anyone help me?</description>
