    <description>Ok. DO NOT just say &quot;its in your client.java&quot; or &quot;its in ur &quot;texthandler&quot; because I kinda know that. I just want to change the coords of the &quot;home&quot; tele. It&#39;s called &quot;Edge teleport&quot; atm. I know how to make it say &quot;Whatevermyhomeis&quot; But I can&#39;t find the coords. I think it&#39;s due to the fact that it doesnt just tele to one spot, it has multiple spots. So how do I find and edit the coords for that, because I have a completely new home? Please help guys..</description>
