    <title>Mouse</title>

    <description>So I thought this was just a buggy leak of The Sims 3. Sometimes when I&#39;d click to do something, it&#39;d pop up the menu real fast and then disappear. Or if I clicked on an action it&#39;d immediately bring up another menu right under the option.

But now I think it&#39;s my mouse or something.

Sometimes when I drag things it opens them right before dragging them. And working in premiere pro animating some masks, it kept jumping into a new layer of just the mask (which is caused by double clicking the mask itself) when I was trying to move.

So basically every now and them (now about 60% of the time) it double clicks instead of single clicking, and it&#39;s fucking annoying. It also causes a glitch when I click options in a right click menu, it freezes the option on screen and the menu disappears. So I&#39;ll have a little Properties menu option floating around. 

So, do you think it&#39;s my computer? Or my mouse?


EDIT: Ok it doesn&#39;t double click when I drag, but it clicks several times. I found this out making a new mask, I was dragging to make a bezier curve, and every second it placed a new point wherever I was dragging the mouse. Fucking annoying.</description>

              <p>almost certainly the mouse. this is how every mouse ive had that died started dying</p>
<p>if youre cheap, open it up and put a bit of a glue or something on the notch (theres like a little notch that pushes the button down when you click, its probably started to wear out from all your nerdraging and has a little hole in it)</p>
<p>yes, i repair £5 mice. low budget</p>
