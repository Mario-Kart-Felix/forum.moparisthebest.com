    <title>Cannot connect to localhost / 127.0.0.1 with any source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cannot-connect-to-localhost-127-0-0-1-with-any-source/443190</link>
    <description>To start off, YES, i am a noob. I haven&#39;t attempted to code a private server since my server got attacked like 5 years back. I got bored and I decided i&#39;d try and start coding again.

Before I started editing the client and source, i tested out the files to see if they would run, one source ran when i first tried a week agao. But yesterday I tryed running a different source and now neither of them work.

I simply get Error Connecting to Server. I checked all my setting for the client, the port is 43594 both server side and client side. and the ip is set to localhost, i even tried editing the client to allow me to change it ip if it gave me difficulities, ie. be able to change the string server from localhost to my ip address or even simply 127.0.0.1

Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks kindly :)

EDIT: In case you were wondering, the sources I am more focused on trying to get working are Hell-PKz and Nividia, sorry, I can&#39;t find the links though, if you ask me i&#39;ll try harder to find them.</description>

Listen bud, there is always that one idiot who always post’s this kinda crap, and the reason why that is is because somewhere in your either client or source, it has a 0.0.0.0 instead of the 127.0.0.1… either take my advice or good luck Bud…<br>
