    <description>Hello, i know i&#39;ve been posting on here wayy too much asking for coding help from all of you, but you been helping alot and i have been learning some cool coding information.

OK, this time what i need to know: Is it possible to take a delta source and fix all the pkinig so that it is not so glitchy.

-thing is i been coding the origional delta source for like 2 weeks or so to make my server an for the most part it is turning out rly good for me just starting to learn how to code. but i relized that the pking on delta is glitched pretty badly and is not very good pking. I tried downloading exion&#39;s source and client package to code that cause pking looke so much better on it. But i got to looking at it and it is way more confusing to code and i cant figure it out on my own. so i turned my delta source back online. i want to fix the pking so it is not so terrible looking.. CAN SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP ME?(:</description>

              <p>well i didnt rly go into detail cause i figured delta is so well known and all i thought everybody would know when delta pking looks like. well i know if they run you stop attacking, gs’s swinging is up and down not from the side like it should. and the pking on it does not look the way it should to me. im wanting the pking on my server to be pretty much like 2speced. I was thinking it is just cause it is delta but i know it can be changed cause i seen delta servers with perfect pking (like 2speced and united pkz).</p>
<p>but in the mean while untill some body says that know what im talking bout and they know what is wrong, im going to look for a new source that is hopfully not as confusing to code as last couple i looked at… bad part is i been learning to code delta for like 2 or 3 months and i havnt even tried [pi] yet.</p>
