    <title>Theory on 474 client loading on 317</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/theory-on-474-client-loading-on-317/290698</link>
    <description>Okay, so it requests a specific path to load the client from, meaning you need something server-sided in a client handler to help with byte 14, some specific servers point out byte 14.

Now, basic Deltascape would point out the byte 14 the 474 client sends as a null because it was never meant to support anything other then 317. I tryed out with the Battlescape source (broken or not, it will reply) as it used to load a 377 cache it replied with a client handler and byte 14 not being supported..

I think the whole time everyone&#39;s made an attempt we&#39;ve been to busy looking client-side to realize we need to add a support for the client by server-side means. We may need to find a way for byte 14 to be recognized server-side or change it to suit 317 needs. I&#39;m going to take a look between the three caches to see what the major changes were in hope to bring 474 into 317s.

Anyway, this thread is for those who feel up to the challenge or trying. But of course. this is a theory, I may be incorrect.</description>
