[size=20pt][TLS] The Legendary Soldiers[/size]

Hello I have been playing call of duty 4 for awile now and I am starting to get interested in getting a clan together. It wont be anything too seriouse just a group of us having fun and enjoyng the gameplay. The name of the clan is The Legendary Soldiers the clan tags will be TLS. If you are interested you can add me on PS3  my name is Army-Kill.

If your wondering my rank its 32 second prestige. And there are no rank requirements to join, Ill also be getting a mic soon my new puppy chewed mine up when I was sleeping :P

Hope to hear from you, Thankyou for your time.</description>
