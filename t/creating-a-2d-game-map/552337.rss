    <title>Creating a 2d game map?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-a-2d-game-map/552337</link>
    <description>Hey guys, 

I have a very large image which I&#39;m using as my game map/world. The image contains everything the player will see in game including buildings, tree&#39;s etc. The image is being split into 50x50 tiles and each tile has a bunch of flags such as walkable. Entities are being added seperatly. Their location (x,y) is based on the 50x50 tile they&#39;re on however their size can range above 50px if needed.  

Assuming everything is properly optimized and rendering is done efficiently is this a good approach? Splitting a large image into tiles then working on that? 
It&#39;s a 2d game I&#39;m making and I don&#39;t like how some people use a .txt file with numbers representing what the tile should be or how the game map should look. 

This does mean everything will be hard coded. All the object locations, sizes etc. 

What do you guys think? Is there an alternative or easier method?</description>

              <p>Look at how past games have done it. Separate visual from behavioral, always. First decide the size of your tiles, like 8x8 or 16x16. You can have larger tiles made up of these tiles, like retro games often do (every NES/SNES/GB/GBA game), but your tileset base will be made of 8x8 tiles and then the map will be made up of 16x16 tiles, which are composed of 4 8x8 tiles. Your graphical tileset will be a power-of-2 square tileset, like 128x128 and contain all the tiles you need. There is literally no point in breaking them up Zymus suggested.</p>
<p>Next split the game up into maps. Their size doesn’t matter, but it might be easier to keep them square, so maybe 256x256 big tiles (16x16 in the example). Next create a set of 16x16 collision tiles - square, slab, 30 degree slope, 45 slope, 60 slope, etc. Place these over the visual tiles.</p>
<p>When handling rendering, just render the visible tiles around the player and do AABB collisions, with some more technical collisions for slopes and such. Also please, don’t use 50x50 tiles. Remember you’re working with computers, not pencil and paper. For map designing, you can either make your own program that loads and creates your tilesets (easy) or find other tile map making tools out there.</p>

              <p>its fine if you use pixel perfect collisions<br>
if you want to do collisions by tile (info) it can start to get messed up unless you do what zymus suggested</p>

              <p>My implementation is to first have everything as a multiple of the tile dimensions. A 32x32 tile size would allow 32x32, 32x64, 64x64, 128x256, etc. If an image spans greater than that, you start getting weird things.</p>
<p>After that, I chop the image up into chunks of the smallest tile size (32x32).</p>
<p>From here, I construct a palette of all of the tiles that are used for a portion of the map. Your map will not be broken down into regions, then having one master palette may suffice.</p>
<p>Finally, I map the tile to a bitmap type structure, where each cell is an index into the palette.</p>
<p>For example, if you had 3 tiles, grass, sand, and water it would look something like</p>
<p><code>
"palette" : [
    "images/grass",
    "images/water",
    "images/sand"    
];
"bitmap" : {
    "width" : 8;
    "height" : 8;
    "cells" : [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
        [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
        other data here
    ];
};</code></p>
<p>each entry in “cells” is an index into the palette. Then, when it comes time to render, it just looks it up in the palette and draws it. As opposed to having 64x64 instances of your image in memory.<br>
Might not work in your case, but it’s what I’m doing.</p>
