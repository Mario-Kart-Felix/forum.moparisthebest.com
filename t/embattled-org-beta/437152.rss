    <title>Embattled.org - Beta</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/embattled-org-beta/437152</link>
    <description>[CENTER]Embattled is private server in development that is, and always will be FREE TO PLAY. It is being created by the creator of Alcazar (2008). It has not yet reached the Beta testing stages yet, but is steadily progressing. Beta testers are currently being recruited. I&#39;m not going to endlessly list the average features Embattled has, because every topic in this section has done that. For example, nobody really care if I&#39;ve yet to add the dragon scimitar, or added Lumbridge. I am posting only the major and unique updates and future updates. 


[COLOR=Orange][b]Characteristics of Embattled:[/b][/COLOR]

Free to play all features.
Strong and stable economy, which means wealth gain actually takes time and work.

[COLOR=orange][b]The Beta Release:[/b][/COLOR]
Beta will be released in sections to ensure all the features are thoroughly tested, rather than creating a huge world with all content and features, a lot of glitches will slip through our hands. Most content has been developed, it just won&#39;t be all implemented at once. There will be no more than a 1 week gap between versions 1 to 4, however, implementation speed will slow after that. Embattled will be advertised at around Beta Version 10. The versions (and release date) are as follows:

[b]Class System: [/b]
All 3 combat classes (ranger, warrior, mage), accessible by all players and interchangable in gameplay. Also includes equipment favourites for quick class switches in the middle of combat.

[b]Leveling System [/b]
You will have to gain combat experience in your classes, and once you have levelled up a class you will choose to put points on particular combat skills. For example, a warrior can put his attribute points on Accuracy, Power, Resistance, and Defence.

[b]Looting System [/b]
Instead of NPCs dropping items on the ground, their dead bodies are left behind for players to loot.

Still waiting on models and interfaces.

[b]Skills [/b]

[b]Mining[/b]
Mining is the ability to be able to gather resources, minerals and gems from rock deposits. When rock deposits are depleted, they randomly form another type of ore over time. Types of ore are Tin, Copper, Iron, Coal, Titanium, Palladium, Silver, Gold. There is only one type of picaxe which degrades over time and needs repair. Ore deposits are located on the ground and on the walls. They will be more spread over the gameplay area, rather than all in the same place. Gems can also be obtained from deposits. 

[b]Skinning[/b]
Skinning allows players to loot the carcasses of certain animals (Bears, Rats, Wolves, Birds, Dragons, etc). Skinning requires a knife. If a players&#39; skinning level is not high enough they will not be able to loot the NPC and it will be left for other players to loot. Once an animal is skinned, items for alchemy (Teeth, eyes, hair, claws) and crafting (pelts) will be received.

[b]Herblore[/b]
Allows players to gather herbs and other potion ingredients from plants spread throughout the gameplay area. Some plants will poison the player unless certain precautions are taken.

[b]Fishing[/b]
Gather fish from fishing spots.

[b]Woodcutting[/b]
Gather varying types of wood from trees.

[b]Smithing[/b]
Use ores to smelt into ingots. Ingots are then used to smith weapons, armour, and jewelery. Smithable armour and weapons include sets of Bronze, Iron, Steel, Titanium and Palladium.

[b]Crafting[/b]
Use pelts and other animal products to craft armour such as Wolf, Bear, Leather. Also craft bows.

[b]Alchemy[/b]
Use of an alchemy table to combine ingredients such as herbs and animal loot to create single dose potions.

[b]Cooking[/b]
Cook fish in oven so it can be eaten. Food recovers energy.

[b]Enchanting[/b]
Using souls to enchant armour and weapons at an enchanting table. Enchanting gives armour and weapons an added bonus dependent on the type of enchantment.



[b]Quest Tracking System[/b] 
Track your quests by toggling them to active or not active. When a quest has been toggled as active, the current objective in the quest will be displayed on the screen, including progress. This includes mini-quests in which case it would display, &quot;Kill 20 dragons: 5/20&quot;.

Tutorial quest is started.
[IMG]http://i43.tinypic.com/20r3aqt.jpg[/img]

Tutorial quest is then activated and current objective in quest is displayed up top.
[IMG]http://i39.tinypic.com/2ujhuu1.jpg[/img]

Quest objective is updated in real-time as the player reaches the next step in the quest.
[IMG]http://i41.tinypic.com/25006ir.jpg[/img]

By clicking an active quest again, previous and current steps of the quest will be displayed.
[IMG]http://i39.tinypic.com/idg8c3.jpg[/img]

Tutorial Quest is completed and quest tabs indicated no quests. As well as the number of unfound quests.
[IMG]http://i44.tinypic.com/4zz3tx.jpg[/img]

Menu that displays previously completed quests. Accessed by clicking button in quest tab.
[IMG]http://i39.tinypic.com/2z8sv21.jpg[/img]

When starting a new quest, this menu will be displayed, giving a description of quest, it&#39;s reward. You have the ability to accept or decline the quest.
[IMG]http://i41.tinypic.com/2z7ex44.jpg[/img]

Once a quest is accepted it is added into the quest tab and the amount of unfound quests decreases. Note: the maximum amount of quests at once to have is 5.
[IMG]http://i43.tinypic.com/2419h6b.jpg[/img]




[b]Lockpicking[/b] 
An ability within the thieving skill and is used to unlock doors using lockpicks.

Before the skill is explained, theory behind lockpicking is required. In real-life, a lock on a door has a series pins which all need to be the right height for a door to unlock. Hence why a key is jagged, to rise these pins to their correct heights.

[img]http://i41.tinypic.com/5u4rpf.jpg[/img]

In the game this same system is referenced. On every lock there is 4 pins. Each pins must be set to the correct numerical height. Every failed attempt means a broken picklock, and if any of the heights of the lock are correct, they will glow green. After 5 failed attempts the lock will reset.

[img]http://i40.tinypic.com/35lu3pv.jpg[/img]

Locks are ranged from Easy to Master difficulty. Easy locks have 2 heights, 1 or 0. Medium have 3 heights, 2, 1 , or 0. etc.
If you are a high enough thieving level, easier locks will already have some pins in the correct position to save time.

[IMG]http://i47.tinypic.com/21njjx2.png[/img]



[b]Account Recovery Pin[/b] 
An in-game system designed to recover accounts and keep them secure from unwanted people. Upon your first login you will be prompted to set a 4 character code which will be used later for retrieving passwords and preventing hackers. 

[img]http://i42.tinypic.com/i3w3o6.jpg[/img]

If your account is ever logged in on an IP address different from your last login or the IP the account was made on, the account will be locked until the player can produce the correct recovery code.

[img]http://i44.tinypic.com/5lxyxe.jpg[/img]


[img]http://i41.tinypic.com/ftkfgo.jpg[/img]




[b]Gambling[/b] 
Gambling serves 2 purposes, to entertain bored players, and to balance the economy. Like in real life gambling will have a much higher loss chance than win, however it is all chance. After researching, and even creating a slot machine program, the slot machine feature is ready to be added. Also, the notorious dice among private servers will now be player-vs-player, and the player-vs-computer version will have a variation implemented into the slots as a sub-game to double or nothing the winnings. All too often I have seen servers who have gambling in random places with NPCs shouting and spamming space with their repetitive text. Gambling will just be features in pubs throughout the map, there will be no huge emphasis on it, nor will there be any long term profitting off gambling, due to the payout percentage.




[b]Player-vs-Player Dueling [/b]
Nothing original here as of the implementation of dueling. Just like Runescape, 2 players fighting. Variations will be introduced in later updates.




[b]Anti-Duplication and Monitoring System [/b]
Specifics will only be revealed to Beta testers, because I&#39;d like to keep general public in the dark about the mechanics of the systems. It&#39;s function is to monitor accounts constantly for suspicious behaviour to avoid the advantage of any overlooked bugs or duplications. For example, one of its developed features is tracking what items legitimately go into the game (shops, drops, random events, minigames, etc), counts them, and matches it to the current amount in the game, if the numbers do not match the system will determine which players throw out the balance and lock their account until administrative investigation. The system also tracks trades, drops, etc. This system is still being optimized and locally tested.




[b]Transformation [/b]
The rare ability to morph into an animal for a time to increase various attributes such as run speed, combat statistics, and more.




[b]Highscores[/b] 
You can now search specific players and view their skills levels, experience, rank, and overall levels. There is also a top 10 list. I have seen previously Runescape private servers to view the top 10. But never search for individual players (in-game). Individual skill searches still need to be added as well as player achievements.

[img]http://i40.tinypic.com/9zsobd.jpg[/img]



[img]http://i43.tinypic.com/2116u6w.jpg[/img]






[b]Boundary System [/b]
The Runescape map is vast, and the idea is to keep players in areas only that have been developed. Placing walls everywhere is messy, therefore a system to avoid out of bounds experimentation is needed. This system has areas that players are allowed added into it, which will be updated when a new area is released. If players go outside the area a warning will be sent, if they continue, greater measures will be taken, perhaps death, undecided. Currently however, it is simply mysterious teleportation. An explanation will later be integrated into the storyline.

Players steps outside of intended area and countdown begins.
[IMG]http://i41.tinypic.com/ip84e8.jpg[/img]


Countdown continues.
[IMG]http://i43.tinypic.com/4hu83.jpg[/img]

Countdown ends, before teleporting player back to safety.
[IMG]http://i42.tinypic.com/33otatz.jpg[/img]




[b]Invite-a-friend [/b]
To increase the players playing Embattled an invite-a-friend system will be added to encourage players to invite new players, and receive rewards. Limitations will be in place.



[b]Achievements [/b]
Achievements will allow players to go deeper into the game play by completing a vast list of challenges of varying difficulty. Rewards for challenged are yet to be decided, possibly challenge points will be awarded, allow purchasing of 2x XP for an hour items. It will also be implemented into the in-game highscores so players can compare.




[b]Random events [/b]
Would rather keep specifics of idea to self. Shall be a surprise when Embattled is open.




[b]Learning Spells [/b]
Magic will be rewritten. As an alternative to having an exclusive class system, I have decided that all classes are available to everyone, however magic is a hard skill and depends on alot of factors. Spell learning items must be obtained and learnt before a spell can be cast. This item may be a quest reward, drops, etc. This will make magic harder and more interesting. New spells will be implemented into the standard spell book.



[b]Class Special Abilities [/b]
Each class has their own spellbook, full of unique special abilities with requirements. For example, a warriors spell book will allow him to cast a range of buffing and melee attacks, where as a mage has access to magic attack from distance and self/player healing. All classes have the ability to use the stat lookup ability which can be cast on any player at any time to display the stats/levels of their other classes. This is to ensure players don&#39;t attempt to fight a fellow level 50 warrior, to have him switch to a level 90 mage mid combat. On a side note: For Mages, magic spells are now solely dependent on the staff they are using. If a mage class is unarmed they will cast a minor spell automatically when they attack. If they are using a water staff, they will cast a water spell automatically. So there are no runes, and a mage DOES NOT have access to any melee attacks.



[b]Basic Tutorial[/b] 
Compulsory tutorial which is part of the main quest must be completed upon creating a new account. You are a thief breaking into a kingdoms armoury, for reasons not yet given. Regardless, the tutorial goes as such. Keep in mind, this is a basic tutorial, not really a unique feature, but I have been asked to keep this updated, and so I shall.

Collect items from supplies crate.

[b]More coming soon...[/b]

 

These are just a few of the features that are/or will be available, and as of yet, not extensively tested. 

Beta testers are required. As are developers (refer to top of post).

Hey man! I’m trying to keep up with the rumors going around right now! I keep hearing you’re going to be releasing a beta very soon with a lot of changes and improvements?! I need confirmation from you man! I’m getting excited over here! <em>Crosses fingers</em><br>

<p>Hey guys, a basic beta version will be open to public in the next week. It will have only a few core features for testing to begin with, and updates will be quickly added in succession during the testing. The features which will be available for testing this week:</p>
<p>-Transformation: Ability for players to turn into certain NPCs in combat, and have access to NPC specific attacks.<br>
-Dungeons: Players form a party to fight through dungeons of varying difficulty, including a loot share system.<br>
-Transportation: Alternative to teleports in which players are turned into a flying NPC and flown to destination.<br>
-Invasion: A random event/minigame in which the server is notified of invading enemies, the server is rewarded for participation with event-only items.</p>
<p>These are the 4 main features that will be tested in first beta. Keep in mind the client will be a bit rough, but will be improved in coming updates. Also, updates will come in quick succession after the initial 4 features are tested/perfected.[/quote]</p>
<p>Heck yeah! This is why you’re the man. I cannot wait until Beta. Any places I can go to keep up with you and what you’re working on? Or should I just keep popping in here for updates?</p>
