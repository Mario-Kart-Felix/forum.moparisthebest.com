    <title>Things we hate about MMORPGS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/things-we-hate-about-mmorpgs/428194</link>
    <description>I hate how most MMORPGS allow everyone to do the same quests, I mean really is the NPC so rich and has such a large spider infestation in his basement that he can reward every adventurer to go kill 10 of them?

Would it really be that hard to introduce a quest/task system that generated random quests throughout the world and give them to one player at a time. 

Quests should also expire if you go offline, I mean really the mans house is full of rats and he needs someone to remove them why should he rely on the lazy fuck that disappears from the world?

 I will say that I enjoyed world of Warcraft guide quests had been enjoyable because only one group at a time could preform them, but really that lazy night elf druid needs to be awaken with the horn everyday by multiple people?</description>

yeah, ive never seen one with a large playerbase integrate the players very well. even with some of the smaller ones, it’s not always easy for newer players to get involved</p>

So you could have multiple servers within different time periods. One server could be a full RP server, with constant watching by people to keep the ideas of being IC in check. Then, things that happen in that one server would affect new things in the other servers. Maybe if a player wrote a book describing a creature long dead in the old server, a player could dig that up in the server farther in time.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Frell, post:30, topic:428194”]Not alot of people quest in WoW unless they don’t like dungeons or pvp. Dungeons are boring until 80 because at 80 the boss fights get significantly harder and you have to start getting good at timing and dodging rocks falling from the ceiling or a blast wave etc. Its really the raids that tell the story. When wotlk came out everyone rewatched the lore of arthas killing his father, and at the end of the final patch the ice crown citadel raid explained how he was killed and who took over.</p>
<p>I find that even if I don’t read the quests I will get a jist of what is going on in that area between the factions, but its still boring. Id save questing for games like skyrim really, where theres actually a story to tell.</p>
<p>EDIT: Actually spel since cata there are tons of quests that now have cutscenes and voice acting. At the start of cataclysm youre on an entire shipride with a general speaking to everyone about what may happen, and then a sea monster attacks etc. The voice acting is really good, its just the body animations are a bit lol. Honestly I think you may have stopped playing WoW too soon, pvp right around 60 really starts to get interesting, youre then able to fly everywhere on a flying mount which makes gathering alot easier and so are quests if you do them, at 80 dungeons start to really get strategic, and 85 raids are much harder 25-40 people on one boss trying not to be killed. And as we talked before boss doesnt just mean lots of health in wow, which I really enjoy (at 80 at least)[/quote]PvP without consequences do not interest me. If i cannot die and lose all my items, it feels meaningless.</p>

              <p>Not alot of people quest in WoW unless they don’t like dungeons or pvp. Dungeons are boring until 80 because at 80 the boss fights get significantly harder and you have to start getting good at timing and dodging rocks falling from the ceiling or a blast wave etc. Its really the raids that tell the story. When wotlk came out everyone rewatched the lore of arthas killing his father, and at the end of the final patch the ice crown citadel raid explained how he was killed and who took over.</p>
<p>I find that even if I don’t read the quests I will get a jist of what is going on in that area between the factions, but its still boring. Id save questing for games like skyrim really, where theres actually a story to tell.</p>
<p>EDIT: Actually spel since cata there are tons of quests that now have cutscenes and voice acting. At the start of cataclysm youre on an entire shipride with a general speaking to everyone about what may happen, and then a sea monster attacks etc. The voice acting is really good, its just the body animations are a bit lol. Honestly I think you may have stopped playing WoW too soon, pvp right around 60 really starts to get interesting, youre then able to fly everywhere on a flying mount which makes gathering alot easier and so are quests if you do them, at 80 dungeons start to really get strategic, and 85 raids are much harder 25-40 people on one boss trying not to be killed. And as we talked before boss doesnt just mean lots of health in wow, which I really enjoy (at 80 at least)</p>

              <p>[quote=“Frell, post:28, topic:428194”]Its great because the WoW lore is already written, its very easy to get filled in on the events.[/quote]The biggest issue with mmo’s is the actual presentation of storyline elements. No game does it particularily good (except SW:TOR). Walls of text are no fun, make it actually enjoyable to read (or add cutscenes with voice-acting), and more people would get into it.</p>
