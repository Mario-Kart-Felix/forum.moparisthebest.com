    <description>1)

a) A charge of 10 coulombs flows through a motor in 30 seconds. What is the current flowing through the motor?

b) A heater uses a current of 10 A. How much charge flows through the lamp in: 
i) one second. ii) 1 hour

2) An electric motor drives a water pump that lifts water out of a well that is 10 m deep. It can deliver 360kg per minute out of the tap at the top.

a) How much potential energy is given to the water each second? Hence, what power must be provided by the electric motor? Assume that the motor and pump have 100 per cent efficency.

b) If the motor is designed to run on 12 V, what current will it take out of a 12 V supply when it is working?

c) If the motor is designed to work on 220 V, what current will it take out of a 220 V supply when it is working? (NB the 220 V will be an alternating current supply, but this does not affect the calculation.)

d) Name one advantage and one disadvantage of the 220 V system over the 12 V system.

3) Explain the following observations:

a) You rub a plastic pen with a piece of dry kitchen paper, and then put it a few millimetres away from a thing stream of water flowing from a tap. The stream of water is affected by the pen.

b) You rub an inflated balloon on a dry piece of cloth and hang it from the ceiling using a piece of sewing-thread. You rub a second balloon on the same piece of cloth, and find that it repels the first balloon.

c) The variable resistor used to control a toy racing car stays cold if the car is going at full speed or if the car is stationary. However it gets very hot if the car is going at half speed.</description>
