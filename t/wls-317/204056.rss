Has anyone heard from wL recently? He said in another post (6+ months ago) that he would be finding his old RS client which takes pictures like the above... although I haven&#39;t seen any recent posts by him. I don&#39;t mean to be an ass or anything, but that is a really neat client, I wouldn&#39;t mind to get a look or two at how it&#39;s done. :|

<p>oww, now that brings up ancient memories <em>sigh</em><br>
what a coincidence, and yes, I left, but considering the huge amount of time I spent on hacking and messing with that game, I sometimes come back to see what’s currently going and to to wallow in memories <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> It’s sad, but you cannot just wipe out a non-negligible timespan of your life. And I just stumbled about this game in some magazine, so I thought I’d check what’s…  Oh yeah and I still have tons of stuff to get rid off, but I never really bothered to sell anything (for real $, I mean), so anybody interested in p-hat sets, armies of autoed chars, a bunch of lvl 120+  ;-p… oh sorry this wasn’t intentent to be a show-off post, but now it is and anyways, it’s typical narcissistic winterlove style (we could call that “winterlovesque”) ;P. So, any offers?<br>
Fine, fine, thou shouldest forgive me, but i am spending to much time on writing this damn article about … err … something weird <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ok this has gone far too OT.<br>
Anyways someone should do that gfx hack once the new engine is out … hmm, I smell of a challenge…<br>
But I’m kind of surprised, there’s still wL’s shitty crap floating around … btw, does anyone remember this n00b evo ? (I’m allowed to say that due to certain special common grounds)</p>
<p>So yeah, greetings to anyone who might still know me (n00biness factor requires exclusion of evo), notamment semaphore, kait, and all the dewds from original RS (nowadays RSC) times who very very likely are not going to read this nor does anyone else care, so i better save my time posting names<br>
I might be back in the far or near future with more or less interesting ramblings, codes, hacks, cheats, free stuff, winterlovesque posts.</p>
<p>So long</p>
<p>PS: I know, I still have all that code and I would find that digging through my backup disks, unfortunately it has undergone massive transformations <span class="bbcode-s">and nobody would want to have <em>that</em></span>, so I won’t bother, but I gave that code already to someone else and jagex wouldn’t like to see that thing posted here either</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Comparing all of wL’s previous posts to this one, I find it hard to believe that this is truly winterlove. Maybe you were in a rush or something, but your posts are usually far more structured than this one. This is almost like a random stream of conscience. I’m not saying I know you or anything (just mainly some of your amazing work.), but the writing style seems fishy…</p>
<p>If it really is you, I think it’s wonderful that you checked back in and I apologize for my accusation. It’s amazing that you were able to accomplish what you did so long ago, and people are still trying to mimic what you did. I really do hope to see more from you in the future =-)<br>

Rest assured that the above post was definitely wL. I’ve had many conversations with him and believe it or not, he is a mortal. His typical posts are quite polished… like someone else you know… but that post was raw wL. Besides, he mentioned and hinted about some things that only the real wL would know.<br>

I know evo and I know wL. This is an inside comment between them. Someone outside of us would not know that.

I know precisely who he is talking about...  :D

<p>Having said that, yes it’s unstructured, but he’s not here to make an impression or make a point. So why would it be…</p>
<p>Just his naming of old names etc, it couldn’t be a newfag. Someone must have done their research if it were a fake <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

oww, now that brings up ancient memories <em>sigh</em><br>
what a coincidence, and yes, I left, but considering the huge amount of time I spent on hacking and messing with that game, I sometimes come back to see what’s currently going and to to wallow in memories <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> It’s sad, but you cannot just wipe out a non-negligible timespan of your life.

You’d be surprised as to how popular you are even though you don’t come on as much. If you re-joined any community in relation to private servers, I bet you’d get admin anywhere!</p>

Your server emulator is what just about every “major” project on that site is based off of.</p>
<p>Anyway, nice to see you back on what I imagine is a 1 off post although it would be nice to see you back more often, you’d be surprised how many old schoolers are still about (although the majority are in IRC (although not really, really old more Kaitnieks days as opposed to further back). Feel free to join the IRC for a chat though ofcourse.)</p>

              <p>oww, now that brings up ancient memories <em>sigh</em><br>
what a coincidence, and yes, I left, but considering the huge amount of time I spent on hacking and messing with that game, I sometimes come back to see what’s currently going and to to wallow in memories <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> It’s sad, but you cannot just wipe out a non-negligible timespan of your life. And I just stumbled about this game in some magazine, so I thought I’d check what’s…  Oh yeah and I still have tons of stuff to get rid off, but I never really bothered to sell anything (for real $, I mean), so anybody interested in p-hat sets, armies of autoed chars, a bunch of lvl 120+  ;-p… oh sorry this wasn’t intentent to be a show-off post, but now it is and anyways, it’s typical narcissistic winterlove style (we could call that “winterlovesque”) ;P. So, any offers?<br>
Fine, fine, thou shouldest forgive me, but i am spending to much time on writing this damn article about … err … something weird <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ok this has gone far too OT.<br>
Anyways someone should do that gfx hack once the new engine is out … hmm, I smell of a challenge…<br>
But I’m kind of surprised, there’s still wL’s shitty crap floating around … btw, does anyone remember this n00b evo ? (I’m allowed to say that due to certain special common grounds)</p>
<p>So yeah, greetings to anyone who might still know me (n00biness factor requires exclusion of evo), notamment semaphore, kait, and all the dewds from original RS (nowadays RSC) times who very very likely are not going to read this nor does anyone else care, so i better save my time posting names<br>
I might be back in the far or near future with more or less interesting ramblings, codes, hacks, cheats, free stuff, winterlovesque posts.</p>
<p>So long</p>
<p>PS: I know, I still have all that code and I would find that digging through my backup disks, unfortunately it has undergone massive transformations <span class="bbcode-s">and nobody would want to have <em>that</em></span>, so I won’t bother, but I gave that code already to someone else and jagex wouldn’t like to see that thing posted here either</p>

              <p>yakman created something like the old zooming clients recently if you’re interested.<br>
Works really well. <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,255496.0/topicseen.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,255496.0/topicseen.html</a></p>
<p>As for wL, haven’t seen in ages. I figured he left.</p>

<p>i can’t help you find the wL client, but this is achieved by modifying the camera field values…</p>

<p>Plus removing “tile clipping” or “fog of war” so that you can see multiple regions.</p>
