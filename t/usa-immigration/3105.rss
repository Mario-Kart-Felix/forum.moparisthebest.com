<p>The reason nobody is taking those jobs is because companies don’t have to pay illegal immigrants as much, or give them healthcare, so they make the benifits such that nobody in their right mind would take the jobs, hence the only people who work it are illegals. They are the reason there <span class="bbcode-b">are</span> jobs Americans won’t do, so using that as an excuse for their continued presence here doesn’t make sense.</p>
