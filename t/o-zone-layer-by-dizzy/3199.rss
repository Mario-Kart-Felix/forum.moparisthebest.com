    <title>O-Zone Layer by Dizzy</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/o-zone-layer-by-dizzy/3199</link>
    <description>This topic is already on a couple other sites (all by me). I want to see what people think about the O-Zone Layer.

[s]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------[/s]

Post your thoughts about what&#39;s happening with the OZL (O-Zone Layer) and what you think is causing it to be eatin&#39; away.

My thoughts (very accurate in the science part of it), is that the cause of it is, Co2 (Carbon Dioxide). Co2 is a chemical in the gas of a car (when you breathe in smog from a car-which usually happens if you&#39;re behind the car. You are breathing in Co2, of course that&#39;s bad).

Co2 is poisonous to the human body and to the air. The OZL is one reason for fresh oxygen and cooler tempurtures. So, what scientists say is that if the OZL is destroyed, it will cause global warming. My theroy is that Co2 is depleating the OZL, like how it depleates the human body. What the Co2 does to the human body when you breathe it in is make you sick and you can die from Co2 poisoning (the cause of this is because it&#39;s killing the cells in your body.) So the Co2 poisons the OZL like it would to a human and it destroys the cells that make the OZL. Do you know what happens to a human without cells? [b]THEY DIE[/b]. So a OZL layer without any cells wont work, because it uses cells and molocules (of course), and molocules working by themself is useless.

Post your thoughts about the OZL (O-Zone Layer) and let&#39;s all mass debate about it.  :D  &lt;- JOKE LOL.

Other Info: Co2 can be found in almost any smog/smoke like substance.
Example: When you light a match and you smell that stinky smell from the smoke, it&#39;s Co2.

<p>Good call, but it’s already been addressed. In truth, the Ozone layer has O3 (3 atoms of oxygen per molecule) while the air you and I breathe is O2, two atoms of oxygen per molecule.

<p>Ah really? My mistake, it seemed to me that your post only focused on the issue of our overuse of chemical energy and didn’t really address the fact that CO2 isn’t breaking up the ozone or that the human population is producing ozone depleting products much quicker than the natural environment.</p>

              <p>Wow I hate to be rude but I think there are a great deal of misconceptions being posted on this forum. First of all, the o-zone layer is made up of O3 which is harmful to humans and not breathable. Second, CO2 doesn’t deplete Oxygen, it is cellular respiration that goes through a thorougly long process that breaks down Sugar into CO2 with the use of Oxygen in the electron transport train to create energy. The CO2 that is released from the Sugar is first used to produce those sugars with the help of photosynthesis and thus this cyclic nature has nothing to do with ozone depletion.</p>
<p>The reason why CO2 is brought up during the debate about global warming is as Pwnd mentioned above me. CO2 causes a sheilding effect for the UV rays that generally bounce of the surface of the earth and causes what is known as the green house effect. A green house operates by capturing sun light within the building and thus increasing the temperature of the building with the simple use of specialized windows. The CO2 is acting similarly by keeping the heat in.</p>
<p>What is actually decreasing the amount of O3 in the OZone layer are chlorofluorocarbons that react with the O3 to produce normal O2 and other gaseous molecules. These carbons are man made and in the past were found in refrigerators and cleaning supplies and are continuously used in propellants meaning spray cans of different types.</p>
<p>In response to the belief that the Ozone layer is being depleted quicker by natural sources than by human sources, it has been proven that the Ocean releases HCl that doesn’t reach the stratosphere and the HCl released from Volcanos does not compare to the effect that CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) have on the ozone since not as much chlorine is available to reach with the ozone layer from these chemicals.

<p>

 Ozone depletion consists of two related events observed since the late 1970s: a steady lowering of about four percent in the total amount of ozone in Earth's atmosphere (the ozone layer), and a much larger springtime decrease in stratospheric ozone around Earth's polar regions. The latter phenomenon is referred to as the ozone hole. There are also springtime polar tropospheric ozone depletion events in addition to these stratospheric events.
 The main cause of ozone depletion and the ozone hol...</p>

<p>CO2s part in the O-Zone layer and destroying the earth is by trapping in heat.  If I remember correctly, the O-Zone traps the CO2, the CO2 sits there and repels heat back to the earth.  Now, this is good to an extent, but as you know, not letting some heat out will make it a dutch oven, and it’ll get fucking hot.</p>

Here’s another way to think about it.</p>
<p>All energy comes from the sunlight. Fossil fuels (gasoline, coal, etc.) come from compressed plants and animals that have harvested the sunligh and are trodden down over thousands of years by more plant and animal matter. Human beings mine up the fuel, and use it. We are essentially using thosuands perhaps millions of years of energy in a very short period of time. This causes our earth to get hotter and hotter, and eventually we will bake the whole planet through our overuse of resources.</p>
<p>Instead of doing this, we should be covering the earth in plants to harvest the energy that our sun is constantly giving out. Some plants (for example hemp) can be used for any number of purposes. Alll foods can be synthesised from hemp oil, and hemp makes a clothing that is strong and durable as well as comfortable. Moreover, hemp provides three times the amount of paper as trees do.  It’s only one example, there are an inexhaustible supply of plants that can do any number of things for us.</p>
<p>We should be using natures own natural solar panels to harvest the energy that is coming down from the sun, thus cooling our planet and making it a better place for all.<br>

<p>Well you kinda got it wrong O-Zone is some gay band that made the Numa Numa song<br>
Ozone is what you’re thinking bout.<br>
And Co2 Is what the air always has, your thinking of Carbon Monoxide which is just CO, and you cant breath in carbon monoxide, its the same thing as smoking a cigar and not letting the smoke come out. And the ozone layer doest make oxygen, the trees and plants</p>
<p>So no offense, but i think your in second grade or something ;D</p>
<p>second of all<br>
if the ozone layer depletes completely then the plants would die and so would we except well suffer cause first we’ll get a massive sunburn and when the plants and trees are dead, well, so are we.[/quote]</p>
<p>Actually I do know that Ozone doesn’t make oxygen, I just think that hot air isn’t fresh, lol. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

              <p>Here’s another way to think about it.</p>
<p>All energy comes from the sunlight. Fossil fuels (gasoline, coal, etc.) come from compressed plants and animals that have harvested the sunligh and are trodden down over thousands of years by more plant and animal matter. Human beings mine up the fuel, and use it. We are essentially using thosuands perhaps millions of years of energy in a very short period of time. This causes our earth to get hotter and hotter, and eventually we will bake the whole planet through our overuse of resources.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Dizzy, post:1, topic:3199”]This topic is already on a couple other sites (all by me). I want to see what people think about the O-Zone Layer.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-s">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p>Post your thoughts about what’s happening with the OZL (O-Zone Layer) and what you think is causing it to be eatin’ away.</p>
<p>My thoughts (very accurate in the science part of it), is that the cause of it is, Co2 (Carbon Dioxide). Co2 is a chemical in the gas of a car (when you breathe in smog from a car-which usually happens if you’re behind the car. You are breathing in Co2, of course that’s bad).</p>
<p>Co2 is poisonous to the human body and to the air. The OZL is one reason for fresh oxygen and cooler tempurtures. So, what scientists say is that if the OZL is destroyed, it will cause global warming. My theroy is that Co2 is depleating the OZL, like how it depleates the human body. What the Co2 does to the human body when you breathe it in is make you sick and you can die from Co2 poisoning (the cause of this is because it’s killing the cells in your body.) So the Co2 poisons the OZL like it would to a human and it destroys the cells that make the OZL. Do you know what happens to a human without cells? <span class="bbcode-b">THEY DIE</span>. So a OZL layer without any cells wont work, because it uses cells and molocules (of course), and molocules working by themself is useless.</p>
<p>Post your thoughts about the OZL (O-Zone Layer) and let’s all mass debate about it.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  &lt;- JOKE LOL.</p>
<p>Other Info: Co2 can be found in almost any smog/smoke like substance.<br>
Example: When you light a match and you smell that stinky smell from the smoke, it’s Co2.</p>
<p>~Dizzy (5/22/06)[/quote]</p>
<p>Well you kinda got it wrong O-Zone is some gay band that made the Numa Numa song<br>
Ozone is what you’re thinking bout.<br>
And Co2 Is what the air always has, your thinking of Carbon Monoxide which is just CO, and you cant breath in carbon monoxide, its the same thing as smoking a cigar and not letting the smoke come out. And the ozone layer doest make oxygen, the trees and plants</p>
<p>So no offense, but i think your in second grade or something ;D</p>
<p>second of all<br>
if the ozone layer depletes completely then the plants would die and so would we except well suffer cause first we’ll get a massive sunburn and when the plants and trees are dead, well, so are we.</p>

So, what scientists say is that if the OZL is destroyed, it will cause global warming. My theroy is that Co2 is depleating the OZL, like how it depleates the human body. What the Co2 does to the human body when you breathe it in is make you sick and you can die from Co2 poisoning (the cause of this is because it’s killing the cells in your body.) So the Co2 poisons the OZL like it would to a human and it destroys the cells that make the OZL. Do you know what happens to a human without cells? <span class="bbcode-b">THEY DIE</span>. So a OZL layer without any cells wont work, because it uses cells and molocules (of course), and molocules working by themself is useless.</p>
<p>Post your thoughts about the OZL (O-Zone Layer) and let’s all mass debate about it.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  &lt;- JOKE LOL.</p>
<p>Other Info: Co2 can be found in almost any smog/smoke like substance.<br>
Example: When you light a match and you smell that stinky smell from the smoke, it’s Co2.</p>
