    <description>Hi, Back with another devolopment team request.

My base is CodeUsa for now, new to 508-525 so, starting with something easy.

My other projects I have gave my sources &amp; clients to friends for them to use, I have moved on past delta, but even farther, onto 517&#39;s.

I am using a 508 loading 525 cache, (517).
