    <title>Tile-based to non-tile-based</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tile-based-to-non-tile-based/411748</link>
    <description>my question is, if you start out with a tile-based game and plan on making non-tile-based, how hard/much work would it be to convert?

the reason i ask is:

I&#39;m interest in making a game, probably medieval rpgish. Not sure how to go about this. I&#39;m planning on using client-side: [url=http://code.google.com/p/o3d/]O3D[/url], [url=http://code.google.com/chrome/nativeclient/]NaCl[/url], CSS3, JS, and HTML5; with java, MySQL, and PHP(/JSP?) server-side. With it being packaged as a google chrome web app. To me this is where the future of programs are going and thats why i have chose to use these technologies for development.

media formats i plan to use are webm(audio, and video), and webp(/svg?); idk what to about the 3d models, and maps or any other 3d graphical part of the game. I has hoping 2d, tile-based would be an easier start and working my way up to 3d, &quot;free-roaming&quot;(idk the correct term for non-tile-based but thats easier than writing NTB out). I&#39;m hoping even possibly using voxel graphics if I get that far.

I also thought that cut-scenes could be pre-recorded and streamed for play-back when necessary to hopefully have HD-quality and high fps on a wide range of PCs, instead of having a cut-scene animated on the fly like i&#39;ve seen on a few games(I kinda like that but I think there are some drawbacks when compared to streaming video of the cutscene). 

I was wondering if a cache system, like what jagex uses would be a good or bad idea? if its a good idea should I study that structure etc. (maybe looking at the source for the openRS Cache Library?), or if its not good where should I look to make a caching system for this game?

currently I am reading about opengl(the redbook); reading that should benefit me, but I don&#39;t know how much it will with O3D. I plan on learning c/c++ since atm those are the only 2 possible languages(I haven&#39;t heard what languages they will add in the future, but java would be nice since I know some java.) to use with NaCl. My guess is Ill have to port over an open-source game engine at first then later on possibly create my own engine optimizing it for better performance for my game.

if i do end up making a custom game engine, would it be ok to use it for future games, say like an fps, or racing/flight simulators?

atm im not to worried about the content for the game(my friend, brother, cousin, and I(maybe others depend how life goes) should be able to brainstorm stuff.) as I&#39;m finding what all I need to learn to make a game in the near future. Because i figure that once I know what I&#39;m doing on the programming side, we can get a storyline and the rest of the content worked out.

with that content system I was also wondering if it would be a good/bad idea to make a custom scripting language for use by possible non-programming content-management staff? kinda like what i&#39;ve read jagex uses for their servers so their non-programming staff can add content to the server without programming knowledge.

any information that would get me set on the right track for this would be nice.

if this stuff interest you or something, and you wanted to help me that would be nice( as you can tell I&#39;m not that experienced, but I&#39;m willing to learn), I want to do this for experience, and the fun, idk if there would be money involve or not depends if the game ever was created and made public, but I wouldnt care about the money part.

ive been looking around the forums but since this forum has just been created within the past week or so, I havent found a lot here.

thx for all responses.</description>

<p>ok well im going to be spending awhile learning c++, one im an extremely slow reader, and i get side-tracked easy but ill make it.</p>
<p>update: i have completed reading the c++ tutorial on <a href="http://cplusplus.com" rel="nofollow noopener">cplusplus.com</a> . that helped a lot. took about 10 of pretty much non stop reading but i did it. thats definitely the most i have ever read in one day, but it was worth it, i understand quite a bit that i didnt understand yesterday.</p>
<p>i havent had any practice writing c++ code so any suggestion that i can do to sharpen my ability to program in c++?  would converting apps ive made in vb and c# into cpp be any benefit? i want to improve. thanks for all future help.</p>
<p>tomorrow im going to be reading more about the tile-based games and nacl.</p>

<p>the <a href="http://cplusplus.com" rel="nofollow noopener">cplusplus.com</a> tutorial is ok however it doesn’t go into depth into deeper things like metaprogramming and such. also, why not just take a look at a graphics library (SDL,  SFML, Allegro…) and build your own engine on top of it (may i stress that you should learn C++ to a good level first), you’ll learn more and then you can think about using a full game engine once you’re proficient at game programming (without nice fancy engines) and C++.</p>
<p>protip, the logic behind a simple tile based 2d game isn’t hard! i’d recommend you try and figure it out on your own.</p>

              <p>my question is, if you start out with a tile-based game and plan on making non-tile-based, how hard/much work would it be to convert?</p>
<p>the reason i ask is:</p>
<p>I’m interest in making a game, probably medieval rpgish. Not sure how to go about this. I’m planning on using client-side: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/o3d/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">O3D</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/nativeclient/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">NaCl</a>, CSS3, JS, and HTML5; with java, MySQL, and PHP(/JSP?) server-side. With it being packaged as a google chrome web app. To me this is where the future of programs are going and thats why i have chose to use these technologies for development.</p>
<p>media formats i plan to use are webm(audio, and video), and webp(/svg?); idk what to about the 3d models, and maps or any other 3d graphical part of the game. I has hoping 2d, tile-based would be an easier start and working my way up to 3d, “free-roaming”(idk the correct term for non-tile-based but thats easier than writing NTB out). I’m hoping even possibly using voxel graphics if I get that far.</p>
<p>I also thought that cut-scenes could be pre-recorded and streamed for play-back when necessary to hopefully have HD-quality and high fps on a wide range of PCs, instead of having a cut-scene animated on the fly like i’ve seen on a few games(I kinda like that but I think there are some drawbacks when compared to streaming video of the cutscene).</p>
<p>I was wondering if a cache system, like what jagex uses would be a good or bad idea? if its a good idea should I study that structure etc. (maybe looking at the source for the openRS Cache Library?), or if its not good where should I look to make a caching system for this game?</p>
<p>currently I am reading about opengl(the redbook); reading that should benefit me, but I don’t know how much it will with O3D. I plan on learning c/c++ since atm those are the only 2 possible languages(I haven’t heard what languages they will add in the future, but java would be nice since I know some java.) to use with NaCl. My guess is Ill have to port over an open-source game engine at first then later on possibly create my own engine optimizing it for better performance for my game.</p>
<p>if i do end up making a custom game engine, would it be ok to use it for future games, say like an fps, or racing/flight simulators?</p>
<p>atm im not to worried about the content for the game(my friend, brother, cousin, and I(maybe others depend how life goes) should be able to brainstorm stuff.) as I’m finding what all I need to learn to make a game in the near future. Because i figure that once I know what I’m doing on the programming side, we can get a storyline and the rest of the content worked out.</p>
<p>with that content system I was also wondering if it would be a good/bad idea to make a custom scripting language for use by possible non-programming content-management staff? kinda like what i’ve read jagex uses for their servers so their non-programming staff can add content to the server without programming knowledge.</p>
<p>any information that would get me set on the right track for this would be nice.</p>
<p>if this stuff interest you or something, and you wanted to help me that would be nice( as you can tell I’m not that experienced, but I’m willing to learn), I want to do this for experience, and the fun, idk if there would be money involve or not depends if the game ever was created and made public, but I wouldnt care about the money part.</p>
<p>ive been looking around the forums but since this forum has just been created within the past week or so, I havent found a lot here.</p>
<p>thx for all responses.</p>
