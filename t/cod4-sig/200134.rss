<p>Age affects maturity correct, but there is no talent in anything you people do, if you airbrushed or used a tablet then maybe. Pointing and clicking with premade brushes and filters isn’t talent, it’s a learning curve - one which can be mastered in a matter of weeks (or months).</p>

              <p>I agree with brownsmycard to a large extent. Although he does this point that people need to learn, and be nurtured. Most of the people at my college who do graphics use Photoshop at home, they’re members of graphics communities -  my point is the internet is so full and bursting with people like that the market is saturated with them, 12 year olds who think they’re amazing designers are actually just substandard. <em>THAT</em> is the problem, people overrate themselves in this business. ThAt0n36Uy, you may have sold some of your work, I highly doubt it, but you may have. If it was I would not be surprised if it were just to simple local businesses, that would make sense to me. If you were a “real” designer I would have expected you to have an online portfolio though.</p>
<p>It might interest you all to that making models is a good way into this business and to make cash. Fence panels, walls, doors and household objects (weapons are also overdone). These sort of models (if good enough) can be sold to games companies for small but fair prices which give you a leap into the market. 99.9% of the internet graphics communities make signitures using other peoples brushes, other peoples stock photos and very little of it is original work.</p>
<p>In reply to ThAt0n36Uy’s attack on me, I’ve thrown no power talk into this thread, and neither has fastbawlz who is also a moderator of this section. I have never used my power to swing an argument because at the end of the day I can’t ban you and I don’t care about losing it. (Which is why I often get into these flame wars ;))</p>

<p>How the hell can some of you compare graphics at DA to “large company logos”? The point of a logo is to be simple, and easy to remember/associate with a certain company. Things on DA are made because people want to make art, not lots of money. And the post about things on here looking better than big corporation logos… wow is all I need to say. Complexity doesn’t always mean better.</p>
<p>I have really only seen one single person on here who knows what they are talking about when it comes to graphics, exe.<br>
Oh yeah, thats right, he never posts here because he is sick of the retards here.</p>
<p>99.9% of every single graphic ever posted in this forum has 0 thought in it, 0 planning, 0 effort and 0 skill put into it. Every thing here is all crap any kid can do who has never used photoshop. After 10 minutes of messing around any kid can mix a couple of filters together on an image and create the same crap that is posted here every single day.</p>
<p>Please for the sake of this forum (worst type of community for grapics ((kids who want to cheat at a gay game))) put some damn thought and effort into things when you post them. Also, ask your self whether it is or is not worthy of being posted.<br>
-Do you want to actually get better, receive comments and criticism.<br>
-Do you want opinions and new tips?<br>
-Will someone either remember or value what you made?<br>
-Will it provoke thought or opinion.<br>
-Or is it a cluster fuck of filters that look cool to no one but yourself…</p>
<p>Really, I would find far more interest in a blank white square with a yellow rectangle in the center, than 99% of the shit posted on here. Simply because it wasn’t made to be a "look at what cool buttons I can press to make this over complicated, filtered piece of crap!. A piece such as that wouldn’t be about showing off their photoshop talents, but instead would have needed more thought and concept.[/quote]</p>
<p>If you don’t like it here GTFO. If you want your so called ‘images’ criticized correctly, go somewhere where you feel you will be accurately critiqued. I don’t want to hear your shit. No one said anything else about Deviantart. I could fucking care less about deviant art. All deviant art is, is a portfolio for people who like to create images as a whole and share them with others. Do I fucking care what you have to say about this board? I don’t fucking post my work here you dipshit, you want to know why? It’s because most of the people here don’t know jack shit about image creation.</p>
<p>What did you fucking add to this argument? Who fucking cares what goes on at Deviantart, or who actually creates images. This is a graphics board for the sake of graphics. If someone wants to fucking post a shitty signature, let them do so. If they want to post a drawing they drew, let them do so. As far as I know, no one asked for your fucking opinion.</p>
<p>I personally don’t give a shit about your images, or whatever else you fucking make. So you don’t have to post them here. I’m sure some moparscaper will give it a 10/10.</p>

</aside>
<p>No, it’s not that you got butt raped. It’s that Greeny has no argument. He resorts to swinging his ‘power’ around as a fallback. He obviously doesn’t understand that we are graphics designers, to some degree. I am a graphics designer, I do make images, I make logos, I do all sorts of things that I must start from a blank canvas. I sell images, I make a profit off of my images. So therefor, my work makes it into the ‘real world’.</p>
<p>Magma is no help to this argument either. He does not make images. So there’s no point for him to be here. He is only making the argument more one sided.</p>
<p>The only thing that needs to be said is that Greeny has no place in the graphics section. If he wants to include himself, he can do a better job than he is doing now. He may have power over the board, and freedom to post in whatever board he likes. But the truth is, he doesn’t belong here.</p>
<p>There is no argument here, it’s been blown way out of proportion. Goatee, and I are right.</p>

<p>Go to deviantart, that makes me go wow all the time.[/quote]</p>
<p>I used to like Deviant art before it got hoarded with crap, there is still a lot of good stuff on it though.<br>
However Magma is right, most professional companies now you use basic logos, advertising etc.</p>
<p>If anyone here had a real keen interest in Graphics then they would know that. Look at modern companies:<br>
Google, Tesco, Yahoo, YouTube, LG, Microsoft, Sony etc etc</p>
<p>The difference, Deviant art is mostly non-professional work/portfolios. Makes very little profit. The big companies of today, and the upcoming companies of tomorrow however are worth millions/billions and keep it simple.</p>

<p>Piss off, all of you. This topic wasn’t made for flaming, or arguing over who is better at graphics. I would rather this turn into an <span class="bbcode-i">opinion</span> thread (like Greeny’s opinion on graphic masters, etc) than a flame war. Please, give an opinion, or get lost, arguing isn’t helping. If this persists and Greeny isn’t around to lock it, I will have a GM do so. This is your last warning.</p>

I &lt;3 graphics kids.</p>
<p>All I care about is whether it looks good and to me, everything but the text looks just fine.</p>
<p>What you people forget is in the real world no-one gives 2 shits how much time and effort went into something. I don’t do PS anymore, it’s just a world full of 12 year olds with huge egos. I think some of you try to be overly critical simply because you believe you are much better.<br>

<p>Yes, all the people designing things for movies, TV shows, clothes, etc. are a bunch of 12 year olds.</p>

<p>No you got the point completely wrong, I’m saying these faggots think they are like these people. IE, they beleive they are going to become graphic designers because they can make some fancy looking signiture shit that has 99999 layers and more bullshit applied to it than fat whores face.</p>
<p>I have no head or ass, so i can remove none from either. I’m a blob.</p>

<p>Not really true at all. The only people who respect the work that goes into an image are the people in the biz. Like other graphic designers. I work at my church doing things in the tech field.

<p>Check out the world of “ART” not sig whores. Art is widely appreciated when its made to be art, not something personal, such as a sig. Look at the most popular things on deviant art. They get thousands of comments because people appreciate the effort put in by people that create images to portray a thought, theme or message. Appreciation by peers only comes when the work is more than “oo look at what a cool image I can makez0rz!”.</p>
