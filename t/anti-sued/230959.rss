    <title>Anti-Sued</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anti-sued/230959</link>
    <description>Hi. ive noticed at alot of people are getting sued bye jagex on 508 servers, this is because they have not put any barriers to stop jagex from strait out sueing them. take frugoo for instance. they are currently being sued for ALOT of money, as i understand it the owner of frugoo is under 15 years old...

To stop your server getting shut down and you getting sued for alot of money just put some or all of these into place.

1. Make your own client! (im not saying make it from scratch but at least download it and get your users to use it). with controll of the client you are using you can put security in place, like putting an agreement page b4 the download like moparscape and silab does.
2. Make a website for your server!! if they have to sign up on a website and agree to your terms (like that they are not and never have been a jagex employee) then if they try to sue you you can counter it and they will back off.
3. simply on your client put in visible clear writing &quot;BY ALOWING THIS CLIENT TO LOGG IN YOU SURRENDER ALL LEAGAL RIGHTS AGAINST [YOUR SERVER NAME HERE]
4. if you think jagex are on to you and that you have no counter strikes against them sueing you shut down your server and your no-ip and change your IP, keep it off untill you are SURE that jagex have backed off.
5. there are alot of jagex kiss ups out there!! if you make terms and conditions to joining your server then make sure you specify that by signing up they give up legal rights against info they may find on your server/website.

if any1 has any more things that could help o protect other coders then please post and i will add, dont worry guys, we WILL beat jagex :)</description>
