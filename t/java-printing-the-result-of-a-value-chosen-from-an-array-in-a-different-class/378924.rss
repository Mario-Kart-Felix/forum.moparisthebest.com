    <title>Java - Printing the result of a value chosen from an array in a different class?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-printing-the-result-of-a-value-chosen-from-an-array-in-a-different-class/378924</link>
    <description>Alright, I am working on an old garbage server and I am having some trouble with checking if the value chosen from an array is a certain value or not.

I asked a few people and came up with that I should use a for loop. I came up with this:

[code]for(int z : Item2.NPC()) {
    if(z == 995) {
    PlayerHandler.messageToAll = &quot;Coins&quot;;
 } else {
    PlayerHandler.messageToAll = &quot;Something else&quot;;
    }
}[/code]

I came up with the error:
[code]NPCHandler.java:1245: foreach not applicable to expression type
for(int z : Item2.randomNPC()) {
                            ^[/code]
The array is in the Item2 class. Here is the array:

[code]    public static int NPC[] = {995, 1000};
    public static int randomNPC()
    {
    	return NPC[(int)(Math.random()*NPC.length)];
    }[/code]

This is just an example from the server. My main question is: Is there anyway to check the value chosen from an array, and if it is a specific value, print a message? Please ignore any convention errors or code that is written wrong for now, this is an old old server.</description>

<p>You were arguing about using an (Array)List. I’m saying a better solution is to use a HashSet. Even if the benefits are insignificant in this case, it’s still good practice.

Just trivial stuff, but the method asList() accepts varargs, meaning you could do asList(4151, 995). Also, it makes more sense to declare it as a Collection. Like I said earlier, something like this is not what I would call “cleaner”. Less lines is all it is. The point of an ArrayList is that it’s dynamic. I would rather use a plain array.</p>

<p>it’s not actually clean per-say. the code has just already been written and you just use one line to access it. you can do this:</p>
<p><code>public boolean contains(int[] array, int value) {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++)
        if (array[i] == value)
            return true;
    return false;
}</code></p>
<p>then access it with one line too, however the latter doesn’t build and populate a new collection</p>

My point is that it does make a difference, as you have just demonstrated. Your first claim was that the bytecode is the same. With the if-else statement, the astore instruction appears twice. With the ternary statement, you only see it after the compare block.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>yeah i know that was your point i kept trying to edit my post to say you were right but my school internet is acting up, well it’s edited now.</p>
<p>they still go through the same exact process though, none is faster than the other (i still agree with you).</p>
<p>i guess the benefit of ternary is that it makes things shorter and also since it is one sequence this is possible:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">obj.setValue(bool ? "yes" : "no");</code></pre>

<p>My point is that it does make a difference, as you have just demonstrated. Your first claim was that the bytecode is the same. With the if-else statement, the astore instruction appears twice. With the ternary statement, you only see it after the compare block.</p>

<p>yeah i know that was your point i kept trying to edit my post to say you were right but my school internet is acting up, well it’s edited now.</p>
<p>they still go through the same exact process though, none is faster than the other (i still agree with you).</p>
<p>i guess the benefit of ternary is that it makes things shorter and also since it is one sequence this is possible:</p>

              <p>I have to do this for seven NPCs, so would Davidi2’s method be the most efficient way to do this? I have different ways working but the amount of code that is required is ridiculous considering some NPCs will have 10-15 identified drops. I’ve send Davidi2 a PM about an error on his way, but if I need further help on it I will post in this thread again.</p>

<p>That’s right.</p>

<p>You are trying to call a function in class Item2 called NPC(), but there isn’t one is there?  Only a field, so this will compile:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">for(int z : Item2.NPC) </code></pre>
<p>Got it?</p>
<p>As for what you are trying to do, of course you can print a value from an array.</p>
