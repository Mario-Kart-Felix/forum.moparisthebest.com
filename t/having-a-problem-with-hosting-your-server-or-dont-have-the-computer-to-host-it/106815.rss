    <description>Do you have a server you want to share, but dont know how or dont want to have a computer on 24/7?

Well I have a fios connection with 15mb up 7mb down and I am willing to host someones server for them. Im not expecting a great server. I just want to help a newb out and host it for them.

You may think it would be hard to update your server. I understand you might think that but just keep reading. Here are the steps I will do with someone.
1. email the .rar or .zip of the whole server to me (email later on message).
2. I will email you back the easy info on how to connect to it.
3. I will put a tiny text at the top right saying &quot;Hosted by Bullstriker&quot; so i can get at least some credit.
4. If you have something you want to change, mess with copy you have then email the files that you changed to me and I&#39;ll put it on.

You can email me at the same adress for adding a mod or something. I am definantly not a newb at working with mopar/java so ask me anything.

I just wanna help out someone who is close to nuking there computer :P .

Email -- blake@Bullstriker.com
AIM -- MegaGodCow (dont email, just IM)

So far I am hosting somebodies right now, please no more requests.</description>

              <p>saying that you “wont steal it” wont get people to just GIVE their source to you, because you might steal it, thats why no one trusts people that asks for their sources so they can host ETC.</p>
