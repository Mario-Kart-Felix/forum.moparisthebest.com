    <description>You think we will ever achieve it? And if so, what do you think we could do? Could we do whatever we want in Virtual reality? Or just play our favorite games feeling the enviroment around us.

<p>For virtual reality you need to be able to walk around (obvious, huh?). That’s a problem atm, I can’t think of a 2d walking machine. A treadmill is 1D, you can only go forward and backwards. You can ‘simplify’ walking around by using brainwaves, but I don’t know if we are anywhere close to using that.</p>
<p>Looking around is quite simple, all you need is VR glasses and optionally IR tracking (optionally because when you use brainwaves you don’t need it).</p>
<p>Feeling will take a while. You’ll need somekind of suit for that. One that is full of little tubes that get filled with a fluid, for example if you hold a stick it fills the inside of your hand with fluid, so you can’t make a fist and it feels as if you hold something in your hand. Fine textures will be even harder.</p>
<p>If you mean virtual reality as in being able to move your head and look around in game, give it a few years.[/quote]<br>
There is something called an omnidirectional treadmill, almost always used in caves.</p>
<p>Smell: Unknown to me.<br>
Touch: Nowhere near perfect, but <a href="http://home.novint.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Novint</a> makes something somewhat close.<br>
Sound: Pretty much any headphones.<br>
Video: HMDs/caves [although IMO hmds will eventually be better]<br>
Taste: no.</p>
<p>I REALLY cannot wait for full virtual reality, it has always been a dream of mine to use it. Perhaps the Emotiv EPOC will help with this?</p>

              <p>virtual reality has already been achieved where a person is in a room and can manipulate an avatar within a program by moving their own body, it was a game like structure where the player was in a room and they had to get out, there was a small hole that they could bend down and look through and objects with which they could use to try and escape</p>
