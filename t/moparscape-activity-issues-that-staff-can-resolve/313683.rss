    <title>Moparscape Activity (Issues that staff can resolve)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparscape-activity-issues-that-staff-can-resolve/313683</link>
    <description>Recently the moparisthebest.com/smf forums have had little activity in posts. I have a theory that this is down to a few things, so I have made a list of the problems and hopefully staff will resolve these issues. 


[ul][li]People join this forum for support, although they don&#39;t get any from other members. All they get is abuse, therefore they are leaving to other communities.[/li]
[li]Moparscape doesn&#39;t offer the best range of achievements and goals, by this I mean only a few members are trying to bring something new out to the public and something they will enjoy.[/li]
[li]Moparscape&#39;s client is out dated, yet I am aware they are making a new client shortly.[/li]
[li]The forums need a good touch, personally I like the default SMF theme but surely there is a nicer theme out there.[/li]
[li]Staff aren&#39;t like they used to be (I am not going to talk about this, some old member possibly know what I&#39;m on about).[/li][/ul]


As stated before, hopefully staff will resolve this problem because the post count has seemed to go down.

Bare in mind, two forums are linked to the same database prefix, therefore most of these posts have been made on moparisthebest.org/smf.

              <p>Why does any of this shit matter? Why does it really matter if the community is dying? (if it is.) Why does it matter about how the staff talks to other members? The thing is, don’t be fucking stupid and break the rules, then you won’t have the moderators tearing you a new asshole. Read the fucking rules if you’re going to be a part of this community. Don’t purposely piss people off by breaking the rules. And don’t get pissed when the staff gets really pissed off at you and swears at you. It’s nothing personal against you when they do it, (unless they know you or something) it’s simply everybody combined that’s fucking stupid in this community. That’s why the staff gets so pissed at everyone. You know that acceptance page where you have to type ‘yes’ to enter the forums where it shows you all of the information you should know? When was the last time that page was actually put into effect and used? Like the first month prior to launching these forums?</p>
<p>Whatever. The reason I made this post was because I was reading what relmitos was putting and I got a little heated that he can’t really show empathy for the staff members.</p>

<p>Oh I enjoy an ironic post from time to time. Let’s see, bullshit and annoyance. Well, the second one is easy. Your post completely derailed this topic, quite a large annoyance for me. Oh yeah, and your post is full of bullshit. Before you go and attack other members, maybe you should look in a mirror first.</p>
<p>Famous American author Nathanial Hawthorne once said “No man, for any considerable period, can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be true.” He is of course speaking of hypocrisy. I think you should take heed to that warning and start speaking with a little more finesse.</p>

He is a repeat offender and needs to be banned or muted to teach him not to flame.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">The life cycle:</span><br>
Someone discovers RuneScape plays it for a while and then cant be stuffed training. They search “RuneScape cheats” on google. They find a link and click it. It says stuff about RuneScape Private Servers, so they go to Google answers and asks what RuneScape Private Servers are and how to start. Now usually people would be pointed here because its one of the oldest forums</p>
<p>[size=9px]This is when i asked about advertisment banners[/size]</p>
<p>[quote=“Taharok”]The neat thing about this community is that it was the replacement to Kaitnieks. Kait was the only RS hacking community out there. All of those people came over this community, making this one the primary hacking community. After MoparScape was created, we also had the only site with only RSPS-related boards.</p>
<p>So anyway, I’ll get to my point. Since we are so old, everyone knows about this site. Any person in the RS hacking scene knows about Moparisthebest, and every person in the RSPS scene knows MoparScape. Outward advertising would be somewhat a waste of money, and impractical. We might be able to get a few new members, but it’d hardly be worth the advertisement.[/quote]</p>

<p>Yes, relmitos, you may be older and much more mature than a lot of the guys here at MoparScape, but am I right in saying you’ve only been here since may?</p>
<p>Some of the guys you’re talking to are respected members of the community, and probably know how things work around here better than you do.</p>
<p>Yes, I admit, I was a little… harsh on that guy.<br>
But you don’t fully understand the circumstances.</p>
<p>That guy was here plainly to annoy people, break the rules, and generally be an inconsiderate twat.</p>
<p>Why should I tolerate that behaviour? He didn’t want to be here, he didn’t want to advance the community in any way, he was just trying to make our jobs even harder than they already are.</p>
<p>As said previously, we are not robots, we are not bots programmed to follow the guidelines and rules perfectly, we have lives, why should I waste my time dealing with guys like him just coming onto the forum to deliberately infuriate people?</p>

You’re an idiot. By posting something as ‘harsh’ as “Try not gravedigging fucktard.” on the thread rather than PM, other members will learn to refrain from doing the same thing.</p>
