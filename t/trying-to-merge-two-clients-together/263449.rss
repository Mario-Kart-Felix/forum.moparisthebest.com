    <title>Trying to merge two clients together</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trying-to-merge-two-clients-together/263449</link>
    <description>Alright, I have got a client that I use for 317 servers and then I have a client that I use for 474(I THINK). What I am mainly wanting is a client for a 317 with the option to change the colors of your chat, working music, a selection of themes, and when someone on your friends list is online it goes to the top. I am needing all of the 317 models on the client. So with all of this said I guess I&#39;m pretty much wanting these two clients merged kinda to go with StonedPK. If I am getting all of this wrong please tell me. I am very new at this kind of stuff. If you make it for me then put your credits on it, I don&#39;t care. I just need a new client. Please help! Thanks.

              <p>Wrong Section, you can’t “merge” clients but u can find 317 clients with 474+ items and looks. Visit the Server Downloads Section.</p>
