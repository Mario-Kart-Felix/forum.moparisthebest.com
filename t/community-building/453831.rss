    <description>As a server we should defiantly be doing more community based builds for everyone, for example general public farms, houses at spawn - the kind of thing that makes someone feel welcomed on a server.

Me and some other people (mainly fuscate) were talking about starting a project near or at spawn in the jungle involving everyone who would meet a simple criteria (your buildings have to look nice).

So basically we have a vision of lots of houses at spawn like a little spawn town which the community would build, you could build a house for yourself and then leave and go and build your own base - a lot like hermitcraft if anyone&#39;s seen that. In the town we could have the general farms much like we had in the old world 1 spawn with the tree farm.

Obviously we don&#39;t want lots of little dirt houses popping up in the village so if this plan works and you decide to build in the town and your house looks bad we will give you a chance to modify it or remove it... Theres gonna be problems with greifing which I have no idea on how to resolve so if you have any suggestions on that then I&#39;d be willing to read. The obvious fix is to have a mod go and rollback damage each day but that could be a pain for them.

I know that this sounds a bit sketchy and a waste of your minecraft career but think about how good it will make the spawn look!

Our current spawn is very ugly and to be honest if I were a new player I would leave straight away after seeing it:

[u]House guidelines[/u]
Because we want this to look nice I&#39;m gonna say that the following building materials/methods are not welcome in the town when we build this:

Cobblestone boxes - you can use cobblestone but don&#39;t overuse it or make sure it looks decent.
A box made with one material from top to bottom.
Dirt houses.
Houses without windows.
Don&#39;t build box houses - they must have shape.
Half cut down trees!!!

When you build you are also responsible for any garden area or paths leading to your house.

[u]The nether[/u]
We should also create a main nether hub connected to the town in which you can then tunnel of to your own portals that take you to your base/ house. This is not important right away but it would be nice to see it done.

Oh, I forgot about this. I intend on building a spleef arena around the spawn somewhere in the near future, I just have to get the time first.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

<p>Will do, do you have big plans for the spawn?</p>

<p>Obviously the staff would need to give us permission to destroy the crap that’s already there.</p>

              <p>I love the idea of a community town where everyone puts a little bit of them self into a large scale project. In my opinion we should try and hold a certain criteria on your own house (has to look visually pleasing, nice on all texture packs not just a single one) etc. A good point to hold is that as a community town, we will hopefully have staff building there aswell and therefore being able to monitor grief and be able to roll it back almost as it comes.</p>
<p>I am more than willing to put a large amount of time into this project and i am sure there are a number of others who will also, so this has my full support and I hope to see it go far.</p>

              <p>As a server we should defiantly be doing more community based builds for everyone, for example general public farms, houses at spawn - the kind of thing that makes someone feel welcomed on a server.</p>
<p>Me and some other people (mainly fuscate) were talking about starting a project near or at spawn in the jungle involving everyone who would meet a simple criteria (your buildings have to look nice).</p>
<p>So basically we have a vision of lots of houses at spawn like a little spawn town which the community would build, you could build a house for yourself and then leave and go and build your own base - a lot like hermitcraft if anyone’s seen that. In the town we could have the general farms much like we had in the old world 1 spawn with the tree farm.</p>
<p>Obviously we don’t want lots of little dirt houses popping up in the village so if this plan works and you decide to build in the town and your house looks bad we will give you a chance to modify it or remove it… Theres gonna be problems with greifing which I have no idea on how to resolve so if you have any suggestions on that then I’d be willing to read. The obvious fix is to have a mod go and rollback damage each day but that could be a pain for them.</p>
<p>I know that this sounds a bit sketchy and a waste of your minecraft career but think about how good it will make the spawn look!</p>
<p>Our current spawn is very ugly and to be honest if I were a new player I would leave straight away after seeing it:</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-u">House guidelines</span><br>
Because we want this to look nice I’m gonna say that the following building materials/methods are not welcome in the town when we build this:</p>
<p>Cobblestone boxes - you can use cobblestone but don’t overuse it or make sure it looks decent.<br>
A box made with one material from top to bottom.<br>
Dirt houses.<br>
Houses without windows.<br>
Don’t build box houses - they must have shape.<br>
Half cut down trees!!!</p>
<p>When you build you are also responsible for any garden area or paths leading to your house.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-u">The nether</span><br>
We should also create a main nether hub connected to the town in which you can then tunnel of to your own portals that take you to your base/ house. This is not important right away but it would be nice to see it done.</p>
