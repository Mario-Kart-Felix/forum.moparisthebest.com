    <description>Hi, I&#39;m looking for a few individuals to develop a base with. I require you be at least adequate with working on java, have database experience, know the internals of how a Runescape client works, and know the basics of git (pull, push, commit, resolving conflicts). Scripting experience is a plus. Inquire here, the official project name is &#39;Cobalt&#39;.</description>

<p>I have your skype already hoe. I mean, it’s not a requirement. I put Lua on my resume under ‘I’ve touched it before’, compared to Ruby though it’s a lot faster and barebones.</p>

<p>No. But I don’t really want to use Java for content. Lua would be great but I’d be open for ideas.</p>

Last time I looked into working with you, I was unable to work out how to create an Item object in Ruby and couldn't find a documentation so I gave up.

              <p>Hi, I’m looking for a few individuals to develop a base with. I require you be at least adequate with working on java, have database experience, know the internals of how a Runescape client works, and know the basics of git (pull, push, commit, resolving conflicts). Scripting experience is a plus. Inquire here, the official project name is ‘Cobalt’.</p>
