    <title>Problem with new Graphics card</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-new-graphics-card/231739</link>
    <description>I just got a cheap Inno3D 8600GT off the net and i&#39;m having trouble installing it.

I&#39;ve put it in my PC, disabled my on-board graphics and enabled the PCI-Express slot. Now, I get a little yellow ? in the icons bar with &quot;Video Controller (VGA Compatible)&quot;. When I go to install the latest drivers from the Inno3D website, I get a message saying that no hardware in my system is compatible with these drivers. 

The weird thing is, just as I turn on my PC, even before Windows starts-up, I get a screen that gives me all the info on the graphics card.

Any help...PLEASE? :)

Solution - Had to manually install the drivers through a modded .inf</description>
