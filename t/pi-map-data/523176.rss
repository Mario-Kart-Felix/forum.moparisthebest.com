    <title>[PI] Map Data</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-map-data/523176</link>
    <description>So I went into Taverly Dungeon and I found all the walls, rocks, decorations, etc...were missing. This isn&#39;t the only place that is missing mapdata, there&#39;s the Coroporeal Beast Lair, Lumbridge, Port Sarim...etc...the thing is I don&#39;t know how to pack the Taverly Map data in. So if someone could help me that would be great. I&#39;m having the same problem as this guy, I looked through his thread but it just says he fixed it, no solution. :/
