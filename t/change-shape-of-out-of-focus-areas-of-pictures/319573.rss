    <description>I just posted this on my site, but I&#39;ll tailor it for you guys.

Here&#39;s an example:
[img]http://somethingtohide.info/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/DSC07632.jpg[/img]

Notice the heart shaped lights? Those are normal Christmas lights.

Here&#39;s what you need.
A dark card. I used the top of a red heart shaped Hershey Kisses box, but you can use construction paper or another type of card.
A knife. I used an exacto knife. Or you could use a hole-puncher type thing.
A camera, for obvious reasons.

Basically, you need to do this:
[img]http://somethingtohide.info/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/DSC07638.jpg[/img]

Whatever shape you cut out will be the shape of your highlights. The shape is roughly the size of a penny.

Then, you need to choose what you&#39;re going to photograph. I did a Christmas tree. You can do anything that&#39;ll give you a unique bokeh pattern whenever you defocus, but lights work best because of the strong shapes they produce, and Christmas trees with lights work best because there&#39;s a lot of lights.

So, get ready to take the picture like normal. Then, hold the card in front of the camera lens, pretty much touching the lens. Get it around the center of the lens. Look through the viewfinder and it should look normal. Then you have to be in manual focus and focus anywhere but on what you&#39;re taking a picture of. The more defocused your object is, the bigger the shapes will be. You should be able to see the shape just barely in the viewfinder, but when you take the picture they&#39;ll definitely show.

As you can see in my picture, the hearts are a little rough, because my cutting skills suck.

Here&#39;s another example.

Everything here was taken handheld with my DSLR. You can do all this with any camera, but since point-and-shoot camera&#39;s lenses are smaller, you might have to make the shapes smaller to get the same effect.</description>

              <p>Kinda. Maybe not as scientific as you want, but the idea.</p>
<p>When the lights are out of focus, the rays from them all reach the lens in different places, more specifically a circle (based on most shutters that aren’t polygonal). Almost the opposite thing that happens with light sources. Small point sources produce harsh shadows (the equivalent to in focus lights) and large light sources produce soft shadows (the equivalent to out of focus lights) because of the ways the rays from the light hit the object.</p>
<p>The lights take on a circle shape normally because the aperture is circle shaped, in most cases. However, some blades form a polygon, so in those cases the shapes would be polygons. The card “cuts” into that circle because it’s extremely close to the aperture.</p>
<p>Kind of like, when you hold a pencil to the ground outside, the shadows are really hard, but when you pull it away, the shadow gets soft. If the card was farther away from the lens, you’d see it in the picture, and the “shapes” would be blurry.</p>
<p>But since the card is so close to the lens, it produces hard edges because the edges of the out of focus lights are cut off from the entire circular area. And since it’s so close, you don’t see it in the picture because it’s also out of focus, to the sensor. It’s so out of focus, it just barely produces a little faux vignetting.</p>
<p>If you held it farther from the lens, you’d see the edges of it in the picture frame, and the shapes it produces would be softer.</p>
<p>You can tell from the picture, the areas around the edges are distorted. It’s harder to explain because I don’t have pictures, but this is because the lights are entering the lens above, below, or from the sides and so it takes on the shape in a different perspective.</p>
<p>Think of it like, if you make a heart cutout, and shine a flashlight through it. If you shine it pointing straight at it, it’ll make a heart. But if you hold it above it and still at it, it’d be a distorted, elongated heart.</p>
<p>Is this making any sense? I’ve taken a few light science classes, so this all feels like basic understanding to me, and I know it’s true because it just feels that way in my brain, you know?</p>

<p>Like I said, you can probably do this with any point and shoot as well. But you’d need to be able to manually focus, or put something really close in the frame, focus on that, and then move it out of the frame.</p>
<p>And the hole would have to be cut smaller. All the point and shoots I’ve owned have had a very small barrel, never bigger than the size of a quarter. So considering the size of a penny is good for a lens that’s about as wide as a cup, you could probably use half of that size to get some results with a PAS.</p>
