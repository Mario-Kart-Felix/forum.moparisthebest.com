    <description>Hello,

Recently I was banned from the status page. To my knowledge I was not breaking any rules at the time. All of our votes are legitimate, we had 99% uptime, and we have been around since September of 2013. I contacted Moparisthebest on the 25th a few times to try and resolve the issue but he has been reluctant to reply back. I am looking for answers, and possibly a positive resolution if it&#39;s possible. 

Jason.</description>

              <p>Thank you for the calm and collective advice as well as help. I can assure you, and any other member of this community that the game I am working on does not promote the sale of staff positions. I will take the steps you mentioned to try and get this resolved,</p>
<p>Thank you  :),</p>

              <p>If you were banned, it’s probably for a reason not just out of the blue (like selling staff positions, etc. etc.)</p>
<p>Sorry bud but you probably won’t get that much of a reply from MITB since he gets spammed with this stuff on the daily but if you want to anyways try talking to Tom (<a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=284102" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=284102</a>) or Zuppers (<a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=101530" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=101530</a>) about it if not, try contacting an active sectional moderator (John would be your best bet) and maybe they will relay your message. If all that fails, I would jump on the IRC (Chat tab next to messages) and hop on <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span>, <span class="hashtag">#moparscape</span>, <span class="hashtag">#help</span> (if that still exists) and shoot a message and wait (keeping the client up)</p>
<p>Keep calm, don’t get mad and say stuff you’ll later regret.</p>
<p>Good luck with your appeal!</p>
