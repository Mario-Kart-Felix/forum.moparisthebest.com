    <title>[562] Experience Rates</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-experience-rates/380944</link>
    <description>Hello.

I need a little help. I&#39;ve been trying to get my server experience rates to be a little slower. I don&#39;t like hitting a 2 and getting 14 levels. 

I&#39;ve looked around several different classes to no avail. I would really like to know which class or even as specific as the void or function that controls it.</description>
