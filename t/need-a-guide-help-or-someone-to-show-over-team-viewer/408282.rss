              <p>[quote=“arham 4, post:3, topic:408282”]Be sure that you put your no-ip in the client and stuff then release it change it back when you released it on the web. So for example:</p>
<p>if I made example.no-ip.biz, I would replace my 127.0.0.1 with my no-ip account. Then, I release it on mediafire and advertise it. As soon as I put it on mediafire I put 127.0.0.1 back  and then advertise. But only put 127.0.0.1 for you, the no-ip should be for the rest of the people. Though you have the source and it will connect normally with 127.0.0.1.</p>
<p>TIP: Always leave your sources “run” command on and your no-ip client on. It helps the connection plus the source will be open so that will mean people can get on it.</p>
<p>TIP: Set your battery setting to not turn off if with charger if your close the lid. Your server can be all night and your battery will e charged for the morning :).[/quote]<br>
Okay do you have teamviewer? So you could show me so i know it for future reference?</p>
