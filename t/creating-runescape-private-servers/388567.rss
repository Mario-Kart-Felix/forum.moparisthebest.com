    <title>Creating Runescape Private servers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-runescape-private-servers/388567</link>
    <description>Basically within the past day I have had an intrest to create my own runescape server, Its getting very stressfull finding the correct sources and client -.-

Anyway I have both a source and a client,
I start the server up and on moparscape I can use it for about 3 secounds and then it logs me out. It does say something about a port being unable to be used but i dont think this is the general problem as it instantly logs me out.

I didnt have much look using no ip either -.-

And the server clearly isnt connected to the client in anyway, I could really do with some help, so please either get in touch with me through these forums and give me instant help on msn messnger?

Many Thanks.</description>
