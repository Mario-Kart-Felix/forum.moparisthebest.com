    <title>Laptop failing to start</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/laptop-failing-to-start/453560</link>
    <description>Iv got a laptop were I load it up the bios and all loads fine but when it comes to actually loading windows or anything its just a blank screen. 

I tried reinstalling windows from a disk and from a USB but it didnt seem to do anything as when I tried booting it all I would get is a blank screen. 
I did a diagnose which showed I have a corrupt Hard Drive. I tried installing windows onto a portal USB but I&#39;m still getting a blank screen. I can access bios fine tho :/

Any ideas? I don&#39;t really want to be spending money on fixing it or getting a new hard drive.

edit: threw it away LOL</description>
