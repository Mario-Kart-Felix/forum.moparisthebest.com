    <description>I tried replacing farming with summoning and added some code in some other places, I messed up, I thought I had removed all of the summoning and replaced it with farming. Now I get errors when I compile. Could you look over my client.java and see if you can fix it? I&#39;m missing a bracket somewhere but I haven&#39;t been able to find it. If you&#39;re willing, send me a message and I&#39;ll attach the file and if you fix it then please send the client.java back to me and on my V2 of my server I&#39;ll give you credits</description>
