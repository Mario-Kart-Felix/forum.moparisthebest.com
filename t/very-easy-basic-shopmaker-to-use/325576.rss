    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/very-easy-basic-shopmaker-to-use/325576</link>
    <description>[center][b]This ShopMaker Is The Best! - It&#39;s very easy to use,
It Tells you exactly where to put the codes you generate!

~ Download link: http://uppit.com/v/C8HRN3VY ~

~~~ I Released this because some people was having problems with the other shopmakers
So i decided to release this awesome shopmaker, because it&#39;s very easy to use and it will
Solve everyones &quot;Shop Making&quot; Problems. :D ~~

*This has no virus at all, scan it yourself, i&#39;m using it myself so it has no problems!*

I Realized that it generates this code wrong:
[code]else if (NPCID == 520) {
	PutNPCCords = true;
	WanneShop = 30;
}[/code]
All you gotta do there is to put an other &quot;O&quot; So it becomes &quot;Coords&quot; Not &quot;Cords&quot;.

It has no sence to release this, 1 you didnt make it. And 2 do you have permission to release it? I don’t think so.<br>
And that’s old stuff, people know how to make a shop in 3 secs without a shopmaker…<br>

<p>1.Do you have proof that some people can make shops in 3 secs without a shopmaker?<br>
2.Everyone has permissions to use this one, as long as you give credits to the original owner for it.<br>
3.It might be old but it’s still easy &amp; working<br>
4.It can be useful for some people.</p>

<p>Shop maker is useless, even when I was first learning to code I never used it. I’d rather make my own shops.</p>

*This has no virus at all, scan it yourself, i'm using it myself so it has no problems!*

I Realized that it generates this code wrong:
[code]else if (NPCID == 520) {
	PutNPCCords = true;
	WanneShop = 30;
}[/code]
All you gotta do there is to put an other "O" So it becomes "Coords" Not "Cords".
