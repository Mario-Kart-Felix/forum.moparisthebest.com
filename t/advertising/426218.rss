you just login with that username and password it gave you on your server<br>

This is false. ^<br>
If you read it clearly it says something like “You’re server will now be checked by logging in with the following User, Password, and IP to check if it is online”</p>

<p>No, your extremely wrong. I posted my server today, it was on the toplist within 5 minutes. I’ve posted many servers and I’ve never had to log in with a user or pass. L2 know facts.</p>

If you read it clearly it says login with this username and password from this ip blah blah… within 24hrs to register the server… its stating you use that username and password and login as a normal character on your server within 24hrs for it to register your server, also you gotta leave your server online for 24hrs</p>
