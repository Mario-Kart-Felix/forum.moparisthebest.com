    <title>Editing my Logo</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/editing-my-logo/413420</link>
    <description>So, I tried editing my logo, I put this random stupid logo for a test that I made in paint.net and paint, but when I put it inn through tom&#39;s cache editor it causes the client to have a failure and I had to replace my whole cache because Tom&#39;s wouldn&#39;t open up the file that the logo is contained in, so what am I doing wrong, and sorry I am new at cache editing so I&#39;m not quite sure how to use it yet.</description>
