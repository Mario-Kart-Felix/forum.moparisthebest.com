    <description>Hi MoparScape,

I downloaded the Apollo 317/377 server and got it up and running, however, I cannot find a client that is compatible with the server.
I have tried at least 5 317&#39;s and 377&#39;s, and they all give me an error message (server sided) stating that the &quot;Secure payload length mismatch.&quot; or &quot;Invalid secure payload id.&quot;. Can someone please link me to a Apollo compatible client?

Here is the repo I am using for the server: https://github.com/apollo-rsps/apollo

Regards,
Nemo</description>
