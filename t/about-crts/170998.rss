    <title>About CRT&#39;s</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/about-crts/170998</link>
    <description>just a few questions I have been thinking about, is it best to use AC current, or DC current on CRT&#39;s (google if you don&#39;t know)
what is the highest resolution possible on a CRT without deformity and using a standard VGA cable &gt;= 60Mhz frequency
how much power do they consume &quot;per pixel&quot;
are they better at seeing at multiple angles compared to LCD&#39;s on average?
if a CRT monitor is emitting a high pitched noise(which hurts my ears and nobody else seems to notice) what does that indicate(as in on th monitor)
which are cheaper to manufacture if using all the best raw resources, CRT&#39;s or LCD&#39;s?</description>
