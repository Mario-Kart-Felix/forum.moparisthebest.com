    <title>Netty and RSCD</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/netty-and-rscd/401973</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been working on Netty on RSCD for few days now, and netty just seems so complicated compared to MINA.

Now I&#39;m almost finished, but I don&#39;t understand shit about decoding and encoding, and I&#39;d need to remake them to work with netty, I tried the ones that xEnt used on his Catalyst emulator, they just didn&#39;t work at all, because he did it with OneToOneDecoder, and what should be used is FrameDecoder(correct if I&#39;m wrong), so if some java guru would explain how the decoders are done and how would I go and make one just from looking at the clientsided code.

Another thing that I&#39;d like to say, while I was working on the netty integration, I decided to split up loginpackets into different thread and process other packets like this:
[code]
		for(Player player : world.getPlayers()) {
			player.ping();
			RSCPacket queuedPacket;
			while((queuedPacket = player.getQueuedPackets().poll()) != null) {
				PacketHandler handler = packetHandlers.get(queuedPacket.getID());
				if (handler != null) {
					try {
						handler.handlePacket(queuedPacket, player);
					}
					catch(Exception e) {
						Logger.error(&quot;Exception with p[&quot; + queuedPacket.getID() + &quot;] from &quot; + player.getUsername() + &quot; [&quot; + player.getCurrentIP() + &quot;]: &quot; + e.getMessage());
						player.getActionSender().sendLogout();
						player.destroy(false);
					}
				}
				else {
					Logger.error(&quot;Unhandled packet from &quot; + player.getCurrentIP() + &quot;: &quot; + queuedPacket.getID());
				}
			}
		}
[/code]
Which will work in same way as processing packets do in RSC.</description>

I got told that it should be used for situations like this, and the main purpose is that I want to learn about networking, not really trying to improve RSCD.</p>
