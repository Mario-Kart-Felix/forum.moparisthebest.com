    <title>Starting moparscapes own linux distro?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/starting-moparscapes-own-linux-distro/393977</link>
    <description>i have thought about making a linux os probably a distro but that plan was later when im more experienced in programming. but just now discovering rainmeter for windows i was like wtf why doesnt linux have something close to that? rainmeter is open-source so if someone was able to port it to linux that would be cool. i know that would probably be quite a bit of work and possibly not possible changing from the windows gui api to one of the linux gui apis.

but i was thinking the distro would have one of the if not coolest gui setup of all the distros. downside would most likely that it would probably be resource extensive. i was thinking it would include programs that do stuff like the ones in the following list(note some programs are already in linux):

[ul][li]rainmeter[/li]
[li]rocketdeck[/li]
[li]compfiz[/li]
[li]live wallpaper[/li]
[li]possibly fences[/li]
[li]etc.(other programs that do cool things with you desktop)[/li][/ul]


also some way to better organize user data. i know its bad practice to place lots of things on ur desktop, but he have to think of the computer gui(desktop) like its a actual desk u sit at. im meaning you work with stuff  then when ur done u put the stuff back in its place. well when i think about it thats how computer desktops are set up but u have to up the folders u want to place things in. i want to just drag and drop stuff without having to configure the computer to do this. btw i know how to do what i just said but i mean programmed in to the os code or whatever not something i actual have to do. not trying to sound lazy but it would make working with the computer more efficient in work flow.

note: i started typing this last night and i got interrupted and when to bed with out finishing it. so i believe im leaving some stuff out.</description>

Bugs? Its the same as the MacOSX except every patch needed for the OS to run on Intel and AMD processors is there, although there is a different CD for each.</p>

<p>idk but it seems to me u are basing if the os is better by how user friendly it is. if u are going that route then windows i would have to say would win that since a lot of development goes into user friendliness. mac os is closed source and is maintained by apple. so user friendliness is going to be greater than some open source community driven os. mac os is installed for u on ur apple computer, windows is installed on ur pc. linux on the other hand can be installed for ur b4 u buy it but that is rare, so u have to install linux urself. if ppl were getting paid as much as a mac os dev, and it was their job to develop a linux distro then linux would be much more user friendly, but i dont think it would be open source or free is ppl had to be paid to develop it.</p>

<p>but i was thinking the distro would have one of the if not coolest gui setup of all the distros. downside would most likely that it would probably be resource extensive. i was thinking it would include programs that do stuff like the ones in the following list(note some programs are already in linux):</p>
<p>[ul][li]rainmeter[/li]<br>
[li]rocketdeck[/li]<br>

[li]etc.(other programs that do cool things with you desktop)[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>also some way to better organize user data. i know its bad practice to place lots of things on ur desktop, but he have to think of the computer gui(desktop) like its a actual desk u sit at. im meaning you work with stuff  then when ur done u put the stuff back in its place. well when i think about it thats how computer desktops are set up but u have to up the folders u want to place things in. i want to just drag and drop stuff without having to configure the computer to do this. btw i know how to do what i just said but i mean programmed in to the os code or whatever not something i actual have to do. not trying to sound lazy but it would make working with the computer more efficient in work flow.</p>
<p>note: i started typing this last night and i got interrupted and when to bed with out finishing it. so i believe im leaving some stuff out.[/quote]</p>
