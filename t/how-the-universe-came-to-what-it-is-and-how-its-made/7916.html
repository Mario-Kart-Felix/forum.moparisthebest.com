<p>How the universe is how it is today!</p>
<p>Well, it all started out with the big bang, right?  Thats partly true, it didn’t first ‘start’ with the big bang, the big bang was actually going on for plenty of eternities.  What?  How is that possible?  Well to understand this, you would have to know something about the 11 dimensions.</p>
<p>=================</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Dimensions</span></p>
<p>0: There is nothing, there is a point of indefinate size, its just an idea.</p>
<p>1: If theres a line, with no width, and no depth, only height, this is the 1st dimension.</p>
<p>2: The 2nd dimension is, well, think about when people say 2D, its the same thing, height, width, but no depth.</p>
<p>3: This is easiest for us because this is what we live in, a 3 dimensional object has width, height, and depth.</p>
<p>4: What we can describe the 4th dimension as is duration.  If you imagined yourself from the time you were 1 minute ago, to the way you are now, the line you could draw between those points in time would be a line in the fourth dimension.</p>
<p>5: If you imagined bending the line of time in the fourth dimension, to meet another point in time, you would do this in the 5th dimension.  In theory, time travel is possible then, and I believe we’re not far from time travel in the future.</p>
<p>6: The 6th dimension holds all possibilities for your life.  If you did something in your childhood that made you famous and rich by now, you would want to see what would happen if you hadn’t, you would do this in the 6th dimension.</p>
<p>7: You can bend the 7th dimension to meet the 6th dimension imitating time travel in a different sense.</p>
<p>8: Forgot…</p>
<p>9: Ah, now I remember, this holds all future possibilities for an infinity.  Subotomic particles vibrating in the tenth dimension make up our vision, what we see.  We cannot view the dimensions above us, so we don’t know whats happening behind the scenes.  If you have looked at all possibilities for an infinity, every single possibility to ever happen in the universe, and put them into a dot, this dot would be in the ninth dimension.</p>
<p>10: Now, in the ninth dimension, we spoke about having all possibilities of an infinity into one dot, right?  Now, it is possible to have multiple infinities, by changing what happened before another infinity started.  Now, if you put every possibility, from every infinity, from all of the universe, into one dot, you would put this dot in the 10th dimension.</p>
<p>11: Recent breakthroughs in how atoms are made and what happens in our universe adds up to a final dimension, an extra one.  When you imagine our universe, you think “Well thats it, we’re the only universe, the universe is everything!”, quite contrary.  The 11th dimension holds different universes, they are called membranes.  It is like a thin wavy disk that floats around in the 11th dimension.  Our universe is one of those disks, but there are other disks floating around, holding other universes, where the laws of physics that apply here, may not apply there, it could be entirely different.</p>
<p>==================</p>
<p>Now, back to the main topic.  How does the big bang happen?  Well, scientists used to say super nova, but thats not true.  If you imagine those membranes flying around in the 11th dimension, what do you think if one of them hit eachother would happen?  Say hello to the big bang.  When one of those membranes collide, it causes the big bang, and this process has probably been going on since the beginning of time, which is, well, forever.  When you put it this way, there has been other beings on our planets in this galaxy, doing the same stuff, and they think their great too, they die, they think their going to heaven but their just, well, dead.  Then something else fucks up their planet, or maybe, just maybe, the plates collided, their life ended, and started ours.</p>
<p>We came from tiny bacteria thriving to make us.  We’re insignificant beings on a planet, we think somebody cares about us but they don’t, we just live, and die, and then we get blown up, whats the point?</p>
<p>That brings me to another topic:  Death.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Death</span></p>
<p>Death.  Everyone doesn’t want it to happen, but when it does, you go to heaven, and you live forever, righto? (Depending on your religion)  Put it this way, ever lay in bed, fall asleep, almost suddenly you seem to be awake, then all of the sudden, your sitting there and its morning.  8 hours passed like nothing, how you say?  Your brain shuts down, it doesn’t read time anymore, its just not active, and when its all rejuvinated, you wake up.  If you can pass 8 hours in what seems to be 1 second, why can’t you pass an eternity?</p>
<p>When you die, brain activity ceases to happen, meaning your brain doesn’t know what time it is, where you are, what your doing, it doesn’t even know your alive, your just not there anymore.  Imagine yourself sleeping, you don’t know your sleeping, you can’t feel yourself rolling over, your just, well, dead.</p>
<p>Dead is like that, only you never wake up.  I believe in god, I’m definately not anti-him, a person needs someone to ask something in times of hardship, and if heaven does exist, thats great.  But I like to believe logic just as much.</p>
<p>-==============</p>
<p>When we look at our keyboards, our monitors, you might wonder how its created, how its something, infront of me, if its just a bunch of balls, or atoms, stuck together.  Well, to understand this you must know what atoms are made of.  Atoms are the building blocks, right?  They can’t be made of anything.  Well, if their balls of a definate size, they have to be made of something.  They are made of ‘strings’.  Strings are indefinate sized squiggly always moving lines, all attatched together to make an atom.  They make up everything, from the air we breathe, to the keyboard we type on.</p>
<p>They are all just stuck together in half circles.  The air we breathe is made up of full circle strings.  They control everything, gravity for example.  A graviton is a string which is in the air all around us, pushing us down.  Scientists are trying to harvest a graviton, for with a graviton, for example, if you put one modified graviton inside an upside down bucket, the bucket would shoot towards the sky, as if falling up.</p>
<p>==============</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Aliens</span></p>
<p>Sure, some of us believe them, some of us don’t.  But its a fact they are real, but we are not 100% sure they have been visiting our planet.  When we set off an atomic bomb, it sent a quake through the universe.  Some intelligent planet probably was searching for novas, when they felt that, and went to check it out, and found us.  Thats when the first siting happened.</p>
<p>The government knows we have aliens, and they have almost flat out told us they are having coffee with the government.  They have started a plan starting in 1994 to slowly let us know by giving clues to the public that they are lieing, and that we got aliens.</p>
<p>The first act of this was when they told us the ‘weather balloon’ was infact, an enemy spy plane.  Which is like them telling us they have been lieing to us for 50 years, but thats still bullshit, everyone knows that it was an alien.  They are slowly telling us info, and letting out classified information.  When they tell us that we got aliens and show one, it will be pretty funny.</p>
<p>====================</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Meteors &amp; Extinction</span></p>
<p>The meteor that killed the dinosaurs.  It wasn’t small, it was 10 miles long and 2 miles wide.  It hit the earth at astonishing speeds.  It threw debreigh up into the atmosphere that could be seen from the exact opposite point of the world.  Hot ash and quakes made the apocalipse real, volcanoes erupted, hurricanes rocked the world, and earthquakes killed.  The sky was pitch black for years, and every dinosaur died.</p>
<p>That was 69 million years ago.  I speak of the big bang happening, but thats on a scale far out of our reach, what do I mean?  14 billion years ago the big bang happened, primitive life tried to thrive, but died, constantly, with the meteors hitting earth.  We believe the dinosaurs were the first life to thrive.  14 billion years and 69 million years ago was the first thriving life, what the hell?  Anyways, that shows that the earth is new, and we, or our grandsons, or their grandsons, or theirs, and so on until the point of infinity may never experience the ending of the universe - but maybe the ending of human life.</p>
<h1>Scientists predict that every 100 million years, a meteor the magnitude of the one that killed the dinosaurs, will hit the earth, and wipe out life.  Scary thought?  Its not far fetched either, we have 40 million years to live, and maybe, if we survive that long (not making earth inhabitable with our pollution), our race will see what the dinosaurs saw, and life will begin again, it may never become intelligent, maybe not even ever thrive, maybe it will completely make earth a rock of nothingness.  Then comes the big bang and destroys ALL of the universe.  We start over from scratch.  Makes us feel like even more nothing doesn’t it, we are nothing.</h1>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Gravity</span></p>
<p>According to my previous fact that gravitons are what gravity is, those are in this dimension, but they are around us, an invisible force that might be able to control gravity, but why is there gravity, and easy way to think of it is, you know how people say “Ripping the fabric of the universe” (tell that to the black hole, which I’ll get to in a minute), well its not all sci-fi.  When a huge ball of rock is floating in space, its not moving up, or down, only maybe left and right with extreme force, think of it like this, their is a blanket, stretched tight, and you put a rock in the middle (our sun), it would bend the blanket down, creating gravity, and if you put a whole bunch of other rocks around it, (this might not be the most accurate recreation because the rocks would all collide into the ‘sun’, space works differently but anyways), the rocks would be the planets and they would create their own ‘gravity’ around a bigger gravitational pull, the ‘sun’, in real life, these ‘planets’ might just roll into the ‘sun’, but in space, this is different because gravitons are holding it in place.  Why do the planets rotate around the sun?  Well, think of when you throw a basketball in a hoop, and it circles around it a few times, then goes into it, think of the hoop as a gravitational mass, and the basketball as a asteroid, it gets spun around it a few times then flies into the mass.  Space is the same, only the planets are big enough, and far enough away, that ‘the basketball is too big to go into the hoop’, and its only place to go is out, where the pull is a little less daunting, and they will move away faster and faster and maybe eventually collide into something that might be thousands of lightyears away.</p>
<h1>I say this because scientists know that the planets are moving away from their gravitational ‘daddy’ slowly, inches a year, but its happening.  We’re like the sun to the moon and the moon is a planet, the moon can’t collide into us, but it is moving slowly away.</h1>

<p>I want some hard on proof that this is all true. I don’t believe anything I read, especially on the internet, without some hard on proof. How do people know what happens to the brain when there dead? Because when your dead you can’t wake back up to tell anyone about it.</p>

<p>Your brain slowly gets eaten by insects when you are dead. You just don’t feel anything anymore. Its just like before you were born, you didn’t exist.</p>

Dr Freud had a theory about that.</p>
<p>Things that stay in your subconcious, are often “released” by the brain while you sleep, resulting in visual images, distorted memorys of feelings, things that you can’t realy remember but your subconcious noticed etc.</p>

        <p>Now, evangelion, that is an anime yes, but I don’t like it because of the graphics, it has the most spetacular story line. I know I get a little addictited to things, evangelion especially, but it gets very psychological, makes you question life. Not recomended to start watching at 6pm and finishing 4 am(with breaks of couse…).</p>
<p>As for aliens, now that gets intresting, you either see aliens and try to tell people and get locked up in the loony bin and the infected goverment did this, or they really are loony.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, “I know I get a little addictited to things,” and this makes me sound like a real no-lifer, but I’ve had my(and still do) little fantasys of impossible things happening, dose this mean I’m mad? This also makes me sound like a real no-lifer, but I talk to myself in my brain, if that makes sence, so am I mad or a normal human being? What do I compair my sanity myself to? How to I tell if I’m even sane? We’re all unique, our world just could be a meer illusion of a dead person, of what you want it to be, who knows, tomorrow you could wake up, know everybody in both worlds like the trick they do with the camera’s and be a totally diffrent person. I doubt we’ll get any concrete evidence on what life was made from and why it is to be any time soon.</p>
<p>About dreaming, now that gets very scarey, I have almost certon proof what happens to your body is delayed, like your brain can tell what will happen and pave your dream for you, I remember one night(this is in my dream), I was in my room, it was dark, I was sat down, fealing scared at my door looking at the rest of my room, looking at my bed, I saw somthing, I beleve I saw an alien(alien’s such a looney word, I don’t know or want to know what it was but it was somthing we all fear, another life we know nothing about, or atleast that’s what I fear :p), my room flashed, I felt so scared I couldn’t move, as it got closer, closer then my mind goes blank. I remember some dreams, and I know what caused the flash, my head rolled off my pillow and fell on the side of my bead, so I banged my head(it’s not complicated but I’ll say it’s complicated so I don’t need to tell you all about it. :p), so it’s either my mind knew I was going to bang and decided to plot against my brain’s partner, it already happend but there was a delay so my mind knew what to think or somthing like that, or it just happend there was a flash and “somthing” gets closer to me as I sit there scared like shit not being able to do anything about it, or I’m just mad.  ;D</p>
<p>What really is scarey though, that you can feal emotions in your dreams, as I really was scared and spooked all day, and still am about it. That brings me to my third paragraph in this post, I can go on for ever typing this up slightly diffrent each time, it’s a very bad habbit of mine, but am I just mad or are there really other things depurifiying our minds? Either way, I’m never lonely <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Edited a few things that didn’t sound right, and about my dream, I know I hit my head, I had a red mark on my head, now was that really an alien visit or just a dream? The mind boggles…</p>

        <p>[quote=“yaz, post:12, topic:7916”]what if you get shot in the head,?cant dream then</p>
<p>also bego can you explaine dreams?? i know when you sleep(in your deepest point of sleep) your brain is processing what happend that day and put it in your long term memory , does that hyave anything to do with what you dream??[/quote]</p>
<p>Dreaming is done in the moments before you wake up, in non-REM sleep, you move around, your technically not sleeping, your dreaming, it doesn’t rejuvinate your body in that period, it makes it remember thoughts and replay them.</p>
<p>[quote=“The Un-Named, post:16, topic:7916”]Now, evangelion, that is an anime yes, but I don’t like it because of the graphics, it has the most spetacular story line.

<p>Dreams are an easy answer to extratarrestrials, and thats what most people think it is, but I believe its real, but they may have to power to make you believe it was a dream.  Think about that.  Also, when your asleep, its easy to feel feelings, I once woke up with scratches all over my arms because I was scratching myself, to feel pain during a nightmare.  You have control over your body - your just must master it.[br][size=1]Posted at: August 06, 2006, 05:32:03 PM[/size][hr]To put some real into Mr.Chris, thats possible, that could describe heaven, your brain remains somewhat active, undetectable, and it creates a real world for you to control, for people who think like I do, if that happened, I would be crazy in that world, because for one, I know that thats a dream, and my children would be talking to me, and it would be like god tricking me, false security, I would be crying, I was cheated from life…  I’d rather not exist than live somewhere where I was in the ground when I’m thinking I’m in a reality, its a very scary thing, and I hardly thought of it that way.</p>
<p>Makes me jittery just thinking about it, puts much less meaning in life.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Okay, now I’m fucking scared.  What if your parents are a false reality right now?  Your wife, your girlfriend, your friends, WHAT IF YOUR IN THE GROUND AT THIS MOMENT IN ANOTHER LIFE?  That puts real into rebirth, and in that case, you have been fucked out of life plenty of times, and you will forget whats happened before, right now this could be all in my mind, I could be typing this out on a keyboard that doesn’t exist, maybe their isn’t a real life, technically their isn’t, we don’t have a life.  We are victims of a very large system of dimensions.</p>
<p>Making me fucking scared man, thinking about it just makes me get lost in my mind.</p>

        <p>What I find creepy is how everyone describes aliens the exact same way. Big black eyes, small pointy chin, no ears, tiny nose. Basically like their head is shaped like a heart, but without the divot on the top.</p>

        <p>To be honest, I think the ‘universe outside of universe’ stuff is stupid, and illogical. My reasons for saying that is then the question that is posed is “What’s in the universes universe”, etc. Much Like St. Thomas Aquinases (SP :$!) theory on God (The cause that caused all causes).</p>
<p>And no, there are not other ‘living’ life forms in our universe. No chance. They do not live like us. It’s impossible.       (Note that’s just my conclusion, but it’s extremely valid IMO).</p>
<p>I do believe that there were other universes though, as it’s just logic.</p>
<p>However, I also believe that we are one of the most capable and intelligent lifeforms ever.</p>
<p>We know what the universe is made of, what’s in it, AND…</p>
<p>We can live life without appreciating the fact. All of us live it and have worries that we think are ‘natural’ (like debt), but our human caused, because in what? &lt;20,000 years we’ve managed to build a system like that.</p>
<p>We’re incrediable.</p>
