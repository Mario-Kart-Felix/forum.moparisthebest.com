<p>EDIT:  Okay, now I’m fucking scared.  What if your parents are a false reality right now?  Your wife, your girlfriend, your friends, WHAT IF YOUR IN THE GROUND AT THIS MOMENT IN ANOTHER LIFE?  That puts real into rebirth, and in that case, you have been fucked out of life plenty of times, and you will forget whats happened before, right now this could be all in my mind, I could be typing this out on a keyboard that doesn’t exist, maybe their isn’t a real life, technically their isn’t, we don’t have a life.  We are victims of a very large system of dimensions.</p>

        <p>I think this is just a game in a game, in another game, which would be in another game… in another game, and another… and another game, virtual reality game, in another game, different forms, in another game, in a game. Or this could just be one single virtual reality game, just like runescape…  :eek:</p>

        <p>Or, since i just got onto thinking about dreams…wut if our lives were all just never ending dreams?</p>
<p>First, think about a dream. You see it all, and it seems real. It IS real to you. When you wake up, the dream ends and real life begins. But what happens when real life ends? Does another dream full of dreams begin? (aka, life. A life of dreams).</p>

        <p>[quote=“David, post:20, topic:7916”]To be honest, I think the ‘universe outside of universe’ stuff is stupid, and illogical. My reasons for saying that is then the question that is posed is “What’s in the universes universe”, etc. Much Like St. Thomas Aquinases (SP :$!) theory on God (The cause that caused all causes).</p>
<p>And no, there are not other ‘living’ life forms in our universe. No chance. They do not live like us. It’s impossible.       (Note that’s just my conclusion, but it’s extremely valid IMO).</p>
<p>I do believe that there were other universes though, as it’s just logic.</p>
<p>However, I also believe that we are one of the most capable and intelligent lifeforms ever.</p>
<p>We know what the universe is made of, what’s in it, AND…</p>
<p>We can live life without appreciating the fact. All of us live it and have worries that we think are ‘natural’ (like debt), but our human caused, because in what? &lt;20,000 years we’ve managed to build a system like that.</p>
<p>We’re incrediable.[/quote]</p>
<p>Their must be other life forms, outside of our galaxy, its ignorant to think that we’re the only people with a mind capable of, what?  Making electricity.  Its not that big of a feat, and yet it powers almost everything we do, creatures in a different galaxy can most likely do what we can do and more.</p>
<p>[quote=“MrWicked, post:21, topic:7916”]I dont know about your logic, I mean a beleif is a beleif and well yea thats the point. But I do have theorys of my own, Who dosent? Life would be boring without them. Now Religion I am un-sure about and I always will. I have no reason to take the word of a stranger I do not know and beleive what he says is the truth. Death I beleive there is more to death then simply rotting. It is a fact that your body weighs 6 ounces less after you die, Not 6 ounces less after you have been sitting and decomposing. But the instant you die you weigh 6 ounces less. Im not claiming that this is your sole rising to the above but, it does give reason to beleive in something more.

<p>Your body weighs 6 ounces less because immediately following the point of death, all fluids, solids, all waste, exits your body, meaning shit, and piss, and your blood pools in certain parts of your body and 6 hours after dieing decomposion starts.</p>

<p>Shut the fuck up and go drink the stuff under the sink.</p>

<p>Possible, but illogical, because we would have to wake up eventually, and dieing usually doesn’t mean waking up, theres too much to life than living in a dream.  Dieing would bring you to another life, realizing that you were dreaming for a super long time really sounds illogical.</p>

To be honest, I think the ‘universe outside of universe’ stuff is stupid, and illogical. My reasons for saying that is then the question that is posed is “What’s in the universes universe”, etc. Much Like St. Thomas Aquinases (SP :$!) theory on God (The cause that caused all causes).</p>
<p>And no, there are not other ‘living’ life forms in our universe. No chance. They do not live like us. It’s impossible.       (Note that’s just my conclusion, but it’s extremely valid IMO).</p>
<p>I do believe that there were other universes though, as it’s just logic.</p>
<p>However, I also believe that we are one of the most capable and intelligent lifeforms ever.</p>
<p>We know what the universe is made of, what’s in it, AND…</p>
<p>We can live life without appreciating the fact. All of us live it and have worries that we think are ‘natural’ (like debt), but our human caused, because in what? &lt;20,000 years we’ve managed to build a system like that.</p>
<p>We’re incrediable.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Their must be other life forms, outside of our galaxy, its ignorant to think that we’re the only people with a mind capable of, what?  Making electricity.  Its not that big of a feat, and yet it powers almost everything we do, creatures in a different galaxy can most likely do what we can do and more.</p>

<p>I dont know about your logic, I mean a beleif is a beleif and well yea thats the point. But I do have theorys of my own, Who dosent? Life would be boring without them. Now Religion I am un-sure about and I always will. I have no reason to take the word of a stranger I do not know and beleive what he says is the truth. Death I beleive there is more to death then simply rotting. It is a fact that your body weighs 6 ounces less after you die, Not 6 ounces less after you have been sitting and decomposing. But the instant you die you weigh 6 ounces less. Im not claiming that this is your sole rising to the above but, it does give reason to beleive in something more. Your entity traveling to another point in time where you can be reborn or recreated in another form, here or on another planet.  Who knows…</p>
<p>Simply dieing and that is gives no reasoning to ghosts. Which is another topic I wont even get started on.</p>
<p>The alien theory you give is closely related to my thoughts. I do beleive there are aliens there is no reason to disagree with this. Roswell is a prime example of alien evidence, and no I do not beleive it was a weather balloon or any other coverup bullshit the goverments been trying place in our heads. We cannot be the only life forms on this planet. It is not impossible for this, you see fish that live thousands of feet under water where the pressure would cause death to any human that attempted.</p>
<p>It is not impossible for bateria to evolve into a greater form after millions of years.<br>
Aliens are much more intelligent then we are. Giving all the sightings and evidence provided it proves they are more intelligent then we are.<br>
Aliens have crash landed on earth. Wether they crashed or not they still managed to make it this far. Which is unbeleiveable further then we could get.<br>
Although im sure there are plenty of things that we do not know that has been coverd up by the goverment for centuries. And I wish they would just stop the bullshit and lay it out in front of us…</p>

<p>Your body weighs 6 ounces less because immediately following the point of death, all fluids, solids, all waste, exits your body, meaning shit, and piss, and your blood pools in certain parts of your body and 6 hours after dieing decomposion starts.</p>

That puts real into rebirth, and in that case, you have been fucked out of life plenty of times, and you will forget whats happened before, right now this could be all in my mind, I could be typing this out on a keyboard that doesn’t exist, maybe their isn’t a real life, technically their isn’t, we don’t have a life.  We are victims of a very large system of dimensions.</p>

<p>Or, since i just got onto thinking about dreams…wut if our lives were all just never ending dreams?</p>
<p>First, think about a dream. You see it all, and it seems real. It IS real to you. When you wake up, the dream ends and real life begins. But what happens when real life ends? Does another dream full of dreams begin? (aka, life. A life of dreams).</p>

<p>Possible, but illogical, because we would have to wake up eventually, and dieing usually doesn’t mean waking up, theres too much to life than living in a dream.  Dieing would bring you to another life, realizing that you were dreaming for a super long time really sounds illogical.[/quote]<br>
No 6 Ounces of unknown weight, Not from bodily fluids or excriment.<br>
6 ounces of weight that is unaccountable.</p>
<p>Plus if shit and piss was going to exit from your body it would be alot more then 6 ounces.</p>

<p>Well, it all started out with the big bang, right?  Thats partly true, it didn’t first ‘start’ with the big bang, the big bang was actually going on for plenty of eternities.  What?
