    <title>How The Universe Came To What It Is and How Its Made</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-the-universe-came-to-what-it-is-and-how-its-made/7916</link>
    <description>[b]This is all written by Bego, off the top of his head, I study up on this kind of stuff very much[/b]

How the universe is how it is today!

Well, it all started out with the big bang, right?  Thats partly true, it didn&#39;t first &#39;start&#39; with the big bang, the big bang was actually going on for plenty of eternities.  What?  How is that possible?  Well to understand this, you would have to know something about the 11 dimensions.

=================

[b]Dimensions[/b]

0: There is nothing, there is a point of indefinate size, its just an idea.

1: If theres a line, with no width, and no depth, only height, this is the 1st dimension.

2: The 2nd dimension is, well, think about when people say 2D, its the same thing, height, width, but no depth.

3: This is easiest for us because this is what we live in, a 3 dimensional object has width, height, and depth.

4: What we can describe the 4th dimension as is duration.  If you imagined yourself from the time you were 1 minute ago, to the way you are now, the line you could draw between those points in time would be a line in the fourth dimension.

5: If you imagined bending the line of time in the fourth dimension, to meet another point in time, you would do this in the 5th dimension.  In theory, time travel is possible then, and I believe we&#39;re not far from time travel in the future.

6: The 6th dimension holds all possibilities for your life.  If you did something in your childhood that made you famous and rich by now, you would want to see what would happen if you hadn&#39;t, you would do this in the 6th dimension.

7: You can bend the 7th dimension to meet the 6th dimension imitating time travel in a different sense.

8: Forgot..

9: Ah, now I remember, this holds all future possibilities for an infinity.  Subotomic particles vibrating in the tenth dimension make up our vision, what we see.  We cannot view the dimensions above us, so we don&#39;t know whats happening behind the scenes.  If you have looked at all possibilities for an infinity, every single possibility to ever happen in the universe, and put them into a dot, this dot would be in the ninth dimension.

10: Now, in the ninth dimension, we spoke about having all possibilities of an infinity into one dot, right?  Now, it is possible to have multiple infinities, by changing what happened before another infinity started.  Now, if you put every possibility, from every infinity, from all of the universe, into one dot, you would put this dot in the 10th dimension.

11: Recent breakthroughs in how atoms are made and what happens in our universe adds up to a final dimension, an extra one.  When you imagine our universe, you think &quot;Well thats it, we&#39;re the only universe, the universe is everything!&quot;, quite contrary.  The 11th dimension holds different universes, they are called membranes.  It is like a thin wavy disk that floats around in the 11th dimension.  Our universe is one of those disks, but there are other disks floating around, holding other universes, where the laws of physics that apply here, may not apply there, it could be entirely different.

==================


Now, back to the main topic.  How does the big bang happen?  Well, scientists used to say super nova, but thats not true.  If you imagine those membranes flying around in the 11th dimension, what do you think if one of them hit eachother would happen?  Say hello to the big bang.  When one of those membranes collide, it causes the big bang, and this process has probably been going on since the beginning of time, which is, well, forever.  When you put it this way, there has been other beings on our planets in this galaxy, doing the same stuff, and they think their great too, they die, they think their going to heaven but their just, well, dead.  Then something else fucks up their planet, or maybe, just maybe, the plates collided, their life ended, and started ours.

We came from tiny bacteria thriving to make us.  We&#39;re insignificant beings on a planet, we think somebody cares about us but they don&#39;t, we just live, and die, and then we get blown up, whats the point?

That brings me to another topic:  Death.


[b]Death[/b]

Death.  Everyone doesn&#39;t want it to happen, but when it does, you go to heaven, and you live forever, righto? (Depending on your religion)  Put it this way, ever lay in bed, fall asleep, almost suddenly you seem to be awake, then all of the sudden, your sitting there and its morning.  8 hours passed like nothing, how you say?  Your brain shuts down, it doesn&#39;t read time anymore, its just not active, and when its all rejuvinated, you wake up.  If you can pass 8 hours in what seems to be 1 second, why can&#39;t you pass an eternity?

When you die, brain activity ceases to happen, meaning your brain doesn&#39;t know what time it is, where you are, what your doing, it doesn&#39;t even know your alive, your just not there anymore.  Imagine yourself sleeping, you don&#39;t know your sleeping, you can&#39;t feel yourself rolling over, your just, well, dead.

Dead is like that, only you never wake up.  I believe in god, I&#39;m definately not anti-him, a person needs someone to ask something in times of hardship, and if heaven does exist, thats great.  But I like to believe logic just as much.

-==============

When we look at our keyboards, our monitors, you might wonder how its created, how its something, infront of me, if its just a bunch of balls, or atoms, stuck together.  Well, to understand this you must know what atoms are made of.  Atoms are the building blocks, right?  They can&#39;t be made of anything.  Well, if their balls of a definate size, they have to be made of something.  They are made of &#39;strings&#39;.  Strings are indefinate sized squiggly always moving lines, all attatched together to make an atom.  They make up everything, from the air we breathe, to the keyboard we type on.

They are all just stuck together in half circles.  The air we breathe is made up of full circle strings.  They control everything, gravity for example.  A graviton is a string which is in the air all around us, pushing us down.  Scientists are trying to harvest a graviton, for with a graviton, for example, if you put one modified graviton inside an upside down bucket, the bucket would shoot towards the sky, as if falling up.

==============

[b]Aliens[/b]

Sure, some of us believe them, some of us don&#39;t.  But its a fact they are real, but we are not 100% sure they have been visiting our planet.  When we set off an atomic bomb, it sent a quake through the universe.  Some intelligent planet probably was searching for novas, when they felt that, and went to check it out, and found us.  Thats when the first siting happened.

The government knows we have aliens, and they have almost flat out told us they are having coffee with the government.  They have started a plan starting in 1994 to slowly let us know by giving clues to the public that they are lieing, and that we got aliens.

The first act of this was when they told us the &#39;weather balloon&#39; was infact, an enemy spy plane.  Which is like them telling us they have been lieing to us for 50 years, but thats still bullshit, everyone knows that it was an alien.  They are slowly telling us info, and letting out classified information.  When they tell us that we got aliens and show one, it will be pretty funny.

====================

[b]Meteors &amp; Extinction[/b]

The meteor that killed the dinosaurs.  It wasn&#39;t small, it was 10 miles long and 2 miles wide.  It hit the earth at astonishing speeds.  It threw debreigh up into the atmosphere that could be seen from the exact opposite point of the world.  Hot ash and quakes made the apocalipse real, volcanoes erupted, hurricanes rocked the world, and earthquakes killed.  The sky was pitch black for years, and every dinosaur died.

That was 69 million years ago.  I speak of the big bang happening, but thats on a scale far out of our reach, what do I mean?  14 billion years ago the big bang happened, primitive life tried to thrive, but died, constantly, with the meteors hitting earth.  We believe the dinosaurs were the first life to thrive.  14 billion years and 69 million years ago was the first thriving life, what the hell?  Anyways, that shows that the earth is new, and we, or our grandsons, or their grandsons, or theirs, and so on until the point of infinity may never experience the ending of the universe - but maybe the ending of human life.

Scientists predict that every 100 million years, a meteor the magnitude of the one that killed the dinosaurs, will hit the earth, and wipe out life.  Scary thought?  Its not far fetched either, we have 40 million years to live, and maybe, if we survive that long (not making earth inhabitable with our pollution), our race will see what the dinosaurs saw, and life will begin again, it may never become intelligent, maybe not even ever thrive, maybe it will completely make earth a rock of nothingness.  Then comes the big bang and destroys ALL of the universe.  We start over from scratch.  Makes us feel like even more nothing doesn&#39;t it, we are nothing.
===========================

[b]Gravity[/b]

According to my previous fact that gravitons are what gravity is, those are in this dimension, but they are around us, an invisible force that might be able to control gravity, but why is there gravity, and easy way to think of it is, you know how people say &quot;Ripping the fabric of the universe&quot; (tell that to the black hole, which I&#39;ll get to in a minute), well its not all sci-fi.  When a huge ball of rock is floating in space, its not moving up, or down, only maybe left and right with extreme force, think of it like this, their is a blanket, stretched tight, and you put a rock in the middle (our sun), it would bend the blanket down, creating gravity, and if you put a whole bunch of other rocks around it, (this might not be the most accurate recreation because the rocks would all collide into the &#39;sun&#39;, space works differently but anyways), the rocks would be the planets and they would create their own &#39;gravity&#39; around a bigger gravitational pull, the &#39;sun&#39;, in real life, these &#39;planets&#39; might just roll into the &#39;sun&#39;, but in space, this is different because gravitons are holding it in place.  Why do the planets rotate around the sun?  Well, think of when you throw a basketball in a hoop, and it circles around it a few times, then goes into it, think of the hoop as a gravitational mass, and the basketball as a asteroid, it gets spun around it a few times then flies into the mass.  Space is the same, only the planets are big enough, and far enough away, that &#39;the basketball is too big to go into the hoop&#39;, and its only place to go is out, where the pull is a little less daunting, and they will move away faster and faster and maybe eventually collide into something that might be thousands of lightyears away.

I say this because scientists know that the planets are moving away from their gravitational &#39;daddy&#39; slowly, inches a year, but its happening.  We&#39;re like the sun to the moon and the moon is a planet, the moon can&#39;t collide into us, but it is moving slowly away.

<p>also the universe didn’t come out of nothing thus the theory tells: matter can not be created nor destroyed, so be happy we didn’t come out of nothing we came out of something.[/quote]</p>
<p>Ahh, but that statement is incorrect.  A proper version is that energy cannot be created or destroyed.  Matter is simply a manifestation of energy (this is where the equation E = mc^2 comes into play).  When people say we came from nothing with reference to the big bang, they mean that the universe emerged from an infinitesimally tiny singularity with a huge energy density.</p>
<p>But I thought Einstein only discussed time travel to the past with regard to wormholes and traveling faster than the speed of light.  If this were possible, it is somewhat equivalent to traveling back in time but that’s only because the universe does not run on “absolute time,” as was thought prior to the introduction of relativity.</p>

              <p>Nice topic Bego…I never saw this before.</p>
<p>I do have a couple of questions though…first is your declaration of 11 dimensions.  I was under the impression that modern physics only accounts for four dimensions…the three spacial dimensions and time.  Superstring theory introduced the concept of 3 spacial dimensions, 1 time dimension, and 6 dimensions that are curled up in sub-Planck’s length regions (extensions of string theory, obviously, can add additional dimensions to make 11, 17, or 26 dimensions).  Except for additional time dimensions which apparently curl in ways that I have no clue about, the additional spacial dimensions are supposed make up Calabi–Yao (sp?) manifests that would go unnoticed in the large scale of everyday life.</p>
<p>So I’m just curious about your description about the 11 dimensions…what theory suggests them like that?</p>
<p>Also, regarding the 11th dimension, I understand what you’re saying.  It has, of course, been suggested that our “universe” is something like a soap bubble that continually expands along with countless other “universes” in yet another level of the cosmos yet undetected.  But would that really be considered another dimension?  Or simply another scale of the universe?</p>
<p>Anyway, its great having others who share my interest in such abstract, amazing and awe-inspiring concepts.  Its this kind of stuff that really allows you put into perspective all of the subtleties of the world that typically go unnoticed as well as the vastness of the universe we live in that shows how insignificant we really are.</p>

no not the big bang, the story in the bible about how god made the earth. on this day he made the animals, this day water, this day human, and on the 7th day he was done and rested. something like that. hard to believe that he made all of this in a week. im leaning more towards the big bang and evolution theory. and still the question, how did god come into existence???<br>

<p>Which is why I believe science, it doesn’t make you believe vague concepts and presumptuous things, we are the only race that has religion, all other animals are just around killing each other, we think we’ll go to hell if we kill someone, or kick their ass, when in fact its what we are - we’re animals, men have wider shoulders and more strength so they can fight and kill for their women.  Women have breasts and curves, same way a peacock has fancy feathers, the more fancy the more the opposite sex will be attracted.</p>
<p>We’re animals and we think we’re above that and it sickens me.  I’m sure the millions of mosquitoes that die every day have gone to heaven and lived happily ever after with their religions.  No, they eat blood so they can feed their eggs and reproduce.  All we have is a mind that allows us to make all these theories that I think, if we step back and take a look, we should realize that we’re just animals with stupid beliefs that don’t justify anything.[/quote]</p>

<p>I’m surprised nobody mentioned reincarnation.It’s the most logical explanation imo.<br>
Some people are born in rich family’s and some in poor.Why did someone get in the rich family and someone in the poor?Because he was lucky?<br>
NO.<br>
Because he did great things in his previous life and wich therefore he got rewarded and was born in a rich family.<br>
After you are born, you determine your own future.If you do good things , a good future is ahead of you and if you do bad things you will experience bad things.</p>
<p>Just think about that , its the most logical explanation ever!</p>

<p>no not the big bang, the story in the bible about how god made the earth. on this day he made the animals, this day water, this day human, and on the 7th day he was done and rested. something like that. hard to believe that he made all of this in a week. im leaning more towards the big bang and evolution theory. and still the question, how did god come into existence???</p>

</aside>
<p>If he’s god, it wouldn’t be a problem. Also where did the big bang came from?</p>
<p>2 soul raever: It’s says it was night and the next day or something like that, so real days. Not seconds and not billion of years.</p>

<p>pko made the universe, end of story.[/quote]But I wanted to make the universe… I hate you, goto hell. I hope as soon as I die everyone else I like finds shelter and you’re the only one that doesn’t and another big bang happens but somehow everyone else survives. Of course, you do too. But you suffer for 14 billion more years and goto hell, where you then suffer for eternity &gt;=(</p>
<p>Just kidding <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Also Bego, I loved it. It was awesome, I found some spelling errors (I might become and english teacher when I grow up though I hate teaching and I truely don’t wanna) but overall, it’s a 10/10.</p>
