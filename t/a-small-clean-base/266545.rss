    <title>A small, clean base?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-small-clean-base/266545</link>
    <description>Hey, I&#39;m sorry that my first post is an inquiry/request but I&#39;d like to get started and I wasn&#39;t sure where to post.

I used the search feature, but I would like some recommendations.

 :o
-

I&#39;m not looking for a link to a flashy server with features and custom shit.

I just would like a base to get started on.

Best way to get the hang of this is to do the most I can myself.

Same goes for client, just a blank basic client to use.

[b]Note:[/b] I searched through the forums and looked at many of the sources and clients posted for public use, yet they&#39;re riddled with features I&#39;d just end up removing anyway.

[b]Q:[/b] [i]&quot;why not just make your own from scratch noob?&quot;[/i]
[b]A:[/b] I&#39;d love to lol, that&#39;s what I plan to do anyway. The more work I put into it&#39;s creation, the more I&#39;ll understand towards fixing it and improving upon it. There are some things that make that process easier though, like a simple basic layout.

Once again, I&#39;m incredibly sorry if this is yet another irritating post for those of you here who know your shit already. I&#39;m simply looking forward to getting the hang of it and contributing what I can to the community. I have no desire to leech and leave.

Thank you!

              <p>For the Source i Recommend All-Star Scape v2 Even though a lot of people hate it but, it really is good just make sure you don’t extract the tools folder… that has a Trojan in it but if you do you can just delete the tools folder. Its an old Trojan were Mod All-Star would come and hack your server and steal it but just delete tools folder (the virus is Shop Maker).</p>
<p>For the Client i recommend Kihomura’s 317 Client it is very very basic no custom and no viruses…</p>
<p>To get them just use search NOTE: Deltascape is not good source!!!</p>

After reading that post, a few things come to mind what I would like to do this ‘twat’. Few I could say here. Anyway, perhaps downloading JRE? <a href="http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp" rel="nofollow noopener">http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp</a></p>

<p>Thanks for the help, I’ve checked out the sources you’ve suggested. I’m very interested in Yz’s base, although I’m having some trouble with Vista. So I’ll work on that later.</p>
<p>Also, regarding a client. I saw the huge list of features involved with DeltaScape’s source (I also read the posts by people struggling to get it to work, I think that anti-leech is genious! :D)</p>
<p>I’m sure with a server as ‘filled’ as that would require a great client, which I don’t have.</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestions for a client and source that either go together, or are mutually clean? So any features I add I’ll make sure work with the client?</p>
<p>P.S. The organization with Rs2dv seems amazing, so I’m eager to try and get that to work on Vista.</p>
<p>Also, check Windows Live messenger Chassy13. [My apologies for being off topic]</p>
<p>So far I’m most interested in Yz’s and Rs2dv based,  DeltaScape looks fantastic, but I would appreciate the features in it far more if I had made them work myself. This is a learning experience for me mostly.[/quote]<br>
