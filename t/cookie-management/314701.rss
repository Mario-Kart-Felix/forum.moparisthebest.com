    <title>Cookie Management</title>

    <description>I can&#39;t find any documentation on the process by which cookies are accepted and used.

This is what I am doing:

Client opens connection with server
Client specifies the stored cookies (if any) and basic headers
Client flushes
Server responds with Set-Cookie headers
Client interprets Set-Cookie headers and stores them in flat files
Client closes connection with server
Client opens connection with server
Client specifies the newly stored cookies (if any) and basic headers
Client flushes
Server responds with Set-Cookie headers and a body
Client prints out body
Client closes connection with server
etc..........

So the client has to effectively open a connection twice to receive and set the cookies. Is this right, or is there a way to somehow magically send some extra header data once the response has been received?</description>

<p>The client makes an HTTP request, the server sends cookies in an HTTP response, and all subsequent client HTTP requests will have those cookies, until the cookies expire.</p>
