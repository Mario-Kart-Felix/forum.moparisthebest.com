    <title>Jagex cust. service email?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jagex-cust-service-email/10148</link>
    <description>Hi,
I had my account locked as someone was on it swearing and got me an offence.
Well, i had my account locked but cant seem to find my old membership emails that had my credit details!
Does anyone know the email of Jagex customer support so i can tell them what happened?
Thanks
Justis
--EDIT--
No one knows?
Please someone help and no, this isnt the ban thing so its not breaking rules!</description>
