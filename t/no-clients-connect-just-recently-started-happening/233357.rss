    <title>NO clients connect, just recently started happening</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/no-clients-connect-just-recently-started-happening/233357</link>
    <description>If I run a client and try to connect to an online server, before even TRYING to log in, it just says error. This is only for any clients i downloaded to my desktop. MoparScape client works, and so does silabs WEBCLIENT. Does anyone know why this has happened? It just recently started doing this at random one day, and it has continued for a few weeks now. Before this I could connect with them. Any advice?</description>

              <p>Yes, I was able to use any client before this. I don’t think I have edited my classpaths, compilers still work.</p>

              <p>Before this happened were you able to use clients other than Mopar &amp; Silab. If you wasnt (or hadn’t tried) its because your computer doesnt recognise Java… If you were able to before hand, have you edited your classpath or path to correspond with a new Java dL?</p>
