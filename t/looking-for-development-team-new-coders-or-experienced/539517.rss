    <description>Hello, I am currently looking for New or Experienced coders for a RSPS, Im starting a 317 and already have a 753 Online RSPS.. my 753 is currently online with a VPS! So whichever you would prefer helping me code doesnt matter.
[b]I have medium experience[/b], and looking for a couple people to help me code, whether your new and want to learn as you go or experienced and want to build a RSPS Community.


 Some Features in 753: Drygores, Prestige System, All Minigames and bosses, ALL Skills working)
