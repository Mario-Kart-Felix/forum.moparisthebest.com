    <description>A remake of RuneScape right when Jagex released the PvP equipment.

[size=13pt][b]Training[/b][/size]
[b][size=11pt]Training areas and such will be equivalent as to RuneScape&#39;s, but the EXP rate will differ. Hopefully I can get it to about 90XP a hit without too many players complaining :P. If you&#39;re curious, these spots will exist for training: Rock Crabs (Both sides), Fire Giants, Dagganoths, Tzhaar Caves, I&#39;ll try to think of more areas.[/size][/b]

[b][size=13pt]Money-Making[/size][/b]
[b][size=11pt]Money making will be deeply tested for accuracy. I/we want the money-making to be easier than RuneScapes, but now too easy. So, the average of the BEST money making in the game will be around 5M and hour, extending that to about 7.5M if you are using a beast of burden. Some popular money making methods include: Monster/Boss killing, Mining and smithing, Runecrafting, fishing and cooking, and fletching. [/size][/b]

[b][size=13pt]Player-Killing and PvP[/size][/b]
[b][size=11pt]PKing and PvP will be coded to the best of my abilities. When the 525 cache came out in RuneScape, I believe there was no Bounty Hunter PvP (Modern BH). So, this will result in PvP drops. Statuettes will apply though, for some extra cash if you&#39;re getting unlucky with the drops. Statuettes are going to be able to be traded to Mandrith for cash. The amount of cash the player will be given is 2X that of RuneScape.[/size][/b]




[b][size=40pt]Delay in pictures, please be patient![/size][/b]</description>
