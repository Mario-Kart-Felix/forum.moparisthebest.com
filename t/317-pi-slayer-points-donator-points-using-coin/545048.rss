    <description>Hey, I need help with my slayer points and donator points, they are set to 3b so if it doesnt&#39; ask for the points, the players can&#39;t buy them.  But...how do I make them buy for donator points and slayer points? I couldn&#39;t post my post here, because of the max number imput or whatever, so here&#39;s the link to my post for it on rune-server, please help?
