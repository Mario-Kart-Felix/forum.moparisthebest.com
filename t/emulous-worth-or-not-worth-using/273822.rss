              <p>Newty, would you mind sending me that EMULOUS source with all skills, I would like to build off of that, adding Farming and adding some new minigames that I have came up with, or we could work together to make a good source, I don’t know if this is wrong place to ask, but if it is just let me know.</p>

              <p>Yes I agree, however, I have gone through my Emulous and fixed alot of shitty code, like useless loops, etc.</p>
<p>I also have programmed every skill into my Emulous, other then Farming of course :D. Each skill is also handled in it’s own file.</p>

Emulous has a lot of minuses then and very few pluses.<br>

<p>It is much more stable then a run of the mill Deltascape. I think you are saying that content wise it is far behind delta.[/quote]<br>
I know, it’s still better than Deltascape.<br>
It’s still not that much better, however, and the code is very messy and redundant.</p>
