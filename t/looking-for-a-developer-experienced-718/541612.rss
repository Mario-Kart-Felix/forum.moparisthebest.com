    <title>Looking for a Developer | Experienced | 718</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-developer-experienced-718/541612</link>
    <description>Alrighty, let&#39;s get right into it. My current lead developer is very busy with IRL stuff and his own server. He&#39;ll still be around, although I need some things done (I have another developer as well, but he&#39;s quite busy as well). I&#39;m a Founder of Centrodyn (AKA. Disturbed718), along side Zemv and Avex, and we&#39;ve been around since I think.. July? The server&#39;s currently down because of the production of V3. We have a very high quality home page and forums. The forums is a fully paid for IP.Board forums, which is heavily protected. We currently have a VPS for staff hosting, although we will be upgrading when we actually release the server. In the BETA server we had in July, we had 30+ players online at a time, and that was without sponsors. We are going to be buying sponsors as soon as the end the BETA of the V3, which will bring even more players along. Along side that, I will be making videos very often to attract even more players.

Mk, the nitty gritty. We&#39;re currently using a recently released source, CompanionScape. It&#39;s a 718/742 and was originated from a Matrix source. Although, the only reason I want to use this is because it has 25/25 skills fully working.

These are the things I want to know about you, you can leave them in a reply below:

What Experience do you have in Java Code?:
Do you have work to show what you&#39;ve done?:
Do you have a Skype? If so, you can PM it to me or give me it in a reply.: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That&#39;s all, if you&#39;re interested, apply below. PLEASE DO NOT apply if you aren&#39;t experienced...

Thanks,
~Tyler

EDIT: If Pay isn&#39;t aloud, simply remove that last paragraph.</description>
