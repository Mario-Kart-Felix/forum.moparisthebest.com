Noah&#39;s Ark, a popular story in Christianity is about the genocide of all species besides two animals of each species, one male and one female. The genocide is caused by God to &quot;rid the world of all of its current evils,&quot; yet the action is EXTREMELY evil. It&#39;s the death of nearly everything. The animals that survived, survive because Noah creates a boat and boards all of these animals. Not only is that a ludicrous idea, one man getting all the animals onto the ship but even then where is the food for the animals and also that&#39;d have to be a LARGE ship... What do you all think of this story?</description>

              <p>[quote=“heatrn11, post:4, topic:451164”]let’s see, if someone would like to criticizes another persons religion you should learn more about the religion first. Note there were probably only about 5,000 to 20,000 people on the Earth at this time, I’m only assuming, but that’s my guess. Also God gave the people of the Earth a chance…a chance to repent, they refused, so he found a holy man named Noha, saved him, his family and 2 of every animal on the Earth, sent a flood to the earth killed everyone, wiped out the Evil and the most beautiful parts of the earth. Then God promised he’d never send a great flood like that ever again. So after about 200 years the world became evil again.</p>
<p>in my opinion, Science is a joke, sure without science I wouldn’t have my PC, Flat screen TV, or my Xbox 360,  the good things, but without science we also wouldn’t have nuclear bombs, guns,and Global warming.[/quote]<br>

              <p>There have recently been videos of discovering left-out evidence off Noah’s ark in documentary films. I’ve also recently watched a few episodes of Ancient Aliens documentary and this topic appeared there, not that I personally fully support their theories about aliens doing everything and many times they quoted things and stories from the Bible which turn out to have happened, which once again proves that the book is not just a fantasy made up book, I believe it’s either translated wrongly or the people who have written all these scriptures interpreted it wrongly or whatever it is called.</p>

              <p>Everything happens for a reason. Bowser made me think of a great point I always like to bring up with mentioning feudalism. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>After the Bubonic Plague hit Europe and the Mediterranean area, over 40-50% of the population died. Now, surely nothing good can happen from 50% of the population dying, correct? Wrong. The current system set in place was called feudalism. With feudalism you would have a king with a bunch of land. He would then give this land to lord’s with the job of protecting his land. These lord’s would then hire knights to protect the land and would give them land in payment for their services. Lastly, these knights would enforce peasants to sow the fields and grow the crops. Peasants had no choice but to agree to do this, for if they didn’t they wouldn’t be under protection from bandits and would most likely die. When 50% of the population died, there wasn’t enough peasants to grow crops. Thus, peasants were able to ask for a wage to farm the land and hence the Renaissance period.</p>
<p>So to end this history lesson and to have a little moral of the story: Everything happens for a reason. Although everyone died on Earth with the great flood, more good may of come of it than harm. We just may never know.</p>
<p>Note: I do not consider The Bible to be a history book, but more a book of morals. I highly doubt the world was ever flooded and was most likely a story telling of God’s great prowess or whatnot.</p>

Without guns we would still have feudalism and we would die early because of no medical knowledge and religious negligence.  And takes historical numbers into account, between 20-50 million people died.  (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population_estimates" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population_estimates</a>)</p>
<p>Two way I got this number. Use the population number from 2500 BC (Flood), or use the number from 1500 years after the flood. (As this would give the same time for the population to grow since the creation.</p>

<p>Noah’s Ark, a popular story in Christianity is about the genocide of all species besides two animals of each species, one male and one female. The genocide is caused by God to “rid the world of all of its current evils,” yet the action is EXTREMELY evil. It’s the death of nearly everything. The animals that survived, survive because Noah creates a boat and boards all of these animals. Not only is that a ludicrous idea, one man getting all the animals onto the ship but even then where is the food for the animals and also that’d have to be a LARGE ship… What do you all think of this story?</p>
