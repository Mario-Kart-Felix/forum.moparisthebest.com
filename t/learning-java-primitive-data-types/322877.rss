[b]Can be used for[/b]: [i]A wide range of things very useful on a server.[/i]
[b]Difficulty[/b]: [i]3-10 (Depends how fast you can learn)[/i]
[b]Asumed Knowledge[/b]: [i]Knowledge of Understanding Java, and some C&amp;P.[/i]


[size=14pt]Chapter One: Learning the Data Types:[/size]

There are quite some data types in the Language of Java, and I will be explaining what they are in this tutorial. Please read very careful, as this chapter maybe important. The following are all Data types:

[list]Primitive Data Types:

[ul][li]Byte[/li]
[li]Short[/li]
[li]Int[/li]
[li]Long[/li]
[li]Float[/li]
[li]Double[/li]
[li]Boolean[/li]
[li]Char[/li]
[li]String[/li][/ul]



Now that we have learned all of the Primitive Data Types usable in Java, I am now going to discuss what each one of them can do.


The [b]Byte[/b] is a signed two&#39;s integer. The byte data type can be used for storing bytes for memory, in cases such as arrays and other methods. The byte Data is also another form of hte [b]Int[/b]. When using [b]Byte[/b] you would you: 

[code]public byte Name = 0;[/code]

However, there are different ways we could declare that, but we will not be discussing that in [b]This[/b] tutorial.


Next we have the [b]Short[/b]. The short is also another form of the [b]Int[/b]. The short can be used for storing Numeral Characters. However, the only different between [b]Short[/b] and [b]Int[/b] is that a Short can hold lesser value. To declare a [b]Short[/b], you would type:

[code]public short Name = 0;[/code]

Now we are at [b]Int[/b]. The Int is short for [b]Integer[/b]. An Int can be used for [b]Several[/b] things, and can be used for almost anything in Java. To declare an Int, simply type:

[code]public int Name = 0;[/code]

Now, we are at [b]Long[/b]. A long is a form of [b]Integer[/b], but can hold greater value then [b]Short[/b] or [b]Int[/b]. To declare this Data Type, you would type:

[code]public long Name = 0;[/code]

Ok, next of we have [b]Float[/b]. The float is a Single-Precision float point. Float is mainley used for savin Memory, however, it can be used otherwise. To declare, you would type:

[code]public float Name = 0;[/code]

Now we are at [b]boolean[/b]! The boolean is a variable used for true/false statements. It is only useful for flagging true/false in true/false conditions. You would declare by:

[code]public boolean Name = false[/code]

Next off, we have [b]Double[/b]. The [b]Double[/b] is another form of the [b]Float[/b]. The variable is good for decimal values or another numeral characters. To declare you would type:

[code]public double Name = 0;[/code]


Now we have [b]String[/b]. String is very useful. It can be used in cases to store text (In this case, Server&#39;s use Strings to store Usernames). You would type:

[code]public String Name = &quot;&quot;;[/code]


Now let&#39;s go to Chapter [b]Two[/b], for learning the range of values.




[size=14pt]Chapter Two: Learning the Data Type Values of Range:[/size]

[b]Byte[/b] can hold a minimum of [b]-128[/b] and a Maximum of [b]127[/b].
[b]Short[/b] can hold a minimum of [b]-32768[/b] and a Maximum of [b]32767[/b].
[b]Int[/b] can hold a minimum of [b]-2147483648[/b] and a Maximum of [b]2147483647[/b].
[b]Long[/b] can hold a minimum of [b]-9223372036854775808[/b] and a Maximum of [b]9223372036854775807[/b].
[b]Char[/b] cam hold a minimum of [b]\u0000[/b] (or) [b]0[/b] and a Maximum of [b]\uffff[/b] (or) [b]65535[/b].


Thanks for reading my tutorial :) I hope all of you find this useful, as it did for me when I was a beginner. If you have any questions, [b]PM Me, Comment, or E-Mail at Kay652009@yahoo.com[/b].</description>
