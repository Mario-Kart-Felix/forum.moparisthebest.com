    <description>Can someone give me how they thought there was a god? If there is a god, who created him... I just do not understand. A god just cant appear from who the fuck knows where, then create living creatures. Thats just my opinion. Tell me yours. :confused:</description>

<p>I only mention this because it is extremely hypocritical, and I hope it will not be brought into this argument.</p>
<p>Ask the same person who made God, the response is, “He was always there.”</p>

<p>Video is pure bullshit.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It didn’t come out of nothing. You can’t ask how it got there, because I can easily ask “How did “God” get there?” in which case you would reply, “He was always there,” and I could easily say, “likewise.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do not say that the universe is “perfect” for human life. Our Earth is, most definitely habitable, but then why isn’t Mars, or Jupiter, or Mercury habitable. Wouldn’t “God” make the best for his “children.” Also, inference != fact, and I do most certainly believe that the universe has to come to be what it is today because of random events. Mathematics, logic, and science are all products of the human mind, and they are that perfect because we made them to suit our needs, regardless of how mindless or accidental we are, the product of our minds is perfect enough for us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Morals are taught to us by society, which is also what we made ourselves for our cadence and order in our society. They are taught to us to be second-nature so that our society can be relatively orderly. “It is wrong to murder…” (the example given) is literally us being taught second-nature not to murder, so that society will function. If “God” wanted to instill these “morals” into us, then why didn’t he, and instead make murderers and rapists in the streets. Don’t say “free will,” because these “morals” should apparently be, as the video said, “instinctual”. The murderers/rapists/etc. were either not taught those, or have a skewed perspective (a.k.a. conscious, a.k.a not instinctive) therefore “God” could not have instilled them into us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See <span class="hashtag">#2</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was too busy laughing my ass off to watch the rest, so… yeah…</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, one more question for you: If “God” is omnipotent, what is the point of sex when he can just “zap” the baby into the womb as he [supposedly] did with Jesus. If I recall correctly, the Christian church prohibits sex other than for procreation, so why not eliminate it completely by just “God” making the woman pregnant after she and her partner get married.</p>

I’m surprised nobody has yet mentioned Epicurus’ problem of evil.<br>

the philosophy of religion and theology, the problem of evil is the problem of reconciling the existence of evil or suffering in the world with the existence of God.[1] The problem is most often discussed in the context of the personal god of the Abrahamic religions, but is also relevant to polytheistic traditions involving many gods.<br>

How do you explain diseases? I doubt idiots who followed a book their entire life can create nonhuman (a.k.a. virii, hostile bacteria,e tc.) life.<br>
What about natural disasters? I doubt humans can create hurricanes and tornadoes (and please don’t say, “we caused global warming… etc” because those [natural disasters] existed way before the combustion engine)</p>
<p>As stated by Epicurus himself. “If God is potent enough and willing enough to eradicate evil, then why not do it? If he is potent enoguh but not willing to, is he not evil himself? And if he is not potent enough to do so, is he not a god?”</p>

<p>Stop forcing this discussion around in circles. We’re perfect because of evolution, and if you refuse to bother understanding it then that’s your fault and you shouldn’t be telling us that there is a god.</p>
<p>If you actually knew anything more about evolution than ‘we evolved from monkeys and birds evolved from cats’ then you could put forward a few decent points countering this theory - otherwise it’s not going to make fucking sense is it, a cat turning into a bird over 4000 years?</p>
<p>When you people say to us that you’re not a monkey and it’s not logical that a rabbit can be a randomly mutated lizard, it just shows us your own ignorance. Not that your a christian, it just shows that you haven’t thought outside the box when at primary school you were spoonfed this theory.</p>

<p>Actually I know more than that you idiot. I have to watch sessions of this shit… Debates and everything how about y’all learn about the science leaning towards a god?

Make me a list of the points he says and what you have to say about it. Unless you disprove every point he says in all 7 of his seminars, with physical evidence. Then I will keep believing in a God. And we both know your not going to do that, and if you do your gonna be bullshitting everything. Because its harder to disprove something that’s real then it is to that something that is not.<br>

Which brings us all back to the fundamental point: If there was an ancient book from 2000 years ago describing an omnipotent, omnipresent, invisible flying spaghetti monster ruling the world would you believe it? If you believe in a god then I’m sure you’d believe in the flying spaghetti monster if things were different.[/quote]<br>
No, Believing in a God Isn’t illogical. If you really ponder on the earth… Dude I have no fucking doubt in mind their was a designer. I don’t believe it just got like this over time of evolving, Period.</p>

There is no way either to prove or disprove a god. So, considering that… There is no real way of knowing. Just look around you every once in a while. Its perfect… and we will also know in the end what is true and what isn’t.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Stop forcing this discussion around in circles. We’re perfect because of evolution, and if you refuse to bother understanding it then that’s your fault and you shouldn’t be telling us that there is a god.</p>
<p>If you actually knew anything more about evolution than ‘we evolved from monkeys and birds evolved from cats’ then you could put forward a few decent points countering this theory - otherwise it’s not going to make fucking sense is it, a cat turning into a bird over 4000 years?</p>
<p>When you people say to us that you’re not a monkey and it’s not logical that a rabbit can be a randomly mutated lizard, it just shows us your own ignorance. Not that your a christian, it just shows that you haven’t thought outside the box when at primary school you were spoonfed this theory.[/quote]<br>
Actually I know more than that you idiot. I have to watch sessions of this shit… Debates and everything how about y’all learn about the science leaning towards a god? Instead of <span class="bbcode-b">assuming</span> there isn’t one. <a href="http://freehovind.com/watch-4308235066145651150" rel="nofollow noopener">http://freehovind.com/watch-4308235066145651150</a> &lt;- watch that 2 hour long video. Make me a list of the points he says and what you have to say about it. Unless you disprove every point he says in all 7 of his seminars, with physical evidence. Then I will keep believing in a God. And we both know your not going to do that, and if you do your gonna be bullshitting everything. Because its harder to disprove something that’s real then it is to that something that is not.</p>

<p>lets suppose for a moment that what you said is plausible (it isnt)</p>
<p>how do you explain radioactivity?<br>
you have a rock of metal with some uranium and lead, as time goes on, we see the uranium turn into lead.<br>
logically, the lead is only there because uranium changed into it, there must have been a time when the lump of metal was 100% uranium.<br>
we know the rate uranium changes into lead, if we count back to the time when it was 100% uranium, we can see the rock is around 3.5 billion years old.<br>
therefore the earth is at least that old. (the currently accepted age is 4.55 billion)</p>
