    <description>I tried finding a spot where other people were playing Minecraft on their 360, but I couldnt really.. if there is a threaed, please tell me where it is.


Ok, First of all, if you play minecraft on your 360, and want to play with other people, please feel free to post your GamerTag.

My GamerTag is [b]El1t3Maxx.[/b]

If you would like to see my world, then send me a messege, and lets get together.. I dont mind starting over and playing on a game with other people, as that would be more fun anyways.

Also... I am unfortunate enough... to not have a mic yet.. so if we do play together, then You can talk, and il listen to you. And if i want something really bad, il just send you a messege.

And just so you know, Im going to be on my xbox, So if you want to play, then just hit me up on the good ol&#39; xbox.


just a quick update on what ive been doing... 

I made a land-bridge over the water
I made a pretty big cave system
Added a guest house ( made out of cobelstone)
Planted trees to make the sceneary look better


Im doing a bit of work, anyone wanna help? I need more then just me working on it lol.... i run out of idea so i just start to wing it... and being that i just started playing this game yesterday, im still learning, so if someone wanted to play with me and teach me, that would be cool. :D</description>

<p>I don’t understand how this works. People buy games, like my friend; he bought Diablo 3, and has not tried to play it yet, instead going to play WoW. He has had it for about 3 days already. If you buy agame I thought that people would try to start playing right when they get it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
