              <p>well first of all silabsoft is a noob theres no such thing as silab items they are all made by jagex, she does jack and no-one cares about her</p>
<p>now first of all, you have to get a client and a server source if u have 1 and then look on the tutâ€™s section and it says how to make it compatible with the new items look there</p>
