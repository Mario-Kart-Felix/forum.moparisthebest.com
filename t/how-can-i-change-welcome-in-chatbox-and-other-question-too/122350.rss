    <description>Hello, 

Question #1:
How can I change &quot;sendMessage&quot; when.. uh.. for the example. When somone logg in my server, there some words in chatbox like &quot;Welcome to Fr33sc4p3!, do not build anything unless you are on ::con!&quot;, ects. Is that possible to change the welcome message?


Question #2:
While I&#39;m playing on my server, there some words on the top of screen likes, &quot;Co-Owner: Fr33sc4p3&quot; and &quot;There are * player online&quot;. Hey, I&#39;m owner, and my username is &quot;cheesy_g13&quot; -.-
How can i change it?


Question #3:
How can I change for NPC to say something above the NPC&#39;s head (I&#39;m new on coder, i want to start with that kind of talk style).


Question #4:
When I just log in, there some &quot;menu&quot; appear. How can I change that what menu will say?


Thank you! ~Cheesy

P.S. I&#39;m using Fr33sc4p3 Pkz source. If you have no idea what freescape&#39;s source really have.. just post. And I will just try  ;)

P.S.S. Please, if you have some answer for some question. Please say what kind of question are you answering on. Or say &quot;I&#39;m answering on question #2&quot;, or so like that.

THANK YOU! :)</description>

How can I change “sendMessage” when… uh… for the example. When somone logg in my server, there some words in chatbox like “Welcome to Fr33sc4p3!, do not build anything unless you are on ::con!”, ects. Is that possible to change the welcome message?</p>
<p>Just search for what the message says and change it in “Client.java”</p>
<p>Question <span class="hashtag">#2:</span><br>
While I’m playing on my server, there some words on the top of screen likes, “Co-Owner: Fr33sc4p3” and “There are * player online”. Hey, I’m owner, and my username is “cheesy_g13” -.-<br>
How can i change it?</p>
<p>Once again, search for it in client.java and change it.</p>
<p>Question <span class="hashtag">#3:</span><br>
How can I change for NPC to say something above the NPC’s head (I’m new on coder, i want to start with that kind of talk style).</p>
<p>Search for “Moo” in NPCHandler and add this under it</p>
<p><code>    if (npcs[i].npcType == XXX) {
     if (misc.random2(25) == 1) {
      npcs[i].updateRequired = true;
      npcs[i].textUpdateRequired = true;
      npcs[i].textUpdate = "TYPE WHAT YOU WANT IT TO SAY HERE";
     }
    }</code></p>
<p>Change the “TYPE WHAT YOU WANT IT TO SAY HERE” to what you want the NPC to say and change the “XXX” to the NPC ID. Youcan also change the 25 in this line</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (misc.random2(25) == 1) {</code></pre>
<p>To a bigger or smaller number to make it say it slower or faster, big for slow, small for fast.</p>
<p>Question <span class="hashtag">#4:</span><br>
When I just log in, there some “menu” appear. How can I change that what menu will say?</p>
<p>Search for what it says or search for like public void helpmenu() and change the sendquests under it.</p>
