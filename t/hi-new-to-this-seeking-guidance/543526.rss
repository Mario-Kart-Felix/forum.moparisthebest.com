<p>I will see if that works for the PkP Shop and let you know how it goes.</p>
<p>So, basically I can just delete the donor shop altogether, and add the items to NPC drops in the drop tables? I think I will have to remove the donor requirement on the items as well, which I think I know how to do.</p>
<p>I believe I set it up correctly, because I didn’t get any errors aside from the warnings in Eclipse. I just find that searching in the root Server folder is simply than trying to sift through all the stuff on Eclipse, unless there’s a similar search feature in Eclipse that i’m unaware of, I’m fine doing it this way for now… haha.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your reply. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I’m also trying to deal with this:<br>
<img src="http://i61.tinypic.com/2yweddj.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
I CANNOT remove this forge door. Any ideas?</p>
<p>Also, I managed to get these thieving stalls in here and facing the right direction, but when I steal from the Topaz stall, it changes direction. I know it has something to do with the positioning of the Empty stall during the ‘cooldown’ period, but I don’t know where to find that.<br>

<p>Now the code for turing in artifacts is;</p>
<p><code>if (c.getItems().playerHasItem(14876,1)) { //if the item is the artifact (id = 14876)

		c.getVariables().pkp += 15;</code> //give pk points</p>
<p>How would I change this to give gold instead?[/quote]</p>
<p>Basically you would delete the last line giving the pk points and replace it with a line giving items. I’m assuming such methode would be in c.getItems() as well… Probabaly something like c.getItems().addItem(id, amount).</p>

              <p>Well it doesn’t need to be 562, we just don’t want anything in the 700s. I’d also prefer not to start with something too difficult, because I don’t want to get frustrated before I get in the groove of applying myself and learning through trial and error. I’m stuck because I feel like starting with a feature-rich server will present me fewer opportunities to make the server truly mine while at the same time I feel like starting with a blank server with my lack of coding knowledge will be biting off more than I can chew. haha. My brother and I will have to make a decision.</p>

<p>Well… I’ve run into a problem. I’ve tried a few sources both blank and feature-rich and it seems that the RSPS Download section is too outdated. Most of the download links didn’t work, and the one’s that did work were just really bad servers that some 15 year old went ape shit on with adding every tutorial he could find. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"> I’m kinda lost now.</p>

              <blockquote>Well first, which version are you looking for? 
<p>As for the rest of the problems, that is just a matter of changing some numbers. Rock crabs have a special death animation, and when the server doesn’t know which one it is they just send a generic one, usually fit for humanoids. The same goes for the woodcutting animation. Trees/Ores disappearing would require a way to keep track of object states and update all clients of the changes. It isn’t very hard but most servers don’t have a nice system in place for it.</p>
<p>Developing and managing a server take quite a bit of time, but if you guys were able to wait a few years for better equipment you should have no problem with the time investment. The most important thing to remember is that your player base will be a little more understanding of problems if you can show them you are dedicated to the well-being of the server and not your wallets.</p>

<p>Thank you for a quick response!</p>
<p>We are interested in using a 562 version. Although we would really like to have our server set up like the current BattleScape which includes a feature that allows changing the graphics version in the client, we aren’t ready for that yet, I don’t think. So yea, 562 is what we are looking at.</p>
<p>Thanks for the information on those minor bugs, also! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>I agree with you there, we did wait a long time to put this plan in motion, so I hope once we gain some players they recognize our commitment to the server.</p>

<p>[ol][li]What is a good source/client combo to use for beginners? Would you recommend using a server with tons of content already, or would you recommend using a blank server and adding things on our own?[/li]<br>
[li]Many servers we’ve played have had NPC models that were glitchy. For instance a Rock Crab’s death/attack animation were stretchy and glitched. How do we prevent this from happening in our server?[/li]<br>
[li]What are some tutorials/threads we should read to make this process more educational and easier on us as time goes on?[/li]<br>
[li]In your opinion, what is the difficulty of fixing simple bugs like a Steel Hatchet always being displayed when you chop wood regardless of your equipped hatchet? Or Trees and Ores not disappearing when being harvested?[/li]<br>
[li]How difficult do you think it will be for us to transition into Private Server Owner statuses? meaning simply how hard is it to build a server and manage it as a beginner? We’re just trying to gauge the level of commitment and understand what’s expected of us as up and coming server developers.[/li][/ol][/quote]<br>
Well first, which version are you looking for?</p>
<p>As for the rest of the problems, that is just a matter of changing some numbers. Rock crabs have a special death animation, and when the server doesn’t know which one it is they just send a generic one, usually fit for humanoids. The same goes for the woodcutting animation. Trees/Ores disappearing would require a way to keep track of object states and update all clients of the changes. It isn’t very hard but most servers don’t have a nice system in place for it.</p>
<p>Developing and managing a server take quite a bit of time, but if you guys were able to wait a few years for better equipment you should have no problem with the time investment. The most important thing to remember is that your player base will be a little more understanding of problems if you can show them you are dedicated to the well-being of the server and not your wallets.</p>
