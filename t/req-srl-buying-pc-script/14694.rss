    <title>[REQ][SRL]Buying PC Script</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-srl-buying-pc-script/14694</link>
    <description>Ok, I&#39;m buying a working Pest Control Script that uses SRL. It has to be undetectable as much as possible, and pretty accurate (I&#39;ll be watching it). I need to first make sure it works because I&#39;ve noticed many scripts have a problem running on my computer. I WILL NOT scam in any way. Say what you would like for it; I can only pay in RS2 GP. Please post here if you have any questions or comments.

Thanks
