    <description>Has anyone else seen this?

In short, it&#39;s about the creation of Facebook and all the dilemmas that were faced in the making of it.

Personally, I thought that this was a great movie, maybe because I specifically like movies that are not so much revolved around Facebook but instead around college life. The story of this movie was basically told through speech and I thought that Jesse Eisenberg played his character as Mark Zuckerberg very, very well. I would recommend it to anyone. That is all.
