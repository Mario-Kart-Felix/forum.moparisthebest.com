    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-have-a-tut-for-fully-working-stake-and-getting-100-prayers/72160</link>
    <description>Does anyone have a tut for fully working stake and getting 100% prayers?  I mean I have the prayer icons in my client, but now I want the prayers to work.  All help IS appreciated.
