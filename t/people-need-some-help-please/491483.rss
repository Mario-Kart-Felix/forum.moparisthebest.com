    <description>hey people i need some help.
the problem is there was a button called &quot;info&quot; and when i clicked it the info of the weapon came up but it had coins at the bottom of it and i wanted it to be tokens so i removed the whole info bit but is there anyway i could make it so that when ever somebody clicks info a message will come up and say how much it is please somebody respond ill screen it to show you if you don&#39;t understand me

it was like this:
http://scr.hu/0kmz/jgys5

http://scr.hu/0kmz/5qxn5
