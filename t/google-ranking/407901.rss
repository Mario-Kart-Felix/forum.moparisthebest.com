    <title>Google Ranking</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/google-ranking/407901</link>
    <description>Im currently starting to upgrade some of my web packages that I offer to customers. I want to be able to add Google Ranking to get their site onto page 1 for certain search terms.

for example, http://www.tpsl.co.uk I want these terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Harrogate Computer Repairs&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Harrogate Computer Support&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To show on the first page, however I have submitted it to google, yahoo and bing, I have put a SEO title and added keywords to the page content along with a h1 with the search term i want most. I have been adding reviews to websites such as yell.com and yelp in the hope that more content generated about the website will increase traffic thus increase its rankings.

What im asking you is have you had experience in generating rankings, or have you got any documents which you can forward me that I can read to aid me.

Thanks</description>

[/quote]Dear Google,</p>
<p>I’ve always wondered how websites (such as the one you showed in that picture) are able to generate dynamic content that ends up with high PageRanks. Wouldn’t you (Google) at least have the sense in realizing that the “fake content to adverts and other affiliates” are coming through your (Google) algorithms? Or is this intentional?</p>

[/quote]It’s hard to weed those people out, as the ones that are done well use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloaking" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">cloaking</a>. For extremely specific keywords or keywords with low amount of searches, it’s often the case that through cloaking or what-have-you, the blackhat SEO’er actually appears to have better content than any of the other competitors for said keywords. It’s not really google’s fault, as it would be impractical to completely verify that a cloaked site is legit in some cases (not to mention hard as fuck, since the whole point of cloaking is to deceive google) and also go against their standards (user-agent for example). I would wager that the majority of the time when you end up at sites like that, though, you fucked up your google-fu. There are certain keywords that you should add to your searches to ensure the proper type of content is presented. For example, when you type “some amazing non-existent torrent” in google, without “download” as a keyword, google doesn’t know you want to download that torrent. If you did, then maybe it could verify that the sites it indexed had downloadable content for that keyword.[/quote]Specifically speaking about torrents: it’s best to just put effort into obtaining private tracker accounts; if you have enough, you can find pretty much anything on the Internet. Last I checked, if you can’t find something on private trackers, you can’t find it on the Internet (excluding Deep Web).</p>

<p>Agreed.  Don’t you think if any site could pay to get to the top of google they probably would? And how exactly can all sites be at the top of google?  SEO just means someone is trying to scam you.  I wish I could think of nice explanatory words to go with SEO, what about “Scam Everyone Online”, since that is really their goal?</p>

              <p>Add a good description, a lot of keywords, and get the site linked to from external sources. A domain name which contains similar text to what people would be searching for also helps. For example, I had a website where you could look up RuneScape experience values and the domain was <a href="http://runescapeexptable.com" rel="nofollow noopener">runescapeexptable.com</a>; I got ranked to like <span class="hashtag">#4</span> when you searched for runescape exp table, runescape experience table, etc. The only ones that were higher ranked were Tip.it and RuneScape Wikia.</p>

<p>So basically, you want to charge people for SEO, but you don’t know anything about SEO?</p>

</aside>
<p>I want to read and learn about how I can do it so that I can charge people for it, I wouldn’t charge someone for something that I dont understand. Im posting here asking for <span class="bbcode-i">advice and information</span>.</p>
<p>I have used google to search but there seems to be quite a few contrasting blogs and articles, im merely asking for help on finding the answer.</p>

              <p>Im currently starting to upgrade some of my web packages that I offer to customers. I want to be able to add Google Ranking to get their site onto page 1 for certain search terms.</p>
<p>for example, <a href="http://www.tpsl.co.uk" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.tpsl.co.uk</a> I want these terms:</p>
<blockquote>Harrogate Computer Repairs</blockquote>
<blockquote>Harrogate Computer Support</blockquote>
<p>To show on the first page, however I have submitted it to google, yahoo and bing, I have put a SEO title and added keywords to the page content along with a h1 with the search term i want most. I have been adding reviews to websites such as <a href="http://yell.com" rel="nofollow noopener">yell.com</a> and yelp in the hope that more content generated about the website will increase traffic thus increase its rankings.</p>
<p>What im asking you is have you had experience in generating rankings, or have you got any documents which you can forward me that I can read to aid me.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
