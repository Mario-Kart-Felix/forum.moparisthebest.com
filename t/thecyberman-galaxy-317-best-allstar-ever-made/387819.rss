    <title>TheCyberMan-Galaxy 317 ~Best Allstar Ever Made~</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/thecyberman-galaxy-317-best-allstar-ever-made/387819</link>
    <description>Hello,

I had, for a few months, familiarized myself with some basic Java when coding this.  I now know how to make a lot for this Allstar base.  I simply wish for your input on what thing/things I should add before I quit making my RSPS.  My info on the server is here:

[url=http://www.thecyberman.com/galaxy/features.html]TheCyberMan-Galaxy[/url]

What do you guys think? Is it worth developing more (even though I already stopped for 3 months)?


TheCyberMan


EDIT:

I have had difficulty keeping my 317 server hosting on my MacBook without shutting down in an hour (if even that lucky).  For a couple months, a person with a horrible Windows XP Desktop, that had about 4 GB Harddrive space left, hosted it. Even that caused shut downs after a few hours; though, that was expected.  

I have a splendid Macintosh Desktop with 2.26Ghz, 4 GB Ram, and 1.07 Ghz Bus Speed (it needs to be upgraded to Snow Leopard to even host, so I have not tested it yet).  I am willing to host a server 24/7 but this is where I need your help...how do I keep it running? If it&#39;s a desktop, does it tend to run more hours than a laptop?  Assuming it won&#39;t continuously run, do any of you have a Terminal shell file that reboots my type of server every few hours like a &quot;voule.bat?&quot; Do you have advice or methods to keep it running?



Thank You!



P.S.
There is so much info that I ran past the character limit when I tried putting my server information here. I mean no advertising whatsoever.</description>

<p>That is exactly my second main reason why I stayed with an Allstar base! It can be very flexible realistically (like Runescape) or creatively (experiments with coding)! The same applies with Delta, but Delta is more popular and updated organizationally. Though since I had gone so far into my Allstar base, by the time I found out Delta is a comparable source that’s more popular, I didn’t want switch since I made so much.  Honestly though, do you think all that I did could be done as easily with a PI source (I’m not saying that all I did was easy)? That source scares me a bit because it’s so different.[/quote]</p>

              <p>That’s a splendid idea! Cleaning up Allstar’s code and simplifying mine would improve the server. I look forward to working on this thoroughly again in the summer! The problem that made me stop mainly was buying a VPS…or else I would have to keep dealing with having someone use their PC (I have a mac) to host it and the server constantly shut down.</p>

              <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I had, for a few months, familiarized myself with some basic Java when coding this.  I now know how to make a lot for this Allstar base.  I simply wish for your input on what thing/things I should add before I quit making my RSPS.  My info on the server is here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thecyberman.com/galaxy/features.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">TheCyberMan-Galaxy</a></p>
<p>What do you guys think? Is it worth developing more (even though I already stopped for 3 months)?</p>
<p>TheCyberMan</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>I have had difficulty keeping my 317 server hosting on my MacBook without shutting down in an hour (if even that lucky).  For a couple months, a person with a horrible Windows XP Desktop, that had about 4 GB Harddrive space left, hosted it. Even that caused shut downs after a few hours; though, that was expected.</p>
<p>I have a splendid Macintosh Desktop with 2.26Ghz, 4 GB Ram, and 1.07 Ghz Bus Speed (it needs to be upgraded to Snow Leopard to even host, so I have not tested it yet).  I am willing to host a server 24/7 but this is where I need your help…how do I keep it running? If it’s a desktop, does it tend to run more hours than a laptop?  Assuming it won’t continuously run, do any of you have a Terminal shell file that reboots my type of server every few hours like a “voule.bat?” Do you have advice or methods to keep it running?</p>
<p>Thank You!</p>
<p>P.S.<br>
There is so much info that I ran past the character limit when I tried putting my server information here. I mean no advertising whatsoever.</p>
