    <title>What questions would you like to ask the community?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-questions-would-you-like-to-ask-the-community/426381</link>
    <description>When I put RSCD&#39;s new site up I&#39;m going to host as many polls as possible which will decide the path/route of where the server goes. What would you ask the community?

I need the question and the multiple choice answers, such as:

[b]How should rare items be introduced?[/b]

[ol][li]Manual world drop on the holidays[/li]
[li]Dropped by NPCs[/li]
[li]Rewards for referral count[/li]
[li]Don&#39;t drop rare items![/li][/ol]</description>

<p>Source code contains implementation details, optimizations, data structures, ideas, interaction with the rest of the application, etc.  Most conversations cover one or two of those, and I’ve never even heard of someone claiming a conversation contains more knowledge than source code.</p>
<p>If you know of a conversation that is more informative than can be extracted from the actual code, then I would absolutely love to see it.</p>

<p>Color bots don’t modify the client, the only data that Jagex can look at is bot-like actions like strange mouse movements.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to see what the anti-bot techniques for this new server will be. If it’s what I think then it will rule out everyone who is only used to Java bots and the client’s class files being available.</p>
