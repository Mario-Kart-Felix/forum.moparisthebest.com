[B][U]Brief description:[/U][/B]
This is not just some remake, this is the real thing. The old Dodian days are back! The very same community from the good ol&#39; days have stayed together through numerous sites and servers in an attempt to feel the same as they did when they played Dodian. Unfortunately NO server could ever fill the gap. This time around we are banding together and bring back those good times with an original Dodian source along with that very same lovable community. If you played Dodian back in the day, you know why so many loved the server. If you liked Dodian, give us a try. We hope to see many new players, as well as some old faces!


[B][U]Meet the community:[/U][/B]
The community has been together for years even after Dodian went down. We&#39;ve had a lot of good times, and a lot of bad. We&#39;ve all roamed other sites to find the same type of community we loved so much but we keep coming back together to create a server, finally we&#39;ve done it! We have made it to this point and everyone is loving it. We have fully functional, active, MyBB forum that will be sure to catch your attention and keep you coming back.

Many of our staff are Dodian vets. We are all fully dedicated to the community and the server. We are looking to make our community go far and share the glory days with everyone once again.
