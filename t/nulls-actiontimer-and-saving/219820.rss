    <description>can someone help me with anti-null... i have an anti-null code but still like 10 nulls get on be4 restarts.

and people mass-click teleport and raise stats fast, and i wondered how to get actiontimers to work. I made actionTImer = 5 on each teleport but then i could tele once and then it wouldn&#39;t work again till i relogged../

a third thing is can someone help me get the thing to save char files alot. Because people ALWAYS get reset and their stats go back to 1... how do i get it to save alot so this doesn&#39;t happen?</description>
