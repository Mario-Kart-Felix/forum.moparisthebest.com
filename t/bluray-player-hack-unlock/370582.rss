    <title>Bluray Player Hack/Unlock?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bluray-player-hack-unlock/370582</link>
    <description>I picked up a Magnavox MBP5120F this morning. It&#39;s a bluray player that also has the option for an online service called Vudu. Not surprisingly though, the prices for Vudu are high compared to renting a redbox disc or something similar.

What I was wondering was if there were forums for unlocking these players(as there are with phones, mp3 players, etc) so I could use a different service or possibly something like Hulu to stream to my tv.

If anyone knows anything about it or could point me in the right direction, it would be greatly appreciated  ;D

Thanks</description>
