    <description>Hey guys, not sure if this is in the right section, but I need some help with my rsps forums. I&#39;m using SMF 2.0 and I need to know how to make one of my threads a mandatory read. Like when someone tries to browse the forums. it will say &quot;There&#39;s a thread that the administrators want you to read before browsing the forums.&quot; I saw it on the Runeasteria forums, (Shut down private server) and ever since I wanted to figure out how to do that.</description>
