    <description>I have recently got into coding and only have breif knowledge in it.

In my coding I have kind of &quot;Hit a dead end&quot; and I don&#39;t know what to do.

I am trying to make it so when you kill a player in the wilderness you get 1 PK point and it you get a message saying &quot;You killed ...Player... and receive 1 PK point.

Here are the codes that are causing the problem:

[QUOTE]	}
public void killmessage() {
			client killerz = (client) server.playerHandler.players[KillerId];
                    client playerz = (client) server.playerHandler.players[playerId];
			int message = misc.random(8);
 followID2 = 0;
 followID = 0;
			if(message == 0)
				killerz.sM(&quot;With a crushing blow, you defeat &quot; + playerz.playerName + &quot;.&quot;);
			else if(message == 1)
				killerz.sM(&quot;It&#39;s a humiliating defeat for &quot; + playerz.playerName + &quot;.&quot;);
			else if(message == 2) 
				killerz.sM(&quot;&quot; + playerz.playerName + &quot; didn&#39;t stand a chance against you.&quot;);
			else if(message == 3) 
				killerz.sM(&quot;You have defeated &quot; + playerz.playerName + &quot;.&quot;);
			else if(message == 4) 
				killerz.sM(&quot;&quot; + playerz.playerName + &quot; regrets the day they met you in combat.&quot;);
			else if(message == 5) 
				killerz.sM(&quot;It&#39;s all over for &quot; + playerz.playerName + &quot;.&quot;);
			else if(message == 6) 
				killerz.sM(&quot;&quot; + playerz.playerName + &quot; falls before your might.&quot;);
			else if(message == 7)
				killerz.sM(&quot;Can anyone defeat you? Certainly not &quot; + playerz.playerName + &quot;.&quot;);
			else if(message == 8) 
				killerz.sM(&quot;You were clearly a better fighter than &quot; + playerz.playerName + &quot;.&quot;);
}[/QUOTE]

As you can see it displays one of 8 death messages randomly but the problem is its not showing any.

Here are the codes I want it to use:

[QUOTE]killerz.sM(&quot;You Killed &quot; + playerz.playerName + &quot; and receive 1 PK point.&quot;);
killerz.dpoints += 1;
[/QUOTE]

Could anyone re-code this for me so it works the way I have requested?

Thanks

<p>What the fuck? Just make a token, then add it to your death method like so.</p>
<p><code>killerz.pkPoints += 1;
</code></p>
<p>Change the killmessage method to this:</p>
<p><code>public void killmessage() {
         int message = misc.random(8);
 followID2 = 0;
 followID = 0;
         if(message == 0)
            sM("With a crushing blow, you defeat " + playerz.playerName + ".");
         } else if(message == 1)
            sM("It's a humiliating defeat for " + playerz.playerName + ".");
         } else if(message == 2) 
            sM("" + playerz.playerName + " didn't stand a chance against you.");
         } else if(message == 3) 
            sM("You have defeated " + playerz.playerName + ".");
         } else if(message == 4) 
            sM("" + playerz.playerName + " regrets the day they met you in combat.");
         } else if(message == 5) 
            sM("It's all over for " + playerz.playerName + ".");
         } else if(message == 6) 
            sM("" + playerz.playerName + " falls before your might.");
         } else if(message == 7)
            sM("Can anyone defeat you? Certainly not " + playerz.playerName + ".");
         } else if(message == 8) 
            sM("You were clearly a better fighter than " + playerz.playerName + ".");
}</code></p>
<p>Then simply add this to your death method.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">killerz.killmessage();</code></pre>
