              <p>As a run argument, tell the VM or system (I have no idea to which the arguments are directed) to reserve some more memory for the JVM.<br>
Look it up on Google about the arguments; I think it was -Xmx though I’m not certain.</p>
<p>EDIT: here, I looked it up for you;<br>
-Xms5000m<br>
That reserves 5000 megabytes for the JVM. ‘m’ indicates megabytes and ‘k’ indicates kilobytes.<br>
The default should be +/- 2000 megabytes.</p>
