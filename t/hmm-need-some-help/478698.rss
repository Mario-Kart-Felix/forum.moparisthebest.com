    <description>Hey mopar, I&#39;m trying to add crowns (such as @cr1@) in yell
Here&#39;s the code for one that I put in my class30_sub2_sub1_sub4,
[code]
							if (s.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;cr1&quot;))
									aClass30_sub2_sub1_sub1Array1219[0].method348(inthere, 16083, inthere)
[/code]
what should I put for the inthere? And is there anything else I should do? (btw I put 0 on both of them to see if it would compile and it did, so now I just need to know the stuff I should put for inthere)</description>
