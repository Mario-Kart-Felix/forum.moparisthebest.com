    <description>Hey,
when i attack an NPC it shows the damage on the npc but my weapon doesn&#39;t move. nothing moves. But when i go and pk people, my weapon moves normally.
any ideas on how to fix that?

and how can i get something like this?

so that when i click a portal it gives me all those options, and when i click one of them, it teles me there!
I found one like it on my client. And copy pasted it and changed the object. So now when I click the portal that comes up. But it teles me to the spot where I copy pasted from. How do I change that without changing the tele spot from where I copied?</description>
