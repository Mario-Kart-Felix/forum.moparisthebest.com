    <title>[PI] Simple Upgrade System</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-simple-upgrade-system/543103</link>
    <description>Hey guys this is my first tutorial and I would like to show you how to make it so that items can be upgraded this is the simplest way possible of doing it.

Files that will be edited:
itemdef.java
clickitem2.java

Client Sided:

Open your client and search for &quot;itemdef.java&quot; and open it up.
Now you have openend itemdef.java add in this:

		case ####:
		itemDef.itemActions = new String[5];
		itemDef.itemActions[2] = &quot;##########&quot;;
	break;

Explanation:

		case ####:
The #### is the item id that you will be adding the right click upgrade ability to.

		itemDef.itemActions[2] = &quot;##########&quot;;
The ########## is the text that you will see when you right click the item.

Example:

		case 6570: //fire cape id code
		itemDef.itemActions = new String[5];
		itemDef.itemActions[2] = &quot;Upgrade Fire-Cape&quot;; //right click text
	break;

Save and compile that is all we needed to so client sided

Server Sided:

For the server sided section we will be using the class file &quot;itemclick2.java&quot; you can locate this file by searching for itemclick2 in the search bar within the folder or you can locate this class file by
src &gt; server &gt; model &gt; players &gt; packets

Ok now we have opened the class file put this in there:

case ####:
	c.sendMessage(&quot;###########&quot;);
	if (c.getItems().playerHasItem(####,####)) {
c.getItems().deleteItem(####,####);
c.getItems().addItem(####,####);
}		
break;

Explanation:


case ####:
The #### is the id of the item that will have the right click option of upgrade as we did in the client sided section.

	c.sendMessage(&quot;###########&quot;);
This bit of code isn&#39;t nessasry but you can use it if you like this will send a message in the chat box after you have upgraded your item.

	if (c.getItems().playerHasItem(####,####)) {
this is the currency of which the item will take to upgrade and the amout of which it will take
#### =  item id and #### is the amout of the item that you will need to upgrade.

c.getItems().deleteItem(####,####);
even though this is self explanatry all your will need to do is copy the id and the amour that we entered above.

c.getItems().addItem(####,####);
This bit of code will exchange you the upgraded item for the currency we added above.
#### = upgraded item id and #### = the amout of the upgraded item.

Example:

case 6570:
	c.sendMessage(&quot;You Upgrade Your Fire Cape Into A TokHaar-Kal&quot;);
	if (c.getItems().playerHasItem(2996,100)) {
c.getItems().deleteItem(2996,100);
c.getItems().addItem(7009,1);
c.sendMessage(&quot;Here is your Tokhaar-Kal&quot;);
}
break;

and then you&#39;re done save and compile.

 I hope you all enjoy I know it is simple but some beginners might not know.</description>
