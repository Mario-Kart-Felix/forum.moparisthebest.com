WarScape 317 was made to feel like Battle-scape 1 with a little twist on things. I loved playing bs1 pretty shur a lot other&#39;s did to. My partner and I put in a lot of work to be getting this done. Everything was made for a Eco/Pk community. We are still editing the mini-games also finding more and more bugs. Were intending to take a lot of suggestions to make the game more better for you.
