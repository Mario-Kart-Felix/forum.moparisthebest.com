    <title>How to copy files from your server to another</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-copy-files-from-your-server-to-another/320193</link>
    <description>this usually comes in handy when you are starting on another server, using two servers with different ips (say like two worlds on runescape), or making something like a pvp server (which is what i am doing).

The difficulty of this should not be hard it is basicly copy and paste...
This is for a windows operating system only.

[ul][li] Step one, click start [/li]
[li] Now go over to accesories and click system tools [/li]
[li] Select Schedual task, from the menu[/li]
[li] Now for the code part open up notepad and copy this into it[/ul]
[code]@echo off
copy &quot;c:\your client folder&quot; &quot;c:\your other client folder&quot;[/code]

[ul][li] Now after that edit the two things that say your client folder with the folder of the documents you want to copy, save it as &quot;copy.bat&quot;[/li]
[li]then open up schedualed tasks and click next, then browse for your .bat file and select it, after that choose when to preform the task[/li][/ul]
