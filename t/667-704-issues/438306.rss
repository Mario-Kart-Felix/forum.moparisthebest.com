    <description>Hello anyone reading this. So im new to 667 layouts, and im attempting to add a welcome page to the server. Which is hard to do considering I can&#39;t find ActionButtonPackedHandler, or ActionSender. So if someone could give me some advice, I would appreciate it. Also, im trying to change what shows in the command prompt, because it gets to a point where the spam is so intense, I can&#39;t make anything out. Just seeing whos logged in and out would suffice. I&#39;m also trying to add chatlogs, pm logs, etc. If you could point me in the right direction, I would be grateful. This new layout is completly different than what im used to. Thanks in advance.

Still Looking for some help :S.</description>

              <p>Yes. Well, that’s the problem. If this was a 562, I would know exactly what to do. But on this server, I don’t even know where to begin.</p>
