    <description>Hey, guys my name is Dana Garcia, I&#39;m looking for some serious coders to start coding on Project G/E. This project is a server i&#39;m making with a fully functional Grand Exchange. I have tons of code already that will give a functional Grand Exchange.

If you interested in joining let me know.

Team members requested skills(At least of of the following):
Interface skills:
Can create and edit a interface for any rsps client.
Can take logical data and display it into a visible repersentation for the user.

PHP Web Interface skills:
Can create and edit a web browser accessable page that displays all current Grand Exchange Offers.
Can take logical data and display it into a visible repersentation for the user.

Coding skills(minimum):
Can design custom methods that interlace with any server &quot;with a little modification&quot;.


About the project:
1. This project with use code that the team will create custom to make a fully functional Grand Exchange.
2. The Grand Exchange will have a interface to match runescapes current Grand Exchange.
3. The Grand Exchange will also have all the features of runescapes current Grand Exchange.
4. The PHP Grand Exchange will display data from all sales on any particular item in a graph.

1* The code is pretty much already created all that needs to be done is the interface and php.
     Seeing as I am by no means a php or graphic artist I cannont complete the task.
     If you are willing to work with me to integrate my code with either you artwork,code,php code.
     I would love to have you on the team.
2* An interface create is a must have for the project with out this person the project will never meet its
    100% mark.
3* I can handle this part with ease. All of the code is readily avialable.
4* This is also a must have for the grand exchange to people can see what to offer and what to sell for.</description>
