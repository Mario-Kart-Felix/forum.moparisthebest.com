MICHAEL THE EMO BEAR<br>
Michael died on June 6, 2006 from slitting his wrists after a good cry in his walk-in closet.<br>
You see, Michael was depressed for no apparent reason, besides his obsession with stupid pop-emo/screamo<br>
bands like “My Chemical Romance”, “Atreyu”, and “Silverstein”.He had become so obsessed with these bands<br>
that he began to think that you had to be emo to fit in. This delusion had been created by the combination<br>
of the music he listened to, the recent murder of his steady girlfriend, his best friend (an emo squirrel)<br>
and his incurable problem, bipolarity. He became emo slowly so his parents would hardly notice the difference,<br>
but they wouldn’t have, because they were apathetic and alcoholic. Had they been sober at least 4 hours a day,<br>
perhaps they would have saved Michael from the evil plague of emoism. But I can’t describe his life this<br>
way. He would eat me if I did. So here’s Michael’s story, from the perspective of his best friend, Roger.</p>
<pre><code>Michael was 9 years old when I met him. We didn't have much in common, except for us living in the
</code></pre>
<p>forest together, and we were on the same food chain. We were an odd pair, and we couldn’t play on the same<br>
playgrounds, but that didn’t matter to us. We quickly became inseparable, even though he would try to eat me<br>
when he was very hungry and his mother was making lasagna or the like. As we grew up, I introduced him to<br>
things like emo music, and “scene” clothes. I had fully evolved into my emo state by the time I was 15, but<br>
Michael was a bit slower. It took him til he was 17, and it was a slow change. But it happened, and he was<br>
made into a martyr when he commited suicide.</p>
<pre><code>Michael's girlfriend was named Edea, an emo to a nearly impossible extremity. She had scars all over
</code></pre>
<p>her arms, as the skin on her wrists had hardened after she had cut it so many times. But she was afraid of<br>
death, and always stopped the bleeding when she felt she would pass out. However, on the eve of her 19th<br>
birthday, she was walking to my house when she was confronted by a man in what appeared to be a mental<br>
hospital outfit. Indeed, his clothing read “5051” when the light shone on it, letting Edea know that she<br>
was dealing with a psycho. He pulled a knife and quietly said, “Die, die, die, my darling…” Edea screamed,<br>
“OMG!!! You’re a Misfits fan! So am I!” The man replied, “No, I was singing the Metallica cover of the song.<br>
The Misfits are awesome too. I especially like Teenagers From Mars. Now take this blade in your stomach!”<br>
Edea gave a soft moan as the man shoved a knife into her stomach exactly 94 times. He then cut her wrists,<br>
as he believed it would make it appear she had commited suicide. When Edea didn’t arrive after 2 hours,<br>
Michael panicked and ran out to the streets, only to find his dead girlfriend lying on the pavement.<br>
“Oh noes!!!”, he cried in anguish, “My girl has been murderz0red!” Crying, he ran home and ran straight to his<br>
closet, with me in hot pursuit. He began crying, and continued for about 2 hours. I even cried with him, for<br>
good measure. He then told me in a soft voice, “Go get me a sharp razor…” I did as he said, and came quickly<br>
back.</p>
<pre><code>He began cutting his non-existent bear wrists. Cut, cut, cut, the razor swiped in almost perfect time
</code></pre>
<p>with the Silverstein music that played in the background. Michael was getting frantic, as he couldn’t find his<br>
wrists. Eventually he found them, and the razor sliced the veins like they were nothing. Blood shot everywhere,<br>
and he quickly was dying. “Ummm…should I call a paramedic?”, I asked timidly. “NO!!”, he yelled, “I’m gonna<br>
die tonight!” And indeed, three minutes later, his heart stopped pumping, and he had ceased to live. I picked<br>
up his razor and began to cut all of his fur off, for no reason that I could think of. I died too that night…<br>
but emotionally, not physically like Michael and Edea. I softly said at his funeral, “The end…”</p>
