<p>Are we texting?  No.  There’s a full keyboard right in front of you, so if you’re to lazy to type out a full word, I can’t even imagine what a jog around the block feels like to you.  And I’ve been at parties all weeked, now it’s 8pm on a sunday night and I have school tommorow.  Obviously i’m not going to be at a party right now.  I don’t smoke weed because you know, it’s illegal and stupid.  I plan to do something with my life, not get ass-raped in jail.  Good luck with your life asshole.</p>

<p>You’re graduating from what? Elementary?  I’m pretty sure if you had the IQ of a 2nd grader you should know that there is only one period after every sentence and ‘ur’ isn’t a word.  I have a girlfriend, and I have a social life.  You’re asking who cares about grammar?  I’m pretty sure every employer on this planet care about grammar, unless you’re going to be a garbage man.  And one last thing, calling someone a ‘kid’ doesn’t make you an adult.  Now L2Grammar before you respond.</p>

You can’t just learn java through a teamviewer session.  I reccomend searching for Mendomorphin’s RSPS tools.  Downloading that and looking through the files until you find a Word Document called ‘Basic Coding’, or something like that.  It teaches you what everything is called and what they do.</p>

              <p>Ok so im new to java and i thought it would be cool to have my own rsps. But the thing is i can’t seem to get anything going for me. i’ve tried guides and everything… but it just isn’t helping a bit. So could someone please help me via Team Viewer?  ;D</p>
