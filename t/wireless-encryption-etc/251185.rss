    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wireless-encryption-etc/251185</link>
    <description>I haven&#39;t been using it for a few months now, because I&#39;d rather use the &#39;New stations are not allowed&#39;; feature for many reasons. Just annoys me trying to connect with different devices and not being let in because of the wrong key, when I can simply allow it from my PC.

Does this encryption encrypt my transfers or does it just encrypt access to the network. Nobody can get on it, I&#39;m just wondering if somebody could intercept packets and get my paypal password...</description>

Alright then. I don’t normally use my linux boot so is there a way to do it in windows easily? With my shitty free bt router?</p>
<p>I suppose I could just use linux if I’m doing something important (boots in seconds :P) so can I have your script? :D[/quote]</p>
<p>In windows you can use Putty to set up the socks5 proxy through an ssh server.  Google for a tutorial.</p>
<p>Here is my script, with personal details removed (if you wonder why I keep trying, it’s because when you connect wirelessly you obviously have to set up the connection to the router before you can ssh into a server):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">#!/bin/sh
killall ssh;
killall ssh;
echo "starting";
while true; do
	# make sure you use an IP instead of a domain if you don't want to do a DNS lookup in the open
        # also, if you run this automatically you have to set up ssh to not require a password, google that as well
	ssh -fND localhost:1080 user@ip &gt; /dev/null 2&gt; /dev/null;
	if [ -n "$(netstat -na | grep "LISTEN" | grep ":1080")" ]
	then
		break;
	fi
	echo "failed";
	sleep 5;
done
echo "success";
</code></pre>

<p>My sister connects to the router, and shes right next door, about 10 feet? if you walk from the router to inside her room, and she gets poor reception. There is a wall exactly where her computer is(On the other side),  a door, another door, and she connects the adapter to the front of the computer so the legs block the signal.(excluding the digital devices from here to her room). And about across the street, 20 meters away, a friend of mines get perfect reception. So he objects in the way play a part too.</p>
<p>If the poor connection to your other room upstairs is a problem, i forget the name of the router, but it sends the signal everywhere(multi directional?), instead of 1 way.</p>

<p>Actually, the room next to me gets average reception and it’s very low anywhere downstairs so I’m pretty much safe from random people… Can’t believe I never thought about that.</p>

              <p>Secure sites that use SSL should be secure even over an unsecured network.  Wireless encryption actually restricts access and encrypts the data you send, problem is most encryption mechanisms are very easily cracked.  Someone with the right card and one of many sniffing/cracking programs that abound for free on the internet can have access to your network within a few minutes.</p>
<p>If you really want the packets you send flying through the air to be truly safe, do what I do.  Route all of your traffic through SSH to your router (assuming your router has an ssh daemon running, if not any server that you can log into with ssh will work).  This is much easier than you would think, with the proper command ssh can start up a socks5 proxy on your local machine.  Set your browser to use that as your proxy, and your traffic is automatically encrypted with the uncrackable (unless you are the NSA) SSL encryption and perfectly safe in between your computer and wherever you had ssh connect to.</p>
<p>I have a script written for linux that runs every time I log in to automatically set up this connection for you that I can post later when I’m on my laptop if anyone is interested.</p>
