    <description>Does Anybody have Team Viewer, or No how to use, to get my Server up and Running?
I&#39;m stuck.

How we can do it, Please give me your MSN ill add you, and please help me.

Team Viewer is a Small program (very low download) that alloud you to view you partners desktop, that way they can accsess your desktop and help get my server up and running.

For the people that think this is a easy way to hack my computer, I can see where you move the mouse, so if yo like try to delete somthing i can just move the mouse away, and talk to on msn, simple.</description>

              <p>umm no this is a common error that happens sometimes what it is, is that they ping your server, When the do this some servers have built in where they cant be pinged other times its your firewall blocking the ping but i wouldn’t worry about that anyway manual advertisement is always the best way.</p>

dont worry about my pm, But if its not a problem, could you go thrugh team view quickly to see if its all right like check u torrent, cos u torrent says an error when the server is running, since 2 ports (43594) is running.</p>

              <p>Lol. Don’t really worry about that atm if you can connect maybe get one of your friends to try and connect because what that site does is ping your server and if you have a client needed server than most likely it will not work or if your firewall is on it can cause that to happen as well.</p>

              <p>loved it is easy for you to start your server without teamviewer hit the run button in the server file. Then open up the client folder and click gui make sure that there is no no-ip server ips in there if there is one replace it with localhost this will allow you to connect to your server after that hit save compile and run in te client folder. This will turn your client on and allow you to login to server without problems. If you haven’t portfoward just portfoward than do that</p>
