Im using interuppted 508/525 source and it has a captain barnabay tele you around places. Im trying to make another one of those but i cant figure out how. I figured out where you make the npc dialouge and how you make it tele. (npc option1 for dialouge and optionclicking for teles) only thing i cant figure out is how to pick the npc. Any help? And i also can&#39;t seem to get the interface to appear. That might be same thing but idk. =( Ill rep if you help</description>
