RuneAzura 718 is a brand new addition too the RuneAzura team. We currently have two servers as of last week, RuneAzura 317 was our original project and has been up for just under a year, with continuous updates. The RuneAzura team slowly came too the conclusion, &quot;why not expand our services for the majority of Rsps players?&quot; Therefore, we thought a great 718 would do just the trick bringing out all the new 718 features and content that we can not explore on the 317.
