              <p>well first u go to <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a> then u have to read teh rules, and put yes. in the box. and then u’ll have to download it. then u make any username and pass u want, go to server status and find a server. put the server ip in the place. and then the server port might not always be the same. if it’s 43594 for the server then don’t do anything with it. if it’s not then go to file at the top left. and hit port thing lol. and put the port num they give u. hope this helped. if it did plz say so. if it didnt tell me what problems ur having and i’ll try to help u as much as i can.</p>
