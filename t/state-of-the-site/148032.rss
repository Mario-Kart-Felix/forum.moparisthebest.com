    <title>State of the... site?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/state-of-the-site/148032</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not in much of a mood for fancy writing to sway your minds, so I&#39;ll be short and as to the point as I get. moparisthebest presides over this website and arguably the RS cheating scene. Therefore, as something of a president, I think he should be required to give an address on the current state of things pertaining to this website. Anyone with me?</description>

no. progress does not happen at <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> either. if they had progress they wouldnt need a application to restart their servers every 10 minutes. Fact is when you put the words runescape and programming together, you get Trash.</p>
