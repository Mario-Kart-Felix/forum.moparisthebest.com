    <title>Macintosh Server Running (Staying On and Auto Server Reboot)</title>

    <description>Hello!

I have had difficulty keeping my 317 server hosting on my MacBook without shutting down in an hour (if even that lucky).  For a couple months, a person with a horrible Windows XP Desktop, that had about 4 GB Harddrive space left, hosted it. Even that caused shut downs after a few hours; though, that was expected.  

I have a splendid Macintosh Desktop with 2.26Ghz, 4 GB Ram, and 1.07 Ghz Bus Speed (it needs to be upgraded to Snow Leopard to even host, so I have not tested it yet).  I am willing to host a server 24/7 but this is where I need your help...how do I keep it running? If it&#39;s a desktop, does it tend to run more hours than a laptop?  Assuming it won&#39;t continuously run, do any of you have a Terminal shell file that reboots the server every few hours like a &quot;voule.bat?&quot; Do you have advice or methods to keep it running?

If you need my server info to help me out, here&#39;s my server:

Thank You!
