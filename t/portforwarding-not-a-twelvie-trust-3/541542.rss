    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/portforwarding-not-a-twelvie-trust-3/541542</link>
    <description>I have a Thomson TG585 V7, I cannot port forward I have tried everything called my ISP (Telecom) they couldn&#39;t do anything except tell me to call my modem company I call them and they say &quot;sorry we don&#39;t help with that.&quot;. This is so frustrating, I need this so I can host a simple website for a school project.. is there anyway I can possibly do it. I have followed tutorials on port forward.com i&#39;ve spent the past 6 hours googleing it pleasee help &lt;3 I was told it may have something to do with pin hole in my firewall? I will cry if anyone can help.. you don&#39;t understand :((( Thank you so much if there is any more info you need just ask also my skype is booga464 if you really want to help xo I know you guys used to get this a lot but I actually have tried everything possible. I have a dynamic IP I don&#39;t know if that has anything to do with it, I called my ISP and they wanted $20 for a static if I need to get one I will.</description>

              <p>Which port are you trying to port-forward? Some tips for port-forwarding:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you can’t get it to work by simply adding the port to the router port-forwarding page, try disabling firewall on computer and router.</li>
<li>Make sure it’s pointed towards your local IPv4 address (start &gt; run… &gt; ‘cmd’ &gt; ‘ipconfig’ - To find it)</li>
<li>Make sure the application (I’m assuming an RSPS) is listening on the port you’re trying to forward. Also, make sure the client is listening to your IP address. (<a href="http://www.whatsmyip.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.whatsmyip.org/</a> : this is different than your local IPv4 address, this is your external IP or router’s IP.)</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll want to try and avoid using a masking software like No-IP, just adds an extra (and pointless) step in the connection.</p>

              <p>Ended up doing it, turn your firewall of both router and antivirus.

Are you trying to port forward port 80? Since you have Skype, Skype listens for incoming connections on port 80 and 443. Exit Skype and try again.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Alternatively, you can route skype off of port 80/443 instead of exiting the app. That’s what I did since I like to localhost on XAMPP/WAMP and skype…</p>
<p>How big is the project (I might be able to share some space on one of my websites)?</p>
<p>Have you considered one of the millions of free webhosts?[/quote]<br>
It’s just a small project for year 11 nothing big I just wanted to host it for some friends and teachers.</p>

<p>About the static IP bit, set up a dynamic DNS, for example No-ip <a href="http://www.noip.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.noip.com/</a>, that will solve that problem.</p>

<p>I’ll be sure to give this ago but tbh I don’t think it has to do with that. I’ve also tryed portforwarding a server same problem <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> I tryed it with another modem same problem… Does anyone know how to make a pin hole through your firewall I heard that may fix it</p>
