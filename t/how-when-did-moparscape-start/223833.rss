    <title>How &amp; When did MoparScape start?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-when-did-moparscape-start/223833</link>
    <description>Hey...I was thinking earlier how &amp; when MoparScape started? Because it is very interesting how MoparScape used to look like the old RuneScape. I figured that an Ex-Staff member of Jagex released the RuneScape files, but then I thought about it again, and said that there&#39;s no way that could have happened...So how exactly did the staff of MoparScape get MoparScape to look exactly like the old RuneScape? And when did MoparScape start?</description>

              <p>Runescape emulation didn’t start when winterLove wrote Blakescape… o.0</p>
<p>Before Blake wrote his server with daiki, people had them, way before: RSC servers are a prime example. Blake chose 317 (It was the newest at the time) to be his arbitrary version and refactored the obfuscated JaGex client. He then wrote the first version which only handled the login and simple walking protocol. Version 2 saw multiplayer addition, and Version 3 had items, walking, talking, multiplayer.</p>
<p>He then released his server publicly, being the first person to publicly release a Runescape 2 private emulator.</p>
