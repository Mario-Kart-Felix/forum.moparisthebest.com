[*]Developer
















[B]Welcome to Wilderness.[/B]
The goal of Wilderness is to create an nearly perfect PK server,
just like the old runescape from 2006-2008. While achieving perfect pking,
we will still try to have a balanced economy for fun gameplay.
An example of this would be, if you were PKing and the other player had a whip,
and you killed him for it, you would actually get excited because it means something,
and has a price. By this I mean you&#39;d actually have to kill quite a 
few Abyssal Demons before you actually get a whip, or skill non-stop 
to create money for it. The next part of this, is the feeling of the old 
runescape wilderness. No overpowered bullshit, I don&#39;t want to 
have dragon claws or any of those over-powered weapons. The only newer items
i&#39;d implement are maybe shields, because I believe 317 runescape 
doesn&#39;t have enough decent shields. You would only see 
Dragon-fire shields, Spirit shields, and Helm of neitiznot as the newer items.
That&#39;s pretty much the main idea of it, and since 
I have nothing else I can think of right now to write here, let&#39;s continue.






We need a programmer soon, so please don&#39;t hesitate to apply.
Post here or PM me if you wish to apply privately.[/center]</description>
