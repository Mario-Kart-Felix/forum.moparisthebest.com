    <title>[Cell Phone] Cheaper Plan</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cell-phone-cheaper-plan/552809</link>
    <description>Right now I am with Verizon and still under contract (so I need a company that will buy me out of my contract)
Plan Features:
- Unlimited Talk
- Unlimited Txt
- 2Gb data

Current bill: $70/mo


Does anyone know a cheaper alternative without sacrificing features?</description>

In a major city or more rural? Your plan is going to be very hard to beat without jumping to a carrier like Straight Talk that runs on someone else’s network. T-Mobile and Sprint are the only ones to buy you out of a contract, but both don’t have nearly the same coverage unless its a major city.</p>
<p>T-Mobile is $60/mo for the same plan as yours, but they don’t do subsidized phones. You’ll either have to buy it at full price, or do it on a 24-month installment plan which is around $25-35/mo for top tier phones. They don’t charge you for data overages, so you will get 2gb at 4G LTE speeds, and anything after that is throttled to 2g speeds.</p>
<p>Should also note how the contract buyout works. You will still have to front the early termination fee, and bring your new carrier a copy of the final bill. They will process it and send you a prepaid Amex or Visa within a few weeks.</p>
