    <title>Ubuntu Dual Boot Installation Error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ubuntu-dual-boot-installation-error/158896</link>
    <description>Hello. I was reinstalling Ubuntu as a dual boot with XP [this time 7.10... I found it is a bad idea to install them on Compac nc6000 series afterwards...] using this tutorial http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=28948 [first time with this tutorial]. Part way through install, I got to a part asking me to pick which software to install... and no matter what software I picked, it always gave an error and made me restart that step. I decided to just install Ubuntu Desktop and it stuck itself at 6 percent. I thought I could just restart, but when I did, I got an error message saying &quot;Error Loading Operating System&quot;. I am using the computer right now with a Knoppix LiveDVD and I can access both partitions. I will back up my files soon, but I would like to know what I should do to fix this.
Thanks,
Justis
Note: This is now fixed, installing ubuntu fixed it all.</description>

              <p>Well, I tried BOOTCFG, but I shall try your fix… but I also found my old 7.04 Ubuntu install disk and am at 54% right now, would that affect the fix?</p>

              <p>do you still have your windows xp cd?<br>
if you  want to use only XP, try these steps:<br>
boot from the cd, then go to the recovery console(i believe by pressing f6)<br>
it will then ask you to select your installation of windows(if you have only one installed, i think it wont ask)<br>
after that, you’ll have to login to the admin account<br>
do so, and you will get to a command line<br>
in here, type “fixmbr” without the quotes, and press enter<br>
when it’s done, try rebooting, it should bring you back to windows</p>
