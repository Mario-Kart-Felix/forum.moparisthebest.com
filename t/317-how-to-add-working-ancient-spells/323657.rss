    <title>[317] How to add working ancient spells?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-how-to-add-working-ancient-spells/323657</link>
    <description>I recently coded this blank source, but there was a problem. No ancient spells. Whenever I try and use Ice Barrage on a player or npc, it disconnects me? So, how do you add working barrage, blitz, etc? Help is appreciated :)
EDIT::: my friend told me you needed a packet? Where can I get it and how do I put it on the source?</description>
