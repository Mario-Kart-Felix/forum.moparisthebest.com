              <p>let me get this straight… Lets pretend by your stated above logic that all over the web templates are similar to mine correct? So you want me to impress people by taking a extra 300 hundred hours to make something special. How about this. You show me a website you made without any CMS, has to be PHP based as mine is. (making it fair) and create a template, you will realize it is no easy task. ( btw a template is like outline of the site, CSS is where it gets designed to become something great) (I also stated to you in a PM that i didnt mean to show off and that this website is only like a 2 day project, and that i was sorry if i upset you while taking to coon, you want something special, pay for it, and any web designer knows content is better then design, the design is only there to “Buy” you.)</p>
<p>This will be my last reply to you on this board unless you post a picture of “YOUR” website.</p>
<p>By the way, the conversation was between me &amp; coonhunter. I guess i should of PM him instead of leaving it open for everyone to read and fight against.</p>
<p>Although i must thank you. Your reply did not include “Noob,idiot,fag,queer” you actually pointed out something and it was not general, Not only that but you did not use lower class grammar. Also you did not make fun of my Website you just stated it was Basic. Nothing to show off, for that i respect you.</p>
<p>P.S:</p>
<p>I was trying to make it basic, I did not want people to think i was selling something, and just click away. Plus with any complex PHP website, loading is always a problem. I had to find a medium.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>templates like that can be seen all over the web. nothing special. looks boring actually.</p>
<p>doubt you got a template that can impress anyone here, but certainly keep trying.</p>

Last time I said “cache version” I was corrected and told that there’s no version to a cache, so I’m just going to say client version.[/quote]<br>
It’s cache though. It reads through the client and can be changed via client. Like I could make my client think it was a version 100435 but it still have 317 cache.</p>

<p>Personally, the basic-ness of this site is what draws me.  It proves that such little things can go a long way.  This <span class="bbcode-s">community</span> site has a lot to offer, from just the most basic of things.  Plus with little <span class="bbcode-s">shits</span> kids like you, why waste the time to jazz it up?</p>

<p>No offense dude, but you are a noob. If you were coding mopar before it was “famous” then you would know what those numbers ment. I first found out about this site about 4 years ago but never signed up until last year. Just to get my first account muted and banned. It took me about 10 minutes to realise what those numbers ment. So i dont see the troubles a “before it was famous” type of coder like yourself would have.</p>

The number represents the client version.<br>

cache version.[/quote]<br>
Last time I said “cache version” I was corrected and told that there’s no version to a cache, so I’m just going to say client version.</p>
