    <title>Which topic interests you the most and why</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-topic-interests-you-the-most-and-why/553901</link>
    <description>I have to write a paper about one of the following topics, which one would you pick and why?

* ERP
* Software defined networks
* Trends in IT infrastructure
[b]* Containers (and Docker)[/b]
* Big data analytics
* iOS development
[b]* Microservices architecture[/b]
* The internet of things
* We are makers (3d printing, iot, crowd sourcing, ..)
* Hands-on mobile development
* Ethical hacking

I&#39;m doubting between the two topics in bold: Containers (and Docker) and Microservices architecture.
Both of these seem useful in the near future.

I do like the internet of things and we are makers, but those seem tedious to write a paper about.
Hands-on mobile development treats cross platform app development (web vs native vs xamarin vs ...?)</description>

              <p>Personally, ‘Ethical Hacking’ interests me the most, but only because it’s something I already have an interest in. What class is the paper for, I think it makes a difference - for example if I was writing an ‘Ethical Hacking’ paper the only interesting angle I can think of is a more sociological/perhaps business-impacty type angle, whereas if its supposed to be a techical paper the SOA or big data ones might be a better choice.</p>

Ethical Hacking also interests me a lot, but I don’t think I’ll be much with this when I’m searching for a job later (a non hacker job), or am I wrong?</p>

<p>Also something that interests me, but isn’t it stupid to make a paper on it? Imo IoT is something to do, not to write a paper on, not?</p>
