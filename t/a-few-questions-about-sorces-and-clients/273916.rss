Hi there, Try taking a look in the <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,49.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Server Download Section</a> and for the shops it depends on the source, it can be 999m or 2147m, anyways look at the <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,49.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Server Download Section</a>, for a good client, source.</p>
<p>and for the pages, yes but it would have to be coded.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I have tried looking all over and i cannot find what im looking for, as for the shop questions, you did not answer my first one, you only gave me prices.</p>
<p>But thanks.[/quote]Do you mean how much items can fit in a shop?</p>
