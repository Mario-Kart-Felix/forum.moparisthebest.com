    <description>ok so ive already got everything done on my server, ive got it portwarded and ive got my firewall accepeting that port. however im having quite a grief getting it up, ive jarrd it and signed it and tryed to download it from a different computer (my neighbors) and it wouldnt connect (yes i had it running). i did that as a test to check it so i didnt realy expect it to, so i rooted around in my client folder and i changed the ip (after i spent sometime singing up with no-ip.com) so i jarrd it and tried it and it still didnt work. when i downloaded it at my neighbors house the client just stayed at 0 and i restarted it plenty of times, , now im wondering if i have to changed an ip in my source inorder for their client connect to my loader. the problem is i cant find that ip or anything like it (im using rune-evo 728 with matrix 718 client) Can someone please help me ? thanks</description>

<p>That’s why I said don’t try and use your no-ip for now. Just plug in your regular IP from <a href="http://whatismyip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">whatismyip.com</a> into all the spots that require it in Loader.java.

<p>now when i compile my client its fine, but when i run it wont load and gives me this error <code>java.net.MalformedURLException: no protocol: 108.181.171.21108.181.171.21

<p>Make sure you’re NO-IP is setup correctly. Keep trying it with your normal IP so you have less variables to mess up. Perhaps you are not compiling the client correctly? And the server has to be running for the client to load, in case you didn’t know that (it’s just for higher revision servers).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I thought at first because of it being a matrix client and when you compile it gives you 14 warnings, i thought that was the problem, but it dosnt seem to be. for no-ip duc would i use my ip (my basic ip) or would i use either my ipv4 adress or my gateway ip? Lol this is almost starting to make me wanna punch kittens.</p>

<p>Sure I’ll do my best to help[/quote]<br>
kk so i didnt have to turn off my firewall, its currently accepting connections from port 43594 (according to <a href="http://canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.org</a>, and i did add that port to my firewall so it should accept it) But when i jarr and sign my client, upload it to mediafire and try to download it for some reason the client wont load past 0, i even check everywhere in my client folder to see if i missed any ips wich i did, i changed that ip to my no-ip (even if i put my actual ip it wouldnt make a difference it would still give me this error)  and then i put that link on med fire and it still wont connect. im almost wondering if <a href="http://canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.org</a> can test your port and succeed even if your firewall wont accept those connections? oh geez im in a mess <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
