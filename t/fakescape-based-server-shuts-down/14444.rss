    <title>Fakescape based server shuts down</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fakescape-based-server-shuts-down/14444</link>
    <description>My Fakescape based server shuts itself down about every 20 minutes, sometimes more often, and it&#39;ll get errors, which change depending on the time.

How can I fix this? Can somebody help me?
I have msn messenger, and gmail chat.
I can also talk in-game.

I have set up a scheduled task that runs every 20 minutes to end the server, and restart it, but it doesn&#39;t work so well, on times when the server stops working in like 2 minutes.

Thanks for your help!</description>
