    <title>Parenting, what are your views on it?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/parenting-what-are-your-views-on-it/437136</link>
    <description>Everyone thinks they would be a good parent, so I&#39;m asking you what your views on parenting are and what concepts you will/would adopt when having a child? I am interested to see peoples ideals.

              <p>I believe children should be smacked when they do wrong and the reason is simple, it’s not about building respect by doing that it’s about teaching a child what is wrong, sure if you want to try and reason with a kid then be my guest, however those few minutes of sudden pain that are associated with doing something wrong are rncoursgements not to do it again, it’s conditioning not to do certain things for fear of punishment it has nothing to do respect. Earning respect with your children comes from interacting with them throughout their life. As Mpman said I was smacked as a child to and it didn’t do me any harm, I feel it made me a more well rounded person tbf</p>

True. However fresh organic ingredients without preservatives and all the added junk is definitely more expensive than processed foods. Not obscenely so, but still more expensive.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t think the preservatives and other junk are that much of a factor. What Americans need is a low calorie, high exercise diet. They eat larger than normal (normal in the US) portions and barely excercise.[/quote]<br>
Some. Id say we have alot of body builders and fitness junkies and anorexics than we do fat people. And the statistic is “overweight” which can as little as 10 pounds. Not everyone here looks obese but a gut is common ish. We don’t really have a middle ground. Youre either really skinny, gut-fat, or fit/toned/built.</p>

<p>It might be true, but wouldn’t be better to increase the tax on unhealthy food and not fine people?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Both boil down to the same thing. You either fine people who are too fat, hoping they will eat healthy food, or you increase tax on unhealthy food, hoping people will eat healthy food instead. But when is someone fat? What food is healthy? Is all low fat food healthy, or only organically grown food? Lobby groups will have fun changing the definitions of these terms.[/quote]<br>
We don’t tax anything based on what it contains. If you know how to eat it in moderation then you’re fine. Fat isnt all that bad for you, but it can build up fast and become detrimental to your health. Im not overweight and im not underweight, I eat a fuckton of junk but I also love eating salads and actual meals, and I also exercise regularly.</p>
<p>If they start young we wouldn’t have these bullshit shows like “the biggest loser” and crybabies on dr phil.</p>
<p>Of course im excluding thyroid issues</p>

              <p>Being a parent for 5 weeks doesn’t make me an expert, but I have noticed little things with our daughter. I swear, she can feel when I’m angry or frustrated and that makes her cry like crazy so I try to stay calm and happy around her. I remember being spanked once by my father, I don’t remember what I did, but I never did anything to be spanked again because I was afraid of him. I don’t want my kids to be afraid that we will hurt them, so I do not believe in spanking. I would hope that raising them as best we can will help them make good choices.</p>
<p>Now, if one of them intentionally did something really bad or hurt someone, I would have to reconsider.</p>
