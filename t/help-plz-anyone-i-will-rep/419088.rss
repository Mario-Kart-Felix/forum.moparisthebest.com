    <title>Help! Plz Anyone!? :( I will rep++</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-plz-anyone-i-will-rep/419088</link>
    <description>I am using ProjectDungeon fest and i downloaded the cache and i dont know where to extract it to i have .rspscache, .rspscache2, .rspscache3 in my users file and i dont know which client to use. When i change the settings at clientsetting.java it gives me error downloading. I compiled them. I moved the cache from the folder to folder. It still gives me errors.. There is a cache downloading link in the clientsetting.java, do i need to upload the cache into the internet? or somehow remove the auto-cache downloader? The link for project dungeon fest cache downloader page is broken which is http://armadyll.info/alex/cache2.zip, http://127.0.0.1/cache.zip doesn&#39;t work i would appreciate if someone help me with telling me what to do. Thx.

Note: Newer caches creates glitches in the source and i can&#39;t combine them. Changing caches don&#39;t help. i want to use this cache http://www.megaupload.com/?d=T499RE54

Yeah I&#39;m gonna explain to it more to them for them to see it more clearly, it&#39;s just for people to see it more clearly:

go into clientsetting.java just like austin said, you should have a code pop up like this:
Code (): [Select]
        public static final String ip = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;;
        public static final int port = 43594;
        public static final String background_music_name = &quot;Scape Original&quot;; //rs classic music &lt;3
        public static final String serverName = &quot;Project DungeonFest&quot;; //server name, also auto changes client title and load bar
        public static final String websiteLink = &quot;http://alex.rspscoding.org&quot;; //so it goes ur website instead of rs, example on acc creation terms service button
        public static final Color startLoadClientBackgroundColor = Color.black; //Color.black default
        public static final boolean disable_server_list = false; //dont disable this , ofc you may but then serverlist doesnt work anymore
        public static final boolean disable_ukeys_check = true; //containers table information check but ppl give weird names for stuff as: &quot;ukeys&quot;
        public static final boolean disable_keys_request = true; //if this true, disable_ukeys_check has to be true too, when this true, you can load client without connecting server

change the ip to whatever you need.

Now to fix the cache downloader (may not work)
now try to find this code for the cache:

Code: [Select]
public static final String cacheLink = &quot;http://armadyll.info/alex/cache2.zip

Replace with this:
Code: [Select]
public static final String cacheLink = &quot;http://www485.megaupload.com/files/8d0a5a51a04993491d096b6b552da810/cache.zip

If that doesn&#39;t work use this dl:
http://www.megaupload.com/?d=T499RE54

Then extract it to C: and replace the link with this:


guide doesn&#39;t help as well... Anyone help? 
 
Later on i received this

[quote=&quot;xJavac, post:3, topic:418986&quot;]2 things. First; I&#39;ve been ignoring this for awhile because other players have been saying this, but why do you keep making so many topics.. You&#39;re post are literally everywhere.

2.) If you can&#39;t even configure the Cache loading path, and also set-up the Cache that you have too a .rar, and change the link host too 127.0.0.1/cache.zip , then go too 317&#39;s. I hate when people say that personally, but that is the only place you might have a chance too start Developing with. Because Coding rs2hd takes more skill then setting up the Cache path.

Download the Cache, move the WHOLE .RAR into your C:\ , run the Client, it will extract the Cache for you.
Second, (&quot;user.home&quot;) is where your Windows User Account is (or whatever OS your using.). So say you made your account name, &quot;Javac&quot;, it would be C:\Users\Javac\cache\. Download that cache file and move it too your C:\.

Replace your string where it gets the cache with this.
[code]public static String getCacheDir() {
		return System.getProperty(&quot;user.home&quot;) + &quot;/cache&quot;; // loads the cache from this directory.
	}[/code]

Replace where it says armadyll.info, just replace that whole thing with 
[code]public static final String cacheLink = &quot;http://127.0.0.1/cache.zip&quot;; //make sure it zip[/code]

Coz god forbid i tell you how too set the link and you get 100 errors. =.=&quot;. Now, I repeat, DO NOT Extract the cache, after the cache is done downloaded and you move it too &quot;C:\&quot;, it will Auto-Extract the Cache WHEN YOU RUN THE CLIENT. So basically after you place the cache in your C:\, Run the Client. I think the rest is explanatory from there.[/quote]

I tried that and i got this

I did what u said. I moved the http://www.megaupload.com/?d=T499RE54 cache into /C. I changed the client settings

[code]
public static String getCacheDir() {
                return System.getProperty(&quot;user.home&quot;) + &quot;/cache&quot;; // loads the cache from this directory.
        }
[/code]

[code]
public static final String cacheLink = &quot;http://127.0.0.1/cache.zip&quot;; //make sure it zip
[/code]

I compiled them. Then i get this error.
