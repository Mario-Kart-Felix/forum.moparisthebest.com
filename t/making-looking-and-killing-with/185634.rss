    <description>I wanted to make an item, create NPC&#39;s and make them look like i designed them.
And i was just wondering....how do you do that?
miss silab made a halo version server with energy swords i want to make halo guns :P
and make people look like master chief(his armor).
i want to know what kind of software I would need?
if anyone knows the software to make and create your own item&#39;s please post.</description>
