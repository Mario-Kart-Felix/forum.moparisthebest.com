    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-ruducing-lag/355780</link>
    <description>hi i downloaded a client earlier and its what i have been looking for for ages, the only problem is it is laggy, not loads but its laggy and its getting kinda annoying, i dont think its my computer cause i have a decent grafics card and 3gb of ram with a dual core 2.88 ghz processor.

ive heard of an anti-lag program or code????

im pretty new to coding so i have no idea what this program or code is and how to add or innitalize it, if someone could help me i would appreciate it :)

thanks guys :)

P.S sorry about the spelling, i know i suck Lool</description>
