    <title>Hurricane Ike in Ohio</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hurricane-ike-in-ohio/231732</link>
    <description>If you are wondering why I haven&#39;t been online since early Sunday morning, it is because winds from hurricane Ike knocked out all the power about 3pm Sunday, and I still don&#39;t have electricity on Thursday.  I am posting this from school since this has been the first internet access I have gotten since then.

In addition to knocking out power, it ripped all the shingles off the roof of my apartment, a sheet of flying plexi-glass came within inches of killing my brother but I pulled him out of the way without a second to spare, and a huge limb put a hand sized dent in the roof of my show truck at my parents house :(

Since then I have driven 30 miles one way to acquire a small charcoal grill, which we have heated up pizza, grilled steaks, mozzarella sticks, pizza rolls, eggs, sausage and anything else left in our thawing freezer before it went bad.  Now we are reduced to eating lunchmeat (which we must go buy right before we eat and then eat all of it), drinking warm soda and taking freezing cold showers.  To pass the time we play Monopoly, Uno and Trouble by candlelight before we go to bed.  Also the schoolwork that doesn&#39;t have to be done on the computer is done by candlelight, which is fairly hard to do and leaves you with a headache.

Our power is supposed to be back on by Saturday, but It might not be till mid next week, so when it is back I&#39;ll be back.  Still I feel lucky because many others got it far worse than me, like all the people that lost their homes in Texas, and the father and daughter 5 miles from my home whom a tree fell on and killed.

Did anyone else&#39;s power go out?  Does anyone else think it&#39;s crazy that hurricane winds traveled that far and still destroyed so much? (look at a map, Texas is a 1400 or so mile drive from Ohio)</description>

              <p>Not really.  Sometimes hurricanes will journey up from around Florida and cause heavy winds/rain all the way to Canada.  Whether or not there were news reports on whether or not Ohio would get hit or not is likely.  Unid is semi, correct, however also wrong, as most people don’t want to evacuate their homes, however news reports are not always correct on the severity of storms in different places.</p>

              <p>Didn’t they warn everyone to evacuate? If they did: go fuck yourself! Don’t telling us this bullshit because you <span class="bbcode-i">were</span> warned (there were people who actually tried to take advantage of the situation and rob other people’s homes/businesses). Also, don’t you have insurance? If you really need money, don’t worry! A lot of schools are putting fundraisers up for the ‘unfortunates’. IF they didn’t warn you ahead of time, my fault, but I know I heard it somewhere in the news. It’s also hard to notice you’re gone because you’re barely posting on the forums.</p>
