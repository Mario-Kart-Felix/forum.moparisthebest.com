              <p>Private servers don’t tend to use alot of bandwith or space. I played RS for about 7 hours in low quality and I only used 20 mb of bandwith. You wouldn’t need much space anyway for the server files.</p>
<p>But I wouldn’t personally spend alot of money on server hosting yet I would start small and work your way up. Because who want’s to spend $50+ for a few users a day on hosting?<br>
I would start with a 20 gig bandwith plan first and if you fail to use up most of that bandwith just change your plan a bit and slowly you will work out the best plan for you.</p>
<p>Hoped I’ve helped a bit.</p>
