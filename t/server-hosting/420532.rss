    <description>I would love to develop and manage a server with buildcraft industrialcraft² and redpower2 on it but the problem is that my computer can&#39;t handle it and i don&#39;t have any money to do so.
Does anyone have a vps or wants to host himself, you will be co-owner even when i do get the money to buy a vps.
I don&#39;t know if this is allowed on here but there aren&#39;t much BC IC RP servers out there and they are very good mods.</description>
