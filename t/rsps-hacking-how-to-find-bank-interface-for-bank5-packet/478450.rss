    <title>RSPS hacking - how to find bank interface for bank5 packet?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsps-hacking-how-to-find-bank-interface-for-bank5-packet/478450</link>
    <description>If I want to open up bank I can use for example 5292 and one server uses 23000 which has also bankall option. However when I try to use bank5 packet (its packet that is used for depositing/withdrawing/buying/selling) those interfaces won&#39;t work. How can I find what interface my client uses to withdraw items from bank?</description>

Both of you are wrong, I tested this packet with shop interface and I can buy with it. Since its same packet it does owrk. However when I tested default bank interfaces like 5292 and so on they do NOT work. Interface is somehow different, its propably only used in withdrawing items from bank.<br>

              <p>Usually if they don’t work, there’s a problem with how you’re reading the data. An example of this is something like using <span class="bbcode-i">readWord<span class="bbcode-i"> instead of </span>readWordA</span>, so the value appears 128 lower than it should (or higher, I forget). What you can do is make your server print out the values of the interface when you go to bank, so like <span class="bbcode-i">System.out.println("Bank " + interfaceID);</span> and you’ll get the proper ID to use.</p>
