    <title>How to make an object give random items?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-an-object-give-random-items/170790</link>
    <description>Heya, I&#39;d like help with making an object give you random items when searched. Currently it&#39;s for Barrows, and the chest is 10284, wich makes it under case 10284.

I never done anything like this neither thought of it. But I know it&#39;s possible, but I got no knowledge of it. So any help would be really great! I searched a bit and found:

[code]int randItem = misc.random[/code]

It doesn&#39;t really tell me much... Also if there&#39;s a tutorial somewhere please tell me!

If you need more information notify me.

Sincerly,
Dealman.</description>
