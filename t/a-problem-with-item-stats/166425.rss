    <title>A problem with item stats</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-problem-with-item-stats/166425</link>
    <description>I just got a new source, and I went about adding various things to get it up to scratch. But, when I added the Godswords, I put the stats in the Item.CFG as I normally would, but when I equip the item, it doesn&#39;t give the stats that I set. Does anyone know why?

Many thanks,

Syrillia.
