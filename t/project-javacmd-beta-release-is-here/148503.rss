I am not currently hosting the chat server. You may use any server that receives and broadcasts. In order to connect to your server you will need to modify the ChatClient.java file to connect to your port forwarded IP.

[project]JavaCMD
Hey guys, last night I had an idea -&gt; Why not waste my time making a Java Command prompt!
So I started making it.... I went through all of my Java files in my pc (1000&#39;s) to see if I could find anything usefull to put in my JavaCMD. After a while i found a &quot;buffered writer/reader&quot; that I put in my server once, so I took it and put it into my &quot;public class javacmd&quot; And used it as a login system, and create user system. To login, I used &quot;import java.util.Scanner;&quot; Then I needed to think of a way to handle the commands. So I used &quot;import java.util.Scanner;&quot; and a &quot;case switch&quot; so when you entered a command (1-99) it used a case from the &quot;case switch&quot; to find which command I entered.So that was More or less the command system sorted.
But then the idea popped into my head -&gt; What if it has a bug, how will the users update it?
So I searched &quot;google&quot; on how to make java download a file. Once I found out how, I set to work on &quot;public class update&quot;. So I set up a downloader which automatically updates, then compiles the new update when you open it.
It also works on linux and windows...
Ok, enough of the cheap explaining....
I will release it next week, or there-abouts...
Here is what it looks like so far...

WHY AM I DOING THIS?
Because I haven&#39;t coded java in a long time, so I just want to start re-learning it again. And I want something to fill time for the rest of the holidays.

UPDATE:
I have now added in an &quot;Engine Version Checker&quot;, so if the engine is out of date, or there are extra files available it tells you to go to the javacmd website(coming soon) and downlod the newest engine. The current engine that I have made is 0.3, if 0.4 comes out, the JavaCMD will tell you when you run it, since the updater only updates the javacmd.java file, you will manually need to add the newest engine. Untill I can be pooped to make it download the new updater, runner, extra files, and engine, you will need to visit the website..


UPDATE2:
I have now added a GUI so it works a bit better....
It also has auto-login for the admin account now...
It now auto downloads the newest version of the engine every time it boots...
I still need to make it run MS-DOS commands...
New image added.


Explination of no updates and no work being done:
I have been busy with school work over the last few weeks.


UPDATE3:
I have kinda &quot;killed&quot; the GUI, but you can still make it run, but it isn&#39;t of much use unless you do some modding.
I have added &quot;some sort of home made&quot; chat to it, so it now connects to a server, allows you to send messages, and recieve messages.
Added a boot thingy... So it tells you which files/items have been loaded.


Info about the beta:
Being released on the 13-14th of November.
After, it will no longer be able to be downloaded.
The beta will only be running for 10 days, so after 10 days, it will stop working, or just stop updating.


Future updates:
Will add a feature to the chat which allows you to connect to any server you want.
Will create a new gui
Will make it so that OS commands will need to be typed as &quot;OS %cmd% %attributes%&quot;.
And the chat client will have these commands:
-connect %ip% %port% //connects to a server
-prmsg %nameofuserwhowillget% %message% //allows you to send a private message to a name or ip
-getname %newname% //allows you to change your name from ip(*.*.*.*)
-newthread %groupname% //allows you to start your own channel on the server
-leavechat // leaves the chat
-updateclient //only way to update the chat client. Requires you to restart javacmd for update to work.
Serverside commands(server handls what you type):
*login %name% %oldip% //logs in with previous name
*admincp %name% %adminpass% //opens admincp, but requires an admin pass
*listallpreviouschats //Lists all saved chats
*userlist //list all users</description>

<p>yes i remember that well, i was going to post about it but you beat me to it,<br>
i took that little application to school, cause we can run .jar files there, and it was intresting being able to netsend and tskill for a while.</p>
<p>enough about my personal history, IMO, you’re better off making your ‘chat-room’ or some other IM client with what you have so far</p>
