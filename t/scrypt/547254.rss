<p>Well, how could using password security be better than a private algorithmic encoding? Taking more time to decode shouldn’t be an excuse.[/quote]You <span class="bbcode-b">can’t decode</span> a hash. That’s the point; it’s one way. Now just because you can’t just follow an algorithm to decode it back to its original form doesn’t mean that it’s not possible to find the original input.</p>
<p>If I have an MD5 and I wish to find what input was used to create it, it would be trivial to test millions of passwords in a very short amount of time. This time’s cut even shorter when you can use multiple GPUs spread across multiple machines. Even if you added a salt, all it does is increase the amount of passwords to try (and when you have a beefy enough machine, it will make little to no impact).</p>
<p>With something like bcrypt, the idea is to have the amount of time it takes to compute be adjustable, and not capable of being performed faster using special hardware (like GPUs). Doing this adds the extra security of not being able to calculate hundreds of hashes within milliseconds.</p>
<p>The point is even if there are trillions of possibilities, if you can test them all extremely quickly then it’s not as secure.</p>
<p>And in case you aren’t familiar where passwords are used, think about how you logged into this website.</p>

</aside>
<p>I was talking about the one-time pad, but I was just making a point; although off-topic. If you want a secure file, you wouldn’t need a password, you would just create key to shift the bytes of the file. I believe it’s easier to break through a password than an encrypted file.</p>
<p>I don’t understand why using passwords would be a better alternative. I’ve never used a password, so I guess my opinion of this couldn’t be relative.</p>

<p>Well the point of something like scrypt is that to actually generate your hashes it has to make these long computations in the first place. You can’t just compute an algorithm to make it “go faster.” The reason it is intensive like it is because it’s not only resistant to Moore’s Law but also to custom hardware attacks.

<p>scrypt techinically would share the same weakness but it now has exponential memory usage while bcrypt didn’t. I haven’t done much research into this sort of attack but this is exactly the reason scrypt was designed and so I imagine the author was able to figure out that the amount of memory required for this algorithm is too much for any cost-effective hardware; not to mention its memory usage is variable.</p>

<p>well at least i’m not a dumb 300 lb basement-dweller neckbeard hipster with a gender identity crisis, who raves and posts almost daily about all the neat little modern (actually you’re a little old) hipster1sms (and not even!) he finds, and then proceeds to chide people for calling him out on his shit. use bcrypt/scrypt or whatever the fudge that works, hell, even the higher-order shas; both of those are nice. posting dumb, laughable questions with no real purpose is a surefire way to to get replies that are just as bad. if you don’t have anything to add, other than “how’s dis guise???”, then you might as well just leave us alone (till now) and google. i don’t know if scrypt is hugely widely implemented but from misterhat’s post i’m not too sure about its prevalence (but i have faith that it gets around, since scrypt is actually not unknown.) so if you find it, and you like it, then use it. basically yea, bcrypt is good enough already, but if you want the memory-huge scrypt (which is great and better than bcrypt, theoretically, in the case of an event such as a db leak) then go for it.</p>
<p>also i believe my nice friend justaguy has posted about this before. search, go, and bye. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/cool.png?v=5" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"> :rolleyes: <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> ;D <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> :o</p>

sounds like a lousy way of making something secure. just use sha-256 or even 512 bit if you're itching for low collision rates.
