    <title>RSPS Project and Social Media?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsps-project-and-social-media/404348</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m starting my first &#39;serious&#39; RSPS project of 2011(which I hope to have up and running for years to come)

I suddenly came to this, how could I take advantage of social medias? Obviously by registering my project on them!

So, my question is... Which social medias would be good?

My current picks:

1. Youtube for video sharing
2. Photobucket of image sharing
3. Facebook for advertising/updates/competitions
4. Twitter for quick updates/competitions

I&#39;m also registered on the major RSPS communities (R-S, RL, here).

P.S. I&#39;m also trying to figure out good layout for writing game content such as quests, questlines, plots, why/when... and that stuff.(as you see, I&#39;m not going to download a PI and add 634 items to it, host it and profit. I&#39;m actually working on whole new quest lines and stuff. Very much like RuneScape but bot free and stuff)</description>
