<p>No, you will just be able to open up MoparScape, pick which version you want to use, and play it.  Or of course server owners can link to moparscape for people to play on their servers.</p>

<p>The reason it is being done this way is that in the past a group of people getting together to write a server doesn’t work out.  Of course a group can form to do it that way and then split the money up as they see fit after it is finished.  I am only interested in paying for a completed server though instead of little parts at a time, since those are already plentiful.</p>
<p>edit:<br>
Though the reason I posted this thread on this side of the forums was mainly the writing clients part, not the server contest.  Although you could do any of them.</p>

<p>I checked it, but it doesn’t appear to be broken.  They just haven’t updated since then.  The MD5’s are the same.</p>
<p>Anyway after someone releases the server to claim the money, I’ll probably put up the money to make a good updater, and with that a great bot can be made from cherokee.</p>

              <p>Wow nice. While sure private servers are associated with newfaggery this scheme might actually work to increase code quality and feature set. That is of course assuming that strict code quality standards are adhered to…</p>
<p>Maybe this effort could crosspolinate a bot?</p>
<p>Currently we are at version 615 or so. It would be good for private servers to catch up. Mopar: the rs/bin/ version checker is broken. Perhaps you could now put up a bounty?</p>
<p>PS: Can we have stats on how much people are paying for the top spots and how much you have now?<br>
