    <title>One Last thread - Cant get friends to connect. Please help. Final Issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/one-last-thread-cant-get-friends-to-connect-please-help-final-issue/509328</link>
    <description>Okay I have been at this forever.  I can&#39;t seem to figure it out or find an answer anywhere.

My client and gui.java&#39;s IP&#39;s are set to 127.0.0.1
I DID make a no-ip.  

I have been told that they need to be set to the no-ip, however when that is done I&#39;m no longer to connect.  So I switch it back to 127.0.0.1.  I then make a complete copy of my client folder (all 180 .class and .java files) and send it to a friend.  He gets it, unzips it and he tells me that run.bat isn&#39;t even there, although I&#39;m looking at it being sent - makes no sense.

I guess I have 2 eal questions.  What does my IP in the GUI and client need to be set as?  Do they ever change for me and for when I&#39;m sending the client to my friends (because I tried to keep mine on 127 and have the copied version on the no-ip but that didn&#39;t work).  Also, when I send my client to my friends, what EXACTLY am I sending?  am I just copying what mine looks like, or am I not sending the .javas, or am I making it in to a .zip?  Someone told me to make it a &quot;jar&quot; which I have no idea how/what that is.

I know its a bunch of questions but I&#39;m new at this and I&#39;m sure its a really easy fix.  This is the last thing I need before I release it.  I could really use the help.

Thanks guys.</description>

<h2>The client ip for you has to be 127.0.0.1 and the client ip for everyone else has to be your no-ip, there is usually 2 spots for it in client.java and 1 spot in gui.java, as for the server ip, it shouldnt matter, i never change mine and it always runs just fine and everyone can connect just fine, only the client ip’s matter and after changing the ip’s in the client be sure to compile it, then archive it, and then send it, it should work.</h2>
<p>Oh and be 100% sure it is online and your ports are open, try using <a href="http://canyouseeme.org" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.org</a> and a status checker.</p>

<p>Okay, so when you set the client’s ip its the same as the ip in your no-ip? Do you have the no-ip duc installed and running? If not, you need that and if it doesn’t work still you have to port forward. When I was a young nooblet I had the same problem but all it was, was my computers antivirus blocking the connection so I couldn’t connect. So look in your antivirus if you have antivirus and look for ports being blocked, etc and open the port 43594!</p>
<p>For the client you do have to “Jar” to jar it make sure you have winwar and right click the client folder and “add to archive” once it archives just upload the new jarred file to uppit and send your friend the link to the download.</p>
<p>I summed that up quite a bit but if you don’t understand some things just tell me!</p>
