    <title>711 source (Matrix) command help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/711-source-matrix-command-help/451602</link>
    <description>I downloaded a fixed version of the Matrix server (rscalifornia) and i was looking through the commands and i saw the ::item command (to spawn) and it was set for player rights = 2 and then it had a list of names, well i didn&#39;t edit the names and all and made myself admin (player rights 2) and i couldnt spawn, i could never figure out how to remove the list of names (i think due to the fact that it is specified people that can spawn that makes it so ONLY those people can spawn not anyone with player rights 2) so i was wondering if anyone could help me fix that or possibly send me a working ::item or ::pickup command please and thank you,

here is the original code for ::item
[code]		}
		
					if (cmd[0].equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;item&quot;) &amp;&amp; (player.getUsername().equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;victoria&quot;))) {  
				if (cmd.length &lt; 2){
				   if (player.getRights() &lt;= 2)  
					player.getPackets().sendGameMessage(&quot;Use: ::item id (optional:amount)&quot;);
					return true;
				}[/code]</description>

<p>but make sure to make a copy of your client and source folders so if you need to go back after a big mistake you can.</p>
