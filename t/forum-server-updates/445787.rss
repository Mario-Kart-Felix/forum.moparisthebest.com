    <description>A public update has been made to the forum today, I&#39;m sure many of you will have saw the recent Moparscape suggestions board which proved to be a brilliant success when creating a better relationship between the members and the staff. We&#39;ve now got our own, we&#39;re hoping this will encourage members to be a lot more truthful when suggesting things and to get a lot more suggestions.

This forum update does not stand alone though, for more than a week now, we have been planning numerous server changes as we edge ever closer to advertising Moparcraft. I feel this board will prove most useful at all times. 

Allow me to explain how it will work, when you post a topic here the topic because automatically moderated so only you and the administrators can see it. This allows for a new level of privacy, and allows for all types of suggestions. If you wish your topic to be approved to the public it can be if the administrators see fit. The suggestions board can be found here:

http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php/board,178.0.html

It is a child board of Moparcraft discussion. 

Finally, I&#39;ve gone ahead and made some additions to the rules today:


[ol][li]No profanity, or offensive messages in the form of blocks (whether it be on the world map, or outside somebodies house, where ever, don&#39;t do it) - This includes signs[/li]
[li]No &#39;expressing dominance&#39; to an unreasonable point - We as a community get a long, you don&#39;t kill somebody and burn their stuff because they&#39;re new, you don&#39;t harass new players and be unreasonable.[/li][/ol]


These rules are to further integrate the community, and hopefully work with our change that will be implemented into the server at a later date. We are all members of the same community, we will not accept immature and bullying behavior anymore.</description>
