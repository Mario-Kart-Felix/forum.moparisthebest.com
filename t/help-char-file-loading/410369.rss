              <p>yeah we did, we tryed accounts that had been already created, the owner also used teamviewer to try signing in on his account but that also failed. also, also i hadnt logged in to have anytimes, apparently my ip doesnt even show up on the server cmd when i attempt to login, which from what i’ve seen means error connecting to server, which cant be the problem because other people are connecting</p>
