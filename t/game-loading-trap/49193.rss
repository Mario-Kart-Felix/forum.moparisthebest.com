    <title>Game loading trap</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/game-loading-trap/49193</link>
    <description>Well I was reading semaphore&#39;s [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,10294.0.html]&quot;Effective System Creation&quot;[/url] article and I noticed how much emphasis he put into loader caused traps. Recently a lot of my work has been put towards the game loader instead of the client itself. I recently found a potential yet obviously detectable trap implemented in order for Jagex to find out if you loaded the game via the loader or direct client class loading. For those who aren&#39;t familiar with the loader and how it initializes the client I will give a code snippet.

[code]
Class sign_link = Class.forName(&quot;c&quot;);
rs_class_loader.hash_table.put(sign_link.getName(), sign_link);
client = rs_class_loader.loadClass(&quot;client&quot;);
game_applet = (Applet)client.newInstance();
client.getMethod(&quot;providesignlink&quot;, new Class[] {
    sign_link
}).invoke(null, new Object[] {
    loader_sign_link
});
game_applet.init();
game_applet.start();
return;
[/code]

Variables and functions have been refactored for readability. One important note to keep in mind is their is a sign link class provided with both the loader and the client. Both of them are represented in two different classes [i]c[/i], although they have the same internal structure (same field names and function names). What happens in the loader code above is a function named [i]providesignlink[/i] is called and a loader_sign_link object is sent to the client.

Now let&#39;s take a look at [i]providesignlink[/i] in the client&#39;s parent class.

[code]
//trimmed out unimportant code
public static final void providesignlink(c c1)
{
    vd.rb = na.d = c1;
}
[/code]

This is where the trap starts to become apparent. Let&#39;s now analyze the following code snippet in the client&#39;s parent class.

[code]
//called directly from main(String args[]) - frame initialization
//trimmed out unimportant code
final void a(/*several arguments*/)
{
    vd.rb = na.d = new c(true, null, inetaddress, i1, s1, l1);
}

//called directly from init() - applet initialization
//trimmed out unimportant code
final void a(/*several arguments*/)
{
    if(na.d == null)
        vd.rb = na.d = new c(false, this, InetAddress.getByName(getCodeBase().getHost()), i1, null, 0);
}
[/code]

As you can see the function called when you begin a Frame (or Jframe) creates a new sign link object no matter what. In the function called when you launch an applet (through init()) however, it checks for nullness on the sign link object before creating one. Either way, if you do NOT use the loader your client will create a new sign link object. If you do use the loader files:


[ul][li]The first function (called from main(String[]) will not be called.[/li]
[li]The second function (called from init()) will not create a new sign link object because the sign link object will be non null (because loader_sign_link was sent to [i]providesignlink[/i] during the loader phase).[/li][/ul]


This is where it gets interesting. Let&#39;s take a look at any differences we can spot between the sign link class provided with the loader and with the client.

[code]
//client&#39;s sign link
public static int d = 3;

//loader&#39;s sign link
public static int d = 1;
[/code]

This is the only difference which can be spotted. A while ago I was reading how Jagex uses reflection routines to get field/method data from the client and send it back to their server. I investigated into this and now I can confirm it (probably not news for any of you :P). This is how people who aren&#39;t using the loader are being detected. Jagex sends (seems to be inconsistent and random, maybe triggered with detection related server side flags?) to the client a request for reflection data (a [i]get[/i] routine in this case) on field [i]na.d.d[/i] or [i]vd.rb.d[/i]. If you are using the sign link class provided with the client, meaning you haven&#39;t used the loader, the server receives a [i]3[/i]. Bad news, Jagex just flagged you for game loading tampering, this may cause several other detection server side flags to go on and further investigate your client.

How to fix this trap:


[ul][li]Use BCEL to modify field [i]d[/i] (will change with updates) in signlink class to value 1.[/li]
[li][b]USE THE LOADER.[/b][/li][/ul]


I hope I was clear enough, if you have any questions I&#39;d be glad to help you.

Note 1. Values [i]1[/i] for loader sign link and [i]3[/i] for client sign link seem to be consistent through out versions. Could be subject to change.

Note 2. All values used in this article are taken from client #445.


Edit 1. Fixed typos.</description>

<p>Now at least in linux and windows on both firefox and IE7 applets use the following class as their SecurityManager:</p>

<p>So if you set that as your SecurityManager, and then load and run the client without the use of jagex’s loader, it would be undetectable correct?</p>
<p>Certainly they could flag you if you did not use the loader while running a signed applet or application, but if it is unsigned the loader is not used at all, so they could not penalize you for it.</p>

<p>As you can see the function called when you begin a Frame (or Jframe) creates a new sign link object no matter what.

<p>This is the only difference which can be spotted. A while ago I was reading how Jagex uses reflection routines to get field/method data from the client and send it back to their server. I investigated into this and now I can confirm it (probably not news for any of you :P). This is how people who aren’t using the loader are being detected. Jagex sends (seems to be inconsistent and random, maybe triggered with detection related server side flags?) to the client a request for reflection data (a <span class="bbcode-i">get</span> routine in this case) on field <span class="bbcode-i">na.d.d</span> or <span class="bbcode-i">vd.rb.d</span>. If you are using the sign link class provided with the client, meaning you haven’t used the loader, the server receives a <span class="bbcode-i">3</span>. Bad news, Jagex just flagged you for game loading tampering, this may cause several other detection server side flags to go on and further investigate your client.</p>
<p>How to fix this trap:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Use BCEL to modify field <span class="bbcode-i">d</span> (will change with updates) in signlink class to value 1.[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-b">USE THE LOADER.</span>[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>I hope I was clear enough, if you have any questions I’d be glad to help you.</p>
<p>Note 1. Values <span class="bbcode-i">1</span> for loader sign link and <span class="bbcode-i">3</span> for client sign link seem to be consistent through out versions. Could be subject to change.</p>
<p>Note 2. All values used in this article are taken from client <span class="hashtag">#445</span>.</p>
<p>Edit 1. Fixed typos.</p>
