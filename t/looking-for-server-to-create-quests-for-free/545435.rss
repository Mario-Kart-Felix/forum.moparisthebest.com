    <title>Looking for server to create quests for [FREE!]</title>

    <description>Hi im Luke

I enjoy creating story lines for rsps quests, and i am not at the stage were i would like to look for new servers to help out with quest building.

I know many server owners/coder cant really be bothered to create quests for there server because they don&#39;t really want to come up with a story line because it is really time consuming.

So im offering to create quest story lines for servers, so that the community will appreciate the time that has been spent on quests.

If yo are interested please contact through this facebook page: [url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Legacy-Network/1432966086984526?ref_type=bookmark]https://www.facebook.com/pages/Legacy-Network/1432966086984526?ref_type=bookmark[/url]

              <p>I’d recommend looking through the Development Teams forum and check if any server owners are looking for help developing quests. Alternatively you could message server owners seen in this forum asking the same thing. We don’t have a place for people to post topics such as this, so I’m going to go ahead and lock this thread.</p>
