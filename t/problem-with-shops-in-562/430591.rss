    <title>Problem with shops in 562</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-shops-in-562/430591</link>
    <description>alright so i followed this tutorial to the T http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,468514.0.html and somehow something isn&#39;t right. i get no errors on compile or anything. So im trying to spawn one of the npc&#39;s for the shop that has been premade such as a weapon shop, and to said coords. party pete is the weapons vendor and when i list him in the npcs.xml, he spawns just fine but doesnt open the shop. the files i have edited are shops.java, summonpackethandler, shophandler, and of course npcs.html. am i missing a command for him to open the shop?</description>
