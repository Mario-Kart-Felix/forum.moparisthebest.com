    <description>Yes I&#39;m aware that Lothy And Miss Silabsoft have removed them, I couldn&#39;t care less. This is mostly aimed at the moderators, Who removed them.
By removing those topics don&#39;t you feel that &quot;you cut your nose of to spite your face?&quot;
They were there, even though they wern&#39;t used for there correct purposes. They did keep the worthless crap out of General discussion to a certain degree. They also gave us a chance to have heated discussions that normally anywhere else wouldn&#39;t be alowed. Could you maybe concider Bringing them back?</description>

              <p>For any real suggestion or complaint pm a staff member. don’t create a topic about it we don’t need you making a mess of the general section. If the complaint is about a moderator send it to a different moderator or send it directly to moparisthebest.</p>
<p>As for the RSC section report the posts and a RSC moderator or global moderator will view the report in the report section.</p>

              <p>Basically the staff decided that if the actual suggestion is worth considering the member can simple use the general section to create a new topic about it.</p>
<p>The old stickies had some very decent suggestions and valid complaints but really both topics comprised of spam and flame by people that were not even involved with an issue.</p>
<p>We (as a moderating team) definitely payed close attention to every single post made in the old stickies and now with seperate topics it’ll make it even easier. Plus seperate topics should stop suggestions digressing.</p>
