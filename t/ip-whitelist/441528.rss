    <title>IP Whitelist</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ip-whitelist/441528</link>
    <description>After running RSCE for years I&#39;ve seen so many people get hacked, lose their items and then quit private servers completely because they cannot be bothered to earn their stuff back or whatever. They probably got hacked because they used an easy password, used the same password on another private server, used a bot or something else that could be prevented.

On RSCE we have a recovery system in place so they can recover their account via recovery questions but that doesn&#39;t mean much when they&#39;ve lost their entire bank.

I was thinking of a IP Whitelist system where basically it won&#39;t let them login in-game unless their IP is on the whitelist. To add your current IP you simply login to the website and enter your recovery questions which will add the IP you&#39;re behind to your accounts whitelist. You can remove IP&#39;s from the list by simply clicking remove.

It&#39;s an optional feature that they will have to enable. Without enabling it you wouldn&#39;t know it&#39;s there.

Can anyone see any flaws in this? Is there any way to spoof an IP or anything through Java?

It&#39;s kind of like a bank pin system I guess, but I&#39;d hate having to enter a bank pin every single time I login.

I suppose you could enter a bank pin which then remembers the IP, and it only asks for a bank pin if it&#39;s a new IP? Still though I wanted to leave the game untouched so wanted to keep everything done via the website.</description>

              <p>Even with all this extra layer of security, 80% of the players are too lazy to even bother with it. Even with the current recovery system you have now, you still get a bunch of kids getting hacked, because after setting the first 1 or 2 accounts, they just don’t bother with the rest.</p>
<p>The only way I can see it being effective is if you make a GUI feature in-game that players can access and be able to set/control that way, otherwise it’s too much of a inconvenience really. Honestly when I played RSCE or even RSC after my first few accounts, I didn’t bother setting my recovery’s or anything because I was too lazy lol. Now if RSC had a GUI client side, then I would probably do it since i’m already on the game, etc. But as you said you didn’t want to touch anything client sided, i’m really not sure how else you can do it.</p>
<p>Though to add on to your idea, you could possible make a list of what authentication a player can use to protect there account, whether it be IP Whitelisting, recovery questions, MAC address, etc. That way a player can pick which one they feel more comfortable with. (Also to help prevent any problems one player may be having with 1 of the authentication ways).</p>

Even the ‘SOME’ wouldn’t know the MAC address of the victims computer.<br>
If they guessed the password, or if they are running standalone keylogger(Maybe even a RAT, not sure), they can’t get their hands on the persons MAC address. Of course they could develop one that displays the MAC address, but most of the ‘hackers’ are just kids with no knowledge of anything.</p>

<p>This is entirely impossible, well, useless might be a better word.  The hardware MAC address is unique to each piece of hardware, but it isn’t verified anywhere along the line of the IP stack, so the client can tell you that it is literally anything, and since you can NEVER trust what the client tells you, it’s 100% useless as a form of authentication or identity.[/quote]<br>

<p>You already apparently have some way to measure how many people get hacked/quit (thousands you say) so I would assume you’d be able to measure the effect that the system would have. So try it and see if it works and whether people even use it/like it, then decide whether or not to keep it.</p>

<p>The system will launch with RSCD and they will be reminded in-game every time they login to set their recovery questions (like you are on RSC) so I’m hoping pretty much everyone will set them and if they don’t it’s their own fault really.</p>
