    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-shop-questions-pi/425301</link>
    <description>Hey, So I need help with stuff with shops in my server. The first problem is when you click value in some shops it says it currently costs 0 points, When it should say this currently costs amount GP.

Also next thing its not a problem but if anyone knows how to do this tell me, Ok the first shop is what my shop looks like and the second is another server&#39;s and I wan&#39;t mine to be like that bigger, with more space.

And also how do I make that unlimited sign come up with unlimited items?

              <p>I don’t know the complete fix for the “costs 0 points” but I know something that might help. Go to the shophandler.java and search for the items id’s, chances are they are in there. If you take them out it should fix that problem.<br>
I’m a beginner coder so i don’t know if this will help since I don’t know exactly what to do.</p>

<p>Im pretty sure you read wrong, I said it says it costs 0 “Points” not GP if it was GP that will be an easy fix I know that already… Also the 0 makes the sign but you can’t buy it…</p>
