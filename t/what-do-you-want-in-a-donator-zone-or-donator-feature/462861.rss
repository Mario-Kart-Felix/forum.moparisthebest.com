              <p>The <span class="hashtag">#1</span> cause of death for most online games, is the introduction of “pay-to-win” mechanics. The only reason RuneScape hasn’t been utterly destroyed by it, is because they employ different servers for paid content, and paid content can’t be used in an advantage over non-members. The only things that donators should get in return is perhaps, a mention in a Donator’s page on the website, if you have forums, perhaps a custom title/rank. Nothing more.</p>
<p>People should donate because they like your product, and want to support it. Perhaps once a month you can hold a raffle for all donators, and they win some money, or armor, something.</p>

              <p>Give them membership, not a donor zone. With membership, give them more content and by more content, I mean; Access to better training areas, faster methods of making money and so on. Keep all the other(original) content free to use and just add simple things like that for players to enjoy once they donate to your server. Most players enjoy servers more when there’s things to do. So by adding something like this isn’t really recommended. You should keep everything free to use so that it’s fair for every player.</p>

<p>I can’t think of anything else that wouldn’t be counted as a huge benefit.</p>

<p>That’s even worse than having Donor Shops. Go ahead and make Rings with extra statistics for Donors too, but don’t tell anyone about them. Make them keep on death while you’re at it. Let’s cut off half of the RuneScape map and give people who donate both halves. Split your Item configuration in half, this way you can give children with credit cards twice the items that normal players have! It’s totally up to you, but virtual goods in exchange for currency is paying to win. I’m not trying to belittle your ideas. I’m just telling you like it is.</p>
<p>TL;DR   Doesn’t matter what I say if you’re after the $$. Good luck with those donator-only Minigames and Quests. Your players will love that.</p>
