    <title>No-Scape Project Looking For A Team?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/no-scape-project-looking-for-a-team/534499</link>
    <description>Welcome to my topic about my project that i am making yes i am looking for some development team to give me a hand on this project i have worked on this project by myself for mouths and put a lot of heart and soul into i want this to work out and also for my community to have fun.


you can see my forums here its a epic one worked really hard on it [url=http://no-scape.info/]No-Scape[/url]

No-Scape Goals &amp; Achievements:

[code]
Here on No-Scape, we strive for the best content, and a happy community. 
These are the things I&#39;m hoping to accomplish, developing No-Scape

Making sure the economy is stable
This can be done several ways. Items will be hard to obtain, money will be earned fairly, no donation 
shops.

Bosses
There are, to boost the economy, and to give the players an oppurtunity to have fun while pvming.

Travelling
Travelling has been simplified. You will only need your two feet, and the ingame sailor, to get around 
on No-Scape. Quick &amp; easy dialogues, easy to use.

Training combat
I have chosen to stay with the magic book teleporting, since it&#39;s effective, and a really easy way to get around. 
You will be able to teleport to various areas to train up your combat skills.

Training non-combat
As stated above, several times, to get around on No-Scape, you use the magic books. The magic books can teleport 
you to every city that is useable, and since skilling is pretty much spread around in the game-world, 
skilling will be in an ease.

Community
I am hoping for a big, and respectful community, not only ingame, but on our forums aswell.

What Is No-Scape Have not Harded It Before? 

No-Scape is a rsps server that is designed for the player. No-Scape is an economy server, with loads of features including skills, bosses 
and minigames. You can do whatever pleases you on No-Scape, such as go questing, PvP with some of your friends, or maybe just hang 
and chat! The server is economized strategically so that no item that can be obtained by a boss or minigame, is in a shop. Another great 
concept is our PvP system. We have designed it so that when you kill someone, you get a random number out of 5, PvP Points. This provides 
the thrill we all loved when we k03d that special someone in the wilderness. We hope you enjoy your stay at No-Scape!
