The economy and government is corrupt. 99% of that money is either stolen by government officials directed  to powerful peoples bank accounts. Kids are starting  jobs at the age of 10.

One day her aunt told her to call a stranger uncle and obey him at all times. Then she was taken away by him to some family to work for them. She had to do a lot of the work there. One day the police caught the man she call uncle and arrested him. Now she lives in a shelter. Abraham is 14 and works as a vulcanizer. He repairs tires that have been pooped or punctured. He has to live in a horrible environment everyday. He can’t see his parents becuase he doesn’t have enough money. He sleeps where he works. Sekinat is 13 and is a hawker, he sets up tables and sells goods on them. It may seem like an easy job and first, but there is a big change you might get run over by a car. His foot got run over by a car once and now its broken. Soddeg is 14 and works as a grinder. he grinds yams into a fine powder called fufu. it is a popular food. Grinding is very dangerous and with all the powder everywhere you can easily suffocate to death while you work.</code></pre>
