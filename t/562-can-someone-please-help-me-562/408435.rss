    <description>I will rep you when I get 15 rep myself if you help, Plus I have asked so many times today and no-one has posted on any of my threads they just fall and everyone is ignoring them!  :(

Okay my server is really p***ing me off right now, mainly because the client will not (Will NOT) connect to the server. The ports are forwarded absolutly fine, My other versions work just fine also, I&#39;m not sure if I have set up the Class_a.java file correctly, theres addresses that I don&#39;t really know if they need changing. I also don&#39;t know how to set up the world lists properly however the client detects the worlds I have, so it is somewhat working.

Whenever I try to log into the client it says that it can&#39;t connect to the server, Yet the cache downloads properly and correctly along with the client able to list my worlds. I am really confused why I can&#39;t log in.

[size=14pt]All help is appreciated, Please post any suggestions and ideas thanks![/size]</description>

              <p>There are many reason’s to this.</p>
<p>Reason 1. If you are using ‘562 Loading 602’ It cannot download the cache, so it will “NOT” connect. period. To fix this problem, Pm me for download link for Right Client.</p>
<p>Reason 2. You’re firewall may be blocking the connection. Try disabling it, then try logging in.</p>
<p>Reason 3. You’re Cache, File ‘May’ Not be in the C:/ drive?</p>
<p>Anyway’s if you have more questions, Pm me. I’ll be more then happy to help.</p>
