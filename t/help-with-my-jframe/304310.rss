    <title>Help with my JFrame</title>

    <description>Hi, on my client&#39;s JFrame I recently added a Notes Tab that can allow you to type things you need to remember when your playing the server and what not... I have it so my client reads the text in a file I made called &quot;notes.txt&quot; but ow can I make it so when I exit the client anything that you have in the notes tab is saved to &quot;notes.txt&quot; I know tis is very hard to understand but I will show you what I mean with a picture.
