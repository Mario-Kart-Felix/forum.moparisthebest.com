    <title>Do you think Drinking Is better than Weed?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/do-you-think-drinking-is-better-than-weed/519965</link>
    <description>Well, i have gotten caught smoking weed by my parents. The school found i had a pipe, in my backpack. My parents were torn apart. They said they didnt care if i smoked regular cigarettes, or drink &amp; become an alcoholic. As long as i stay&#39;d away from drugs. Which do you think would be a better choice, weed or drinking?</description>

I drink all weekend and every wednesday and if I miss a day I start getting shakes and stuff so I’m pretty much stuck to a routine with that and I honestly have never came into any issues with drinking health-wise. There’s always the few wannabe hard nuts who think they’re tough (if thats what americans still call it, going from childhood tv shows here) and you will end up getting in quite a few fights, but who cares? Who doesn’t love a fight when they’re drunk?</p>
<p>just make sure you’re not a pussy like tillly. (watch him go on about I AM NOT MMA THEREFORE I CANOT FITE LIKE U)<br>

<p>Idk I rather smoke then having your beer belly. If you haven’t notice a problem with drinking I suggest you weigh yourself (not hating :D).</p>
<p>[size=14pt]But this will sum everything up for you:[/size]</p>

<p>“Grows brain cells”</p>
<p>Do some research. Marijuana won’t help you grow brain cells, although it won’t kill them either.</p>
<p>“Cures cancer”</p>
<p>:palm:</p>
<p>One study in mice and rats suggested that cannabinoids may have a protective effect against the development of certain types of tumors.[3] During this 2-year study, groups of mice and rats were given various doses of THC by gavage. A dose-related decrease in the incidence of hepatic adenoma tumors and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was observed in the mice. Decreased incidences of benign tumors (polyps and adenomas) in other organs (mammary gland, uterus, pituitary, testis, and pancreas) were also noted in the rats. In another study, delta-9-THC, delta-8-THC, and cannabinol were found to inhibit the growth of Lewis lung adenocarcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo .[4] In addition, other tumors have been shown to be sensitive to cannabinoid-induced growth inhibition.[5-8]<br>

<p>“non-addictive”</p>
<p>Anything can be psychologically addictive. Marijuana causes addiction in 10% of users (compare to 20+% for heroin and 35% for nicotine).</p>
<p>“Saves police &amp; NHS billions”</p>
<p>Ever heard of the War on Drugs…?</p>
<p>I digress…</p>
<p>SWIM loves Marijuana and believes it helps relieve stress and can be a positive thing in your life. With that in mind, anything has the ability to become psychologically addictive if you abuse it. Too much of a good thing can be bad.</p>

<p>Weed is not addictive. I just quit 1 week ago I’ve been clean for 1 and a half week it was not hard to quit. I use to be a daily smoker I was on a streak before I quit a 2 week streak actually. So don’t say its addictive if you never tried.</p>

The term addiction is also sometimes applied to compulsions that are not substance-related, such as compulsive shopping, sex addiction/compulsive sex, overeating, problem gambling, exercise/sport and computer addiction. Sometimes the compulsion is not to “do” something but to avoid or “do nothing” e.g. procrastination (compulsive task avoidance).[11][12][13] In these kinds of common usages, the term addiction is used to describe a recurring compulsion by an individual to engage in some specific activity, despite harmful consequences, as deemed by the user themselves to their individual health, mental state, or social life. There may be biological and psychological factors contributing to these addictions.[14][/quote]</p>

              <blockquote>Behavioral addiction[edit]
<p>Main articles: Behavioral addiction and Addictive behavior<br>
The term addiction is also sometimes applied to compulsions that are not substance-related, such as compulsive shopping, sex addiction/compulsive sex, overeating, problem gambling, exercise/sport and computer addiction. Sometimes the compulsion is not to “do” something but to avoid or “do nothing” e.g. procrastination (compulsive task avoidance).[11][12][13] In these kinds of common usages, the term addiction is used to describe a recurring compulsion by an individual to engage in some specific activity, despite harmful consequences, as deemed by the user themselves to their individual health, mental state, or social life. There may be biological and psychological factors contributing to these addictions.[14]</p>

<p>There are many forms of addiction that may occur when smoking pot, on it’s own it’s not addictive however, it can be addictive for certain individuals.</p>
<p>tl;dr<br>
People <span class="bbcode-b">can</span> be addicted to pot, end of story lol. But it’s not an addictive substance itself.</p>

Weed is not addictive you fuckin idiot, if a person is dependant on the high it gives them, that is completely of their own accord.<br>
It’s not weeds fault they have an addictive personality and will be addicted to anything that preoccupies them for a period of time.<br>
While weed does not completely make cancer disappear clearly,<br>
It allows patients who undergo treatments that are brutal on the body and cause negative reactions like,<br>
lack of appetite and weakness/pain to be able ignore these symptoms and continue living a regular life.</p>

<p>weed isn’t a drug man, it’s nature. why do you think it’s banned in a lot of countrys? weed is a mind opener, cannabis is used for ages. in nearly all religions except Christianity, oh what a coincidence there.</p>
<p>regular cigarettes, or drink &amp; become an alcoholic thats loveing poison. it’s a product. do what ever you like man in the end you die.</p>
<p>the people who die from smoking are the people who smoke regular cigarettes, nearly NO ONE if anyone dies from cannabis, you have more chance of getting cancer. which isn’t a joke, cancer is getting very common</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’d like to straighten a little thing here up… NOBODY has EVER died of cannabis. &lt;- Is a fact, Google tells you this if you are unsure. Also, NOBODY has EVER died of psilocybin. (The main psychoactive solution in “Magic mushrooms” such as Psilocybe Semilanceata) To get an overdose of these two (Cannabinoids or Psilocybin) is next to impossible. I’ve heard of Psilocybe Cubensis having it’s lethal amount around 14 Kgs of mushrooms. Try eating those in a day!<br>
[/quote]<br>
Just because the internet says something does that mean it’s true? Nope. Regardless, who cares if no-one’s died from it? If you aren’t an idiot with drink you don’t die with that either. Just because you <span class="bbcode-b">can</span> die from it doesn’t mean that someone who doesn’t abuse it will die if they drink. I’ve done week long drink stints in bulgaria and maga and I’m still standing.[/quote]</p>
<p>Oh, wait! Did I really tell that my info was from the internet? I haven’t checked this by Googleing if there are these results, I’ve <span class="bbcode-b">heard</span> it elsewhere. However it is a well known test-result. And from the “who cares …” -part onwards, I see you don’t care at least! And why I brought up this “no one has died …” -thing in the first place is that it is at least more healthy than alcohol to smoke weed, because isn’t that a part of “Which is better”? I hope this clarifies a lil’…?</p>
