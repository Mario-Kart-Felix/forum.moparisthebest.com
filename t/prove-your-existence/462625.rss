    <title>Prove your existence</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/prove-your-existence/462625</link>
    <description>Prove to me that you are really here as a person. Prove that everything you&#39;ve done since birth has been of your own accord.

Are you sure that everything you&#39;ve done hasn&#39;t been scripted by some &quot;higher power&quot;? Every interaction you encounter perfectly placed for every conscious human being in order deceive us into believing we have our own will?

Send me your thoughts.

P.S. I just woke up from a weird dream, stfu, I&#39;m not dumb. :(</description>

              <p>You can’t, for all we know when you die you wake up and realize it was all a dream. To me, that seems like a good theory since the same thing happens when we dream and when we come out of it, it is very cool to try and stay awake in dreams, once your aware enough reality in a dream can feel really real. But it isn’t. If there’s life after that then that’s probably what would happen.</p>
<p>Either way, we can’t prove existence</p>

<p>Also, define why, in our evolution as a human species, we’ve come to define a combination of letters to hold specific values and why we understand that?</p>
<p>Also, what defines a human? Is it emotion? Ability to think? Wouldn’t that make extraterrestrial beings human by definition?</p>

              <p>Strange how old this topic is, and yet unresolved.</p>
<p>When i was a kid i used to believe there was a possibility of everyone around me being robots, and i being the only normal person. I didn’t know why, but i was always curious to know that they were indeed human rather then a robot. I found out later, that i wasn’t the only one with these thoughts. As it turns out many others i had told this to had situations like this themselves. So i wouldn’t say thinking you’re the only person is arrogant, paranoid maybe, but not arrogant.</p>
<p>As everyone is born differently, and experiences different events and emotions, i doubt it is possible that you aren’t making actions based on free will. To think that someone controls you is saddening. For you to believe that this world does not allow you to do what you choose, your thoughts must be extremely restricted and plain. Personally, i don’t think someone should prove that they exist because we are seen, heard and felt. If anything you should prove that we don’t exist, tell me that my life means nothing because i am controlled by thoughts and actions. That would be far more interesting.</p>

You say I’m an illusion? Sure, but “what I am” is not what you were asking. Even if I am an illusion.<br>
The illusion exists since you are asking it a question.<br>
As long as you are addressing “something” then this “something” is relevant to you in some way and therefore this “something” exists (because what doesn’t exist is not relevant).<br>
So by asking me to prove my existence, you are answering your own question. ^.^[/quote]<br>

You say I’m an illusion? Sure, but “what I am” is not what you were asking. Even if I am an illusion.<br>
The illusion exists since you are asking it a question.<br>
As long as you are addressing “something” then this “something” is relevant to you in some way and therefore this “something” exists (because what doesn’t exist is not relevant).<br>
So by asking me to prove my existence, you are answering your own question. ^.^</p>

I’m a bit surprised you made that post; I thought you may have been an intelligent individual.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I made the post for my own amusement, sometimes I like to see how people will respond. Burden of proof aside, I made an empty claim to contradict his empty claim.</p>
<p>I agree with you that we can’t be certain that the soul doesn’t exist. But it would be even more foolish to be certain that they do exist.</p>
<p>edit: And I’m far from intelligent. :P[/quote]<br>
I do exactly the same thing all the time, I tend to post posts that have flaws purposely embedded within them so I can observe how people respond; purely a learning experience for me a pose to you doing it for amusement. We both know/should know that telling the individual your doing it completely ruins the purpose of what your doing as people will respond differently. It’s like getting a take-out with a female friend to learn things she likes then telling her that; do you think that she will respond the same as before?<br>
I still haven’t given you enough information for you to comment on my thought process on the matter, well anything that’s not common sense/previously been stated (I can sense you will probably attempt to make an aggressive counter response to that  hence why I stated that to save you time unless you can prove me wrong + aggressive doesn’t mean it’s an emotional response, it has multiple meanings).<br>
My point was not anything to do with souls, you actually just said what my point is ("I agree with you that we can’t be certain that <span class="bbcode-s">the soul</span> thing’s that have been proven wrong by current technology don’t exist as we are not at the stage technologically where we can say for absolute certainty that we are correct as in the past that has happened and we have been proven wrong. "). I modified something you said which was on the right lines of what I was saying; I added more to it though ofc. You may reread previous posts by myself and check the edit date to make sure that this point I am stating is the same as the one in previous posts. If you do not think my previous posts do not state this point please state how.</p>
<p>Insults aside, you are intelligent. To be intelligent you must be above average IQ (it’s the only system that works to an extent at measuring intelligence that I know of although of course it’s hugely flawed) by a decent percentage in my opinion. From previous posts you have seemed much more intelligent than people in this forum, and a decent percentage above people who’s educational experience isn’t in an specialized area.<br>
Being humble about it is a good way to improve your social status and so on but on an internet forum where social status doesn’t matter a whole lot it’s okay to admit it (that is not me butt-kissing you, it is me just stating to what I believe is facts; this may vary on ones view(s) on things).</p>
