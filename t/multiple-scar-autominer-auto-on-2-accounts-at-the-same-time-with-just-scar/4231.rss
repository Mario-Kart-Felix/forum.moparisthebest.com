    <description>[CENTER][size=25pt]Multiple Scar Auto miner
Version - 1.0 beta[/size][/CENTER]
EDIT - script can know only be found - [url=http://www.scar-resources.ir8.ca/forums]www.scar-resources.ir8.ca/forums[/url]

The first of its kind!, a multiple scar auto miner with no outside resources except the srl include pack. After i exsperimented with some of scars lesser appreciated functions i stumbled across some very use full things and put together this script.

this script uses 2 scar windows and 2 scar windows which both share the same mouse, so it does differ to the new ubi bot.[U] Before i go on i would like to explain that this script is in its BETA and will be improved with the help of testers and reports.[/U] Alot mroe cna be done with the fucntions ive used and i hope to take full advantage of them as soon as you post feedback. ALOT of hard work went into this script :( please dont unappreciate it as i can remove it at anytime and cease updating.

You will need to open two scar windows 
then open one official runescape window 
know visit my world switcher and open another window [URL=http://&quot;http://www.scar-resources.ir8.ca/worlds.php&quot;]HERE[/URL]

It is vital that you DO NOT open two official runescape windows but one official and one from my site.

[U]Your screen should know look something like this - [/U]

NOTE - remember to open the &quot;sender&quot; script first and the &quot;receiver&quot; script after to allow you to start and stop the sender with ctrl+alt+r and ctrl+alt+s.

Your scar windows should look a bit like this -

[URL=http://imageshack.us][IMG]http://img275.imageshack.us/img275/5778/pic21es.png[/img][/URL]

Know you have completed this simply enter the data needed (usernames and pass and rock types) then click play on the receiver miner, do not worry about it doing anything because it will only do so once the sender has completed its first mining attempt.

Know bring the official runescape client to the front and press ctrl+alt+run :)

The reports will be something like this - 

scar 1

The script should set up, get the rock colors then switch clients do the same and mine in a loop. I hope you appreciate the ammount of work that i have put into these scripts and give me feedback to improve them. And please cech out my site or forums for antisipated updates and news - [URL=http://&quot;http://www.scar-resources.ir8.ca/&quot;]HERE[/URL]

many thx,

solemn wishes.

p.s. i did spellcheck some of it :D</description>

              <p>[quote=“Ron, post:3, topic:4231”]This is wonderful solemn! Good work man. This, when it comes out of beta, be much better than UBI. UBI is around 28 MB while this is just 2 scar windows open and a sender and receiver scar scripts. That’s pretty awesome man! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Edit: This is my 1000th post. Oh Joy! lol[/quote]<br>
How is this better compared to ubi, it still use the windows mouse, ubi dosn’t use the windows mouse and allow a unlmited amount of scars to be running at the same time, sending commands to multiple clients at the same time, infact it allows multiple scar to send command to one applet also.<br>
ubi allows</p>
<p>multiple these all running at the same instant:<br>
{ multiple scar-&gt; one applet   }<br>
{ one scar -&gt; applet}<br>
{multiple scar -&gt; multiple applet}</p>
<p>I-bot goes a step forward by completly replacing scar.[br][size=1]Posted at: July 10, 2006, 04:59:25 PM[/size][hr]solemn wishes,</p>
<p>how to use ubi in your application dev:<br>
I pm you the private I-Bot svn, i prefer new devolpment for ubi be on that.</p>
<p>on applet load a gui appears select mode UBI:</p>
<p>Ok in scar prog, you can look at the<br>
public UBI svn scar for how genodemon does it:<br>
svn://www.impsoft.net/svn/Scar/includes/ubi.scar<br>
use this ONLY for getting the genos modified SRL<br>
use the other svn i give in pm<br>
Ok after ubi is turned on:</p>
<p>open: C:impsoftappletList.imp<br>
This stores all applet rerences delimtered by %<br>
62659406java.lang.Runtime@1fa39bb%<br>
java.lang.Runtime@1fa39bb is the runtime<br>
62659406 is the applet refrence</p>
<p>for the info above in scar make a file somewhere temp</p>
<p>write ‘cRed 62659406’ to the file<br>
then move the file to C:impsoftjava.lang.Runtime@1e152f4input</p>
<p>Now that specified applet will have the red box for a second.<br>
UBI will eat the file, the name dosn’t matter.</p>
<p>Now repeat this for all applet in hte list till you the one scar is looking at responds then you know your runtime and applet id</p>
<p>Here is a list of commands</p>
<p>sendtext Appletidentifier “hello world”<br>
cRed Appletidentifier<br>
move Appletidentifier x y<br>
clickR Appletidentifier x y<br>
clickL Appletidentifier x y<br>
auto clickR Appletidentifier timeAllowedInMillsecs x y<br>
auto clickL Appletidentifier timeAllowedInMillsecs x y<br>
auto move Appletidentifier timeAllowedInMillsecs x y</p>
<p>‘auto’ commands use the internal mouse manager which generates a path and randomizes the speed.  timeAllowedInMillsecs tells the manager how long it has, if a new auto order comes down before the manager is done, it stops mid movement and continues toward the new order.</p>

              <p>This is wonderful solemn! Good work man. This, when it comes out of beta, be much better than UBI. UBI is around 28 MB while this is just 2 scar windows open and a sender and receiver scar scripts. That’s pretty awesome man! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

              <p>[CENTER][size=25pt]Multiple Scar Auto miner<br>
Version - 1.0 beta[/size][/CENTER]<br>
EDIT - script can know only be found - <a href="http://www.scar-resources.ir8.ca/forums" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">www.scar-resources.ir8.ca/forums</a></p>
<p>The first of its kind!, a multiple scar auto miner with no outside resources except the srl include pack. After i exsperimented with some of scars lesser appreciated functions i stumbled across some very use full things and put together this script.</p>
<p>this script uses 2 scar windows and 2 scar windows which both share the same mouse, so it does differ to the new ubi bot.<span class="bbcode-u"> Before i go on i would like to explain that this script is in its BETA and will be improved with the help of testers and reports.</span> Alot mroe cna be done with the fucntions ive used and i hope to take full advantage of them as soon as you post feedback. ALOT of hard work went into this script <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> please dont unappreciate it as i can remove it at anytime and cease updating.</p>
<p>[CENTER][SIZE=25pt]Preparation for autoing[/SIZE][/CENTER]</p>
<p>You will need to open two scar windows<br>
then open one official runescape window<br>
know visit my world switcher and open another window <a data-bbcode="true">HERE</a></p>
<p>It is vital that you DO NOT open two official runescape windows but one official and one from my site.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Your screen should know look something like this - </span></p>
<p><a href="http://imageshack.us" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img444.imageshack.us/img444/9089/pic16iv.png" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>NOTE - remember to open the “sender” script first and the “receiver” script after to allow you to start and stop the sender with ctrl+alt+r and ctrl+alt+s.</p>
<p>Your scar windows should look a bit like this -</p>
<p><a href="http://imageshack.us" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img275.imageshack.us/img275/5778/pic21es.png" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>Know you have completed this simply enter the data needed (usernames and pass and rock types) then click play on the receiver miner, do not worry about it doing anything because it will only do so once the sender has completed its first mining attempt.</p>
<p>Know bring the official runescape client to the front and press ctrl+alt+run <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>The reports will be something like this -</p>

<p>The script should set up, get the rock colors then switch clients do the same and mine in a loop. I hope you appreciate the ammount of work that i have put into these scripts and give me feedback to improve them. And please cech out my site or forums for antisipated updates and news - <a data-bbcode="true">HERE</a></p>
