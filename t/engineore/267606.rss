    <description>At the moment I am just going to call the project/idea EngineOre. This will possibly change as I didn&#39;t want to waste time thinking of a cool name.

I want to start by using rs2dv and have it load user data from a MySQL Database. This will give a foundation of a stable server and
won&#39;t have half of the useless code that is included in other servers which do not follow any conventions. I will look on more packed, unstable
server sources on examples of fighting methods and implement them into the server but by changing them slightly to make them 
efficient (less memory hogging), so they follow conventions and comment the code so that it has some features to start this project.

Okay so here is the idea:

It will be a PK server but not the normal just kill each other etc. It will be more strategized so that it is fair for all players. It will have a system
to get a percentage out of 100 of your current skill rating. Some things that will affect this rating will be your stats e.g.: {Attack, Defense and Strength},
but also player kills in conjunction will your win/lose ratio and some other things that I have not considered yet.

Because I am near the end of the term this will take longer as I have to consider assignments, exams etc. as I am taking fairly hectic subjects.
I will try keep this thread updated with my progress, errors and findings etc.

Please contribute any thoughts, constructive criticism, flame, or any ideas you have, as I would love to try get this to be a fun mini-game server rather
then just max your skills for the hell of it server.</description>

This is only because I don’t like I started using yz’s base but found I didn’t like the GUI but decided to get used to it. Yz’s base some small problems with logging in. It you have too small a username it won’t log in. And sometimes it refuses connection. But I have decided to use rs2dv and am working on making it save and load player data from a mysql database.</p>

              <p>At the moment I am just going to call the project/idea EngineOre. This will possibly change as I didn’t want to waste time thinking of a cool name.</p>
<p>I want to start by using rs2dv and have it load user data from a MySQL Database. This will give a foundation of a stable server and<br>
won’t have half of the useless code that is included in other servers which do not follow any conventions. I will look on more packed, unstable<br>
server sources on examples of fighting methods and implement them into the server but by changing them slightly to make them<br>
efficient (less memory hogging), so they follow conventions and comment the code so that it has some features to start this project.</p>
<p>Okay so here is the idea:</p>
<p>It will be a PK server but not the normal just kill each other etc. It will be more strategized so that it is fair for all players. It will have a system<br>
to get a percentage out of 100 of your current skill rating. Some things that will affect this rating will be your stats e.g.: {Attack, Defense and Strength},<br>
but also player kills in conjunction will your win/lose ratio and some other things that I have not considered yet.</p>
<p>Because I am near the end of the term this will take longer as I have to consider assignments, exams etc. as I am taking fairly hectic subjects.<br>
I will try keep this thread updated with my progress, errors and findings etc.</p>
<p>Please contribute any thoughts, constructive criticism, flame, or any ideas you have, as I would love to try get this to be a fun mini-game server rather<br>
then just max your skills for the hell of it server.</p>
