    <description>So far I&#39;ve only been able to connect to one server [out of about 20 that were online], and it only lasted like 5 minutes. Could someone please tell me if theres some obvious thing I need to change [i.e. something with my firewall]. I would really like some help.  :([br][size=1]Posted at: August 31, 2006, 04:51:09 PM[/size][hr]Come on people.. This forum is for helping [notice the title]. Everytime I try and connect I get &quot;Error connecting to server. Must be down.&quot;</description>
