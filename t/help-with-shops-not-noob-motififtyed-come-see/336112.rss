    <description>Alright this is what happend.
I went to make a PvP shop reward exchange.
I have it added into wannaeshop, and everything else needed for pvp thing.
I also have the coords down, and i have it selling with atlest a few items in it.
What happens when i go to trade the gem merchant.(What i used for pvp shop)
I dc.
Any idea&#39;s on how to fix?

No need for picture death, as what it says when i dc is 2 short.
