    <title>[508] Connecting to update server... Error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-connecting-to-update-server-error/469585</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve just made a switch from a 317 server to a 508 and every time I load the client the loading bar keeps getting stuck at &quot;Connecting to update server&quot; and gives me the js5 connect error. I&#39;ve been searching all over google to try and resolve this but everything says the same thing; I DID run the source first, I AM 100% port forwarded correctly, the client ip IS set to 127.0.0.1. But I still get the error for any server 508+. I was running my 317 fine then I turned the computer off to move it and turned it back on and now it wont run. I get &quot;Error connecting to server. Please try using a different world&quot; in the 317 now.. Can anybody help me? I&#39;ve been trying to fix this all day every day for the past week but nothing is working. also, I&#39;m a little new to running servers. I ran my 317 and coded it for about 3 weeks. So that being said, there might be something I missed? Please help.
