    <title>What is your worst injury?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-is-your-worst-injury/19784</link>
    <description>My worst injury would be...I damaged a tendon in my right ankle and I had to go under knife and to this day. When I roll my ankle, it clicks. Many people sit there and look at me... It&#39;s freaky. Oh well. It&#39;s funny, it&#39;s grose. I had a couple of pins put into my ankle.

This is off topic, but my friends worst injury.. I think a broken back. He wasn&#39;t paralyzed, he hurt the vertibrae that can paralyze you, but you can get away rom it. He got away from it and is back on the bike.</description>

<p>Fell backwards off a balcony at school and broke both my wrists in like the exact spot. To my suprise they heal’d quickly and it feels like it never happened.</p>
<p>Only other broken bones were toes, which heal on their own pretty much.</p>
<p>Got knocked out one time playing rugby last year, got a week of school since I had a really bad concussion. But other then that, no injuries that I can think of.</p>
