    <title>Okay i&#39;ve got my server running, but now i can&#39;t connect to it. :S</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/okay-ive-got-my-server-running-but-now-i-cant-connect-to-it-s/292211</link>
    <description>Finally the server works and after it started i thought, well it&#39;s all done right? Wrong! I ran the HD client and the server said reicived connection from 127.0.0.1. Then the load bar stops and it says error_game_js5io and thats it.. nothing. :/ It seems everything that can go wrong with setting up a server has gone wrong. But after this has been fixed it&#39;ll probs work. :D

Also if someone could tell me how to post pictures on here then i&#39;d show you.</description>
