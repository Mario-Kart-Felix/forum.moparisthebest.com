    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/weight-loss-and-muscle-growth/345231</link>
    <description>Uni and holiday is coming up soon, so I&#39;m aiming to lose as much weight as I can within 3 months. I have been working out a lot lately, and doing very little cardio so I want to switch this but I am not sure of the type of routine I should be doing/what foods I should be eating etc. 

I&#39;m 6ft tall, about 180 lbs with a big build. Ideally I&#39;d want to be more toned than thin looking. 

I am a member of a gym, with their main cardio machines being treadmills, crosstrainers, rowers, cycles, steps. I&#39;m up for going about 5 times a week, but just dont know what sort of routine I shoud follow.

Tips/advice please :)</description>

              <p>hmm, ok, so here’s my new lifestyle…</p>
<p>Monday - Arms (inc Shoulders), Chest and Back - Doing 4 sets of 12 rep squats<br>
Tuesday - 10 minute walk followed by a half hour jog followed by a half hour cycle<br>
Wednesday - Legs, abdominals and arms - Along with the squats<br>
Thursday - Cross trainer for 40 minutes, followed by a 25 minute row<br>
Friday - Chest, legs and back - with squats<br>
Sat - Rest<br>
Sun - Rest</p>
<p>Is this sort of weekly routine too much or is it ok? Each weight session I basically do most of the compound lifts and then focus on specific muscles doing around 4-5 sets on each.</p>
<p>My diet mainly consists of:<br>
Breakfast - Oats with milk and a banana<br>
Snack - Some sort of fruit<br>
Lunch - Brown rice with 2 poached eggs<br>
GYM SESSION<br>
Snack - Tuna sandwich, turkey sandwich, Oats with banana, some other protein rich foodage<br>
Dinner - Meat with new potatoes and vedgetables<br>
Snack - some sort of fruit again</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

              <p>Most people don’t actually do HIIT properly; they think they are, but at the end of the day they aren’t really putting in.<br>
Jogging isn’t that bad. Neither is something like cycling at a steady pace, for that matter.</p>
<p>Weight training is definitely the most important part though, and should come first. You absolutely need to be doing squats.<br>
I started out doing the Stronglifts 5x5 program for beginners, but found that the rest time that was being used was too drawn out for my liking.<br>
I changed over to the 20 squats program (ie, one set with 20 squats in it); it fucks you up. You get to the 5th rep and you’re thinking “yeah, pretty easy – no dramas”. 5 reps later you’re starting to breathe heavy because of elevated heartrate. Once you hit rep 15, the final 5 reps can be a nightmare. Even though it’s only one set, you will definitely experience strength gains.<br>
After I do the squats, I then move to dips, chinsups/pullups, and pushups.</p>
<p>As for eating, you said you want to slim down. What I would do is convert your weight to pounds, multiply that by 16kCal, and then eat that amount minus 100 - 200 kCal to begin with. You want to reduce intake steadily so that your body isn’t shocked into a starvation response accidentally. Make sure you eat starchy carbs pre and post workout only.<br>
The downside with this is that muscular growth won’t happen (strength gains will though), and you might even feel a bit fatigued during workouts.<br>
You want to be eating at least 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight, too. There’s 4 kCal per gram of protein, 4kCal per gram of carbohydrates, and 9kCal per gram of fat.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the macronutrient ratio (Protein:Carbohydrates:Fat) 30:50:20 is a good starting point. Since you’re cutting, you might want to experience with carb cycling. Do a high carb day (30:50:20) and then a low carb day or two (45:30:25). On the law carb day, you might also want to lower the number of calories that you take in.<br>
The reality is that counting calories is completely unnecessary for fat loss, but if you want more bang for your buck then the clinical approach will deliver.</p>

              <p>Cardio isn’t a great way to lose weight unless you do HIIT. 10*200m with 2 mins recovery is a pretty intense session, do them at 30-37 seconds each depending on how fit you are but keep it consistent.</p>
<p>Doing weights and building muscle raises your base metabolic rate, which makes it easier to cut fat.</p>
<p>Get plenty of protein in so eggs, chicken, fish, nuts etc Eat whatever else as long as it’s healthy. Low in sugar and fat, and as least processed as possible.</p>
