Every server is a leech unless you get a blank source and add “everything” yourself and you guys probably have nothing better. So show what you got before you try to flame people on there work. Some people are new coder’s and they need help to better understanding Java… All you high rep people are just complete ass holes… You guys should show just a little respect it’s his first relase but there are no picture’s on Chaotic’s you should add some pictures of that. Remember to always use proper English too… Because flamer’s love to pound you on your grammar I don’t know why… O.o Must get them off or something.

<p>To me, a leach is downloading a source and not doing much with it.  An example would be 40% of the servers on status pages, there leachs of hybrid-pvp or some shit, all they did was change the home, name, ect, and they say they added it all, when they don’t know shit about what their using.  All he did was add a few models and fix a few bugs, not even worthy of a release.  I know several 200 reppers that are highly respectable.  If people don’t think it’s worthy of praise, we don’t give it praise.  Patting them on the head and saying “goodjob” for everything they do won’t get them anywhere.[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s generally the same at my point of view, but I also think of a leech that they dl a source and do nothing at all to it except change the names.</p>

<p>You clearly have no idea what a leech is. Here I’ll give you a nice definition: A leech is re-releasing someones work without doing anything to it but changing the names and doing little to nothing to it.</p>
<p>I’ve looked through this source and the other cammypvp and this one had a few more bugs fixed.</p>
<p>Thus he did do work on it.<br>
[/quote]<br>
No. Look at the credits. He’s claiming he did more than half the work, when all he did was move the home and fix some bugs. If he’s taking way more credit than he deserves, it’s considerably a leech.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well in that case, then the credits should be more like 75% to whoever made cammy pvp and 25% for him.</p>

<p>Golly, that must mean it isn’t a leech![/quote]</p>
<p>You clearly have no idea what a leech is. Here I’ll give you a nice definition: A leech is re-releasing someones work without doing anything to it but changing the names and doing little to nothing to it.</p>
<p>I’ve looked through this source and the other cammypvp and this one had a few more bugs fixed.</p>
<p>Thus he did do work on it.</p>

Some people are new coder’s and they need help to better understanding Java… All you high rep people are just complete ass holes… You guys should show just a little respect it’s his first relase but there are no picture’s on Chaotic’s you should add some pictures of that. Remember to always use proper English too… Because flamer’s love to pound you on your grammar I don’t know why… O.o Must get them off or something.

if (absX &gt;= 2730 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 2731 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 3497 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 3490) {</p>
<pre><code>                            return true;
		} else {
			return false;
