Working on the design for an application/website aimed at organizing and showcasing events that you, and your friends attend. 

I&#39;d would love some feedback for the idea. I&#39;m kinda sad that there isn&#39;t an application development section of the forum, I would have posted there.

Rundown:

At a concert, have this application installed, get an invite to join the concert group, upload photos/videos/text, all gets saved to your profile.

It can be compared to Facebook photoalbums but I feel the nature of the application/service is less personal and more fun like Tumblr/Instagram. There&#39;s a few other unmentioned features.</description>
