    <title>Just Getting This Out There</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/just-getting-this-out-there/331812</link>
    <description>It can be done, it has been done. This was taken earlier this morning. I&#39;ve spent the last 9 or 10 months working on this, there&#39;s lots of issues that need to be addressed, and this is only the second time I was able to get a script that logged in and completed at least one command smoothly—enough. Just getting this script alone to work took an all-nighter since I knew I was on the verge of some mild success.

You can, lol! This bug has been around awhile, pity you, the community, only just find these. Here’s a freebie: You can use warps from a distance… By warps I mean stairs etc. You just need a certain few things activated on your character… Oh, and when you use the warp, it will telport you to your current x/y, 1 story above or below you… Sooo, you can essentially get inside the locked compartments in varrock bank; no joke. By being around a long time, I mean think back… A WIDELY abused bug was the dance-teleport… It’s essentially the same with new means.<br>
[/quote]maybe you should move on from rsc and early rs2 :/[/quote]</p>
<p>And current rs2, and I have, yay for WoW</p>

<p>Also by the way you’ve been talking and the lack of code you’ve shown im quite inclined to think this could even be some retarded troll / fake. Anyway what do I care…</p>
