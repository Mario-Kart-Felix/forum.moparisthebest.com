    <description>I went to download SCAR 2.03 from Freedy1990.com and my avast goes crazy and start giving me errors? Is it because its a macro program? Or is it really a virus?</description>

              <p>On the off chance you didn’t detect the thinly veiled sarcasm, no it’s not a trojan. Scar divi is used by a lot of people who have had no issues but if you don’t trust it, don’t use it.</p>

              <p>It’s a virus. We’ve been using SCAR for years but we recently found out that the creators were devious. Their plans were to lure us with freedom from RuneScape with the benefits of an active player through macroing. Once they got us to download their program and use their scripts, we grew less addicted to RuneScape but more addicted to SCAR.</p>
<p>That’s when they updated the program to SCAR Divi back in 2007 and a little logger called SCARLog was attached with it. We thought it would just keep track of our macroing habits and create cool, little stats signatures that could be placed as your forum signature. What a horrible mistake. Our accounts got stolen all at once. I heard it was around 65,535 accounts that’s 2^16 - 1 bits. It was an interesting number to many but was hilarious to the evil programmers.</p>
<p>Once they had those accounts, they used a program to login to their name on the website, change their passwords, recovery questions and answers. They also developed a macro program which would log each account in, take in anything of value from the Falador East bank and bring it to a character named F K Hurt. People thought it meant <span class="bbcode-b">Fuck Pain</span> but what it really stood for was Freddy Kaitnieks (the creators of SCAR) and Hurt which symbolizes their infamous program SCAR.</p>
<p>After everyone was robbed of their macroing accounts. Jagex showed no mercy. Since they were macroing accounts and since they had 0 value because they grew by cheating, they were deleted. Immediately in a mass ban. People who made money from selling millions of gp and others who put sentimental value on their workers were SOL. The forums of Kaitnieks were flooded that Kait decided to leave. He didn’t talk to anyone on MSN except his buddy Freddy. They signed a deal where Freddy paid him 255 Euros for a hooker and Freddy was the new owner of SCAR.</p>
<p>This is where we stand now. Be careful of SCAR.</p>
