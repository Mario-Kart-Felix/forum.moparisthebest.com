    <description>Hello, Everytime I sell something to a store I get &quot;connection lost&quot; and sure enough it reloads, but its annoying and a waist of time.. That also brings me to my other question. My general store wont let me sellf every item I should. Such as a dark bow or a godsword, why not? PLEASE HELP![br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 30, 2009, 01:33:11 pm[/size][hr]*Bump*</description>
