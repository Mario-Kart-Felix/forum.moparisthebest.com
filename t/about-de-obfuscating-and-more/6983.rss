    <description>[center][size=20pt]About: (De)Obfuscating and more![/center]

[u]Introduction:[/u]
Ok, since I&#39;ve seen some threads in the Java/Aryan section about either ressurecting Aryan and/or making a new kind of bot. I just thought I would clearify the situation for all the people that do not know that it is extremely hard to do this.

Table of contents:

[ul][*]How does Runescape work?
[*]How does Aryan work?
[*]What&#39;s obfuscating/deobfuscating?
[*]Ending word/Conclusion.[/ul]


[u]How does Runescape work?[/u]
Runescape is a MMORPG and works by the [i]client - server enviroment[/i]. This can be compared to IRC, you have a client in which you can connect to a server and chat with other clients.
In this case, the server doesn&#39;t only function as a &quot;meeting place&quot; for the users. It also functions like a verifier. For example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;USER:[i]Hello bank. I would like to withdraw my 10 party hat sets please.[/i]
SERVER:[i]Please wait, checking...[/i]
SERVER:[i]Shut up! You don&#39;t even have 10 party hat sets![/i]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Without this verifier, it WOULD be possible to actually &quot;create&quot; items.

[IMG]http://img221.imageshack.us/img221/1410/serverclientforumur3.png[/img]

Server = Runescape server (Worlds)
R/C = Runescape Client
Lines = Connections


In the pic above, you see the client that connects to the server. You can see there&#39;s two components but actually there are 3:
1: The user
2: The client
3: The server

Here&#39;s how it works. You send a command to the Java app, for example, you click a tree. The client recieves the mouse click and parses it, this code gets send to the server, the server verifies it and if correct, approves it and sends it back:

[IMG]http://img221.imageshack.us/img221/6995/clientservforumvt5.png[/img]

First block = User
Second Block = Client


[u]How does Aryan work?[/u]
So, now we know that the client send commands and the server verifies this, so let&#39;s get on with the working of Aryan.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Q: [i]What is Aryan?[/i]
A: [i]Aryan is a JAVA extend to the client for the automation of tasks in Runescape.[/i]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Basicly, you could see Aryan as a Runescape client with a &quot;tool&quot;. A sort of expansion to the client. A expansion that kind of &quot;deletes&quot; the user in my 3 base story (see above). Only this user does the clicks without you there

&lt;blockquote&gt;Q: [i]If Aryan replaces the clicks, how could it be detected?[/i]
A: [i]Well, in the beginning Jagex based the autoing behavior on stuff like: suspicious movement, default clothing, default names, default level.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So again, let&#39;s clearify this with a picture:

[IMG]http://img139.imageshack.us/img139/7756/aryanclientservkh3.png[/img]

Blue block = Client
Red &quot;wrapping&quot; block = Aryan


So after seeing this picture we know that Aryan sends parsed commands (packets) and does NOT click. It &quot;simulates&quot; it.

[u]What&#39;s Obfuscation/Deobfucation[/u]
This is a pretty simple thing actually, if you have programmed in Java, you know that in order to get your code to work you need:

1: The code.
2: Compile it(converting it to bytecode so that the computer can read it).
3:Run it(with the java virtual machine).

Ok, so when you make lets say a file to say: Hello World! you would make:
[code]
public class YourFileName
{
       public static void main(String[] args)
       {
             System.out.print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
       }
}
[/code]
Erm yeah, not the most neat code (I&#39;m used to Textpad) but it will serve for the purpose of example. So when you save it you&#39;ll make a YourFileName.java on the computer. Now, before you can use it, it needs to be compiled, so when you compile it it rams out code for the machine. This file is called YourFileName.class.

You&#39;re wondering, so what? What&#39;s obfuscating and deobfuscating then? Well, there are program (like Mocha) that can decompile the .class file into the .java file again that&#39;s reverse engineering.

But some programmers (like Jagex) don&#39;t want people to see their source code and so they use a obfuscator. This is basicly a encrypter. So that programs like Mocha can&#39;t reverse engineer it&#39;s source. This method of protection is called [b]obfuscating[/b].

So you can actually guess what deobfuscating is, it&#39;s the reverse engineering of the obfuscated files. Actually de-encrypting the encrypted files. [b]Deobfuscating[/b].

[u]Ending word/Conclusion[/u]

So, some users still might be wondering what the problem is then? Well, Jagex uses a custom made obfuscator so it is extremely hard to get the files deobfuscated. So this means that we cannot get the source (atleast the .java files) of the Runescape clients anymore, which means we cannot make Java (Aryan like) bots because you need the updated client to run with the updated server.

[i]I hope this cleared some up, this guide isn&#39;t completely done, the grammar isn&#39;t checked, and I haven&#39;t explained some parts well enough. If you would like to comment, post here and do not message me.

<p>You really want me to put it in there instead of encrypting? This is a post for people who do not know alot about Java and just want to get a heads up on this stuff. I could however replace encrypting with scrambling since that is more close (obfuscators “scramble” the symbolic info right?).[br][size=1]Posted at: July 30, 2006, 06:17:06 PM[/size][hr][quote=“Pwnd, post:3, topic:6983”]And you can still make Java bots (Unlike Aryan) for Runescape ;D<br>

<p>Or a color clicker. It’s all simple but i stated clearly that we’re talking about Aryan like bots, who work as an extend to the client.</p>
