<p>And for hanging that baby over the balcony, it was because the crowd outside wanted to see the baby. So, what else could he do besides going outside and getting run over?<br>
He was also guilty of all 8 charges pressed against him for child molestation.</p>

<p>Michael Jackson didn’t bleach his skin. He was diagnosed with a disease called Vitiligo in 1986, which caused his skin to go white in ‘patches’ over time.</p>

              <p>All of these negative comments are really, really irritating me.</p>
<p>Micheal Jackson was, is, and forever will be a music icon who’s imprint on the industry shan’t be fading for a long, long time. Sure, he was a little weird in his later days, but that’s what not having a childhood does to you. Any psychiatrist will tell you that a lacking childhood leaves the adult striving to retrieve what they missed for the rest of their life, compound this with the fact that he spent a majority of his life hidden away, taking pills for his depression and anxiety (which were only caused by the media in the first place) which lead to an obsessive-compulsive, perfectionist attitude which can be speculated as his constant want for plastic surgery. And, of course, all of this plastic surgery had a permanent affect on his body, and put an extra load on his heart.</p>
<p>Micheal Jackson bleached his skin, why? Because, the nation was so discriminatory against blacks in the 80s that the young Jackson feared his career would never go anywhere. Micheal Jackson is a product of society, he changed himself to be what he believed we liked better, a sociological term known as The Looking Glass Self (Charles Horton Cooley, 1902). Anyone who criticizes the late Mr. Jackson is nothing but a lowlife hypocrite.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, Micheal Jackson.</p>
