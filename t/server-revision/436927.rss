    <title>Server Revision</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-revision/436927</link>
    <description>This is somewhat considered as help, because this poll will make my server development flow much more smoothly. Anyways, I want everyone&#39;s opinions on the revision of graphics (yes this involves the client but what the client offers revolves around the content added into the server). Would you rather see a server that features the whip and godsword era with some possible custom items or do you prefer a server that offers more new items like Dungeoneering Armor, Weapons, Etc. If you could please take a second to vote on the poll above and then post a comment discussing why you picked the choice. This will help me out greatly and I highly appreciate all of the feedback.</description>

<p>I agree, but of course I’m going to have to add content to keep the players from becoming bored and I will release some items, but the point I was trying to make was not just completely the items. Of course, I’m going to add fun, but yet defined customs that aren’t kiddish, and make the players want to log in and work for it, but I don’t think I should have all of the animations and bullshit.</p>

<p>If you add the content from RuneScape that was introduced at that moment in time, to the fullest extent, you won’t have to worry about additional content for quite a few years. I don’t see why everyone thinks they’ll run out of content on a 474, I could think of content to keep hundreds of players busy on a 317… Nonetheless, you’re the developer, you choose what you want. If you don’t want to recreate an older era of RuneScape, remix it, if you just want to become slap-happy and do what everyone else in the advertisement section is going for, have at it.</p>

<p>Kids nowadays want all those new custom shit yeah,<br>
unless you make the game fun and harder.<br>
e.g. Make only basic items for sale, and some what better ones like d2H, as pk shops or whatever your concept is.<br>
Better items like godswords ect… could be obtained in shards with low drop rates.<br>
Improve your barrows minigames so it takes longer and lower chances on good items ect…<br>
This keeps the will to get good items for the players,</p>
<p>when you just add a bunch of customs in the shops, that obviously what they want to have<br>
especially when your economy sucks and everyone walks around with it</p>
<p>edit:<br>
It all depends on you on what you do with the gameplay itself</p>

634, although some of the shit in 634 is bad theres a reason why its there… For Rs to evolve, staying stuck at one point is boring. You want to evolve your Rsps, nobody says evolve it like Rs does. Rs has the potential to be bigger if it reworks whats its made, thats why they reworked(but failed at it)  things did you notice a different set of players joined? Thats why, it evolved. Don’t focus neccasairly on what revision it is but what content your going to add. I say 634 as it looks nicer to me and your not restricted as much. Nobody says you have to use all the items etc ofc but its there if you want to use it(:.</p>
