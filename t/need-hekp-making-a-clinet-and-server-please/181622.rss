    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-hekp-making-a-clinet-and-server-please/181622</link>
    <description>Hello,

I need people who no how to program games, or make servers, etc.
I am looking for about 2-5 people on this project please.

I would like the Client to be called PkScape, and i would NOT like it to be like all of the other clients.
The way i would like to change it would be buy only making: 1 bank next to a wilderness (1v1 and All vs. All)
So it is basically the title ( PkScape). If possable i would still like it to have all of the items that the other clients have. ( Including SKill cape and dark bow etc.)
