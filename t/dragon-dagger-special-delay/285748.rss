    <title>Dragon Dagger Special Delay</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dragon-dagger-special-delay/285748</link>
    <description>Hello, I am using a variant of Allstarscape V2 and on the dragon dagger special, the hands move as normal(over and back again) but the red trail lags about one to two seconds behind the hands. Here is  the code I have for it. I have tried editing everything to fix the trails but I do not know anything else to change. All help is appreciated.

[code]   public void DDSSpecial() {
        if (IsAttackingNPC &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 5698) {
            setAnimation(0x426);
            actionTimer = 4;
            SpecDamgNPC(31);
            DDS2Damg = true;
            DDStimer = 0;
            resetAnimation();
            teleportToX = absX;
            teleportToY = absY;
            SpecDamgNPC(31);
            SpecialDelay = 0;[/code][br][br][size=1]Posted on: June 27, 2009, 11:52:29 am[/size][hr]Does anyone know a fix to this?? This has been a problem of mine for over a year, and if anyone has an answer it would be greatly appreciated.</description>
