[b]Updates[/b]
[url=http://karamja.net/index.php?topic=34.0]Dedicated thread[/url] 

[b]IRC[/b]
Server: irc.rizon.net(for those of you on webclients just select rizon)
Port: 6667(that&#39;s the default)
Channel: #KaramjaRSC
[b]Quick link to IRC Channel:[/b]
https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.rizon.net/#karamjarsc

[b]Account Safety[/b]
Your passwords should be stupid and not used on multiple websites. Please use a unique password for the game so that way you don&#39;t get hacked. If you do use a bot and you are hacked... we don&#39;t do anything. Keep your characters safe. 

[b]Server Hosting[/b]
The RSC server is being hosted on a $20 box. It should hold 100 people just fine, if not we can look at spending a little extra but would like to keep costs minimal. We have had players from Europe, USA, and New Zealand say that the latency is fine

[b]DDOS[/b]
Every server faces it, we will as well. We won&#39;t bother to &#39;fight&#39; them as there isn&#39;t much we can do. Maybe we will toss up another $20 vps for our trusted members so we can continue it privately. If not we just wait till it&#39;s done. 

[b]Roll Backs[/b]
Roll backs will eventually happen. The damage done will be minimal since the server saves profiles every x amount of minutes. You can also log out to save your profile as well. We will not be reimbursing exp for the server crashing due to ddos or other related incidents

[b]Subscriptions[/b] 
Really have been against this ever since I have been in the RSC private server community. Then I am kind of thinking about doing it so that way it could help fund some RSC utility projects such as cache related editors. I am not sure yet, something to debate. Right now we will not be taking subscriptions. 

[b]Bots[/b]
We all have botted. Don&#39;t bullshit me, don&#39;t bullshit yourself. If this was a 1x exp rate replica I would probably turn a cheek every now and again but this is not that type of server. Botting will legitimately ruin the server. The server is designed to work together as a team. You&#39;re not going to feel that sense of accomplishment if you or a team member is using a bot. So if you see it, let an administrator know. If the server does get to the point where it&#39;s just a bot contest we will shut it down and move on to another project.

[b]Seasons[/b]
Karamja RSC is going to take on a topshift approach and have a season last x months. After x months everything will be wiped and your accounts will be awarded accordingly. When a new season begins you can choose a different team. Awards will be for players not team related so you can take those bonuses to another team if you wish to do so :)

[b]Team Fairness[/b]
What happened during the beta is everyone wants to join Zamorak because they have 5000 kills while Guthix has 300 and Sara 100. If this happens during the season I will be forced to close off registration to the team that has all the players and give the 2 other teams some form of perks so that the field is even.

I encourage you all to be fair about it because it&#39;s only going to be fun if we allow ourselves to diversify and take on the challenge of being on a team that is behind.

[b]Team Upgrades[/b]
Killing an npc gives your team points. Use points to unlock neat features for your team. View the upgrades and costs here : http://karamja.net/index.php?topic=28.0 
You can view your points in game via ::points or on the top of the webpage classic.karamja.net

[b]Rangers[/b]
Ability to range from a far distance (12 tiles)
Unique items and armors will be released sometime in April - Which will include cannons

[b]Wizards[/b]
The ability to cast spells. Will be more like utility / supporter players. The custom wizard spell packs will be released sometime in April!

[b]Warriors[/b]
Masters of melee.
Turn into the size of Firegiants when berserker mode is activated

[b]Other Class System Information[/b]
Rangers and Wizards can melee but their exp is 1/2. Do keep in mind you won&#39;t be able to use 2h swords, long swords or battle axes when we do get around to item wielding. Warriors will have unique bonuses and really are the master of the sword so don&#39;t bother hybriding or you will get owned. Use your class to your advantage! Each one has it&#39;s own unique perks.

[b]Landscape[/b]
The game is based around karamja with additional custom land and dungeons.</description>

<p>i believe that the drop system needs to be scrapped as is and replaced all together buying bones from shops is terrible the cost of a d bone goes up to 2k each after u buy like 20 not to mention that 500 total in the server at any one time is just bad</p>
<p>the drop system is actually a way to keep players playing people camp at bosses and kill them all day long for GOOD DROPS having everything drop the same shit besides the amount of gp isnt going to help that because everyone who trained their guys on theives have all the drops the fire giants drop already</p>

<p>Yes I ran into finals which are far more important because I get paid to go to school so I have to feed myself first <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> My bad.</p>
<blockquote>-alot of this seems unfinished and a lack of updates really makes it seem almost abandoned ie. d stones cant make d ammys, missing stairs and ladders requiring ::stuck command</blockquote>
<p>I don’t have much to say here because combat abilities are still being worked out with items and the last thing I want is for everyone to burn up d stones when they could be used for d bolts etc etc. But yea, I get the point.</p>
<blockquote>-vials need to be in shops it takes me longer to make a vial then it does to mine and make a rune bar or cut and string a magic long</blockquote>
I know this isn't real rsc but time is valuable, thus potions become extremely valuable with that model.
<blockquote>-char choices are cool but allow my main to do spells like alching, bones to bananas , smelt ore , enchant ammys and not combat spells</blockquote>
I will fix this xD
<blockquote>-guthix was stacked due to it being the default choice (an update disabling guthix was promised but never came)</blockquote>
You can ask anyone who played, all teams were disabled and enabled based on popularity....
<blockquote>-your site has been down for almost a week and your game has been down for 3 days </blockquote>
The sites up, I just haven't bothered to post the directory while we continue to work on it. The server has been up and down due to nonsense attacks. I check it multiple times a day :)
<blockquote>-drop system is garbage and so is prayer due to that drop system</blockquote>
Prayer is going to have a rs2 implementation for training on altars and you can buy all the bones from the general store.
<blockquote>-shop system should not be joined up how it is leave each teams shops individual</blockquote>
???
<p>again theres alot going for this server</p>
<blockquote>-the team system with home spawns is an idea thats fresh and innovative however i think u needed a custom landscape to make this work out better</blockquote>
A lot of players never actually visited the members end of karamja, but I would agree.
<blockquote>-team banks are a great idea but i think they need to be better secured such as individual clan banks within the team and u can tell who took out item. team banks failed because we all feared someone would just make an account and get an orb take our stuff to another team</blockquote>
I log the transactions, I guess I can make them public :)
<blockquote>-the ranged system works very well i like the fact that a ranger can actually be effective alone</blockquote>
Which is another reason updates are iffy and sometimes not released due to balancing of the combat triangle but cannons and dragon hide armour still in the mix :)
<blockquote>-batched works well where it has been done could use work in fletch smithing vialing</blockquote>
Shall do :)
<p>Lets also not forget that Karamja has produced content that won’t be seen again, except for the RSCR skill capes poll, they can copy <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
In all honesty Karamja is an experiment, every time you push non rsc content on rscers they all freak. Just have to ignore it and keep the experiment going.</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback.</p>

Man, you’re delusional.  We were around for over 6 months.  Player count didn’t fall off till the last month and a half… You didn’t even make it a month and a half of having an active server.  Lol. Its all good though, the $$$/player count/the fact you’ve had about 4 or 5 new in game character registrations in the last 2 weeks speaks for itself.</p>
<p>Nothing else needs to be said.  This server was a huge failure, congrats on failing miserably.  Not like people actually check out this thread, but if people actually want a real rsc private server, check out RSCR.</p>
<p>Bye rodger! You can now circlejerk with your 1 or 2 butt buddies alone in this topic without me coming in to remind you how hard you’ve failed!</p>
<p>Also, pretty funny how you tried to get cirnopk’s topic closed… Here we are 3 weeks later and its still open.  Just shows how people completely ignore your irrelevant ass.  Another addition to your long list of failures!</p>
