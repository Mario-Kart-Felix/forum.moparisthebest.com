<p>Because something shouldn’t be announced and then barely anything happens for the next 7-10 or whatever months… If he was doing something from scratch then fine, but it’s a slightly edited RSCA source with zero new content, there’s really no excuse for it to take this long.</p>

</aside>
<p>How I knew you would tackle it… brb announcing new Halo game or xBox… gonna take 2 years to come out. Nothing wrong with announcing moparrsc. He has shown interest which is the overall point. Instead of having servers go on and offline, dirty administrators etc etc we can finally see some light for community and put the source code in the right hands. Mitb offers stability, hes not money oriented (hes fair), and a crowd. What do you have on mitb that you can offer, that he can’t?</p>
<p>If you can give me some legitimate reasons I will be all for playing rscdaemon…</p>
<p><span class="mention">@CFF</span> comment… which is arguably a different project on its own.</p>

</aside>
<p>Honestly, I’m not a fan of luke because he deleted my accounts on RSCE multiple times, and just recently did again but:</p>
<p>Luke is motivated and dedicated to RSC for some reason. MITB isn’t. MITB doesn’t even know what runescape Classic is, honestly. The guy was\is a complete tool when it comes to RSC.</p>
<p>Luke knows how to run a business and he clearly is the most successful RSC owner, ever. If he wants something done, it usually happens. I don’t give a fuck if he asked people to DDOS or not, he has been here since day 1 and hasn’t went anywhere. Everyone has left after 1 big of struggle, MITB did, Like your down syndrome ass did, like I did, like xEnt has 100x, like codeforfame has 100x, like Reines did, like everyone else did. You can’t hate on Luke, end of story.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>i don’t agree that Luke is the most successful RSC owner ever, sure hes right up the top with others, but in my opinion he’s only had it running for so long because hes unchallenged, nobody has bothered to even come near and compete, hes had it quite lucky imo.</p>
<p>but i do agree that hes motivated and knows how to run a business model. To me he’s everything that’s great in a server admin except 1 thing (which is money) but you’ll never get a mr perfect.<br>
[/quote]<br>
He is unchallenged for a reason retard. Because no1 wants to challenge something that’s impossible to compete. You’ve came out with 4-5servers when RSCE has been up. Codeforfame has. THE main RSC site has tried to come out with a RSC SITE, all failed. ALL the top coders have, and they all failed. So, how I don’t get it?</p>
<p>And Money comes with success, you can’t avoid it. If you’re successful, you get money.</p>
<p>And if you don’t think Luke is hte most sucessfull owner ever then you’re just a complete ignorant fucking tool.</p>
<p>Longest Running, most money made, most updates. What more can someone do? IDGI[/quote]</p>

<p>Honestly, I’m not a fan of luke because he deleted my accounts on RSCE multiple times, and just recently did again but:</p>
<p>Luke is motivated and dedicated to RSC for some reason. MITB isn’t. MITB doesn’t even know what runescape Classic is, honestly. The guy was\is a complete tool when it comes to RSC.</p>
<p>Luke knows how to run a business and he clearly is the most successful RSC owner, ever. If he wants something done, it usually happens. I don’t give a fuck if he asked people to DDOS or not, he has been here since day 1 and hasn’t went anywhere. Everyone has left after 1 big of struggle, MITB did, Like your down syndrome ass did, like I did, like xEnt has 100x, like codeforfame has 100x, like Reines did, like everyone else did. You can’t hate on Luke, end of story.<br>
[/quote]Like I have 100x?  Whenever I leave it’s because it’s going to fail, and there isn’t anything that can be done about it.  Also, I left PP2P for obvious reasons, I left RSCLive or w/e for obvious reasons, and that’s pretty much it…</p>
<p>The only other projects were RSCBase and MoparClassic.  RSCBase is still something I’d like to do, I just don’t have that much time these days, and it’s a shitload of work.  I’m also still working on MoparClassic, and it’s been something like 8 months.</p>
<p>So, where are these other 98 times coming from?</p>

<p>i don’t agree that Luke is the most successful RSC owner ever, sure hes right up the top with others, but in my opinion he’s only had it running for so long because hes unchallenged, nobody has bothered to even come near and compete, hes had it quite lucky imo.</p>
<p>but i do agree that hes motivated and knows how to run a business model. To me he’s everything that’s great in a server admin except 1 thing (which is money) but you’ll never get a mr perfect.<br>
[/quote]<br>
He is unchallenged for a reason retard. Because no1 wants to challenge something that’s impossible to compete. You’ve came out with 4-5servers when RSCE has been up. Codeforfame has. THE main RSC site has tried to come out with a RSC SITE, all failed. ALL the top coders have, and they all failed. So, how I don’t get it?</p>
<p>And Money comes with success, you can’t avoid it. If you’re successful, you get money.</p>
<p>And if you don’t think Luke is hte most sucessfull owner ever then you’re just a complete ignorant fucking tool.</p>
<p>Longest Running, most money made, most updates. What more can someone do? IDGI[/quote]I haven’t come out with a server, ever.  I’ve only joined other projects after they were started, and implemented their ideas.  Get your shit straight.</p>

        <p>[quote=“NoLives, post:125, topic:422438”]The fact that rumors go around about what you do with your money.<br>
Rumors dont start from nothing.[/quote]<br>
I’m entitled to do whatever I want with my money, just like you are, just like everyone else reading this is…</p>
<p>And rumours can start from nothing; I’ve never attacked a server but as soon as DDoS is mentioned the majority blame me.</p>
<p>All this is irrelevant anyway, either you will play our new server or you won’t… Either way the majority will. I’ve learnt a lot throughout approaching 3 years of administration and yes I’ve made mistakes but I’d like a second go at it with a fresh slate. Those mistakes won’t be made again and I will ignore any personal grudges to give everyone the start over.</p>
<p>Zilent and I are doing this because we want to bring the community together. Although RSCEmulation is by far the biggest we believe there’s a lot more players out there that would prefer something different, including a large percentage of the RSCEmulation players, and we believe we’re in a position to offer that.</p>
<p>If you’re not interested then simply move along to another thread. There’s really no reason to bring hatred and flame into this.</p>

I really don’t see how it’s any different from anyone who sold subscriptions, such as Reines, KO9, yourself, etc. The only difference is the amount of them being sold and how lolng they’ve been selling for.

Get over it. There is only so much you can do with the income. It’s a Runescape server, not like he can really invest into anything with it.

<p>+1 to this. Maybe you crybabies should try finding your own way to make money (maybe getting a degree and a career) instead of sitting in the basement being mad at other people who have found ways.</p>
