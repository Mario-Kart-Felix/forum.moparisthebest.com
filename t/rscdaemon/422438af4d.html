        <p>I really don’t see what’s complicated about this.</p>
<p>RSCE started as non-profit, that was before I realised that I’d be spending thousands every single month to stay online and functioning. In the end we had no choice but to introduce subscriptions to pay for out goings. Around that period we grew a lot and more subscriptions were being sold than what was needed (at that time) to stay online. I published a poll asking if we should cap subscription sales so once a certain amount has been generated you can no longer buy them until the next more or just allow them to be bought constantly. Near enough the entire community went for the latter.</p>
<p>Last year when we were seeing 300-400 online most nights we made far more than before and after so I started experimenting with paid advertising including wasting £5,000 on Facebook advertising. Note the wasted part. I now honestly see paid advertising on those sort of sites a waste of time, along with Google and other big ad suppliers. The only form of advertising that is worth going for now is on other RS related sites, such as cheating sites, private servers, top-lists, etc. This is a very specific area though and all the big WoW/RS2 private servers can afford to pay a LOT more than we can.</p>
<p>I really don’t see how it’s fraud. Every single person that buys a subscription knows the process completely and knows exactly what they’re buying or they wouldn’t do it and without them we wouldn’t have been online for 2 years and 5 months…</p>
<p>If you want to flame me for that then fine but it’s absolutely no different from any other server that sold subscriptions (most of them) which includes Reines’ RSCD, KO9’s RSCAngel, the numerous RSCDevil attempts, all of Pomp’s attempts and so on. I really don’t see why I’m the one being flamed when the only difference is I’ve stuck around.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Kryptix, post:86, topic:422438”]I really don’t see what’s complicated about this.</p>
<p>RSCE started as non-profit, that was before I realised that I’d be spending thousands every single month to stay online and functioning. In the end we had no choice but to introduce subscriptions to pay for out goings. Around that period we grew a lot and more subscriptions were being sold than what was needed (at that time) to stay online. I published a poll asking if we should cap subscription sales so once a certain amount has been generated you can no longer buy them until the next more or just allow them to be bought constantly. Near enough the entire community went for the latter.</p>
<p>Last year when we were seeing 300-400 online most nights we made far more than before and after so I started experimenting with paid advertising including wasting £5,000 on Facebook advertising. Note the wasted part. I now honestly see paid advertising on those sort of sites a waste of time, along with Google and other big ad suppliers. The only form of advertising that is worth going for now is on other RS related sites, such as cheating sites, private servers, top-lists, etc. This is a very specific area though and all the big WoW/RS2 private servers can afford to pay a LOT more than we can.</p>
<p>I really don’t see how it’s fraud. Every single person that buys a subscription knows the process completely and knows exactly what they’re buying or they wouldn’t do it and without them we wouldn’t have been online for 2 years and 5 months…</p>
<p>If you want to flame me for that then fine but it’s absolutely no different from any other server that sold subscriptions (most of them) which includes Reines’ RSCD, KO9’s RSCAngel, the numerous RSCDevil attempts, all of Pomp’s attempts and so on. I really don’t see why I’m the one being flamed when the only difference is I’ve stuck around.[/quote]Every single time you bring up the poll you conveniently forget to mention the option that said the additional profits will <span class="bbcode-b">only</span> be used on the server; not for pocketing, or buying random shit for yourself (to which you’ve admitted).</p>
<p>No one has ever had a problem with you taking donations (and rewarding people with subscriptions), and I don’t think you understand that.  The problem is that you’re misappropriating the funds that are for RSCE, not your personal use.</p>
<p>I guarantee if you listed everything you’ve used the donation money for people would be pissed and feel defrauded, because the entire basis for the formation of RSCE was because PP2P was pocketing the profits and spending it on his girlfriend, games, etc.</p>
<p>And don’t even try to pretend like you haven’t lied about the costs.  You and I both know it doesn’t cost you thousands of dollars a month for DDoS protection, even though you’ve publicly claimed that several times in order to get more donations.</p>

Zilent has never wanted any money and has repeatedly refused my offers of giving him any of the takings. He’s put hours, days, weeks and months into these projects and has never wanted a thing in return except for the recognition.</p>
<p>It was also his to start from scratch. He learnt a lot in his year and a bit break from the MMORPG world and came back eager to make a new base source instead of bodging and patching Reines’ RSCD. No matter how much we altered Reines’ RSCD it’s still RSCD.</p>
