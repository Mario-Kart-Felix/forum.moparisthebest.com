He just twisted the truth as he saw it fit.<br>
Facts were: the certer was removed after printz got 99 smithing.<br>
multiple ores was fixed after printz got 99 smithing.<br>

<p>That’s just one thing he was talking about and that’s ‘how we helped printz get 99 smithing’. Everyone benefited from those bugs, not just Printz. And that’s the fact.[/quote]</p>
<p>You’re still on my dick kid? Is your esophagus bruised yet? If you think that you didn’t give Printz and his little team of faggots an unfair edge you’re a straight liar. You let them all auto 24/7 in guild and banned anyone else who did. LOL. Then this little nerd gets mod , you have an agenda and you are supposedly a scammer. I didn’t make up you scamming sub money, someone else brought that up and yes I do believe because you’re a scumbag, you pop up with servers for a month open subs 2 days after they open and then close it ASAP. You’ve also been accused of stealing peoples CC information etc. It’s not all me, everyone except the fins hates you too. Go run another fail server with ‘Crooks’.</p>

              <p>Using the money that’s supposed to go into server development for DDOS-4-hire is enough to make a server fail.<br>
The fact that there are rumors, rumors don’t start out of nothing.<br>
When people have a choise between mopar or rsce, theres no doubt in my mind, every single person that isnt getting anything out of rsce will join mopar.<br>
Servers arent made out of sources, their made out of leadership.</p>
