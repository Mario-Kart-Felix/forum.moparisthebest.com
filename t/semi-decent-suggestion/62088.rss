    <title>Semi-Decent Suggestion!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/semi-decent-suggestion/62088</link>
    <description>Ok guys, as you all know there are many people who use hamachi, and many who don&#39;t.

I was thinking it would be VERY logical to add something small. It would be something that would go through a layout.

It would be the tag [HAM] or [No-HAM] in the topic subject.

One example:

[center][b][HAM] M0p4rsc4p3 Version 6![/b] [/center]

This would be for the server advertisement topics.

Please take this into consideration as it is very annoying clicking topics and finding out they are Hamachi.

Thanks alot!!
