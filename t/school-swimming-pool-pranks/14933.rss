    <title>School Swimming Pool Pranks</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/school-swimming-pool-pranks/14933</link>
    <description>first prank .. the most funny one.

I havent really tried it but you might want to experiment with it.
What you need is a school swimming pool if your school has one and ALOT of dye. 
First you mix up some dye if you havent (perferably blue or green because its hardly noticeable because of the pool water color)
Empty the dye into the pool (im not sure about the amount of dye you should put in it.)
Wait for people to swim in the pool and when they come out, their skin kind of looks blue and just LAUGH YOUR ASS OFF.
Empty the dye before swimming sessions or during swimming sessions if noones looking.

second prank .. wasting schools chlorine/time.

I have attempted this prank and it works, you may have to wait 2 - 3 days for the actual prank to work if they dont remove the ice
What you need is dry ice (any reasonable amount)
Throw dry ice into the swimming pool. Make sure NOONE looks because it will be too obivous lol.
People will think there is smoke or something is wrong and will evacuate. 
If the pool cleaners wait a few days and dont remove it, Algae will appear and the C02 dissolves in the water and feed the bugs real good. The cleaners will have to dump a ton of chlorine in it for a few days to kill it off. Thats the end of this prank.
