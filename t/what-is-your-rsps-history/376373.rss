    <title>What is YOUR rsps history?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-is-your-rsps-history/376373</link>
    <description>Tell me how you got into rsps and when.

Heres mine: In 2007 I was on Youtube with my older brother and we always saw people commenting &#39;Mopar, or morpha, ect, and we searched &#39;moparscape&#39; on youtube and there was a video of guys maxed out in dragon armor and barrows pking and swear words were uncensored so we laughed because it looked like runescape so we searched on the internet &#39;moparscape.com&#39; &#39;moparscape.net&#39; and everything else but we forgot .org so we were kinda disapointed that we couldn&#39;t play it because we wanted too. so the next day i searched moparisthebest.com and it worked, then we searched a how to play moparscape guide on youtube, and sure enough we were on a server, it was one of those millions of all star sources but this one was based in brimhaven so me and my brother thought it was more unique (this was before i knew about coding with java) and then it was shut down after about a couple months and we played more and more servers and sure enough it was my older brother who started playing runescape again and i grew more strong on rsps

Present: I am working on a couple projects for fun and my older brother moved on to xbox live</description>

<p>I’ve heard of that! there was actually a couple servers back then on that source</p>
<p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:14, topic:376373”]I feel like I’ve seen this type of thread before…</p>
<p>But anyway:</p>
<p>I started out a few years ago, a nerd with no knowledge of RS hacking at all. I didn’t even know it existed. Then one day, my neighbor (3 years younger than I, but we have a lot in common) showed me the MoparScape client, and how he was playing by himself, and he could spawn whatever items he wants.<br>
<span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">tl;dr</span> - My best friend neighbor introduced me to private servers.</span></p>
<p>I was intrigued. I started perusing over the forums, reading random tutorials and the like. I had never programmed before, besides some Visual Studio Visual Basic stuff (ps vb is shit), so this new Language was very foreign to me. I played one server for about a day, then decided that I wanted to make my own. (I don’t enjoy playing them nearly as much as I do putting work into them)<br>
<span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">tl;dr</span> - Java was new to me, but I decided I wanted to make my own server.</span></p>
<p>I downloaded a base (I don’t remember which) and tried to get it to work. I, like many others, had not port forwarded correctly. It was a week until I figured out that was the problem (not that I spent a lot of time on it during that week) When I finally got it to work, I had 20 players within the first day (ahh the times before golden servers) and we had a blast. It was called DavidScape 317. I was still very new to Java, so I considered almost anything I did a good accomplishment. I changed the hay bale defense training to a portal, and we had a party to celebrate that. I remember my main update was a beer keg that you clicked, and it would give you a beer. Then you could drink it and you would walk funny for a while.<br>
<span class="bbcode-i"> <span class="bbcode-b">tl;dr</span> - I started hosting DavidScape 317 (my first server) after some portforwarding troubles. There were plenty of players, but I still sucked at Java and my updates were pretty bad.</span></p>
<p>After hosting this server for a while, I discovered that there were more than one type of Private Server. I was hosting a 317, but there were more types! I started reading up on what they were, and immediately decided to switch to a 508. I gave my players a few days to download the new client, but I still lost about half of my playerbase on the switch. (If I knew as much as I do know, I would have written something to switch for them) The base I chose was Bulby, a run off of Palidino. This was probably the biggest mistake of my private server career. I did not know the stability flaws of Bulby at the time, and had I chosen a different base, DavidScape would probably have been a lot more popular than it turned out to be.<br>
<span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">tl;dr</span> - After a while, I switched to Bulby, and renamed my server DavidScape 508. I deeply regret that base choice because of its instability.</span></p>
<p>I started releasing my bases, even though at first they sucked. After taking a break and learning some real Java, I look back at even my latest DavidScape and I can see how unclean the code is. Over the months, I slowly started to fix some of the major problems of my unstable base. I fixed player resetting, and a lot of the connection issues. I even started adding good real updates that had never been seen in a RSPS to date.<br>
<span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">tl;dr</span> - I slowly improved my sources, and started releasing them.</span></p>
<p>Eventually, a few months ago, I shut down the hosted DavidScape 508. The player count was dwindling, and with the new status page, the chances of me ever getting a good number of players was low to none. I started learning more Java, and making programs not related to RSPS at all. It was fun. Now I’m getting ready to officially revive DavidScape, because I found one of the main stability issues. Hopefully this will allow me to keep a higher uptime, and use the status page properly. And this brings us to the present, where I am now hosting and administrating the official MoparScape Minecraft server.<br>
<span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">tl;dr</span> - I shut down DavidScape because the new Status Page was killing my player base. I moved further into Java for a few months, and now I am preparing to relaunch DavidScape (because it is more stable now) Right now, I am hosting the MoparScape Minecraft server.</span></p>
<p>Thank you for reading the Davidi2 autobiography.[/quote]</p>
<p>This is what i want to see! more people need to list this type of thing! long autobio’s of peoples rsps history! And I enjoyed reading this too, I may check out your ‘DavidScape’ :p, though im not a fan of minecraft</p>

<p>Heard of private servers in a comment on a video on YouTube back in 2006. Searched “runescape private server” with a friend on Google, and here I am today.</p>

              <p>When I was to get on RuneScape a lot in 2008, some friend told me MoparScape and how someone could cheat with it. I started asking a lot of questions about this, and so I started to attempt to get on the client which I didn’t know how to at all. So, I quit MoparScape (client) for at least a year. I came back, and I got the client to start working. I started to get on the client a couple of times, and then found out there was a status page on MoparScape. I started to get on other server’s.</p>
<p>In 2009, I didn’t bother with MoparScape or even registering. Nor do I bother to even host, or program a RSPS. So in 2010, which was in October was when I decided to join MoparScape and start to become some what known.</p>

              <p>Tell me how you got into rsps and when.</p>
<p>Heres mine: In 2007 I was on Youtube with my older brother and we always saw people commenting 'Mopar, or morpha, ect, and we searched ‘moparscape’ on youtube and there was a video of guys maxed out in dragon armor and barrows pking and swear words were uncensored so we laughed because it looked like runescape so we searched on the internet ‘<a href="http://moparscape.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparscape.com</a>’ ‘<a href="http://moparscape.net" rel="nofollow noopener">moparscape.net</a>’ and everything else but we forgot .org so we were kinda disapointed that we couldn’t play it because we wanted too. so the next day i searched <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> and it worked, then we searched a how to play moparscape guide on youtube, and sure enough we were on a server, it was one of those millions of all star sources but this one was based in brimhaven so me and my brother thought it was more unique (this was before i knew about coding with java) and then it was shut down after about a couple months and we played more and more servers and sure enough it was my older brother who started playing runescape again and i grew more strong on rsps</p>
<p>Present: I am working on a couple projects for fun and my older brother moved on to xbox live</p>
