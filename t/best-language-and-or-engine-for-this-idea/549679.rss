    <title>Best Language and/or Engine For This Idea</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/best-language-and-or-engine-for-this-idea/549679</link>
    <description>Alright, so what I&#39;m working on is a UI based, management style game. Going for a look similar to [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/70100/]Hacker Evolution[/url], currently I&#39;m using libGDX but the UI section of the API is really aggravating. Would I be better off using a native language? And if so, which one, because Java with Swing/AWT is a pain in the ass for these types of games alot of the time.</description>

              <p>I’m a regular user of Unity, got a couple of running projects in it. Hearthstone looks like it was clearly made with NGUI, however I don’t want to pay $90 for something like that. Of course NGUI was a big deal back before Unity 4.6 and the canvas system was released. In Unity 5 with all the canvas system this game idea would not be hard.</p>
<p>However, back when I was writing up some concepts for this game, it was planned to be a personal, open-source project. Something I could use with Git that doesn’t have a huge amount of overhead, something straight code.</p>

              <p>This would be pretty simple.<br>
Initiate the game tick.<br>
Jframe + panel for the canvas<br>
Abstract class for the game state<br>
Each class inherits the abstract and renders its relative UI and events to the screen<br>
Within the tick -&gt; if gamestate ==  -&gt; hack the taliban.<br>
Simple process but i think something like C# would be better for soemthing as form oriented as this.</p>

              <p>Swing is not the same thing as AWT. Swing is used to create GUI’s, but not game GUI’s (or anything really graphically unique). AWT on the other hand is going to be used in almost every java application that uses any sort of graphics whether it be through just drawing on a canvas or creating components that extend AWT components. You can totally just use AWT to make a game, it’d just be really time consuming to create your own engine.</p>
<p>As for libraries, have you looked at LWJGL?</p>

<p>If you’re using libGDX what does Swing or AWT have to do with it? Poor documentation has nothing to do with the language, that’s a developers fault. Have you looked into using a different library? You really shouldn’t be using swing at all, any sort of game graphics are going to be special canvas drawings that have nothing really to do with it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You misread my question. Currently the program is built with libGDX, but it’s not working out. I asked if just using native swing/awt would be a good idea, which you pointed out was not. Then I asked if there were any libraries anybody suggested, or maybe another language choice that has good native support.</p>
