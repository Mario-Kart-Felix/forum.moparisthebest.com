    <title>Working Flour Mill</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/working-flour-mill/448433</link>
    <description>I&#39;m making a rs 317 remake and i got the ladders for the flour mill working 100%. Now my only problem is the fact of getting the hopper to load the grain then press the hopper controls. Then change the  flour bin (1781) to show flour or to be able to use a pot on flour bin ether way would be perfect. I have seen a few methods on doing this but non that really explain how to make that method work. If someone will help me make the hopper load and use controls to make the pot fill with the bin i can do the rest. Even if its not showing me code but at least a place to start making it work. The other methods have said use grain on hopper flour = 0 make if flour = 1 then use controls then make if flour = 2 and then make pot on bin if flour = 2 but i just need a place to put it i understand the working just not the place nor making it add to player.</description>
