    <title>My 718 Client Won&#39;t Load</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-718-client-wont-load/453943</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been trying for the past 2 hours to try to get a client for my friends server up for him and when we go to run the client it won&#39;t load  I tried all of the following
No-ip, my real IP, and my localhost IP, and NONE of them worked, when I ran the client, it just stayed at &quot;Checking for updates 0%&quot;

I also get this in the command prompt when I run the client!
&quot;error_game_js5connect&quot;

The Server is online and its loaded and the client will not work still!

Can somebody please help me out here! Please Much needed</description>
