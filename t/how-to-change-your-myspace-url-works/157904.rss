When you first signup And choose your URL, it says that it never changeable. LIES!!!!! Send this message to the support system. This really works. But It does take them a month to reply to your message... So send this message to them
&lt;blockquote&gt;is there any way possibly to change my URL address. Because
 my parents want me to change it but i don&#39;t want to deal
with having to send all those new friend requests and stuff,
and i&#39;m a leader of a group that i know soon will be like 25
people. so please could you make it happen some how?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This really works. So have fun with it i guess.</description>
