    <title>How do you change the speed a spell is cast?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-you-change-the-speed-a-spell-is-cast/316348</link>
    <description>im having trouble changing the speed of a few spells specifically ice barrage. it casts as fast as you can click it and id like it to have some time between casts. ive had trouble finding what place to look and the only stuff on it i found is a // barrage created using bakatool 
or something like that. does anyone have any suggestions?</description>
