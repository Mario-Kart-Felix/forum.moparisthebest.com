    <title>Hopefully someone can help me. Probably a simple problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hopefully-someone-can-help-me-probably-a-simple-problem/469560</link>
    <description>Well, I coded servers years back and needless to say, I&#39;ve forgotten some things. 
I&#39;m trying to set my environmental variables, however I don&#39;t have a classpath variable.  I have the path one, but classpath is no where to be found.  Should I create one, or what should I do?  Every time I try and run it says &quot;the system cannot specify the path&quot; and I know this is the issue, but again theres no classpath in my environmental variables.

I should probably note that I am running a virtual machine (On a mac computer, running windows 7 iso).  Is that the reason why?  Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks

Edit:  I should also note that I did try adding a classpath under system variables myself but that doesn&#39;t seem to be helping.</description>
