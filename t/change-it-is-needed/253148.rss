    <description>Quite a few of us, as you would describe &quot;Elitists&quot; are sick of the shit that is being handed to us on a silver platter by the administration team, a few of us hold staff positions on this site, how ever low on the scale they are our opinions should matter.

The pressing issue that is occuring at this moment in time is the constant fued back and forth between IRC users, mainly spill over from the forums on going arguement between Tico and various other members, we feel it is time to set the record straight.

[b]NEVER[/b] before had the forum been linked with the IRC, it is not something that has been done, and not something that should be done - If a user gets banned on the forums for whatever, why should they recieve more punishment on the IRC? A recent example of this would be that Tico and stork had a dispute, this led to an arguement over PM which led to Tico banning stork - The issue split over into IRC where stork was disputing the ban, until Tico got a bit heavy headed and banned stork - Even though stork had no cause to be banned, besides what had happened on the IRC.


The above incident had sort of been left to rest until today when Tico was confronted with the question of why did he ban stork - There was no great answer to this, it just resulted in a little volley of insults until Tico had to go the Hockey training - Now not 10 minutes ago, Lothy has come onto IRC after his nice little inactive spree in an attempt to cool all the issues that have been present. This now has lead to yet another row because he is trying to claim that storks actions on the forums should be carried over to IRC, despite Thug-life saying that what ever happens on the forums, or in private should not be carried to the IRC. Speljohan_ who has had Channel Operator status on #mopar for quite some time has just had it revoked on the grounds he unbanned stork without any reason being stated - This we believe to be stupid and pointless as Tico did not state that stork shouldn&#39;t be unbanned to all the channel operators.</description>

<p>While the whole ‘what happens on one thing doesn’t affect a user on the other’ is largely true, it’s not absolute. For example, people that have posted things such as porn have been banned from both IRC and the forum. Likewise, any other malicious behaviour will receive the same treatment - we aren’t talking about accidently breaking a rule here; we’re talking about intentionally causing trouble.</p>
<p>Stork intentionally caused trouble, which is why his original account was banned. Stork held a most senior moderator position on the moparscape website. He decided to write a program with intent to systematically delete all of the topics on the moparscape website. This is the kind of intentionally malicious behaviour that I’m speaking of. The fact that he was one of a few that held the most senior moderator position on that website only aggravated the offence.</p>

<p>And what i mean by that is, if someone is punished on the forums for doing something on the forums, they should not be punished on irc - ie say they get warned for being abusive to another user of the forum, they shouldn’t be banned/muted/kicked whatever on the irc for that… I mean there are alot of exceptions to this rule, like say if someone started spamming porn over the forums or just generally were causing trouble on the forum after being banned etc.</p>
<p>I wasn’t there to see the it but from what i understand in storks ban message on the forums Tico stated that if he carried on causing shit on irc he would be banned from there too, he said that stork went and got other people involved to do whatever to get him unbanned. Tico banned him for that, like i said though i didn’t see the full extent of it, but i probably would of banned him too depending on what exactly happened after it - just for shit stirring.</p>
<p>People on <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> didn’t hear Tico’s side of things and only listened to stork who apparently said he was banned just for what he was saying to him in PM which wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>[quote=“NewbieNewty, post:1, topic:253156”]Shit has always carried over from the IRC cowie.</p>
<p>My brother was banned on the forums by Lothy just for bitchin’ people out on the IRC…</p>
<p>I agree anyways however.[/quote]</p>
<p>No, your brother was banned again because we found out after what he said on IRC that he was someone who had been perm banned from the forums.</p>

              <p>Quite a few of us, as you would describe “Elitists” are sick of the shit that is being handed to us on a silver platter by the administration team, a few of us hold staff positions on this site, how ever low on the scale they are our opinions should matter.</p>
<p>The pressing issue that is occuring at this moment in time is the constant fued back and forth between IRC users, mainly spill over from the forums on going arguement between Tico and various other members, we feel it is time to set the record straight.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">NEVER</span> before had the forum been linked with the IRC, it is not something that has been done, and not something that should be done - If a user gets banned on the forums for whatever, why should they recieve more punishment on the IRC? A recent example of this would be that Tico and stork had a dispute, this led to an arguement over PM which led to Tico banning stork - The issue split over into IRC where stork was disputing the ban, until Tico got a bit heavy headed and banned stork - Even though stork had no cause to be banned, besides what had happened on the IRC.</p>
<p>The above incident had sort of been left to rest until today when Tico was confronted with the question of why did he ban stork - There was no great answer to this, it just resulted in a little volley of insults until Tico had to go the Hockey training - Now not 10 minutes ago, Lothy has come onto IRC after his nice little inactive spree in an attempt to cool all the issues that have been present. This now has lead to yet another row because he is trying to claim that storks actions on the forums should be carried over to IRC, despite Thug-life saying that what ever happens on the forums, or in private should not be carried to the IRC. Speljohan_ who has had Channel Operator status on <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> for quite some time has just had it revoked on the grounds he unbanned stork without any reason being stated - This we believe to be stupid and pointless as Tico did not state that stork shouldn’t be unbanned to all the channel operators.</p>
