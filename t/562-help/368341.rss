    <description>I am having trouble with client or the source. I don&#39;t really know which one it is.

Heres the problem
When i try and login everything is fine, until i move. It starts moving away in the direction i click. And it walks through every object along the way. I have tried switch sources and some will work and some still have the same problem. I have also change the client and that hasn&#39;t seemed to work.</description>
