    <description>I&#39;m getting annoyed with these stupid &quot;new&quot; tutorials. each getting more and more dumb. Just send me your e-mail (hotmail only) or pm me.
I will upload the webclient to a specific host for you or send the webclient to you through means of a filesharing site.
I will do any version of any client as long as the ENTIRE source is open. Anything closed (say the signlink) will cause failure and i will be forced to decompile it myself.</description>

<p>Edit: the compiled Jar is the one I made when trying to create my webclient btw. The error message is because i’m running that .bat.</p>
