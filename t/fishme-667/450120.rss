    <title>Fishme 667</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fishme-667/450120</link>
    <description>My friend discovered a new command on my rsps the other day &quot;::fishme&quot; and he decided to be adventurous and use it so all the npcs disappeared and I had to restart the server (which pissed quite a few people off) and then when we got back online one of the players went to a shop and couldn&#39;t use it and then we realised very few of the shops actually worked.. I have been trying for days to fix it even resorting to roll back but everything I  have tried fails so I&#39;ve come here to see if anyone can help me with the problem. 

Here is the command: 

			if (cmd[0].equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;fishme&quot;)) {
				for (NPC n : World.getNPCs()) {
					World.removeNPC(n);
					n.reset();
					n.finish();
				}
				for (int i = 0; i &lt; 18000; i++)
					NPCSpawns.loadNPCSpawns(i);
				return true;
			}

Any help is much appreciated
Thanks,
