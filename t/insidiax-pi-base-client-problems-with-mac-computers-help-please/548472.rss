    <description>Hi guys.

using a PI InsidiaX 317 Client and it does not work with macs. it had an auto cache download feature set to my dropbox, i have changed the cache to download to user.home instead of the C: drive and have changed how the jar executes so its compatable with how java works with mac but it still doesnt download the cache, and when we test it by dragging the cache from dropbox to user.home it still doesnt work. just a white screen. have tried installing jdk 8 update 25 on the mac and compiling with it, and with jdk 7 aswell and it just wont work.

If anyone knows a solution that would be amazing, if nobody knows a solution then any recommendations in the right direction would be appreciated. i have been trying to fix this for days and its driving me nuts.

If anyone would like to view the client gimme a PM and i will send it to you. im not sure if im allowed to post download links here and dont wana break any rules.

thanks guys
