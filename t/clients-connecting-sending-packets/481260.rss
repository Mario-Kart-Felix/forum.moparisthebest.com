    <title>Clients connecting / Sending packets</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/clients-connecting-sending-packets/481260</link>
    <description>I&#39;m curious about two things and because I&#39;m looking more into packets and stuff now and how they work, I thought I&#39;d ask for a little guidance as to how they work etc.. It&#39;s probably really easy for most but if someone could give me information it would be appreciated.

First issue is actually connecting the client to a server. Most servers these days have their own client and just log in through that, but what checks do they make to stop other clients connecting? I want to be able to use my own client to access the server. I&#39;ve changed server ip&#39;s, uids and the uid.dat file and still doesn&#39;t seem to connect. What else would I need to be changing?


Second issue is sending packets. Sending packets to the server through the client manually to find vulnerabilities. Maybe the picking up item packet, but how would it be done and how would it know what and where I&#39;m trying to pick up from etc...
[code=java]
if (inputString.equals(&quot;::pick&quot;)) {
stream.createFrame(236);
stream.writeWord(itemID);
}
[/code]

Would something like that be along the right lines?

Thanks in advance.</description>
