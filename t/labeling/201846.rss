    <description>THIS IS MY ADVICE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE CODING OR DEVELOPING A SERVER AT THE MOMENT!!!

Many people use &quot;base sources&quot; for their server (For some reason these days it project czar) and want to edit them... The only problem is that when they want to delete old things and replace them they dont know whats what?

So if your coding a server use [code]//[/code] and label your items coords cases ect...

I took me about 30mins just to move about 10 things!</description>
