<p>The fault does not only lie with schools. Getting students to eat 5 healthy meals a week, out of the general 35 meals they will eat in a week, does not help the matter. The matter lies in the homes. Its just like people that go to McDonalds every day imo. You have the option to not go (in this case, for schools, bringing lunch), but instead kids tend to eat there because it is less of a hassle than packing a lunch eat morning.</p>

But they are probably paying of their debt as they get money. We arent. So owing more money than you essentially have is very bad.</p>

Not sure what you’re trying to prove, as im not against you. We are only paying interest on our debt, which is the problem. We need to cut back to 2006 spending so we can pay of some of the debt with our interest so eventually things will be balanced out.</p>
<p>Our debt is from our government using other countries money to pay off our socialist-like policies that just wont work here, at least on the federal level. This is why socialism <em>only</em> works if you use other peoples money. This is the problem with alot of democrats. Its not that they’re stupid, wrong, trying to ruin the country etc, they’re just more for big governments and an “even playing field”, which is very socialist-like and socialism is very unfair. Alot of these policies that are biting us in the ass today were put in place by democrats. Dont get me wrong, republicans have done their fair share also.</p>

<p>How do you keep capitalism from turning into socialism? You do the complete opposite. You support the rich and don’t give give them a hard time. Because in capitalism, guess who creates jobs? Not the government, the rich business owners. I dont see the poor providing jobs for anyone, so helping the ones who dont (need) help is a lost cause.<br>

<p>When Ronald Reagen was the governor of California he made community service required for welfare (considering theres no exceptions like disabilities). All the people who could work found jobs very quickly. Why? Because a normal minimum wage job pays more than welfare. That goes to show how poor people who don’t need these assistance payments are just taking advantage of it.</p>

        <p>Frell, you’re being a bit of a hypocrite here. You say that the current debts are Obama’s fault, yet the debts formed under Bush were all the result of external parties/nature.</p>
<p>Let’s try it one more time: The current economic crisis is caused by banks, mainly in the US. Because of your assumption that more government means communism nothing was done about the huge increase on overvalued houses. The bubble burst, and crucial banks were on the verge of bankruptcy. You say that doing nothing would’ve made our current situation better?</p>

        <p>[quote=“R.I.P RSC, post:32, topic:367156”]Frell, you’re being a bit of a hypocrite here. You say that the current debts are Obama’s fault, yet the debts formed under Bush were all the result of external parties/nature.</p>
<p>Let’s try it one more time: The current economic crisis is caused by banks, mainly in the US. Because of your assumption that more government means communism nothing was done about the huge increase on overvalued houses. The bubble burst, and crucial banks were on the verge of bankruptcy. You say that doing nothing would’ve made our current situation better?[/quote]<br>
Obama didnt cause it all, no. But him spending 2.5TN durng his presidency is pretty bad and doesnt help the cause. And Bush didn’t give us much debt himself other than the war debt. The rest of the money spent went to saving the companies that were almost lost during 9/11 and to funding katrina rebuilding. And IIRC its only due to banks because of the defaulted mortgages when the housing market collapsed.</p>

How do you keep capitalism from turning into socialism? You do the complete opposite. You support the rich and don’t give give them a hard time. Because in capitalism, guess who creates jobs? Not the government, the rich business owners. I dont see the poor providing jobs for anyone, so helping the ones who dont (need) help is a lost cause.<br>
[/quote]<br>
uh, you do realize that the companies are the ones creating jobs in socialistic democracy too right?[/quote]<br>
Yes, but instead of giving money to the companies so they can spread and create more jobs your government just spreads the wealth.</p>

When Ronald Reagen was the governor of California he made community service required for welfare (considering theres no exceptions like disabilities). All the people who could work found jobs very quickly. Why? Because a normal minimum wage job pays more than welfare. That goes to show how poor people who don’t need these assistance payments are just taking advantage of it.[/quote]<br>
A normal minimum wage jobs pays more than welfare here too…[/quote]<br>
Thats not my point, my point is that alot of the people are just taking advantage of welfare because they can because they wont have to work.</p>

<p>I couldnt stop thinking about this comic spel.</p>
<p>Someone didn’t do their homework.</p>
<p>That business owner probably invented the product, hes providing free health-care for the worker, free dental care and they match your 401k or ESOP (some companies give their workers part of the ownership of the company through stock programs like ESOP). Thats saving the worker tons of money.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Please give me any kind of evidence that all workers in the US have free health-care and dental-care. That’s just being optimistic.[/quote]<br>
Im not sure how i can really give you evidence, this isnt an issue and i don’t know if it has a name. But yes, in America if you have a job that qualifies as a career (not little in-out fast food jobs or clerk jobs etc) the company will pay for your dental and health care.</p>

Im sorry it seems like im preaching about how socialism sucks, but im tired of Europeans “oh! socialism works here, what now!!! Itll work there to!!! you guys are just greedy!!!”. If we wanted to be a socialist country, we would be. We were not meant to be a socialists and the founding fathers knew this also, they didnt want us to be.<br>

Which is exactly what i fucking pointed out earlier, shame you seem to lack the ability to actually read what you debate aganist.[/quote]<br>
I know, and i already read that. My only comment was on your cartoon.</p>

For the record I’m sure most Europeans here are just bashing on America for the hell of it, and a few have already said they know socialism won’t work in America with the current views being expressed, but moving towards it is a step in the right, rather left direction.<br>

The only way socialism works here is at a state level and not federal level.</p>

<p>That’s a good idea, except that the idea of welfare (assuming you’re referring primarily to support for the unemployed) is that it’s supposed to tide people over for a short period of unemployment - ie, they’re supposed to be out finding a job, which doing community work detracts from. Here we tend to focus on things that will actually help the person find a job, after a period of being on Jobseeker’s Allowance without getting a job you are required to go into programs they provide, starting with training, extra skills etc., and ending with voluntary work and/or paid work subsidised by the program, that is, you get paid more than the benefits would have been but the benefit amount comes from the welfare system so that the employer ends up paying less than he normally would, encouraging employers to participate.</p>

I dont think they worked as long as a normal day nor did they work a full week. But when that policy was put in place dependency on welfare dropped drastically because alot of people found jobs.</p>

It would work well to be done again now. I know 5 people personally that use that to subside for getting a job. Also, they go and get about $300 in food stamps each month, to sell that card for $250 cash. The amount of vulnerability the government has is just ridiculous. To me, if someone is getting money from the government, there needs to be a major stipulation, unless there is a problem that they cannot get a job, there is no reason for someone to use that as an excuse to not work.</p>
