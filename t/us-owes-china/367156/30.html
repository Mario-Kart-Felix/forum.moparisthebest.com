But they are probably paying of their debt as they get money. We arent. So owing more money than you essentially have is very bad.</p>

Not sure what you’re trying to prove, as im not against you. We are only paying interest on our debt, which is the problem. We need to cut back to 2006 spending so we can pay of some of the debt with our interest so eventually things will be balanced out.</p>
<p>Our debt is from our government using other countries money to pay off our socialist-like policies that just wont work here, at least on the federal level. This is why socialism <em>only</em> works if you use other peoples money. This is the problem with alot of democrats. Its not that they’re stupid, wrong, trying to ruin the country etc, they’re just more for big governments and an “even playing field”, which is very socialist-like and socialism is very unfair. Alot of these policies that are biting us in the ass today were put in place by democrats. Dont get me wrong, republicans have done their fair share also.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.gilmerz.com/images/socialism_explained.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>How do you keep capitalism from turning into socialism? You do the complete opposite. You support the rich and don’t give give them a hard time. Because in capitalism, guess who creates jobs? Not the government, the rich business owners. I dont see the poor providing jobs for anyone, so helping the ones who dont (need) help is a lost cause.<br>

<p>When Ronald Reagen was the governor of California he made community service required for welfare (considering theres no exceptions like disabilities). All the people who could work found jobs very quickly. Why? Because a normal minimum wage job pays more than welfare. That goes to show how poor people who don’t need these assistance payments are just taking advantage of it.</p>

<p>I couldnt stop thinking about this comic spel.</p>
<p>Someone didn’t do their homework.</p>
<p>That business owner probably invented the product, hes providing free health-care for the worker, free dental care and they match your 401k or ESOP (some companies give their workers part of the ownership of the company through stock programs like ESOP). Thats saving the worker tons of money.</p>
<p>Poor people have been voting democrat for 70 years…</p>
<p>… and they’re still poor.</p>
<p>Im sorry it seems like im preaching about how socialism sucks, but im tired of Europeans “oh! socialism works here, what now!!! Itll work there to!!! you guys are just greedy!!!”. If we wanted to be a socialist country, we would be. We were not meant to be a socialists and the founding fathers knew this also, they didnt want us to be.</p>

Obama didnt cause it all, no. But him spending 2.5TN durng his presidency is pretty bad and doesnt help the cause. And Bush didn’t give us much debt himself other than the war debt. The rest of the money spent went to saving the companies that were almost lost during 9/11 and to funding katrina rebuilding. And IIRC its only due to banks because of the defaulted mortgages when the housing market collapsed.</p>

Im not sure how i can really give you evidence, this isnt an issue and i don’t know if it has a name. But yes, in America if you have a job that qualifies as a career (not little in-out fast food jobs or clerk jobs etc) the company will pay for your dental and health care.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s a good idea, except that the idea of welfare (assuming you’re referring primarily to support for the unemployed) is that it’s supposed to tide people over for a short period of unemployment - ie, they’re supposed to be out finding a job, which doing community work detracts from. Here we tend to focus on things that will actually help the person find a job, after a period of being on Jobseeker’s Allowance without getting a job you are required to go into programs they provide, starting with training, extra skills etc., and ending with voluntary work and/or paid work subsidised by the program, that is, you get paid more than the benefits would have been but the benefit amount comes from the welfare system so that the employer ends up paying less than he normally would, encouraging employers to participate.</p>
<p>What, did you think the idea was you just keep paying these people welfare forever? It’s designed from the ground up to be a “rehabilitation” (ugh) style scheme. <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/confusedae52.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

When Ronald Reagen was the governor of California he made community service required for welfare (considering theres no exceptions like disabilities).

<p>That’s a good idea, except that the idea of welfare (assuming you’re referring primarily to support for the unemployed) is that it’s supposed to tide people over for a short period of unemployment - ie, they’re supposed to be out finding a job, which doing community work detracts from. Here we tend to focus on things that will actually help the person find a job, after a period of being on Jobseeker’s Allowance without getting a job you are required to go into programs they provide, starting with training, extra skills etc., and ending with voluntary work and/or paid work subsidised by the program, that is, you get paid more than the benefits would have been but the benefit amount comes from the welfare system so that the employer ends up paying less than he normally would, encouraging employers to participate.</p>

It would work well to be done again now. I know 5 people personally that use that to subside for getting a job. Also, they go and get about $300 in food stamps each month, to sell that card for $250 cash. The amount of vulnerability the government has is just ridiculous. To me, if someone is getting money from the government, there needs to be a major stipulation, unless there is a problem that they cannot get a job, there is no reason for someone to use that as an excuse to not work.</p>

Cant find much about it anymore due to the welfare rising during his presidency taking over most pages (democratic congress denied his welfare reform nationally, so welfare stayed as it was). But my parents and teachers all lived through it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ashbrook.org/publicat/oped/hayward/99/gipper.html">http://www.ashbrook.org/publicat/oped/hayward/99/gipper.html</a> It was a partial success, but it was the first time it had been attempted. Trying to prove it could work in a big state like California would prove it would work federally.</p>
<p>Mind you, im talking about just California state. This was never nationwide.</p>

        <p>Frell, you really need to read up on subjects before you start spouting bullshit. For instance, a welfare system does NOT mean that every unemployed person becomes a lazy obese Democrat.</p>
<p>The Dutch system is as follows. Depending on how long you’ve been working before you lose your job, you can get an unemployment benefit for a maximum of 3 years and 2 months. The first 2 months you get 75% of what you earned, and the rest you get 70%. So you lose 30% of your income.</p>
<p>For every year you have worked, you get one month of benefits. So you have to have worked 38 years to get the maximum of 38 months of benefits.</p>
<p>You can only get the benefits if you are fired, so quitting doesn’t pay. If you are fired and you say “great, I don’t care” you don’t get benefits either.</p>
<p>The benefits are not paid for by the state, and aren’t paid for by the working citizens. Employers pay for it, so they can save money by employing people.</p>
<p>When you receive unemployment benefits, you have to apply for a job once a week. The application is reviewed by an institute, and if you don’t take it serious you may lose your benefits. The longer you receive benefits, the less picky you can be.</p>
<p>All this means that people stay unemployed for a very short period. In 2009, 269860 people received unemployment benefits. 144780 Got a job within 6 months. 65750 Within 6 to 12 months, and 59330 needed 12 months or more. In the same year, 377000 people were unemployed.</p>

        <p>Uhhh, i think you’re thinking of social security &amp; unemployment. Here, welfare is a different program that IIRC pays any family whose income falls below a certain amount. They’re provided with payed section 8 housing, food stamps, medicaid etc.</p>
