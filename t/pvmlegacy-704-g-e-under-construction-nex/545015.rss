    <description>Hello and welcome to PvMLegacy! We are a brand new server that currently only consists of myself and other staff members!
We feature all of the God Wars bosses, An Grand Exchange that is currently being worked on, and we will soon accept donations which you can recieve very well-worth insentives for! 
If you want to begin playing on our new server, I&#39;d reccomend you make a forum account as well at http://pvmlegacy.smfnew2.com/index.php
But, if you just can&#39;t wait to get your hands on that client, I&#39;ll refer you to http://pvmlegacy.smfnew2.com/server-downloads/our-client-(2014)/

Thank you for your time, and I hope you enjoy your stay at PvMLegacy!
