    <description>What Are We Coming To? Will We Ever Pay For Music Again?

In a world were the internet is at large. Downloading has become a big source for music. I personally download music regularly, and a lot of my music collection is made up of downloaded music. But stop. Think. Think about what happens when you download music. An artist will spend hours writing music, practicing it and recording it. Then we hop of limewire or another product of p2p applications and download it. Without paying a cent. How do those artists feel? After you have just downloaded there music for free. After they have spent countless hours getting it out.

If that was your job and you tried to make money of it. Would you like it you never made any sales but everyone had your music. Now a lot of artists are rich. But it doesn’t change the fact that you should pay for music. It’s like working in a business and people steal your products instead of buying them.

A big source for downloading music is the program; limewire, it runs on the Gnutella network. And is a big source of music and other files. Literally anyone can grab the program and start downloading music from other people on the network. But is this fair? Is this what we are coming to? Will you ever pay for music again? It seems no. Music is available easily without paying. Mainly because of p2p applications and warez sites.

Is this fair for artists to be putting out music if we are just going to download it off some p2p network? I don’t think it is. And we should all realize that it isn’t fair for them. Bands will get lower record sales and less profits; even though there music is getting distributed at large, to a wide variety of people. I started to realize this when I was looking at the record sales for some bands. Even though the bands were hugely popular there record sales weren’t that high. It alarmed me even more when I was watching CSI. They were talking about a singer. One of the characters in it said she would have to go and “download” some of his music. She didn’t say try, buy or borrow a CD. She said she would “download” it. 

With music so easily available for free. Why should you pay for it. Why pay for music when you can just go on limewire or albumbase.com and just download it? As the internet expands music will be more easily available for all. Now I’m not suggesting to just stop downloading music all together (although I recommend doing that). I’m trying to get the point out that you should support the artists you like. Buy the occasional album or t-shirt. 

You have the right to distribute this file as whole. Get the message across!

              <p>I download… Mod Taharok … i don’t know what your saying. Alot of the songs on limewire have been ripped off of official CDs so they are exactly the same quality. I did have some trouble with skipping in songs when i started using it but then i got a new computer and they don’t skip. So it was the computer not the song.</p>

              <p>I’m torn on this issue. I can see how it could be seen as wrong, BUT artists make shit all money from selling CDs anyway. Most of their income comes from DJing, Gigs, Sponsorship, stuff like that. I know a few artists who don’t care if people are ripping their music, since they were getting pennies from the sales anyway.</p>

I could only imagine how hard it could be starting out these days, considering you might sell a song one day, and 48 hours later it’s circulated around the world. It really needs to be put into context.</p>

<p>is torrenting legal?<br>
nope.<br>
is everyone who torrents punnished?<br>
nope<br>
so maybe they don’t care enough to sue, but that doesn’t mean it is ok “legally”</p>
