    <description> First of, for all you liberals who want the troops back. GTFO, If we call them back we are probly going to have a.. i dont know maybe another 9/11? Better yet, well probly get a 1/11, 2/11, 3/11 etc.

 Bit immature about the nuke iraq theory, friend over and he said include in the title.


what do you guys think?



*If you live in iraq and you dont like terrorists also, if you see one, kick em&#39; in the balls*</description>

<p>Lol you mean Sudam Husain? (or so damn insane) Osama Bin Laden used to be allies with the UN (united nations for the people who dont know) For a long time we were even allies up intil The Gulf war then friend ship between UN and Osama Slowly degraded because we were supplying wepons to Enimeys of them… And right before 9/11 osama bin laden was in a Us army Hospital (in the middle east)…but as for pulling the troops out i think give it a bit more time. it all has to do with the presidental election and if there presedent can get Extremist somewhat Controlled. I say We keep them in there (most troops) for a bit more time mabe 2-4 years. But in my opinion i think that we will always be in the middle east somewhere and maby not with as many troops but… still some.</p>
<p>(sorry if you disagree my opinion)<br>

Yeah, in 2008 I think once Hilary clinton gets president and it’s that time of the month for her. I bet she will go crazy and have a bitchfit and try to nuke them.<br>
[/quote]Then we will have China on our ass, but I’m having my doubts that she will win. Americans are dumb, but their not dumb enough to vote another Clinton are they?[/quote]</p>
<p>BTW i agree with you America isnt ready for a woman president yet (i personnaly will vote for Baraak Obama) he will make a great president but i think that people need to realise HILLARY AINT BILL!!</p>

              <p>Oh come on, I’m sick of this 9/11 conspiracy bullshit.  It’s fucking impossible.  1. Bush planned it? WHY?  We didn’t get a drop of damn oil out of it, so that’s out the window.  2. You think that something that big could be covered up?  90% of the country hates bush right now, so if he planned 9/11 I’m sure someone on the inside would have leaked out long ago that the government planned it.<br>
3. The 9/11 commission.  Do you know how much investigation was done to find out what happened? They would have unearthed something fishy.<br>
4. If we wanted a reason to invade Afghanistan, do you honestly think that’s the best we could do?</p>
<p>Now, for Iraq: It was stupid to go there.  The Afghanis attacked us, we came over there and kicked their asses.  Why did we have to go to Iraq? The weapons of mass destruction.  Oh well.  It’s done now.  I think it’s stupid to blame Bush because it was his intelligence that told him Sadam had weapons so I don’t blame him, even though I don’t like Bush.  If we leave now they will laugh in our faces.  How pathetic does it make America look when we go after one of the weakest countries in the world and the spit in our face?  I say we actually mobilize the troops big time, get the hell over there, kick their asses and come back.  Otherwise the world view of us as pussies will just increase more. Everyone talks about how they hate terrorists so much, why not do something about it?  If we crush the terrorism in Iraq and pacify the country it will send a message to the terrorists to back off.</p>
<p>And, for the record, I don’t like Bush.  I don’t like politicians.  Any of them.  They’re all sleeze bags that only care about their own power and spend their day talking and never get anything done.</p>

China is a major issue in why he hasn’t, not to mention that the security of our airports is so secure that any old Iraqi can arrive at our airports from the north and whatnot. We need to keep allies on both borders, ya see. If we go bomb Iraq, we now have problems on the West-Coast, we still got British and Germany on the East, but most of the goods in America are Chinese(LOL AMERICANS ARE IDIOTS?).

its 50/50 for me cause if this war doesnt clear up in the next 4 years(which is wen ill be 18), then ill go out and have an experience on how the battlefield really is and hopefully live to tell about it. i will do it for my country, not you bush.<br>
