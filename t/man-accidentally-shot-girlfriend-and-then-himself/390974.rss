<p>Absolutely!  Just like you can’t drive a car without training and the proper license, you can’t carry a weapon without training and the proper license.  Same thing.</p>

I’m 99% sure you mean 870, as in Remington 870.  Still, idiot to not make sure it’s unloaded at least a few times before cleaning it.  At least your grandpa practiced the next rule, always keep a gun pointed in a safe direction, regardless of if it loaded or not.  The guy in this thread didn’t.[/quote]<br>
I meant 270 as in the round <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  I don’t remember the exact model of the rifle, and we sold it a while ago.  Anyways, the gun went off as he was pulling it out of the closet, so there wasn’t much he could do.  He never hunted with it, it was either my stepdad or one of my uncles that put it away still loaded.</p>
<p>Anyways, always treat a gun like it’s loaded :\</p>
