              <p>Woops here,<br>
ok this is what you do if you are running the moparscape client and trying to log in a server …</p>
<p>EX: if you wanna connect to say… kittyscape and the i.p. says kittyscape.no-ip.biz &lt;-------- that is your i.p. so that is what you put for the i.p. and if the port is 43594 you click on file then new port then type in 43594… hope that helped</p>
