    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/old-school-rsc-online-updated-pk-now/280691</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

This server is based on the old school RSC before the wilderness.

-------------------------------------
The server has been running for a while but has failed to attract enough players online at any one time.  I personally think this is because people register - login and logout when they see only a few people online.  So we&#39;re probably going to call it a day but before we do we&#39;re going to turn this into a PK server.

Free mith set, ruby ammy and rune 2h (all spawning in lumbridge and lobster certs are spawning in draynor). Simply login take the armour and pk.. exp rates are very fair.

*note* server probably wont be online for too long.. but you can login and pretty much PK... see below for details of the server.

The server will update will occur at 0000 UK time (Wed 03 June).
-------------------------------

Everywhere (besides lumby) is wilderness. Outside of lumby it is level 8 wildy, there are a few &quot;danger zones&quot;. While in a danger zone, any level of combat can attack eachother (You will be notified before entering a danger zone, also if your in one it will show in the bottom right corner).

Alot of the map is restricted, to keep it smaller and easier to find other people (Port sarrim,p2p zones,falador, are all blocked off)

In lumberbridge there is a master fisherman, which gives out free trout (this is not the best food in game, swordfish are, also you can buy lobsters/tuna from the general store in lumby. Along with fishing supplies)

- Armor is sold in varrock general shop (also some addy in there aswell)
- R2H is sold in edgevil for 150K (Along with other 2h&#39;s)
- There are no armour/weapon restrictions (you can wield addy and rune 2h at 1 attack etc.)
- protect from missiles and protect items have been disabled
- max stat is 75
- p2p magic is disabled
- you can teleport to Draynor Village, Edgeville and Varrock via an NPC


Danger zone: (Draynor Manner)

Danger Zone: (Varrock Castle)

While in the varrock castle danger zone, there are 3 different types of npcs. Heroes,Paladins and white knights.

              <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I think its about time we call it quits - we simply cannot attrack enough players.  I just want to apoligise and thank everyone for playing.  I think we still have the VPS for about a week or so, so we will be turning the server into a PK Server. eg, full addy, ammy and r2hs on floor… and maybe give our old members full rune etc.</p>
<p>I’m really sorry but I dont think its working and we’re out of ideas. I’m just hoping this will attract a few pkers so we can have fun for a week or so.</p>
<p>Thanks for playing.<br>
Sal</p>
<p>Update will hopefully happen at 0000 Uk Time</p>

<p>Just because you see no logic doesn’t mean there isn’t any. Did he do that work? No. Does he get any credit for all the <span class="bbcode-b">hard</span> work? No. So why should he call adding an ID and coords in an XML file an update?<br>
I can see if he actually coded something unique, but sorry, I see no logic in saying XMLing is an update, when someone else did all the work, and all he had to do was put in an ID and coords.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>How are XML updates not considered updates? As Ecko said earlier, it’s an update from how the server was, previously. Even if XML editing is easy, that doesn’t mean that you can consider it an update. Besides, you have RSCPK (which Ian coded 90% for you, right?) to worry about, so stop flaming in this thread.[/quote]</p>
<p>You went completely off-topic with RSCPK. Also yes Ian did code 90% of it. Wanna know why? <span class="bbcode-b">BECAUSE HE’S MY CODER YOU IDIOT</span>.<br>
I’ve already stated why XMLing aren’t updates, quit asking me the same question.</p>

<p>As you can see, updating is the act of adding something to the original that wasent there before. So xml edit’s are cosidered updates even if some people think its “not worth” being called update, personal opinion dosent override the definition.</p>

Yes, changes.<br>
XMLing requires little to no work. It’s not in the “update” category. So yes, from now on we’ll call them “changes”.[/quote]<br>
A change would be an update. You follow no logic with your posts.</p>
<p>And XML edits were the first thing done when RSCDaemon came online. If it weren’t for other people taking the time to properly update it in the beginning, there wouldn’t have been a source like this that is so closely replicated to RSC. Proper definitions, locations, rates, etc, were all updates everyone helped out with.</p>
<p>And just because XML requires a “little” amount of work, it doesn’t mean it’s not an update. And as blacknight already pointed out, most of it wasn’t even XML updates. XML updates just take longer to get right.</p>
