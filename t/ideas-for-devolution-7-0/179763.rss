    <description>Hey, I was thinking earlier about devolution training..


1)                Well, I was wondering how I could go about adding a working dharok effect into it.. I know where to add it, and I know that Project-Czar uses the effect...  
This is the code Project-Czar uses:
[code]}
		if (FullDharokEquipped())
                {
		MaxHit += (getLevelForXP(playerXP[playerHitpoints]) - playerLevel[playerHitpoints])/2;
                }
		playerMaxHit = (int)Math.floor(MaxHit);
	}
	public boolean FullDharokEquipped() {
		if(playerEquipment[playerHat] == 4716 &amp;&amp;playerEquipment[playerChest] == 4720 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerLegs] == 4722 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 4718)
                {
		return true;
                }
		return false;[/code]
Being a newb coder i tried to just C+P the code (Free 100 errors plz?).. 
 Just looking for any pointers from any experienced coders as to how i would set out the code, or how It would need to be for the it to &quot;work&quot; etc..

2)          Was thinking about using something to remove health... In this case i chose 7509 (a dwarven rock cake)
I added the item as food... Just like manta&#39;s etc, and tried to reverse it.. so instead of it being += 100, it being -= 97, idk really what to do to accomplish this.. stuck fiddling hoping to get it right so if somebody with any knowledge on this. Ty guys.
Thanks guys,
Nice  :D</description>
