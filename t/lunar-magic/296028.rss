    <description>Hey guys. I finally found a good client, i transfered the models into my new client, but i found a huge problem. Varrock fountain has wood all over it, idk why it might be the models even though i didnt edit it. I also want to find a tut on lunar magic. I cant seem to find one. I only see help ones but no one is helping.</description>
