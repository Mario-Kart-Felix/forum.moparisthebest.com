Lennox Lewis’s long-awaited meeting with Mike Tyson looked less likely than ever Fri after the Lewis camp eliminated the possibility for the long run. A senior aide to the WBC and IBF champ insisted that the fight “was not going to happen” as the two fighters have been contracted to rival television companies. Lewis is 2 fights into a seven-contest cope with cable company HBO , while Tyson has an arrangement with rival network Showtime . “It’s a ridiculous contract * the Tyson fight won’t go ahead,” stated the aide. “He’s secured into his own commitment and it’s not feasible.” The Lewis get away had suggested Thurs . that the fight become screened on HBO , a proposal which would power Tyson to compensate Showtime out of his or her cut of the bag. Tyson’s manager Shelly Finkel said that Lewis’s requirements on the split regarding television cash have been “laughable,” adding that it was “clear that Lennox does not desire the fight.” An agreement which would see both cable companies testing the fight simultaneously also seems unlikely. "It would be practically impossible, as there is absolutely no financial incentive for your companies to do so,Inch said industry professional Tom Umstead of Variable Channel News. "They will have to go through the In Demand submitting house or pay them down. “If they did that will, they would have to make a deal individually with 1000s of cable operators by themselves which would be nearly impossible from a distribution perspective,” he included. Jason Oberlander, a publicist for Showtime, says the company was willing to try to get to agreement with Cinemax . “Showtime is open to mediation. We are open to conversations to work this out and about and see what we are able to do,” he said.(Chemical)2001 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Insomnia has long been thought of as an indication of depression, nevertheless new research shows it may well actually trigger the mental disorder.A single study, depressed older persons with insomnia had been 17 times prone to remain depressed after having a year than sufferers who were sleeping properly. The findings had been presented Tuesday at the 19th Annual Conference of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies in Denver.In a separate study, seniors along with insomnia and no history of depression were six times more likely to experience an episode of despression symptoms as seniors with no insomnia. The relationship was strong for ladies and for people who are afflicted by a particular insomnia structure that awakens a person repeatedly during the night.Both studies were executed by researchers in the University of Rochester Slumber and Neurophysiology Research Laboratory. Lab director Michael Perlis, PhD, tells WebMD that while your research focused on seniors, the findings could affect anyone with chronic sleeping disorders. "The assumption has been that when depression is well treated, the sleeplessness will go away, however, this is not the case,Inches Perlis tells WebMD. "It is more and more clear that you can not ignore chronic sleeping disorders [in patients with depression]. You have to treat it."Other ResearchIn another research, researchers report that individuals with depression as well as sleep problems treated with the antidepression drug Prozac and the sleep loss drug Lunesta got better more quickly than those treated for depression only.Perlis and colleagues are also performing depression studies to discover if treating sleeping disorders reduces the severity or even lengthens the time involving episodes of depression.    no prior page next    1/2  <a href="http://www.shinglespringsdreamhomes.com/guccioutlet.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">gucci outlet</a><br>
