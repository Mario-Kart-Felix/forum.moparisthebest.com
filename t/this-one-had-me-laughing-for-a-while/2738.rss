[QUOTE]An American, a Brit and an Iraqi are in a bar one night having a tea.

The Yankee drinks his tea and suddenly throws his glass in the air,

pulls out a gun and shoots the glass to pieces. He says, &quot;In the

states our glasses are so cheap that we don&#39;t need to drink from the

Same one twice.&quot;

The Brit obviously impressed by this, drinks his tea, throws his

glass into the air, pulls out his gun and shoots the glass to pieces. He

says,

&quot;In Britain we have so much sand to make the glasses that we don&#39;t

Need to drink out of the same glass twice either.&quot;

The Iraqi, cool as a cucumber, picks up his tea and drinks it, throws

his glass into the air, pulls out his gun and shoots the American and

the Brit. He says &quot;In Baghdad we have so many Americans and Brits that

We don&#39;t need to drink with the same ones twice.&quot;[/QUOTE]</description>
