    <description>First off if this is not allowed i will delete the post but i really think that this needs to be pointed out because i see over 20 requests a day on the various Sections

Read the questions on not what to ask here: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,59918.0.html

Then if you would like to learn how to make your very own server then you can go here: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,37596.0.html

if you want help on a specific area then i will be more than willing to help you among with many other members of this community. You really need to try before asking these questions that you obviously not tryed to answer yourself. I know for a fact how hard it can be when you are new to all this and every person has had to start somewhere wheter it was with private servers or not. All i am saying is that if you want help ask for it but try to resolve the problems first.

[b]Simple Error Fixing[/b]

I would like to point out that if you have made your server and then edited it and get 100 errors or so then do not panic chances are that 1 error has caused all this. Often enough it is a command that has been created wrong. 

another common error is you server/runserver or even startserver.bat is not working. there are a number of possible reasons for this such as: Wrong Version of Java, Server has not bee compiled and so many more. But there is an answer to this. Mod Tharok has made a perfect compiler which can be used to run and compile your server here is the link to it which you should read because it provides some useful information - http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,49747.0.html

Other errors that you may experience is that the server will not write the trade logs or chat logs in to a text document. This is probably because it has a different target that it will write the file to. Search for [code]c:/[/code] in client.java and change the target files to your own.

Also please take note that your IP is not 127.0.0.1, this is your local connection which allows only you to connect via that address. You will have to create a Hamachi Network or No-ip to get it working
here is the hamachi website - www.hamachi.cc
No-ip Website - www.no-ip.com

These are very simple errors that are caused and they can easily be fixed. If you would like me to add any more then please post here or even if you have an error please post it here and i will help you fix it if i can.

Thanks Rob</description>
