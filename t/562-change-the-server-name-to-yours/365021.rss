    <title>[562] Change the server name to yours</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-change-the-server-name-to-yours/365021</link>
    <description>i felt after long messing around this was very needed, if you feel like this topic should be moved then do so, this is my first tut ever and please don&#39;t flame me and yes i know most people are lazy now a days so here it is;

When ever you log in don&#39;t you notice that the game keeps saying someone Else&#39;s name for ex:

RuneSlay , the base that I&#39;m going to show you how to edit that one; i have not figured how to change welcome to runeslay on the message box when you log in, i have searched every file possible; even client sided (Wasted my time) it took me hours just to change these simple things because all the searching i did, 

okay first off i will start with client sided;

go to the client, open up folder &quot;src&quot;  then open up file &quot;Applet_Sub1.java&quot; (this should be the first file there on the top)

Then press ctrl + F (that opens up the search box) Search for &quot;RuneSlay&quot; and replace that with what you want it to be here is a pic of what it changes;

after that, when it loads it will say &quot;Runeslay 562 is loading....&quot; Here is how you change that

Go to the Client; Open up the folder &quot;src&quot; then open up this file; &quot;Class184.java&quot;

Search for &quot;RuneSlay&quot; and change that what you want to; i cannot take a picture now but i will upload it tomorrow.

Now for the server sided Stuff this is where the tut gets really long. I will try and shorten this as much as possible but here it goes.

1. Open up the source folder.
2. Open up folder &quot;src&quot;.
3. Open up folder &quot;com&quot;.
4. Open up folder &quot;rs2hd&quot;.
5. Open up File &quot;Main.java&quot;.
6. Search for &quot;RuneSlay&quot;.
7. Change that to what you want.
8. Open up file Server.java
9. Search for &quot;RuneSlay&quot;.
10. Change that to what you want.
11. Open up the folder &quot;model&quot;
12. Open up the file &quot;player.java&quot;
13. Search for &quot;SERVER&quot;
14. beside that there should be a message about runeslay; change that to what you want
* what this does is changes the server message after you have played for so long

15. Open up folder &quot;net&quot;
16. open up file &quot;ActionSender.java&quot;
17. Search for &quot;sup&quot; 
*what this does is changes what you say when you log in.

-if you request me on how to edit the commands that where already put there to give you credits i will gladly show you

Hoped this helped Post any Questions/Comments abut this tut i will take all criticism constructively.</description>
