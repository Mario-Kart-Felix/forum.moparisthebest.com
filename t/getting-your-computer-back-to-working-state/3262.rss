Thanks for the guide, however, most people already knew this. You should also state that going to Start &gt; Run &gt; Type “msconfig” &gt; Ok &gt; Startup and unchecking some programs will increase startup time.[/quote]</p>
<p>rofl, I’ve been busy, didn’t have much time to do anything.</p>

<p>I’d like to know what problems you talking about besides the basic freezing and lag. Are you talking about freezing while playing games cause that’s a normal type of thing, then theres the lag from overloaded cpu usage and also too many downloading processes running at the same time. Just tellin.</p>
