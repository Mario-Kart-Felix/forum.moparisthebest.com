    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-questions-for-you-aswome-coders/303258</link>
    <description>well first off, i&#39;m not embaressed by the questions i ask because i might not be very good at coding but still, here are my questions.

1.whats the diference a client and server? i know the client is the downloaded version with all the files, and the servre just the i-p thing but whats&#39; the diference?

2.how do i make it so that accounts are created (for ingame rs) by registering on my forum?

3.(easy question) how do i change the name of the servre and the bg picture for my client (on the log-in page)

4.i&#39;ve seen in seom servers, the image around the compass/map, and the text area, you could have a cool diferent style/image/watever u wanna call it, how can i add something like that? (i edited this thread so i cud ask this question)

5.how do i make, and put a custom made item into my server? ty 

6.can i not make the server public but still edit it and go ingame to see how my servre is coming along?(i edited again to add this)</description>

<li>BG - Go into your client’s sprites folder, and look for the current background.<br>
Edit it using paint (DO NOT MAKE IT ANY BIGGER THAN IT IS) and make sure to ONLY change it by editing THAT EXACT PICTURE. Otherwise it may stop working. ^^"</li>
