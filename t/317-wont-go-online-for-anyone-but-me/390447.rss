    <title>317 wont go online for anyone but me</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-wont-go-online-for-anyone-but-me/390447</link>
    <description>I can connect to it from the moparscape client fine, but nobody else seems to. When i tested it on another computer, neither could that computer. I have changed all the 127.0.0.1 in the files to my server IP, but nobody except me can connect!

I tried making it into a jar file then making a webclient there, but then after it loads the java, it just goes white and cant load.

How can i fix this?</description>

              <p>Thanks, ill try that later, but another concern adding to what you said. Does Mopar need the client.jar? I really dont care if people get on from my site, as long as its on mopar.</p>

              <p>Reason the Mopar client isn’t working is because probably your server has a UID number set that disables people from using cheat clients but also disables them from using ones that are not yours. And you have to make sure when you set up your webclient that you 1) get the cache downloader and everything else set up right 2) make sure you signed and jared your client correctly 3) make sure where it reads your jar file from is right (if its not on your site you must put a link in) 4) update your java. Try all those if that doesn’t work try redoing the Tutorial or if you didn’t use one in the first place try using one. Hope this helped!</p>
