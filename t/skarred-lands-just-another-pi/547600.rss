    <title>Skarred-Lands - &quot;Just another PI&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/skarred-lands-just-another-pi/547600</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve decided to try and start a development team again.
I have some funds to get us started, but overall, I would like to see this as a rsps funded by it&#39;s community. Some may think that sounds outrageous or bold, but I&#39;ve seen servers out there that were just renamed Trisidia releases getting 15 players online a day and a constant stream of cash.
That just means there are endless possibilities for [i]real*[/i] servers.
[size=2pt]*[/size][size=1pt]by real I mean one that isn&#39;t just a renamed leech.[/size]

Please understand &quot;Just another PI&quot; is not the real slogan of the server. I figured, regardless of what I put there, people would see it as &quot;just another PI&quot; since it&#39;s a PI based server.

Now, lets move onto the content.
[code=Content]
Custom Forum Integration! (Not required to play :O)
Item &amp; NPC definitions, npc drops, npc spawns, custom objects, and shops loaded through json.
Custom dungeoneering (To be rewrote)
Custom yell titles (also needs to be worked on)
My own dicing, not that it&#39;s unique.
Beer barrels work.
My own mystery boxes.
Half-assed smiley system.
&quot;unique&quot; teleport interface.
[INFO] and Lottery tickers that have toggles.
Pickables.
All skills are working. There is no summoning. I replaced it with dungeoneering.
I added some &quot;anti cheat engine and anti rune-agent&quot; crap in. It&#39;s not the best but it&#39;s something. I&#39;ll rewrite it when I can.
[/code]

I guess this is media. If you want more or something else I mentioned, uh say it i guess?

Updated Dungeoneering spot... Etheral guide now handles the shop along with resetting progress and checking floors.

The bank. Don&#39;t really need much more than the bank all icon tbh.

So I&#39;m sittin in a throne. Beer barrels in the back work. You grab a glass from the shelves and then use it on the barrels. I&#39;ve got 1 of each drink. Also, say hi to my pet KBD.

teleport interface. I edited it so the nav buttons are on both sides, and the orange thing is on each side too. Other than that, not mine.

              <p>Position wanted:<br>
alpha/ beta testing, ideas, simple server sided coding</p>
<p>Background in position:<br>
when im not working most of my free time goes to playing rsps and working on coding my own. i can play through the server like im a everyday player and test all the skills, minigames, quests ext. and look for glitches and bugs. also when you make updaes i can test those and help make sure they are working properly.</p>
<p>Example works:<br>
working on codes and testing my own rsps. also played more rsps then i can name.</p>
<p>Time available:<br>
i spend most of my time (when not working) on rsps  or attempting to code mine. sometimes 50+ hrs in a week or sometimes 20 hours a week. if i really enjoy what i do on your server while trying to help then it is likely i spent most time on it then probably most people.</p>
<p>Other info:<br>
if i come up with a idea of something to implement to your server i can try and write the codes and then give to you and ofcourse it is your decision to use it or not from there.<br>
Also i am willing to learn nearly anything when it comes to rsps coding since i am working on one myself and still want to learn as much more as possible.<br>
but since you already know more then me about coding i dont expect to really come up with much if anything that would couldnt already do yourself so mostly i would just be testing i guess.</p>

I love your office lololol, and are you integrating your custom skill level display &gt; combat level display or nah?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>The skill / combat level display already exists in the client, it was just never utilized.[/quote]<br>
This, honestly…</p>
<p>(Thanks for the bump Atomic lol).<br>
I was editing something in player updating and noticed a variable set to 0. I was like, the fuck is this shit? So I went client sided and found the same data (but in stream not out)… Eventually it led me to the method where you draw the right click player menu… And in that code? It had 2 different options, the default combat showing, and then the skill showing… However skill showing wasn’t implemented…</p>
<p>TL;DR I basically connected a couple fuckin dots.</p>
<p>[hr]<br>
Some updates to show the server is alive still <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
Note these aren’t in my update log I was using… I moved to github.</p>
<p><code>
Fixed scrollbar nullpointer (Scrolling where interfaces didn't exist threw nullpointers)
Removed the "custom gameframes" so there's only the 1 now.
Server sided maps updated to 508 - Matching client maps
Teleporting rewrote - No more process based teleports.
New setting interface (extended options for the info/lotto ticker, skill display, and more)
Fixed an arrow bug. </code></p>
<p>These aren’t all the updates… I have never been good at keeping track. Even with the use of github. lol.</p>

              <p>So I’ve decided to try and start a development team again.<br>
I have some funds to get us started, but overall, I would like to see this as a rsps funded by it’s community. Some may think that sounds outrageous or bold, but I’ve seen servers out there that were just renamed Trisidia releases getting 15 players online a day and a constant stream of cash.<br>
That just means there are endless possibilities for <span class="bbcode-i">real*</span> servers.<br>
[size=2pt]*[/size][size=1pt]by real I mean one that isn’t just a renamed leech.[/size]</p>
<p>Please understand “Just another PI” is not the real slogan of the server. I figured, regardless of what I put there, people would see it as “just another PI” since it’s a PI based server.</p>
<p>Now, lets move onto the content.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Custom Forum Integration! (Not required to play :O)
Item &amp; NPC definitions, npc drops, npc spawns, custom objects, and shops loaded through json.
Custom dungeoneering (To be rewrote)
Custom yell titles (also needs to be worked on)
My own dicing, not that it's unique.
Beer barrels work.
My own mystery boxes.
Half-assed smiley system.
"unique" teleport interface.
[INFO] and Lottery tickers that have toggles.
Pickables.
All skills are working. There is no summoning. I replaced it with dungeoneering.
I added some "anti cheat engine and anti rune-agent" crap in. It's not the best but it's something. I'll rewrite it when I can.</code></pre>
<p>I guess this is media. If you want more or something else I mentioned, uh say it i guess?<br>

Updated Dungeoneering spot… Etheral guide now handles the shop along with resetting progress and checking floors.<br>

So I’m sittin in a throne. Beer barrels in the back work. You grab a glass from the shelves and then use it on the barrels. I’ve got 1 of each drink. Also, say hi to my pet KBD.<br>

teleport interface. I edited it so the nav buttons are on both sides, and the orange thing is on each side too. Other than that, not mine.<br>
