    <title>Help with Npc&#39;s retaliating</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-npcs-retaliating/172275</link>
    <description>Hi, I was wanting to know if anyone could help me out with a problem im having. When I attack an npc, it doesn&#39;t fight back, unless I click on it twice. Sorry if someone has already posted how to do this, but I searched, and didn&#39;t seem to find anything. So, yeah, if you could help, it would be awesome. Thanks. :D</description>
