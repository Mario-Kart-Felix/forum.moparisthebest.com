    <title>[AN IDEA/SUGGESTION] Suggestions/ideas section and general talking</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/an-idea-suggestion-suggestions-ideas-section-and-general-talking/194003</link>
    <description>I would think that if we had one of these areas more people would come to the moparscape community just to chat about other things than private servers.
I mean we could even have a spamming section because I have an smfforfree and I know you can make boards that do not benefit your post count so yeah....
I would think we need one because I have allot of suggestions on my mind but I won&#39;t list them here.
Please just take a look at this and consider it.</description>
