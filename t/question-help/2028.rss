    <description>right the towns in the priv servers are there... but say you wanted to create your own village with buildings etc..

how would you go about doing this and finding the place to put it because i havent seen any java code for buildings in some files i have been in?

is it possible??

could someone maybe explain, what you would need to do to make a building and ill do the rest??
or atleast point me in the right direction??

              <p>well yes, it is all possible… in varrock there will be a Admin Owned House, it isn’t a basic house within the client, it’s a house all created by the server… but sometimes there do are some problems with it left (like the floor) but i’ve already done alot at that house. it will come with WS v3.3 <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Also that AOH can be easy editted from a simple CFG file…<br>
And to make your own houses you must first find a flat floor, if it isn’t flat your hous’ wall probably will be messed up… i took me like 30 min to find a good flat part in the “big” parts of the world… (first search out a good spot where oyu wish to build, go there and see if the floor is flat enough, if not pick another part… i did try many parts, and only one place in varrock matched the flat ground… yet i didn’t look at other parts for more flat ground. Also you cannot build on the black parts of the map after a certain coordinate, i don’t know yet why, but it is true.)</p>
