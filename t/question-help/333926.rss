    <title>Question. HELP!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-help/333926</link>
    <description>How can i make it to where i spawn an npc but it does attack, it just stand there? I just want to see if it looks good incase i need to change the gfx and shit. 

When i do ::npc #### say i do graandor. I spawn him and he attacks, how can i make it so that the npc WILL NOT attack when i spawn.

If you still do now get what I mean, some servers have pictures of all their god wars boss&#39;s and minions standing beside each other, and they aren&#39;t attacking, how can i spawn them infront of me without them attacking me?

Thanks</description>
