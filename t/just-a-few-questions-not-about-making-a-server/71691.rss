    <description>Er...hey!  Okay, to the point.  I&#39;ve always wondered HOW THE HECK do we get runescape&#39;s cache?  I heard from someone that JaGex has it on our computers, but what?  Can someone please explain how we get runescape 2&#39;s cache?  Thanks.  Now I have another question, about Aryan, what exactly is it?  Thanks!</description>

              <p>But what do we download that has the cache?  BTW, I’m not trying to get their new cache, if Silab hasn’t even gotten it yet (I don’t think she has it) theres no way I’ll get it.</p>

              <p>This would go in client hacking. Plus just check the folder they download the cache to, and unpack yours, replace, and repack (Harder than it sounds). But wed need another game engine.</p>
