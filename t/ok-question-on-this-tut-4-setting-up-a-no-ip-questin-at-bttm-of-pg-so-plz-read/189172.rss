    <description>No-ip!

Start off by opening up your internet browser (Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc.). In the address box, type &#39;http://www.no-ip.com/.&#39;

Or, just follow the link. 

If you currently have a No-Ip Account registered, please skip this step.

To register an account on No-Ip, you need to click &#39;Sign-up Now!.&#39;


Now once you have entered the required information it will say that a activation email has been sent to the email to entered.

After you have activated your account, you need to log in.

After your webpage has been redirected, you will see a column named &#39;Hosts/Redirects,&#39; under that, you will see &#39;Add,&#39; click it.


Now you need to enter the required information.


Fill in hostname you need to enter your server name and for the ending of it click the scroll down search option to find a list of endings like no-ip.org , no-ip.info ETC.
You will notice a bunch of numbers in the collum &#39;IP address&#39; well thats your IP ADDRESS don&#39;t change that just skip it
Once you are finished click 

If you have done everything correctly, you will see this screen.


Optional:

For an auto ip updater go to the download section at the top of the screen , select windows , MAC or linux then download the ip updater , this will auto update your internet ip adress , and there you have it your own no-ip host for your server.
Hope that helped some people out as I&#39;ve seen alot of requests for this.
The download section page on www.no-ip.com looks like:



GRATZ now all you have to do is connect to your server using the host name you filled out .



ok now if u read the line above this it says-GRATZ now all you have to do is connect to your server using the host name you filled out-well how do i connect to my server using the host name(e.g. servernamehere.no-ip.biz)</description>
