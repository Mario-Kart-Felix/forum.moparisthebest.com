    <title>Why do people spread viruses? and make you do surveys</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-do-people-spread-viruses-and-make-you-do-surveys/347734</link>
    <description>Well i was looking on youtube for some programs and i&#39;ve seen like average people making youtube videos with downloads in the videos, all the videos are different and stuff. and some just give me a download link that take me to pointless surverys, they don&#39;t seem like a company they seem like average people.

i&#39;ve always wondered WHY they do it? do they get paid?

share your thoughts ^^.</description>

              <p>no i didn’t know that. actually it’s all based off thinking because i haven’t created a virus before, but i didn’t think VB would do for a very good virus.</p>
<p>If you are reading this message…<br>
It has been reported that when people are severely tortured, they enter a state of self-induced coma where they believe they are still in the real world and not being tortured, and everything goes on as if it was just another normal day. These people would be stuck in their virtual worlds for months and would not be able to WAKE UP if it wasn’t for an anonymous note telling them to WAKE UP, and even then it can take a lot for a person to WAKE UP, if ever, and these people need to PLEASE WAKE UP.</p>

now i’m tempted to hack you computer and delte your Windows. that way, there’s one less person to make a retarded post like that.[/quote]God I hate it when noobs like these guys threaten to hack eachother with prorat or sub7 or any other old-school hacking RAT. Hacking is much more than using some guys work to “hack” someone else (wich makes you a scriptkiddie). You need to learn a language first, I suggest C++ or C# but it is easier said than done because those are one of the hardest languages out there.You can see C++ as an upgrade of C#, it’s little harder but gives you more capabilities. Besides that you need to have a complete knowledge on how the network works with all it’s aspects and what OS your target is running and it’s vulnerabilities. Let’s say you’ve found a vulnerability and succesfully wrote a RAT. There’s one more problem, these days computers are to well secured. Routers for example wich most of us use, won’t let any connection go past them without the premission of the owner so you can forget an active connection, let’s say you’ve past the router of your target somehow, now your against another problem, his firewall, his firewall tries to do the same as the router, blocks all incoming connections that try to connect to your server, so let’s say you get past that too. But now, just when your about to infect the computer, it’s anti-virus deletes every your server eimmediately. Now another problem with windows vista and 7 owners is the windows defender, because before the antivirus does something, the windows defender tries to take action, if he fails somehow the antivirus takes over. Now as you can see the windows defender is actully somekind of antivirus microsoft designed. So the old-school RAT techiniques won’t do the job these days. Now the only way to make a working RAT, is by designing a new code from scratch that the antivirus does not detect, and that doesn’t use a direct connection between 2 computers. Basicly, the techinique that software such as teamviewer use. The antivirus has a database of viruses, if your virus mathces one of those, it will get deleted. Now YOU need to design a peace of software that doesn’t contain in the database of our fellow antivirus. And the antivirus also blocks all incoming connections that try to connect to the computer. There are 2 types of connections, I call them the maker and the player. The maker is basicly the hoster and the player is the computer who tries to estamblish a connection with the maker. Just like in private servers, the hoster needs to PORTFORWARD wich means he needs to tell the router, when someone tries to connect to this port on this ip, just let him go trough, give him a key to open the door. The player however, he doesn’t need to portforward because he is CONNECTING to a server and is not receiving connection. We need 3 connections, 2 players and 1 hoster. The good part is that 2 of the 3 connections are we. We are on of the players and we are the hoster. So what we do is we make a server and portforward it to let all incoming connections go trough and we make a player. Now what our RAT does to infect a computer is, it doesn’t host a server and waits for instructions but it CONNECTS to a server and gives his information to that server, and to do that you don’t need any special permissions because connection is free. Just like I’m writing this message, I’m giving the server information. Now in teamviewer, teamviewer also gives to their main server information but it’s not a simple message, it gives data for remote administration. And the antivirus nor the router nor anything else do not detect this BECAUSE this gives information and does not receive information, they see it as some kind of messenger or somekind of webbrowser. And the information that is received on the main server is then forwarded to the player and that player has now succesfully hacked the person without him or his protection knowing. You need to make ur virus ofcourse a hidden process that autoboots, and that’s how you make a virus. Now all of you noobies, go make a little virus and hack some peeps. Peace out.</p>
