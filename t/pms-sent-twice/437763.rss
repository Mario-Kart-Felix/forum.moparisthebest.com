    <title>PMs sent twice</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pms-sent-twice/437763</link>
    <description>I&#39;m currently developing a client and server for my friend that is based on this:
[url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,520684.html]Zepsity great PI[/url]

and I&#39;ve noticed, when you send a PM, to the user that sent the pm, it looks like it sent twice but the receiving user only receives it once. Also on the quest tab, it says &quot;Players online&quot; that displays the correct amount of users, but doing ::players doubles that count.

Does anyone know of a fix?

EDIT: Fixed the player online bug. If anyone knows about the PM sent twice issue, let me know please.</description>
