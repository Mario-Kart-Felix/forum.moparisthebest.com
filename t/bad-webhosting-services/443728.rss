    <description>Okay now here I just want to start of thread of Bad Webhosting services for your RuneScape Website.


The one I personally experienced is x10hosting.


X10hosting has very poor services. They are constantly taking your website down cause they work on the servers constantly, You think that&#39;s a good thing but when your site is down every week and your databases don&#39;t connect almost all the time, it gets annoying.


I just now recently experienced something horrific from X10hosting today. My whole website itself was deleted from their servers, It was not for suspension or anything like that, literally, every web-page is gone, My account itself is fine, but the web pages are completely gone, now only I have access to it, and a virus or scam is unlikely cause im not dumb when it comes to computers. I know what to expect and what not to expect, but this is just terrible, everything I put together is now deleted for good, and they will not go back a date or anything to get it back.


This is very poor service, and I hope you don&#39;t all make the same mistake i did by choosing X10hosting, I suggest you stick to hostei or some other webhost, even t35 is more supportive then x10hosting.


Thank you for reading, and that is your warning, feel free to post any bad services from webhost below so you can warn other users.</description>
