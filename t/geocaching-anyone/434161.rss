    <title>Geocaching anyone?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/geocaching-anyone/434161</link>
    <description>Any of you lot done it before? I was so bored yesterday and found a thread on reddit about it and then thought fuck it let&#39;s see if there are any near me. Turns out there are quite a few in my town.

By reading the comments on a geocaching website it seems like people urge you to actually be stealthy about finding it so random passers by &quot;muggles&quot; don&#39;t see you placing it back. Some people set out huge adventures for people to go on, for example they&#39;ll give you gps co ordinates to go to then you will find a clue to the next one. A lot of the time it involves code breaking where you might be given a lock but the code is in binary so you have to convert it(obviously there are harder ones).

I went geocaching:

I drove to the first gps co ordinates and the hint was &quot;magnet&quot;. There was a big metal electricity box thing on the side of the road up against a wall, i reached behind it and found the film roll stuck behind it with a magnet. I had to be stealthy because it was school pick up time and quite a few people walking around. I stood next to it and pretended to be texting on my phone and lighting up a cigarette. I opened it and read through the signatures and comments. About 20 people had signed it. This was on my friends road so it felt weird to think at least 20 people have walked along here and stealthily picked it up. I left my signature &quot;brolapse &lt;3&quot;.

My next one was apparently in a bomb crater in a turnip field created by a german ww2 bomber dumping it&#39;s load to get speed over the channel. I drove nearby and I had to jump a fence to get into the field. I walked to the center of the huge 20m wide crater which was fucking hard to walk down. Then realized the gps co ordinates were at the side of the crater. I found another film roll like the last time and I signed it again.

The 3rd and last one was placed near a busy road going out of my town. I went and parked up and walked down a public footpath. The directions said it was behind the building under a tree. I went and found it, it was sort of like a electrical tape bound plastic sandwich container. I opened it up and a fuckton of spiders crawled out all over me.
Here&#39;s what was inside:

I left a pound coin :).

It was fun, but I feel like a retard doing it alone so next time i&#39;m gonna go with a friend and probably bring a joint along. The center of the crator would have been perfect!

tl;dr I like geocaching</description>

I live in a very non-city area (almost all woods &amp; farms), so a lot of the geocaches around here can take hours to find.  But at the same time, it’s nice because they almost all involve a lot of hiking, and take you to really cool places that you’d probably never find any other way.</p>

              <p>I did this last summer just to try it. Had to drive down to a canyon down south of my town and climb down to an abandoned shack. There was a metal box with a bunch of signatures/goodies. Nothing more than some trinkets but there were some sketchpads with mantras on them and what not. I just signed the papers since I couldn’t think of anything to leave behind or bring. Pretty neat hobby but I don’t feel really compelled to do it again.</p>

reminds me of a tradition we have on our moors, you go out looking for hidden tin boxes on the moors and inside the have a stamp so you can stamp your book<br>

fukken retarded farmers sounds as boring as stamp collecting x 10[/quote]</p>
<p>it’s actually a lot more interesting than it sounds, to find the boxes you actually have to go and explore the moors and some are hidden creatively, there’s always some nice sights to see</p>
<p>it’s great that things like this exist without people fucking it up</p>

<p>These types of things are usually get 1 person every month, so it would be hard to wait for someone. Unless you add a trigger at the first location to let you know someone is trying to figure out the puzzle.</p>
<p>Then you can wait and kill them at the last stop</p>

              <p>Any of you lot done it before? I was so bored yesterday and found a thread on reddit about it and then thought fuck it let’s see if there are any near me. Turns out there are quite a few in my town.</p>
<p>By reading the comments on a geocaching website it seems like people urge you to actually be stealthy about finding it so random passers by “muggles” don’t see you placing it back. Some people set out huge adventures for people to go on, for example they’ll give you gps co ordinates to go to then you will find a clue to the next one. A lot of the time it involves code breaking where you might be given a lock but the code is in binary so you have to convert it(obviously there are harder ones).</p>
<p>I went geocaching:</p>
<p>I drove to the first gps co ordinates and the hint was “magnet”. There was a big metal electricity box thing on the side of the road up against a wall, i reached behind it and found the film roll stuck behind it with a magnet. I had to be stealthy because it was school pick up time and quite a few people walking around. I stood next to it and pretended to be texting on my phone and lighting up a cigarette. I opened it and read through the signatures and comments. About 20 people had signed it. This was on my friends road so it felt weird to think at least 20 people have walked along here and stealthily picked it up. I left my signature “brolapse &lt;3”.</p>
<p>My next one was apparently in a bomb crater in a turnip field created by a german ww2 bomber dumping it’s load to get speed over the channel. I drove nearby and I had to jump a fence to get into the field. I walked to the center of the huge 20m wide crater which was fucking hard to walk down. Then realized the gps co ordinates were at the side of the crater. I found another film roll like the last time and I signed it again.<br>
pic on gmaps of the crator:<br>

</div></a></div></p>
<p>The 3rd and last one was placed near a busy road going out of my town. I went and parked up and walked down a public footpath. The directions said it was behind the building under a tree. I went and found it, it was sort of like a electrical tape bound plastic sandwich container. I opened it up and a fuckton of spiders crawled out all over me.<br>
Here’s what was inside:<br>

          </a>
<br>
I left a pound coin :).</p>
<p>It was fun, but I feel like a retard doing it alone so next time i’m gonna go with a friend and probably bring a joint along. The center of the crator would have been perfect!</p>
<p>tl;dr I like geocaching</p>
