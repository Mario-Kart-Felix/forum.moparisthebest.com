    <title>ODACraft.net &quot;Special Forces PVP Factoin Server&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/odacraft-net-special-forces-pvp-factoin-server/462241</link>
    <description>The server is ODACraft.net and the website is ODACraft.com

This server is based off the principles of a U.S. Army Special Forces &quot;Green Berets” Team called an Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA). You will progress through the ranks of a Special Forces (SF) team and earn more commands and privileges.

This server is not for the weak hearted. Mobs are set to hard.

The most realistic approach to combat operations is applied. There is no Obsidian on this server. Water or lava covered buildings are not allowed. Therefore you need to build far away from other factions and defend your base well with TNT booby traps.

There is no chest protection system em-placed on this server, leaving all factions open for fair attack.

You earn money by trapping, breeding, and killing chickens, pigs, fish, and cows. Villagers are known to keep livestock, but if caught by a villager you will be sent to the Prisoner of War Camp.

You can earn diamond kits by passing Airborne School, Mountain School, Scuba School, and the Star Exam (Navigation Course).</description>
