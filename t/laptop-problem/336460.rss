    <title>Laptop problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/laptop-problem/336460</link>
    <description>ok, this is what happened:

i was on my laptop, battery ran out, plugged in the power cord and i though it was charging

bit later a notice poped up and indicated to plug my power cord in, then the laptop went into hibernation.

as for the power cord its lit up, but it won&#39;t charge the battery or provide power, since i tried removing the battery and tried to turn it on, on a direct connection. the power lights on the laptop won&#39;t lid up.

i duno what&#39;s wrong with it, the power adapter is working fine, its light is lit up (near the tip of the jack) but i can&#39;t seem to get power to the laptop. i got this adapter few months ago been perfect.

on the other hand if i put my battery back in t works (well it ons and says battery is very low please recharge). also after i switched to windows 7 my battery failed to hold full charges often a full charge start to last about 20-30 mins. i though it was the battery that was causing this, but even without the battery the laptop should be able to get direct power.

btw its an acer, extensa4120.

if you can help it is very much appreciated. 

thanks in advance (i got my finals and most of my powerpoints/notes are in there so yea)</description>

<p>Make sure all the connections are working and not faulty or something, test for voltage in the charger and just try to isolate the problem</p>
