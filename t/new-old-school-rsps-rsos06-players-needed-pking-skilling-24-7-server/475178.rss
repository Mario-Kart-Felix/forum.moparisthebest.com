    <description>This is a eco based 2006/2007 server. Its still in the beta at the moment with some minor bugs that need to be fixed, But with that said Skilling, Pvm and pking are all working great. Im trying to update the server as much as i can, but i feel its pointless without players. Yes its still a work in progress but if your interested in playing, register on the forums and join the RSOS community, We are also looking for staff, If your interested in that you can find out more in the forum.
Photos can be found on the website.
