    <title>[1.2.5] Dropped In Prison Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/1-2-5-dropped-in-prison-server/444173</link>
    <description>This is a Prison Server made by pokemonzr and Enderbros Productions. I am currently working on adding plugins and adding more things to the server, but you are welcome to join, as we have enough already so you can join.

Levels: We currently have 4 levels of Prisons: A,B,C, and D.

FreeMan: Once you are in A-Prison, when you get 60000 dollars you can apply on the forums, droppedinprison.enjin.com, to be a FreeMan. This means you are out of jail and you can be Free. There are factions, and a bunch of other things that make it fun being a FreeMan.

Guard: Being a Guard is like being an Admin on this server. You have to be trustworthy. You can apply on the forums. You will be a Mini-Guard for a week before you are a guard and we will test out how you do. DO NOT MESS UP THIS SERVER WHEN YOU ARE A GUARD. Being a Guard is a huge responsibility, so think before you do something.

Suggestions: If you have any suggestions, please post them on the forum.

Donations: Donate to help keep the server running and possibly transfer it to a hosting website by going to Donations. 

Thank you for reading this and I hope you will join this fun Jail Server.
