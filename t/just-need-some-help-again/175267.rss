    <description>Sorry about last post, I put it in wrong section. ANYWAY, I was wondering on project czar when people reach a certain lvl like 100 cb, can auto be added to to txt file, so they are member, so we dont have to keep adding. Oh and also, when your ranging to not go right up to the monster, to range from where your standing. If anyone has the answers it&#39;d be ownage thanks very much:)
