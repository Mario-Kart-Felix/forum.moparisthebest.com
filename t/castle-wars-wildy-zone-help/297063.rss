    <title>Castle Wars Wildy Zone help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/castle-wars-wildy-zone-help/297063</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve just finished to code my Castle Wars in my 317. It works perfectly but I can&#39;t attack players in it. How can I make my attack button working in my Castle Wars ? Do I need to get the coords (The coords of my Castle Wars interface) and make a wildy zone with a skull like wild ? I&#39;m confused because I never played RS in Castle Wars so I ask you guy&#39;s what should I do ? Also, if anyone want to give me coords for it or a code of it, it would be cool.

Thanks.</description>
