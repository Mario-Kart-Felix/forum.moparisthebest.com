    <description>In my Server i plan on making a custom called &quot;Crystal Sword&quot;.
I wanted it to look and attack like a Vesta Long Sword but i wanted it to have the appearance like the crystal bow and sheild. I even wanted its spec to look like vls but i wanted it to hit through armor when you use special. Im using delta base so vls is not even in the server and im not sure how to complete my plan.

Somebody please tell me if its possible to do and if so tell me how hard it will be to complete and if you know how to pretty detailed then please send me a private message explaining how it would be done.</description>

              <p>Yes it would be possible.</p>
<p>Difficulty: 6/10</p>
<p>First: If you want a custom item, then you need to either look around the model section [<a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,129.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,129.0.html</a>] to see if someone has released something similiar to what your looking for, o design it completely yourself, theres tutorials in the models section for it.</p>
<p>Second: Once the item is made, it needs to be added properly into the client rotated and zoomed correctly so it isn’t cut off or just look like a big colored square.</p>
<p>Third: You said delta so I’m pretty sure delta handles weapons slots by default, so you would need to handle it server side (bonuses). As far as the special attack goes, theres a LOT and I mean a LOT of unused animations in the cache, so you can look for one there, server side its just an ID and the client handles it from there.</p>
<p>Finally: about it hitting through armour thats just plain ole Java programming and you could probably do it the way specials used to be handled before people developed defence algorithms, just a basic random chance:damage</p>
<p>so instead of the item just using the normal “calculatedamage()” or however its handled you could use something like: damage = misc.random(x) where x is the max damage possible from the item etc etc.</p>
<p>Here are some links for adding vls, try to look at how its done for more details:</p>
