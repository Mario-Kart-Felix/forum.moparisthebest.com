    <title>Moparscape.org will not run</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparscape-org-will-not-run/107522</link>
    <description>I have asked this to many people.  When I downloaded the new JAVA 1.6.0_01  I was following one of those tutorials that said download the latest.  I did mess with system variables.  Any way wen I click on the moparscape link on my desktop(Idownloaded the client thing)It comes up wit a message that says &quot;Can not find Main Class.  Program will exit.&quot;   Someone told me that it was because someone renamed my MANIFEST file.  Does anyone know what that is?  I also try to go to http://www.moparisthebest.com It comes up wit a big white square screen.  It still has the advertisements and the links for server status and the forums.  Really quik a little orange square pops up in the top left hand corner of the white square.  I think it has something to do wit java.  I also tried to play the game called runescape.  When I got to the login screen It is a big white square too.  The same orange square appears in the top left white screen.  I read a help thing on runescape and it says that when u pick low or high detail at the bottem of the screen change the little box from &quot;Signed Applet Using Defualt Java(recommended)&quot; to &quot;Unsigned Applet Using Default java&quot;  And then when I go to the logon screen(name and pass) After about 10-15seconds it will load (slower than it used to b),but it works.  Does anyone knowhow to fix my java or how to use moparscape.  I cant login:(  Please help me.
anbudy want to help me or take a guess.  I cant do much except post without bein able to login</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>First of all, you should re-download Java. A direct link to the download page can be found <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"> here</a>. Select to download “JDK 6u1”. Accept the license agreement and select to download the “Offline Multi-language installation”.</p>
<p>When the download is finished you may want to change your Envirnment Variables. For a tutorial on doing such a thing click <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,56932.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"> here</a>. This tutorial is made by Alexia and full credits are to him.</p>
<p>If you have any problems, concerns/comments please feel free to PM me or post it here.</p>
