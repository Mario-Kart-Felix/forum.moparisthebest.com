    <title>[FIXED] Cook&#39;s Assistant Player Save</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fixed-cooks-assistant-player-save/527132</link>
    <description>I just successfully added the cooks assistant quest from scratch. It works excellently other than the fact that once the server is restarted, the player can complete the quest again. I added into the PlayerSave.java to write the progress in cooks assistant. The result was some messed up things. First, I put the write code for the quest under the write code for the username and I ended up not being able to log in. Then i put it under the quest points and I logged on naked with nothing in my inventory with all level one stats and a skull over my head, and i was still able to complete cooks assistant even though i had done it... Now it occurred to me that I need a bit of code to READ the text file to see what the progress in the quest is. Problem is I do not know where it is located. [RUNESOURCE]

Please if anyone knows please post where it is located and / or how to fix this.</description>
