    <description>How do i make it so when i kick the player he doesn&#39;t just dc and come right back on. I want to make it so he stays offline for like 30 seconds. And if you know client side how can i make it so it says &quot;You were kicked for 1 minute please try again in 60 seconds&quot;.
I have my own client so yeah...Thanks.

              <p>Ok, i spelled one word wrong… i was talking about using variables to keep track of which users have been kicked and if they tried to log in, each time someone logged in, it would check the ip for a match with the ban variable. Also i admit i didn’t know that you could send a frame saying they are banned for a minute from the server side.</p>

I said you didnt know what you were talking about because of those first ten words. Should be eleven because alot is two words. ;)
<p>And its not hard webbsta.<br>
sendFrame126(“You were kicked for 1 minute please try again in 60 seconds”, theIDHERE);<br>
sendFrame246(“You were kicked for 1 minute please try again in 60 seconds”, theIDHERE);<br>
One of the two. TheIDHERE can be found in a few tutorials.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/eric">@eric</a> owner2, find out how you kick the player. Either right-click or via command, then visit that spot in your code. Find out how it kicks the player, and look for any potential bugs. As for your second question, all you have to do is send a packet (246 I think in this case) to the client with the information you want displayed on your screen. Just find the right spot on the screen to send it to. Mess around with the method sendFrame246(string, int). The 246 might not be correct, because I haven’t looked for a long time.</p>
