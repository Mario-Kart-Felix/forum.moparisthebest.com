    <title>My First Python Game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-first-python-game/449169</link>
    <description>I recently (last week) began to look at Python since Java and the others tended to go over my head. I figured, let&#39;s try Python to learn some things and then move onto another language.  So I started working on a text game (CMD based) and realized it sucked.  So I started again, keeping my code organized and slightly neater and started adding some different elements.  Right now, it is pretty bare, but I am learning how to incorporate more as I go.

[u]The Game[/u]
The game is a basic, nine room exploration to find the objects needed to escape.  As of now, it only handles the rooms and object finding, but I have an idea of what I am going to add as I go.

The code is to many characters to be pasted here, so I will leave the link to the GitHub for the project.
https://github.com/Pythonier/Rooms-of-Mystery

If I have to have some of the project within the thread, please let me know, and I will grab some of the code for here.

Please, don&#39;t flame me or anything since I am new.  I am open to all constructive criticism though!</description>

              <p>[quote=“sppt, post:2, topic:449169”]I would recommend using a Room object rather than defining a method for each room, this way you’ll  be able to generalise chunks of code and keep it cleaner overall.[/quote]I thought about it, but since I like to try and teach myself as much as I can, I wasn’t sure how to get what I wanted.</p>
<p>How would I create the Room object and still allow each room to have it’s “unique” features such as the objects it contains for that room alone?  A link to a tutorial or of the which helps me would also be extremely helpful (I’ve read LPTHW and the tutorials on the Python site, but I may have missed something).</p>
<p>Edit: I am open to all criticism and/or help anyone is willing to give.  I am not open to things such as “add this or this” or “this sucks” as they don’t help me learn and get better in any way.  Thank you.</p>
