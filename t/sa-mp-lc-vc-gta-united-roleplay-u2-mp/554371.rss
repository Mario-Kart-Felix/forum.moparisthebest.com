GTA United is simply a modification that consist on having the Liberty City and Vice City map. Which replaces San Andreas for those two, but keeps half of it&#39;s elements such as interiors, vehicles, peds and a few of SA-MP objects.
While GTA United also adds vehicles and skins and doesn&#39;t touch nor replace any of SA&#39;s. 

[U][B]
The server runs on a SEPARATE version of SA-MP. It does NOT use SA-MP 0.3.7, it uses U2-MP as it&#39;s client.[/B][/U]


If you&#39;ve played SA-MP(San Andreas Multiplayer.)then there&#39;s a similarity to this new client here. It actually uses a modified SA-MP to adapt to this one here. 

&quot;[B][I]But SA-MP is a free Massively Multiplayer Online game mod for the PC version of Rockstar Games Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas[/I][/B]&quot;

GTA United Roleplay brings a whole new experience for players who only wish to RP in a east coast setting or vibe such as Liberty City and Vice City.
With updated mapping included. Our mission from the community is to bring as much creativity and much freedom we can give the player with a few rules and what not.

Vice City is the first city you&#39;d fall in, while you still got an option to head to Liberty City or leave as you wish.

From an interactive tutorial to even minor things such as cooking food and more! GTA United Roleplay&#39;s goal is to &quot;bring more CREATIVITY&quot; with a few rules to maintain that creativity and to ensure each player is satisfied.
