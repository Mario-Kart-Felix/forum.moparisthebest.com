    <title>Server Not Connecting Unless Localhost (not a normal problem like port forward.)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-not-connecting-unless-localhost-not-a-normal-problem-like-port-forward/196750</link>
    <description>I have set my server up and not even i can connect to it from my IP address.
Ports forwarded - Yes
Right IP/Port  - Yes
I don&#39;t know if the server is configured to only allow connections if it is local but not even i can connect from the ip.
I really didn&#39;t want to make this topic and look like a noob but i had no other choice becuase i quit runescape servers ages ago and they used to work find ;[
Please, if you know the problem help me and i will try and reward you.</description>

On some servers is there some sort of protection only allowing connections if the server ip they entered is 127.0.0.1 or localhost?</p>
