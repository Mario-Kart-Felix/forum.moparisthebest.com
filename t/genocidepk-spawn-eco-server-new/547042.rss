GenocidePk is a new RSPS created by Paradox. The server is based on Instantly Pking and having a good time doing it. 
For now the server is in Beta. The server still needs a little testing, but we&#39;re getting there. 
We currently don&#39;t have a Website for now. 
In GenocidePk you will log in and Instantly have items waiting for you in your bank ready to Pk. 
There is also a Spawn Tab for people who just want to grab some gear and Pk or you can select an InstaEquip Tab.
Training is not needed in this server, you will be set automatically to combat level 126. 
You will have the option to change your stats if you wish. For those who enjoy the skilling in a private server,
