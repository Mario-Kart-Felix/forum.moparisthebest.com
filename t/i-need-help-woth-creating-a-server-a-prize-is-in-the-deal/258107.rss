i suggest in stead of port forwarding use utorret i couldn’t port forward and i just used utorret all you do is<br>
download it go to files prefrences change the port to 43594 tmake sure the box random port each time in “UN TICKED” then click apply then go to run your server if it say port already in use the go to utorret same part where you change port click random port and apply then when you done that run server it runs fine go to u torret change numbers back to 43594 apply then walla also you need no-ip. duc to get the server ip and  make sure that your server ip is ticked with a smile face next to it and i hope this helped you =) <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
