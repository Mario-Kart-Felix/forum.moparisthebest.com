<p>I don’t like Tom Brady he doesn’t show class. I’ve seen some quarterbacks and coaches drop the F bomb on live tv. It isn’t right, rarely have I seen quarterbacks like Donovan McNabb, Tim Tebow, Randall Cunningham cuss on live tv. You’re a professional football player and you should be held to a higher standard. I hold professional <span class="bbcode-s">quarterbacks</span> athletes to a higher standard and those who have and maintain that positive attitude on and off the field.</p>

<p>Unless you are a professional football player, I don’t think you can really tell what goes on behind the scenes. Football is the ultimate team sport, it’s not like baseball. In baseball, you can hit 4 homeruns and still lose a game.</p>
<p>The great quarterbacks are those who make a mistake and get right back into it. The quarterback is the leader of the team and if he gets down he brings the whole team down. I play football at a highschool level and if you start cussing and yelling at the coach it affects you and it affects the team. It’s alright if you cuss to yourself and say, “damn it man.” That’s fine but you go over to your coach and yell at him, that’s not alright.</p>

<p>True, have you seen sports science? They did something with Jason Pierre-Paul and you realize the caliber these guys play at. If you have a defensive end that is that big, you need to have someone better playing as an offensive tackle, which in the Eagle’s case was Jason Peters who man handled JPP.</p>
