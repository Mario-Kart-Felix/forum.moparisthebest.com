    <title>Commands and Switches?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/commands-and-switches/444572</link>
    <description>Hey guys, so I&#39;m new here, but I just have a simple question that hopefully can be answered to me.

(this is first time coding a RSPS no hate :D )

When looking at the commands.java (PI based) I noticed all the If statements.  Now your most likely thinking, WOW BATMAN!  But I was wondering, why can&#39;t you use switches, or rather why don&#39;t they, when most of the commands are centered around whether or not the player has a certain player rights or donor etc.

For example:

[code=java] if(command.startsWith(&quot;Testing&quot;)){
switch (c.playerRights){
case 0:
// do stuff
break;
case 1:
//do stuff
break;
[/code]

I didn&#39;t finish because you guys most likely knew what I was talking about before seeing the example.  Please explain why if are &gt; switch?

*NOTE: I tested this for a few commands and liked the results*

Please don&#39;t say just for cleaning source with only that as the reasoning.

Thanks,

<p>Well, actually in my base, for some reason, no matter what I tried the commands needed owner status, even when I deleted all of the if(c.playerRights == ) part… I couldn’t figure it out, but after translating the commands into switches, they all worked, and for me I liked it a little better.</p>
<p>But, If for whatever reason, switches makes the source <em>unstable</em> or use too many resources, I would go back to if statements.</p>
