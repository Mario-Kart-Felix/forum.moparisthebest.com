OK, so I am going to soon start working on a new project: Fates-Redemption. I have tried to do this project 2 other times, the first time was good, and then the second time it kind of died. Reason being, I did not have a good development team. I can code myself, and do website development, and some Graphics Designing, but my main focus is the website. I am mainly looking for a server/client developer, and a extra man/woman on the team, who can do a little of both. Once I have a decent team, we can get to work on the project. I already have a domain ( [url=http://www.fates-redemption.com]Fates-Redemption Homepage[/url] ). I still have loads of work to do on the website, and that is one of the reasons I am interested in 1-2 extra people joining the Fates-Redemption development team. If you are interested, reply here, or send me a PM.
