    <title>OpenDNS Beats 20Billion DNS Requests in One Day</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;OpenDNS has been around for quite some time now, I use them myself, though lately I have been messing around with Google’s DNS (since it’s new and well I’m a geek).  Nonetheless, David Ulevitch (OpenDNS founder), just posted on his Facebook and Twitter that yesterday OpenDNS served 20 Billion DNS requests.  That is a single-day record.  You can see it for yourself on the OpenDNS System page (also see screenshot below).

That’s pretty amazing.  As I mentioned I have used OpenDNS for quite some time now and I love it.  It’s an excellent service and I still believe it’s better, faster, and more secure than Google’s public DNS.


Not only does it provide more features but yesterday I added a new subdomain which pointed to another server for bt.gd and OpenDNS had resolved it before Google.  I will be switching back to OpenDNS.  If you haven’t tried it already I highly recommend you check it out.

Congrats to David and the rest of the OpenDNS team for their new record!&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

              <p>I love OpenDNS and have been using it for quite some time now.  Most people have routers they can just plug the 2 DNS servers into and it automatically works on all of your computers.  It’s really fast and has some extra neat features too, I’d recommend it for everyone.</p>
