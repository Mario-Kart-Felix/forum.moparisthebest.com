[size=18pt]You may take whatever you like from this Thread![/size]

Hello, and welcome to the Official Concepts Thread. What this Thread is about, is basically improving upon and adding features/mechanics/content to RuneScape Private Servers. This is the place to post any ideas or thoughts you might conjure about. I&#39;ll go ahead and get the thread moving with these:


&lt;blockquote&gt;Guilds: Guilds are not formed by Players, or even controlled by Players at all. Each Skill has a pre-designated location set aside to be the Guild of the selected Skill. These Guilds require you to pay Dues, complete Tasks, and prove yourself worthy before they will allow you to use their services, or even enter their Guild. Once you enter, you will find that Guilds offer many services and will assist you greatly. You can only be a Member of ONE Guild at a time. If you wish to apply for Membership with another Guild, you will forfeit your current position(Rank)held in your current Guild - even if you don&#39;t get accepted by the Guild you applied for. Guilds can be attacked by rival Guilds, such as the Thieiving Guild (a Dark Alignment) being at war with the Prayer Guild (Light Alignment). If a Guild is successfuly Raided by an opposing Guild, the Players who participated in the Raid temporarily gain access to the defeated Guild and all of It&#39;s Services/Functions.

Guild Ranks: You can perform Tasks, pay your Dues, and Invest into a Guild. Doing this not only helps to advance the Guild, but it will also eventually increase your Rank and Standing with the Guild. This brings great benefits. Here are some current examples of them:

1. Guild N.P.C. will respond differentely (respectfully for example) if you hold a high Rank within the Guild, then the N.P.C. in Dialogue conversations might refer to you as &quot;Sir&quot;, &quot;Commander&quot;, or even &quot;Guild-Master&quot;.

2. Certain Areas of a Guild might be restricted for High-Ranking Guild Members. 

3. Certain Guild N.P.C. can be convinced to adventure with you and add small Bonuses according to their Guild Membership.

4. Investing Coins in a Guild might allow you to gain access to other Services which others cannot. For example, by donating a large sum of Coins to a Guild, they might choose to buy a Furnace and Anvil with the Coins you&#39;ve Invested.


Raiding a Guild: This event can only be done once per day, your current Guild must be opposed to another Guild, and you may not use any Prayer during the Guild Raid. Once you speak to the Guild-Master N.P.C. there will be a screen transition, and you will be near the targeted Guild. You must enter the Guild be defeating the Guards defending it. Once all of the Guards outside have been defeated, the Guard Captain will appear - who drops the Key to the Guild Entrance. Once inside, the Player must survive waves of N.P.C. depending upon several factors including: Investments made into the Guild by Players, the current amount of Players who are Members of the Guild, etc.


Guild-Standing: Standing is how the N.P.C. of a Guild see you. Current Guild-Standing positions:

- Idolized (Highest)

- Exalted

- Revered

- Honored

- Friendly

- Neutral

- Disliked

- Enemy

- Hated

- Loathed&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;Boots of Lightness: When worn, they increase your Run Energy Regeneration speed by 10%. This effect stacks with Agility statistics and the Agility Skill&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;Ring of Wealth: When worn, it doesn&#39;t effect the chance of getting a rare drop from a N.P.C. Instead, all N.P.C. have a 100% chance of dropping Coins upon their death. This Ring requires 90 Crafting to create.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;Beds: All Beds in-game used to serve no purpose. Now, the Player can rest in Beds to restore not only their Hitpoints, but also all of their other Stats and Statistics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;Interactive N.P.C. Text Updates: When a Player gets close to a Boss N.P.C. who is guarding something for example, the N.P.C. will see the Player and have a Yellow Text sentence above their head which will be situation oriented. N.P.C. will also use this feature according to their Special Attacks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;Player Killing: Players will be able to Flag themselves to Enable Player V.S. Player Combat. Once they&#39;re Flagged, they are able to attack other Players ONLY IF the other Player is Flagged for P.v.P. as well. The Flag is symbolized by a Red P.K. Skull over their Player-Character. This Skull doesn&#39;t affect the amount of Items kept/lost and
It&#39;s only function is to show that the Player is Flagged for P.v.P. Players who are Flagged can engage in P.v.P. anywhere at anytime, except during key events such as Minigames, Quests, Cinematics, etc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;Archeology: Artifacts can be found and dug up throughout the Land of Cynosure. Equipment that falls under the Artifact Tier 
requires a level in Archeology to be worn. The dig spots respawn every 8 hours, and there will be many; randomly
generated each day. You can learn to identify statues.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;Archeology Minigame: The player is qued for the minigame. They are grouped with 4 other people. It&#39;s up for the group of 5 to
decide the best way to play the Minigame. You can dig as soon as you begin the Minigame, and have a chance of digging up valuables
or treasure. Or, you can walk further into the collapsing temple, and have a greater chance of digging up treasure, but not valuables.
After a certain time, an earthquake will begin. The players then have a time, which counts down in the corner of their screen, to exit
the temple. If they fail to do so after the time runs out, then they will die and lose whatever they were carrying.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;Player Appearance: Player appearance is not set upon login. Everyone has a default look, and they all change dynamically 
according to their game-play choices. For example, a player with 99 Strength would have large arms.
Each player will start out with randomly selected Hair, Beard, and Clothes. These can be changed at a Barbershop and Tailor.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;Cooking: Players are able to cook Lobster at level 1, Swordfish at level 10, Monkfish at level 20, Cake at level 25, Potato at
level 30, Cheese Potato at level 30, Cheese and Egg Potato at level 35, Egg at level 35, Basic Cocktails at level 40, 
Sharks at level 50, Manta ray at level 60, Golden Sharks at level 75, Advanced Cocktails at level 85, Sea Turtles at 90, 
Enchanted Meat at level 95, and 
Purple Sweets at level 99. The Chef Cooking Outfit can be unlocked via Cooking Minigames. This
involves mixing and serving Drinks and Cocktails, and preparing food for others. Players are able to access the Cooking
Guild at level 70. At level 99, the raw food cooked is given back cooked, but in noted form in the player&#39;s Inventory.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;Food, and Eating: A lot of Servers try to make players Fish for their own Food and have a player-sustained economy for 
Fishing and Cooking. This works very seldom for them. It is boring and pointless on a R.S.P.S. because they have nothing
to work for. Our Cooking and Fishing is designed to flood the markets, give the players a reason to get 99 Cooking/Fishing, 
give new players an easy way to make cash. When players eat 5 Food, they gain a buff to all statistics by +1.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;Cooking Outfit:

Master Chef Hat -    +10% chance to successfully Cook Food.

Master Chef Apron -   +10% chance to successfully mix Cocktails.

Master Chef Boots - Increases energy regain by 25% when the player&#39;s Inventory consists only of raw food.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;Firemaking: Normal logs at level 1, Oak logs at level 10, Maple logs at level 25, Yew logs at level 40, Magic logs at level, 
60, Colored Firelighters at level 70, Teak Logs at level 75, and Bronze Logs at level 85. At level 70 the player can wear 
pieces of the Firemaking outfit, each piece increases firemaking speed by 15%.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;Magic: There are no longer three spell books. The new spell book will be a mix of all three spellbooks combined, but very 
different. This Spell tab contains Utility and Combat based spells. Here is a current list of spells:

TZHAAR SPELL BOOK


(Different randomly selected responses each time a Spell is clicked that cannot be cast because the player lacks the level:


&quot;You lack the knowledge to cast this Spell.&quot;

&quot;You do not have the level to cast this Spell.&quot;


&quot;You need a higher Magic level to cast this.&quot;

&quot;You lack the required level to use this Spell.&quot;

&quot;Your Magic level is not high enough to use this Spell.&quot;

&quot;You must have a higher Magic level to cast this Spell.&quot;

&quot;Your Magic level is too low to cast this Spell.&quot;

&quot;You do not meet the required Magic level to use this Spell.&quot;

&quot;Your Magic level is too low to use this Spell.&quot;)

&lt;blockquote&gt;Loot Tier: Any drop obtained by the player that qualifies as above an Uncommon drop is yelled globally to all players.

- Mundane (feathers, vials, ect).
- Common (rune scimitar, potions, ect).
- Uncommon (abyssal whip, dragon scimitar, ect).
- Quality (fury, dragon chain, zerk ring, ect).
- Rare (dfs, dfh, ect).
- Epic (bandos, armadyl, ect).
- Legendary (godswords, ect).
- Artifact (bronze, gilded, ect).
- Holiday (partyhats, masks, ect).
- Bind on Account (costumes, event rewards, ect).&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;Slayer: Money is mailed to the player once their Slayer task is completed, it takes into account how many enemies were slain, and the difficulty level of the Task you accepted.
Epic tasks are Bosses only.

Easy tasks - 1,000 Coins per enemy slain
Medium tasks - 2,000 Coins per enemy slain
Hard tasks - 3,000 Coins per enemy slain
Epic tasks - 50,000 Coins per enemy slain

The Black Mask will provide a +10% bonus to Strength and Attack when worn and attacking your assigned Slayer Task. The Hexcrest and Focus Sight are also useable during your assigned Slayer Task. The Hexcrest provides a +10% Magic Accuracy boost, while the Focus Sight provides a +15% bonus to Ranged Accuracy. All of these Items are purchasable via the Slayer Point Exchange, which can be accessed via the Slayer Master.
This Exchange is much like the others, and Players can also spend their
Slayer Points on other Items and useful Trinkets and features. Even Cosmetics such as a Pet.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;Bronze Platebody: 

- Allows the wearer to recieve Slayer experience from Slayer monsters without requiring a task. Also doubles the Coin reward mailed to the player for Slayer tasks.

- Functions as a teleport-other to all in-game Instances. 

- Once per hour the player may use the Platebody to negate N.P.C. melee attacks for 10 seconds.

Bronze Full Helmet:

- Functions as a key to all in-game Instances.

- When worn it warns the player of upcoming special attacks from both N.P.C. and Players.

- Can predict the flow of all combat and future combat events.&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;Dropping Bronze Artifacts: When anything Bronze is dropped on the ground, it immediately turns into dust. This dust is often used as a material in high-level crafting for things such as a Fire Bomb. When Bronze Arrows/Bolts are dropped, at least 50 must be dropped at one time in order for them to turn into Bronze Dust.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;Questing: Quests will be divided into four categories: Regular, Epic, Instance, and Raid. Raid Quests will be repeatable and refresh every day, but all other Quests are completed for good once finished. Regular Quests will be able to be completed by everyone at every level regardless. These Quests consist mainly of &#39;Errand&#39; Quests, 
&#39;Retrieve&#39; Quests, &#39;Talk-to&#39; Quests, etc. Epic Quests will be for people who are dedicated to the extreme challenge for the extra edge over the competition, these will be very hard and long Quests which require a lot of patience and persistence on the Player&#39;s part. The Rewards are great and many, and they&#39;re the same for everyone. Daily Quests award different Rewards each time they Refresh, but always at least give Coins as a Reward for completing a Daily Quest.

There will also be some Quests which require mutliple Players to work together to complete. 

There ARE NO AND WILL NEVER BE ANY Quest Guides released. Any sort of Quest Guide or F.A.Q. is forbidden and will be deleted.

Instance Quests are recieved from Quest-givers found outside, inside and around Instances. These Quests are such as Kill Quests for mini-bosses and bosses, retrieval Quests, and more.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;Server Firsts: Not only will there be Easy/Medium/Hard scaled Achievement Diary content, but we are proud to announce Server First
Achievements. These Achievements will be only able to be unlocked by players who accomplish them first. For example, 
the Achievement to be the first player to obtain 99 Fletching. All players can view this task, but only one can complete it.
Once the task is completed, it is also completed for all other players. All players can then click on that Achievement
to view who the first person to reach that goal was. Examples of Server First Achievements: 200,000,000 experience in Cooking,
First Person to Defeat Jad, First Person to obtain a partyhat, ect. Players who complete a Server First Achievement will be
rewarded in three ways.

1. A Scroll (item) delivered to the player&#39;s Mailbox that certifies them as having completed a Server First Achievement.
2. The permanent reminder to everyone that YOU were one of the first people to complete a major Achievement.
3. The ability to click on the Achievement they&#39;ve completed to let everyone around them know what they&#39;ve done&lt;/blockquote&gt;






P.S. No, this does not mean that these aren&#39;t being Developed for Cynosure. If you were told these ideas by a Staffer or Team Member, it just means that you were trusted to hear these first.</description>

I don’t want to do it - I know the way to do it and I do it the way for RSPS the same way that I do it at work, and that’s across more than one language <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> However, you clearly stated that sending server-wide messages would be better if they used “specific client selection” rather than loops, yet you haven’t shown an example of how to use “specific client selection” to send the exact same message to all players at the same time, you have instead given vague answers to questions I haven’t asked.</p>
<p>Also, you said “1. Add a specific I.D. to one client.”, so please don’t correct it to “clients”.</p>

<p>“you resort to name calling”<br>
“you’re a moron”<br>
“you’re a silly goose”</p>
<p>So, you’ve applied a specific ID to one client. Yet, you said that you can send a message to <span class="bbcode-b">all players online</span> using specific client selection. I would like to know how to can send a message to all players online, using the ID you explained in the previous post, without using a loop. There’s no need to be angry, I’m asking questions and not attacking you so I’d like you to treat me with the same amount of respect (you moron, you goose, you silly goose, you silly moron, you moronic goose, etc)</p>
