    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-webclient/450060</link>
    <description>hey everyone i really need some help on my webclient... ive been using JARMaker and i got it to the point where you can run webclient.html... but it says Java is not installed on your machine
 (but it is)
 or your browser does not allowed java applet to run 
get the latest java technology at http://java.com

and then below it says
Internet explorer restritced this webpage from running scripts or activex controls. 
and then it has an option to allow blocked content but then it says error click for details but when you click it freezes please help me... i got my hopes up that i was making a webclient then poof.</description>
