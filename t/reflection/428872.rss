    <description>This isn&#39;t about Java Reflection, but about actual reflection of light.

So today I was minding my own business while on a bus. Dutch buses, like most buses, have front and mid-way doors. The mid-way door has a glass pane perpendicular to it. Because of height differences in the bus (the floor in the back is higher than in the front), the glass pane reflects. So I was sitting behind someone, and as I said minding my own business. But every time I looked at that glass pane, I could see right into the eyes of the person in front of me. It seemed as if this person was looking at me, and when I looked at it we were looking in each others eyes. 

So that got me wondering: If I recall correctly, then reflection works both ways. If I were sitting in both seats at the same time, I would be looking into my own eyes. Am I right, or was this person looking at something completely different?

Look at image below what I mean, use of wrong terms might be confusing.</description>

<p>I wasn’t sure about it. Luckily, it was a nice looking girl but it still pisses me off when people are staring at me. I assume she was staring at me because I’m smoking hot <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
