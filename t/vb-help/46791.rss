<p>Is this your first attempt at learning a programming language?  If so, I strongly recommend starting with something else.  While being an extremely easy language (one of the easiest I have ever worked with), it isn’t a good starter language.  It allows sloppy coding to work fine which teaches you very little.  The best thing you will walk away with is basic programming logic.  The code is not case sensitive, you don’t have to declare types, and it’s not even the latest VB available.  The IT department at the company I work for doesn’t even allow our programmers to write in <a href="http://pre-VB.net" rel="nofollow noopener">pre-VB.net</a>  My point is this: VB is a nice language for doing incredibly helpful things, incredibly fast.  But it should not be your first stepping stone because there are no other languages similar.  <a href="http://VB.net" rel="nofollow noopener">VB.net</a> is VERY different from VB6 and the knowledge gained from learning VB6 won’t help you very much with <a href="http://VB.net" rel="nofollow noopener">VB.net</a>  If you really want to know a language, you will want to go with something like java or C because the way the code is written is very similar to so many other languages.  At first I didn’t care for it much, but I’ve become a huge fan of java.  The code is very clean and very easy to read.  And since I’ve worked A LOT with javascript (not the same as Java, but yet again the code formatting is pretty much the same) and PHP, the jump to Java was very easy to make.  Sure, they might be more difficult than VB6.  But the fact that when you learn the structure, you’ve learned the structure for many languages, spending a little extra time at the beginning is worth the benefit in the long run.  but when you learn the style of VB coding, you’ve only learned the style of 1 and a half languages.

<p>Lol, theres no way in hell one should start with C/++. But I agree, VB* teaches very bad coding practice, so Java would be a good start.</p>
<p>That’s what happened to me, I started in VB6, and had VERY bad programming logic (didn’t use arrays correctly etc.), so it made it a big pain in the ass to start learning C++, and took me a while to start doing things the <span class="bbcode-i">right</span> way.</p>

<p>and my “real” programming began with VB3, I regretted starting with VB when I started learning other languages.</p>
