---Eating---
When you are holding a 2h it has the animations i think. so like its hanging in air and ur cape is moving. anyways when u eat food or potions it doesnt show the animations of it eating/drinking . it just shows nothing.


---Cooking---
Iv had 2 problems with this.
1. There is no cooking timer so it cooks the whole inventory in like 2 seconds. how can i add.
2. This has happened to 2 characters. wherre they are cooking and it randomly goes like black screen and logs them out. then when they log on it gets stuck on loading-please wait. and the only fix i can do it change the character look on the files. which is very annoying. ( if you need more details please tell me)

Thanks</description>
