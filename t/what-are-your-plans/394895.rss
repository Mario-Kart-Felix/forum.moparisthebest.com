    <title>What are your plans?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-are-your-plans/394895</link>
    <description>This is about studying. Basicly, I wanted to make a thread to know what you guys are studying.


This is mine:


My English sucks so bare with me.


I&#39;m in 4th grade in highscool studying marketing and economics.
The next 2 upcoming highschool years I&#39;m going to study programming managament in the same highschool.


After that I&#39;ll be 19 and I&#39;ll start my bachelor at Digital Arts And Entertainment. 
There will be 2 options, 


[b]Major Game Development and Major 3D Arts,[/b] 


[u]Major 3D Arts[/u] has very little programming and is mainly high poly advanced animation and modeling for commercials, games, movies,...


[u]Major Game Development[/u] is mainly programming: you learn advanced C++, SQL, and some other languages. You also get modeling and animation but far less than Major 3D Arts, you basicly learn to make game ready models and stuff. You learn every single thing about 3D and you learn to make your own 3D applications from scratch and you learn to work with the PS3, XBOX360,... well when I&#39;ll be doing this there will be probably a PS4 and and XBOX720 and the NGP and some more.


Oh yeah, I&#39;m going for Major Game Development. After I finish that, I will be 21 years old.


Then, I&#39;m not done yet, I&#39;m going for a master diploma, but that turns into an universitair diploma in 2013. So, I will study 2 more years to get that in Electronics-ICT. They will basicly turn me into a hardware/software IT-engineer.


I will be 24 years old when I will fully complete all of this. It will take me 7 years to accomplish this and I will.




[size=5][b]So, what are your plans or what are you currently doing?[/b][/size]</description>

<p>BUTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT OT - Funny you should ask this question today! I actually spent around 7 hours getting signed up to start college in Fall, via a program we have here called Running Start. Basically you can get high school credit and college credit for just a college class, so you can get your HS Diploma and credits toward a degree at the same time. It has high prerequisites though, so it’s hard to get into. Basically I’ll have an AA Degree at the same time I get a High School diploma! I then plan to transfer over to University of Washington, and get a higher degree in computer software/science, which should only be 2-4 years. Then I plan to get a job!</p>

I plan on either going into a physics field or a psychology one. As a freshman, there aren’t too many classes to aid with that, so I’ll have to take courses relate to my fields of choice later on.<br>
[/quote]Physics as in?[/quote]Thoeretical physics, astrophysics, etc.</p>

<p>The best part of the job is that you are very independent, and it’s different every day. You are home dispatched, meaning you wake up in the morning and check your work orders on the internet, then go do them. You don’t deal with any bosses, and then come home when it’s all finished. You get paid for a full day if you finish early, but don’t get paid extra if you stay late.</p>
<p>I was given a work truck to keep at home, a laptop, and a blackberry. Lovin it[/quote]That seems really awesome, I mean really awesome, especially the independent part.</p>
<p>Me however, I’ll probably work for a company for like a year, get some money together. AND THEN open my own company doing game development, hardware, software,… I’m not sure what exact. But that’s my dream, owning a big company.</p>

              <p>This is about studying. Basicly, I wanted to make a thread to know what you guys are studying.</p>
<p>This is mine:</p>
<p>My English sucks so bare with me.</p>
<p>I’m in 4th grade in highscool studying marketing and economics.<br>
The next 2 upcoming highschool years I’m going to study programming managament in the same highschool.</p>
<p>After that I’ll be 19 and I’ll start my bachelor at Digital Arts And Entertainment.<br>
There will be 2 options,</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Major Game Development and Major 3D Arts,</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Major 3D Arts</span> has very little programming and is mainly high poly advanced animation and modeling for commercials, games, movies,…</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Major Game Development</span> is mainly programming: you learn advanced C++, SQL, and some other languages. You also get modeling and animation but far less than Major 3D Arts, you basicly learn to make game ready models and stuff. You learn every single thing about 3D and you learn to make your own 3D applications from scratch and you learn to work with the PS3, XBOX360,… well when I’ll be doing this there will be probably a PS4 and and XBOX720 and the NGP and some more.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I’m going for Major Game Development. After I finish that, I will be 21 years old.</p>
<p>Then, I’m not done yet, I’m going for a master diploma, but that turns into an universitair diploma in 2013. So, I will study 2 more years to get that in Electronics-ICT. They will basicly turn me into a hardware/software IT-engineer.</p>
<p>I will be 24 years old when I will fully complete all of this. It will take me 7 years to accomplish this and I will.</p>
<p>[size=5]<span class="bbcode-b">So, what are your plans or what are you currently doing?</span>[/size]</p>
