    <title>US Soldier Not Allowed Pentacle on Grave Stone- Oppinions?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/us-soldier-not-allowed-pentacle-on-grave-stone-oppinions/22877</link>
    <description>Recently there has been a soldier (Sgt. Patrick Stewart) who died in Iraq. He and his wike practiced the pagan religion, Wicca. The symbol of this religion is the pentacle, which is a star with a circle around it. He is getting the plaque on his grave stone, but the government hasn&#39;t even approved it. I myself find this a breach in the US constitution, and George Bush is taking us closer and closer to the burning times, where witches and wizards had to lie to their friends and family and destroy their hard made alters. I don&#39;t expect anyone else on this forum to be Wiccan, but before you post your oppinion, remember, this is a dead soldier  that died for his country and all he wants is a plaque on his grave.</description>

              <p>Mopar, there is a lot of differences in Catholisism and Christiantity. Also, in no way is Wicca satanic, Wicca teaches good nature towars others and part of the Wiccan rede states that what ever you do comes back to you threefold, and also that as long that it harms no one, go ahead an do it. Yes, according to the 1st ammendment, there is nothing wrong with ngraving your religous symbol on a grave. Also I can garuntee that this would not be an issue if it was a Christian soldier. Thanks for all the posts everyone.</p>

<p>And freedom isn’t so simple. There are still lines. If you want freedom, see anarchy.<br>
So, naturally, it’s hard to figure out the lines.</p>
<p>And as far as separation of church and state, I feel the founders instated that more to keep government out of religion instead of visa versa.<br>
I don’t think they’re so much worried about this single instance, but rather the future instances… since it could lead to more obscure engravings. So they need only limit it to what is publicly acceptable. (so no porn on ur tombstone :()<br>
This would offend many people, but I see nothing wrong with it.</p>

<p>That’s true. Pagan is mostly used as a derogatory term.</p>

<p>Either way, everyone knows that although there is a seperation of church and state in the USA, the country was founded by christians, and therefore most of us have christian values.  He knew that when he enlisted in the army as well.</p>

              <p>Recently there has been a soldier (Sgt. Patrick Stewart) who died in Iraq. He and his wike practiced the pagan religion, Wicca. The symbol of this religion is the pentacle, which is a star with a circle around it. He is getting the plaque on his grave stone, but the government hasn’t even approved it. I myself find this a breach in the US constitution, and George Bush is taking us closer and closer to the burning times, where witches and wizards had to lie to their friends and family and destroy their hard made alters. I don’t expect anyone else on this forum to be Wiccan, but before you post your oppinion, remember, this is a dead soldier  that died for his country and all he wants is a plaque on his grave.</p>
