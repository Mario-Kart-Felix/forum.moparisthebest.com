    <title>The best defense?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-best-defense/394403</link>
    <description>Recently i&#39;ve been interested in securing my home from people trying to break in to steal my valuables in Minecraft and the thoughts of an &quot;impenetrable&quot; fortress are extremely attractive for me. What would be, in your opinion the best form of defense against the outside intruders? I did a bit of research on this and most ideas I came across are aimed at keeping mobs out, ideas such as the floating fortress, or submerged or perhaps the underground fortress. The only problem with these types is that left in their simple form they are open to attacks from other clans perhaps, and also griefers to wander into.

Some ideas I did look at were a bit interesting but being honest most of them are flawed since they only involve sticking lava inbetween your walls and having a classic &quot;3-layer wall&quot;, which can easily be stopped by a block or two of dirt.

What i&#39;m interested in is seeing what you guys have come up with, or perhaps have thought of and you think it would be effective? I&#39;m not asking yous to post lovely detailed diagrams of your precious defenses, but if you&#39;re willing, a nice description would do!</description>

10 block wide walls of Obsidian, then dig under your house or w/e and add more obsidian.

And yes, you <span class="bbcode-i">can</span> get through, but it is much harder and takes much longer than just a normal wall.  Plus when you make a ‘bridge’ like that over lava, for some reason the ‘bridge’ block seems to randomly catch on fire.<br>

I considered that, but you could still always get through by pouring a bucket of water there turning the lava into cobblestone. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  So it works out the same.</p>

There is no fool proof defense, but you can make a pretty decent one that generally kills someone the first time they try to enter (because they don’t know your defenses) and that is for all intents and purposes impenetrable when you are at home.  (since it is so hard to get into there is no way people can come at you from multiple locations, and you can shoot them with arrows while they are still trying to get in)</p>
<p>Since I haven’t had time to play much lately, I’ll just go ahead and tell you how I built my latest castle.  I built a wall around it the size and shape I wanted, then next to that wall I dug all the way down to bedrock (took weeks).  Then on the other side of the pit I built another wall.  These walls extend all the way to the very top of the map (to the bedrock), as the top block I used a fence, since you can’t jump over them, in the middle I placed lava so it would flow all the way from the top block to the bedrock, and you can’t build a block over top of it since it is the top block itself.  I have a door sized hole in one of the walls so I can get in and out, with an iron door on the inside controlled by a switch.<br>
[/quote]Heh, I see a problem. But first, how wide is your pit between the 2 walls? (and how did you get so much lava &gt;.&gt;)[/quote]<br>
It’s unfortunately just 1 lava wide, it already took me weeks to dig that down to bedrock.  The purpose is that you cannot dig down under it, and that you cannot build up over it with a dirt tower or similar.  Of course there are ways to get through the wall, but none of them are really good <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>As to the lava, I planned on building an entire inventory of buckets and traveling half a minecraft day to a above ground lava pool, but I lucked into a huge lava lake almost down at the bedrock level, so I filled my lower bar with iron buckets, built a ladder from the bedrock to the top block, (and made the whole 2 wide, with 2 ladders on both sides at bottom, so I could fall all the way to bedrock without being hurt instead of climbing down), then just kept climbing up and falling down, refilling my buckets at the bottom, and dumping them at the top.</p>

<p>cool. i was thinking of making a small one too, that shoots faster and has a counter that counts then stops when it reaches the set amount. that would probably be a complex circuit but i dont think it would be that hard.</p>

Saw that before, was pretty fun.<br>
I had some ideas for protecting your house. First, Don’t put it out in the open; or at least if you will, make parts of it underground. This is especially fun if you’re being chased by someone, and you’re just driving them right in the places of your traps.</p>
<p>Abuse the fact that redstone can reset liquid flow. This is very useful to do with lava, and iti s also useful to do with water, if you really want to keep the drops. You can even do this with a nice pressure plate infront of a chest with signs that say something like “diamonds and valuable shit” pointing to it, then have the lava flood the room using redstone. Also, you might have noticed you need a block above a chest to open it. You can put some block above it with some liquids above that block, making the guys die by lava.</p>
<p>As far as I can see, dispensers are pretty useless when trying to trap someone. The sounds are just too distinct and they are too easy to avoid imo. The only use of a dispenser I can think of is if you use snowballs to push someone in a pit of w/e.</p>
<p>So, theres my two cents.</p>

              <p>I like to take advantage of the fact TNT doesn’t do damage to bricks on Moparcraft, meaning it can be placed on your property without risk of damaging your belongings. I usually put pressure pads or traps near entrances (Or places I know they’ll try to get in). Also, if I know I’m going to be under attack I some times invest in a land mine system.</p>
<p>The land mines are scattered near my property to disperse incoming waves before they reach me, I know they’re coming because I also have a very big tower which can see anything coming for miles. This method also creates confusion and shock among the attackers meaning the attack is somewhat damaged.</p>
<p>Also, the 3 block wall method can not only be used for lava but with TNT and pressure pads also. It’s just costly <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>Recently i’ve been interested in securing my home from people trying to break in to steal my valuables in Minecraft and the thoughts of an “impenetrable” fortress are extremely attractive for me. What would be, in your opinion the best form of defense against the outside intruders? I did a bit of research on this and most ideas I came across are aimed at keeping mobs out, ideas such as the floating fortress, or submerged or perhaps the underground fortress. The only problem with these types is that left in their simple form they are open to attacks from other clans perhaps, and also griefers to wander into.</p>
<p>Some ideas I did look at were a bit interesting but being honest most of them are flawed since they only involve sticking lava inbetween your walls and having a classic “3-layer wall”, which can easily be stopped by a block or two of dirt.</p>
<p>What i’m interested in is seeing what you guys have come up with, or perhaps have thought of and you think it would be effective? I’m not asking yous to post lovely detailed diagrams of your precious defenses, but if you’re willing, a nice description would do!</p>
