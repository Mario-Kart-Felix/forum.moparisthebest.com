    <title>Adding New Character File Variable (Delta)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-new-character-file-variable-delta/432104</link>
    <description>Hey guys.
I am adding a means in which players to tell their favourite colour. I know this is wierd, but it is for good reason. I have been fine up to the point of saving the value of String variable faveColour. I wish to add this string to the character files so that the favourite colour of each individual player is retained when they log out and back in. I have followed the template of other variable within the character file such as the character-beard. I used this as a template to ensure that the same thing happened to the colour variable. There are no errors, the favourite colour input just doesn&#39;t save after a player logs out and back in. Could somebody please explain this. Variable faveColour is declared upon player input. Then they log out, and back in and it hasn&#39;t retained their favourite colour. The file just says &quot;character-faveColour = &quot;. No matter what I do it won&#39;t save, even though I do it the same as already existing saved variables. All help is appreciated. Thank you.</description>

              <p>Thank you for all your assitance. It turns out I declared the variable within client.java as what its original value should be (""). And it occurred after declaration of the players favourite colour.</p>
<p>Thank you whackatre.</p>

              <p>[quote=“razorback, post:3, topic:432104”]I have done both of those I can assure you. And it does save. It just doesn’t grab the variable from the client.java. In player.java donator is declared as false. And when it becomes true in client.java, it just saves to the character file. I followed the exact same format as the donator variable. Where donator is declared as false, I declared faveColour = “”;<br>
This just declares it. Then when faveColour = “green”; within client.java, it doesn’t save to the file. Even though it is in the load AND save methods, along with donator (which works fine). When i set my favecolour as green it tells me in the server “Your favourite colour is green”. Which proves that the variable is being assigned that value properly. It just doesn’t save it. When I open the characterfile after doing that is just says:</p>
<p>Favourite-Colour = “”</p>
<p>Thank you for you assistance and time.</p>
<p>Further help is appreciated. :)[/quote]</p>
<p>Show the part on Favorite-Colour in the save method plox. You probably messed up with substring.</p>

              <p>Two spots you need to add the variable. The loading method, and saving method. Search other variables in the files such as ‘donator’ if you need any further help.</p>
