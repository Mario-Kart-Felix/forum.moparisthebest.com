    <title>Basic server with silab?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/basic-server-with-silab/158333</link>
    <description>I need a basic server with preety much nothing in it because i want to put all of that in myself. The only think i want is for it to have Silab. Because i dont know how to do that, nor do i want to do it. It is possible that someone could past the URL to DL one, or give the name and a general place that i could find it.


                                                                                               THANKS</description>
