    <title>508 - Frames</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-frames/326827</link>
    <description>Before you read this, I would like you all to know, if you do not know how to code, or have little experience, then please leave.

Hi guys, I just recently created a new updated to my server, that has alot of coding with frames. As you can see, here&#39;s one of my [b]Frames.Java[/b] methods:

[code]    	public void ResetGEItem(Player p, int slot) {
		p.stream.createFrame(137);
		p.stream.writeUnsignedByte(slot);
		p.stream.writeUnsignedByte(0);
    	}[/code]

However, whenever I use this frame, (it works) except I logout everytime it&#39;s used. Say I put this method in a command, to test it, or if I talk to an NPC and have this method used while talking to that NPC, or even if I put this method for when someonme clicks an object, you would automatically logout.


Can someone help me with this? Is it the methods used, or is it just a frame type error? ~ Thanks, much appreciated.</description>
