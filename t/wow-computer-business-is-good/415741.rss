    <title>Wow....computer business is good?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wow-computer-business-is-good/415741</link>
    <description>Well basically I started my own business minus the store front for the big city im in and I looked and theres only about 10 other computer repair business (charging big fees). I set up a site, put a classified in the newspaper, posted on craigslist and had my friends in the neighboring city spread the word. I&#39;ve been accepting jobs for 2 days and i&#39;ve already made around $400 doing simple work and these people thought what I was charging was cheap! I charge 40 dollars for a job while some business are charging $40 for diagnostics fees! 

The hardest thing I had to do so far was find a vista disk to use the repair wizard to fix a startup issue where it wouldn&#39;t boot and the lady payed me $45 and scheduled me for next week to backup her data and reformat her computer?

holy shit.

tltr: im gonna be rich</description>

Ooo great information thanks it has only 32k for the shutter count, the camera was used by a real estate magazine company for 360 photos of house so its body is in great condition also. Thanks for that information it definitely helped me know where I stand in pricing as I don’t know much about cameras.</p>

<p>just a note, the d100 is a very old camera and the prices depend on the shutter count, you can find that out by taking a picture of a camera and it should be in the exif data</p>

Thanks for that information, I listed it on craigslist for $250 and 8 people emailed me in 4 hours then I noticed it had a Tokina SD 12-24 F4 (IF) DX which apparently is worth the $250 just for the lens judging by the prices on ebay. So idk do you know anything about Tokina lenses? The pictures actually look very good but I guess I should stop just taking crap loads of pictures if it depends on shutter count.</p>

<p>Yeah it should be pretty easy for you then especially if its smaller because word spreads fast and you will have basically a monopoly unless other people start.</p>

<p>This. They aren’t “scamming”, they’re running a business.</p>
<p>Yes, some kid who spends his time on forums and playing Runescape could fix it for free. But those people don’t have business expenses or bills to pay, or travel time to take into consideration, or the time spent on the phone, or…</p>
<p>It’s like when people complain about the high price of programming consultants. Yes, the guy charged you £200 an hour. The reason he did that is because he spent 3 hours for every 1 billable hour on your project doing stupid shit like answering your phone calls at 8am in the morning and deciphering what “I need the interface to pop” meant.</p>

              <p>I completely agree with you when you say that low-skill jobs are important too. In the western world, more and more don’t want to do low-skill jobs, which is a good thing IMO. The higher skilled a population is, the more they earn and this all stimulates both economical and scientific growth. The focus shifts from basic necessities to knowledge. I also think it’s not that bad that Eastern European workers come to our country to do non-skilled jobs. They earn more than they do over there, and the jobs here get filled too.</p>
<p>But my problem is the rates of the average computer repair shop. I’ve been an intern in one, albeit only a week. But during that week I witnessed the complete randomness on which they base their prices, and the huge margins between hour wages and what is charged. I doubt the average employee earns €140,- an hour. So not only the customer is ripped off, the employees are cash cows themselves.</p>
<p>The course required for an average job in a computer repair shop takes 2 years. I’ve never had any computer related courses or even lessons, except one to teach me to type with 10 fingers and one mandatory Excel module. Yet with the help of the internet and the guts to actually open up a pc I can fix just about any computer problem the average person runs into, without it taking ages.</p>
<p>After reading this ‘rant’ again, I understand it’s stupid. The point is, that even though the average person could do low-skilled jobs, they pay others so they don’t have to it themselves.</p>

<p>Computer repair shops are the biggest scam out there. They charge even before they do shit. Most of them are filled with people who take a two year course that consists of assembling computers.</p>

<p>While I know what you’re saying this seems like the wrong way to look at it!</p>
<p>I mean you go to a barber not because you couldn’t cut your own hair, but because you don’t want the inconvenience of doing so.</p>
<p>I know women who go to nail salons, now I’m pretty sure most women know how to do their nails too.</p>
<p>This logic may be applied to any low skill job. I only disagree with charging before they do shit, that seems a little wrong, but it’s making a living. Just like everyone else. The fact it takes a couple of years to learn? Well that’s why they aren’t really high paid jobs. (TBH I think most courses could be done far sooner than that <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> and most university degrees these days are total nonsense too).</p>
<p>The fact is to most of “us” (mitb-ers) these computer jobs seem easy, but to the people who only use their computer for browsing the net and MS office they really aren’t and can’t be doing the the hassle.</p>
<p>EDIT: Just wanted to mention, I’ve volunteered in such a shop and done these jobs free for months. Earning someone else money. £30-40 repairs that take me 30-60 minutes tops. Computer builds that sell for £50 above cost that take half an hour to put together… so glad my days of doing that are over. If only volunteering made me feel good it might have been worth it. (I don’t even have a 2yr computer course qualification :P)</p>

<p>Your right! Because obviously I am somehow able to avoid the sales tax I paid on my vehicle and the licensing fees I have to pay every couple years, all of which go directly towards maintaining and building public roads.
