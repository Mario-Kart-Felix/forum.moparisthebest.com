    <title>Semantic HTML</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/semantic-html/477011</link>
    <description>So I noticed a few posts here don&#39;t follow, what I believe to be an important convention, semantic HTML. A lot of new tags have been introduced in HTML5 for pure semantic reasons (think &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;header&gt; and &lt;nav&gt;) and it&#39;s something you should be considering on your next project. Semantic HTML isn&#39;t just about tags though, your IDs and classes should also reflect meaning.

When you write your HTML, don&#39;t use tags based on their style. Tags should reflect document meaning rather than style. HTML5 has &quot;obsoleted&quot; and deprecated a lot of elements (such as [url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/big]&lt;big&gt;[/url], [url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/center]&lt;center&gt;[/url], [url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/font]&lt;font&gt;[/url]) and attributes (background, frameborder, bgcolor) for this reason (http://www.w3.org/TR/html5-diff/#obsolete-elements). All of what these elements do can be better achieved in CSS.

Avoid tags like [url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/b]&lt;b&gt;[/url] (this can be used but only as a last resort), [url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/i]&lt;i&gt;[/url] and [url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/strike]&lt;strike&gt;[/url] but don&#39;t blindly fallback to using [url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/strong]&lt;strong&gt;[/url] and [url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/em]&lt;em&gt;[/url] as alternatives without thinking about what sort of text you&#39;re trying to describe. Use &lt;em&gt; for emphasizing text, not just because you need the text to look italicized. Same with &lt;strong&gt;, use it for strongly emphasizing text, not just because it makes the text bold.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is often confusing to new developers why there are so many ways to express the same thing on a rendered website. Italics and emphasis are perhaps one of the most common. Why use &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; vs &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;? They produce exactly the same result right?

Not exactly: emphasis is a logical state, and italics is a physical state. Logical states separate presentation from the content, and by doing so allows for it to be expressed in many different ways, perhaps instead of rendering some text as italics you want to render it red, or a different size, or underlined, or even bold. It makes more sense to change the presentational properties for &lt;em&gt; than it does for italics. This is because italics is a physical state; there is no separation of presentation and content, making italics do anything other than italicize text would be confusing and illogical.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I also suggest to avoid the &lt;br&gt; tag to create gaps in the page. It doesn&#39;t provide any meaning to the page and a better, more maintainable result can be achieved using CSS&#39; margin on block elements.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Do not use &lt;br&gt; to increase the gap between lines of text; use the CSS margin property or the &lt;p&gt; element.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If you need certain elements to have specific styles, use class names to describe what they [b]are[/b], not what they look like. Doing this makes the page a lot easier to maintain, search engines to crawl and TTS readers to parse.

Something like:
[code=html]
	&lt;span class=&quot;green-text&quot;&gt;$40.00&lt;/span&gt;
[/code]

Doesn&#39;t describe what &quot;$40.00&quot; is, rather what it looks like. Use a more appropriate name like the following:
[code=html]
	&lt;span class=&quot;price&quot;&gt;$40.00&lt;/span&gt;
[/code]

The code above describes exactly what the class represents and can be styled accordingly. This also makes your website more maintable if you ever decide to change the colour of the price.

When writing your page, use tags that are more specific to what you&#39;re trying to describe before using more generic tags. An example would be something like the following:
[code=html]
	&lt;span class=&quot;label&quot;&gt;Username&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;input name=&quot;username&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;
[/code]

The same could be done instead like:
[code=html]
	&lt;label for=&quot;username&quot;&gt;Username&lt;/label&gt;
	&lt;input id=&quot;username&quot; name=&quot;username&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;
[/code]

Which makes a lot more sense because the &lt;label&gt; tag describes what &quot;Username&quot; is (a label for the username input), rather than a generic tag like &lt;span&gt;.

Another common thing I see is something like the  following:
[code=html]
	&lt;a id=&quot;amazing&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Do Something Amazing&lt;/a&gt;
[/code]

[code=javascript]
	document.getElementById(&#39;amazing&#39;).addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, function() {
		console.log(&#39;You did something amazing!11!&#39;);
	}, false);
[/code]

This causes unexpected behaviour when users may try to copy the link or open it in a new tab. It&#39;s the wrong tag for triggering events in JavaScript, use a &lt;button&gt; tag instead. Buttons can be styled however you want, that&#39;s what&#39;s great about CSS.

This is why HTML5 offers tags like [url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/header]&lt;header&gt;[/url], [url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/footer]&lt;footer&gt;[/url] and [url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/nav]&lt;nav&gt;[/url]. These tags make a lot more sense than the generic &lt;div&gt; tags we&#39;re used to. That isn&#39;t to say that you shouldn&#39;t use &lt;div&gt;, just try to find a tag to better describe the content its holding before resorting to it.

This is a great page on using semantic HTML and the new semantic tags:

TL;DR
Don&#39;t convey style or functionality in HTML, just the structure and content.</description>
