    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rics-webclient-problems/372004</link>
    <description>hi I&#39;m fairly new to coding but i know a bit ( mostly about the client sided part of a server ) of java, i tried Ric&#39;s web client tutorial as best as i can to set up my own web client, my desktop client works perfectly fine though just for some reason my web client will download the cache correctly then unpack it and bring up my background and will say connecting to update server but then it gets this black screen and say &quot;sorry, an error has occurred whilst loading EliteScape Client&quot; and I&#39;ve gotten this error and regular Runescape and other private servers a few times before, if anyone has any solutions please post them and if the suggestions work and your willing to play my server you will be giving co-owner status and have complete access to all of the custom&#39;s I&#39;ve added in and their pretty cool, or if you would rather take like 10$ from any donations i receive, i would happily send you the money in return for help, by the way any posters with actual help will get rep++ if they tell me how, sorry i haven&#39;t been on MoparScape for to long and don&#39;t really know a lot XD, anyway any and all help would be appreciated, thanks =D.
