    <title>[JXGC] XML to GUI- and Object-creation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jxgc-xml-to-gui-and-object-creation/231999</link>
    <description>Hello!

As I have been creating a tool recently with which you can create both Objects and setup GUI:s via XML-parsing, I wanted to hear some feedback on this... Whether it would be a great idea to continue on it, or not (perhaps if others that are better/more flexible already exists?).

When I have searched on the matter, I havn&#39;t really found alot of tools... The one I found was SwiXML, but that was only ment for creating of Swing-GUI:s. However, as said, mine can create almost all (all that does not require what my program lacks (will name some of these drawbacks later on)) Objects.

As I don&#39;t know yet whether this will be released open-source, or not, I can atleast show you some of the stuff... A sample picture and the XML-file that created it.

Here is the picture:

Here is the XML-file:

     public static final void main(String[] args) {
          new JXGCExampleApp();
     }
}[/code]



First I will mention little about what can be done:

You can create Objects through their Constructors, but _only_ if the drawbacks mentioned later on does not apply. Also, if you have already created an Object, you can (if done correctly), re-use that Object as parameter-argument for another Object, by specifying the syntax &quot;${ID}&quot;, where &quot;ID&quot; is the ID for the referenced Object, to the Value-attribute of the new Object. You can also do the same with the Class-attribute, but this only copies the class-name from the referenced Object to the new Object, so you don&#39;t have to re-write it (usually only if it is a long name etc.).

Also, another good thing is that you can call on methods on the particular Class (no static ones (that I know?)), in which you currently are in the XML-document.

If you fail on anything, an Error-message will be created, and you can create your own ErrorHandler Objects to handle Errors according to your own liking. The default ErrorHandler writes the Error-messages to a Container, which in turn will be written to a unique filename on the specified path determined by the Log-attribute in the main-Element, or &quot;.&quot; if not available... When done, it will close itself.



Now I will mention little about the drawbacks:

You cannot create an Object that have a Constructor which requires an Array of any type as parameter-argument (almost finished, but not quite yet).

You cannot create an Object that have a Constructor which requires another Class that can only be instantiated through a method as parameter-argument (Singleton comes to mind).

You cannot create an Object that have a Constructor which requires another Class that can only be accessed via a field in that (or any other) particular Class (constants comes to mind).

You cannot (yet) receive values from getter- (or accessor-) methods, to apply on other Objects. Neither can you call on static methods (that I know, never really tested :)).

Hope to hear some feedback, although it isn&#39;t open-sourced... Maybe it will be someday?</description>

              <p>Yz85Racer: Well, this very project have been put aside on my project-schedule, but, it won’t be fully gone. First I thought I had messed up the code, and didn’t know what to do to fix it. Then I decompiled a working version and compared the source code between these versions. There were no changes to the new version, which indeed worked, so I tried it once again, and it suddenly worked again (I have no idea what happened earlier).</p>
<p>But today, I got much better plans. My object-loader package which I were first trying to make to be able to create this GUI-creator, that I couldn’t create before, have now been created, and still needs to be fixed. But since I managed to do that, I have plans on creating a whole new language, which I also plan on expanding to cover easy GUI-creation. That is where I stand today.</p>
<p>These plans have merged because I didn’t feel comfortable with the XML-creation of GUI:s. It would take too long to create a nice program, unless I made a standalone program using some kind of nodes etc. to create this XML-file (by adding data to text-fields etc.).</p>

              <p>Wrong again moparscape4life…</p>
<p>I can tell you more properly how it was… The part with the scam was kind of correct, however, it all started with BobDole81, Zerratar, RLN and perhaps some more (I don’t know about that), who all made a server. This server was the predecessor to Geminus.</p>
<p>Then BobDole81 finally decided to re-create it from scratch once again (as the motivation was decreasing from some of the team-members), but this time better. This is the Geminus most of us know about these days, however, not the final one.</p>
<p>Me and sw0o0sh were creating and maintaining a site, for my own server back then. But it suddenly became the new home for Geminus, as BobDole81 agreed to have it hosted for testing on this site, while he was going on vaccation, so he knew what bugs to fix when he came back home. He came back home, but was less interested in the development of the server, and after a while quit totally.</p>
<p>Before he quit, he gave me a version of this server that had alot of bugs fixed, and many features added (mostly the features we had half-assedly added to the hosted one already). This version was never (and still have not) ever been released. The only people who got it, is me and BobDole81 (that I know of). But technically the people who have MoonSpell have it aswell (atleast indirect), because MoonSpell was based on top of that very version of Geminus.</p>
<p>Yz85Racer: As stated previously in this topic, yes, I am Protosstribe.</p>
<p>Also, there are another nice site with LAFs, which is where I found JTattoo:<br>

<p>Never heard of Tattoo myself, but it looks pretty good.</p>
<p>And I know that the component’s UIs can be updated like that, but its a nasty way of doing it. The LAF is added during initialization, and all components displayed after the LAF change have that Look And Feel. Some components won’t adjust if they are already displaying (even if you call their updateUI() method).</p>

<p>Or do you instead mean that I should have different LAF’s on different JComponents at the same time? If this is the case, I will just have to add an attribute to the Object-Elements that can tell us whether to change the LAF for that Object in particular (or just wait until I can actually call on static methods etc.).[/quote]</p>
<p>You’re scripts are parsed and then run in the initialization part of the program. Activity is not enabled until after the script is run through. Look And Feel changes must be done before user interface objects are displayed (so, basically, in the initialization part of the entire program). Thus, to change the LAF, you need to do it inside the script. And also, it seems you have not changed the LAF in the Swing package before. It is done statically through the class, UIManager. It has nothing to do with JMenuItems and is a pain in the butt when run through an external plugin, but still is possible. As long as the LAF Jar file is included in the classpath and the same parameters apply for the method call, it should load. But any way you slice it, you need to modify the LAF through UIManager, thus needing access to call a static method during the initialization of the program, which is in your script.</p>

<p>You said your script doesn’t support static references, so you couldn’t technically change the LAF of the Swing package.</p>

<p>Unhandled: Thanks for the tips… But none of these are Java? Well, JavaFX is somewhat, but not real Java, is it? I havn’t really checked up on it, because I don’t really need it.</p>
