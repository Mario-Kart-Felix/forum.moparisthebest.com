    <title>Model corruption, please help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/model-corruption-please-help/291669</link>
    <description>Hey, I decided to do a recolor of spined armor. (Please don&#39;t flame because of the fact I recolored it). I have only added one, the plate body/body. I am pretty sure I did everything correct, but i think that there may be something wrong with my ints for the item. So, added my model into my models folder in my client. I made the model numbers 9800 for the drop/inventory model, and 9801 for the male/female wield model. I corrected my ints as far as I know, and before i put them into class8.java I went in game and wrote this: 

[code]add model 9800
add model 9801[/code]

It said the models were added successfully so that would not be the problem. Then I added my ints to class8.java. This is them:

[code]	if(i == 14789)
	{
	class8.aStringArray189 = new String[5];
	class8.aStringArray189[1] = &quot;Wield&quot;;
	class8.anInt174 = 9800;
	class8.anInt181 = 1140;
	class8.anInt190 = 460;
	class8.anInt198 = 0;
	class8.anInt204 = 0;
	class8.anInt169 = -1;
	class8.anInt194 = 4;
	class8.anInt165 = 9801;
	class8.anInt200 = 9801;
	class8.anInt188 = -1;
	class8.anInt164 = -1;
	class8.anInt175 = -1;
	class8.anInt197 = -1;
        class8.aString170 = &quot;Sagen Platebody&quot;;
        class8.aByteArray178 = &quot;A dark, intimidating piece of armor.&quot;.getBytes();
	}[/code]  

Not sure if there is a problem with my ints, but I think that is were the problem is coming from. 
Then I went in game and added it to my inventory. My game froze and didn&#39;t unfreeze. It said this in my client runner (not compiler) after my client froze:

[code]Exception in thread &quot;Thread-7&quot; java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 62459
        at Class30_Sub2_Sub2.method421(Class30_Sub2_Sub2.java:328)

        at client.run(client.java:5387)
        at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)
[/code]

If anyone can see any problem, I would really, really appreciate their time and help. 

Thanks a lot.
