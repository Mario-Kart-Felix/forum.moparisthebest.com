    <description>I dont know if this is the right place to post so if it its sorry and please move (:

Ok so now I was just bored and decided to make a little tutorial on basics of java programming!
I have a feeling that people are going to be saying bad stuff about this but I dont care.
Im just doing this to HELP people out who are new. I know that this is very little and BASIC but it gives them an idea of what Java Programming is like.

Hope this helps!! :D

[code]public class MyRsps {

             public static void main (String[] args) {
                 System.out.println(&quot;My first Rsps code&quot;);
                 System.out.println(&quot;I love Java&quot;);
            }

}[/code]

This line of code names the class and either makes it public to people or not
[code]public class MyRsps {[/code]

[code]public[/code]
means that it is public so everybody can access it

[code]class[/code]
This is a class
In object-oriented programming, a class is a construct that is used as a blueprint to create instances of itself referred to as class instances, class objects, instance objects or simply objects

[code]MyRsps[/code]
This is the name of the class

[code]{[/code]
you need a bracket all the time after you name your class

This line names the METHOD
[code]public static void main (String[] args) {[/code]

[code]public[/code]
yet again so anyone can access

[code]static[/code]
static means that the variable or method marked as such is available at the class level. In other words, you don&#39;t need to create an instance of the class to access it. But this is a little more advanced for beginners

[code]void[/code]
it&#39;s a mandatory option in this case otherwise there should be a &#39;return&#39; at the end of the method.
the main which is giving the project entry point is a typical &#39;no return&#39;
method.

[code]main[/code]
Name of the method

[code](String[] args)[/code]
This method must be given an array of Strings and the array is called &quot;args&quot;

[code]{[/code]
Another open bracket of the method

[code]System.out.println[/code]
This tells the computer to print to standard output (it defaults to command-line)

[code](&quot;My First Rsps Code&quot;)[/code]
This is the string you want to print

[code];[/code]
Every statement ends with a semicolon to end the statement!

[code]System.out.println(&quot;I love Java&quot;);[/code]
Is the same thing as above

[code]}[/code]
Closing bracket of the main method

[code]}[/code]
Closing bracket of the class name (MyRsps)

I could do another tutorial on what you can do in the main method but at the moment I am to lazy to do! If you appreciate and would like me to I would gladly! :D

I hope this is some what good info for you beginners!

Also the FASTEST way to learn is to go to the library or store and get a Java Programming book! It teaches you everything you need to know! Thats how I learned and probably most people! 

REP++ would be appreciated :D</description>

              <p>very nice explanation.</p>
<p>Although you only teach people how to echo text, You should add on to that by teaching about arrays and switch() functions, and simple data types (int,double, char, boolean…ect).</p>
