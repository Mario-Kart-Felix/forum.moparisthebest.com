    <title>Would anyone be interested</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/would-anyone-be-interested/403375</link>
    <description>Hello, so i am comming to a big decision today, and want to know what the mopar community thinks about this, so im the owner of Mi-Webs webhosting as many of you know, and today, i was offered a deal for a VPS license to Resell vps&#39;s so im wondering, if anyone would be interested in this, if so let me know in a post,the Starting vps will be around $11.99 for a Windows Server and $10.99 for a Linux server, and eventually i will buy a root reseller where i can actually make VPS&#39;s myself. So let me know what you think, this is not a cheap decision as it will cost alot of money so i need to know if anyone is interested or not.

Thanks
