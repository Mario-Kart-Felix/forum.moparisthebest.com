    <description>Hey Guys, not been here on Mopar for a while now, just came to see how things were going, looked over some stuff, noticed that the popular 317 of last year, is now the 508. 

Well, good job to whoever decoded the cache for it. 

But im here to ask some serious stuff. 

--

I want to get back into this, while i&#39;ve been gone, i&#39;ve been working with a game called Garry&#39;s Mod. (Some of you may of heard of it.) And it&#39;s addons are scripted in Lua. 
I want to start working in Java again. 

My main question, is this. 
What Base should i use to start off again? Is Dodian around on 508&#39;s? If it is, tell me. 
What Files do we use nowadays? Is everyone just using Notepad or have people moved on and started using other programmes. Such as Notepad++? (Which i use)

Basically, i want to know what i&#39;m going to need, to get started. 
( I DONT WANT TO MAKE A SERVER, I JUST WANT TO CODE IT, SO DONT GO TELLING ME SOME CRAP ABOUT PORTFORWARDING ETC ETC.)

Thanks, Moo.</description>
