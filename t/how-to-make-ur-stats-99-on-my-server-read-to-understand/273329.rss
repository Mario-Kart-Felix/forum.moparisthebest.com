<p>The number’s 0-24 are the skill number’s</p>
<p>The first number, On here, Is 1 Witch is the level, (One is 10 but thats the Hitpoint’s) The secound number is the xp, For a 99 skill put the xp as 14000000 This will make both numbers for that skill 99 when you log in.</p>
<p>For a ::master command (Delta based)</p>
<p>Add this under another command in the server in the file, Client.java</p>
<blockquote>if(command.equalsIgnoreCase("master") &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 2) {
for(int i = 0; i &lt; 21; i++) {
addSkillXP(14000000, i);
}
}</blockquote>
<p>For a ::pure command, Add this the same way as you do the ::master command,</p>
<blockquote>if (command.equalsIgnoreCase("pure") &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 1) {
            addSkillXP(14000000, 0); 
            addSkillXP(0, 1); 
            addSkillXP(14000000, 2); 
            addSkillXP(14000000, 3); 
            addSkillXP(14000000, 4); 
            addSkillXP(0, 5); 
            addSkillXP(14000000, 6); 
            sM("Your Now A Pure Pker"); 
        }	   </blockquote> 
<p>Where it says  &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 1) {</p>
<p>That means Anyone with player rights above 1 (Excluding mod’s) 0 will enable it from mod+</p>
<p>Try that, Thanks</p>
