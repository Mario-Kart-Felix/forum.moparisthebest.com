&lt;blockquote&gt;Here&#39;s a tragic but oddly humorous news story; it seems that the voice actor behind the Serious Sam games has fallen on some hard times financially and is now hiring himself out to fans in an effort to combat his debt. 

John J. Dick, who as well as doing the voice of Duke Nukem-alike Serious Sam also works part-time as a DJ in a strip club, claims that his major money worries have driven him to prostitute his vocal chords to gamers and is now hiring himself out at $1 per word. 

&quot;I&#39;m in debt... bad. $20,000 in credit card debt, bank overdrawn, behind on bills, etc. Got burglarized back in February, so I don&#39;t even have anything left to show for my debt,&quot; Dick writes on ViolenceMedia (which is a bit NSFW). 

&quot;It&#39;s a long story how I got into this situation, if you&#39;re curious I&#39;ll tell you the details. Point being, though, I&#39;m in a position where I&#39;m desperate to pay my bills off in any way I can. I don&#39;t particularly want to start s***ing c**k for rent money, so here&#39;s what I&#39;m gonna do for you. Super budget discount voice acting.&quot;

Dick has now launched a simple service on the site where users submit phrases to him at the low price of $1 per word and he&#39;ll send them back to you. Fancy having him as your voicemail message? No problem - there are only two rules. Firstly, Dick says he&#39;ll only be doing thing until he&#39;s fought off his debt (so you&#39;d better act quickly) and secondly, he doesn&#39;t want to do anything that would jepordise his relationship with Serious Sam developer, Croteam. 

&quot;The only real limitation I have is that I reserve the right to not &#39;do&#39; the Serious Sam persona (use his name and specific &#39;voice&#39;),&quot; clarifies Dick. &quot;That doesn&#39;t mean that I won&#39;t do the Serious Sam voice in some situations, your voicemail message or somesuch. It&#39;s just that Croteam and the Serious Sam franchise have been very good to me. I&#39;m not going to do anything that would compromise my relationship with them.&quot;

If you&#39;re interested, Dick also claims to be a capable copywriter, audio editor and flash designer - and he&#39;s willing to work on any number of projects for a good price. Let us know if you hire him out in the forums.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
