<p>hey i’m a complete asshole. i go into threads, insult newbies…do NOT help them at all and feel better about myself.<br>
i started out as a newbie too, got better and now that i have some experience, i feel like instead of not insulting newbies(like i was when i started) I’ll continue the role of the ‘experts’ and insult them for my own personal pleasure.</p>
