Seriously. And I believe it too. The mafia no longer has many traditional vices (gambling, prostition) as they have been taken over by the government and corporations (legalized gambling, porn). And it makes sense they would move into any new field where there&#39;s plenty of money, the internet is full of it.


&lt;blockquote&gt;5: Extortion – this is one of the big time mob moneyspinners. They infect computers with zombies – often paying unscrupulous hackers something like 20 cents per infected PC – until they have many thousands of infected computers – and then they block access to a major site by having all those zombie PCs access it simultaneously. Depending on circumstances they deliver an extortion demand before or after the attack. This technique has been used successfully against offshore gambling sites and with mixed success against all kinds of other sites. Demands are typically kept in the $50,000 range to make it easy for companies to pay rather than lose business.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Wow, that&#39;s inspiring.</description>
