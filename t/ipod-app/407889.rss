<p>Lol no…android is a whole different operating system…ios = apple (ipod, ipad, iphone) and android = android.<br>
<a class="mention" href="/u/rune">@rune</a>… I just told u that apple is kinda breaking its relationships with adobe and doesnt support adobe flash cs5 made apps…And yes HTML5 is wayyyy better then flash for reasons that include no downloading extra plugins, html5 is faster, easier to code and is better supported then flash (facebook, twitter all use it and the reason is many mobile phones support html5 and not flash (take iphone for example(it never supported flash even when apple liked adobe (which was for such a short period of time (now how many brackets do i have to close???)))))</p>

              <p>I just found this information out today.</p>
<p>Apple apparently isn’t going to support adobe on any of their devices anymore. That means no more YouTube or anything that runs with flash. This means war between Adobe and Apple. Apple actually used Photoshop when they made their graphics. And since HTML5 supports a lot of flash, Apple is basically cutting their throats. Also I heard when you download Apple products, it gets into files that have nothing to do with what they were made for.</p>
<p>I have gotten all this information from my Grandfather, and yes, he does know what he’s talking about. He codes the site for the <a href="http://wvhighlands.org/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">West Virginia Highlands Conservancy</a>.</p>

I am not encouraging this but xcode can be downloaded from torrents also (im not sure if posting bout torrents is allowed or not so any mod feel free to delete this part). And as i said earlier u dont need the p12 certificate to publish apps from xcode so u can make (and publish and send apps to cydia) without having any apple account (wether its itunes or the dev acoount u dont need it)<br>
Btw u need a mac/hackintosh for xcode (sorry thats the only way)</p>

i got xcode for free, did they change it?<br>
[/quote]<br>
No xcode is free u have to pay to submit apps to the appstore (wheter if its a free app or paid one)<br>
@ the person asking if u can make games: u can make anything (the only limit is ur imagination)<br>
@ the person who said u have to give ur credit card to get an itunes account: u csn actually get it without givibg ur cc info (google how to do it)<br>
@ the person who said use adobe flash:</p>
<ol>
<li>i tried making an app once and its a pain in the ass</li>
<li>Apple does not support it anymore</li>
<li>To publish the app (meaning to get the completed app in ipa format (iphone os format)) u need a paid($99 per month) dev account’s p12 certificate, wheras with xcode u dont need the certificate[/quote]@ the person = RuneWings317  BITCH! xD</li>
</ol>
<p>And I know about the game, I said it was a derp question. And when I went to download the Xcode thing, it said I needed to get the big bundle shit thing… And I’m glad you told me about the adobe shit, cause now I don’t need to waist my time downloading.</p>

Actually you can make a game for ipod/iphone without the $99 apple dev account. Apple has a free dev program to where you can download xcode for free (which is needed to program for ios) however you can’t release it to the app store without having the paid dev account. But if you really wanna release your app release it in Cydia (only for jailbreakers)<br>
I have xcode 4.1 and a free apple dev account<br>
[/quote]<span class="bbcode-s">Will this make games?</span> &lt;–Derp Question xD</p>
<p>Edit: If I would happen to release it on the App Store and my primary group is Free Applications, will I still be able to have some ingame stuff that they have to pay for? And I’m guessing when I sign up I don’t have to pay for it until I post on appstore right?[/quote]</p>
<p>You can try, but you need an apple account which requires a credit card at creation</p>
