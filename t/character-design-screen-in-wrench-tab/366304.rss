    <title>Character Design Screen in Wrench Tab?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/character-design-screen-in-wrench-tab/366304</link>
    <description>Ok, this is pissing me off.
Inside the wrench tab, there&#39;s another screen, like, overlapping it. Please help, i need this client to work.

And PLEASE try to stay away from &quot;it&#39;s a client-sided problem.&quot;
I KNOW that, i need to know how to FIX it.
