[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-i">An RSC Gaming Experience</span>[/size]</p>
<p>[size=10pt]SnoSaven Gaming Company is officially announcing the development and production of an entirely new and original gaming server.  Development is now underway and will continue over the next 3 to 5 months.  The anticipated release date is January 1, 2012.</p>
<p>This totally unique server features some drastic changes from RSC and many original ideas such as:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Landscape:</span><br>
The landscape on this game will be, as estimated, 26 times the size of the current RSC world.  This entire landscape will be 100% customized and 100% different from any RSC source code.  Towns, roads, rivers, etc. will all be entirely new.  We’re currently still coming up with ideas on how to make it easier for players to travel around this huge landscape.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">NPCs:</span><br>
This game will feature 100% new NPCs and monsters.  There will be at least 3 times the amount of NPCs here as there are in any other RSC server, each with unique attributes, capabilities, and immunities.  Levels of the attackable NPCs range from level-1 to level-1330 and all have a completely custom look.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Skils:</span><br>
There will be 38 skills featured in this game.  There will be the usual skills (Strength, Defense, Attack, Health, Ranged, Magic, Prayer, Woodcutting, Firemaking, Mining, Smithing, Smelting, etc.) as well as new skills (Adventuring, Necromancy, Building, Trapper, Runemaking, Thievery, etc.)  The maximum skill level is 99.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Quests:</span><br>
Currently, we have 68 quests written and have plans for at least 100 more within the first year of the server’s life.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Items:</span><br>
Every single item on this server will be completely customized.  There will, however, be certain items that are the same (which need to be, i.e. buckets, pots, iron armor, weapon types, armor types, shears, jugs, etc.)  Currently we have 6 types of armor and weapons which will require different attack, defense, strength, magic, and prayer levels to wield and use.  More are in the works.  Herbs will be customized, all items will have new looks, new functions, etc.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Graphics:</span><br>
On this server you can expect the same graphics and feel as original RSC.  No changes will be made to the graphics.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">F2P/P2P:</span><br>
Eventually, we will be opening up a subscription system for those who want access to more quests, skills, monsters, items, etc.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Miscellaneous:</span><br>
Client Window: The client window will be full screen with a section dedicated to your toolbar (inventory, spells, prayers, chat, clan chat, global chat, private chat, quests, tools and settings, etc.)  This section will be on the bottom of the screen.  On the right hand side will be your map and a section that will be dedicated to a toolbar item of your choice.  The left hand side features 2 sections for toolbar items of your choice.  Here, you can customize which windows will be constantly open for your convenience.</p>
<p>Clan Chat:  Clan chat will be initiated eventually.</p>
<p>XP Rate:  The XP Rate is totally customizable.  From x1 to x99 for non-subscribers and x1-x120 for subscribers.  This allows for ultimate customization of skill levels and leveling speed.</p>
<p>Website:  The website (will be open by November 1,) will feature forums, a blog, website chat with friends, highscores, webclient, clan pages, staff pages, event pages, photo albums, customizable profiles, links to sites and resources, etc.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Get ready for a whole new RSC experience!</span><br>
This is by far my greatest undertaking and I really hope this server will take off one day.  I have always wished for the RSC world to be bigger and more in-depth and now I can finally say that it will that way soon.  Keep checking back here for updates as I will be posting them daily.  Thanks for reading this, and happy Runescapin’!</p>

[/quote]Still seems dumb to me. You’re going through all the trouble of making models, landscape, whatever else. The rsc client isn’t even big… and to avoid intellectual property infringement you’ll have to change more than just the graphics… I think their protocol is patented as well? I don’t see what advantages there are in using rsc as a base for a whole new game - just a headache and possible legal issues. Assuming your mind is made up and if you’re spending a lot of money, I would suggest that you seek legal council as there are probably a bunch of little things that you don’t realise.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes their protocol is patented as well, however I have spoken with my lawyer and discussed these matters and both he and I feel comfortable that once this game is fully developed, no intellectual property rights will be at all infringed upon.  Basically instead of creating my own source code from scratch, I am using an RSC source code so I can fully test everything from day 1.  By the time all the changes are made, the game will no longer be recognizable to an RSC player nor will the protocol and coding be in violation of infringement laws.  The basic graphics stay the same, but how they are built will be completely different.  Also, Runescape is written essentially all in Java and this game is being written with various other languages including integrating Java with C++, etc.</p>

<p>Lol why make the landscape even bigger.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Not enough people in RSC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You said to RLN above that you are changing everything so this will not be like RSC? That obviously will not happen because you are obviously clueless and retarded enough to make a landscape 26x the current RSC map when you currently have 0 players. The game will not instantly have thousands online thus having such a big map it will seem empty and no one will care.</p>

<p>You should really change some ideas and thoughts around and post something realistic.</p>
<p>The fact that you want to add all them new skills and shit is just crazy. Why are you using the RSC game engine to do all this? You are setting your self back further.</p>

<p>Not enough people in RSC?  True, but this game isn’t intended to appeal to only RSC players.  This game gives those RSC players the same feel as RSC, but gives anyone who wants it a new gaming experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lot of the new space is being used for dungeons and quest locations.  Even then, it is still massive, which is why we are coming up with things like ship building, etc. to ease the transportation problem.  The idea of the massive landscape is to explore it and use it to your advantage (certain areas will be PVP, certain areas will give you skill XP in different skills, etc.)</p>

<p>Sure it sounds like a huge undertaking, but the result is going to be worth it.</p>

<p>Lol there is only so much someone is going to want to explore on a Runescape Classic map. It does not make sense what you are trying to advertise. If it is the same graphics and RSC feel, YOU WILL NOT GET NEW PLAYERS.</p>
<p>Trust me bro you need to rethink your project. Kids now a days are not going to play it unless you improve the graphics which makes me wonder why you want to use RSC as a base if you are wanting to do this. This is going to fail horribly and you really need to rethink it. Change your plans and turn it into a <span class="bbcode-b">Runescape Classic Private Server</span> if that is what you really want to do. Do not over complicate it.</p>
<p>26x bigger than rsc map is a fucking big map as well.</p>
<p>Also at Jessekins, Why do you keep making lots of accounts on moparscape?</p>

<p>Obviously you fail to grasp anything I am saying.  It is going to appeal to both RSC players and new people who want to try a new game.  Also, if I wanted to make a typical RSCPS, I would make one, don’t you think?  This isn’t typical RSC, it’s not even RSC, it’s a whole new game that appeals to both new and old players of Runescape and other online games.  If you think it’s going to fail, that’s your right, but don’t call me a retard for wanting to develop something original.</p>

<p>Obviously you fail to grasp anything I am saying.  It is going to appeal to both RSC players and new people who want to try a new game.  Also, if I wanted to make a typical RSCPS, I would make one, don’t you think?  This isn’t typical RSC, it’s not even RSC, it’s a whole new game that appeals to both new and old players of Runescape and other online games.  If you think it’s going to fail, that’s your right, but don’t call me a retard for wanting to develop something original.<br>

<p>Developing something that has the Runescape Classic feel with the map 26x bigger than the original one really does sound clever.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m not going to try and explain this to you because you obviously don’t understand it.  Once I begin in-game testing I will post pictures so you can see how it appeals to both RSC and other players.</p>

<p>“The landscape on this game will be, as estimated, 26 times the size of the current RSC world.  This entire landscape will be 100% customized and 100% different from any RSC source code.  Towns, roads, rivers, etc. will all be entirely new.  We’re currently still coming up with ideas on how to make it easier for players to travel around this huge landscape.”</p>
<p>Lol why make the landscape even bigger.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Not enough people in RSC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You said to RLN above that you are changing everything so this will not be like RSC? That obviously will not happen because you are obviously clueless and retarded enough to make a landscape 26x the current RSC map when you currently have 0 players. The game will not instantly have thousands online thus having such a big map it will seem empty and no one will care.</p>

<p>Can you explain to me in how you are going to go about into improving RSC graphics. Without the graphics being improved or gameplay I don’t need to see pictures to know having 26x map will work. It will never work.</p>
