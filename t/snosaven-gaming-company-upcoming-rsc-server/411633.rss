    <description>[size=14pt][b]SnoSaven Gaming Company[/b][/size]
[size=12pt][i]An RSC Gaming Experience[/i][/size]

[size=10pt]SnoSaven Gaming Company is officially announcing the development and production of an entirely new and original gaming server.  Development is now underway and will continue over the next 3 to 5 months.  The anticipated release date is January 1, 2012.

This totally unique server features some drastic changes from RSC and many original ideas such as:

[b]Landscape:[/b]
The landscape on this game will be, as estimated, 26 times the size of the current RSC world.  This entire landscape will be 100% customized and 100% different from any RSC source code.  Towns, roads, rivers, etc. will all be entirely new.  We&#39;re currently still coming up with ideas on how to make it easier for players to travel around this huge landscape.

[b]NPCs:[/b]
This game will feature 100% new NPCs and monsters.  There will be at least 3 times the amount of NPCs here as there are in any other RSC server, each with unique attributes, capabilities, and immunities.  Levels of the attackable NPCs range from level-1 to level-1330 and all have a completely custom look.

[b]Skils:[/b]
There will be 38 skills featured in this game.  There will be the usual skills (Strength, Defense, Attack, Health, Ranged, Magic, Prayer, Woodcutting, Firemaking, Mining, Smithing, Smelting, etc.) as well as new skills (Adventuring, Necromancy, Building, Trapper, Runemaking, Thievery, etc.)  The maximum skill level is 99.

[b]Quests:[/b]
Currently, we have 68 quests written and have plans for at least 100 more within the first year of the server&#39;s life.

[b]Items:[/b]
Every single item on this server will be completely customized.  There will, however, be certain items that are the same (which need to be, i.e. buckets, pots, iron armor, weapon types, armor types, shears, jugs, etc.)  Currently we have 6 types of armor and weapons which will require different attack, defense, strength, magic, and prayer levels to wield and use.  More are in the works.  Herbs will be customized, all items will have new looks, new functions, etc.

[b]Graphics:[/b]
On this server you can expect the same graphics and feel as original RSC.  No changes will be made to the graphics.

[b]F2P/P2P:[/b]
Eventually, we will be opening up a subscription system for those who want access to more quests, skills, monsters, items, etc.

[b]Miscellaneous:[/b]
Client Window: The client window will be full screen with a section dedicated to your toolbar (inventory, spells, prayers, chat, clan chat, global chat, private chat, quests, tools and settings, etc.)  This section will be on the bottom of the screen.  On the right hand side will be your map and a section that will be dedicated to a toolbar item of your choice.  The left hand side features 2 sections for toolbar items of your choice.  Here, you can customize which windows will be constantly open for your convenience.

Clan Chat:  Clan chat will be initiated eventually.

XP Rate:  The XP Rate is totally customizable.  From x1 to x99 for non-subscribers and x1-x120 for subscribers.  This allows for ultimate customization of skill levels and leveling speed.

Website:  The website (will be open by November 1,) will feature forums, a blog, website chat with friends, highscores, webclient, clan pages, staff pages, event pages, photo albums, customizable profiles, links to sites and resources, etc.

[b]Get ready for a whole new RSC experience![/b]
This is by far my greatest undertaking and I really hope this server will take off one day.  I have always wished for the RSC world to be bigger and more in-depth and now I can finally say that it will that way soon.  Keep checking back here for updates as I will be posting them daily.  Thanks for reading this, and happy Runescapin&#39;!

[b]UPDATE LOG:[/b]
Monday, August 22, 2011: Posted the official announcement on Moparscape, developing the forums, working on tweaking the source code, dedicating desktop computer to temporary server for testing of the game server.

Tuesday, August 22, 20011: Fiddling around with OpenGL to get myself reacquainted with it, designing log-in screen, developing forums and website, exploring different ways to enhance graphics.</description>

However: lack of developers or lack of determination seem to be the cause.</p>

<p>Who ever claimed i said i was afking? I’m talking about when you play the game, not sit in one spot waiting for npcs to attack you. Of course you won’t get any exp, just like you wouldn’t if i came to the same spot you were on rscemulation i could bring 5 accs to your spot and lower your exp…</p>

<p>The RSC map is already small, it’s just a pain to navigate because the only real quick transportation is teleporting, and even then you have to walk.  Quests would open up different teleports, portals, and modes of transportation like boats, carriages, etc.  It’s only big if you have to walk it.</p>

<p>I hope this is a joke lmao… The rsc is huge compared to the player base that plays. You do realize the Rsc servers had like 1k+ on them when it was open and even then it wasn’t crowded.</p>
