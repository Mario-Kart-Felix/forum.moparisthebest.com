              <p>It’s pretty complicated and may be impossible in lower revisions (I’m not sure if they have the proper methods to generate maps server side and the client accept them)</p>
<p>But depending on your playebase size, you could probably write a system to sell the actual houses in RS, prices based on how many tiles in space they are.</p>
