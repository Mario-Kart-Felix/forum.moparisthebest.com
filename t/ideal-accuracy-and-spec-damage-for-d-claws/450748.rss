    <title>Ideal accuracy and spec damage for d claws?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ideal-accuracy-and-spec-damage-for-d-claws/450748</link>
    <description>I have never thought of the best accuracy for weapons. D claws, probably the most expensive items on servers, are sometimes really overpowered or really underpowered. What do you think the ideal accuracy and spec damage is?

As you can see, mine suck:

NOTE: The person I attacked was 1 defense as it is a pures server.</description>

              <p>As far as the special damage goes, I don’t see anything on RS Wikia that says the special offers extra damage. It’s just 4 normal hits that happen very quickly.</p>
<p>Accuracy should be a problem that applies to your entire combat system. People usually train strength with the idea that it will allow them to win in fights. Based on a good combat system, though, accuracy is way more important. I consider accuracy to be the confrontation of your ability to hit against your opponent’s ability to block. Therefore, your attack style determines what attack bonuses you’re using from your weapon and what defense bonuses your opponent’s armor is defending from (for example, slash versus slash, crush versus crush, etc). Beyond that, your actual attack level versus their defense level has a greater impact.</p>
<p>I have always wanted to do a combat system where attack determines both the ability to hit and the ability to hit high. Though I discussed this with a friend for many hours, we could never come up with a system that acted like RS. I would venture to guess that attack is specifically for an ability to hit and strength is the ability to hit greater maximums. Do it whichever way you please. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>your formula is wrong</p>
<p>it’s supposed to be:</p>
<p>20, 10, 5, 5</p>
<p>First hit is your max or whatever,<br>
second is the first hit divided by 2<br>
last 2 should add up to equal the second hit</p>
<p>another example is: 33, 17, 8, 9</p>
<p>using the real formula, aslong as you can’t hit over 30ish with the first hit, it should be pretty solid.</p>
