    <description>Can we trust the majority? Should we let ochlocracy and mob rule dictate everyone? Should individual ideas be weighed as less valuable than those of the minority?</description>

</aside>
<p>owning a house does not mean you deserve it, I can inherit a house and be a social burden, but using your logic I would be allowed to vote when someone on government housing who is a public worker/public figure/whatever wouldn’t be able to vote, you’ll have to keep moving the posts until you end up with an idealistic future world where everyone has EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES, meaning no support from rich families, no inheritance, all that matters is you are good public figure</p>
<p>I’d say neutral opportunities is an easier goal to achieve</p>
<p>ps I’m not sure how government housing works in the good ol us of a, but over the pond it certainly isn’t free and isn’t a “hand out”, it’s cheaper than renting private housing but then it isn’t as good, oh and you can actually buy the house, that doesn’t directly help the public like buying a private house would, so if the requirement for voting is owning a house, what good will that do? what about renting private housing/apartments/whatever? how is it different from renting a government property?</p>

              <p>All political systems are as good as it’s weakest links. Which is why, from a Communist point of view, it’s good to get rid of people not cooperating. Same applies to a democracy, although the politicians don’t have enough power to get rid of their enemies. In an ideal world, I’d prefer Anarchy. But Anarchy depends heavily on the people, and as soon as someone starts to abuse the system it will degrade.</p>
<p>Democracy isn’t fair, as 51% rules over 49%. I see it in the Netherlands. Our current right wing government has 76 seats, out of 150. That’s one more than the mostly left opposition has. This results in politicians lying even more than before. A few months after the parliamentary elections, we elected the senate. In those few months, our government came up with a lot of rubbish plans to get a lot of votes. For instance, they started testing whether our maximum speed should be increased from 120km/h to 130km/h. After the elections for the senate, they came to the conclusion that it’s a bad idea. And they also decided to cut the budget…</p>

Good idea, but should the state follow town ideals, or are they unrelated? What if a town doesn’t like a state law?</p>

<p>It may be a good political idea, <span class="bbcode-b">but it isn’t being carried out like it should be</span>. I’m still young and I have yet to establish myself in political ideas, but that is my take on things based on what I’ve read and heard through media (probably censored or tampered news).[/quote]</p>
<p>Of course, the US system is a great example.<br>
Theres only two possible parties, when one party looses the elections they know they will be back in government within at least 8 years.<br>
The voting system is called First Past The Post and there are many many problems with it</p>

<p>I agree that education doesn’t imply intelligence. Before taking a good look at <a href="http://MITB.com" rel="nofollow noopener">MITB.com</a>, I had stereotyped those in the drug thread as idiots who had no brains; however, after reading several well-thought posts by said people, I changed my mind. It’s examples like these which prove that sometimes common sense is greater than education. With those being elected, they are money bag figureheads who over-educate themselves leading them to thinking their views are always ultimately correct, so long as the next overly-educated moron agrees.</p>
<p>As far as it being fair; No - Like I said earlier, the government is too much of a figurehead system to care about what the public actually need.</p>
<p>I say that so long as the government cannot be trusted (completely) by the people who established it, that pure democracy is out of the question.</p>
