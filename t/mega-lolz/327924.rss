    <description>Today me and my friend went to a basketball game. Our seats were far away from each other so we just sat somewhere near our friends seats. About 10 minutes into the game, the family who really had our seats came to where we were sitting and were confused. After my dad explains the scenario, offering the family to sit one row down, the father of the family tells us off to our seats furiously. So we just move one row down, where we offered him to sit. Then, at halftime when they were choosing the winner for some prizes, we realize that our row won. After they hand us the prizes (various shit) the father screams &quot;WHAT THE FUCK!&quot; and get&#39;s his family kicked out. 

Moral of this story: Doing the wrong this isnt always wrong :)</description>
