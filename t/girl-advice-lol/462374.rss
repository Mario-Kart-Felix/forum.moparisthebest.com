    <title>Girl advice (lol)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/girl-advice-lol/462374</link>
    <description>Well, there&#39;s this girl I&#39;ve known since the 9th grade. (I&#39;m currently in 10th) We talk pretty much every day, but there&#39;s this feeling that won&#39;t quit bothering me (no, it&#39;s not sexual urges, Jesus) I really like her, I just don&#39;t know how to tell her. I think she&#39;s perfect, I love her personality, looks, everything. When I hug her, I just get this feeling of &quot;I wanna be with you&quot;. But there&#39;s a catch, she has a boyfriend. I think that if I told her, it would make everything awkward and we would lose the friendship we have right now. If that did happen, I don&#39;t know what i&#39;d do.... she makes my day.

Yes, i&#39;m [b]desperate[/b], so I am asking this on MoparScape. I would like everyone to be serious, and not talk about fucking and shit like that, lul.

Any advice?

<p>humour is subjective, just because you do not like rape jokes, or you do not find rape jokes funny doesn’t mean other people should also dislike rape jokes or that other people shouldn’t find rape jokes funny</p>
<p>I’m going to go ahead and assume you don’t like rape jokes because you find them offensive, being offended by something is also subjective and people can be offended at damn near anything, if you police rape jokes because you find them offensive you may as well police every joke because someone will find it offensive</p>

Its just the way I was brought up.<br>
But in our current society I’d probably say its a mix of kindness and greediness to get the girl.</p>

<p>Fuck it, every man for themselves when it comes to women. It’s not your girlfriend, fuck what he thinks. If the time comes when she’s your girlfriend, make sure you make it so good for her that she doesn’t jump at the next chance she gets to move on from you.

<p>You’d be surprised how lit that you play online games. Now, that’s not too say it’s not a turn off - it is. But, I think everyone can agree with me here; confidence is the key to getting anywhere with anything, especially women. The difficult part is finding the line between cockyness and confidence.</p>
<p>Now, if you show you’re embarrassed about playing Runescape or RSPS, you won’t project confidence. If you openly admit too it, appear as if you don’t give a fuck about RSPS, you project confidence. However, if you claim you’re better than someone, you’ll project cockyness and she will think you’re a bigheaded waste of time. This also stems from the fact, if you enjoy RSPS; you enjoy RSPS. That’s all there is too it, who gives a fuck what she/other people think about your hobbies?[/quote]</p>
<p>My point exactly. I mean, I don’t sit on my laptop or stuff while my girlfriend is here or anything but she knows I make websites in my spare time. I don’t tend to play RSPS anymore but she wouldn’t mind if I did. The only time she’s ever seen me on my laptop is if she falls asleep and I get bored so I come on this/the irc.</p>
