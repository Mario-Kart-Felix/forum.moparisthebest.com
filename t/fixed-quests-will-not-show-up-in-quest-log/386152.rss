    <title>[FIXED] Quests will not show up in quest log?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fixed-quests-will-not-show-up-in-quest-log/386152</link>
    <description>EDIT: The problem has been fixed.  I found lines in texthandler.java that sent blank text.  The code was AFTER the oines sending the text so it overruled those lines and the log came up blank.  If anyone has trouble with something like this, check the place your quests are being sent and Delete/populate any blank lines.


Hello,
I&#39;ve been fiddling around in my server trying to add some quests, and I noticed something weird.  Whenever I look at the quest log, it shows some quests but not others.  For example, it won&#39;t show black knight&#39;s fortress, but will show cook&#39;s assistant.

I was wondering if this could be a client-based error or if it&#39;s something in the server that could be preventing it.
I&#39;m using a BlindScape Based server, and I have not changed anything in terms of quests.  
The first quest on the list is lost city, which does not show up.  The first quest on the list that Does show up is about the fifth one down.

In my texthandler.java, I have this:
[code]if(c.q1 == 0){
c.sendQuest(&quot;@red@Lost City&quot;, 7332);
}
if(c.q1 &gt; 0){
c.sendQuest(&quot;@yel@Lost City&quot;, 7332);
}
if(c.q1 == 15){
c.sendQuest(&quot;@gre@Lost City&quot;, 7332);
}[/code]
Note that this is the same code for ALL the quests in the file, but only about half of them are being displayed in my client.  Upon login, the quests show for a BRIEF amount of time, about a fraction of a second, but then they disappear.  Clicking on the blank spaces will still bring up the quest menu.
I looked around in the other .java files but cant seem to find anything relating to how they&#39;re displayed.  If I missed something, someone please tell me.

Again, I just want to know what&#39;s causing the problem, and if it can be fixed.</description>

              <p>yeah ive seen that thread before, and I double checked all those locations to make sure everything was correct.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
I’ve used multiple clients by now, and there’s no difference, so I’ve narrowed it down to a source problem.</p>
<p>Also, I have tried moving one of the not-appearing names to a different line in the quest log.  This does not make a difference either, the name stays blank.</p>

This is one of the working ones, I can see it all the time on my list, so it leads me to believe that its not the texthandler, because the codes are basically the same.</p>
