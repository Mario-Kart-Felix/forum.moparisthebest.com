I would like to present to you, InspireRSPS. InspireRSPS started out as a project that a friend and I wanted to do a little work to a source, and release it to the world-wide web. So we stayed up for a couple of hours with a base, and decided to do some research, and add a few codes in here and there. You know some touch up work, and it still needs some more work done to it, and we&#39;re getting there. xD

This is a SPAWN Server: This means that you can spawn almost every item, although there are a few that will be for rewards which will be received from Donating to our server.

Some Updates that were recently added were: Some commands for Donators, and regular members, and fully working Castle Wars, and successfully added The Crucible feature.

Bosses/Minigames: Jad/Fight Pits/Kiln/Dominion Tower Bosses/KBD/QBD/Nomad/Duel Arena

Our combat system deep inside the files of InspireRSPS is outstanding, and is most definitely one of the best qualities of the server.</description>

              <p>gl and above members have a point if your gonna make donator ranks dont add everything thats f2p for donators  :palm: you need to add items such as certain customs, Donator capes, ect.</p>
<p>And I hate your forums just throwing that out there. You made it way too flashy.</p>
<p>Stick with simple SMF, or mybb or even IPB or vbulletin themes.</p>
