    <title>Dragon Claws Special Attack</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dragon-claws-special-attack/519137</link>
    <description>Ok so I have Dragon Claws added on my server and client, and I can&#39;t get the Special Attack to work. Can someone please help me with this? And I also want to make it so that when I wield D claws it takes off the shield, so it doesnt have a shield and claws on.
