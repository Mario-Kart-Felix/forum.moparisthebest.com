    <title>RS2 Advertisements: Rules and Guidelines</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rs2-advertisements-rules-and-guidelines/521514</link>
    <description>This board is the place where you may post advertisements for your RuneScape private servers. Please make sure that you follow the below rules and guidelines so we can keep this board as clean as possible. If you see someone breaking the rules, please report it as soon as possible. Simply posting in the advertisement thread will not notify a moderator as quick as a report will.
 
[u]Guidelines/Ideals[/u]:

[ul][li]Although providing some sort of media is not required, it will make your advertisement more appealing, and ultimately draw more players to your server.[/li]
[li]If someone decides to host a server that has previously been released in the downloads section, it is not your job to point it out and make a fool of the poster. Everyone has their own tastes, and if they like what they&#39;ve found then let them have their fun.[/li]
[li]Criticism/server reviews are one of the first things potential players look out for when trying to find a server to play. If you see someone negatively criticizing your game, they are allowed to do so. The only time someone will be penalized is if they attempt to start an argument.[/li]
[li]Simply because a poster has a low post count does not mean that they don&#39;t have a quality server to offer. Don&#39;t judge a book by its cover.[/li][/ul]

[u]Rules:[/u]

[ul][li]You may create an advertisement for a server you do not own, if you&#39;ve been given the permission of the owner. If you create an advertisement and you&#39;ve no permission the post can be removed, usually at the request of the server owner.[/li]

[li]You may have only [b]ONE[/b] advertisement per server. This means that even if you posted the last one a year ago, you must still use the original. If you have changed the contents of your advertisement thread, you must still use that original advertisement. If you post multiple advertisements, and continue to do so after a moderator&#39;s warning, you will be banned from posting in this section.[/li]

[li]You are not allowed to artificially bump your topic. This applies to removing and reposting a comment OR creating multiple accounts to bump your topic.[/li]

[li]All advertisements in this section are for RS2 private servers. If you wish to advertise your RuneScape Classic server, please do so [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,119.0.html]here[/url].[/li]

[li]You may advertise links without approval within in this board only. If you wish to reference your website anywhere else on this website (including your signature), please message a staff member to receive approval beforehand.[/li]

[li]Failure to provide links within 24 hours of moderator warning will result in a thread lock until the original poster notifies the moderator and wishes to reopen the thread with links. This rule is in place to ensure that posters are here to accept criticism from other members, and that they are willing to be actual members of the site.[/li]

[li]Selling of any sort of product/service is by no means permitted on this website. All sorts of sales are to be handles outside of this website. We are not responsible for anything exchanged outside of this site.[/li]

[li]If any malicious activity (be it viruses, keyloggers, RATs, etc) is found to be related to your server in any way, your server will be banned from this website permanently.[/li]

[li]Respect other people&#39;s feelings when posting. If you find the need to post nonconstructive or otherwise disrespectful comments in someone&#39;s thread, then it will be removed. If you are found to constantly post disrespectful, rude, or nonconstructive on people&#39;s advertisements, you will be given an infraction. Continued infringement of this rule will ultimately result in a ban from posting in this section.[/li]

[li]If you are found to be constantly starting arguments, continuously getting others to bump your topic, or getting friends to post more advertisements, all related topics/advertisements will be locked and you will not be permitted to create a new one.[/li]

[li]By no means is any person permitted to remove their reply in a thread and repost it in order to bring the advertisement back to the first spot in the board. The reply will be removed each time by a moderator, and continued thread-bumping in such a manner will result in an infraction.[/li]

[li]You may not provide links to your donation page through this website. We do not want to be responsible for any transactions that occur through your game. Feel free to provide donation links on your website, though.
[list]
[li]Exceptions to this rule:[/li]
[list]
[li]You may say that your server accepts donations.[/li]
[li]You may say that your server has an automated donating system.[/li]
[li]You may explain what your server puts all donations towards.[/li]
[/list][/li]
[/list]
Understand that this site&#39;s [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,342270.0.html]Global Rules[/url] are also in effect here, along with every other board on this site. Failure to comply with these rules will result in action taken against your account. If you have any questions/concerns, please either post them in this topic or message a staff member.[/ul]</description>

</aside>
<p>Condescending “constructive criticism” is not allowed under my watch.[/quote]That doesn’t even make sense to me JC I’m sorry.</p>
<p>If somebody with more java knowledge goes on a server advertisement and says: </p><blockquote>"Hey look, been in the scene far more years than you. I see you are using blah blah source. here are the issues with it, this is what you need to fix. "</blockquote><br>
That isn’t a bad thing. That is somebody who is personally either witnessing via media or experience who is trying to help the other person. AKA that topic you got all upset about. The guy had graphical bugs in the media. So we were being “superior” as you are calling it by trying to tell him <blockquote>"look man, we are former owners of a server also, appearance is everything! You need to get rid of those graphical bugs as they turn people away. "</blockquote>
<p>That was us not being superior that was us being helpful.</p>
<p>If we can’t give CC from looking at the media then what is the point of even posting in the section? You might as well make it so only OP’s can post the topic and replies are locked. The rules state that we can’t start an argument. We never “started” the argument. It was the OP who wanted to say it wasn’t a bug when it obviously is if we can view the media and point it out.</p>
<p>I will also be making a suggestion about this momentarily cause I do think the staff needs to review the rules of this board again now.</p>

              <p>You can post anything about the server, any aspect whether it be staff or the teleports but you must do so in a constructive manner, so don’t post “your staff are shit, your teleports are shit bad server idiot”, instead post “Your teleports need some work, I would suggest X. You should probably look into your staff team as well I had a few negative experiences with them (Perhaps I can PM you more detail, or post here if you’re interested?) overall the server needs some work”.</p>
<p>The above are two trivial examples, but it shows the line between blatantly non-constructive and rude and then constructive and friendly. There is a whole ploy of things to consider, while constructive posts are good and posts that give reason like the example above they should only be constructive to an extent, if the topic turns into a full on war about that is serving no purpose other than repetition and ego then it will be closed down and acted on. To be clear again, if there were two parties who were posting “it is” and “it isn’t” but reworded in everyone of their posts in the argument then that would be considered a pointless and unwinnable squabble. Leaving your “issues” on the topic as a constructive post is fine, but trying to hammer it into them in a burst of rage isn’t which spans for 7 pages and achieves nothing isn’t.</p>
<p>My own personal view of this section is this: people should treat their posts like a review, they have one shot and they can edit it in the future. They include all the information they’ve experienced in there, in a constructive and formatted manner. This way when somebody comes along they don’t see 7 pages of arguments about some moderator called “xx pker49584 scape 1234 x”, but rather a page full of eloquently put posts which consistently mention the moderator, and don’t overshadow the other issues/positives of said server.</p>

This is considered as semi-constructive, and I would end up editing the post to something more mature if I were to come across it. Perhaps [i]'Tried the server out, it wasn't that good, I don't like the staff and there were no players online.'[/i]

This is acceptable as long as I don't see you constantly posting this sort of comment. I aim for more constructive posts in this section.

              <p>I thought it would be obvious enough why we don’t condone the sales of staff positions. The main reason being that we are aiming to advertise legimate servers and by the sales of staff spots it is endangering the legitimacy and professionalism of the server. We don’t want to be a part of that. By us allowing them to advertise on our forums it will be indirectly allowing them to conduct the sales of positions, which would ultimately be going against the rule stating that sales/advertising donations are not permitted within these forums.</p>
