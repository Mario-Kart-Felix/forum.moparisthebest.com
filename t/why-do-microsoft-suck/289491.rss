    <title>Why do Microsoft Suck?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-do-microsoft-suck/289491</link>
    <description>T4_, ownagesbot and I were just discussing the matter.

I personally think that one of the main reasons Microsoft fail so much is that they are about 5 years behind schedule on all OS Development. They first released the NT Kernel around 1993-1994 but was only aimed at High-end computing and Workstations. Unfortunatly, for the Consumer market they continued to release DOS Based OS&#39;s (Which were truly terrible; *cough*Windows [b]M[/b]istake [b]E[/b]dition*cough*). If they focused all their attention to NT, it would be years ahead, or even give Microsoft to develop a new Kernel.

Secondly, it is vulnerable to viruses because about 90% of all home computers have a Windows OS installed. This means everyone, including skiddes, get the opportunity to try and cause damage to your computer. You have to admit that if everyone used Linux, it would be plagued by a lot more threats (obviously not as many as Windows, but still more).

Finally, the most obvious reason is that they just want profit.

Please share thoughts.</description>

              <p>The fact they can get away with ripping everyone off comes to mind. Another reason why microsoft suck, but not a reason why i dislike them is because they don’t create their own tech, they just buy it out.</p>
<p>Latest example, Project Natal for the Xbox 360. 3DV systems shows off all new 3D camera and motion tracking technology at CES 2008, microsoft swiftly buy out their business and the rights to their product, a year later - E3 2009, that same camera, in a different case shows up claiming to be 100% internally developed by microsoft, with them initially saying that them buying 3DV systems was irrelevant to the development of Natal. They finally admitted that it was the same camera that they aquired with 3DV systems.</p>
<p>Like i said though, that is one reason why i think they <span class="bbcode-b">suck</span>, i don’t dislike them for that. Nothing wrong at all with buying your way to the top if you can, business is business.</p>

<p>I don’t like Microsoft, the only thing i like about them is there slow moving will to create new technology and slowly turning things wireless by the day. But i do like Windows the product, as i know many of you do, your just pissed off that it’s not free?</p>
<p>Most of you here, should i assume be advanced OS users, therefore you would never go and get your self a virus like that, and IF you happen to, you could remove it easily. I myself am a windows user and have been for the last 10 years, for the last 5 years of my life i have never touched a virus scanner or anything like that. I also have been infected about maybe twice from my own stupidity, and fixed that up very easily.</p>
<p>Now if you can do that which i know most of you here can, why do you guys give a shit about security? Who cares about everyone else, surely you guys don’t give a shit that other people not as bright as us can get infected a lot easier, it helps the economy in a way. You buy a car, and are going to need to get it serviced/fixed somewhat often, why not the same with a computer until you can figure it out your self?</p>
<p>I know windows has the worst security, comes with a bunch of shit too, but as advanced users as we all are, we should only be worrying about ourselves and how it treats us, and so far windows has given me an extraordinary experienced compared to linux. Be grateful for what’s in front of you, imagine how far behind computer technology, even gaming would be right now if it wasn’t for Windows. We would be 10 years back IMO.</p>

<p>The second is the security and permissions systems that linux runs on, and that windows has almost an entire lack of.  Windows users, by default, have full uninhibited access to the entire computer, one user (or a virus) can easily destroy the entire computer and require a full reformat and reinstall.  Linux users, virtually without exception, run as a user with every needed permission to use the computer, but not with the unnecessary and dangerous permissions required to cripple the entire system.  The worst a virus could ever do on a linux system would be to delete that particular user’s home directory, and to fix it all you would have to do is log in as a different user.  Windows will never improve this either, because if they were to do so, it would break backwards compatibility with practically all older applications.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if that’s the exact reason, I’d say it’s because cars have a long lifetime. Sure you have new drivers, but they usually buy old used cars. Where’s the money in that? They’re selling to repeat buyers, and when people are shopping for a new car after 8 or 9 years, they want something innovative. Then there are the people that need the new generation every year. They’re after the latest and greatest, and can’t have the same car as their neighbor.</p>
<p>Of course corporate competition plays into that, but it’s mainly keeping sales up from one quarter to the next.</p>
