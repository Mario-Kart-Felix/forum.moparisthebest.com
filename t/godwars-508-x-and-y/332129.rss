    <description>Title says it, i never got into the 508 servers, i stayed in the 317 and updated. Lately i have started the project on re-writing a 508 base into a Wl setup. I am about to work on godwars, since i have the NPC&#39;s fully done. 1 Dilemma, i need the cords. Anybody have a list of 508 coords or location of god-wars?</description>
