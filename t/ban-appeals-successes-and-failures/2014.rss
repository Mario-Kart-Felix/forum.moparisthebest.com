    <title>Ban Appeals : Successes and Failures</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ban-appeals-successes-and-failures/2014</link>
    <description>I was hoping we could compile a list of whch ban appeals Jagex accepts and which ones are denied to help out our fellow autoers. 
For a failed response, please write the whole appeal down so we can mabey work off it. For a accepted appeal, just give us the general idea, mabey some of the finer points. I know if you paste it here noobs will copy and paste it it. Thank you, i&#39;ll start

FAILED: &quot;I was banned for macroing, i dont even know what macroing is. I&amp;#039;ve read the rules, i think cheating is a terrible thing and should never be done ever, I HATE people who try to cheat. I dont know how i was marked as cheating, but i never have and never will. I hope you will see this error, I Love my runescape account...&quot; 

-their response- We are 100% confident in our macro detection systems, and in the highly trained staff who monitor and take action based on the results presented by these systems, and as such are 100% confident that you have been using such a program. This is a clear violation of the Rules of Conduct and as such your account has been placed on a permanent ban.

I&#39;m hoping you guys will add to this, failed or accepted. If you used the same general idea and failed/passed please post also, seeing if one works 50% or 75% or something would be handy also</description>

              <p>i've never had one successful ban appeal and i've had over 30 accs banned spanning a period of 10 months. Back when scar was the preferred method of autoing and aryan had small number of users. I've tried all types of appeals and i dont think u can successfully appeal a ban if u were autoing with aryan. If u admit u were autoing or doing anything illegal, they wont lift the ban. If u deny it, they'll say they are 100% sure u were autoing. So either way you are screwed.</p>

I have recieved a message that says i have auto'ed. I don't know what you are talking about, and i have no idea how i have to auto! I hate autoers! [i](ofcourse not, i AM one :D)[/i]

<br>

This is just so unfair. I have spend months of work in this account, enjoyed runescape in many ways, and now it's just GONE! Completely unfair! I'm crying while i'm writing this [i](In fact i was laughing ;) :P) because i didn't auto!

<p>Please Jagex, check that i didn't auto and please unban me!<br>Sincerly,<br>***</p>

<p>Well, after taking a LONG break away from RuneScape I had started getting more active and more matture. I have learned that macroing is just something wrong and it just ruins the game for other people and spoils it for me. I sincerely regret macroing and I hope that you give my account back. I know that cheating is wrong and I promise with my heart and soul that I will NEVER cheat again.</p>

<p>Dear *********,</p>

<p>Thank you for your ban appeal.</p>

<p>We regret to inform you that this account has been banned because of Macroing.</p>

<p>Please refer to article number 7 in the Rules of Conduct:</p>

<p>Rule 7: You must not attempt to use other programs (e.g. bots, macros or autominers) in conjunction with our games to give yourself an unfair advantage at the game. You also may not circumvent any of our mechanisms designed to log out inactive users automatically.</p>

<p>We do not discuss our detection process with anyone, to do such would give auto/macro users information to help them avoid detection. For all the details on our macro detection that we are willing to give out please read the Macro FAQ, which can be found by selecting the link titled 'Get the answer to a question' under the 'Information and Advice' section (left) on the main page of our website (www.runescape.com).</p>

<p>We are 100% confident in our macro detection systems, and in the highly trained staff who monitor and take action based on the results presented by these systems, and as such are 100% confident that you have been using such a program. In normal circumstances this would result in the permanent removal of your account for the game, however upon reviewing your history we have decided to place you on a temporary 7 day ban instead.</p>

<p>Please be aware that we will be monitoring the activities of your account closely and that any further breaches of the Rules of Conduct will result in your account being permanently removed from the game. </p>

<p>The usage of these programs ruins the game for honest players and is not how the game has been designed to be played. We will not tolerate a minority of players using these programs to achieve by computer what fair players have accomplished through honest hard work and game play.</p>

<p>We strongly suggest that you take the time to make yourself familiar with our Rules of Conduct, which can be found in the 'Information and Advice' section of <a href="http://www.runescape.com" rel="nofollow">www.runescape.com</a>, before returning to play.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>RuneScape Customer Support</p>

<hr>

<p>On <em>* April 200</em> you sent us the following:</p>

It would be great it i got my name back i really want to play and im not a bad person ty</p>

<hr>

<p>Of course it works, Jagex are money-hungry bastards, if someone kills themselves becuase they screwed up and banned them and got a law suite from the family saying it was there fault and they lost buttloads of cash.. then what'd happen. Think about it.</p>

<p>They would really have to unban you if you said you were contemplating suicide because of their game.</p>

<p>Admitting you did it will get you a 3-7 day ban and 3 black marks, you will get your account back though.</p>

<p>If you give the slightest hint trying to say they screwed up or that you didnt do it then they will ban you.</p>

<p>Jagex will not admit mistakes.</p>

<p>-(sigh) I was macroing, yes. I thought it would be a good way to play runescape, but now i see i was wrong. I thought I would have more fun this way, but now i see i didnt. I ruined the game for myself and for other players, and i wasnt having fun. Cheating isnt fun, and i can clearly see that now. I PROMISE I will never Auto again, I want to play runescape the right way from now on. Thank you-</p>

<p>whats disturbing is the modified client part, i got banned for macroing and denied appeal for modified client...</p>

<p>edit * I just checked my other ban appeal for my mule, same story. banned for macroing denied appeal for modified client...</p>
