<p>He made me post it, so i dont know the story. I'd give you a bunch of good 3d models, but on the author's request I am not handing them out to anyone. When the pro version comes out, I'll be most likely ripping a few things. I am excited for it. </p>

<blockquote>OOOOOOOOOOOO another MMORPG!!! What language is it in?</blockquote>

<p>The realmcrafter engine was written in blitz3d as well, and is based off ckob's engine, and it just so happens Afelhem is also based off his engine as well, it's opensource and free now, can't remember where to get it though. Btw, solemn you should scale down the dirt texture a bit, it looks kinda blurry.</p>

<p>Yeah the content that it comes with is amazing, if you purchased it all it would cost a lot. It's too bad their 3d models(most of them) are encrypted. I would have liked to use them on other things. </p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
