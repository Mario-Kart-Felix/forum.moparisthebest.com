    <description>ok unlike most of the posts asking for advice on sources that they will never download, or setting up a development team that wont get anywhere. i actually need help. i have look everywhere on this site. they deleted all of the anti nulls. other than the new p16 one that doesnt help. this is the second time ive posted asking for this and i was ignored. does anyone wanna help me or will i be ignored again...sorry for rudeness but im getting irritated. i add my server to status page and as soon as a ilog on. the first person on is someone using syi. ok i restart the server after it freezes my client. i log back on and the first person to log in again is a new person using syi...but a diff name. i need to stop these ppl or im screwed.</description>
