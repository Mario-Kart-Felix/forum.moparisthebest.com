    <title>[317 Delta] New donator class questions, will rep</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-delta-new-donator-class-questions-will-rep/385599</link>
    <description>So I added my regular donator etc, my client had the object already built in apparently.

Now, I recently made a model for a new donor class, and I coded the new class in, now I have a couple questions:

1) How can I make it so that it now loads my new symbol? Would it be client-sided or server sided? 
2) Once add the symbol to my sprites folder, do I need to do anything server-sided from there?

Also, if you could.
How would I assign a new crown to a new player rights (Player rights = 4 or something). The symbol was already made, and is already added to my sprites folder

Thank you!</description>
