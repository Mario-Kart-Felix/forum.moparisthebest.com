Instructions:

Start with all players at the Varrock rune shop.
Make sure they have cash on them i recommend 100-300k.
I recommend you have about 6 or more players as you will maximize profits.
Remember to Delclare your Players.

Have fun and remember the 7 Golden rules of SRL autoing.}</description>
