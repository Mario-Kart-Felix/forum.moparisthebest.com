    <title>Not really server help... But it&#39;s for the server I guess</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/not-really-server-help-but-its-for-the-server-i-guess/435160</link>
    <description>Alright, i&#39;m trying to set up a template. More specific, a a runescape 2007, template, when runescape was actually cool and un-laggy.

I downloaded this one php one, and it just doesn&#39;t want to work. So if you could help me and you&#39;re good with PHP please let me know. (: Because I need all the help I can on creating this so that I have something that looks beast. The old site I used to play, has it, but i&#39;m having trouble getting the MYSQL to work on 000webhost.com. 

So if you can help, please do send me a message.
