    <title>No one can connect to my server- Using vps[508]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/no-one-can-connect-to-my-server-using-vps-508/403591</link>
    <description>Well, me and a friend recently purchased a VPS to host a server.
I&#39;ve set everything up, and I can connect to the server via the VPS.
(Server and client are seperate)
However, when he and I attempt to connect to the server from our computers, we get stuck at connecting to update server, even when the server is online.
The IP is set in the client that we&#39;re using, and I&#39;m rather confused as to why I can&#39;t connect. Any help would be appreciated.
Also; If someone talented in 508 coding could assist us with our server, that would be great. :)
I hold no facade of being a coder; but I&#39;m not an idiot, and thus far I&#39;ve mainly been coding off of trial and error. (And the almighty power of the google.)
Thanks in advance.</description>

              <p>Yeah, I fixed it. Now the issue is finding a non-shitty source. We found a nice one, but for some reason after logging in the client crashed and gives me an hs_err_pid thing.</p>

<li>Nevermind, douchebag customer service guy lied, 43594 is not open, attempting to open it now via iptables. (What he says we have to use?)<br>
After trolling the customer service rep for a short amount of time, we convinced him to open the ports for us.</li>
