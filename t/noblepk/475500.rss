About a year ago I ran the 317 RSPS NoblePK. We ran into difficulty and had to shut it down.

We are back with a 718!

This server is Eco Based, built from PKing up.

[U]Features:[/U]

All bosses active - (QBD, Kiln, Nex etc, etc.)
All Skills working
Squeal of Fortune (You earn spins with every 2 hour playtime, this is accumulative)
PERFECT switching
Want Bandos etc. in shops? Tough. You won&#39;t find them here. We have a custom shop area with everything a player would need!
Dominion Tower
Active dicing/flower game groups
Active clans, with Castlewars + Clan wars
Many many more!


We have ensured that all players, whether you are PvP or PvM, that you receive the BEST server experience with our friendly owners and staff that take in every suggestion made!
