    <title>3 small issues I cannot find</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/3-small-issues-i-cannot-find/428289</link>
    <description>I really hope this is the right place for these questions. If not, please point me in the right direction :)

1-I cannot find where the framework for the game is. Usually the images are found within the cache in the interface folders, etc. This one that I have has no images for the frame. I cannot figure out where it would be that I would change these to either the correct RS frames, or my own. Does anyone know where this would be found? These are definitely custom made.

2-I have never seen this interface appear when starting a game, until I got this client/server. where is this located, and how do I remove it? (image below)

This is the first full throttle game I am coding on my own. Though things are surprisingly easier than I thought, these two things have not been. I would not even mind being able to get it to NOT shut down after 2 minutes idle, but I can most likely find that :)</description>
