    <description>I am new to this type of development however I did manage to set the server up by using 718 Matrix source and 718 Client. The game server runs perfectly on VPS however when my friends try to get on it the client doesn&#39;t load and it shows a jss5 or whatever error. I have checked the ports and double checked that server and client are using the same path. Can anyone please, please please help me out to get this sorted !!!!!!!!!!!! :| :palm: :palm: I DONT MIND PAYING TO SOMEONE WHO WILL BE ABLE TO FIX THIS</description>
