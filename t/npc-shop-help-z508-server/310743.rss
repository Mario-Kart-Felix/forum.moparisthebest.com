    <title>NPC shop help [Z508 Server]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-shop-help-z508-server/310743</link>
    <description>Hi all.

We have recently downloaded a Z508 base and found that it is missing shops all together.

We have found another working Z508 base and taken the NPC&#39;s, and various shop files to make shops work due to our first base having working pvp.

However, NPC&#39;s spawn, and have the trade options, but no shop screen/box comes up to buy stuff from when you click them.
They also have no talk function. We have looked everywhere now.

Can anyone advise any help on this? It is the final step to completing our server.
Any help appreciated. Thanks in advance.</description>
