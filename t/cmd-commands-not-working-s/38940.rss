    <title>CMD Commands, not working? :S</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cmd-commands-not-working-s/38940</link>
    <description>Hello.

I was about to do some fun with my commandprompt, but found out that it wasnt working!
It says things like &quot;this is not an internal or external commando, nor a program or program file&quot;.
But I mean, I&#39;m using normal stuff like &quot;telnet&quot;, &quot;ipconfig&quot; and so on.
Why? :S
I installed JDK yesterday, can it have something to do with it?
I have no idea but really wants to use my Commando thing.
Anyone know why this is happening?

Thanks in advance..</description>
