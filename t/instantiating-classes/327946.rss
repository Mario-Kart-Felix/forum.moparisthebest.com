    <title>Instantiating classes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/instantiating-classes/327946</link>
    <description>I know how to instantiate a class in the regular ways 
(SomeHandler handler = new SomeHandler();)
like that

But i have seen a few people instantiate new classes from within a method like

doSomething(new SomeHandler())
I was wondering how that would work? I tried searching for a tut but could only find the regular instantiation and nested classes.
Say for an int it would be doSomething(int (name)). Would i have to do doSomething(Object (name)) to instantiate the class?

Please, i kind of want to learn this, would make a project im working on loads easier.</description>
