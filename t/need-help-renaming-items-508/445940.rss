    <title>Need help renaming items! 508</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-renaming-items-508/445940</link>
    <description>I am trying to rename my items in my 508 server. I tried everything, I used 3 or 4 different tuts and different snippets.. The name of the item I wanted changed never changed.. I&#39;m pretty sure that its supposed to be in applet_sub1, and I found where &quot;Dragon Platebody&quot; was and put the code below it.. Still didn&#39;t work. Please help.</description>
