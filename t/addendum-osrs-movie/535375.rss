Ok I found this piece of gold.
I love rs fan movies (Like world 901) and this didn&#39;t disappoint me either.
It was worth to watch, even though there was soem parts where I was just like &#39;&#39;Cmon! Do something!&#39;&#39; and that&#39;s how I broke my screen.. 

I&#39;ll rate it 7/10 even though idea is great and twist at the end is awesome. Also famous players acting there;)... 
BUT
Mouse clicking by the guy who was currently filming was annoying as Spongebob&#39;s laugh while diarrhea after heavy drinking..
