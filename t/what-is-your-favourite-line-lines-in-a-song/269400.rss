    <description>Title says all.

Mine are lyrics from &#39;Your Guardian Angel&#39; by The Redjumpsuit apparatus:

&quot;I will never let you fall, I&#39;ll stand up woth you forever. I&#39;ll be there with you through it all, even if saving you sends me to heaven&quot;</description>

              <p>[code]Tuesday morning now<br>
I gotta have somewhere to go<br>
I call up tommy now<br>
I call him on the telephone<br>
Won’t you wake up and come with me now<br>
I’m going to the pawn and loan<br>
Walking down thirty three<br>
Walking down thirty oh</p>
<p>Well what am i supposed to think<br>
I drop a nickel in the sink<br>
I love people like a brother now<br>
But i’m not gonna be their mother now<br>
What if someone walked up to me<br>
And like an apple cut right through me<br>
I’m not just gonna stand there grinning<br>
I’m not the one who’s sinin’<br>
Screwdriver</p>
<p>Now that you have heard my story now<br>
I’ve got a little ending to it now<br>
Whenever you go out alone<br>
Take a little dog a bone<br>
Think about your little sister<br>
Then you got to drive it home<br>
Screwdriver [/code]<br>

Song:Blood Is The Price Of Glory</p>
<p>[Code]Before the grimmest enemy<br>
Cold rain whipping those proud faces<br>
Warcries raising their spirits<br>
Despising death as they rush forward<br>
Blood of the brothers drains to the ground<br>
Stirring up rage, giving the power<br>
Trampling the enemy with their feet<br>
Without fear they fight</p>
<p>Can you hear the call of the North star<br>
Feel its longing in your heart<br>
This bound is eternal<br>
Sworn through blood<br>
At the end we will stand as one!<br>
Even if the daylight dies<br>
Our horde marches on and on<br>
If we should fall down to the ground<br>
We’ll rise again and never give up!</p>
<p>But for some it’s all too much<br>
This honorable battle and bloodshed<br>
They flee like a swarm of craven rats<br>
Leaving their brothers to a certain death<br>
The last furious men<br>
They didn’t fear death or pain<br>
They held up their swords and shields<br>
As winners they stood on the battlefield</p>
<p>Can you hear the call of the North star<br>
Feel its longing in your heart<br>
This bound is eternal<br>
Sworn through blood<br>
At the end we will stand as one!<br>
Even if the daylight dies<br>
Our horde marches on and on<br>
If we should fall down to the ground<br>
We’ll rise again and never give up!</p>
<p>Run away you cowards<br>
We turn our backs on you<br>
The shame that now stains your name<br>
Will only brighten our glory<br>
Those who fight till their last breath<br>
And fall with honour<br>
Their names and deeds shall live forever<br>
Never to be forgotten</p>
<p>No axe stayed in your weak hand<br>
No shield protected you from the blows of enemies<br>
Get out of our sight<br>
The war has no need for traitors</p>
<p>Can you hear the call of the North star<br>
Feel its longing in your heart<br>
This bound is eternal<br>
Sworn through blood<br>
At the end we will stand as one!<br>
Even if the daylight dies<br>
Our horde marches on and on<br>
If we should fall down to the ground<br>
We’ll rise again and never give up!<br>

<p>Song: Victory Song</p>
<p>[code]The plan of invasion<br>
an Evil deception<br>
Was made in the halls of the dark kingdom<br>
To steal their riches<br>
To slave them all<br>
To make them kneel for a new God</p>
<p>The Guard woke up the sleeping men<br>
With the sound of a bronze horn<br>
The enemy is getting closer<br>
So brace yourselves for assault!</p>
<p>Swords in their hands they killed each and every man<br>
Who dared to invade their sacred land<br>
Victory songs are raising in the night<br>
Telling all of their undying strength and might</p>
<p>Arrows are raining from the sky<br>
As brothers fight side by side<br>
We’re outnumbered<br>
But our destiny is to win</p>
<p>FIGHT!<br>
Fight with the rage of a bear!<br>
DEFEND!<br>
Our homeland!<br>
CRUSH!<br>
Crush every enemy!<br>
AND SEAL!<br>
Our victory!</p>
<p>Swords in their hands they killed each and every man<br>
Who dared to invade their sacred land<br>
Victory songs are raising in the night<br>
Telling all of their undying strength and might</p>
<p>Ei urhot kaukaisen Pohjolan<br>

<pre><code class="lang-auto">Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
Susanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Won't you look down upon me, Jesus
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Been walking my mind to an easy time my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things
to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you fire and rain, now </code></pre>

Song:Blood Is The Price Of Glory</p>
<p>[Code]Before the grimmest enemy<br>
Cold rain whipping those proud faces<br>
Warcries raising their spirits<br>
Despising death as they rush forward<br>
Blood of the brothers drains to the ground<br>
Stirring up rage, giving the power<br>
Trampling the enemy with their feet<br>
Without fear they fight</p>
<p>Can you hear the call of the North star<br>
Feel its longing in your heart<br>
This bound is eternal<br>
Sworn through blood<br>
At the end we will stand as one!<br>
Even if the daylight dies<br>
Our horde marches on and on<br>
If we should fall down to the ground<br>
We’ll rise again and never give up!</p>
<p>But for some it’s all too much<br>
This honorable battle and bloodshed<br>
They flee like a swarm of craven rats<br>
Leaving their brothers to a certain death<br>
The last furious men<br>
They didn’t fear death or pain<br>
They held up their swords and shields<br>
As winners they stood on the battlefield</p>
<p>Can you hear the call of the North star<br>
Feel its longing in your heart<br>
This bound is eternal<br>
Sworn through blood<br>

Even if the daylight dies<br>
Our horde marches on and on<br>
If we should fall down to the ground<br>
We’ll rise again and never give up!</p>
<p>Run away you cowards<br>
We turn our backs on you<br>
The shame that now stains your name<br>
Will only brighten our glory<br>
Those who fight till their last breath<br>
And fall with honour<br>
Their names and deeds shall live forever<br>
Never to be forgotten</p>
<p>No axe stayed in your weak hand<br>
No shield protected you from the blows of enemies<br>
Get out of our sight<br>
The war has no need for traitors</p>

<p>Song: Victory Song</p>
<p>[code]The plan of invasion<br>
an Evil deception<br>
Was made in the halls of the dark kingdom<br>
To steal their riches<br>
To slave them all<br>
To make them kneel for a new God</p>

With the sound of a bronze horn<br>
The enemy is getting closer<br>

As brothers fight side by side<br>
We’re outnumbered<br>
But our destiny is to win</p>

Fight with the rage of a bear!<br>

Susanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Won't you look down upon me, Jesus
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Been walking my mind to an easy time my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things
to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you fire and rain, now </code></pre>

Cold rain whipping those proud faces<br>

Blood of the brothers drains to the ground<br>
Stirring up rage, giving the power<br>
Trampling the enemy with their feet<br>
Without fear they fight</p>
<p>Can you hear the call of the North star<br>
Feel its longing in your heart<br>
This bound is eternal<br>
Sworn through blood<br>
At the end we will stand as one!<br>
Even if the daylight dies<br>
Our horde marches on and on<br>
If we should fall down to the ground<br>
We’ll rise again and never give up!</p>
<p>But for some it’s all too much<br>
This honorable battle and bloodshed<br>
They flee like a swarm of craven rats<br>
Leaving their brothers to a certain death<br>
The last furious men<br>
They didn’t fear death or pain<br>
They held up their swords and shields<br>
As winners they stood on the battlefield</p>

<p>Run away you cowards<br>
We turn our backs on you<br>
The shame that now stains your name<br>
Will only brighten our glory<br>
Those who fight till their last breath<br>
And fall with honour<br>
Their names and deeds shall live forever<br>
Never to be forgotten</p>
<p>No axe stayed in your weak hand<br>
No shield protected you from the blows of enemies<br>
Get out of our sight<br>
The war has no need for traitors</p>

<p>Favorite Lines would be:<br>
Song:Blood Is The Price Of Glory</p>
<p>[Code]Before the grimmest enemy<br>
Cold rain whipping those proud faces<br>
Warcries raising their spirits<br>
Despising death as they rush forward<br>
Blood of the brothers drains to the ground<br>
Stirring up rage, giving the power<br>
Trampling the enemy with their feet<br>
Without fear they fight</p>
<p>Can you hear the call of the North star<br>
Feel its longing in your heart<br>
This bound is eternal<br>
Sworn through blood<br>
At the end we will stand as one!<br>
Even if the daylight dies<br>
Our horde marches on and on<br>
If we should fall down to the ground<br>
We’ll rise again and never give up!</p>
<p>But for some it’s all too much<br>
This honorable battle and bloodshed<br>
They flee like a swarm of craven rats<br>
Leaving their brothers to a certain death<br>
The last furious men<br>
They didn’t fear death or pain<br>
They held up their swords and shields<br>
As winners they stood on the battlefield</p>
<p>Can you hear the call of the North star<br>
Feel its longing in your heart<br>
This bound is eternal<br>
Sworn through blood<br>
At the end we will stand as one!<br>
Even if the daylight dies<br>
Our horde marches on and on<br>
If we should fall down to the ground<br>
We’ll rise again and never give up!</p>
<p>Run away you cowards<br>
We turn our backs on you<br>
The shame that now stains your name<br>
Will only brighten our glory<br>
Those who fight till their last breath<br>
And fall with honour<br>
Their names and deeds shall live forever<br>
Never to be forgotten</p>
<p>No axe stayed in your weak hand<br>
No shield protected you from the blows of enemies<br>
Get out of our sight<br>
The war has no need for traitors</p>
<p>Can you hear the call of the North star<br>
Feel its longing in your heart<br>
This bound is eternal<br>
Sworn through blood<br>
At the end we will stand as one!<br>
Even if the daylight dies<br>
Our horde marches on and on<br>
If we should fall down to the ground<br>
We’ll rise again and never give up!<br>

<p>Song: Victory Song</p>
<p>[code]The plan of invasion<br>
an Evil deception<br>
Was made in the halls of the dark kingdom<br>
To steal their riches<br>
To slave them all<br>
To make them kneel for a new God</p>
<p>The Guard woke up the sleeping men<br>
With the sound of a bronze horn<br>
The enemy is getting closer<br>
So brace yourselves for assault!</p>
<p>Swords in their hands they killed each and every man<br>
Who dared to invade their sacred land<br>
Victory songs are raising in the night<br>
Telling all of their undying strength and might</p>
<p>Arrows are raining from the sky<br>
As brothers fight side by side<br>
We’re outnumbered<br>
But our destiny is to win</p>
<p>FIGHT!<br>
Fight with the rage of a bear!<br>
DEFEND!<br>
Our homeland!<br>
CRUSH!<br>
Crush every enemy!<br>
AND SEAL!<br>
Our victory!</p>
<p>Swords in their hands they killed each and every man<br>
Who dared to invade their sacred land<br>
Victory songs are raising in the night<br>
Telling all of their undying strength and might</p>
<p>Ei urhot kaukaisen Pohjolan<br>
Uhan eessä taipuneet<br>
Jälleen pauhaa kansi taivahan<br>
Veri valuu maahan lumiseen<br>
Moni nähdä ei saa huomista<br>
Moni jää heitä kaipaamaan<br>
Jälkipolville jää maa rauhaisa<br>

<blockquote>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
Susanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Won't you look down upon me, Jesus
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Been walking my mind to an easy time my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things
to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you fire and rain, now </code></pre>
