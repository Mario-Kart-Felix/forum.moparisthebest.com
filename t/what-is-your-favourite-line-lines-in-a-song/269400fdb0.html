Song:Blood Is The Price Of Glory</p>
<p>[Code]Before the grimmest enemy<br>
Cold rain whipping those proud faces<br>
Warcries raising their spirits<br>
Despising death as they rush forward<br>
Blood of the brothers drains to the ground<br>
Stirring up rage, giving the power<br>
Trampling the enemy with their feet<br>
Without fear they fight</p>
<p>Can you hear the call of the North star<br>
Feel its longing in your heart<br>
This bound is eternal<br>
Sworn through blood<br>
At the end we will stand as one!<br>
Even if the daylight dies<br>
Our horde marches on and on<br>
If we should fall down to the ground<br>
We’ll rise again and never give up!</p>
<p>But for some it’s all too much<br>
This honorable battle and bloodshed<br>
They flee like a swarm of craven rats<br>
Leaving their brothers to a certain death<br>
The last furious men<br>
They didn’t fear death or pain<br>
They held up their swords and shields<br>
As winners they stood on the battlefield</p>
<p>Can you hear the call of the North star<br>
Feel its longing in your heart<br>
This bound is eternal<br>
Sworn through blood<br>
At the end we will stand as one!<br>
Even if the daylight dies<br>
Our horde marches on and on<br>
If we should fall down to the ground<br>
We’ll rise again and never give up!</p>
<p>Run away you cowards<br>
We turn our backs on you<br>
The shame that now stains your name<br>
Will only brighten our glory<br>
Those who fight till their last breath<br>
And fall with honour<br>
Their names and deeds shall live forever<br>
Never to be forgotten</p>
<p>No axe stayed in your weak hand<br>
No shield protected you from the blows of enemies<br>
Get out of our sight<br>
The war has no need for traitors</p>
<p>Can you hear the call of the North star<br>
Feel its longing in your heart<br>
This bound is eternal<br>
Sworn through blood<br>
At the end we will stand as one!<br>
Even if the daylight dies<br>
Our horde marches on and on<br>
If we should fall down to the ground<br>
We’ll rise again and never give up!<br>

<p>Song: Victory Song</p>
<p>[code]The plan of invasion<br>
an Evil deception<br>
Was made in the halls of the dark kingdom<br>
To steal their riches<br>
To slave them all<br>
To make them kneel for a new God</p>
<p>The Guard woke up the sleeping men<br>
With the sound of a bronze horn<br>
The enemy is getting closer<br>
So brace yourselves for assault!</p>
<p>Swords in their hands they killed each and every man<br>
Who dared to invade their sacred land<br>
Victory songs are raising in the night<br>
Telling all of their undying strength and might</p>
<p>Arrows are raining from the sky<br>
As brothers fight side by side<br>
We’re outnumbered<br>
But our destiny is to win</p>
<p>FIGHT!<br>
Fight with the rage of a bear!<br>
DEFEND!<br>
Our homeland!<br>
CRUSH!<br>
Crush every enemy!<br>
AND SEAL!<br>
Our victory!</p>
<p>Swords in their hands they killed each and every man<br>
Who dared to invade their sacred land<br>
Victory songs are raising in the night<br>
Telling all of their undying strength and might</p>
<p>Ei urhot kaukaisen Pohjolan<br>

<pre><code class="lang-auto">Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
Susanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Won't you look down upon me, Jesus
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Been walking my mind to an easy time my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things
to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you fire and rain, now </code></pre>

<p>BWAAHHAAHHAAHAH SERIOUSLY! That band’s screaming faggy Emo Scene.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>BWHAHAHA tht is a fucking country song by James Taylor  and also you obviously have your own opinion and just because you dont like them, doesnt mean they suck… so fuck you <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> x[/quote]</p>
<p>I was implying that the band isn’t faggy emo scene but the lyrics sound as if they’re wanting or trying to be.<br>
And James Taylor Sucks anyway, he’s horrible I don’t know why you’d  laugh at me because I don’t know the lyrics for James Taylor songs.</p>

Trampling the enemy with their feet<br>
Without fear they fight</p>
<p>Can you hear the call of the North star<br>
Feel its longing in your heart<br>
This bound is eternal<br>
Sworn through blood<br>

Even if the daylight dies<br>
Our horde marches on and on<br>
If we should fall down to the ground<br>
We’ll rise again and never give up!</p>
<p>But for some it’s all too much<br>
This honorable battle and bloodshed<br>
They flee like a swarm of craven rats<br>
Leaving their brothers to a certain death<br>
The last furious men<br>
They didn’t fear death or pain<br>
They held up their swords and shields<br>
As winners they stood on the battlefield</p>

<p>Run away you cowards<br>
We turn our backs on you<br>
The shame that now stains your name<br>
Will only brighten our glory<br>
Those who fight till their last breath<br>
And fall with honour<br>
Their names and deeds shall live forever<br>
Never to be forgotten</p>
<p>No axe stayed in your weak hand<br>
No shield protected you from the blows of enemies<br>
Get out of our sight<br>
The war has no need for traitors</p>

<pre><code class="lang-auto">Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
Susanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Won't you look down upon me, Jesus
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Been walking my mind to an easy time my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things
to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you fire and rain, now </code></pre>

Blood of the brothers drains to the ground<br>
Stirring up rage, giving the power<br>
Trampling the enemy with their feet<br>
Without fear they fight</p>

Feel its longing in your heart<br>
This bound is eternal<br>
Sworn through blood<br>
At the end we will stand as one!<br>
Even if the daylight dies<br>
Our horde marches on and on<br>
If we should fall down to the ground<br>
We’ll rise again and never give up!</p>
<p>But for some it’s all too much<br>
This honorable battle and bloodshed<br>
They flee like a swarm of craven rats<br>
Leaving their brothers to a certain death<br>
The last furious men<br>
They didn’t fear death or pain<br>
They held up their swords and shields<br>
As winners they stood on the battlefield</p>

<p>Run away you cowards<br>
We turn our backs on you<br>
The shame that now stains your name<br>
Will only brighten our glory<br>
Those who fight till their last breath<br>
And fall with honour<br>
Their names and deeds shall live forever<br>
Never to be forgotten</p>
<p>No axe stayed in your weak hand<br>
No shield protected you from the blows of enemies<br>
Get out of our sight<br>
The war has no need for traitors</p>

Susanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Won't you look down upon me, Jesus
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Been walking my mind to an easy time my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things
to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you fire and rain, now </code></pre>

It seems I walk this hard trail alone
Come danger take them all
Then throw them at the walls
Lost
Why won't you let me go
What does your father feel
There is no point is your papa not living now
I'm gonna tear off the legs of the one that killed
Me the most powerfull human of all
Woe
I a missing father
An empty role
Why did this immortal good child forget me
Why'd a mans own father blow these
Heartstrings away
Thrice have I called for blood I want the undead child
Why wouldn't fate let this unborn child
Die a wooden blow
Please
Kill
Him</code></pre>

Daydream, I dream of you amid the flowers, for a couple of hours, such a beautiful day. 
<p>I dream a dirty dream of ya baby<br>
you’re crawling on the bathroom floor,<br>
you float around the room and you’re naked,<br>

<p>Because it really doesn’t match the tone of the music at all, and it makes me laugh when I hear it. Especially in the I Monster version lol, it’s like music steganography.</p>
