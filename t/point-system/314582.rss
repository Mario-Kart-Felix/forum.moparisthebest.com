    <description>Okay, well.
i want to be able to use party crackers, with the Party hats coming from them when used on another played, like in real rs.

But, to earn the party crackers, i want them to be earned by getting points from like kbd?

So like its just basically earning the crackers from a point shop.

Anyone know how i cna do that?</description>

              <p>Create an integer and have that integer rise when the KBD is killed.</p>
<p>Base code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public int kbdPoints = 0;</code></pre>
<p><code>if(npcID == 50) {
kbdPoints++;
}</code></p>
<p>That will rise the kbdPoints integer by one.</p>
<p>Note: No, you canâ€™t copy and paste that and expect it to work. You will also probably have to mess around in NPCHandler a bit.</p>
