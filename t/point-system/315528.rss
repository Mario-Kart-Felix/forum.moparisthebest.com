    <title>Point System</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/point-system/315528</link>
    <description>I just want to make a shop that has items like, Party hats and stuff.

But instead of being able to pay with them by cash,
I would like to make a Point system, Like example.

You fight KBD, and earn say 20 points, out of like 3000 needed for a pat.

How do i set it up?</description>
