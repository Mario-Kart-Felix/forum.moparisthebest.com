    <title>How do you link a source with a client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-you-link-a-source-with-a-client/306805</link>
    <description>Before you call me an idiot, I&#39;m pretty new to server making, so give me a break : p

So anyway, i now have my source fully functional and i downloaded some dogey client which i can log onto and play as normal.

But how do I allow other people to play my server with a client? I&#39;m pretty quick to catch on to new things so rather than call me an idiot just try and help (:

EDIT- I noticed when i log in it quickly says &quot;connecting to 127.0.0.1&quot; do i somehow have to change that to almostscape.no-ip.info for people to join? assuming they also have the client.

EDIT2- Ok i found the spot i think.. in client.java where it had 127.0.0.1 and i changed it to almostscape.no-ip.info. So is that correct? is that what I&#39;m meant to do?

oh and also, when i run the client it still says the old name up the top, like... on the blue window bar (transparent for vista) and it says &quot;X-Client&quot; i want it to say &quot;Almost-Scape Client&quot; how do i change that?</description>
