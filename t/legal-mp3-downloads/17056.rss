    <description>I was shocked when i found this, and figured out it actually worked, lol. Enjoy it. NFO : You may have to register a free account (no cc required).

1. Visit The Site

http://www.radioblogclub.com/

2. Search

Type the name of the band or the song that you want to search for. In this case, I’m searching for “Tool”.

3. Select the Song You Want



Now there’s a list of songs. In order to select the song you want, click it’s BLUE play button.

Look towards the right column and you’ll notice that something like the following has appeared.

4. Find The Actual Song Within The Code



In the grey box, there is lots of code. But to make it easier to filter out the actual song, only select the text starting from “FlashVars…” as shown in the pic. Make sure you select EVERYTHING that’s after this text then continue.

5. Paste The Code Into The Address Bar And Download!



Once you paste the code into the address bar, you’ll have something like the above. Now you must butcher the code! Erase everything BEFORE the “http://” and AFTER the “.rbs” and you’ll end up with something like this:
. Now press enter and download it when prompted! You’re almost done!

6. BUT WAIT!


After downloading the song, you may notice that Windows doesn’t know what to open it in, this is because the file ends in “.rbs” which isn’t recognised by Windows. However, this is only a basic ploy to stop people downloading the song because it’s actually a “.mp3″ which has been renamed to fool people! What you need to do is raname the file!

A “.rbs” file.

Right click the file and select “Rename”.

Change the file extension to “.mp3″.

VOILA!

Double click the file and it will now open in your preferred Media Player. It might seem a bit daunting to have to do this for every song, but you’ll soon get the hang of it!
