But one of the teenagers threatened to take out his gun, how would he stop him without the teen shooting while trying to get it from him?</p>

              <p>Even with training it’s still hard to hit someone in the arm without the risk to inflict a deadly wound. Especially with a pistol. A pastor isn’t trained to deal with these situations, so he’s nervous. A pistol shot in the shoulder from a distance can easily turn into a bullet in the lungs, or even worse, in the heart.</p>

<p>So everyone who supports themselves lacks faith too?  Surely if you believe in God that means you don’t have to do anything for yourself, feed yourself, protect yourself, use doctors, God will take care of it all?</p>
<p>I guess there are a handful of religions that do think this way, but the vast majority by far don’t.  God gave us intelligence and the means to help ourselves and it would be an insult not to avail ourselves of those gifts.</p>

<p>Actually, in most states (like mine), you have to have training to be eligible for a concealed carry permit.  Also, basically every law abiding citizen that carries a gun knows how to use it.</p>
