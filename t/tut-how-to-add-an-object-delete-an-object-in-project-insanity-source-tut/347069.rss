    <description>Okay here goes... This took me forever to find out (and i searched for a very long time!) so please, if I have done something wrong or different to how you did, please dont flame me, just let me know and i will edit/add it into tut :)

Go into your Server folder &gt; src &gt; Server &gt; World

Then open up ObjectManager.java

Then press CTRL+F and search for this: [code]public void loadCustomSpawns(Client c)[/code]

Underneath it you should find some of the custom objects which whoever u got ur &quot;Base Source&quot; from has put in for example: Some Bank Booth&#39;s at Home

Underneath what is already there, put in this: [code]		c.getPA().checkObjectSpawn(ItemID, PosX, PosY, 1, 10);[/code]  Obviously change:
ItemID for the Item ID of the thing u want to have there (Bank booth ID is 2213)
PosX for the &quot;X&quot; Co-ordinate of where u want the item to be.
PosY for the &quot;Y&quot; Co-ordinate of where u want the item to be.
The next number 1 can be changed to a 2, depending on which way u want the item to be facing
[u][b]LEAVE THE NUMBER 10 ALONE! DO NOT TOUCH![/b][/u] (unless u know what its for lol)

So an example would be, if i wanted a Bank Booth to face towards edgeville wildy in the middle of the &quot;Prayer Guild&quot; i would put this code:
[code]		c.getPA().checkObjectSpawn(2213, 3048, 3488, 2, 10);[/code]

And thats it! Save, Compile and Run your server!

If you found this Tutorial Helpful in any way, please rep++
Many Thanks

P.S. If this TUT is in the wrong section, please could a member of staff move it. Thanks again! :D</description>
