    <description>Hey im DemonWars, Owner and coder of RuneScape DemonWars.

Besides that im working on a v2.5 i am also making a server and client for people who just started coding and don&#39;t know alot of it.

This will be a Server and a Client that will have alot of extras that will make coding alot easier.
Like:

1: a simple command that will generate 3 files that includes a NPC&#39;s dialoge and name.
2: a simple command that will generate a NPC on your current location by only having to add the NPC ID.
3: a simple command that will generate a file that includes a giant code that will add a new item by simply having to add the model ID and the item ID.

More info is coming.

Please reply with ideas and/or comments
