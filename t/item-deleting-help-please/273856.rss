    <title>Item Deleting. Help Please!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/item-deleting-help-please/273856</link>
    <description>Well somehow, nearlly all of my players have got a Party hat, either wearing it, in their inventory or in their bank. None of my admins have dropped them as ive checked command logs.

Theres over 1,800 People have a partyhat out of 4,600 Accounts.

I was wondering if theirs any program I can use To delete an Item. Say i put the item id in, then it deletes it in their character Folder.

I really can NOT be bothered searching through 1,800 Accounts and deleting 1 by 1.

Please Help Guys!

              <p>Economy reset program, it deletes all items in banks and inventory’s, but there isn’t a use in using this if you don’t know the problem, Fix duping or find the source code that gives them out.</p>
