              <p>You didnt mention what base but use your brain to adabpt.</p>
<p>Go to the Login.java folder in Src -&gt; palidino76 -&gt; Rs2 -&gt; io -&gt; Login.java</p>
<p>After that seach         <code>if (p.teleportToX == -1 &amp;&amp; p.teleportToY == -1) {</code></p>
<p>Below that should be something like             	<code>p.setCoords(X, Y, 0);</code></p>
<p>Just change the x to the absX were you want to login at and the Y to the absY were you want to login at. Compile and done.</p>
