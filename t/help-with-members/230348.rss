    <description>Hey, I need some help. On me and my mates server, (we are using rockhard scape source) we need to take off members, can you aid in any way? Perhaps a tutorial on this. Id really appreciate it. Remember, were trying to delete the members system, we want to get rid of it.</description>

              <p>Like, member items?</p>
<p>Well, just delete the requirement.</p>
<p>It should be with your other stat requirements, or whatever.</p>
<p>Or if this a question about like an object that needs membership, go look for the object’s case, and delete the membership requirements from it.</p>
