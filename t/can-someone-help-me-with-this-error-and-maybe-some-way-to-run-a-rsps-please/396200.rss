              <p>That’s an error stating that the batch file can’t find the server.class</p>
<p>Meaning, if you don’t have server.java, there’s no server.class.</p>
<p>Look and see if you have server.java, if you don’t I recommend downloading a new source, and since you’re new, a beginner source. Look in the download section here - <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?board=49.0" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?board=49.0</a></p>
