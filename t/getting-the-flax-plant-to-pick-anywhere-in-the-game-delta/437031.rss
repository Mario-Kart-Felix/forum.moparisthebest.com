    <title>Getting the Flax plant to pick ANYWHERE in the game (Delta)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-the-flax-plant-to-pick-anywhere-in-the-game-delta/437031</link>
    <description>As most people are aware, flax is a necessity in the creation of bow string. And yet no matter what placing a if(objectID == 2646){ will not make all of the plants work. And that was a means of frustration when I was helping my friend on his client over a year ago. But while working on mine, I discovered something very interesting, that lead me to find the means of making flax pick all over the game. This should actually be in all delta&#39;s, since it is in both mine and my friends old one. But even if it is not, you should be able to add it in. 

Editing: client.java

1 - Open client.java and do a search for &quot;atobject2&quot;. Now hopefully right below the int list, you should have:

[code]
			if ((objectID == 2646) &amp;&amp; ((absX &gt;= 2735) &amp;&amp; (absX &lt;= 2752))
					&amp;&amp; ((absY &gt;= 3435) &amp;&amp; (absY &lt;= 3453))) {
				if (now - lastAction &gt;= 900) {
					addItem(1779, 1);
					lastAction = now;
				}
			}[/code]
If not, add it directly under this:
[code]long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
			boolean oFound = false;[/code]

For newer people, this can be very confusing as it is using a abs code that is very rarely seen
[code]if ((objectID == 2646) &amp;&amp; ((absX &gt;= 2735) &amp;&amp; (absX &lt;= 2752))[/code]
As you might know, absX &amp; absX represent the players position. What this line is doing is taking it a step further. Rather than a singular position, it is providing a range. absX &gt;= and &lt;= absX provide a length of east to west in this code. That being 2735 ---&gt;2752.
[code]&amp;&amp; ((absY &gt;= 3435) &amp;&amp; (absY &lt;= 3453))) {[/code]
in the second portion of this code, you find the absY positions governing the south to north line. Now before continuing, if you place these positions together (And teleport to them) you will discover this is the Seer&#39;s Village flax farm. 
[code]                               if (now - lastAction &gt;= 900) {
					addItem(1779, 1);
					lastAction = now;[/code]
I do apologize as I do not quite understand the first and last line of this part of the code. But I know it seemingly has no effect on the picking of the plant which is found in addItem(1779, 1);

Now that we have the explanation (reason for the explanation coming shortly, lets set this up to pick all over the world shall we?

what you will need to do is change both
[code]((absX &gt;= 2735) &amp;&amp; (absX &lt;= 2752))
					&amp;&amp; ((absY &gt;= 3435) &amp;&amp; (absY &lt;= 3453))) {[/code]
To
[code]((absX &gt;= 1000) &amp;&amp; (absX &lt;= 100000))
					&amp;&amp; ((absY &gt;= 1000) &amp;&amp; (absY &lt;= 100000))) {[/code]
This sets the east/west &amp; south/north radius to cover the entire game. As far as I know there is only one place within the 1000 mark of coords, and it is the giant mole den. (No flax there) This will allow you to pick flax, no matter where it is located, or where you place it. 

The reason for the explanation is you will find, if you like everything working as much as I do, that there are 4 other types of plants that have the same issue if you just place them in a if(objectID == ****){ code. Since I am providing the means of making those other four work here, I think I will let you discover them on your own. :) But this is the way in which you get the flax to pick every time. You can even include a playerLevel[] in your code if you wish. Or perhaps a certain item has to be in your inventory/weilded in order to pick it. Literally it is endless as to what you can do with it.</description>

I am learning about events atm…since I am really beginning to think this is where my solution to my final farming problem lies. Right now I cannot focus on the larger things…smaller ones for that fact either. bad news in family makes my mind just shut down on anything other than lol. But when I learn the events completely, I would surely be releasing a tutorial that will work for new people so they do not have to deal the frustration of learning. (I think I am the only person around anymore that thrills at learning something new lol.)<br>
Thanks for all the positive feedback though. Beginning to feel like I am working this coding into the right direction <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
