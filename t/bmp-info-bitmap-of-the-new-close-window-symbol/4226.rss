    <title>[BMP + Info] Bitmap of the new Close Window Symbol! [ ~ ]</title>

    <description>[b]Hi Everyone,

In the new Update, 27/06/06, they updated the &quot;Close Window&quot; to a Boxed &quot;X&quot;.
Here is the Bitmap I just thought would be a good contribution to Mopar&#39;s Forum[/b]

[b]All ready for Scripting use[/b] :D


[b]EDIT: Here is the change for the new update:[/b]


&lt;blockquote&gt;This week&#39;s update focuses entirely on fixing some of the new features we have added to the game recently. Obviously we try and keep our updates bug free, but just like those pesky shrimp, a few slip through the net, so we have been busy hunting down some of the more obscure issues and correcting them. After all, improving and fixing existing updates is just as important as releasing new ones.

We&#39;re also working hard on making July a really impressive month, packed with minigames, new spells and some rather interesting quests. We&#39;re sure you won&#39;t be disappointed.

Projects mentioned in June&#39;s Behind the Scenes article but not yet released (such as the brewing minigame and the non-members&#39; security update) have been delayed for a little extra testing, but worry not, as we&#39;ll make them available next month instead. And that&#39;s in addition to all the stuff we already had planned for July...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

              <p>That must’ve been lots of work to get that!!! Lol. Thanks. I like the new X. It makes it easier to close the windows, sorta like a target. X marks the spot! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
