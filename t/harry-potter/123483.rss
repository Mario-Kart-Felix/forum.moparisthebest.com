    <description>Today a few actresses from the Harry Potter movie(s) came to Finland, and I went there to see them. I had my mobile phone with me, so don&#39;t blame me for the lame pictures. There was also like a thousand people there, literally, thousand.

The red hair is Ginny (Bonnie Wright) and the black hair is Cho (Katie Leung)

Then there&#39;s Katie (Cho) again and here&#39;s my last picture

with Bonnie (Ginny), I honestly couldn&#39;t go closer, but you can spot her because of the red hair.</description>

<p>They cut the entire best part of the book, fucking shit up in the Ministry of Magic. When I read the book that was the part I thought would be the best in the film, by far. They cut all that shit out. And then during the final duel between OotP and DE almost all of the spell effects were <span class="bbcode-b">sparks</span>. I don’t pay 8.50$ for a ticket and 15$ for snacks popcorn and soda for special effects that look early '90s at best. And they had to go and steal the dragon effect from Lord of the Rings instead of using the visual description from book. Is JK Rowling locked in a basement somewhere or what? They just send out a body double to chill on the red carpet and smile as if she approves of the utter bullshit that passes for a motion picture.</p>

<p>She’s not supposed to look good in the movie… the way Rowling writes the books shows how she is growing up, becoming more bolder and rebellious and how sexy she is becoming (obviously this isn’t the main storyline… I wish) . If you see the red carpet shots of her… she’s hot. Hopefully in the 7th movie they’ll make her the best looking shizzle ever!</p>
<p>The 5th movie (i took a day off school to see it on the day it came out) was amazing. The fight scenes were great and although they left out alot, they also included alot. I think some people (PaulT) need to stop being so ungrateful with these films. It only cost a few pounds to watch a film and there’s no need to nit pick. Just sit back and enjoy the film and if you don’t like it at least have a good reason to not like it.</p>
<p>Oh well… I like Harry Potter quite alot and the 7th book is going to be answering all of my questions about the whole series. I can’t wait to read the discussions on it because they help me realise more stuff i may have missed. Gee whizz I’ve written my fair share. Ummm… I’d like to thank my mum and my… food for bring me to life and keeping me alive <em>bows</em> Thank you people!!</p>

<p>Yea seriously, if Emma wasn’t in the movie, I might not have bothered to watch.  But regardless, it wasn’t bad.  It was still a decent movie, though they left out a lot of details.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I thought it was terrible. It appeared as though half the time Harry’s friends just forgot their lines and stood there breathlessly. There were good parts, but so many good parts were cut and characters left out, it was sad. It was the same in the other movies, but at least they tried to pack them with detail and throw references in. In Order of the Phoenix it felt more like they left the wrong parts in, and gave the good parts they did manage to leave too little screen time. A whole lot of the spell effects were just sparks and the Ministry of Magic was extremely disappointing. If they had made a two hour film of the last couple chapters of the book it would have been more satisfying for me, at least.</p>

<p>My impression is that if I didn’t read the books, I’d have no fucking clue what was going on.  But it was a nice treat.  Not to mention Emma.</p>

<p>I thought it was terrible. It appeared as though half the time Harry’s friends just forgot their lines and stood there breathlessly. There were good parts, but so many good parts were cut and characters left out, it was sad. It was the same in the other movies, but at least they tried to pack them with detail and throw references in. In Order of the Phoenix it felt more like they left the wrong parts in, and gave the good parts they did manage to leave too little screen time. A whole lot of the spell effects were just sparks and the Ministry of Magic was extremely disappointing. If they had made a two hour film of the last couple chapters of the book it would have been more satisfying for me, at least.</p>

              <p>Today a few actresses from the Harry Potter movie(s) came to Finland, and I went there to see them. I had my mobile phone with me, so don’t blame me for the lame pictures. There was also like a thousand people there, literally, thousand.<br>

The red hair is Ginny (Bonnie Wright) and the black hair is Cho (Katie Leung)<br>

Then there’s Katie (Cho) again and here’s my last picture<br>

with Bonnie (Ginny), I honestly couldn’t go closer, but you can spot her because of the red hair.</p>
