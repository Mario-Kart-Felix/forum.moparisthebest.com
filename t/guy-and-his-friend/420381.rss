    <title>Guy and his friend</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/guy-and-his-friend/420381</link>
    <description>I recently wrote a small engine in flash for creating shooters. I&#39;ve used it to create a game called Guy and his friend.


Here is the storyline and I need opinions because I&#39;m not sure if I should go with it, also opinions on the title are welcome.
I need this game to be finished because I need some money fast and I&#39;m planning to sell the game.



When the world got ruled by the dead, things got hard for Guy and his friend.


Luckily, Guy has a friend that is immune for the zombie virus.
In fact, by eating zombies, Guy&#39;s friend gets bigger!


However, Guy&#39;s friend can only kill zombies that are smaller than him.
Guy, on the other hand, can kill just about any zombie with his guns.
Zombies killed by Guy also get eaten by Guy&#39;s friend.


Guy and his friend landed into a situation where Guy has to shoot zombies from the backseat of a car.
His friend has to kill and eat zombies smaller than him in order to grow bigger and be able to eat bigger zombies.


It is up to you to decide the faith of Guy and his friend.


I know its weird, but it&#39;s the best I could come up with.


The storyline pretty much tells you all you need to know about the game.</description>

<p>Have you got anything to show us? :)[/quote]I used the engine to finish the original game it was designed for, Vreggie Fish. So this project is dead.<br>
Reason for this was, I started the development of Guy and his friend, did some animating, then I realized that there was tons of work left in order to make Guy and his friend a decent game for a decent price.</p>
<p>So I decided to finish Vreggie Fish, because most of Vreggie Fish’s graphical work and sfx is finished.<br>
I coded a base dynamic first level for the game in order to be able to easily add other levels by changing some properties such as enemy hp’s, enemy speed,…</p>
<p>Most of the work is done, but it is not ready for showing off.<br>
However, when the game is finished, the Arcade Room will be the first place I’ll release it to.</p>
<p>I’m in a hurry because I need money and I need to start working on Result of the End Online (3D MMORPG).</p>
