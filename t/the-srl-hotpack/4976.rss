    <title>The SRL &quot;Hotpack&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-srl-hotpack/4976</link>
    <description>Greetings all,

Earlier today, I was preparing for the big bang at the SRL forums by downloading the SRL hotpack our dear friend, Fakawi, posted for us developers&#39; use.  Unfortunately, I was away for the day and missed the comedy train.  Anyways, as I was downloading the SRL hotpack(11% done. I have dial-up), a devastating error occured.  I knew what had happened and I knew it was bad.  Fakawi had pulled the plug.  Now, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to contact Fakawi, so I was wondering if anyone had downloaded the SRL hotpack in time and if so, would they please mind sharing it with me.  

Thanks all,

Kernel Klink</description>
