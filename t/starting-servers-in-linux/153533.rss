    <title>Starting servers in linux</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/starting-servers-in-linux/153533</link>
    <description>usually I do a simple [code]java server[/code] in the terminal to load the server
obviously I can&#39;t run the batchfiles most server distributions include along with the server code, and unfortunately copy and paste methods don&#39;t work.

I&#39;m wondering if by simply executing [code]java server[/code] if I&#39;m missing something. Are there any other linux users out there who have encountered issues such as missing data whilst running server code? Have you found a solution to that?

Mostly I notice errors regarding to files not being found due to code written for windows file system architectures and not linux fs architectures.</description>
