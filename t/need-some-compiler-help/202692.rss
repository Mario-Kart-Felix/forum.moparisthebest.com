    <description>Hey allz,

I am a nub at coding i know that, so dont flame me or wteva... i am creating my server and whenever i compile it, it always come up with 100 errors if i try to fix it, alter it, it doesn&#39;t change its still 100 errors and the old code is still there and yes i had saved the client.java, i&#39;m not that stupid.
So, some basic help i need to know, what a:

Expression is, i keep getting illegal start of an expression

a statement, keep getting &quot;so and so&quot; is not a statement, so need to know what i am doing wrong

(identifier) expected, i dunno what that is...

and all r in client.java so yea i dunno if its the compiler or what but any help would b highly appreciated thanks

              <p>Hi, it would be more helpful to US for you to post a picture, or explain more accurately what the error is…<br>
Also if you’re sure you have fixed it properly make sure it isn’t a different .jav file that has the error  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
