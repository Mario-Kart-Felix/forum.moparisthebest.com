    <description>Throughout my last five years experience writing programs (mostly extensive PHP stuff and minor C++ now), I&#39;ve noticed that there is a similar trend with every time I tend to program now -- a lack of ideas. Because of this trend, I can speculate that computer programming will never be something that can keep me busy for a long period of time, as I thought so in the past. It seems to me as though computer programming is best to be something you learn over time and get better at, but never actually use on a daily basis, since that would be boring and ruin the fun of it. Because of this, I&#39;ve changed the focus of my career towards Electrical Engineering, where it seems that I will learn a whole lot more and I can actually work with physical systems and soldering, etc. Thoughts on this?</description>

outsourcing is starting to diminish as companies are realizing how awful it is for them<br>
and it was never that popular for software engineering, theres a lot more outsourcing for QA</p>
<p>but sure we all reach the point where we run out of ideas, i cant remember the last time i worked on a project for fun. thats why i got a job :x</p>
