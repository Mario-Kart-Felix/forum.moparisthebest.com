    <description>Hey all!
We are making a brand new revamp of our old server, and we need some trusty coders! This is a great way for any good coders to show off their work, we&#39;ll be providing full credits and you can be assured that your work is in safe, trusted hands. We can&#39;t pay cash YET, but we&#39;ll make sure you are recognized, offer forums ranks and ingame ranks AND when we get donations, we&#39;ll pay what we can.

So, if you want to help code a great project, please fill in this form and comment below.
We are developing Erasedpkz client so you need knowledge in that area.

First and Last Name:

Date of Birth:

Time Zone:

Past experience in working with Private Servers:

Past experience with RuneScape Private Servers:

Which Languages other than Java do you know:

Examples of your work:

Can you Develop Server-sided content as well:

Other than Private Server Development, please list your capabilities:

How do you wish to be compensated:

How can we contact you:
[/code]

You will be expected to add the following and more:
Interfaces
Auto-updating - Players don&#39;t have to re-download the client if it gets updated.
718 revision items and npcs
Custom maps
Music/Sound system - Sounds and music which can be unlocked and turned off/down.
New unlock-able emotes/animations
Working world map - Zooming and different layers.


We realize it&#39;s a fairly difficult list, and we don&#39;t expect one person to do it all, but if you want to apply you must be able to do at least one of these things.</description>
