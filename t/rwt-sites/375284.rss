    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rwt-sites/375284</link>
    <description>These sites are all based over in China or India.. Has anyone else noticed they all say the same thing when you ask for help, or they all lie to you.. I got lied to 4 times today when I asked how much they got on my account now..

These people are like telling you lies, and then you set them straight and they find an excuse..

They all said the &quot;worker&quot; is offline and will be back in a hour or so. Then they said it will take 10-12 hours to be updated so come back then, when thats exactly what it says on their order tracker.. 

They are so lame. Their lucky it&#39;s not my money on the paypal or I would be raging hard on them.

What about your guy&#39;s experience with them?</description>

Still they can’t the only thing you pay for on Runscape is membership. So either way you cannot be sued.</p>

<p>There is a way of transferring money via GE if you know what your doing. Alot of the time though, when you order something, they will bot your account until it has the cash to obtain the item, or has the amount you purchased.</p>

              <p>Eh, I bought bandos godsword like a year ago from them, all went good until I met a worker of theres, not a actual worker, but a person on the forums who helps out I guess you can say.</p>
<p>I talked to him, he told me talk to him on MSN if I needed anything, hour later after adding him he randomly asked if I can give him a visa gift card to unlimit his account since it was limited, I told him no several times (also took pictures.), and he threaten to delay/stop my order, which at the time I don’t know if he can or can not, contacted an Administrator and it all got sorted out and I believe she made my order quicker, first day of them doing my order they got around a few million, maximum, the following day the order was completed, but anyways, the guy was demoted by the Administrator, he begged for administrator status for a few minutes and ended up banning me and some other guy, and he ended up getting perm banned, and me and the guy who was banned was unbanned, don’t even know why the person made him an administrator afterwards, but oh well.</p>
<p>Some guy named ‘Tmobile’, I believe hes still banned;o Took some time to explain to Lily (a worker, she ended up actually banning him);x</p>
<p>Never used there service afterwards.</p>

<p>They have a feature that you can track your order, I believe it’s updated every few hours(accurate as well)<br>

I know lol (: But yeah usfine was good for keeping an eye on the order… But the people when you asked for information never told me the truth… only Rose did… And she barely could get an answer for me… Gold4rs has been working on my fire cape and tassets for 3 days now… And only got 2m for the tassets so far… And hasn’t started on the fire cape… I was pretty mad when I logged in and seen that… So I made them get the fire cape first and tassets last… Since it was $26.99 for both it was a free fire cape… Thats why I chose them</p>
