    <title>How to shoplift like a champ</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-shoplift-like-a-champ/289852</link>
    <description>I searched Google for shoplifting guides to see if my methods were pointless and if there were any better methods, but every guide I found had many serious flaws and were extremely obvious.
This guide is 60% me. The other 40% goes to my best friends older brother for teaching us in the ways of shoplifting like a champ. I suggest shoplifting as much as possible until you are 18, unless you get caught - I suggest stopping there.
I do not have any advice on what to do if caught - as I have never been caught shoplifting, and neither will you if you follow my guide carefully.
Before I teach you how to shoplift like champs, there are some guidelines we must go through.

Guideline 1

I am not sure if this happens to other people, but when I first started shoplifting, I would get very nervous handing money to the cashier, and I am not sure if they noticed. This is a big give away, calm yourself down walking out of the store or giving money to the cashier.

Guideline 2

If you 100% do not want to get caught, do this - steal an item, but buy a substantially cheaper item, like .99$ candy. Why would someone shoplift if they&#39;re buying something?

Guideline 3

NEVER steal if someone is watching you - shoppers are dickheads

Guideline 4

Don&#39;t shoplift if you are over 18. A college doesn&#39;t want to accept a jackass who got charged for stealing something stupid.

Guideline 5

If someone suspicious is following you EVERYWHERE and you already stole the items, make a quick turn and ditch your merchandise. 


...On to the fun part



The big mistake most people make when they are shoplifting is they will walk into a store, go straight to the item, put it in their POCKET and walk out. This is like hanging a shoplifting sign on your chest.

This man broke the biggest rule in shoplifting like a champ. NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER put ANYTHING into your pocket. Here is why my friend..

If you are caught, you will be made to empty your pockets and any bag of sort you are carrying.

You are not going to put the merchandise in your pocket.. 

Method 1

This works with any type of clothing, I have done this in girl jeans and it still works. 
To make sure nothing falls, you will need a belt. 
The item I steal all the time is a Red Bull - becuase I don&#39;t have 3$ to waste on an energy drink.
Take the item and insert it between your pants and.. you, the belt will support it against your body.
If you are asked to empty your pockets, do it without hesistation.
Walk out the store... like a champ
I have not tried it, but I guess you could put it in the back of your pants instead of the front, but this could end up being a dead giveaway. 

Method 2

I personally have never tried this. A lot of sweatshirts could easily have a hole ripped between two layers of fabric, where you could easily stick something like an Ipod into to sit inside of your sweatshirt. I do not see how you could get caught doing this. Make the hole in a very awkward place, and make it very small.



[b]
PLACES YOU SHOULD NEVER STEAL FROM[/b]

Target
This store actually scares me. They have cameras covering EVERY inch of the store, and employees everywhere.

I have not noticed any other place, but feel free to suggest another store to add to the list.


Places you should steal from..
Drug Stores, CVS, Rite-Aid, etc.
CVS is where I steal my red bulls from. Never been caught.

Wal Mart - 
[quote=&quot;the bank&quot;]Myself and 4 friends spent 2 days planning a walmart shoplift.  On the day of, after following everything we talked about, between the 4 of us we walked out of the store carrying over $350 in video games and two eight gig ipod nanos...all of the merchandise had their electronic triggers removed or nulled.  After walking out of the store we started walking down the walkway away from the store, when 4 men came running after us.  Shit got ugly there.  There was a cop car on the other side of the parking lot, pretty far and wouldn&#39;t of seen anything but still enough to make my already anxious self freak out a little.  We played it cool and kept on walking, with our backbacks carrying all the merchandise.  When they caught up to us, they told as they were store security, and transported us to 3 separate rooms in the back of the store, each appeared to be like security closets with a nice LCD TV showing rotating images of the security cameras.  I used to be so vain, that the thought of stealing the TV actually crossed my mind.

My two friends were charged with theft, all of their bags got opened on their own accord.  I was not carrying anything on me except some things we used to brake those stupid electronic triggers through the wrapping, I was let go but warned that if caught again I would be charged with assisted theft.

Moral of the story: Don&#39;t steal from walmart either.[/quote]
Grocery Stores
Virtually no security

The point of shop lifting is to not be seen by anyone even other shoppers. I’ve done it successfully 3 times, but it’s not just something I do often it’s just for kicks when I’m around my mates. One day I grabbed a can of V (which I don’t even drink soda so I gave it away), 9 packets of gum and a $2 bag of fizz wizz. It’s not hard if you know what to do</p>

What my friends and I have always done is get someone we know in a department in the back of the store to ring us up. We run our card upside down, and they cancel the transaction. We get a receipt and walk out of the store. We’ve gotten so much stuff from this. And it’s nearly full proof, until they check to see why so much shit is missing, and then they run the tapes from those days of the purchases.</p>
<p>Recently got a laptop, ipod touch, a couple external hard drives, a camera, bluetooth headsets, etc.<br>

<p>You get someone you know who works there, to ring you up. In the cameras eyes it looks like you are paying.</p>
