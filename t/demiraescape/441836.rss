    <description>I was always a big fan of Pur3zScape when I was little, I didn&#39;t know how to code at the time so I would watch friends and learn and understand what they are saying to me. I took a blank source from Moparscape because Pur3zScape was no longer excising, so I searched and searched for it but I could not find. So one the idea came to me, What if I could make a re-make. I had looked at google to study where every npc was standing but my cords are a little off. I give 90% to credits to Pur3z. I am not leeching his work just trying to re-create the moment, I&#39;ve added things of my own.

              <p>So is your base Pur3zscape or what?<br>
Also you cant have your website posted in pics without permission from a mod.<br>
I’m guessing it’s a 508 because Dragon claws are a custom item.</p>
<p>It’s starting to look pretty good, so good luck.</p>
