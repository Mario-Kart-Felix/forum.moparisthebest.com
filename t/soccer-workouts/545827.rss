    <title>Soccer Workouts</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/soccer-workouts/545827</link>
    <description>Hey guys. I am looking for intense workouts that will improve my sprinting speed and power. I am a pretty skilled soccer player already as I play for both High School and an elite club team during the off-season. But there is a kid on my High School team that is a senior and we are competing for the starting central mid position. He is a tad quicker than me and has wayy more power than me. Our coach wants us ripping shots from 30 yards away and I can hit them accurately, but with not a lot of power.

My 40 time is an embarrassing 5.4 and I want it to be 4.7-5.0. I am 5&#39;9&quot; and only 125lbs. I am genetically skinny and have an extremely hard time gaining muscle mass. I want some intense workouts that will improve my sprinting time and power on the ball. If anyone knows any good HARD workouts, please let me know :P

Also I am always looking for good drills to help me improve my first touch as well as my understanding of the game.

<p>Improvements to first touch - Set up a square of cones and then place a mini-goal 15 yards away from each of the faces of said square. Get someone to kick the ball at you (vary between in the air, on the ground with power etc) and you have one touch to control it before trying to score.</p>

<p>In terms of just getting shear power on your shots, then I’d say just do box jumps / front squats, can add some form of resistance to it when you get comfortable and that’ll definitely give you some gains.</p>

<p>If you’re wanting to build up on your sprint speed I’d just do suicides or darts, as long as you’re doing some strength and conditioning training as well you should be fine. I’d only say do one solid sprint session a week, with plenty of rest in between your sets of sprints.</p>
<p>p.s generally speaking if you’re wanting that extra bit of pace so you can open up a bit of space in the midfield you’re going to mainly care about using that over the first 10-15 yards once you’re on the ball - as you’ll know if you’re working on your first touch a good way is just straight up knocking the ball in the direction of travel you want and sprinting towards it. ifugetme[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks for all the help man  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
