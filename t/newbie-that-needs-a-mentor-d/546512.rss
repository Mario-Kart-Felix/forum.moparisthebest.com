    <description>Hello Guys/Gals, to be honest I don&#39;t really post much on here, just like to look around. So yeah I need some help...   :(  :confused: :cool:

 I am very new to &quot;Coding&quot; or developing RSPS&#39;s :palm:. I&#39;m the type of person that kind of likes to try things first before asking for help. :D Believe me, i have done that, but to no prevail  :(, i need someone who has some type of experience that i can ask questions to if i have no clue what i am doing and they can help show me so that i know for the next time. I don&#39;t really want someone to code my RSPS for me as much as i want someone to teach me how to code it. I want to code it myself i just don&#39;t know how lol :o. I guess you could say i&#39;m looking for a mentor... :P   Anyhow if anyone of you are willing to help me with this it would be great and i&#39;m sure quite an experience for the both of us. If you are willing to help please either comment, PM, or Skype me.  ;D I would really appreciate it because i have been wanting to learn this for a few years now and it would be really great if i could, so thanks again guys. Hopefully i will be seeing one of you soon  ;D :P :D

(P.S. I&#39;m not one of these 16 year old&#39;s that are just trying to rip off someone else&#39;s work and make a quick profit from it, i actually want to make a really solid server that would be enjoyable for everyone  :D)</description>

              <p>You should download a source, look at the code and just search on google what it means. just like a puzzle. that way you can get the hang of it and later on just take some java lessons on the java website</p>
