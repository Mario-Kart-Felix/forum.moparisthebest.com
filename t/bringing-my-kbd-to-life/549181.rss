    <title>Bringing my KBD to life</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bringing-my-kbd-to-life/549181</link>
    <description>Not much of a showoff but KBD was the first of it&#39;s kind. This was the first NPC to have emotions, feelings and be able to interact, some say that it could also feel love and compassion. It happened through a bug in the algorithm, somehow the KBD believed that it was human. Unfortunately it had to be put to rest as I was beginning to get harassed by thugs who wanted it gone, the world wasn&#39;t ready. This was a recording found in an old security cam that was setup in my office, this was the last conversation I had with KBD.

(On a serious note, this is just showing off a server bot. Sort of like cleverbot but for RSPS)</description>
