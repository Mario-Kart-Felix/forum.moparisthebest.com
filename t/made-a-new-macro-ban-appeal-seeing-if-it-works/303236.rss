    <title>Made a new macro ban appeal seeing if it works</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/made-a-new-macro-ban-appeal-seeing-if-it-works/303236</link>
    <description>i made a new appeal and i am using it on one of my banned accounts. i already made the appeal and am now waiting for when it is over. here is the request i used.

Dear [s]Jagex[/s], i did not autotrain, my younger jappenesse brother was playing it for me all day. he does not speak full english so he probally wouldn&#39;t respawn to any players. im sorry for this inconvienience and i wont let my little younger jappenesse brother use my computer anymore. so please unban me so i can get back to runescape so i can hangout with my friends. thank you

so do you think this will work? lol</description>

<p>You have made a mistake.</p>
<p>What I said was completely sarcastic in nature, and to even suggest that it was an attempt at fraudulent behaviour is utterly fallacious.</p>
<p>I made absolutely no attempt to illicitly acquire anything of value (player’s trust or ‘tangible’ items), and merely did it to mock you - you do deserve it, and the fact that one of you monkeys has muted my account for a year hits that point straight home.</p>
<p>The only thing harmed by my statement was Jagex’s pride. Take it with a pinch of salt, suck it up and maybe even consider fixing the problem so I don’t feel the need to rip you guys off.<br>
The average player doesn’t see through your bullshit, but I certainly do.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t obvious enough to the airheads that you employ, I was having a go at your company for suggesting that your systems are infallible (read: perfect, god-like, incorruptible).<br>
Such a claim is merely dishonest; propagating such a lie makes Jagex a dishonest company.</p>

If they review what I said within the context of the conversation (which was about how their macro detection system is so perfect, rofl) then they’ll have no choice but to lift the mute.<br>
Don’t care in either case, been cold turkey for ~20 days and only went online to tell friends that I was pissing off for a long time. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

What I don’t understand is the whole ‘Apologise’ option.<br>
They never EVER accept your apology and let you off, so why do they expect you to apologise?<br>
Even minor offences stand (on first occasions), despite making an apology.<br>

              <p>Just appealed a year-long mute on my level 125 with this:</p>
<blockquote>You have made a mistake.
<p>What I said was completely sarcastic in nature, and to even suggest that it was an attempt at fraudulent behaviour is utterly fallacious.</p>
<p>I made absolutely no attempt to illicitly acquire anything of value (player’s trust or ‘tangible’ items), and merely did it to mock you - you do deserve it, and the fact that one of you monkeys has muted my account for a year hits that point straight home.</p>
<p>The only thing harmed by my statement was Jagex’s pride. Take it with a pinch of salt, suck it up and maybe even consider fixing the problem so I don’t feel the need to rip you guys off.<br>
The average player doesn’t see through your bullshit, but I certainly do.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t obvious enough to the airheads that you employ, I was having a go at your company for suggesting that your systems are infallible (read: perfect, god-like, incorruptible).<br>
Such a claim is merely dishonest; propagating such a lie makes Jagex a dishonest company.</p>

<p>I win. You guys all need to learn how to have some fun at their expense, honestly. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
If they review what I said within the context of the conversation (which was about how their macro detection system is so perfect, rofl) then they’ll have no choice but to lift the mute.<br>
Don’t care in either case, been cold turkey for ~20 days and only went online to tell friends that I was pissing off for a long time. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>For the record, this is what they nabbed me for:</p>

We are so confident with this approach, in fact, that we don’t even place your account name in the automated messages that we reply with. We’d rather increase the longevity of our computers by minimising SQL transactions to acquire such unimportant details.</p>

<p>Dear fags,</p>
<p>I have an older cousin whose always loved my account. I showed him my great stats and items a while back. He used to live in Germany and always played the German version. He came to live with us to go to school a month ago. Since then he’s been trying to steal my account. He used a keystroke recorder on my computer and got a hold of my password. Since my rs homepage is set to English by default, he could not find the German option so he had to go with english. He thought he had my account for good and spend along time training and earning money. He does not know english so he would not respond to anybody. Then I received my account back after talking to my parents about him. I am sorry and have made my password much harder to find and installed an anti-virus program. By the way I support the Runescape security usb so if you ever release it (I hope you do), then I’ll be the first customer.</p>
<p>Please take some of your time to review my appeal.[/quote]Well, that was better then what the original poster said, but it would still get declined, lol.</p>
