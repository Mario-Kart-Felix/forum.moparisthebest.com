    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-rsc-development-kit-project/335187</link>
    <description>I had an idea to throw together a RSC development kit so it will be very simple for people who are just starting to make a server. It will cut down on loads of topics that have already been answered. It would probably include
[code]
Easyrsc source
RSCD source
Sprite editor 2d and 3d
The id finder (the tool that someone made to easily get the ids for things such as items and objects)
Java + ant set up. 
Download links to other released sources (cut down on requests)
Xampp/wamp guides
other stuff
[/code]
I was also thinking of throwing in a application (because im pretty good at visual basic)that categorized [b]all[/b] posts in the mopar rsc sections into either
[code] 
Error + fix
Idea + how to make
other
[/code]
It would probably also include very, very detailed tutorials. I might even include a advertise section where people can put their link to their[b] rsc [/b] game. The keyword their is rsc. I might even put i list of shame that listes all of the users who posted advertisements for rs2 severs in the rsc section.
Tell me what you guys think. It may cut down on already answered questions/requests.</description>
