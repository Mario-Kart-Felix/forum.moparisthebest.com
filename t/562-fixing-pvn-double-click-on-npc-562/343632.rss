    <title>[562] Fixing PvN/ Double Click on Npc [562]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-fixing-pvn-double-click-on-npc-562/343632</link>
    <description>I have searched everywhere, I even saw source downloads that has this fixed and they all say &quot;Removed to much leechers&quot; or whatever...

This is probably the only thing I have needed help with in a long time..

Where do I go to fix the PvN or double clicking on an npc to attack them?

PvN Aka: Range/Mage on an npc, you have to walk right up to their face and click twice.. :S

I&#39;d appreciate if someone could help me :)
