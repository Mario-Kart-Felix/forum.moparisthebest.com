    <description>Hey i there has been a few client and servers iv downloaded which i cannnot edit..

then there has been a few which the client wont even open etc...

              <p>No requesting, use the search bar to find a server and client. You can edit almost all of them since you can only release open source here.</p>

              <p>thats why they made a server downloads section, if you are to lazy to read throught the threads then you wont find one ever. Because in most of them they are anti leech and you would know that if you actually went onto each thread…</p>
