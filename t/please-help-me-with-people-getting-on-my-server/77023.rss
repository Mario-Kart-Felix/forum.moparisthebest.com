ok, i noob language, HYBRID SCAPE ITS A SERVER THAT IS NOT UPDATED…!!! Download TestScape , its pretty easy to use it, just edit files and compile them (SAve them with a file named compiler or compile). I can tell you step by step how to create your server on MSN messenger, <a href="mailto:daanrack@hotmail.com">daanrack@hotmail.com</a>  or i can tell you on hamachi or here, Ps: its pretty hard to use no-ip, its better to use hamachi<br>

<p>[ul][li]1. Testscape = shit. Pimpscape is better for beginners.[/li]<br>
[li]2. No-ip is not hard to use, the only reason i dont use it is because my router is not compatable with the no-ip duc so i cant use no-ip[/li][/ul][/quote]<br>
it jsut takes port forwarding and at that point you should just use your ip</p>
