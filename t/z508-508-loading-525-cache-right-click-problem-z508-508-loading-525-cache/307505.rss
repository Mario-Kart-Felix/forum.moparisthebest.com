    <description>[Z508, 508 loading 525 cache]right click problem[Z508, 508 loading 525 Cache]

Hello,

I dunno of this is server sided or client sided problem, but right click is really buggy, you know if you right click a for example: Banker

You have the option&#39;s:
Talk
Bank
Cancel

Well if I right click on the banker the Option&#39;s popup for like 0.5 seconds, and than they flash away, so its hard to bank, bank &#39;&#39;ALL&#39; cuz you have to do it really quik, this server isnt public yet, but I can know for sure this cost&#39;s players, since its anoying as hell, Help me please.

Note: I dunno of this is server/client sided so im posting in both section&#39;s.

Thanks for reading, hope to get GOOD help from YOU!</description>
