    <description>So I have always used Skydrive/kept an external HD for files. 

Somebody messaged me and told me to check out Google Drive. Opinions of it? Is it really the best file sharing service out there?

The files would probably consist of business and home files so I would need capabilities of making folders and etc. What type of security does Google Drive offer as well?</description>

              <p>Google Drive seems to be doing pretty well. I use it for school stuff mostly like if I don’t have the time to turn in a paper work by hand to a teacher; I can just create a folder in Google Drive, upload the file - and share it with her.</p>
<p>Though, if you’re asking for opinions, I highly suggest you to use it for school only since it’s a huge benefit. But then, if you are curious of what you could do besides using it for school… one of the things that I do is upload as many things as I want to my own Google Drive folder, and then log-in with my phone and download those files. So, it means that instead of doing everything manually, I can just download the files from my phone in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>But it’s hardly surprising that the internet ‘‘giant’’ has moved to what we have now, Google Drive. As you may know, Google seems to do everything these days.</p>
<p>I hope that helped.<br>
Good luck.</p>

You would be foolish to compare an external harddrive to cloud services. They are entirely different in all capacities of the concept. If you want your stuff backed up so it will never go away, go with cloud services. There’s nothing wrong with dropbox or google drive for just your small personal stuff.

<p>Because the point of the blog is to expose paranoia in people looking for those sort of things. People are over-paranoid about cloud services. Many companies use google docs, which is a cloud service that uses google drive. If it was worth being paranoid, why would so many companies decide to use it? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>While it is the same with Google Drive I’m sure I would imagine for premium users they would have some sort of backup offered?</p>
<p>I don’t know with me working part time in the actual warehouse and part time in the actual office I need something that is dependable to be up when I need it, that is secure(considering we are talking about government), and something that would even possibly offer backups even if it costed more.</p>

<p>Somebody messaged me and told me to check out Google Drive. Opinions of it? Is it really the best file sharing service out there?</p>
<p>The files would probably consist of business and home files so I would need capabilities of making folders and etc. What type of security does Google Drive offer as well?</p>
