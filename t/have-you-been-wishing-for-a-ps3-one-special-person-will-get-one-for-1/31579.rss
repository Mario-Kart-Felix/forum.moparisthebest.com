    <title>Have you been wishing for a PS3? One special person will get one for $1!</title>

    <description>Dear members,

How are you guys, today? Is the PS3 on your wish list for Christmas? If so, then read on. One guy, On Ouchs, is going to give his PS3 away for $1! He first wanted to make it a $1,000,000 auction, but isn&#39;t that absurd? Who would pay $1,000,000 for a PS3? Anyway, he is going to give the 60 gigabyte PS3 console with two games (Resistance: Fall of Man and Marvel Ultimate Alliance), and an extra wireless controller to one special person. If you are the special person, you will only have to pay $1 and he will ship it to you for free.

To qualify for this, you have to write a letter for Santa on the website www.onedollarplaystation3.com explaining why you should be on the good list. Tens if not hundreds of people will write letters to Santa explaining why they should be on the good list. So write your letter today!
