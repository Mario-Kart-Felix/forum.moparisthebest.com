    <description>Hello, 919han153 here, I&#39;m telling you a whole new way to get your own RuneScape Private Server on your computer!

Look MoparScape is great at making tutorials and guilds for making RSPS&#39;, but what I&#39;m interested in is simpley putting the source / server on your computer, formatting it, fixing any errors, then job done... I am thinking of doing this through remote access to your computer (more information in a bit).

The way I came up with this idea was when I was on my YouTube channel (919han153) and got a load of messages saying: I want to make a runescape private server, with no stress and with ease!  So I talked to them for a bit about my new idea, then we set it up. We both made a remote access accounts, and swapped IPs and stuff. Within 10 minutes it was done; A full 317 formatted with titles, welcome messages, and even had it up online (through Hamachi). 

Some people may be reading this and thinking.. &quot;Its too risky, this guy I met on Moparscape is only a noob&quot; (or something like that =P)  But with this software it allows you to watch / track every move the person makes on your computer, and you can just hit the &quot;esc&quot; key to stop it at any time. Also I am to note that this software is used by computering groups such as Dell and PC World to work with errors to installing the latest windows version from there seats to customers.

Right if you are thinking you want to do this process then I will tell you a bit about the software. Ok first things first, its 100% FREE. As I know of, this is the full package, theres no &quot;pro&quot; version ect. The software is quick and simple; you download the asset of the website then install. Once on you will have your own IP and password, and the box next to it is someone elses (if you have there IP and password, you can send a remote access invite to them, and visa versa). Then when you have connected to some one, (person to you, are you to them) you can view whats going on and stop the process at ANY time.

Right then, if you want a runescape private server downloaded and installed + custom things with it please tell me! Replie at the bottom of the page on MoparScape if you want. Maybe you want to private message me? feel free do it through MorparScape, on 919han153, or YouTube (same name). Or the good old email.. My adress: elijah.sdb@hotmail.co.uk
