<p>Greed? So if someone scams and earns themselves 50$ it’s greed, even though they could work for a day and earn double that? It’s hardly a lot of effort anyway, it took me about 2 days to write the code required whilst everyone else was sat training… In fact, I wrote it whilst training myself whilst other people chatted on MSN or whatever. Most people who play online games like RuneScape tend to have quite a bit of time on their hands believe it or not. I know I did.</p>

<p>Are you really that stupid? You’re acting as if there is no difference between legitimately working for your money and stealing money off of someone else. Why not just auto for the cash instead? Why show you’re a piece of shit and scam someone? I made $1,400 from kib (the guy who hosted Reinet’s IRC server) by selling him mills I made from autoing. Notice how I didn’t have to fuck someone over to accomplish that?</p>

It’s funny how your head’s got messed up of being on computer 24/7. Don’t know why you think “I’m on his dick”, because I’m just pointing out my opinion which happens to be the same as his.

Exactly… It’s not something that a server is missing, it’s that we’ve grown up.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowningae52.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>

Today watched a level 14 approach a level 7 and ask to buy his sword. It was a Iron Short Sword. He offered him 50gp and the other guy said it’s not worth that, he can have it for 30gp… The guy buying the sword said thank-you and they made the exchange. He then asked the player he just bought the sword off if he wants to be his friend and train together. He obliged and off they went…</p>
<p>I haven’t seen that on a private server in 3-4 years of being in the scene.[/quote]<br>
That’s right, RSC has newbies, and good economy, which makes it feel like RSC. I miss my newb days the most in RSC.</p>
