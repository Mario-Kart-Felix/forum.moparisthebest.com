    <description>out of the top 4 servers of all time (RSCD, s+orkPK (SPK), RSCA, RSCE) go from best to last.

[b]Best Community:[/b]

1. RSCD - was a great community, probably because it was invite only, and being the first proper rsc server people were too busy leveling/pking to troll.
2. RSCA - this may be biased due to me spending a large amount of time as admin there but also met some great people
3/4 (TIE) SPK/RSCE - i played little SPK/rsce, but it seemed the hardcore pking faggots were all there and too much QQ/elitism

[b]Best Economy:[/b]

1. RSCD - this economy stayed very strong, and took a long time to actually reach 99 smithing for proper rune to come out (up to 6+ months i believe, it&#39;s amazing how we played for so long without the r2h&#39;s)
2. RSCA/SPK (tie) - decent economy, whilst both very different due to a pvp and pve server, they held up quite well
3. RSCE - honestly, worst economy i have ever seen, don&#39;t know if this was due to some dupes or something but it seemed everyone had hundreds of mills and it didn&#39;t feel right.

that&#39;s my opinion, what&#39;s yours?</description>

Exactly… It’s not something that a server is missing, it’s that we’ve grown up.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
[/quote]<br>
Today watched a level 14 approach a level 7 and ask to buy his sword. It was a Iron Short Sword. He offered him 50gp and the other guy said it’s not worth that, he can have it for 30gp… The guy buying the sword said thank-you and they made the exchange. He then asked the player he just bought the sword off if he wants to be his friend and train together. He obliged and off they went…</p>
<p>I haven’t seen that on a private server in 3-4 years of being in the scene.[/quote]<br>
That’s right, RSC has newbies, and good economy, which makes it feel like RSC. I miss my newb days the most in RSC.</p>

Greed? So if someone scams and earns themselves 50$ it’s greed, even though they could work for a day and earn double that? It’s hardly a lot of effort anyway, it took me about 2 days to write the code required whilst everyone else was sat training… In fact, I wrote it whilst training myself whilst other people chatted on MSN or whatever. Most people who play online games like RuneScape tend to have quite a bit of time on their hands believe it or not. I know I did.[/quote]<br>
Are you really that stupid? You’re acting as if there is no difference between legitimately working for your money and stealing money off of someone else. Why not just auto for the cash instead? Why show you’re a piece of shit and scam someone? I made $1,400 from kib (the guy who hosted Reinet’s IRC server) by selling him mills I made from autoing. Notice how I didn’t have to fuck someone over to accomplish that?</p>

You really are dumb. I think they only time anyone gave Reines anything was for his birthday and that was Kossu’s idea. Yeah, I’m sure the dildo we bought him really helped him out financially. I don’t know how long you think RSCD was even up for or how long subscriptions were even out. The first months of it being invite only was spent on finding bugs and missing/nonworking stuff. Subscriptions didn’t even come out until the last 3 months, and by then he had already invested his own money into upgrading the server. In the end, I think he walked away with less than $2,000. That’s nothing for the amount of time and work he put into creating RSCD.</p>

Reines didn’t need to do anything malicous as he had a community that would happily give him money. Do you really think he spent every penny collected on the OCR software? Do you really think RSCD subscriptions were 100% reinvested? He made thousands upon thousands over the years.[/quote]<br>
You really are dumb. I think they only time anyone gave Reines anything was for his birthday and that was Kossu’s idea. Yeah, I’m sure the dildo we bought him really helped him out financially. I don’t know how long you think RSCD was even up for or how long subscriptions were even out. The first months of it being invite only was spent on finding bugs and missing/nonworking stuff. Subscriptions didn’t even come out until the last 3 months, and by then he had already invested his own money into upgrading the server. In the end, I think he walked away with less than $2,000. That’s nothing for the amount of time and work he put into creating RSCD.</p>

I never infected anyone. I didn’t even scam people personally. As I have explained, I made a referral system for others to hand out the URL and then I’d take a 50/50 cut. It’s no different from scamming in-game saying trade me your item and I’ll dupe it or whatever…[/quote]<br>
I never said you infected anyone. And yes you did scam. Were you taking money from others without their permission and keeping it? Yes. You scammed, no matter how much you try to spin it.</p>

<p>LOL. 9/10 people my ass. You were no different from RaW and all the other low life turds who were so pixel hungry. All you were (and probably still are) is someone who cannot accomplish anything, whatsoever, for himself. You rely on others to gain some asinine thing that won’t help you in the long run.

Geez dude, fucking chill now, it’s only fucking virtual money in a virtual game, that he stole from 12 year old kids that have nolife and are complete dickheads and retarded enough to go on phishing site.</p>

<p>Greed? So if someone scams and earns themselves 50$ it’s greed, even though they could work for a day and earn double that? It’s hardly a lot of effort anyway, it took me about 2 days to write the code required whilst everyone else was sat training… In fact, I wrote it whilst training myself whilst other people chatted on MSN or whatever. Most people who play online games like RuneScape tend to have quite a bit of time on their hands believe it or not. I know I did.</p>

</aside>
<p>Are you really that stupid? You’re acting as if there is no difference between legitimately working for your money and stealing money off of someone else. Why not just auto for the cash instead? Why show you’re a piece of shit and scam someone? I made $1,400 from kib (the guy who hosted Reinet’s IRC server) by selling him mills I made from autoing. Notice how I didn’t have to fuck someone over to accomplish that?</p>

<p>And what he did back then shouldn’t matter now, since it happened 10 years ago. And people that are still flaming him about that are either immature or jealous, they would have done the same if they could, who wouldn’t want pixels that you can sell for lots of $? In the end it’s just a game and people are overreacting, and once again it happened long time ago and doesn’t matter now.</p>

Back then u wouldnt have been as clever as you are now… And you say all those who got hacked? Didnt keylog? If SFU and g0ne remember correctly, you infected Runebot and sold it for next to nothing… Then jumped the accounts and cleared the bank…  It was all over RSCheatnet.  You and darkevil did Destructokil, cause i remember reading his report on rscn and forwarding it to mediator.  Oh well, those days have gone,  shame all thats left is you.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Nope, not me… I’ve never keylogged and Darkevil3k had zero-computer skill. The only thing I did was operate a phishing site (<a href="http://RVNESCAPE.COM" rel="nofollow noopener">RVNESCAPE.COM</a>)[/quote]<br>
Which means you scammed a lot of people, correct?</p>

Kryptix, better known as Luke owns a runescape classic privet server called Runescape Classic Emulation. He is a strange creature, half human half pixel. From a young age he was told by his mother his penis was a birth defect and was forced to tape it between his legs. He used to steal pixels and sell them for self satisfaction. His mission to re-create a runescape classic world is feuled by his burning ambition to prove to himself hes not as worthless as his family or school bullies claimed he was. He is on a mission to reclaim your pixels! Luke is not to be trusted, he is a compulsive liar and a proven pathetic keylogger/scammer. Up yours RSCE!</p>

              <p>xEnt, your server had the best community, most helpful and enjoyable enviroment.  Even from back in RSC days, Luke wasnt liked by any of the realscape players… Him and his little bumboy darkevil3k on their keylogging spree, you could call them the original trolls of RSC.  Kryptix/Kryptik/Luke no doubt has built a huge and highly successful server, however a huge chunk of that community are childish idiots who troll for fun and probaly never played real rsc… Personally i think you should stick to photography.  Always has so much to say, mainly denying things or directing his own opinion as the superior one… I dont see why people want to play a server owned and ran by someone as aragant, ignorant and self obsessed as the mighty script kiddy Kryptix… But thats just my opinion.</p>
