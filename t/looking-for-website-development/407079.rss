    <title>Looking For Website Development</title>

    <description>Hello Moparscape,

Soon I will be wishing to release an economy RSPS Server. I have been coding java for a while now and I have a lot of experience. I want to look for someone who would be able to get a good website for the server. Yes, I know how to make websites and such but I hate doing it and i&#39;m not very good that part of making a server. Just send me a pm if you would like to be a part of the development team!

EDIT: I would really like to find someone that has a V Bulletin license if possible. That would be great!

Thanks!</description>
