    <title>Just want to verify this theory about the com.ms packages</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/just-want-to-verify-this-theory-about-the-com-ms-packages/347006</link>
    <description>Well, so I went to deob a newer 612 client and got it to go through the deob process easily.
But as soon as it deobed and I ran it through ZKM&#39;s renaming tool thing it shat bricks when it came across the com.ms packages, through help from popbob this was linked back to the old Microsoft JVM&#39;s J/Direct, so in theory if you got your hands on an MS JVM with J/Direct and included in the classpath it should work fine.

I am also assuming that this stuff is there for backwards compatibility with the MS JVM so once the client is deobed this can be removed and it wouldn&#39;t matter to anyone not running the MS JVM. It seems like to me all the J/Direct stuff is there for is for people using the MS JVM to be able to play in DX mode.

If I&#39;m on the right track here tell me if I&#39;m not feel free to call me an idiot but please hint me in the right direction.
Also if I&#39;m right and someone has a better solution please do share.</description>

              <p>Yeah that’s true but just examining some more classes it clearly calls the classes from J/Direct.<br>
It’s DX wrappers, it’s user32 wrapper, etc.<br>
I’m pretty sure on that one now I just want to know if there is a better solution than digging up the MS JVM and including J/Direct in the classpath.</p>

I haven’t looked, but my guess would be that the com.ms package has nothing to do with their old jvm whatsoever. It’s most likely just bindings for directx.<br>
[/quote]<br>
How would it be bindings for DirectX if it doesn’t even have them??<br>
And it has bindings for DirectX already in the client jar in the package “jagdx” that’s why I assumed it’s something else.<br>
Also I wouldn’t think MS would write DX bindings for Java cause they don’t support it and use their .NET crap.[/quote]Oh ok, no clue then.</p>
<p>Microsoft would most likely not write bindings, but who’s to stop someone else from doing it? The commonly used java opengl bindings weren’t written by sun (lwjgl, jogl)</p>
