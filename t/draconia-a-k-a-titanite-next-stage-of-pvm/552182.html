I‚Äôve been working for a while on a PvM only server; it was alright but it made me realize that eventually all PvM boiled down to just hitting the other thing and healing when it hits back.<br>
This concept is boring to me, thus I got bored of that kind of PvM (despite there being other tactics involved, obviously).</p>
<p>Thus I began project: Titanite, using the source that my PvM server uses, I started scribbling up an AI system.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What I‚Äôve achieved:</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Intelligence-controlled AI behavior.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Example:</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Our creature will be created (done at the time of spawning) with flags placed upon it:</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-u">"Dragon"</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Intelligence = 90;</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-u">‚ÄúMetal‚Äù</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-u">‚ÄúG-class‚Äù </span> <span class="bbcode-i">(this is just a difficulty system within the content of the server; ranging from unranked which is normal to high, all the way to X-class)</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-u">‚ÄúResistant‚Äù</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-u">‚ÄúArmored‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What comes out of the above?</span><br>
A Metal Dragon (such as mith, rune, steel or iron dragon) which is armored against ranged attacks, resistant to magic and has its health/damage multiplier based on its rank (G-class being 2nd rank, rank 3 is as high as it goes, X-class).<br>
Because of its 90 intelligence (a typical creature would get 10 intelligence), all of the AI modules are enabled.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What happens during the battle?</span><br>
The creature will block attacks, take opportunities to swing heavily at the player when they sense weakness, they will abuse weaknesses (such as low elemental resistances, or pierced armor), they will counter-attack, pin down and even run away when weak‚Ä¶<br>
Not only that, if the creature is consistently placed under status ailments (burning/frozen); it will anger much faster and enrage, dealing very quick and heavy attacks in rapid succession, until it runs out of stamina.</p>
<p>And when the monster is weak, well‚Ä¶ it disappears with a poof‚Ä¶ and then, thanks to the ecology I‚Äôve written into the content, you‚Äôll be able to hunt it down to its nest (unless you haven‚Äôt done your research prior to undertaking this hunt); where it will be sleeping, vulnerable to the first attack that hits it (x4 damage). When sleeping monsters regenerate quickly, thus you have to be fast to find the creature.</p>
<p>And that‚Ä¶ is more like it!</p>
<p><em>Media coming uber soon! I promise!</em></p>
