    <title>Project: RuneScape Remade</title>

    <description>Hello everyone, you may have seen my post in the projects sections.

Anyway, Welcome to Project: RuneScape Remade.

As you probably guessed by the title, it&#39;s a remake. Now, a lot of you are probably saying, ugh not another remake... and I understand. However, now that Vault switched sources and Rs-Reborn is falling to pieces since sinisoul and scully both quit, the two front runners are gone. I want there at least to be one successful remake, because I really enjoyed the &quot;good old days&quot; of RuneScape and someone needs to re-create them. Hopefully that will be us!

You should consider joining this project if you:
Are dedicated and willing to put time and effort in.
You have at-least some knowledge of Java.
You are passionate about old RuneScape, preferable a RuneScape veteran.
You don&#39;t mind doing config tasks such as spawns or monster drops.

Currently it&#39;s just me working on the project, so you will just be interacting with me. 

If you are interested please copy and paste the application forum on the bottom of the page. 

Here&#39;s my latest Image of the project, if you want to learn more go to my project thread:

              <p>Hello everyone, you may have seen my post in the projects sections.</p>
<p>Anyway, Welcome to Project: RuneScape Remade.</p>
<p>As you probably guessed by the title, it’s a remake. Now, a lot of you are probably saying, ugh not another remake… and I understand. However, now that Vault switched sources and Rs-Reborn is falling to pieces since sinisoul and scully both quit, the two front runners are gone. I want there at least to be one successful remake, because I really enjoyed the “good old days” of RuneScape and someone needs to re-create them. Hopefully that will be us!</p>
<p>You should consider joining this project if you:<br>
Are dedicated and willing to put time and effort in.<br>
You have at-least some knowledge of Java.<br>
You are passionate about old RuneScape, preferable a RuneScape veteran.<br>
You don’t mind doing config tasks such as spawns or monster drops.</p>
<p>Currently it’s just me working on the project, so you will just be interacting with me.</p>
<p>If you are interested please copy and paste the application forum on the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Here’s my latest Image of the project, if you want to learn more go to my project thread:<br>
