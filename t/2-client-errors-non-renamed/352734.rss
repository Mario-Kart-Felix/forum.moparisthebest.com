    <title>2 Client Errors. [Non-renamed]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2-client-errors-non-renamed/352734</link>
    <description>This error only occurs when I attack the Npc, also, ignore the T2 error, that was me just messing around. Trying to fix the Npc error on my own. I was thinking, maybe I get this error because the Npc is 508+?

Help, please.

Also, when I talk to my Npc, his model of his face doesn&#39;t show up on the dialogue;

[b]Mine:[/b]
