    <title>HELP! Making a server!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-making-a-server/543819</link>
    <description>Hi everyone!

I am fairly new to the community, and I am looking to operate a Runescape Private server. I downloaded Moparscape 3.2 Aryan and it works well, but I am facing a few problems:

1. Once I promote my character to Moderator status I can&#39;t use any of the commands. ::bank ::pickup nothing works. However if I am a regular player, I can use the commands. 

Can someone give me a newer version that is easy to edit? I am looking for something very basic and easy to use. I know how to port forward and set up the server, but it seems like all the server download links don&#39;t work.

Someone please help!

Thanks!</description>

              <p>Hey Mate, Try looking at the commands for pickup and bank and add permissions for moderators, look at other command that work for moderators and add permissions from them thats What i do if Im stuck. Look at existing code and edit it to fit in. Cant really help without more information post the ::bank command code.</p>

              <p>If i was you, I would use a delta source thats rlly simple so you can make sure everything works. If you want to be a bit more detailed you could use PI (project Insanity, i think), little harder but i found it easier as a beginner just cause it was more organized.</p>
<p>Last if you want to send or post your commands to me, ill take a look and see what going on. Try looking for like if pRights &lt;= 1;<br>
player = 0<br>
mod = 1</p>

</aside>
<p>Uh, MoparScape 3.2 with Aryan is really, really basic.<br>
If not just as basic as Delta, so you literally aren’t helping here.</p>
<p>OP: I suggest learning some of the basic java fundamentals before starting a RSPS.<br>
Also, most have moved away from the base you’re using as there are more quality ones out there, and I honestly suggest not using it. However, you can if you want.<br>
For your command issue,<br>
I’d make sure that the commands are set that they require the same rights as the moderator status, because it sounds like you have it backwards.</p>
