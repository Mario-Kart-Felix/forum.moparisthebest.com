              <p>150? Please at least try to come up with something approaching reality.</p>
<p>Aryan was first released publicly to SourceForge on or around November 7. See this link: <a href="http://aryan.cvs.sourceforge.net/aryan/aryan/run-bot.sh?view=log" rel="nofollow noopener">http://aryan.cvs.sourceforge.net/aryan/aryan/run-bot.sh?view=log</a></p>
<p>We moved from there to the SVN setup on devland maybe a few weeks later.</p>
<p>Assuming 4 updates per month, that’d put Aryan at around 28-30 releases, but that hasn’t been the case. It’s marginally more than that. But not significantly.</p>
<p>The earliest client jar I have is 332, but how closely that corresponds to the beginning of Aryan is beyond me.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Actually, SourceForge tells us the earliest revision, too. Our first update was to <span class="hashtag">#343</span>, so the first public client version available was for 342. <a href="http://aryan.cvs.sourceforge.net/aryan/aryan/OUTPUT/Player.java?view=log" rel="nofollow noopener">http://aryan.cvs.sourceforge.net/aryan/aryan/OUTPUT/Player.java?view=log</a></p>

              <p>Well back in the old kaitnieks days the devs of Aryan came up with Aryan. It was free unlike another client SBot, which you had to pay like 100 bucks for. Everyone literally started autoing, but then one day the devs stopped updating and Jagex had placed their Shiny new detection system in place and like 10,000 people got banned including 5 of my autoers =(</p>
