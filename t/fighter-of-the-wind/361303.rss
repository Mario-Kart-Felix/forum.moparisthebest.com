    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fighter-of-the-wind/361303</link>
    <description>Just took an interest in Kyokushin karate which is basically specializing in 1 hit k0s, so I started watching a few good movies.

&lt;blockquote&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_in_the_Wind
Fighter in the Wind (Korean: 바람의 파이터) is a 2004 South Korean film. It is based on the Japanese comic book Karate Baka Ichidai which is an account of karate competitor Choi Yeung-Eui (최영의, 崔永宜) who went to Japan after World War II to become a fighter pilot but found a very different path instead. He changed his name to Masutatsu Oyama (大山倍達) and went across the country, defeating martial artists one after another. This film concentrates on the period when he is still young, and developing his famous karate style, Kyokushin.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The fighting scenes in this movie are epic, you&#39;d have to watch it and you&#39;ll know ;)</description>
