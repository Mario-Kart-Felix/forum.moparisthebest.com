    <title>Open source HybridScape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/open-source-hybridscape/418036</link>
    <description>For a little while I&#39;ve been playing with older sources &amp; I remembered [b]HybridScape[/b] from a few years ago that came with [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,6915.0.html]Moparscape 3.2[/url] and found that as I briefly remember it&#39;s closed source. I tried using several decompilers but it seems there are some errors.[quote]MISSING MONITORENTER&#39; means that jad found a MONITOREXIT instruction while there was no MONITORENTER to pair up with it. a monitor is a &#39;lock&#39;, used in synchronized () { } blocks to support synchronous code constructs.

edit: bahahahah couldnt help but lol:

[code]/* Woodawg23&#39;s perfect decompiler
 * Coming soon to rune-server
 */[/code]

some idiot nmed woodawg23 used JAD and pretends to have used a custom decompiler ahahah.

anyway the errors in this server are of a more broad scope, for example like ReTT$ReTask.java, which has a class definition the same a ReTT.ReTask causing javac to freak out[/QUOTE]But moparisthebest said that it&#39;s open source in the thread, so I tried downloading another mirror from megaupload and that didn&#39;t allow the player(s) to log in there was some exception.[quote=&quot;moparisthebest&quot;][quote author=dlong link=topic=6915.msg71131#msg71131 date=1153235491]hey how do you edit your game when u got it?? plz tell me becuz i got it.... But theres like not any monsters tell me how to plz!![/quote]check they hybridscape folder, its opensource[/quote]

              <p>No problem, it’s not as easy to get to as I would like.
