    <title>Blackmarks?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/blackmarks/289151</link>
    <description>is black mark possible?
and is there the REAL report system?
that were u report a player it gets the incident and uses as evidence?
and reports the incident to a online mod?
so everytime some1 gets reported for a bad reason only it sends the thingy and gives you blackmarks
and when you log back in i want it to say You have +blackmarks+ Method like how much black marks u have if so aswell how&#39;d do u do that?

oh and also sorry :( Please help me on Range following? at the moment when a players goes to far and it says You are too far to range.
it stops and doesnt follow the player
it should attacks them while following until the player gets to a certain distance like 7 steps away it should stop and still range untill the player gets far away You shud start to follow.


one more thing.. i have put farming into my server kinda delta but is made by me mostly and farmin doesnt work. say if i use the tomato seed on the alleoment (the Flower patch thingy) it doesnt Do it. what can i do? 
Please fix!
