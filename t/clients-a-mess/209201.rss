    <title>Clients; a mess?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/clients-a-mess/209201</link>
    <description>Well I am sick of all the clients that have all the same thing in them over and over again and they are all leeched with the names changed. I&#39;m sure you all are too. This thread is not like the one Telenubby made about suggestions, its about discussion, and since this is the client section I don&#39;t know where else I could put this.

Clients these days are all about 3 things. Items, NPC&#39;s, and sprites. That is not what makes a client guys. Items have nothing to do with it, neither to NPC&#39;s, or sprites. What makes a good client then, you ask? A good client consists of several things.

One thing it has is a stable source, so its not a huge file that lags your whole computer and makes it freeze every 10 seconds when you run it. A laggy client is usual made up of stuffed class8.java&#39;s, class5.java&#39;s, stupid pointless stuff in other class&#39;s like GFX, and pixelgrabbers that aren&#39;t used because you didn&#39;t need them or the base didn&#39;t use it, and other stuff like that.

A good client has small features that are attractive and that make a little difference, but in the long run is a good feature. I don&#39;t mean stuff like &quot;custom items&quot; like ghostly barrows, or poorly recolored armour (lol&#39;d as I typed this because its what I [b][u][i]used[/b] to do). All this stuff is merely attractive to noobs that think its hard to do, when honestly, its the easiest thing in the world and you can&#39;t call it programming(coding).

A good client is made up of things that eventually add up to a unique feature or progress towards a whole new achievement of RSPS Clients. There are people on other websites that I am not going to advertise that have working world select buttons, working music buttons, and more. They have a lot more stuff and accomplishments then we do here. This is the reason I am making this thread.

I am asking you all to please think about what you are doing [b]BEFORE[/b] you download a client that you are going to &quot;code&quot;. Think about whether you are really programming. I guarantee that 90% of the people who release clients here aren&#39;t programming at all.

Please think about your work and what you&#39;ve truly done. I am going to explain how what you do affects the outcome of your client and the responses to your work.

Recoloring an item is the easiest thing to do, next to changing the name of a client. If you recolor an item, you have not programmed at all. You have officially &quot;hardcoded&quot; yourself into an idiot because you think you just made a huge accomplishment. Well you didn&#39;t.

Using tutorials to add &quot;new loading and connection lost&quot; black boxes isn&#39;t programming either. Using a tutorial is basically using someone elses knowledge on how to do something, it does not teach you anything. If you use tons of tutorials and then claim it all as yours or whatever, you are still an idiot.

Changing the background/gameframe/login box or buttons isn&#39;t coding either. That has nothing to do with coding. That is all merely graphics stuff which doesn&#39;t even make a difference in game play either. If you change the gameframe and claim 40% of the work as yours, you sir/m&#39;am, are a moron.

Before I go on any further, I know what some of you are thinking. You are probably saying &quot;what does this guy know? All he does is recolor!&quot;. You are very wrong. Over the past few months I have been examining the way clients work, and truly learning to understand what makes up a client. I have also been studying other languages (programming languages), such as C++ and PHP. It has all been non-private server related, and I am using it to build bigger and better (also legal) things. I suggest that you all do the same.

Some of you may have seen my &quot;client progress&quot; thread. All of you who say &quot;omg thats amazing keep it up!&quot;. It isn&#39;t amazing. It is just changing a few numbers, however not many people know how to even do THIS. This is the reason I made this thread, to encourage all of you to start learning new things about your work, and truly being able to appreciate your work when its finished.

I hope you all get what I am trying to say. That clients are a mess right now. That is my whole point. Please feel free to post your opinion. I recommend you do not cuss or flame or post 1 word replies, as it will most likely result in you being warned/muted/moderated.

To Anthony Cerda. [s]I&#39;m sorry for all disputes we&#39;ve had and arguments. I wish for us to forget all that has happened in the past and look forward to the future. I want to be a friend of yours, and I want you to be a friend of mine. Together we can learn new things, and change our ways, for the better.[/s]

I changed my mind cerda. You&#39;re an arrogant asshole that can barely be called a programmer. You can&#39;t even be called that. You steal peoples work, accuse everybody of leeching and then flame every single thread. Your reply to this thread and other threads will prove my point. I got pics of your first replies too btw. So you can&#39;t fool anybody.

To anybody else who has a fight to pick with me, please do not. Anybody that has picked a fight with me in the past, I hope this thread shined some light in your eyes and made you realize that I do not aim for what you all think I do.</description>

No you didnt. You learned crappy conventions practiced by the idiots before you and then you learned how to (its safe to say) “script”, as you’re simply using things made for you already and then just adding them repeadetly 10-100 times before they start to work because of the unstable structure of wL’s emulator.</p>
<p>I garuntee if you spent the same amount of time reading actual Java tutorials and looking the Sun’s website, you would have learned atleast ten times the amount you did whilst “scripting” RS2 Private Servers.</p>

<p>No. Again, all that does is promote copying and pasting and discouraging the most important factors: originality and creativity. Especially because all you guys do is create “tutorials”, if you can even call them that, that teach NOTHING.[/quote]</p>

maybe you should be focusing on what a joke the current state of private servers are in, Instead of worrying about a client that wasnt broken until fucked with by idiots.<br>

<p>I think rsps’s can teach you alot about java if you take the time to learn how they work. But unfortuantly, most people dont.</p>

<p>I’m going to be completely honest with you, Galkon. You’ve done nothing more then anybody else. I saw you moved some redstones, but that’s easy after reading a re-factored client. You claimed you made that dragon plate model, but that’s the same model as Steven’s(Ownage Plz). He did that almost a year ago, and he was one of the first to add new models; properly that is. He implemented that new dragon plate, which was a year ago. So lets face it Galkon, you’ve progressed as much as everybody else.</p>

<p>And if that guy really made the EXACT SAME platebody, I’ve honestly, swear to god, never even heard of him. And he’s not the FIRST to ever implement a dragon platebody.</p>
<p>You’ve progressed no farther than anybody else either?</p>
<p>The point of this thread was not to flame me. It was to get the point that clients are a hardcoded mess.</p>
<p>The thing is, none of you realize I’ve moved on past doing what I used to. So please stop flaming me.</p>

I saw you moved some redstones, but that’s easy after reading a re-factored client. You claimed you made that dragon plate model, but that’s the same model as Steven’s(Ownage Plz). He did that almost a year ago, and he was one of the first to add new models; properly that is. He implemented that new dragon plate, which was a year ago. So lets face it Galkon, you’ve progressed as much as everybody else.[/quote]But that is not the point of this topic. I suggest you re-read it.</p>

              <p>honestly right. everyone thinks that adding new items are a big deal. how about you develop a way to make custom items, not just taking models from npcs in the game, and adding it as an item.

Ahahahahaha!!! i find it so funny that you post something like this and you’re one of the people doing this to the clients! But i do agree with you! I have had many things leached of me!</p>
<p>Just to inform those who did not know this, i was the 2nd person to add 377 cache to 317 client and first to release a tutorial on it. Those who did not know this, it shows how many people leached of me!<br>
[/quote]Just remember, what you accomplished wasn’t anything big. I dont mean to sound offensive, or snotty, but to me it seems as if you think of yourself as all-that because of it.</p>
<p>Keep it clean. Good point(s), Galkon.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thank you Telenubby. Glad you agreed with me.</p>
<p>And I agree with what you said to xharveyx.</p>
<p>And also, to everybody else, nowhere in this post did I say I was an amazing programmer (coder).</p>

<p>I changed my mind cerda. You’re an arrogant asshole that can barely be called a programmer. You can’t even be called that. You steal peoples work, accuse everybody of leeching and then flame every single thread. Your reply to this thread and other threads will prove my point. I got pics of your first replies too btw. So you can’t fool anybody.[/quote]</p>
<p>I could not agree more with you!</p>
<p>another thing id like to point out about cerda. when i used to play his game (yes i must admit i used to play that sorry excuse for a server) he said once on his forums, when somebody posted about runescape updates:</p>
<blockquote>runescape sucks...</blockquote>
<p>well really… im not sticking up for runescape because i really hated the trade things but his game is not much better. Nobody’s games will EVER beet runescape.</p>
<p>also a few days later he dissed another server… frugoo scape i think… frugoo isnt my favorite but it is better then cerda scape by far.</p>
<p>and with the client leeching and stuff… well all them noobs cant help it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> all they want is “rep” and “rep” to me, means nothing! “wow i got 5 rep for leeching look at me! Im so happy!”</p>
<p>basicaly, what im saying is this: those noobs need to get off their lasy buts and read some java tutorials. I myself, dont read them that much. Most of the time i learn from the coding my server… what easier a way to learn then doing it? But when I have a problem i either</p>
<p>a) read java tutorials until i am absolutely sure ive read everything i can about the subject</p>
<p>b) if all else fails post a topic in help.</p>
<p>which also gets me onto another subject, the help topics. “HELP ME!!!” oh wow, what a descriptive title, and then the post says “how do i make a new item?”. Really, easiest thing ever but anyways… you havent even tried to fix this problem yourself. your like a 3 year old… you cant do anything yourself! Really, if your trying to do this and need help, post the code your trying to manipulate and make it work. and a picture of any errors. that would help lots!</p>
<p>and i agree with the tutorials thing, but well… people need tutorials because you cant learn much without being taugh basic things. If your taught basic math like 2+4=6 then you can see that to solve this question you:</p>
<p>2+6+3-7=</p>
<p>first add 2+6=8+3=11-7=4</p>
<p>but still, use the tutorial once, use it twice. you have the concept. Dont ask for them to do it for you. If you use a tutorial to… idk maybe make a teleport from a command. You will eventually be able to manipulate it to do whatever you want. Example:</p>
<p><code>if (command.equalsIgnoreCase("rules"))
         {
rulesMenu();
}</code></p>
<p>you will, by just going through a tutorial once, learn to make more menus, widen the extent of your abilities.</p>
<p>So dont just ask for someone to do it for you.</p>
<p>Well what i said there probably didnt make much sense but thats your problem eh? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Just to inform those who did not know this, i was the 2nd person to add 377 cache to 317 client and first to release a tutorial on it. Those who did not know this, it shows how many people leached of me![/quote]Just remember, what you accomplished wasn’t anything big. I dont mean to sound offensive, or snotty, but to me it seems as if you think of yourself as all-that because of it.</p>
<p>Keep it clean. Good point(s), Galkon.</p>
