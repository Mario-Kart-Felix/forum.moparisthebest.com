    <description>So i herd it has hallucinogen effects?

I took two table spoons a few hours ago, I&#39;ve been fucking around with it since Tuesday, still yet to feel anything. Anyone else had a good experience with it as a drug? I could hardly keep it down, I gag like fuck when I try to swallow it.</description>

              <p>Yeah, but get the stuff in the first link (the chunks of leaves/stems). That’s similar to what I have, but be SURE you pick only the leaves out and smoke them. They burn better and taste better, the stems are HARSH on your lungs, do NOT try smoking them.</p>
<p>Keep in mind the “high” from passion flower is very subtle and mellow, it’s not even remotely intense. I just smoke it because it makes a decent weed alternative.</p>

              <p>Try smoking passion flower (can get it at any common herb store, like Vitamin Cottage). I’ve been smoking it because I’m on UA’s, and frankly, I can’t handle salvia extracts and the affects with anything &lt; 5x are too short-lived. I wouldn’t call passion flower intense (it’s actually very mild, about the same as shitty weed), but it’s highly unique. The high in some ways reminds me of weed, but it’s just…different, I can’t describe it.</p>
<p>Also there really isn’t a comedown, just at some point you notice that you’re no longer high. I prefer this because when I’m high on weed I always worry about whether I’m as high as I was earlier etc.</p>
<p>But as far as nutmeg is concerned, put it away. You’re wasting your time.</p>

<p>You should grind up the nutmeg in water, drink it, then drink more water to help it down, should kick in after around 8 hours.</p>

              <p>If you’re looking for a few homemade highs, than here’s a few options(but not suggestions).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">First stop:</span></p>
<p>Check out your medicine cabinet. Google each <span class="bbcode-i">prescribed</span> medicine(better yet, the active ingredients) of everything you find in your cabinet.</p>
<p>Often wikipedia articles are close to the top. Check them out, look in the contents to see if theres a section about recreation, abuse, or other uses. Read up on it then.</p>
<p>Another way is by finding it on erowid. <a href="http://erowid.org/psychoactives/psychoactives.shtml" rel="nofollow noopener">http://erowid.org/psychoactives/psychoactives.shtml</a> – Click on the Pharmaceuticals drop down menu and browse for the drugs you have. Most uncommon drugs wont have much info in their erowid vault, but read the experiences(When you click on a drug and go to the vault, scroll down a bit and look for “more experiences” or something similar. Check out all the first time experiences to get a good idea on dose and what to expect).</p>
<p>Now, if you care about your body, make sure to read what effects the drug may have on you. Chances are, it’s not great lol.</p>
<p>That can be a pain if you have a lot, and none that get you high. If your parents take any medications for anxiety(perhaps xanax, valium, ativan), if they take strong pain killers(opiates such as codeine, vicoden, oxycontin, etc) and/or if any siblings or yourself take anything for ADD/ADHD, such as Ritalin(Heard its good snorted :P), Dexedrine, or Desoxyn, than you probably have a lot to work with. Just make sure you study up the recreational doses and effects(high and health-wise).</p>
<p>Now, you may also find an OTC medication in your cabinet, which brings us to:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Stop 2: DXM</span></p>
<p>DXM. Maaaaaan I hate that shit, but it was pretty fun back then. Ok this is probably one of the easiest ways for you to go get high, and for the most part, an enjoyable high. At a beginner dose, it feels somewhat similar to being drunk and stoned. At higher doses, impossible for me to explain.</p>
<p>Basically what you want is either a cough syrup, pill, or lozenge containing DXM. I think you’ll find this is quite easy. DXM is probably the most common ingredient in cough syrups. You should be able to get it right off the shelf, although many stores these days are not selling to minors. I’ve had no problems with the Walmart in Canada, or Shoppers Drug Mart. Check this out to find some syrups with it: <a href="http://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/dxm_info2.shtml" rel="nofollow noopener">http://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/dxm_info2.shtml</a></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, it’s important to research drugs before doing them. Well because we are dealing with taking medications 10-50 times the recommended dose, you must research your ass off and make sure you understand this very simple concept: The syrups, pills, etc <span class="bbcode-b">MUST</span> only contain DXM in their active ingredients. The bottle will either have a list of “active ingredients” or “medical ingredients.” You must make sure that it is only dxm. The non-active ingredients are fine, but could be responsible for side effects like nausea and diarrhea.</p>
<p>Depending on the brand, the ingredient will be listed differently. Some examples are DXM HBr, Dextromethorphan HBr, or Dextromethorphan Hybromide.</p>
<p>Short and sweet: Go to your pharmacy, and look for cough syrups with this. Make sure to research it as much as you can, read everything on erowid about it. I recommend a dose of 250 mg’s for the first time(or if you want to be reeeeeeally careful, do like 100 mg’s to make sure you’re not allergic, then up your dose another 200 mg’s an hour or two later). And yes, this means you’re probably going to have to chug syrup. Believe it or not, it’s a lot easier then it sounds(but it gets harder everytime).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Stop 3: Huffing</span></p>
<p>Huffing is gay, gtfo.</p>
<p>Sorry if I don’t make sense, I just rambled on everything that came to mind.</p>

<p>You’re even better off just not to touch the damn stuff. Horrible for your liver, and for 90% of people, a horrible experience. In my very early drug use, I tried nutmeg and I don’t even remember if I got high or not. I remember getting sick though, painfully sick.</p>

              <p>Horrible idea. If you’re going to do it, at least put it in capsules to help with the nausea. Although even then the nausea will still be quite intense.</p>
<p>A few hours after it kicks in it will get overwhelmingly intense (not in the “trip” way, more like a dizzy-sucks-to-be-you sort of way). After it gets too intense and you’re sick of it, you’re still coming up and getting higher, and higher…and then higher. I highly recommend you don’t do it, find some shrooms or something.</p>
