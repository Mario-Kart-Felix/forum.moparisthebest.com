Once you are teliported to the field you have to pick which team you want to go on. Once your on a team you can crouch [Or sneak] to toggle which inventory you have for the battle. 

There are 2 ways to win a War game. Kill your opposing team members until there life pool has run out [the set amount of times the team as a hole can die] OR by scoring points. You can score points by claiming a landmark [Obsidian platform with hole{place your teams wool in it to claim}] or by capturing the other teams flag and returning to your flag or your base. If the other team has your flag and you have thiers, you must kill the person holding your teams flag in order to score the point.
