    <title>Weed Class B</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/weed-class-b/258613</link>
    <description>so wth is this all about. New changes in UK drug law have made cannabis a class B. Not just skunk, the entire drug. I think this is completely illogical on behalf on the government. what are the implications going to be? will weed get more expensive, or harder to get hold of? 
ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS</description>

              <p>its a proven fact that it can make u go fucked in the head, especially if its hash not weed, i also know people who have smoked all there lifes and some, not all, just liek not all smokers have lung cancer, are ‘‘slow’’ and one has all sorts of issues<br>
It doesnt matter what your job is it can hit you at anytime, like my freind knew a 80 year old who smoked 20 a day sine she was 14 and she died of natural courses… its the same basic princaple</p>

<p>That’s bullshit, sorry. It’s possible, if you have a pre-existing mental disorder it could get worse.</p>
<p>I know teachers, lawyers, police officers, successful real-estate agents, etc that have been smoking weed since they were kids. All of them are at least 45-60 years old. They have nothing wrong with them.</p>

<p>Also some people smoke weed because it is illegal, if they made it legal people would be after harder drugs to make them look ‘cool’…</p>
<p>I personally think it should be avalible easier… but they should have a way of making you only have like 1 joint a day or something… That however is imposible, also like i said before people would just go onto harder drugs…</p>
