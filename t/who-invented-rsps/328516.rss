    <title>Who invented RSPS?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/who-invented-rsps/328516</link>
    <description>I was wondering who invented RuneScape Private servers and who started the first RSPS. And like how did he get his hands on the source of RuneScape. Just being curious :D Oh and also when did this happen? Try to answer as many questions as possible, thank you.</description>

<p>Just look at it this way, from a more simplified view; suppose the client would run the following login function:</p>
<p><code>
public void login() {
    ..writeByte(14);
    if (..readByte() != 1) {
        return;
    }
}</code>From this block of code you can infer that if the server writes anything but ‘1’ in response to the login opcode, it is refusing a new connection from initializing. Obviously it was much more complex than this, but the concept remains the same for any game.</p>

</aside>
<p>WinterLove was the first Private-Server created, public one. The guy’s name was winterlove too, lol.<br>
The original reason for the server was to test how bots would work on it so then they could use the bot for real Runescape.</p>
<p>Here is a tree that I saw Graham post of how servers came out in the order:</p>
<p><img src="http://img440.imageshack.us/img440/9421/treek.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Btw - This tree might misguide you, keep in note that pimpscape is not one of the latest releases, it was one of the old ones, and emulous is a new release, not an old one.</p>
<p>More on the history from blakeman8192:</p>
<p>[quote]late 2005/early 2006: kaitnieks was an active and thriving cheating community for runescape<br>
same era: wL made his first server in order to test bots and learn about the protocol. it was single player and horribly coded<br>
early 2006: daiki takes wL’s source and makes it multiplayer, still a “proof of concept” with maybe a bit of support/interest for actually playing it, releases it under the name “blakescape d boosted”<br>
same era: kaitnieks shuts down<br>
soon after: mitb forms for the refugees of the death of kaitnieks, runescape cheating becomes centralized once more<br>
soon after that: development continues by random individuals on the opensource blakescape server and interest increases in hosting/playing servers<br>
soon after that (mid-2006): mitb separates itself from private servers by creating mscp<br>
late 2006: google comes out<br>
2007: mscp is booming with thousands of people<br>
2007+: mscp/mitb are slowly dying (still) as cheating and emulation become decentralized, while content development is made by hundreds of amateur programmers</p>
<p>some history of significant server releases (in chronological order):<br>
winterlove (first release)<br>
blakescape (multiplayer)<br>
mythscape (some early content)<br>
cheezscape (combat, npcs, etc)<br>
whitescape (improved content)<br>
p16 (even more improved content)<br>
rs2dv (entire new release)<br>
hyperion (first commercial scale performance release)<br>
[/quote][/quote]</p>
<p>That’s a great flow chart, thanks for posting it, rep++.</p>
