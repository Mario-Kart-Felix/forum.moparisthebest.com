    <title>What features would YOU like to see in a text-based game?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-features-would-you-like-to-see-in-a-text-based-game/386740</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve seen many text-based RPGs being made but I don&#39;t see anyone asking what the users would like to see in the game (Or I may have missed it, please correct me if I have.).

So I thought it&#39;s time to ask what features would you like to see in a text-based game? For example; What skills would you like to see? What type of story line? Ect.

I am also thinking of writing one myself as I have a couple of bases on my computer anyway. Thanks in advance for your contributions, (if you do contribute  :| )</description>

              <p>Turn based combat , enemies adjusting to the area you are in , passive actions in combat ( dont end your turn ) and active actions ( ending your turn ) , an automatic resource income ( like Miscellenia in RS , it gets resources for you whilst you do close to nothing )</p>
