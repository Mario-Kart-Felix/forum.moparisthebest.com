    <title>Would this be legal?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/would-this-be-legal/398221</link>
    <description>Hi!
So I just got done playing the real rsc. I was interested on how it works. Would it be legal for me to download, for example, rsc if I simply do it to see how it works and not distribute it, steal it or use it in any of my really projects. I did some research and it sounds like the Rsc client was reverse engineered legally. This seems just as innocent as a chef going to a restaurant to buy a item to see how it was made without selling it or using it in his own recipes.

I&#39;m not asking if i&#39;d get caught, I&#39;m simply asking if it&#39;s legal under US laws

Thanks in advance  ;D</description>

              <p>Agreed. It certainly isn’t illegal and theirs no reason to worry that you’d get caught since it is. Although making your server public may be a different story even if you don’t make money.</p>

<p>I was not thinking about decompiling the client. I was simply thinking about using a pre decompiled. Do you think this would still be legal? I did agree to the TOS but I guess I have heard too that legal agreements can be instated for minors. I would also be using it for the purposes listed in my original post.</p>

              <p>Not really. It all depends. For example if a minor (under the age of 18) signed the contract (tos) the minor was not legally binded by the contract. Thats out of the way. (even if the person was 18 the reverse engineering in this case would be legal under us laws)</p>
<p>As for the circumventing copyright protection goes its protected by what I stated early. Now it gets very grey area when you distribute the client, make money from it (possibly even from donation?) or emulates the server to others.</p>
<p>Their a few parts of runescape that are under copyright. The name, skill icons, website shit and 2 recent versions of the client and what not.</p>
<p>The EULA  and the IP that was attempted to be protected under it(in this case of legal reverse engineering) invalid<br>
The circumventing (this was not even commited by rsl33t) Unless of course he did it himself (protected by what whas stated earlier): invalid</p>
<p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:6, topic:398221”]Where did he say he had agreed to and was bound by jagex’s TOS?  I’m sure RSC is similar to RS2, in that you can just grab the runescape client from <a href="http://world1.runescape.com/runescape.jar" rel="nofollow noopener">world1.runescape.com/runescape.jar</a>, without agreeing to anything.</p>
<p>Not to mention that just because something is against jagex’s TOS doesn’t mean it is against the law.[/quote]<br>
True, but it sounds like he played the official one at one point and bought a sub card to play rsc (unless he tried it on a friends)</p>
<p>Either way under 18 it wouldn’t be covered as the contract wasn’t valid<br>
Now if he was over 18 it sounds like he US see’s it as a contract, but the reverse engineering would be legal and it abides by the contract.</p>

              <p>I don’t know. When you agreed to the RSC Terms and Conditions you agreed not to reverse engineer it. I found this on wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowers_v._Baystate_Technologies" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowers_v._Baystate_Technologies</a> . I guess in that Case it was a EULA. I’m not sure I don’t think you are bound by a legal agreement when you agreed to the RSC T&amp;C. The only right they would have is to ban your rsc account.</p>
<p>I think their is a difference between a EULA and T&amp;C. With the terms and conditions you didn’t buy a service. You are simply using it. With a EULA you did buy a service/good. It doesn’t seem that you would be legally bound by a T&amp;C.</p>
<p>Edit: I checked the RS T&amp;C. Here’s what I was talking about:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-i">Our rights<br>
If, acting reasonably, we consider that our Terms and Conditions have or may have been breached, or that there has been fraudulent, unlawful or abusive activity, or that it is necessary in order to prevent or stop any harm or damage to us, to any Jagex Product, to other players or the general public, we may Stop (as defined above) any or all accounts of Jagex Products which we think are connected with the offender subject to such right of appeal as is specified on our website and/or restrict access to or delete virtual currency or anything acquired by means of virtual currency. Such actions may result in loss of membership credit and/or loss of real money paid as part of any item / account trading or other prohibited transaction.</span></span></p>
<p>(In other words breaking the contract gives them the right to delete your account, which is a risk of you using easyrsc or any other rsc emu)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-i">You must not reverse-engineer, decompile or modify any Jagex Product client software in any way <span class="bbcode-b">(except to the extent allowed by applicable law)</span>.</span> </span></p>
<p>Now this is the worrying part. Was the the original rscd client legally obtained. I believe the team did circumvent copyright protection but…)</p>
<p><a>u</a> Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(1)(A), a person who has lawfully obtained the right to use a copy of a computer program may circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a particular portion of that program for the sole purpose of identifying and analyzing those elements of the program that are necessary to achieve interoperability[/u]</p>
<p>(This is from wikipedia. The rsc client was legally obtained. (downloaded from jagex) And this makes me believe it was legal for them to deobbed it)</p>
<p>It seems legal for you to use easyrsc (which i recommend because sql is a mess)  unless anyone else could find a reason it wasn’t otherwise?</p>
