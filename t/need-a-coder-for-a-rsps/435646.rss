    <title>Need a coder for a RSPS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-coder-for-a-rsps/435646</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

Am hiring a coder to work with my current coder or solo up to you to create me a RSPS.

Am looking to create a RSPS one which I will be aiming to make a great success, in order to achieve my goals I am going to need an exceptional coder.

I&#39;ll be wanting to see evidence of your past work.

This will obviously be a full time commitment, I&#39;ll be looking to turning this into a successful server for the joy and the income reward.

Things I want the server mainly based on:

PVP based mixed with a bit of PVM
A lot of donator benefits
Donator shop
Multiple different donator status&#39;s
Vote point shop

I have a forum/graphic designer awaiting.

I&#39;ll be paying for the Dedi , all advertisement fee&#39;s and anything else that will need to be paid for.

I understand there&#39;s a lot of RSPS&#39;S already out there which is why Iv&#39;e set a budget of $1,000 to start this project off.

Am only looking for an exceptional coder who will be dedicated to the project.

DON&#39;T JUST GET HOLD OF ME BECAUSE YOU WANT SOME CASH, YOU MUST BE AN EXCEPTIONAL CODER.

Payment will be discussed in private.

For more information add me on skype &quot;tom.popplestone&quot; letme your from here.

Thanks,

Tom.</description>
