    <title>Need a coder for a RSPS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-coder-for-a-rsps/435608</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

Am hiring a coder to create me a RSPS.

Am looking to run a RSPS one of which I will be aiming to make a great success, in order to achieve my goals I am going to need an exceptional coder.

I&#39;ll be wanting to see evidence of your past work.

This will obviously be a full time commitment, I&#39;ll be looking to turning this into a successful server for the joy and the financial gain.

I have a forum/graphic designer awaiting.

I&#39;ll be paying for the Dedi , all advertisement fee&#39;s and anything else that will need to be paid for.

I understand there&#39;s a lot of RSPS&#39;S already out there which is why Iv&#39;e set a budget of $1,000 to start this project off.

Am only looking for an exceptional coder who will be dedicated to the project and someone I will hopefully be able to build a good working relationship with.

We will discuss which source will be best in private as well as payment.  

For more information pm me.

Thanks,

Tom.</description>
