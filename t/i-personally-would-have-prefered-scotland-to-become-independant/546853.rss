Are you stupid? Scotland made a good decision to stay with us. They’d have a lot of trouble finding a new currency if they left, also, they’ll find many other problems if they left.<br>
[/quote]<br>
You are a fudgeing idiot. How can you even possibly say we’d have a problem finding a currency? The English would have to accept a currency union to avoid huge costs of cross border trade and transaction fees. The only reason they would decline would be the Tory government being their usual fudgeing spiteful self.</p>
<p>We have 800 thousand people living in fudgeing poverty because of fudgeing idiots like you who know fudgeing nothing and think they understand the meaning of independence. This isn’t a fudgeing nationalist choice, this is a fudgeing necessity. It’s not for me to see the benefit it’s for my children, and their children. I don’t want to see them using a fudgeing foodbank because they have to pay for healthcare or have to pay for education all because of a fudgeing idiotic westminster government doing what fudgeing suits it best.</p>
<p>Scotland has a huge wealth potential and the fact that there’s people like my family who (before I had a good paid job) were on the fudgeing breadline week on top of week. We always had enough to get by, but barely. We don’t have to fudgeing live like that. We don’t have to have nukes in our water, we don’t have to have the oil below those nukes. We don’t have to be fudgeing slaves anymore.</p>
<p>We didn’t vote in a government that favours the rich and wealthy and fudges the working class right over, fudgeing goons like you did.</p>
<p>Do not fudgeing comment on independence for a country you don’t give a fudge about but by christ you lot would struggle without us, not the other fudgeing way around.</p>
<p>No voters have potentially ruined millions of futures, and people just brush it off as though it’s nothing. The only choice for Scotland was to go further as a nation of solidarity rather than this mess we have.</p>
<p>“You’ll get more powers” 60 Tory MPs already denying it and Labour are on the fence of removing their support to devolve further powers.</p>
<p>If I see another fudgeing misinformed fudgeing comment in this fudgeing thread so help me god it’ll be a fudgeing blood bath.</p>
<p>You can shove your union up your fudgeing arse. We will have independence, we need it to keep our fudgeing families afloat. We’re meant to be a nation of brave people, what I seen yesterday was a fudgeing bunch of 2 million girls scared into voting no by media and sheer scaremongering. 1.6 million people don’t keep quiet, Yes lost the battle, but it’s winning the war. Mark my fudgeing words we’ll have our day.[/quote]<br>

<p>Scotland trades with other businesses in and out of the UK the same, except it’s easier to do businesses with the other 92% of the population of the UK if you’re within the same sovereign nation.</p>
<p>Scotland’s largest trading ‘partner’:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rest of the UK @ £47bn a year</li>
<li>USA @ £3.5bn</li>
</ol>
<p>They’re absolutely free to trade with anyone else, it’s just easier to do so in local markets. It’s also part of the argument against independence, if Scotland went independent, the rest of the UK could make trading with the rest of the UK more difficult, given Scotland relatively small size, it’d hurt Scotland a heck of a lot more than the rest of the UK. 47bn is a lot of money… for Scotland… it’s not all that much for the UK.</p>

<p>England has natural advantages in that it is 85% of the economy, 83.9% of the population - and therefore there are measures in place to ensure Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland stimulated and that means they do they get a better deal in many regards in comparison to English citizens.</p>
<p>Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs can vote on issues that only affect England, but English MPs cannot vote in the Scottish Parliament or the Welsh or Northern Irish Assembly. I think there should be some input from Scotland, Wales, NI on certain things that England does, purely because it is so big and there is potential for some things to be enacted that would harm the other countries in the union, but there are many things that should be only voted on by English MPs.</p>
<p>I’ll give the SNP credit in that they refuse to vote on English matters in the UK parliament though.</p>

              <p>Ruby: Brought to you by The Daily Mail and Nationalist political parties</p>
<p>It’s adorable how some Scottish people believe their small country of <span class="bbcode-b">4.4m (8.3% of UK population)</span>, <span class="bbcode-b">7.7% of the UK economy</span>, has “England mooching” off them. Even including oil revenues, the Scottish economy is tiny. Beside the obviously massive difference in economy size, have you ever heard of the Barnett formula?</p>
<p>It guarantees that from that one pot of money that England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland pay into, that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland get have their public expenditure automatically adjusted to any changes in England to ensure it remains higher. It wasn’t the intention (iirc), but it ensures it happens like this either way.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/st1v60z.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Scotland has its own parliament, Wales has the Welsh assembly, Northern Ireland has the Northern Irish Assembly. England has none of those things. Scotland believes it is more important than it actually is, I guess it’s easier to blame the bigger more important country for reasons why that isn’t true.</p>
<p>As for the comparisons between colonies going independent from the United Kingdom - it’s a really dumb comparison. <span class="bbcode-b">Scotland created the United Kingdom with England</span>. Scotland entered a voluntary, mutal partnership to create the United Kingdom. All those other countries had no choice, they were colonies - this wasn’t. Scotland was and is the ‘United Kingdom’ (or Union of Great Britain until a certain date) that all those countries declared independence from.</p>
<p>I’m glad the referendum is over, so we can stop giving that tiny country up north disproportionate attention compared to the rest of the UK.</p>

<p>Ah, I just quoted what my teacher told me, go complain to her for giving her wisdom words to me which turned out to be absolute shit! Also we don’t pay for healthcare, there’s a free healthcare service called the NHS (National Health Service)<br>
[/quote]<br>
The NHS is being privatised kiddo, open your fudgeing eyes and read the shit that your BBC is spraying all over your fudgeing TV. The NHS won’t be free much longer. One of the many reasons I wanted independence from you fudgeing goons.[/quote]</p>
<p>The Scottish parliament manage the NHS in Scotland. If it is being privatised in Scotland, it is because of your beloved SNP are deciding to make the same cuts England is. Parts of the NHS are under threat of privatisation in England (which your Scottish MPs can vote on).</p>
<p>The whole of the UK is going under public spending cuts, but its up to the Scottish parliament where and how they make those cuts, if they decide to do so by privatising parts of the NHS in Scotland, then that’s nothing to do with the UK government.</p>

Ah, I just quoted what my teacher told me, go complain to her for giving her wisdom words to me which turned out to be absolute shit! Also we don’t pay for healthcare, there’s a free healthcare service called the NHS (National Health Service)[/quote]<br>
The NHS is being privatised kiddo, open your fucking eyes and read the shit that your BBC is spraying all over your fucking TV. The NHS won’t be free much longer. One of the many reasons I wanted independence from you fucking goons.</p>

Are you stupid? Scotland made a good decision to stay with us. They’d have a lot of trouble finding a new currency if they left, also, they’ll find many other problems if they left.<br>
