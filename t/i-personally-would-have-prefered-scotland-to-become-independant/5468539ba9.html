<p>Scotland trades with other businesses in and out of the UK the same, except it’s easier to do businesses with the other 92% of the population of the UK if you’re within the same sovereign nation.</p>
<p>Scotland’s largest trading ‘partner’:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rest of the UK @ £47bn a year</li>
<li>USA @ £3.5bn</li>
</ol>
<p>They’re absolutely free to trade with anyone else, it’s just easier to do so in local markets. It’s also part of the argument against independence, if Scotland went independent, the rest of the UK could make trading with the rest of the UK more difficult, given Scotland relatively small size, it’d hurt Scotland a heck of a lot more than the rest of the UK. 47bn is a lot of money… for Scotland… it’s not all that much for the UK.</p>

        <p>It’s too bad that Scotland didn’t get independence, it’d be interesting to see how they would continue to defend non-free university for English students when no other EU country seems to have a problem of people hopping borders for cheaper/free university.</p>

Are you stupid? Scotland made a good decision to stay with us. They’d have a lot of trouble finding a new currency if they left, also, they’ll find many other problems if they left.<br>
[/quote]<br>
You are a fudgeing idiot. How can you even possibly say we’d have a problem finding a currency? The English would have to accept a currency union to avoid huge costs of cross border trade and transaction fees. The only reason they would decline would be the Tory government being their usual fudgeing spiteful self.</p>
<p>We have 800 thousand people living in fudgeing poverty because of fudgeing idiots like you who know fudgeing nothing and think they understand the meaning of independence. This isn’t a fudgeing nationalist choice, this is a fudgeing necessity. It’s not for me to see the benefit it’s for my children, and their children. I don’t want to see them using a fudgeing foodbank because they have to pay for healthcare or have to pay for education all because of a fudgeing idiotic westminster government doing what fudgeing suits it best.</p>
<p>Scotland has a huge wealth potential and the fact that there’s people like my family who (before I had a good paid job) were on the fudgeing breadline week on top of week. We always had enough to get by, but barely. We don’t have to fudgeing live like that. We don’t have to have nukes in our water, we don’t have to have the oil below those nukes. We don’t have to be fudgeing slaves anymore.</p>
<p>We didn’t vote in a government that favours the rich and wealthy and fudges the working class right over, fudgeing goons like you did.</p>
<p>Do not fudgeing comment on independence for a country you don’t give a fudge about but by christ you lot would struggle without us, not the other fudgeing way around.</p>
<p>No voters have potentially ruined millions of futures, and people just brush it off as though it’s nothing. The only choice for Scotland was to go further as a nation of solidarity rather than this mess we have.</p>
<p>“You’ll get more powers” 60 Tory MPs already denying it and Labour are on the fence of removing their support to devolve further powers.</p>
<p>If I see another fudgeing misinformed fudgeing comment in this fudgeing thread so help me god it’ll be a fudgeing blood bath.</p>
<p>You can shove your union up your fudgeing arse. We will have independence, we need it to keep our fudgeing families afloat. We’re meant to be a nation of brave people, what I seen yesterday was a fudgeing bunch of 2 million girls scared into voting no by media and sheer scaremongering. 1.6 million people don’t keep quiet, Yes lost the battle, but it’s winning the war. Mark my fudgeing words we’ll have our day.[/quote]<br>
