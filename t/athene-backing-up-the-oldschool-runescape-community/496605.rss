              <p>Guy seems really nice, I’ve seen a lot of video makers that I would have never though played RuneScape supporting the servers lately. Even the Yogs Cast members have been reaching out to get support for it.</p>

Gosh, I hate him. Arrogant dude that thinks he the most kindest and best gamer on earth. Sure, he is kind because it seems like he livestreams for charity but best gamer? uh, even if he was. You dont talk about it… Just… No…</p>
<p>And now he is just boring, he was funny when he made videos with furious. Not anymore.</p>
<p>OT: This was kind of him, I agree. But it doesnt change the fact that he is annoying and arrogant.<br>

You don’t realise he only acts like that because his viewers enjoy it, and he’s only trolling right[/quote]</p>
<p>Not so sure about that, I watched a video when he claimed to be the best Ryze in the world… ugh, arrogant is the word. And the reason why the LoL community hates him is just because of his arrogance. So if he is acting it, its just stupid.</p>
