Hello! If those pictures didn&#39;t pull you in, then.. I might understand. XD To be honest I really suggest you come and just make a account and test out the server. 


Colossus will be something different than an other server. I know everyone says that, but here is what I&#39;m telling you, Colossus will be ran by the players; In the sense that I code my own server, and I&#39;m IRL with all the admins. That leaves no room for error in the administration, I&#39;ll be taking polls and listening to every player that puts time into make this server one of the best in all Private Servers.. I hope you will be among those players. 





EDIT: 
I&#39;ve started dungeoneering and rewards. 
Dominion tower and rewards. 
I&#39;ve perfected Nex. 
Added the four stages to QBD, 
Finished up a notice board, 
Made the most legit Donor Zone Ive ever seen :) 
Fixed Agility and herblore, 
Fixed Mining and smithing 
Fixed the Summoning scrolls bug. 
Made Jad 63 Waves, 
That is just the tip of the Ice Burg, 
Added a few items as well, Working on Drygores as we speak. 
Its coming along, But I&#39;m focusing on a good fundamental game before I go crazy. 
SO MUCH MORE, I&#39;ll be uploading more pictures later through the day ;)</description>
