    <description>Hello everyone, now this may seem stupid to most of you, so I would like to take this oppurtunity to ask you to please not insult me.
I&#39;m trying to re-colour a weapon on Metasquoia. I can&#39;t seem to get any of the .dat files into it.
I click open, then search in the RSMV file I have, it doesn&#39;t show any of the .dats
and I haven&#39;t a clue how to import them.
I was thinking of changing it to.mqo, but I don&#39;t want to mess up.
Could anyone please try to help and tell me if it&#39;s wrong to change it to .mqo? :confused:</description>
