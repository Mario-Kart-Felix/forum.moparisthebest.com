    <title>Connecting problems - How to join, what you need</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connecting-problems-how-to-join-what-you-need/90895</link>
    <description>Hi, my friend wants to be able to join my server, but he&#39;s having problems trying to log in. Just a few questions I&#39;d like answered :)

My internet connection is through a proxy, and not directly connected to the internet. Although I can still play the normal Runescape.

1. I have Hamachi, with a network. What do I need to do server-side to help him join?

2. Does he need Hamachi to join? 

3. Should he add in my network name that shows on the Hamachi page in the IP (along with .no-ip.org)?

4. Is there anything I must do in order to make my server joinable?

Any help at all please!</description>
