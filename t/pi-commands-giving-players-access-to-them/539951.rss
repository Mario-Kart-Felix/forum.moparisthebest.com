    <title>[PI] Commands, giving players access to them?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-commands-giving-players-access-to-them/539951</link>
    <description>I&#39;m sorry for all the text, I can never word things right.

I don&#39;t normally come for help here, or in general because I like to figure things out myself. But Right now I can&#39;t even seem to figure out how to start implementing this idea.

Basically, I have the standard PI commands.java, I haven&#39;t implemented anything better because, well just because I don&#39;t see it needed right now.

However, I want to make it possible for me, as the owner, to give anyone access to specific commands at any moment in-game.

Why is this requiring help, you ask. Well simple. If you&#39;ve ever seen how it&#39;s currently handled, the only way to give access would be to assign new player rights.
Example:
[code=java]
		if (c.playerRights &gt;= 0)
			playerCommands(c, playerCommand);
		if (c.playerRights &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp;  c.playerRights &lt;= 3)
			moderatorCommands(c, playerCommand);
		if (c.playerRights == 2 || c.playerRights == 3)
			administratorCommands(c, playerCommand);
		if (c.playerRights == 3)
			ownerCommands(c, playerCommand);
[/code]
Like I said, I&#39;ve never seen fit to change this system. But as you can tell, only specific rights have access to specific commands.
I want to [u]scrap that system[/u] and change how commands are accessed. The issue? I don&#39;t know how.

I want to have one &quot;master&quot; command that can grant access to specific commands for each player.
Like, lets say I have a command called ::kick and I want to give it to a player who is an undercover staff.
I&#39;d want to do something like ::givekick playerName, and then they suddenly have access to ::kick but they never changed player rights.

I was thinking an array of booleans, like &quot;public boolean[] hasAccessToCommand = new boolean[100];

However, that would be clunky as hell and I&#39;d have to make a getter\setter for the default commands for each player right (I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;d have to do this regardless).

So guys, what can I do to solve this?

Here&#39;s what I want (to recap):
Rights-based commands (by default). If you have the rights, you can do the command.
A master command to give players access to any specific command and only that one (Only the &quot;owner&quot; can do this).

I remember seeing something like this in a project rainbow release, but I&#39;ve never looked at the code on how they implemented this.</description>

Hashmap, command to String[] of player names? Then add and delete from it as you like.<br>

Are you saying a hashmap like:<br>
HashMap(Command, String[] playerNames)<br>
And then if your name is in the array you have access to the command?[/quote]Pretty much.</p>
