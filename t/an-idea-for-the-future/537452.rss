    <title>An Idea for the future</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/an-idea-for-the-future/537452</link>
    <description>Okay, well i have coded Java for quite some times, im wondering what source should i start off with? i have a basic main idea of an IRL banking system integrated inside the game. Simply meaning a loaning system and a monthly paying system to get good credit. Or bad credit and get in debt, more and more in debt. If you lets say take a loan of 10M gp, you might have to pay ehh 1M per week or so. just depends the time frame created, if you are able to pay this then your loan is payed off and your credit becomes good. Certain levels of credit.  10 being the beginners. 1 being the people badly in dept, and 20 being the people who pay their bills on time in game and can take a huge amount of cash out to get that special present. So how would it work you might ask? Well here is my basic idea.
Make it so when someone logs into the server, the server checks the person of their credit. Their credit would be default set to 10 meaning they have no credit and they would have to build it up.
now if its in the 9 or bellow the character will be in debt and starting to have bad credit. the game would track how much they loaned from an NPC and that NPC would have dialogue options, one to take a loan, and one to pay off a loan. YOU must pay the loan off on your own responsibility, it wont be automatically taken out of your bank. 
If a player has good credit they can take bigger loans, so it would set it as if the player wants to loan 2b and their credit equals 20 then they could have the loan knowing they would pay it off. But if their credit is 1 then they can have a tiny loan until they pay their debt off and start re-building their credit.. 
Know what would be the good sides of keeping good credit you might ask?
Well players with good credit will gain special commands, and 1 item of choice from the NPC for a reward on having good credit.

I don&#39;t know when i would have the time to code a server and integrate it into it but its something to look forward to in the future.</description>

The idea of any kind of loan in a server fails because</p>
<ol>
<li>The fact that you can create multiple accounts really means you can simply transfer the gold to one account to pay off your own loans.  Even if you make it IP-specific, users with any knowledge of proxies or users with certain types of internet (like me, where it changes with each reconnect) can easily get around it.</li>
<li>It typically isn’t needed, most servers are easy enough to get what you need without having to take out a loan to get started, even the more difficult ones.</li>
<li>People come and go too much, if they loan it to each other, most people on servers tend to be kids who quit just because they lost a god damn dicing match.</li>
<li>Most people who play servers (kids) don’t understand how economics or interest works.<br>
[/quote]</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes very true on <span class="hashtag">#1</span>, but you could also make to so you have to have a certian total level or a certian amount of time played in order to stop the multi-creating account problems occuring. theres ways to get around it all the time, IP isnt the main way, as it is one of the most common way people tend to do it but changing your ip is easy in this generation. BUT i do agree with you about the kids, now this could help them understand how it could be in real life. A game that could give them real life knowledge. not saying they have to use the system or they must use it, but it will be there for you if you needed a little cash becasue you lost your money dicing or some sort, but it also could be a trend to make players more active. if they take a loan, they could get intrest charged on them every week or so. making them not only going into debt but costing more to the server.[/quote]</p>
<ol>
<li>If you set the total level at a certain level then why would you even need a loan in the first place?  You can clearly gain the levels needed without said loan, so why would you need to take out one later?  It’s rather counter-intuitive, rather than encouraging people to be self-sustaining, you teach them to be dependent on a source that only makes them loose in the end?</li>
<li>If there’s ways to get around it, then it really shouldn’t be there.  It’s like locking a door when there’s an open window right next to it.<br>
3.Runescape already gives them real life knowledge.  Managing finances is a pretty useful skill, however does it really need to go as far as loans and interest?  It’s not like they’re buying things they need in Runescape either, like a house or car or fixing something like you would typically get a loan for.  Not to mention that you’re in a community where people want to log in, chat, and typically pk.  If they were there for some kind of long-term investment, the skills wouldn’t be so easy to train.</li>
<li>It really would add less drive to do anything.  If you got in such a bad spot where you had to take out a fat ass loan just to get equipment back again, that would more be encouraging them to simply head to greener pastures than to play in the dirt of what’s left in their bank.  People here give 0 fucks if they kill an entire community, that’s why you have the randoms that get into the VPS and reset everyone, or Ddos the server, it really doesn’t phase them.</li>
</ol>
<p>“making them not only going into debt but costing more to the server”  Do you mean it would effect me as well?  I’d rather not be charged MORE interest because people aren’t paying it.</p>
