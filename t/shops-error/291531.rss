    <title>Shops error :(</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shops-error/291531</link>
    <description>On the server that I am using atm, its an updated version of allstar scape, but anyway, i cant add any npc which you can talk to or shop, I have tried everything... nothing works, ill tell you what i have done:

In autospawn.cfg I added:
[code]
spawn = 2821    2613    3095    0    0    0    0    0    0    Farming Seller[/code]

In client.java I added:
Undernieth &quot;case 155: // first Click npc&quot;

[code]
 } else if (NPCID == 2821) { //Farming seller
                PutNPCCoords = true;
        WanneShop = 99;[/code]

In shops.cfg I added:
[code]
shop = 99    Farming Shop        1    1    5340    1000    5312    1000    5314    1000
[/code]
Now it wont show the shop... when i talk with the guy
Could it because shop 99 is to high? is there a limit or something? 
Well i tried changing the shop from 99 to 20, (removing the previous shop 20 just for testing)
and it still didn&#39;t work :((((((
i removed all shops untill shop 60, still isnt working</description>
