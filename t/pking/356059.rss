    <description>For some reason when you pk and you aren&#39;t skulled you still lose all items, and th 3 items kept on death disappear.  And when you die from like a bandos boss or kbd you get pkpoints.  317 delta.  And for some reason my webclient connects to localhost.  i changed everything to my server ip but nothing.  Also I made a new minigame and the shop that takes the tokens is messed up.  When you have 1 token and something is 100 tokens you can buy it with 1 token and 100gp.</description>

              <p>Remember to compile properly, I am not sure about the tokens; make sure they are declared to be used as the currency and the ‘i’ is used from the tokens and if the server causes you alot of problems I recommend downloading a clean server off the Server Downloads section.</p>
