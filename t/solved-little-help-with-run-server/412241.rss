    <title>Solved: Little help with run server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/solved-little-help-with-run-server/412241</link>
    <description>Well around 3 years ago I started developing an rsc server but went to uni and forgot about it, now I&#39;m on my placement year I figured I&#39;d have another little play.

I no longer have old machine and all of that was lost and I&#39;m now working with windows 7.

I&#39;ve downloaded a source etc and set up my paths but I&#39;m getting these errors below when I try to runserver. (Clients work fine)

              <p>Yeah the build.xml only occurs when i run as administrator.</p>
<p>The prob1 image shows what happens when I run normally.</p>
<p>Everything seems to compile OK and returns no errors :s</p>

              <p>Dis you go to your server folder and looked for the build.xml file? It just looks like it is missing.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
