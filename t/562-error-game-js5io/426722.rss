    <description>hey recently my cache link broke for my 562 server so i went into where the cache was downloaded to on my computer before it broke and put it on my desktop and zipped it.

after that i put it into the dropbox and got a link which i added into my 562 client in clientsettings.java
the cache download works and it tells them to restart the client but when they restart it stays on connecting to server and the error appears on the client cmd saying
error_game_js5io

if someone could that would be great i really need this to be fixed asap</description>
