This is the version of Pokemon2D on my Arsenal thread before I worked on the walking a bit. I&#39;m still going to continue that project, but this being a big stress period during college, I&#39;m forced to spend less time towards this, and more time towards my education. So, seeing as this covers some novice things needed for people to start building their game. I thought I would release so that others can learn from it, and even improve it. I&#39;m not a professional programmer, as expecting to get code equal to one would be rather silly. Things can be improved and many things are in the middle of being changed out. Ex: Spriteloader was being removed which just grabbing images with the default tool kit, but I got caught up with other things and was distracted from finishing. 

[B]Please before running just go into Fetch.java and change this:[/B]
[CODE]
public boolean isDownload() {
		return isDownload;
	}
[/CODE]
[B]To:[/B]
[CODE]
public boolean isDownload() {
		return false;
	}
[/CODE]
[ul][B]None of the required files on that host are needed for running or using any parts of the game or client. It was just to test the capabilities and debugging of the fetcher.[/B]

Download Link: [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?wlj0fl8m7g5zptc]Pokemon2D.rar[/url]
[list] Includes Client &amp; Server, they are integrated and will need a bit of customization to separate them[/list]

Photoshop Files Link: [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?q4hxsf5240m4kmx]Photoshop.rar[/url]
[list] I assume that many of these files are going to look for files on my computer that are required for the image. Sorry if this serves no use to you. [/list]

[list] The trick to making the buttons appear to change as they are clicked, is to change the image opacity to like 60 or 70 percent and then setting the button&#39;s value for opaque to false.[/list]

[list] If you are interested in future development involved with Pokemon, look into the PokemonRipper class in org.pokemon.util. It dumps many sprites needed in development with pokemon. Changing the STRING_INDEX value, and adding more addresses to siteUrls array, will allow for even more sprites. Would also recommend changing the folder it saves to &quot;cache/download/test&quot; each time you dump as well, or you will just be overwriting files with the same name and not getting anywhere. [/list]


[list] Image Background Sequence[/list]
[list] File downloading - Check for updates, or changes in file size [/list]
[IMG]http://i52.tinypic.com/21oyb7p.jpg[/img]

[list] Checks to see if user is banned or invalid password[/list]
[list] Launches website in Configuration.java[/list]
[list] Base 64 encoding and decoding for passwords [/list]
[list] Todo - Registration (auto registers if account isn&#39;t already created)[/list]
[IMG]http://i52.tinypic.com/5fn969.png[/img]

[list] Chatting area - (Removed &amp; Disabled chatting between multiple clients currently as integration between client &amp; server was to close)[/list]
[list] World list - Checks if word is online or not (Still need to integrate Mysql or some other sort of database for loading the hosts, also updating event for checking connections every x amount of time. Ranking and voting system later will be integrated) [/list]
[list] Two junk tabs not finished yet and serve no purpose[/list]
[list] Logout &amp; Playing Buttons [/list]
[IMG]http://i52.tinypic.com/2envp74.png[/img]
[IMG]http://i51.tinypic.com/281r1p4.png[/img]

[list] Three of the six tabs are handled. Those tabs are logout, pokemon inventory (rough start), and informational panel.[/list]
