    <title>Problems Running Aryan</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problems-running-aryan/1648</link>
    <description>Hey guys, this is my first post here. I was just recently introduced to Java, so be patient with me. :cool: 

Aryan was working fine for a couple of days with me, then I began receiving the message &quot;Runescape has been updated!&quot; every time I attempted to log in (starting this morning). So, I ran the aryan-update.bat hoping that might help. Now, it doesnt even load the client, saying this:

[url=http://www.mypicturespace.com][img]http://www.mypicturespace.com/uploads/687e34193c.jpg[/img][/url]


Any ideas on what I should do or what is going on? 

Thanks for the help  :D[br][size=1]Posted at: April 20, 2006, 09:30:28 am[/size][hr]Oh yea, plus everytime I try to compile it says there are 100 errors?[br][size=1]Posted at: April 20, 2006, 09:33:54 am[/size][hr]Well, if no one is willing to help, can somebody please send me a few viable links where I can re-download Aryan? Perhaps that will resolve the problem. 

Thank you.</description>

              <p>Theres a script pack (In finished scripts, I think) that you can just unzip to the correct folder. It comes compiled and everything. All you need to do is unzip it into */Aryan 374(or whatever)/Scripts</p>

              <p>Ok, I downloaded the newer version you guys just posted. The client is running fine. However, the new problem is the script database is very limited. Specifically, I just need the flax command /imp_flax() which I was running very nicely earlier. Is there an easy way to incorporate that script into the existing Aryan I just downloaded? Or does someone have a copy with that included?</p>
<p>Also, another question (while I’m at it): Mopar apparently updates a new version of Aryan after Jagex releases a game update. Whenever I ran the update.bat file it only messed everything up, what was I doing wrong? I’ve seen some posts claiming you can update it yourself if you “aren’t lazy”–yet I doubt that is feasible for a java novice like myself.</p>
<p>Which brings me to yet another inquiry: what are some good starting points (aside from this kick ass site) as an introduction to programming aryan/scar/etc.? I’ve read the FAQ tutorial and managed to become familiar with all the functions of the interface… now it’s time to go under the boards!</p>
<p>Again, I apologize for the noob questions–but you have to start somewhere <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
