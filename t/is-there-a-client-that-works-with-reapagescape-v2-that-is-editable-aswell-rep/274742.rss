              <p>Alright, the best client with that is Silab… but that is not editable… all other clients will have some errors ith items (as in a null)… The one that i use for that would be Skittles385’s client… you can add and subract items from “class8.java”… i have personally added 148 items to the one i got. But i also have one of her older ones. Her newest u get her 3 sets of clients and server for diferent versions in 1 BIG package… like 110MB lol… i personally dont like the servers… but the 317 client works best with Reapage V2… like i use… So yea, tell me what u think when ur complete…</p>
