    <description>Hey guys.

I have recently downloaded the Battlescape client and server. I am planning on doing some object and region placement work. I find that the Moparscape client is exceptional for this due to the coordinate convenience. For example, just by right-clicking an object it&#39;s coordinates are displayed, which is more convenient than noclipping and using a position command.

So I would like to use the Moparscape client with my Battlescape server source, however the Battlescape server only allows the Battlescape client to connect. I have looked for a long while now and canot find a way to allow Moparscape client connections. Does anybody know a method to do this?

All help is appreciated.

Thank you.</description>
