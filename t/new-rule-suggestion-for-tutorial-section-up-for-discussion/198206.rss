    <title>New Rule Suggestion For Tutorial Section (Up for discussion)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-rule-suggestion-for-tutorial-section-up-for-discussion/198206</link>
    <description>Well, lately, I&#39;ve been seeing all of these tutorials. Most of them are &quot;explained&quot;, if you can even say so, but all of them are specific to one and only one server: winterLove&#39;s. 

Problem is, this community needs to move away from that. There has been a few servers released that are 100x better (e.g. RS2DV), but because it is &quot;too hard&quot; to use people give up and move onto wL (mainly because there are plenty of C&amp;P tutorials for it.) 

So, I propose a new rule. I&#39;m not quite sure about its details yet, so I wanted to ask you guys. My proposal:
[i]No server-specific tutorials allowed. This includes tutorials directly aimed at winterLove&#39;s, Dodian, etc., you know how it goes.[/i] 

The above rule would, [i]hopefully[/i], expand our creativity and allow us to be more flexible. A(n) example(s) of these non-server specific tutorials could be:
http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,248818.0.html
http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,266796.0.html

Its an old tutorial of mine, but it can work as an example. There are a few lines winterLove-specific, which I still do not remember why I chose to do so, but they can easily be changed.

That&#39;s all I have to say. What do you think should be changed/added to this rule, if it is even a good one, and what can we do to make it better? I&#39;ve only got a bare idea of it at the moment, and I came here to post it so you guys can help me out on this one.</description>

So, Lothy, any second opinions/comments on this new rule, or any other rule that was suggested in this topic (e.g. one by Miss Silabsoft) ?<br>

Yep. Giving out misinformation has always been against the forum rules (ie, telling someone the wrong thing, like Silab has mentioned).<br>
If you see someone do such a thing then by all means take action.[/quote]Which means what you said earlier about MY rule suggestion is final? Hm.</p>

Deobfuscation didn’t work properly. It’s not uncommon for that to happen when using JAD - when I’ve deobbed clients in the past there has been at least one method that turns out like that most of the time.</p>

Great idea. I can’t stand it when I look at advice idiots give, and people take it seriously. For example, everyone now needs server restarters, and thinks that some if statements in your public boolean process will stop people from crashing your server.</p>
<p>Some stuff if just plain sad.</p>

<p>WL servers are one reason why MoparScapers fail. They pack everything in client.java, and focus on stuff like ‘server restarters’. They think that the fix to the problem is using dedicated servers and server restarters, and have no knowledge of Java. I’ve even seen people say to ‘get antilag.java it stops lag’ and make a public boolean process handler. The sad part is, a lot of people have them seriously.</p>
<p>I think we need to move as far away from WL servers as we can.</p>

<p>We actually discussed this before we moved away from the MoparScape CM ranks to the MoparScape vet ranks and iirc moparisthebest said if there was another server that came out he would switch to the whole site to that server like he said above, that other server hasn’t happened yet to the game-ready state like lothy said.[/quote]It’s game-ready alright. There’s no need to add our own spawn object, spawn npc, spawn item methods. They’re here to learn, or at least should be, and its there so they can do it themselves. If we make it “game-ready”, it’ll turn out just like winterLove’s, where all people would do is add a few new objects and NPCs and call it NAMEHEREScape.</p>

              <p>I really think I should bring this topic back up.</p>
<p>We just increased the staff’s member count, and enforcing a rule like this should be a piece of cake. We’re slowly getting better as a community, and if we want to get anywhere closer, I believe we should make this a rule AND ENFORCE IT.</p>
<p>It really isnt hard to make a tutorial not-server-specific, and in the process of reading a real tutorial, the members here would learn from it. So, I know a lot of you disagree, but I’m standing where I was earlier. What do the rest of you think?</p>
<p>P.S. I know its not ‘fair’ for winterLove servers. But you see, a tutorial that is not server-specific means <span class="bbcode-b">ANY SERVER WOULD BE ABLE TO USE IT.</span> So in the end, its a win-win situtation. There is no loss.</p>

<p>Exactly, and if someone ever gets around to doing that then the whole site will switch over to that and winterlove’s base will be a thing of the past.  Until then our hands are pretty much tied.</p>

<p>Only problem is, that’s what everyone uses. If it’s non server specific, then it’s sort of a Java language tutorial, nomsain? We should have a sideboard for RS2D tutorials.<br>

<p>Face it, the current breed of ‘moparscapers’ will never even think about moving away from servers built from wL’s base. Rather they’d cringe at the thought.<br>
[/quote]We shouldn’t just give up because of that; we should <span class="bbcode-i">atleast</span> try to do something about it. But anytime somebody suggests a step towards the ‘better side,’ everybody (staff members included), put that person down (not saying you guys did - but previously), and tell them it’ll never happen. Instead of thinking negative, why dont we actually <span class="bbcode-b">TRY</span> to do something?[/quote]<br>
TeleNubby, you know as much as I do, 99.5% of the people that use <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> are stupid, hands down. I am not trying to be negative, as I’d never do that to you, &lt;3. But, seriously. See it from mopar’s point of view. If we get rid of winterlove’s from this site, they form their own website, etc, mopar loses lots of ad money.</p>
