    <title>NSA wiretapping: bad?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/nsa-wiretapping-bad/522259</link>
    <description>[b][u]Topic[/u][/b]
As many of you may know, the NSA for the past years has undergone warrant-less wiretapping of American citizens in attempts to achieve the goal of reducing terrorist threats. The NSA had been doing this for years without telling American citizens. Well, then how did we find out about it?

The answer is Edward Snowden. Snowden is a non-anonymous leak that had been working for the NSA under a cushy salary for some time. I&#39;m not going to try to explain what he says, because I can just show you:
[youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yB3n9fu-rM[/youtube]

Now what I want to ask you people is simple: which side do you take? Recent opinion polls - if to be believed - say that 65% of Americans are now very skeptical of the NSA and feel the right to some answers. I guess what I&#39;m asking is (if you&#39;re an American), do you feel that the NSA should have listened in to the millions of everyday conversations through technology without telling us or without obtaining a warrant first?

[b][u]Thesis[/u][/b]
I have several contentions on this. Firstly, I am going to argue, that whether or not you feel the NSA should be doing this, this at least should&#39;ve been a decision made by the citizens. Or, at the very least, debated publicly by politicians [i]before[/i] it happened. Barack Obama and George Bush should have, at the very least, let the American people know before it was done, or better yet, allow some sort of democratic strategy decide on it.

Second, the act of warrant-less wiretapping directly contradicts the 4th amendment of the Constitution, which states:

&quot;[i]The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.[/i]&quot;

The American people have the right to their privacy if the NSA never received a warrant. Now, this doesn&#39;t necessarily mean their [i]hiding[/i] something - many Americans everyday will tag what locations they are on Facebook and tell people constantly what they&#39;re doing on Twitter. Many peoples&#39; lives are out in the open. But there&#39;s a noticeable difference here. Through social media, it&#39;s [i]voluntary[/i]. No one was forced to account for every little detail of their life. Being a participant of the NSA wiretapping was in no way optional.

My final contention is that Barack Obama really has just given up on civil rights this time. In 2007, he spoke out adamantly against wiretapping under the Bush administration, and vowed that he would dismiss all of it. Now, in 2013, he is making petty excuses like &quot;well, if you wanna be safe, you&#39;ll have to lose a few rights.&quot; That is a valid contention to start a debate Mr. Obama, but it directly contradicts the 4th amendment to the Constitution. You are allowed to express disagreements with the Constitution, but until these amendments change, you [i]must[/i] follow all of the amendments strictly.

Those are my views. What do you all think?</description>

<p>The NSA’s surveillance on Americans is a non-issue from now on. You can take action and stop it if you want. Foreigners can’t.[/quote]<br>
I think the reason most Americans aren’t revolting is because they’ve pretty much guessed they’ve been doing it all along, and the fact that most American’s biggest worry is the NSA knowing they’ve been sexting their 13 year old girlfriend. I’m not breaking any major laws that I know of, and I’m not a terrorist so I really don’t mind. If it’s removing the risk of potential terrorist threats then the more power to them, SO LONG AS THEY ARE KEPT IN CHECK. I don’t feel like accepting this, then 10 years later the gov’t is going “We’re now cracking down on crime. If we hear anyone planning anything we are now going to arrest you on conspiracy charges!”</p>
<p>And yes, we should have known when they started this.</p>

<p>Sure, that is of concern, but my point is that our Constitution rules it illegal for the government to do this on its own American citizens. Like I said, foreign policy in America is beyond repair.</p>
<p>[quote=“Elrick, post:6, topic:522259”]So long as they are not using information gathered through tapping to persecute or pursue those who are not participating in potential terrorism, I don’t really care if they are or not.

<p>If they’re saying oh we’re using tapping to capture terrorism plots, then additionally using it to spy on the pot dealer down the road from me (figuratively speaking) in order to crack down on his operation, then I have a problem with that and that info should be considered fruit from the poison tree.</p>
<p>Also, I think it is BS that the Whistleblower is being condemned a terrorist simply because he felt the citizens of the USA should know what their gov’t is doing.[/quote]<br>

<p>Well, what Americans think do matter my friend. You see, the whole reason why Obama was spying on foreign soil was because: that’s right!

As many of you may know, the NSA for the past years has undergone warrant-less wiretapping of American citizens in attempts to achieve the goal of reducing terrorist threats. The NSA had been doing this for years without telling American citizens. Well, then how did we find out about it?</p>
<p>The answer is Edward Snowden. Snowden is a non-anonymous leak that had been working for the NSA under a cushy salary for some time. I’m not going to try to explain what he says, because I can just show you:<br>
[youtube]<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yB3n9fu-rM%5B/youtube%5D" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yB3n9fu-rM[/youtube]</a></p>
<p>Now what I want to ask you people is simple: which side do you take? Recent opinion polls - if to be believed - say that 65% of Americans are now very skeptical of the NSA and feel the right to some answers. I guess what I’m asking is (if you’re an American), do you feel that the NSA should have listened in to the millions of everyday conversations through technology without telling us or without obtaining a warrant first?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Thesis</span></span><br>
I have several contentions on this. Firstly, I am going to argue, that whether or not you feel the NSA should be doing this, this at least should’ve been a decision made by the citizens. Or, at the very least, debated publicly by politicians <span class="bbcode-i">before</span> it happened. Barack Obama and George Bush should have, at the very least, let the American people know before it was done, or better yet, allow some sort of democratic strategy decide on it.</p>
<p>Second, the act of warrant-less wiretapping directly contradicts the 4th amendment of the Constitution, which states:</p>
<p>“<span class="bbcode-i">The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</span>”</p>
<p>The American people have the right to their privacy if the NSA never received a warrant. Now, this doesn’t necessarily mean their <span class="bbcode-i">hiding</span> something - many Americans everyday will tag what locations they are on Facebook and tell people constantly what they’re doing on Twitter. Many peoples’ lives are out in the open. But there’s a noticeable difference here. Through social media, it’s <span class="bbcode-i">voluntary</span>. No one was forced to account for every little detail of their life. Being a participant of the NSA wiretapping was in no way optional.</p>
<p>My final contention is that Barack Obama really has just given up on civil rights this time. In 2007, he spoke out adamantly against wiretapping under the Bush administration, and vowed that he would dismiss all of it. Now, in 2013, he is making petty excuses like “well, if you wanna be safe, you’ll have to lose a few rights.” That is a valid contention to start a debate Mr. Obama, but it directly contradicts the 4th amendment to the Constitution. You are allowed to express disagreements with the Constitution, but until these amendments change, you <span class="bbcode-i">must</span> follow all of the amendments strictly.</p>
<p>Those are my views. What do you all think?</p>
