      As server progress and become more and more easy to run, people lose the intrest in running them as real company. I mean sure its great to have a bunch of friends on a server you run, but why not do it with a little class? Well now my friend Jono and myself are making a server that is run and kept perfect at all times. No more unreliable sources that could shut down at any time without knowing it! We have legal documents to copyright our site and keep Jagex at bay! We are starting a full community with a server for all and we will have 5 game worlds. We will have webclients for Runescape classic and 317 and 508,525,562, and HD!! We will never stop because there is always room to grow. To check out the website beta visit.

Good luck.[/quote] Thank you, (for the last part anyway) We have the site, a 8gb ram dedicated server and 10 staff for the forums and 6 mods and 3 admins for the game. Were doing good so far and were coding a mysql file to give 20m for voting and make it easier to get your items when you donate. We hope to one day be what Moparscape has become.</p>
