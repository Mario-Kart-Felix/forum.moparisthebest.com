    <title>Level Up Then Freeze</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/level-up-then-freeze/338490</link>
    <description>Hello, i could not find any TUT&#39;s or recent posts on this topic. 

Ok so i took some stalls for thieving and put them at my home. I clicked them to double check and it worked. So i wean&#39;t and changed the exp you receive and the money. Then i leveled and froze, i thought it was the money and exp but after retrying them both, so i switched it back to the original coding, and tried it. I leveled and then froze.

Got any tips?</description>
