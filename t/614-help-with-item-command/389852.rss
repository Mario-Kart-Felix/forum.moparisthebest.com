    <title>[614] Help with item command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/614-help-with-item-command/389852</link>
    <description>I am using Darthax&#39;s fixed 614 server. I have found out how to get out of the starter area, but I can&#39;t quite figure out how to get the item command to work. I&#39;ve searched everywhere and looked at possible solutions to the problem, like ManzpkScape&#39;s tutorial on the item command. I followed that and only got errors. Has someone found a correct solution to the item command or has a working item command for the fixed 614 server? I would greatly appreciate it.</description>
