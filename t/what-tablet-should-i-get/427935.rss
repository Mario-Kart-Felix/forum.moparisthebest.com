    <title>What tablet should I get?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-tablet-should-i-get/427935</link>
    <description>Well I would never buy a tablet but I recently found that all of my college textbooks can be bought (pirated) as ebooks. So I contacted my teachers and they said they do not care if its hardcover or ebook as long as I read the assigned material. So basically what tablet should I buy for this purpose, I dont want to get some cheapo tablet JUST for this purpose, I also want something that is decently powerful and will allow me to do other things such as being able to remote desktop, word processing, watching 1080p video. Anyone know of a tablet that will perform these tasks well? I was thinking of just getting an iPad as the benchmarks have shown that it is even faster than the Asus Transformer Prime, but I see that they may be releasing another one soon so what should I do?</description>

<p>That’s annoying too. I mean, you’ll always have a phone or other device that comes with a normal mini-usb wall charger, which can be used with all your other devices. Of course, Apple decided to make cash cows out of their customers.</p>

Yes, It does, If you used an sd card and store stuff on it, and you apparently downloaded a .ipa file (installer file format for ios) and it wasn’t developed by a certified developer, it was written maliciously and it gets your phone in a state of no turning back, unless of course you want to restore your phone or something<br>

It’s not because they don’t add an sd card because their cheap, its because they are extreme about their software security</p>

<p>I know, I have them all as pdfs right now but I feel the convenience of a tablet would be much nicer I took a look at the Asus EEE Pad Transformer but the fact that it doesn’t come with the dock is ridiculous when I could just buy a Bluetooth keyboard or the like. I like the iPad but fact that its at the end of its product cycle worries me. I guess worst case I could just keep buying an iPad and returning it within 30 days until the iPad 3 comes but that becomes a bit tedious</p>

              <p>Well I would never buy a tablet but I recently found that all of my college textbooks can be bought (pirated) as ebooks. So I contacted my teachers and they said they do not care if its hardcover or ebook as long as I read the assigned material. So basically what tablet should I buy for this purpose, I dont want to get some cheapo tablet JUST for this purpose, I also want something that is decently powerful and will allow me to do other things such as being able to remote desktop, word processing, watching 1080p video. Anyone know of a tablet that will perform these tasks well? I was thinking of just getting an iPad as the benchmarks have shown that it is even faster than the Asus Transformer Prime, but I see that they may be releasing another one soon so what should I do?</p>
