    <title>Human control of mouse</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/human-control-of-mouse/292403</link>
    <description>I am interested in creating a mouseMove function that moves the mouse to a given x, y coordinates. 

I am planning on just making it linear first, then adding some randomness to it.

How exactly does a computer &quot;see&quot; human mouse input? Is a full path of adjacent cursor positions seen by the computer or are positions skipped when the user moves the mouse rather quickly?

In addition to the above, how often would an online game poll for the mouse position, and if it were detecting botting, would it expect to see the mouse hitting adjacent pixels always or could it skip some?</description>

</aside>
<p>This. The game client doesn’t need to poll for the position itself, as Java’s input system is event-driven, however as far as I can guess there would be a delay between events significant enough to cause dropped positions (someone can confirm this I’m sure)</p>
<p>However, the best way to find out exactly what the client would see is to gather some data - write an app to capture mouse movement events and test it yourself - you’re going to need the data anyway to implement your algorithm, surely, unless you plan on using something that is already available.</p>
