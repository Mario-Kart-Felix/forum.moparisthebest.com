    <title>New project [RSCMopar] - (coders check)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-project-rscmopar-coders-check/354333</link>
    <description>[b]Hello![/b]

Im here for just idea.
RSCAngel is dead and something is missed now..
This community needs new server (imo - in my opinion)

[b]What exactly?[/b]

Strong and knowledge coder team, who can handle this new project.

Original RSC copy-paste.

That means when you create account, then you are nonmember player, you can make all nonmember skills and walk around nonmember area.

Original EXP!

Subscribers/donators/members can only access member area/skills etc, no exp boost or what eva you think about.

No new custom items/areas... Just like original RSC.

Respectable/famous server name. Like RSCDaemon/RSCStork/RSCAngel/RSCEmulation have.

Active developing team

2 servers nonmember and member world.
or mixing them to one. Like if have subscriber/member status then you can walk trought gates etc.. access all member skills.

----------------------------------------

Now you want to say: &quot;Why you don&#39;t make yourself that kind of server?&quot;

I&#39;m not that good to make.

I&#39;m active reading person in this section and I know there are many good coders around here and (imo - in my opinion) should we gathering them all to one server.
I&#39;m not going to say names here, because I&#39;m sure I will miss someone and I don&#39;t want this.


So what you guys think about it?</description>

I take it you’re an only child.</p>
<p>If you want something done, do it yourself. Otherwise this is just another poorly structured topic which will not entice/motivate anybody worth having on the project to get off their ass.</p>
<p>Also it’s only because rsca went down that you’re writing this topic, you should move on.</p>
<p>Too lazy to de-rep you myself for this junk.</p>

<p>apparently they send you a mail to see what the RS means in your site, so its probably the best to say it means rocket sience(the movie), lol</p>
