<p>Set proper Java Environmental Variables, or use what the web guy said.</p>
<p>if the main class can’t be found, make sure your path to it is valid.<br>
Same goes if it can’t find the path.<br>
The other error is because of EV’s.</p>

So, me and my friend, wanting to host a source and fudge around with admin features, pk each other and stuff tried finding a working server source yesterday for over 6 hours. Every single time we downloaded and used a source, there would either be path finding errors “can’t find path” or “can’t find main class”, or “this is not an internal or external command” or 100 errors etc.</p>
<p>I made sure my Java Environmental Variables were set correct by watching thousands of tutorials. Anybody want a challenge?<br>
If you can make it so i can run at least one source in downloads, i’ll give you two bucks or something over paypal and love you <span class="bbcode-u">forever</span>.<br>
I got teamviewer, if you’d like to help me over that. I can also screenshare.</p>

<p>Recently i tried hosting and running these clients and server:<br>
BeastPk<br>
Spawn-Scape<br>
Deathlypvpz 4.0<br>

<p>Yeah, payments aren’t allowed man.</p>
<p>Anyways, don’t bother with setting up the environmental variables. If you edit your run.bat file with notepad or some other text editor, you’ll see “javac” somewhere, replace that with the location of your javac.exe. For example…</p>
<p>Replace this: (and only this, leave the rest of the line alone)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>With this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>You may have to make some changes depending on what version of JDK you have. To figure it out go to C:/ &gt; Program Files [or Program Files (x86) &gt; Java &gt; jdk#.#.<span class="hashtag">#_</span>##/ … And that’ll tell you what version you have. If you still can’t figure it out, add me on Skype and I’ll do it for you. But keep in mind, payments aren’t accepted on these forums. People here help solely out of kindness.</p>
