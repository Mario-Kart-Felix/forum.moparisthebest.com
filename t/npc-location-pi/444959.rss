    <description>I am running a PI server and I need to change the shop locations. I went into the spawn.cfg file and changed the coordinates of the shops to where I want then and I compiled the server. I turned the server back on and Giles was not where I put him. I went back into the spawn.cfg and looked at the coordiantes and I teleported to them and it was where I wanted Giles to be so I know that the coordinates are correct. Giles was already spawned and had items in him shop. So all I had to do was change the coordinates, but that did not work. So how can I fix this?</description>

              <p>Okay, what you maybe need to do it spawn-config and find his ID and switch the coords, should look like this…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>#'s are Xcoords.<br>
%'s are Ycoords.<br>
*'s is the NPC’s ID.</p>
<p>Hope this helped ya (:…</p>

              <p>Were you changing the spawn file located in [tt]data.cfg.spawn-config.cfg[/tt] or [tt]bin.spawn-config.cfg[/tt]</p>
<p>Sometimes when you load a project with an IDE and it deletes the bin folder to recompile, it takes everything from all folders and moves it to the bin folder.</p>
