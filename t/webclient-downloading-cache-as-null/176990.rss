    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-downloading-cache-as-null/176990</link>
    <description>My webclient ( not really mine, my brothers ) located at www.bashscape.info/rs2stuff/play.php is downloading all its files with the prefix of null. And what i am pretty sure should be cache.zip is just simply Null, and it is growing as big as it can. How can i fix this problem as i dont think the web client will work with it likle this.</description>
