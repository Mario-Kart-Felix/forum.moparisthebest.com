    <title>Can someone give me some advice, please?</title>

    <description>Hey,

I want to make a private server, and with make I mean, change alot of things.
But I want to make some kind of &quot;skilling&quot; area for my server. Like, a small place where you can train every non-combat skill and with a bank in it.
I know how to add a bank but I don&#39;t know how to add the other things.

But my actual question is, Does anyone know a source and client to start with? Something where i can add these features without issues.
I worked with PI but I wanna try something else, like delta. (I want the old RS graphics)

Thnx!</description>

Well type in google of in search: blank server or 317 server<br>
And youtube &amp; google will help you with code just type: how to code your rsps<br>
Its not hard you get ur coords and u can build there whit the id of the item…<br>
To get the ids go google: rsps all object ids</p>
