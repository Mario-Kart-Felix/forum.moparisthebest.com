    <title>How to make small based operating systems like Rockbox?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-small-based-operating-systems-like-rockbox/165409</link>
    <description>I just got a new Zune for the holidays, and it&#39;s nice, but I really want to hack it. I look at the new mods out there like Rockbox and iPodLinux, and I would really like to make one for my Zune.

I know enough to downgrade the firmware so that I can activate external hard drive mode, and after that I can access the bios, and insert a program that starts up before the zune software. The only problem for me is, using the controls of the zune, and keeping components like the wifi and radio intact.

If anyone could give me any tips, it would be very appreciated, or if someone could direct me towards a site for development of something like rockbox, where I could gather more ideas. 

Thanks for reading,
Buzzy</description>
