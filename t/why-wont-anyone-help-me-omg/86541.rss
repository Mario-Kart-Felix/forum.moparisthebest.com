1,Do you mean did i set colors? im brand new to scripts if you wana download it and show me where i should set the demensions or what lines the demensions are that would be great.<br>
2.yes<br>
3.I have tried different bank slots i think most the time im at the one closest to the door.<br>
4.It said  as bright as it can be.<br>
5.i put it as bright as it can be.<br>
6.You mean the green part? i understand most of it want me to post what i dont understand?<br>
Side question. You modified it as in rewrote the script yourself?</p>
<p>The un-named<br>
I dont know how to contact him but maybe the link that i downloaded the script from was changed around by the person who posted it. If you coul find me the latest verzion or if any of you could that would be sweet.<br>
And what kinda java do i have to use to not get my main bannd? you know in the resolution screen right befor it list the worlds. thanks.</p>
<p>And for the future does any one know a really good free yew cutter? or is the is it smarter to buy one?</p>
