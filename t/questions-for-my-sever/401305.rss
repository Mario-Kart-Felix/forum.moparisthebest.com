    <title>Questions for my sever</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/questions-for-my-sever/401305</link>
    <description>ok ii got lots of questions
i use the sever DemolishScape v6

if that helps

ok so lets get started

how to i change who appears in stafflist command? (for example i type ::stafflist, and he has a bunch of people already there)

how do you remove someones mem? when i make someone a mem, in characters, 
character-ismember = 0
it is 0 no matter what, so is there no mem?

how do i use the pickup command? does it pickup items?

what is the pk2 command?

what is the tb command?

how do i use the pickup command?

how do i get rid of npc&#39;s?

how do i tele to certain people?

how do i tele to certain coords?

how do i add commands? it doesnt seem to be working. (i have the right code, i place it in the right spot, for axample here is one of my codes

if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;gold&quot;)&amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 3){               //Voule Command Generator if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;gold&quot;)){                      //Voule Command Generator 
addItem(0995,2147000000);
sendMessage(&quot;you&#39;ve got gold&quot;);
sendMessage(&quot;You have left to spend&quot;);
}




how can i change the default server ip on the client? (when i open it, it automatically goes to the guys that made the client, and im guessing theirs is down cause it does not work)



one last question, how do i change everything that says DemolishScape(his server name) to masterscapers(my server name)
is it in client.class?

thanks</description>
