I was the owner of goldenpk back in 2007 not sure if anybody still plays from then, Anyways back then it was all about making servers for silabsoft clients, Now i am back and would like to start a new server but not sure on what the up to date clients are which most people use to base their servers on? Can anybody help me please.</description>
