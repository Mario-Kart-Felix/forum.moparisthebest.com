    <title>Help with GFX&#39;s?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-gfxs/375841</link>
    <description>Hello again,
I have adding skillcape emotes to my delta server. It uses blurr client.
I have added the ints to source. Made the button. But how to do with the gfx&#39;?
I have control panel on my server. I have added gfx&#39;s to my models folder i have added the ints to class23 compiled logged in writted add model ****(this i changed &quot;****&quot; to my models id&#39;s).So how i said i my control panel is fucntion that lets to force gfx&#39;s.
I looked all gfx&#39;s ags , sgs, bgs etc..
But when i tried the skillcape gfx&#39;s they wasnt working.
And it says the animation of gfx example 4549 i forced animation and its just standing animation.
Maybe anyone can help me or post link of tutorial that help&#39;s to add fully working skillcape emote&#39;s to delta.

Thanks &lt;33</description>
