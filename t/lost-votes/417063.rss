    <title>Lost Votes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lost-votes/417063</link>
    <description>A while ago I cut all contact with the user known on these forums as &quot;danielmedveczk&quot; Profile link: [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=245208]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=245208[/url]

He changed the toplist spot we had for the server &quot;XlightcoreX&quot; Link: http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php?server=xlightcorex.no-ip.info

Now he has changed it to &quot;Codeusa Software&quot; And all the votes have carried over..

He does still have access to the page but he cannot change the IP .. As I have spoke with him on Skype

If anything could be done about this I would appreciate it

Thanks

Scott

<p>Yes, that would work, all the check is for is to confirm you have access to the domain name, nothing else.</p>

I would love to help you get it back up again, and talk about the things i did wrong, and explain why i did it.</p>
<p>Hope we can speak about it.</p>

<p>The No-IP Was on a shared account that I now have regained access to, The .info No-IP Was removed from that account and added on another… Hence why I have contacted No-IP Support</p>
