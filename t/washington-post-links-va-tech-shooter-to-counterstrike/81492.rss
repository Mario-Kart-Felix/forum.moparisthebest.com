    <title>Washington Post Links (VA Tech) Shooter to Counterstrike</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;It looks like the witch hunt is really starting to kick into overdrive.

Hours after the shooting you had people on national television speculating that the shooter, who had yet to be identified, was a gamer and that his playing of games likely led to the rampage.

Today multiple media organizations are already starting to dig into the whole violence and video game angle. At least one unnamed publication put out a query looking for anyone knowledgeable &quot;about shooter/violent video games&quot; who would be willing to write an article for a major daily.

The Washington Post, quick to get reporters to the childhood neighborhood of the shooter, posted a five page article on their site this evening. In it they say Cho Seung Hui was a &quot;fan of violent video games.&quot;

Several Korean youths who knew Cho Seung Hui from his high school days said he was a fan of violent video games, particularly Counterstrike, a hugely popular online game published by Microsoft, in which players join terrorism or counterterrorism groups and try to shoot each other using all types of guns. 
Marshall Main, a neighbor who lived across the Chos in the quiet community of townhomes, said the Chos were hardly ever home, but always waved and smiled when greeted. The couple worked long hours at a dry cleaner, neighbors said.



What they don&#39;t say is whether it has anything to do with the shooting. And, granted, it is only one graph in the story, but it does make you wonder if he was also a fan of violent music, violent television, violent movies. Whether he read Catcher in the Rye. 

Fact without perspective is almost as bad as lies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Here we go again. I said wow.
