    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/its-this-what-i-think-it-is/103669</link>
    <description>Noone ever bothers to look in their client.java and whats really in it, and theres so much you can do to reduce lag by soo much, just by changing 5 or 10 words easy as that, adding \ as well,  people who know what im talking about, know what im talking about...

[b]Anyways...[/b]


Is this what i think it is...:

 MyOutput = new PrintStream(new FileOutputStream(&quot;C:/Documents and Settings/ ETCCCC

 MyOutput = new PrintStream(new FileOutputStream(&quot;ftp://ebefnnw@ft/ ETCCCCCC

Saves stats to an FTP server? [b]I[/b] personally think it is...I&#39;ma try it out, if anyone could enlighten me on this? would be much appreciated..</description>
