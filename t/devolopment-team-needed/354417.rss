              <p>Name - Ben<br>
Age - I prefer not to say but if I have to I’ll PM it to you <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Location - Western Australia<br>
Position wanted - Co Owner<br>
Why - I want to become your Co owner because I can also code the stuff below. I own my own RSPS and it’s very fine and we almost have 400 members on the forum. I’m experienced and have met a lot of different coders in my journey of playing Runescape Private Servers <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
your goal to achieve when helping - I want to improve my coding and I want to become apart of your making of your RSPS. I’ll be happy to help with it if you need help, just PM me what and I’ll jump onto it straight away <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Just a quick PM to the link of your website or I can make you a Runescape Featured website quick and easy <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Thanks you for reading my application and again I want to be a Co Owner and I can also do the things below.<br>
This is why I think I should be a co owner of your RSPS <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
