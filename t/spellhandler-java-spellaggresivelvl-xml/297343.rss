    <description>Hey guys,
was wondering how to add working godspell animations to an RSCD source so that the object appears at the targets location when you cast the spell.
I know the answer lies in &quot;SpellHandler.java&quot; and the code needed to be added 
simply recieves the targets coords (location) and spawns an object there for 1 second then removes it.
The animation itself works fine, but I&#39;m having trouble getting this code working. At the moment I have the spell &quot;Charge&quot; 
working and has a very similar formula to it compared to the godspells.

Here it is:
[code]			case (case number): // Charge
				if(world.getTile(player.getLocation()).hasGameObject()) {
					player.getActionSender().sendMessage(&quot;You cannot charge here, please move to a different area.&quot;);
					return;
				}
				if(!checkAndRemoveRunes(player, spell)) {
					return;
				}
      				GameObject charge = new GameObject(player.getLocation(), 1147, 0, 0); // ( Object ID, X coord, Y coord)
      				world.registerGameObject(charge);
      				world.delayedRemoveObject(charge, 500);
      				player.setCharged();
      				finalizeSpell(player, spell);
				break;[/code]

Ill be trying to do it myself, but if anyone knows the code or has it. It would save a little time, cheers :)
I can figure it out myself, but I just need a little help to speed things up.


And with Spellaggresivelvl.xml:

How does this xml work? If someone could give me a quick explaination, that would be great.</description>
