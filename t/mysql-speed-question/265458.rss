    <title>MySQL Speed Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mysql-speed-question/265458</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m making a private server, but this question isn&#39;t focused solely on the server. I&#39;m basically loading data from a MySQL Database, but i was wondering if it would be faster if i loaded it from a file. Like instead of loading the info from a table, loading it from a file. Would it be faster, or would it really depend on the application?</description>

It doesn’t.</p>
<p>Databases are used over files though because it’s easy to modify or expand a database, whereas it’s harder to modify a file after the original design.</p>
