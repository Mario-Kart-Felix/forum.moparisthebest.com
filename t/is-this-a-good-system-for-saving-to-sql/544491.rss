    <title>Is this a good system for saving to SQL?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-this-a-good-system-for-saving-to-sql/544491</link>
    <description>Alright.. Just made this system up to save player information to SQL. This information will be integrated to show &quot;Player Cards&quot; on SMF/MyBB profiles. On logout, the SQL is saved, or if the player does, ironically, the command, [i][b]::save[/b][/i]. The fastest I&#39;ve got it is 1/20th of a second (47ms) but depending on how much I&#39;m running on my computer it has taken up to 375ms, in bad occasions. Here is how the system works..

I&#39;m utilizing StringBuilder, first off I initialize all the StringBuilders..
[code=java]StringBuilder ids = new StringBuilder();
			StringBuilder amts = new StringBuilder();
			StringBuilder equipId = new StringBuilder();
			StringBuilder equipAmt = new StringBuilder();
			StringBuilder lookSB = new StringBuilder();
			StringBuilder skillLvl = new StringBuilder();
			StringBuilder skillXp = new StringBuilder();
			StringBuilder itemId = new StringBuilder();
			StringBuilder itemAmt = new StringBuilder();[/code]

Then I have loops that push values to the string builder.. Looking something like this. 
[code=java]
for (int i = 0; i &lt; c.bankItems.length; i++) {
				if (c.bankItems[i] &gt; 0) {
					ids.append(Integer.toString(c.bankItems[i])+&quot; &quot;);
					amts.append(Integer.toString(c.bankItemsN[i])+&quot; &quot;);
				}
			}
[/code]

Then the query is simply the column names and StringBuilderName.toString(); 

Now the values are in the database and the delimiter is simply a space. So I can just use explode() to get each individual value.

[i][b]What do you think about this system? Is there a better way? Average time for a player to log out is ~120ms.[/b][/i]</description>

This is not the right way to do this.</p>
<p>First of all you should be utilizing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">relational model</a>.</p>
<p>Storing everything as text does not allow you to create a proper unique key and managing this would be a nightmare. There is nothing wrong with 600 rows for someones bank.<br>

<p>I first used a relational database, where everything was linked to playerName. And separate tables for bank, stats, etc. However, saving 600 rows for someones bank is extremely slow. I would rather have this system lack website-sided.[/quote]I have a feeling you could easily optimise that. Maybe only update rows for bank slots that have changed since the last save, etc. If you don’t want relational then don’t use SQL… there are plenty of other databases available.</p>

Okay, lets use the highscores example. How will you find the top 10 people in Magic? The current system requires you to select every player, explode their level and xp into arrays, and then sort those arrays and grab the first 10. Using a properly designed table you could use a simple query:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Lets use another example. How will you find the number of coins in everyone’s bank? You’d have to select every single player, explode their bank ids and amounts, linear search until you find the coins, and then add them all up. Or:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>

<p>Hmm, okay. Is doing that easy to do? So basically… If the player has more than 25, split the queries into 25 at a time and queue them? But is an average for ~70ms of saving to SQL that bad? Even though it’ll be slow as crap website-sided most likely.</p>
<p>Alright, saving all skills, a full inventory, and 100 items in bank takes 78ms. Is it <span class="bbcode-i">that</span> bad?<br>

Yes it is bad. You can’t do something like count the number of coins in the game using a simple sql query, or get the total XP earned in one skill, etc. It also means when you go to write highscores you will have to process that string array for every single player and then sort them.</p>
<p>Check with your SQL driver for batching implementations.

<p>Yes, on a half ass computer. The quickest I got it was at 46ms. And that’s for all skills, items, inventory, and other player information. Plus that’s included to saving to a text file. Not sure on average how long it should take to save to a text file.</p>

<p>Hmm, okay. Is doing that easy to do? So basically… If the player has more than 25, split the queries into 25 at a time and queue them? But is an average for ~70ms of saving to SQL that bad? Even though it’ll be slow as crap website-sided most likely.</p>

<p>If that’s how long it takes to save it to the characters file and website, then no that’s beautiful!</p>

              <p>Alright… Just made this system up to save player information to SQL. This information will be integrated to show “Player Cards” on SMF/MyBB profiles. On logout, the SQL is saved, or if the player does, ironically, the command, <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">::save</span></span>. The fastest I’ve got it is 1/20th of a second (47ms) but depending on how much I’m running on my computer it has taken up to 375ms, in bad occasions. Here is how the system works…</p>
<p>I’m utilizing StringBuilder, first off I initialize all the StringBuilders…</p>
<p><code>StringBuilder ids = new StringBuilder();
			StringBuilder amts = new StringBuilder();
			StringBuilder equipId = new StringBuilder();
			StringBuilder equipAmt = new StringBuilder();
			StringBuilder lookSB = new StringBuilder();
			StringBuilder skillLvl = new StringBuilder();
			StringBuilder skillXp = new StringBuilder();
			StringBuilder itemId = new StringBuilder();
			StringBuilder itemAmt = new StringBuilder();</code></p>
<p>Then I have loops that push values to the string builder… Looking something like this.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">for (int i = 0; i &lt; c.bankItems.length; i++) {
				if (c.bankItems[i] &gt; 0) {
					ids.append(Integer.toString(c.bankItems[i])+" ");
					amts.append(Integer.toString(c.bankItemsN[i])+" ");
				}
			}</code></pre>
<p>Then the query is simply the column names and StringBuilderName.toString();</p>
<p>Now the values are in the database and the delimiter is simply a space. So I can just use explode() to get each individual value.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zBwvBeZ.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">What do you think about this system? Is there a better way? Average time for a player to log out is ~120ms.</span></span></p>
