    <title>One file client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/one-file-client/292634</link>
    <description>Well people are starting to dupe on my server with a different client, they are finding my UID. I want to make my client only 1 file so people can&#39;t find my UID from the signlink. Im sure I can somehow make my client into a jar or exe and I have a Jar Maker, I just don&#39;t know how to use it. I need some major help - please help!</description>

<p>One thing you could do is change your UID once more, compile signlink.java, and then remove signlink.java from the client files, and put it on your computer somewhere.</p>

<p>Well I only gave them the .class files and made them hidden, but they decompiled it and found the UID. I’m just having trouble with JAR Maker because once I make all the files into a JAR theres only that Jar and I make a run.bat open that JAR and it says invalid or corrupted or something like that. I need to find out how to succesfully make it into a JAR can anyone help me? I am using a delta client - basically bluurs client.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 03, 2009, 01:34:35 am[/size][hr]Oh btw, when I try to open my jarred client here is what comes up: <img src="http://i27.tinypic.com/35ajiq1.png" alt width="" height="">[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 03, 2009, 12:54:35 pm[/size][hr]Oh btw, when I Jar it - it doesn’t show the GUI.</p>
