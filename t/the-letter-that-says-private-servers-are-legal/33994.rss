Greetings, Vigilant One. 

Firstly, allow me to make our stance on unofficial servers clear. 

Unofficial servers are not directly against the Rules of Service, however, as you may well know they often contain the very bare minimum of content - far behind the official servers by way of updates. 

They are also regularly very dangerous, and have been used in the past to both obtain account information and infect those who use them with a keylogging virus. This later leads to the loss of the users official RuneScape account. 

We at Jagex recommend very strongly against anyone using third party servers, indeed, it is something we cannot stress enough. 

However, when it comes to reporting these servers to us, we would be very grateful! We do try and keep track of all such servers, and make sure they are not causing undue harm to our players through malicious software of other nefarious means! 

Simply send as much information on the server as you can to us, and we shall investigate it from there. As always, we are very grateful to all reports, and thank you for helping us keep RuneScape a safer place for everyone. 

Keep up the good work! 

Yours Sincerely 
Mod Matt P</description>
