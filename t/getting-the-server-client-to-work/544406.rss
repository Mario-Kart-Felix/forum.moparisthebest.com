    <title>Getting the Server/client to work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-the-server-client-to-work/544406</link>
    <description>I&#39;m very nooby at this, I&#39;ve gotten a server and client up one time online.
I&#39;ve been trying to do it again recently and every server and client I try.. just is so difficult, I&#39;ve been trying to use mulitple guides since alot of them don&#39;t give 100% details.
I also haven&#39;t been able to find &quot;Server =&quot; on clients. and my complier and @run won&#39;t work... I&#39;m going to keep looking for a server/client that&#39;ll run fine. 
I&#39;ve made my no-ip, I think I portfowarded, and I also changed my Path and classpath.. But not sure if its 100% right. 
I&#39;m just so confused :/

But need help ASAP!!! 
Thanks!

              <p>you probably would want to start out with Easyrsc.  Look for a tutorial called “editing easyrsc” by Yong Min.  Another suggestion would be to first get it online by Localhost.</p>
