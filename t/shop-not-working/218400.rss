    <title>Shop not working?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shop-not-working/218400</link>
    <description>Why aren&#39;t any of my shops working anymore? They all worked 2 days ago now they won&#39;t.  Here is what some look like...
[code]else if (NPCID == 1552) { // lal santas holiday stuff
PutNPCCoords = true;
WanneShop = 31;
}
else if (NPCID == 2262) { // dark mage rbe shp
PutNPCCoords = true;
WanneShop = 32;
}
 else if (NPCID == 2253) { // Wise old man
PutNPCCoords = true;
WanneShop = 38;
 }[/code]

By the way it IS all under case 155: // first npc click.  And its not only that the shops aren&#39;t working, its none of the npcs that used to talk to you when u clicked on them work anymore.  And all the shops open up when u press shop emote so it&#39;s not the shops.  The error must be somewhere in case 155 but no compile errors.  Please help.</description>
