<p>I believe the p90x workout plan is amazing, IF you follow the diet plan. otherwise you may as well not do p90x at all.</p>
<p>My friend followed it to the letter, and no lie, in 90 days his body was RIPPED compared to before. He still has one of the craziest 8 packs I’ve seen.</p>

<p>Maybe your first priority should be sorting out your living situation, not the gym.[quote=“xxxtilllyxxx, post:55, topic:454594”]My dad won’t buy me anything, won’t help me write a resume, told me hes gonna get me a job where he works, hes just a lazy fuck who does nothing for me but keep me in a house and ground me for useless shit. OT I also play hockey at a high caliber level, does that contribute to the use of Creatine? I’m in the off season now, and it won’t start till around September/October.[/quote]<br>
Using creatine for hockey is fine I guess. Rather than asking “is creatine good for x sport”, determine how/what creatine does. If you’re looking for improvements in your stamina in game, creatine will most certainly not help. Correct me if I’m wrong, but is hand/forearm fatigue a problem in hockey? I imagine it would be, because you have to constantly be holding your hockey club.</p>
<p>Although it’s not the same, sports which usually involve the need to grip/twist/readjust hand movements on a club, are usually hampered by creatine. Again, like I said, although it’s not the same, I’d suggest you look up “Davi Millsaps creatine”. Basic low-down; Millsaps is a professional motocrosser who without his knowledge, his training supplements contained 1G of creatine, and it would cause him arm-pump (or, if you want to get technical, contributed to the quicker onset of “chronic exertional compartment syndrome” of his forearm muscles). How does this relate to hockey? Both sports require gripping for extended periods of time, with adjusting your hands repetitively - very different sports, but in this particular instance, very similar.</p>
<p>Hockey’s predominately an aerobic sport, no? Creatine’s not going to help stamina. Only thing it may help with in hockey, is if you used it in your off-season while resistance training, to assist in recovery/explosive training. You’re much better to use it in a meso cycle of anatomical adaption. However, if I was you, when developing a supplement stack for hockey, I’d be sure to include Beta Alanine in it. Very very very very cheap in bulk, very effective also.</p>

It’s very high in calories. From a quick glance at the profile, I’d say it’d be more suitable to bulking. This doesn’t help tone at all. If you want to be bigger and toned, best way to go about it is to bulk then tone. Put on the mass, then tone it. I’d use Cyto gainer while gaining mass, then using something like Iso-100 Pure, which is protein but with barely any calories, while toning.[/quote]All right, thanks man.  Now I’m going to look for a gym near me, then buy Cyto Gainer.</p>

<p>See, in your case, creatine is okay. For sporting athletes (minus perhaps bodybuilders), creatine really shouldn’t be used. The usage depends on the type of creatine. Creatine is really cheap, too - amazed you cannot afford it.</p>

<p>How about Cyto Gainer?</p>

</aside>
<p>Cytosports have been known to put heavy metals in their products. Copper, etc. Off the top of my head, Muscle Milk contained Arsenic 12.2 Cadmium: 5.6 and Lead: 13.5 Mercury. Levels which are NOT acceptable. Cytogainer as far as I’m aware/a quick google search would tell, does not have these problems. A quick glance at the ingredient profile, I didn’t see anything wrong with it - make sure you’re taking it for the right purposes though. Contrary to popular belief, protein doesn’t necessarily build muscle. It repairs it, your calorie macro will determine if you grow size by majority.</p>
<p>If it’s any condolences, I was sponsored by cytosports for 2 years. I wasn’t allowed to use their protein. I had to use their bottles and fill it with different protein.</p>

<p>^Okay, why?</p>

</aside>
<p>Creatine is a touchy subject. I study sports medicine and Creatine has a syllabus devoted entirely to it. Whether or not you choose to use it, or to avoid it, is entirely the persons choice. However, make sure you’ve researched and know EXACTLY what it is you’re doing. The people saying they have thrown up, probabbbbbbbbbbbly isn’t caused by creatine; though that’s it’s not possible to eliminate that as a cause; but it’s most likely because of the person tensing/forgetting to breath, starving their brain of oxygen - same effect if you hang upside down.</p>
<p>Anyway, regarding creatine - everytime you act against resistance (that is, in this situation, lift a weight) in your muscle, cells tear. Adenosine Triphosphate seperates, releasing heat and energy. This results in an electrical charge firing the muscle to tense (shorten), and it’s opposing muscle to lengthen. Take a bicep curl, when this happens, your bicep’s cells volumize and your bicep tenses, your triceps stretch. How does this relate to creatine?</p>
<p>Creatine is a natural occurring micro nutrient, but supplementation of creatine has been proven to increase the amount of creatine phosphate in the muscles. Now, when ATP seperates, the broken particle joins to a creatine phosphate cell, to recharge and reform an ATP cell - creatine supplementation aims to increase the amount of CP cells, making your recovery quicker.</p>
<p>It’s proven to shorten recovery. It’s ALSO proven to increase muscle hypertrophy (tearing of the fibres). However, it’s also proven to induce water retention, dehydration, and a few others. If you do take creatine, make sure it’s no more than 3g. Anymore, and you will excrete it/fuck your liver up after a while. Same with every type of supplement - use them to meet your macros, NOT TO BUILD MUSCLE. If you need assistance to meet your protein requirements, USE A PROTEIN SHAKE. If you can make it - DO NOT USE A PROTEIN SHAKE; YOU WILL JUST EXCRETE IT + ELEVATE YOUR BLOOD GLUCOSE (not a good thing if you’re not hypoglycemic) etc etc etc</p>
<p>That’s the basics of creatine, if you want advice on what type to use/how to use it, I’d be happy to assist. There’s nothing to say you shouldn’t use it, yet, but there’s also nothing to suggest to use it.</p>
<p>ps I always like to use a famous Ronnie Coleman quote when idiots try to tell me their supplements are needed to build muscle.<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">“Everybody wanna be a body builder, but nobody wanna lift some heavy ass weights.”</span> - Ronnie Coleman, 8x Mr Olympia</p>

Don’t drink protein shakes, supplements, or any of that crap. You will do yourself a much bigger favour by getting your nutrients through proper diet.</p>
<p>And chances are you’re not a profesional body builder, just lift some weights and try different exercises lol, and eat right(and lots!), and you will get the results<br>
