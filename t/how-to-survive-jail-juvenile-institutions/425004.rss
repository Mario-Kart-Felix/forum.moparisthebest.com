    <title>How to survive jail! (Juvenile Institutions)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-survive-jail-juvenile-institutions/425004</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve done a few lengthy stays inside a few juvenile centers, and if you ever find yourself in a position before your getting arrested thinking, how am I going to survive 6 months? Look no further because you&#39;ve found the guide for you!

So a couple things to keep in mind;
Juvenile records in some states are civil therefore do not carry minimum or maximum punishments. This also means that this is like getting sued, and therefore will not necessarily show up on your record, but it can be seen by the State and Federal authorities.
Prosecutors have the right [b][u]TO WAIVE YOUR CHARGES TO ADULT COURT AT ANYTIME.[/u][/b] this could be bad, you WILL be looking at years and not months. You will be sitting in protective custody until 18, but you&#39;ll be getting hoed after you get out.
Sex Crimes, like SUV says, are considered extremely heinous to both your peers and adults alike, you will be sent to an institution that is equipped to handle your kind and it can be a breeze or your worst nightmare.

Now to surviving,
Identify which sentence you have! (These are just a few, may vary) 

Jails are setup in either level systems, determined sentences or time served.
Level system you gain a level every 28 days until you get to a certain level to be released. Any bad behavior is written up and can hold you up to 72 days maximum.
Determined Sentences are made by judges/prosecutors you are to do a fixed amount of time and be released, if you fuck up, it doesn&#39;t matter, your gonna get out when your time is up. This is not like adult jail because you will never be eligible for parole until the end.
Time served is a concept of you going into jail, them defining your criminogenic needs and you get a fixed time from the institution. You can fuck up, and be held for much longer than a level system hold.

You will be assigned a counselor, you job is to do your very best to impress (not be overly nice) him/her. Act sincere and well-rounded at all times.

Your peers is a matter of debate. Depending on who you hang with on the outside of jail, reflects who you will on the inside. Your personality will attract friends of the same group you associate yourself with. This important to remember, you can act like something you not.
There will always be someone to challenge you no matter where you go, someone will not like your, or in a serious case, a lot of people won&#39;t like you. This is where you have to adapt/do things to gain respect/trust.

If people are threatening you, or acting like your not anything then you have to assert yourself, this can be arguing or fighting, from the beginning you must let people know, you don&#39;t mess around.

Never give anyone (but your friends) anything! Food or clothes alike, if they&#39;re asking for your stuff or telling you to give it to them, they think your a (Dead, debt, ded) dog. Means someone you can get stuff from cuz they&#39;re scared.

If people are still being dicks, and you haven&#39;t given up food or gotten into a fight, you might want to join a &quot;gang&quot;. Now this sounds harsh, but find the biggest &quot;gang&quot; in the jail, and attempt to join it. Hang around members and ask the highest ranking one how to join. Normally, they will put you on and ask you to do stupid shit but I only recommend this is nothing is working and you&#39;ve given up all hope. *gangs in jail are real street gangs, but alot of people who claim don&#39;t claim outside of jail making them not real. you can be called out on this and be called a send off or fake.

Dropping the soap in juvenile jails, doesn&#39;t do anything. You probably won&#39;t want to pick it up though.

Time will never go by fast, try to do what you can to keep yourself occupied.

If you don&#39;t have a good amount of credits this is the time to catch up, school is easier than normal and teachers are lenient.

Don&#39;t bet unless you can win.

Ask to clean/do work for extra things.

Act your own race. (this is the one thing you can&#39;t fake)

Respect is a big thing, do not challenge other peoples unless you really want to fight.

Words such as bitch, hoe, hook, blueberry, brick, corn, jello, crab, eight-o-eight, fruitcake, rollerblades, slob (many more) are gang words, calling or even saying any of these words can be instantly bad, depending on how the person looks at them.

Don&#39;t get other people to do your dirty work.

Jail is not and will never be like it is on TV, the episode of House that I saw named &quot;Twenty-Vicodins&quot; is in my opinion the most accurate description. Locked up and those shows are REAL jails but they use good people (usually).

Those are it for now, If I remember anything else I&#39;ll post.

Any questions you can feel free to ask.

I&#39;m spent for now.</description>

              <p>So I’ve done a few lengthy stays inside a few juvenile centers, and if you ever find yourself in a position before your getting arrested thinking, how am I going to survive 6 months? Look no further because you’ve found the guide for you!</p>
<p>So a couple things to keep in mind;<br>
Juvenile records in some states are civil therefore do not carry minimum or maximum punishments. This also means that this is like getting sued, and therefore will not necessarily show up on your record, but it can be seen by the State and Federal authorities.<br>
Prosecutors have the right <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">TO WAIVE YOUR CHARGES TO ADULT COURT AT ANYTIME.</span></span> this could be bad, you WILL be looking at years and not months. You will be sitting in protective custody until 18, but you’ll be getting hoed after you get out.<br>
Sex Crimes, like SUV says, are considered extremely heinous to both your peers and adults alike, you will be sent to an institution that is equipped to handle your kind and it can be a breeze or your worst nightmare.</p>
<p>Now to surviving,<br>
Identify which sentence you have! (These are just a few, may vary)</p>
<p>Jails are setup in either level systems, determined sentences or time served.<br>
Level system you gain a level every 28 days until you get to a certain level to be released. Any bad behavior is written up and can hold you up to 72 days maximum.<br>
Determined Sentences are made by judges/prosecutors you are to do a fixed amount of time and be released, if you fuck up, it doesn’t matter, your gonna get out when your time is up. This is not like adult jail because you will never be eligible for parole until the end.<br>
Time served is a concept of you going into jail, them defining your criminogenic needs and you get a fixed time from the institution. You can fuck up, and be held for much longer than a level system hold.</p>
<p>You will be assigned a counselor, you job is to do your very best to impress (not be overly nice) him/her. Act sincere and well-rounded at all times.</p>
<p>Your peers is a matter of debate. Depending on who you hang with on the outside of jail, reflects who you will on the inside. Your personality will attract friends of the same group you associate yourself with. This important to remember, you can act like something you not.<br>
There will always be someone to challenge you no matter where you go, someone will not like your, or in a serious case, a lot of people won’t like you. This is where you have to adapt/do things to gain respect/trust.</p>
<p>If people are threatening you, or acting like your not anything then you have to assert yourself, this can be arguing or fighting, from the beginning you must let people know, you don’t mess around.</p>
<p>Never give anyone (but your friends) anything! Food or clothes alike, if they’re asking for your stuff or telling you to give it to them, they think your a (Dead, debt, ded) dog. Means someone you can get stuff from cuz they’re scared.</p>
<p>If people are still being dicks, and you haven’t given up food or gotten into a fight, you might want to join a “gang”. Now this sounds harsh, but find the biggest “gang” in the jail, and attempt to join it. Hang around members and ask the highest ranking one how to join. Normally, they will put you on and ask you to do stupid shit but I only recommend this is nothing is working and you’ve given up all hope. *gangs in jail are real street gangs, but alot of people who claim don’t claim outside of jail making them not real. you can be called out on this and be called a send off or fake.</p>
<p>Dropping the soap in juvenile jails, doesn’t do anything. You probably won’t want to pick it up though.</p>
<p>Time will never go by fast, try to do what you can to keep yourself occupied.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a good amount of credits this is the time to catch up, school is easier than normal and teachers are lenient.</p>
<p>Don’t bet unless you can win.</p>
<p>Ask to clean/do work for extra things.</p>
<p>Act your own race. (this is the one thing you can’t fake)</p>
<p>Respect is a big thing, do not challenge other peoples unless you really want to fight.</p>
<p>Words such as bitch, hoe, hook, blueberry, brick, corn, jello, crab, eight-o-eight, fruitcake, rollerblades, slob (many more) are gang words, calling or even saying any of these words can be instantly bad, depending on how the person looks at them.</p>
<p>Don’t get other people to do your dirty work.</p>
<p>Jail is not and will never be like it is on TV, the episode of House that I saw named “Twenty-Vicodins” is in my opinion the most accurate description. Locked up and those shows are REAL jails but they use good people (usually).</p>
<p>Those are it for now, If I remember anything else I’ll post.</p>
<p>Any questions you can feel free to ask.</p>
<p>I’m spent for now.</p>
