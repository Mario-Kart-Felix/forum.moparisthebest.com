    <title>Help with silabs, not working</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-silabs-not-working/169111</link>
    <description>Hi everyone,

I recently made my own server and really want a silabs one but everyone time I type in http://client.silabsoft.org/ or http://silabsoft.org it comes up with this error:

Forbidden
You don&#39;t have permission to access / on this server.

Additionally, a 403 Forbidden error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apache/1.3.37 Server at client.silabsoft.org Port 80

How can I fix this because I would ask this question on silabsoft forums but I can&#39;t go there either, same error.

Can anyone help? Thanks.</description>
