    <description>This Topic can be used as help for others aswell as solving a small problem for myself.
Alright So I decided to see about making a sort of &quot;More&quot; feature for the Deltascape Teleports Inferface

Ok, the &quot;more&quot; feature merely takes you to a duplicate of the first interface, but containing different Teleports.

I have done all the teleports and interfaces already here is what I did..


&lt;blockquote&gt;case 6004: // Moster Teleport
    c.sendQuest(&quot;Rock crabs&quot;, 15240);
    c.sendQuest(&quot;Island&quot;, 15241);
    c.sendQuest(&quot;More&quot;, 15239);
    c.sendQuest(&quot;Cave&quot;, 15243);
    c.sendQuest(&quot;Slayer tower&quot;, 15242);
    c.setSidebarInterface(6, 3209); // magic tab (ancient = 12855)
    c.interfaceGame = 1;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is the first interface as shown in the picture, On click the &quot;more&quot; feature takes you to this, unfortunately due to my problem, I cannot show a picture but I can assure you for certain the interface works fine...

&lt;blockquote&gt;case 59135:
if(c.interfaceGame == 1)
    c.sendQuest(&quot;Dagg lair&quot;, 15240);
    c.sendQuest(&quot;KBD&quot;, 15241);
    c.sendQuest(&quot;More&quot;, 15239);
    c.sendQuest(&quot;Kalphite Queen&quot;, 15243);
    c.sendQuest(&quot;Giant Mole&quot;, 15242);
    c.setSidebarInterface(6, 3209); // magic tab (ancient = 12855)
    c.interfaceGame = 3;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now there is another interface that will come after that aswell.. but its not necesary for what I need the help with.

The teleports link up fine, so yes as you press the interface button, you are teleport to the necesary place

&lt;blockquote&gt;case 59136:
c.triggerTele(3564, 3288, 0);
if(c.interfaceGame == 3)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ok, but!! I was wondering if, or what the code is for a sort of &quot;break&quot; if you will. If you say it has something to do with the Break; at the end of each case. I have already tried adding it in but as predicted, compile errors as the break; needs to be at the end of the case, hence ending the case there, but I have more than just that interface so I cant put a break; after, or it will remove the following from that case therefore causing errors. Well what currently happens, is.. as you click the &quot;More&quot; button it will take you to the next interface, but in doing so teleporting you to place that the second interfaces middle button is meant to. 
I merely want to know whether there is something I need to add to pause it on the second interface to allow the player to choose out of the buttons on the second interface.
