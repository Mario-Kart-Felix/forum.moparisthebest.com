    <title>Who also have very bad days?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/who-also-have-very-bad-days/357826</link>
    <description>Today was TERRIBLE for me.


1. I didn&#39;t know if i had to take my bicycle to school, the teacher wasn&#39;t clear and i almost had to cry (don&#39;t say WTF, i&#39;m just 11 years old and it is just my first week on my secondary school)

2. Guess what? I had to take it. I had to sit behind someone and then half the way PATS, i fell on the ground, hard, on my knees.

3. We came back at school, everything was great, so this point no problem.

4. The pause was gone HORRIBLE. Everything was like messed up, lost at wich local i had to go, then, gladly, i could find someone who is in my class.

5. I lost my book, i was sarching everywhere, crying :&#39;(, i had to go back to my school, nothing found =S.

Well, that was just one HORRIBLE day. Also somebody who had very bad days?</description>

<p>It can be you’re depress, but it also might not mean you have depression, you can try to kill your self because some huge event happened, but unless you continue to be in that state of mind your not depressed, depression continues it doesn’t just stop, Ive had thoughts about killing my self and killing other people, but I just think it through and, and think of what would be if I did such a thing, then a few hours later I am better.</p>

<p>No, just no, not everyone has depression, just because your sad doesn’t mean it is depression its called an emotion for a reason, depression is when your over come with sadness, emptiness, etc,  it is more then just being sad for a few hours to a few days, depression is 27/7 365 days., it will never go away it is always with you. You don’t just say I am depressed when your sad, when your depressed you’re more then just sad more then just not loving life for a little while, it keeps going and going until something finally gives.</p>

<p>Every one has felt depression, which is why I said that. I did word it wrong, I don’t mean every one actually does have it.</p>
