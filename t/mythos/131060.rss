Anybody ever hear about this game? I read about it in Game Informer it looks awesome! For the people who don&#39;t know about it its like a Diablo clone. Its in public beta testing now if you wanna check it out. I can&#39;t wait for the release! Sadly it hasn&#39;t been announced yet. But it has to be close since its in beta testing.</description>
