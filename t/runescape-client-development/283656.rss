    <description>[b]Introduction[/b]
Some of you may know me from some previous project I have done, most of them are finished now and I have released every single one of them. 
So far, runescape private servers are starting to bore me, although the servers are the clients seems to interest me for some reason. I have been doing some research into this and I found that most of the runescape client are terribly coded and are totally messed up.

[b]Information[/b]
I have started development a new client using MITB&#39;s 317 deob and I have made some progress from there, hopefully I will be creating this, along with adding a lot of features for this community to start using.
I will be adding a lot of the &quot;new&quot; runescape models into this client.


[b]Features[/b]

[ul][li]Can add items without damaging the cache[/li]
[li]508 Look[/li]
[li]Fixed chatbox[/li][/ul]


I am looking to add a lot more to this client, this is all I have completed yet, pictures will be coming soon after I have my dinner.</description>

              <p>Sounds like its going to be fantastic. Can’t you just do model preloading? Also if you can make it have the 317 login thingy but its  a 500+ cache that u can keep adding new cache into that would be MEAN!!!</p>
