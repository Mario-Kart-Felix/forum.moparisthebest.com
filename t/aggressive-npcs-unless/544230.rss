    <description>Hey there...

I am trying to sort out the Black knights about the aggressiveness of them. Now what I am trying to do is that if a person equips Full black armour including Black Boots and weapon (Black Kitshield optional) the Black knights will not attack them but if they don&#39;t have any of them or just wear part of it (Just say Platebody or something like that) they will attack them.

I am doing this because I am giving better drops for the Black knights so it is harder for the player to kill the knights because they will all be hitting the player (because of multi combat).

Is there a code in which I can do this?

I am also trying to do this with the White Knights as well.</description>

              <p>Well there’s a way to make it where you have to have all black armor on in order to get drops from black knights/white for white knights, as for them being aggressive based on what you’re wearing, that I’m not sure on.</p>
