    <title>GUI to Applet</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/gui-to-applet/20356</link>
    <description>I was wondering if it is very difficult to convert a java gui to a java applet.

Originally, the program I was creating was supposed to be a standalone app with a gui.  I&#39;ve been thinking this through, and decided that it would be better to create the program as a applet and host it on a website.  

I&#39;ve never really worked extensively with applets and just had one main question.  How do I make my interface into an applet?
Do I just have to create an instance of JApplet, then add all of my components and containers to that?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.</description>

              <p>java gui and java applet are completly different. Do you mean JFrame and JApplet? JFrame to JApplet = piece of cake.</p>
<p>make it extend JApplet and add all the methods (init, paint, start, stop, some more i think), and in init() put the gui adding part and instead of adding to the jframe (or this) add to this.</p>
