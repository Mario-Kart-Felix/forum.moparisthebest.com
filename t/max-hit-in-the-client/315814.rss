[/quote]</p>
<p>theres nothing from with sending 500 packets, as long as people are not on dialup these days. I was talking about the specific problem RSCD has with handling, anywhere over 40 or so people in 1 area, people get randomly kicked off/lagged out, all kinds of crazy stuff happens.</p>
<p>Just to clarify, this is a problem that applies to all online games, not just RSC. If a 1 player sends an appearance update to an area containing 500 players, 500 message will have to be sent. There is simply no way around that (although there are strategies to deal with it).[/quote]</p>

<p>These forums are based around RSC, this subforum is based around development. some people are on far different playing fields than others, therefore are not equal in this situation. However that does not mean ‘hey im a pro coder, means im better than you in real life, and everything else you do’ it just means in this situation.</p>

<p>Also 80 players logging in at the same time is completely fine, it’s not a write speed issue since logging in only has to read, and barely write.</p>
<p>These forums have gone to shit, nobody does anything worth looking at, theres next to no talent to do anything worth looking at in these forums. I’ve moved on and barely visit these forums anymore as it’s the same old shit (RS2 noobs advertising their lame forums, Jessekins trolling, someone releasing something crappy that takes a minute or people advertising their <span class="bbcode-b">new</span> servers for the 5th time)</p>
<p>Unfortunately i don’t even think I’ve seen anything interesting in the last year or so on these forums.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know, i’m not with RSCAngel anymore other than the community, i’m out of the whole RSC scene as theres really nothing left in it.</p>

              <blockquote>You've been through the same problems? I don't think you did. It was a host issue that caused the server to disconnect AND not let anyone connect at complete random. Sometimes it would work for 2 days solid, other times it would drop 10 minutes after starting it.</blockquote>
<p>So this is a problem only YOU can have? Nice defense? I mean really. I’ve hosted with 5 providers, 4 of which I had nothing but problems.</p>
<blockquote>So tell me, what would you do in that situation? I've run base RSCD as a test and it has the same problem. Solve the issue and I'll believe you, but until then you are in no position to put me down as there's very, very few people on here who could solve it IMO.</blockquote>
<p>So again, you’re consulting others for help because you yourself cannot solve the problem, but I’m the bad administrator? Really dude? Get your argument straight.<br>
Oh I’d be glad to help you, I really would, but I seem to remember back on RealPK when you had that kid exploit it, then offered to help but never did.<br>
You might think, well he’s not helping me or proving himself so he must not know what to do. Oh on the contrary, I have the right, and I <span class="bbcode-b">am</span> right for saying no to help you, for the simple fact that you refused to help me, and lets not forget the fact that you are no one I need to prove myself to.</p>
<p>I suggest you go back and read a little bit more carefully, xa0sluke. As I clearly said, you’re acting as if it was a job.<br>
Oh it’s a learning curve to you? How much did <span class="bbcode-b">you</span> actually learn in the duration of this project? Something worth mentioning, and something that you figured out on your own, not what people are helping you with (insert laugh here).</p>
<p>I have my reasons for saying 2 months. As I said previously, I have school and other projects, plus not to mention a out-of-state job that I will be starting Monday bright and early. Yes, it’s easy for YOU to say something like that, because clearly, it will be a lie. When I say something, I’m never bluffing.</p>

              <p>Are you talking about RealPK? Where did you see my name on the owners list? RSCPK is mine, which you should be focusing on criticizing, but then again you really can’t, because I’ve been through the same problems and it didn’t take that long to figure out those problems.</p>
<p>By the way, kid, bringing member count in an irrelevant subject, what are you doing? No one cares about member count in this topic. This topic is about java code, and that only. Your pathetic excuse for a server only, and I mean <span class="bbcode-b">ONLY</span> blew up because ProjectP2P went down right when yours went up. NOT TO MENTION you having some kid exploit other servers to advertise your server.</p>
<p>Yeah true, I canceled RealPK because of the exploit - Explain to me why that would make me a bad administrator? Oh wait, I wasn’t the administrator on RealPK was I? Oh damn, you must have misunderstood - Your fault. I was only the source provider. If there was something he wanted coded in, I would do so - on my time. RealPK wasn’t mine, and it was highly foolish of you to think so, and it was highly foolish of you to bring it to an argument, when in fact you know NOTHING of what you speak.</p>
<p>In any case, it was a 1 man team (me). Juggling school, my other projects which had more priority than RealPK and RealPK itself, I’m not wasting my time on some little SQL injection.</p>
<p>You have to remember, kid, RealPK was a <span class="bbcode-b">PROJECT</span>. Not a job, which is what you’re making it out to be.</p>
<p>Now, please respond back quickly with some more random bullshit junk that comes out your mouth, so I can shut it, again, for you.</p>
<p>Edit: Give me about 2 months to get my shit together. I got something better than “RSCE”.</p>
