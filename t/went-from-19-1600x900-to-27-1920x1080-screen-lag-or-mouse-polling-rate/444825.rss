    <description>The monitor is 60hz and its the same brand as my old monitor which had excellent colors and it was very smooth. But now when I play games even 60 fps doesn&#39;t feel as smooth. The monitor has a 2ms draw time which is pretty fucking fast.

Could this be an issue with my mouse being a bit too sensitive for such a big area? Or could my mouse (polling rate?) be slower on this shitty mouse and more noticeable on a big screen? Could it be more touchy now? I understand that adding 30k more pixels can slow my fps down, but I even lowered a few settings to keep it at 60 fps and I can&#39;t tell if its the monitor or my view panning across a more complex/busy area.</description>

<p>Before 60 fps didnt even look like 60 fps because my mouse didnt update fast enough when I turned/aimed</p>
