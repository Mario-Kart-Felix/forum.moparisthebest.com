              <p>[quote=“xxxxxx 13, post:2, topic:383184”]Nope. Right section.</p>
<p>Ok it could be a few things. Are you positive that your server is running on the correct port? I assume it probably is.</p>
<p>Are you sure its open? What kind of router do you have?</p>
<p>Also, this may sound stupid. But have you tried turning off windows firewall? Even with the exception sometimes it can block the transfer. My windows vista had the exception but i still had to turn off the firewall to run my server. It honestly won’t effect anything on your computer if you turn it off.[/quote]</p>
<p>I haven’t used my windows firewall in ages, its actually broken lmao. It cant update itself, and cant even connect to the windows server, so i had to shut it off otherwise it wouldn’t stop bugging me about its problems. I’m using an edition of mcafee that I’ve had for a long time now. but i don’t think thats it.<br>
As for the router, Its a net-gear, what ever comcast sent us lol. i was going to port-forward it, but last time i tried i broke a 100$ router and didn’t want to do that again lol<br>
And yes, my server has all the correct data entered for port and all that.<br>
I’ve tried using port 5555 and it says:<br>
Error: I could not see your service on 67.190.47.33 on port (5555)<br>
Reason: Connection timed out<br>
And then i get this when i use port 43594:<br>
Error: I could not see your service on 67.190.47.33 on port (43594)<br>
Reason: Connection timed out</p>
