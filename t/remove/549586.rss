<p>I’ve showed plenty of support to “moparscapes members” and helped more of them than your pretty little brain can count to, I’ve put days upon days of my time into helping this site and its members you little tosspot. YOU came here claiming something was unique, it wasn’t, I told you, YOU flipped out. Don’t sit here and call me the brat for you spitting the dummy when someone told you the hour it took to rip tutorial island from another source wasn’t unique or special (shock, amirite).</p>
<p>Don’t try and show off something that’s nothing special if you can’t handle someone telling you it isn’t.</p>

<p>Naseem is right. While Ruby can go overboard on his opinion on things, you would have gotten similar (maybe not as harsh, maybe worse?) from other members eventually. Realistically, you only showed off something that has been done over, and over, and over.<br>
It’s like when a new social network is created. Does anyone really notice? No, because it’s nothing new. And the people that do notice will notice exactly that. You have to do something <span class="bbcode-i">different</span> with what already exists. Again, going back to the social network reference, think of facebook. Everyone thought it was stupid and shit when it was first made. But look at it now, it has literally killed myspace. It’s previous competitor.</p>
<p>You have to learn to take feedback of all sorts.<br>
The good, the bad, the garbage, the shit, all of it. You just gotta take it like you’re the newbie in prison.</p>

<p>It’s okay calm down, He just shared his opinion and thought that your showoff was not worthy of showing off and you just overreacted.<br>
And he has a point though, Try to work a little harder maybe and show your results after.</p>

Except it isn’t unique in the slightest. Just because you’ve ripped the tutorial island from a remake doesn’t make it unique.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m still adding updates to it, come and and have a look you will see what i mean, i still have to upload many more videos to this thread thank’s. Just because you saw my video doesn’t mean to go and judge the whole server. NO, so maybe next time you should do some more research.[/quote]</p>
<p>how is he supposed to do more “research” if you absolutely wrote nothing on the thread but just put one video?</p>
