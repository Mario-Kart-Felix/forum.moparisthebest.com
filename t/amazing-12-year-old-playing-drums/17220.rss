Yeah, I am sure… It really isn’t that hard. Everyone see’s a good drummer as to how fast he can do double bass. I’ve got news for you, double bass is super easy! Now, I would love to see that kid (even though he is an adult now) create his own album in a band. That is talent right there, any person who can <span class="bbcode-u">create</span> good music is way better then someone who can <span class="bbcode-u">play</span> other peoples good music.</p>
