    <description>I also asked this on rune server.. and have tried google on several occasions.. even been messing with it for two days trying to figure it out..

I&#39;m trying to make a class call on a statement in two separate instances.. So I&#39;m wondering if there is a way that you can stop it from calling both at the same time. and instead have it call one. break the chain and when you use the other instance it will use it without trying to incorporate the other statement..Can anyone offer me any assistance with this?</description>
