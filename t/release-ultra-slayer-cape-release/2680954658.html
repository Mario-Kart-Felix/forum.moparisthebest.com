Yes, I understand that you want modeling to progress more, but that doesn’t mean you can bash everyone that is new to this and is proud of what little things they can do. I myself have the modeling skills of a retard with a crayon and no paper. SO…I couldn’t even do THAT. Let alone make anything from scratch that doesn’t look like a cardboard sword. As far as the gravedigging, this came up on a search thing. If everytime someone ask for help they get the “Use the search button noob.” as a half ass lazy answer, “gravedigging” will continue.[/quote]<br>
If we bash people enough then they will learn. Every succesful modeller here, including myself,has been bashed and we have all learned. It really does make a difference.<br>
If you have retarded skills, then please learn. Dont defend crappy skills because that is helping no one. It is actually causing harm because you are rewarding people for their shitty models.<br>
Also, there is such thing as DATES. Look at the date before posting something completely useless. Its fine if the opic is a couple days old at most, but anything past that and you will be flamed.</p>
<p>Hey, dont call us “half-ass” and “lazy”. You are the half-asses lazy motherfucker for not using the search bar in the first place. Instead, you dump your problems on us. We have MUCH better things to do besides sparing usefull seconds of our time to do you work. Dont call us lazy when you are the one asking asking retarded questions that you can damn well figure out for yourself, no matter what skill level you are.</p>

This is the last thing I am putting towards this. Constantly putting people down about there work will get nowhere. If you at least let it be known that you acknowledged of there trying then that will motivate them to do beter. Yes, constuctive critisism will help, but telling them their stuff sucks will just make them want to give up. The whole “rewarding for the shitty models” thing is a load of shit. They had to of put some form of effort into making it. I’m not rewarding any one for shitty a shitty model, I’m rewarding him for at least trying. Something that I fail at. PLUS! This item is based on consept, not modeling skill.</p>
<blockquote>Look at the date before posting something completely useless. Its fine if the opic is a couple days old at most, but anything past that and you will be flamed.</blockquote>
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot to be perfect in every way like you are. I'm preaty sure flaming is what started this whole thing. What, a second flame make the other just go awy? I'm 99.99% sure that it will just cause little never ending squables like this.
<p>Also, you are calling me lazy for “not using the search bar”?! How the hell did you think I found this old topic anyway?</p>
<blockquote>As far as the gravedigging, this came up on a search thing. If everytime someone ask for help they get the "Use the search button noob." as a half ass lazy answer, "gravedigging" will continue.</blockquote>
I'm thinking that you're preaty lazy and need to read the entire post not just scim through it and admedietly start freaking out. Yes, my spelling does suck. Plus, I posted one thing asking for help that I later found out by myself anyway. So, by asking one thing about coding, I'm duping everything on you? That's funny because I dought you even read that topic, and you are going to acuse me of "dumping everything on you." Just end the conversation. There is no need to continue to quote and bicker back and forth.
<p>AND, since I can garantee that you will post a rebuttle calling me a noob for ending this, and declare “victory”, just don’t bother. You’ll only be making yourself look like an ass. Once again, all RuneScape Private servers are leeched off of RuneScape. Why the hell would they be called RUNESCAPE Private Servers. The original idea is the same. If you own a server, idc you ARE a leecher in some way, unless you remove all likenesses it is leeched. Don’t even try to argue with that, that is the smartest thing I’ve said on these forums so far. OK, now you can flame, I know you will.</p>

<p>Look at the date before posting something completely useless. Its fine if the opic is a couple days old at most, but anything past that and you will be flamed.</p>

<p>Oh, I’m sorry, I forgot to be perfect in every way like you are. I’m preaty sure flaming is what started this whole thing. What, a second flame make the other just go awy? I’m 99.99% sure that it will just cause little never ending squables like this.</p>
<p>Also, you are calling me lazy for “not using the search bar”?! How the hell did you think I found this old topic anyway?</p>

<p>As far as the gravedigging, this came up on a search thing. If everytime someone ask for help they get the “Use the search button noob.” as a half ass lazy answer, “gravedigging” will continue.</p>

<p>I’m thinking that you’re preaty lazy and need to read the entire post not just scim through it and admedietly start freaking out. Yes, my spelling does suck. Plus, I posted one thing asking for help that I later found out by myself anyway. So, by asking one thing about coding, I’m duping everything on you? That’s funny because I dought you even read that topic, and you are going to acuse me of “dumping everything on you.” Just end the conversation. There is no need to continue to quote and bicker back and forth.</p>
<p>AND, since I can garantee that you will post a rebuttle calling me a noob for ending this, and declare “victory”, just don’t bother. You’ll only be making yourself look like an ass. Once again, all RuneScape Private servers are leeched off of RuneScape. Why the hell would they be called RUNESCAPE Private Servers. The original idea is the same. If you own a server, idc you ARE a leecher in some way, unless you remove all likenesses it is leeched. Don’t even try to argue with that, that is the smartest thing I’ve said on these forums so far. OK, now you can flame, I know you will.[/quote]<br>
Its not like this guy knows i have not told him this before. I once told him that i will put him down untill he makes an item from scratch. So i will continue untill he does. And you didn’t know that because you are someone very inactive in these parts of the forums.</p>
<p>If you have looked in ANY recent post on this section, its a gravedigg or a flame for gravedigging. You should have learned by now. EVERYONE should have learned by now. And i will continue to point out gracedigging untill it gets into their minds that its a stupid bullshit thing to do.</p>
<p>The “dumping everything on US” is an exaggeration you dipshit. Of course you asked US only one little thing about coding. But did you figure out how to do it by yourself? Yes. Did you NEED to post a topic about it?! No.  Im calling you “half-assed” and “lazy” for expecting US to figure out something you cant do on your own.</p>
<p>Dude dont end this conversation. Its a good debate. I dont declare victory untill someone gives up, in which i drop it. Also, we are not talking about RSPSs right now. They have special protection that keeps them from being sued and taken down. Not models. Jagex can come in here and get the IP of the leecher and sue them if they have the half mind of doing so. So when that does happen, and you are begging for change on the street because Jagex sued you for millions for “slightly edditing” a model and making it “yours”, dont come crying to us.</p>

That is why if I do, which I probaly wont, edit one of jagex's models, I will give them most, if not all of the credit for the model. I would state "This is jagex's model that I edited." If Jagex honestly resorts to sueing kids for using somthing they made, that is sad. It's bad enough that they try to shove membership down everyones throught. Jagex is pethetic if they honestly think they will get anywhere sueing teens and kids that are just trying to have fun. I can understand if someone is useing one of their models to make money, but kids just having fun..that is so sad it's not even funny. The whole begging for change on the streets made me laugh though...well I need to go be a "leecher" and add more ints and models to the source im using "not mine"...HAPPY PEOPLE WHO BITCH ABOUT LEEHING? I EVEN SAID IT IS NOT MINE! Also, yes I was being lazy for posting for help instead of just testing first like i should of. I am mature enough to admit i was wrong, unlike over half of the people who bitch for stuff on here.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: July 17, 2009, 08:03:09 pm[/size][hr][quote="Setsuna, post:1, topic:268095"]-
