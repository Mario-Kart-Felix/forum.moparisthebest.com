    <description>Who is ready to learn how to Ollie... I bet you are.


Ok by now you have a nice board setup and are ready to learn this trick.
Description: This is the trick that allows you to jump in the air with the board without using your hands.

The ollie is the most important trick you will ever learn in skateboarding so practice.

Feet Position
--------------
This is the first step you want to know where to puts your feet if your goofy put your leading foot up in the middle of your board and your back in the middle of the tail and same thing if you are regular footed except your feet are in switched position. To understand what I mean I&#39;m go to put some visual aid.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yPsQyI1CAc
This video will help you out with something you might not understand in this guide.

The Ollie
~~~~~~~\

Ok now for the time you all have been waiting for you have your stance ready and your eager to learn how to ollie. The first thing you want to do is get into goofy position if your goofy and regular if your regular.(I recommend that you learn this trick stationary before you learn it moving unless your daring.) Ok now your gonna want to slap down on your tail, and jump up as soon as you slap down on the tail and slide your front foot up the board and stop at the nose.
When you are at the peek of your ollie level out your board push down with your feet and brace for impact.

When you land this trick along with any other trick scream shout or whatever else you want pat your self on the back. just have fun with this if your not skateboarding for fun or the love of it then your gonna have a bad time so don&#39;t skateboard just because everyone else is. You gotta love doing what you do and if you do good luck to you.

Things that could go wrong
------------------------------
There aren&#39;t too many thing that could go wrong when doing this trick.

(If you do not have your feet on the board just right anything that can go wrong will go wrong but here are some examples of what can happen)

1. when you ollie you move off of your board somehow(sometimes happens when your excited that you got into the air) and you land with one foot off and the other on the tail and the board comes up and hits you, if your a guy it a lot of the times hits your nuts, but girls you don&#39;t have to worry about that.

2. You don&#39;t get in the air. This can be fixed by watching yourself when you ollie, if you see that your not getting any air this can be fixed by jumping as high as you can and dragging your foot hard up the path of the board and evening out. If this does not work practice your ollie motion off the board and see how high your vertical jumps are so you don&#39;t get mad at yourself and throw the board.

3. If you try this trick moving the main things that could go wrong are you land while leaning back and your board comes out from under you and you fall. (You will fall but because you fall a lot don&#39;t give up Just practice practice practice your going to hear that a lot when you learn new tricks.

4. If not done appropriately Nothing will go wrong.

Closing
~~~~~~
If you have to work for your tricks like I don&#39;t that just makes it ten times more enjoyable when you land the trick so again don&#39;t give up just practice. Have fun with it, but don&#39;t throw your board.
Throwing your board leads to many damages in your board which will lead to you getting hurt

Warning: If you get hurt in anyway from this guide I am in no way responsible. learn this trick at your own risk. By reading this warning I am not liable for you getting hurt.



GOOD LUCK AND HAVE FUN!!!!!

So if we don't read the warning we can sue you? :P
<p>Back on topic, I have never wanted to board or get on anything with wheels for that matter (except bikes :P). I can stand on a board for about 3 seconds before bashing my elbow into the asphalt <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
