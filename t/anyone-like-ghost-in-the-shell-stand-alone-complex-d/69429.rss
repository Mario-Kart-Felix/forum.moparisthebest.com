    <title>Anyone like Ghost in the Shell - Stand Alone Complex? :D</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-like-ghost-in-the-shell-stand-alone-complex-d/69429</link>
    <description>(Soz if this should go in the reviews/writing section, but it didn&#39;t seem like it to me...)

I found episodes 7-19 on peekvid.com, but they look more like episodes 30+ to me...

http://peekvid.com/feature/anime/485/Ghost-In-The-Shell-:-Stand-Alone-Complex.html

(For some reason when I was watching it, even though it had the entire thing it cut off and went to another episode)

Also, does anyone watch it on adult swim or on cutting edge on demand channel 860? Pwnage :D</description>
