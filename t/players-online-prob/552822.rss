    <description>Okay, so on my Rsps Server, there is a problem where in the top of quest tab and even when doing the command ::players, it shows double the amount of players.
-For example, there are 3 players online, it would double it making it say there are 6 players online, in both quest tab and ::players.

<p>Guessing playerassistant.java, Look for “Players Online” I am guessing they have it like  “+c.playersOnline+” * 2. Just get rid of the multiplication and it should work like a gem.

<p>It is more likely that a loop over the array occurred twice without the “playersOnline” being reset between them. Something happening to cause the counting to occur twice would be my guess. O_o<br>

<p>I was talking to him on skype it was the *2, usually your idea would be right but I had that source before and they added it in so it looked like they had lots of players lol.[/quote]<br>
Wow lol. Makes you feel real dumb when it shows “two online” XD</p>
