    <title>Your solution to the red x</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/your-solution-to-the-red-x/108715</link>
    <description>okay im sick of seeing posts such as &#39;omg the red x&#39; &#39;need help with the red x&#39; &#39;i just wanked over the red x&#39; and so on...

LISTEN

first ov all make sure u have the right freakin java!! just go to www.java.com and click the free download! thats all u need its the latest version! 
u dont need JDK or JRE or any of that pilava... 

secondly.. if you have the java! ----- the red x is still appearing right?? close down all internet explorer pages , or mozilla firefox pages, wait some few seconds and open a SINGLE new page. try again, this usually works and mopar will start loading.....

IF NOT.....
restart your pc and try again. this should always wrk 90% of the time as a backup plan!!

IF NOT (still).... 
PMGZORZ ur comp is crap. also it cud be a fault with mopar so just it a couple of hours and try again. if not the next day it will definately be working!!!

I know this came across as a bit harsh but trust me its useful info!

ALSO i wud like some replies please :D much appreciated as i just took 5 mins of time riting that for u hehe . Anywayz goodluck!! :D</description>
