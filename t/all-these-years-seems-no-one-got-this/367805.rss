    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/all-these-years-seems-no-one-got-this/367805</link>
    <description>i am using &quot;PkPlanet&quot; source and client from years,
today, i am bored from the client..
i want to change it!
but wait!
PkPlanet somehow logs you out if you are not using their client! LOL?
how do i make it only works for ANOTHER client?
not for pk planets client..
i don&#39;t want it removed ! but only it accepts another kind of client and refuses others.







-THANKS.</description>
