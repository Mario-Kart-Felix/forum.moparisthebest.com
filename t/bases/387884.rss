<p>Delta is very unstable and messy, almost everything is in one file… like you already said easy to understand for beginners</p>

<p>Pretty much this. It really just depends on the programmer’s style. Some people want to have everything in as few classes as possible(like winterLove servers), and some like to make things as Object Oriented as possible(like Hyperion).</p>
<p>Stability is also another thing. winterLove servers use standard, blocking IO which is acceptable for small network applications, but for scalability, Non-blocking IO is recommended. In fact in Java 7, the standard IO will be build upon NIO. You’ll still be able to have blocking networking by doing socketChannel.configureBlocking(true);</p>
<p>Performance is generally the deciding factor. For example, traditional winterLove servers create a new thread for every client. This is a problem because the server will become more laggy, and more unstable as more clients are connected. With Hyperion for example, there are only a few threads, and “events” handle everything else. That way, instead of updating every player, every tick of the server, it only updates players that require an update, and so on and so forth.[/quote]<br>
Oh, that even enlightened me. Good explanation.</p>
