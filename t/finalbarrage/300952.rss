    <description>[center][size=25pt]FinalBarrage[/size][/center]
[center][size=15pt]Thanks for checking out my thread, everything incuding pictures, and website approval are currently being possessed. Until then i&#39;ll write and tell you about FinalBarrage... Also this server is already in Version Two![/size][/center]
[center][size=15pt]Firstly, I started from scratch, but I have to admit. It was thrown together from several different server bases.[/size][/center]
[hr]
[center][size=20pt]Beta[/size][/center]
[center][size=10pt]The beta was a success after two tries.[/size][/center]
[center][size=10pt]There were few features, teleporting, walking, talking, interfaces, trading, and some NPCS.[/size][/center]
[hr]
[center][size=20pt]Version One[/size][/center]
[center][size=10pt]By now I had a basic working server. A few skills, Magic about 50%, specials, banking, Combat, Timers, and a few basic commands, Clipped walking and following Prayer, and emotes.[/size][/center]
[hr]
[center][size=20pt]Version Two[/size][/center]
[center][size=10pt]To begin, all I can say is wow. I never expected the growth that occurred. Were usually sitting at 105-150 online. Very impressive I think.[/size][/center]
[center][size=10pt]At this point I have most all the features of an amazing server such as good commands such as, ::afk, ::yell, and so many more! Full specials with glitches worked out. Not many customs, just important ones. EX: Dragon Claws and Dragon PlateBodys. I have tested my server up to 488 online stable and have blown off many attacks from AGF Bots and SSPoke crash clients. Also ive added skilling areas, Grand Exchange, and 20% Castle Wars (custom code).  [/size][/center]
[hr]
[center][size=20pt]Version Two and a Half[/size][/center]
[center][size=10pt]Now were doing even better and almost never go below 200 online and push 350 most days![/size]
[center][size=10pt]I recently upgraded server hardware and have noticed many improvements in game. No lagg being one of them and I&#39;ll post a picture just for reference.[/size]
[center][size=10pt]Finally the updates... Ive been updating things and blocking things such as &quot;BOMB&#39;S CHEAT CLIENT&quot;. I have also limited the player&#39;s name length to 12 characters to stop people from copying admins names or spamming. I&#39;m also going to release V3 soon! More customs better skilling and more.[/size]
