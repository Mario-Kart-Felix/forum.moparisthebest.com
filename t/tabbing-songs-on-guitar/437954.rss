			     [b]SHE WILL BE LOVED - Maroon 5[/b]

Feel free to email me with any questions.

Tuning: Standard with CAPO on 1st Fret

Chords (WITH CAPO):  
        [b]Bm[/b]: 335543
         [b]A[/b] : 113331
         [b]G [/b] : 355433
         [b]D [/b] : 000232


You could play it without a capo but it just sounds better with it. So if you were to play it without one, just play the chords normally, instead of one fret up.


Your&#39;e pretty much gonna play the intro the whole song.
During the Verse 1 and 2, pluck the 5th string with your thumb, the third string with your pointer finger (index) and second string with middle finger.
Sounds OK without middle finger, but for the real deal, use it.

Well here we go !
