    <title>Ingame Admin Or Mod Services</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ingame-admin-or-mod-services/148401</link>
    <description>Hello

First of all, I do not want to be branded as a beggar requesting mod/admin to feel cool or get free items or get more commands(If I wanted any of those I would just play on my own server).
I just have spair time and would like to help people who get alot of players regularly and need a good admin or mod to keep other players in order. When I am using a mod or admin account I do not muck around, I stand by anything I am told by the boss. I will help new players with commands or problems with items or clients, I will make sure players abide by rules and don&#39;t break them. So basically if anyone needs a mod or admin to enforce rules to all players on their server then I am up for it. Also I would like to have more people recommend/vouch me for jobs like this. :)

Thanks, 
Locksta
