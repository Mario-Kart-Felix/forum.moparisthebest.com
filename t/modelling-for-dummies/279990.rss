    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/modelling-for-dummies/279990</link>
    <description>Since i&#39;ve been on this site i&#39;ve seen countless threads with recolours, primitives, leeches and other bs and really that&#39;s just disgraceful.

Now using my very high intellect I have been able to realise that most of you are still in your developing ages of 1-3 so instead of trying to teach you like you would any normal person I though hey I might as well speak in a language you understand.  Pretty much i&#39;m making this guide to try and stop these constant leeches by users such as &quot;butterscaperules&quot; and many, many others.

This guide will show you how to trace model in metaseq, hopefully you can take that away and develop your new skills into something greater.  Now I can only do so much so don&#39;t expect me to chew and swallow for you as well because I simply can&#39;t do that and if you&#39;re actually so dumb you don&#39;t have the ability to learn then why are you even trying.

So pretty much if you&#39;re new to modelling and are asking &quot;What the hell is metaseq&quot; then please check out Silent CJ&#39;s guide:
[url=http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,363483.0.html]http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,363483.0.html[/url]

CJ&#39;s guide teaches you all the basics and explains what each button in metaseq is used for.  If you have no idea what i&#39;m talking about then follow his guide through in it&#39;s entirety then come back and follow mine.


So now i&#39;m assuming you have Metaseq, you understand how to draw lines, create faces and do all the basics.


[size=12pt][u]Step one: Find an Appropriate image[/u][/size]

I&#39;m making a taser for my Zombie Game so I thought i&#39;d use that throughout this guide.
I&#39;ve chosen to make a taser so i&#39;m going to go to google and in the image section I will search &#39;taser&#39;, if you have made it this far you aren&#39;t braindead.

So now I get this:
[URL=http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide1.jpg][IMG]http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide1.jpg[/img][/URL]

Lets look at the pictures to see which is most suitable.  Counting from left to right first we&#39;ll look at the 2nd image:
[URL=http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=guide2.jpg][IMG]http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_guide2.jpg[/img][/URL]


We don&#39;t want this, what we want is something with only an x and y axis, pretty much we are looking for an image that looks straight down on the object so there is no height.

The two that attract my eye are the eleventh image and the eightenth.  Well this is just personal opinion here, both are appropriate and in this case I am going to go for the eleventh image since it just looks a little better to model.

[size=12pt][u]Step 2: Put the Image into Metaseq[/u][/size]
Simply rightclick &quot;img&quot; then browse your diskdrive for your image.
I use top for pretty much everything but body and legs in which I use front since I model it around a RS Male Model.
[URL=http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide3.jpg][IMG]http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide3.jpg[/img][/URL]
[size=12pt]
[u]Step 3: Tracing, Lines[/u][/size]
Ok so this is where most of you guys have problems, I have no idea why but you do.
Here what you want to do is rename obj1 to lines, this object will contain your entire outline.
Now click &#39;create&#39; then on the little toolbox that comes up click &#39;both&#39; and &#39;line&#39;.
Simply trace your image now.
[URL=http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide4.jpg][IMG]http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide4.jpg[/img][/URL]


[size=12pt][u]Step 3.1: A few small Tracing tips[/u][/size]
Here are some tips for tracing your model correctly.

Always think about your model as if it&#39;s 3D, you need to remember that you are going to make it 3D later on so it is best to remember that your model will have curves, you are completely neglecting the z axis right now.

You can create new objects in the object toolbox, remember that faces within the same object will connect together if you use the same point so instead you simply create another object for each little component of your model so if you want you can connect certain points at the end and leave others, something which is hard to do if the points are already connected.

You can make mistakes.  If you make a mistake press ctrl+z to undo or ctrl+y to redo, or if something you did a while back is screwing up then use the select tool, it&#39;s there for a reason.

It doesn&#39;t need to be perfect, you can move points later on even when the faces are done.

[size=12pt][u]Step 3.2: Curving your model[/u][/size]
If you look at the picture below and go WTF! Just watch the transition of the model.

Now you want to place these lines at the highest or lowest point of the curve.
Well in the image below you will notice I havn&#39;t done it perfectly, that&#39;s because i&#39;m not putting too much detail into this since it is only a taser so I havn&#39;t got it all perfect and i&#39;m only using the model as a base outline i&#39;m not specifically trying to make the exact same model just a similar one.
[URL=http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide5.jpg][IMG]http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide5.jpg[/img][/URL]


Ok so now I add faces.  Yes I add triangles not faces but it really doesn&#39;t matter, i&#39;m used to using &#39;tri&#39; but really it makes no different really.
Oh and don&#39;t forget to make a new Object and a new Material using the toolboxes.
[URL=http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide6.jpg][IMG]http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide6.jpg[/img][/URL]


Well i&#39;m going to finish the whole handle of it now so I can show you exactly how you make these curve.
Ok when you&#39;re finished the handle lock your lines object and then go into the 3D mode.  I personally split it between either 3D and Front or 3D and Side but aye it doesn&#39;t matter that much.
Now you&#39;re going to want to select the move button on the left toolbar as well as lock any objects you are not editing.
Well here you want to select each point you want to move all at once, Shift+Click on each to do so
Now heres a problem, when i&#39;ve clicked them all when I move them up/down/left/right this happens:
[URL=http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide7.jpg][IMG]http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide7.jpg[/img][/URL]


The simple solution to this is to click on the object that you are doing this to then click &#39;Object&#39; then &#39;Join Closed Vertices&#39; if done correctly a box shold pop up, change the value inside to 0.10 and press ok.
If done right a box should come up either say &#39;x Vertices have been Joined&#39; or &#39;No Vertex Have been Joined&#39;.
Now go back to moving those points.

Now in the picture it curves down so i&#39;m going to move the points down:
[URL=http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide8.jpg][IMG]http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide8.jpg[/img][/URL]


Now you&#39;ve successfully curved a certain part of your model.
I am now going to go ahead and finish the rest of my model using the steps I have just taught you
Now i&#39;ve deleted all my lines now by going &#39;object&#39; then &#39;delete lines&#39; remember to have the object all the lines are in seleted.  Or of course you can just delete the object but if you have any lines in your other objects for some reason use that method said in the last sentence to get rid of them.
[URL=http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide9.jpg][IMG]http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide9.jpg[/img][/URL]


Now from here you can see that there are many little gaps between the sections of the model.  What you want to do is just using the &#39;create&#39; button again create faces as such:
You can do this is two ways, either make a new object and make all the faces in there or make faces for each different object and yer...
[URL=http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide10.jpg][IMG]http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide10.jpg[/img][/URL]


Ok so now we are pretty much done with the basic shape and outline of the model if you have come this far then congrats you can now model better than most people on this forum :D
[URL=http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide11.jpg][IMG]http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide11.jpg[/img][/URL]
[size=12pt][u]
Step 4: Mirroring and Finalizing model[/u][/size]

Ok well now what you want to do is merge all your objects together, make sure they&#39;re all in the right place though first because this is the last time you can modify it before it&#39;s pretty much stuck.  A good idea now would be for you to save a backup of your model like this so if there is a huge problem with your model you can fix it up and repeat the following steps again thus fixing your model.

Note: DO NOT MERGE IF YOUR PROPERTIES OF THE OBJECTS AREN&#39;T EXACTLY THE SAME.  IF YOU HAVE USED SAY SUBSERF ON 2 OF YOUR OBJECTS THEN GROUP ALL OBJECTS TOGETHER BUT THOSE 2 THEN GROUP THOSE 2 TOGETHER, THEN JUST FOLLOW THE NEXT STEPS BUT DOING THIS TO BOTH OBJECTS.

Once you have merged your objects you are going to want to move up so it is above the x and y axis.
[URL=http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide12.jpg][IMG]http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide12.jpg[/img][/URL]

Then you&#39;re going to want to click &#39;Sel Obj&#39; in the tool bar then click &#39;Selected&#39; then &#39;Mirror.
Now you have to choose between YZ, ZX and XY.  In this circumstance YZ will flip is horizontal, ZX will flip it inside out and XY will flip it vertical.
In this example the height is flat not curved in most areas so I can&#39;t show you how to do that.  It&#39;s just the same as curving the model before but you have to think 3D more, you MUST use the front and side views when curving in this area.
Pretty much now all you want to do is fill in the blanks like you did before, create some faces again!
[URL=http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide13.jpg][IMG]http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide13.jpg[/img][/URL]

I didn&#39;t have to change the z length of my taser at all but when you make your model it&#39;s a good idea to cut the mirrored image and make it another object.
This is so after you&#39;ve connected the 2 together with faces you can then then change the length of Z by using the &#39;Sel Obj&#39; and &#39;Move&#39; tools.

So by following this you can easily make a half decent model like this:
[URL=http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide14.jpg][IMG]http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide14.jpg[/img][/URL]





Please don&#39;t stop here, get better at modelling, if you followed this and did exactly what I did then add more to the taser to make it look more realistic and yer...
Happy modelling.</description>

              <p>Since i’ve been on this site i’ve seen countless threads with recolours, primitives, leeches and other bs and really that’s just disgraceful.</p>
<p>Now using my very high intellect I have been able to realise that most of you are still in your developing ages of 1-3 so instead of trying to teach you like you would any normal person I though hey I might as well speak in a language you understand.  Pretty much i’m making this guide to try and stop these constant leeches by users such as “butterscaperules” and many, many others.</p>
<p>This guide will show you how to trace model in metaseq, hopefully you can take that away and develop your new skills into something greater.  Now I can only do so much so don’t expect me to chew and swallow for you as well because I simply can’t do that and if you’re actually so dumb you don’t have the ability to learn then why are you even trying.</p>
<p>So pretty much if you’re new to modelling and are asking “What the hell is metaseq” then please check out Silent CJ’s guide:<br>
<a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,363483.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,363483.0.html</a></p>
<p>CJ’s guide teaches you all the basics and explains what each button in metaseq is used for.  If you have no idea what i’m talking about then follow his guide through in it’s entirety then come back and follow mine.</p>
<p>So now i’m assuming you have Metaseq, you understand how to draw lines, create faces and do all the basics.</p>
<p>[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-u">Step one: Find an Appropriate image</span>[/size]</p>
<p>I’m making a taser for my Zombie Game so I thought i’d use that throughout this guide.<br>
I’ve chosen to make a taser so i’m going to go to google and in the image section I will search ‘taser’, if you have made it this far you aren’t braindead.</p>
<p>So now I get this:<br>
<a href="http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide1.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide1.jpg" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>Lets look at the pictures to see which is most suitable.  Counting from left to right first we’ll look at the 2nd image:<br>
<a href="http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=guide2.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_guide2.jpg" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>We don’t want this, what we want is something with only an x and y axis, pretty much we are looking for an image that looks straight down on the object so there is no height.</p>
<p>The two that attract my eye are the eleventh image and the eightenth.  Well this is just personal opinion here, both are appropriate and in this case I am going to go for the eleventh image since it just looks a little better to model.</p>
<p>[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-u">Step 2: Put the Image into Metaseq</span>[/size]<br>
Simply rightclick “img” then browse your diskdrive for your image.<br>
I use top for pretty much everything but body and legs in which I use front since I model it around a RS Male Model.<br>
<a href="http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide3.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide3.jpg" alt width="" height=""></a><br>
[size=12pt]<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Step 3: Tracing, Lines</span>[/size]<br>
Ok so this is where most of you guys have problems, I have no idea why but you do.<br>
Here what you want to do is rename obj1 to lines, this object will contain your entire outline.<br>
Now click ‘create’ then on the little toolbox that comes up click ‘both’ and ‘line’.<br>
Simply trace your image now.<br>
<a href="http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide4.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide4.jpg" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-u">Step 3.1: A few small Tracing tips</span>[/size]<br>
Here are some tips for tracing your model correctly.</p>
<p>Always think about your model as if it’s 3D, you need to remember that you are going to make it 3D later on so it is best to remember that your model will have curves, you are completely neglecting the z axis right now.</p>
<p>You can create new objects in the object toolbox, remember that faces within the same object will connect together if you use the same point so instead you simply create another object for each little component of your model so if you want you can connect certain points at the end and leave others, something which is hard to do if the points are already connected.</p>
<p>You can make mistakes.  If you make a mistake press ctrl+z to undo or ctrl+y to redo, or if something you did a while back is screwing up then use the select tool, it’s there for a reason.</p>
<p>It doesn’t need to be perfect, you can move points later on even when the faces are done.</p>
<p>[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-u">Step 3.2: Curving your model</span>[/size]<br>
If you look at the picture below and go WTF! Just watch the transition of the model.</p>
<p>Now you want to place these lines at the highest or lowest point of the curve.<br>
Well in the image below you will notice I havn’t done it perfectly, that’s because i’m not putting too much detail into this since it is only a taser so I havn’t got it all perfect and i’m only using the model as a base outline i’m not specifically trying to make the exact same model just a similar one.<br>
<a href="http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide5.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide5.jpg" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>Ok so now I add faces.  Yes I add triangles not faces but it really doesn’t matter, i’m used to using ‘tri’ but really it makes no different really.<br>
Oh and don’t forget to make a new Object and a new Material using the toolboxes.<br>
<a href="http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide6.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide6.jpg" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>Well i’m going to finish the whole handle of it now so I can show you exactly how you make these curve.<br>
Ok when you’re finished the handle lock your lines object and then go into the 3D mode.  I personally split it between either 3D and Front or 3D and Side but aye it doesn’t matter that much.<br>
Now you’re going to want to select the move button on the left toolbar as well as lock any objects you are not editing.<br>
Well here you want to select each point you want to move all at once, Shift+Click on each to do so<br>
Now heres a problem, when i’ve clicked them all when I move them up/down/left/right this happens:<br>
<a href="http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide7.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide7.jpg" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>The simple solution to this is to click on the object that you are doing this to then click ‘Object’ then ‘Join Closed Vertices’ if done correctly a box shold pop up, change the value inside to 0.10 and press ok.<br>
If done right a box should come up either say ‘x Vertices have been Joined’ or ‘No Vertex Have been Joined’.<br>
Now go back to moving those points.</p>
<p>Now in the picture it curves down so i’m going to move the points down:<br>
<a href="http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide8.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide8.jpg" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>Now you’ve successfully curved a certain part of your model.<br>
I am now going to go ahead and finish the rest of my model using the steps I have just taught you<br>
Now i’ve deleted all my lines now by going ‘object’ then ‘delete lines’ remember to have the object all the lines are in seleted.  Or of course you can just delete the object but if you have any lines in your other objects for some reason use that method said in the last sentence to get rid of them.<br>
<a href="http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide9.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide9.jpg" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>Now from here you can see that there are many little gaps between the sections of the model.  What you want to do is just using the ‘create’ button again create faces as such:<br>
You can do this is two ways, either make a new object and make all the faces in there or make faces for each different object and yer…<br>
<a href="http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide10.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide10.jpg" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>Ok so now we are pretty much done with the basic shape and outline of the model if you have come this far then congrats you can now model better than most people on this forum <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
<a href="http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide11.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide11.jpg" alt width="" height=""></a><br>
[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><br>
Step 4: Mirroring and Finalizing model</span>[/size]</p>
<p>Ok well now what you want to do is merge all your objects together, make sure they’re all in the right place though first because this is the last time you can modify it before it’s pretty much stuck.  A good idea now would be for you to save a backup of your model like this so if there is a huge problem with your model you can fix it up and repeat the following steps again thus fixing your model.</p>
<p>Note: DO NOT MERGE IF YOUR PROPERTIES OF THE OBJECTS AREN’T EXACTLY THE SAME.  IF YOU HAVE USED SAY SUBSERF ON 2 OF YOUR OBJECTS THEN GROUP ALL OBJECTS TOGETHER BUT THOSE 2 THEN GROUP THOSE 2 TOGETHER, THEN JUST FOLLOW THE NEXT STEPS BUT DOING THIS TO BOTH OBJECTS.</p>
<p>Once you have merged your objects you are going to want to move up so it is above the x and y axis.<br>
<a href="http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide12.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide12.jpg" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>Then you’re going to want to click ‘Sel Obj’ in the tool bar then click ‘Selected’ then 'Mirror.<br>
Now you have to choose between YZ, ZX and XY.  In this circumstance YZ will flip is horizontal, ZX will flip it inside out and XY will flip it vertical.<br>
In this example the height is flat not curved in most areas so I can’t show you how to do that.  It’s just the same as curving the model before but you have to think 3D more, you MUST use the front and side views when curving in this area.<br>
Pretty much now all you want to do is fill in the blanks like you did before, create some faces again!<br>
<a href="http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide13.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide13.jpg" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>I didn’t have to change the z length of my taser at all but when you make your model it’s a good idea to cut the mirrored image and make it another object.<br>
This is so after you’ve connected the 2 together with faces you can then then change the length of Z by using the ‘Sel Obj’ and ‘Move’ tools.</p>
<p>So by following this you can easily make a half decent model like this:<br>
<a href="http://s98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/?action=view&amp;current=Guide14.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l253/wayzey/th_Guide14.jpg" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>Please don’t stop here, get better at modelling, if you followed this and did exactly what I did then add more to the taser to make it look more realistic and yer…<br>
Happy modelling.</p>
