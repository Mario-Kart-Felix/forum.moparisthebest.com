    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/games-at-school/435657</link>
    <description>I haz a online 6th period APEX -History and i finished all of my second semester in the winter break and now i be playing games like CS 1.6 (counterstrike) and bf1942 (battlefield  1942) during 6th period Even our teacher plays (if not going home)

but im wondering why can you install cs1.6 but not bf1942 (i install on my computer and transfer all the files to usb and play off of it) 
Anyone know?</description>

assuming you’re going for a science-based degree, uni is a lot of work, but a lot of freedom.<br>

Well known fact, uni is hard work but really relaxed. if you don’t put the effort in and fail there not going to make extra effort just for you. Personally i’d rather college, i like getting extra help</p>

Most likely because bf1942 installs values to the registry which are not moved when you copy the folder from program files.</p>
<p>Unless somebody out there has created a portable version of it (there are plenty of portable recent games that I have), you probably won’t be able to make it work.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>that is what i think it is it dosen’t let you install things to registry but if you make your own custom portable version without registry i think it might work[/quote]<br>
That would be correct.</p>
