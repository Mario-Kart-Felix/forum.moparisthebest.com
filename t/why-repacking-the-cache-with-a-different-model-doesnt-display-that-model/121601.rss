    <title>Why repacking the cache with a different model doesn&#39;t display that model</title>

    <description>(Sorry, i&#39;m new to moparscape and didn&#39;t know where to post this)
It doesn&#39;t work because all models have different properties, eg. Vertex..etc...
And this is why it wont work,
You must parse the models properties, and since your model is most likely going to differ from jagex&#39;s models
IT will not load, because all models have a different vertex.
And to find the vertex you must search through the model with a text editor(Prefferably .Obj).
Thats why your inexperienced if you think you can simply change the model in the cache and expect it to load, because the Runescape client is only Made to Display that Certain model!
From experience, Figured out how to pack cache today. then wondered why that particular model didn&#39;t load.
It is possible, just not cache wise!

If you don&#39;t believe this, search google. or try to write your own script that loads a model.
It won&#39;t display because your not parsing anything to display!</description>

Seeing as i can’t export models in the .mdl format, i have to rewrite certain stuff because i only own maya wavefront.</p>
