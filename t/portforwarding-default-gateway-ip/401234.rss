    <title>PortForwarding default Gateway IP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/portforwarding-default-gateway-ip/401234</link>
    <description>i am setting up a server, it is coded and complete. the only problem is when i type in my default gateway to the address bar, it comes up as a 404 page not found. i tried finding help, and nothing worked. i hope the expertise of the moparscape community could have a possible solution.

info: 
my Cisco E1000 is messed, i can only access the main on my desktop. on both of my laptops theres a problem connecting to my main and forces me to use the guest. i am using the guest for the server. if need be, can i portforward on my other computer(desktop) and still run the server on my laptop if i am technically connected to the same router?</description>
