    <description>As above, the teleports for my bosses just stopped working randomly and im not sure whats wrong :f as i dont think ive changed the code in anyway and all the other teles work. When i click it, it opens the list of bosses but does nothing when i click them.

heres part of the code although it hasnt changed since it was working.. =[

 else if (c.teleAction == 3) {
					//godwars
					c.getPA().spellTeleport(2916, 3612, 0);
					//c.getPA().walkableInterface(16210);


and


case 50253:
			case 117131:
			case 4146:
			c.getDH().sendOption4(&quot;Godwars&quot;, &quot;King Black Dragon (Wild)&quot;, &quot;Dagannoth Kings&quot;, &quot;Chaos Elemental (Wild)&quot;);
			c.teleAction = 3;
			break;
