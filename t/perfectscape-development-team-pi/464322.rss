This project will not cram new content, but instead make existing content cleaner and less unorganized while adding features to accommodate the Perfectscape theme. 
The goal for this project is to take an average PI server with average content. Add above average client work. Such as custom shop interfaces, Custom tab effects, etc etc. Then focus on making the existing content cleaner.

[b]Why should I apply ?[/b]

[ul][li]Much work done will be to the cache and client. Filling the large gap for programmers with not much skill in these areas. [/li]
[li] Community&#39;s build fast. We plan on hosting once we feel we are ready as a team. This is your chance to be a part of a successful community[/li]
[li]Your hard work will never be sold or released! You will always be able to login and say hello, because the server will be hosted not released.[/li]
[li]We won&#39;t even accept donations until we grow as a community. And even then they will be limited and only used to upgrade the server-vps to keep up with the growing community.[/li]
[li][b]There is no Owner, Server programmers Co-Owners... etc.. Just programmers who enjoying a relaxing environment doing something we enjoy. [/b][/li][/ul]



Please use this format to apply. You must answer honestly and to the best of your knowledge.
[u]Applying without this format or answering dishonestly will destroy any chances of joining this team.[/u]

<p>Yeah, I’ve built a graveyard of PI’s taking some of the ideas I can use. This came from “webberscape” hard to tell who came up with it originally, its just a simple image that takes 10mins to make and I’ve already changed the color so I won’t give any credits.</p>
<p>[quote=“Kidpaparoach, post:3, topic:464322”]Tab colour clashes but looks cool I guess^.</p>
<p>Having no owner makes a problem when it comes to what ideas will be implemented. You need a chain of command.[/quote]<br>
tweaked it a bit  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>I want a democracy, any ideas get voted on by the programmers. My goal is to keep things open and give our programmers some say. (at times I may have to step in and push us in the right direction.)</p>
<p>If this doesn’t work out its easy to make a chain of command.</p>

<p>This project will not cram new content, but instead make existing content cleaner and less unorganized while adding features to accommodate the Perfectscape theme.<br>
The goal for this project is to take an average PI server with average content. Add above average client work. Such as custom shop interfaces, Custom tab effects, etc etc. Then focus on making the existing content cleaner.<br>

<p>[ul][li]Much work done will be to the cache and client. Filling the large gap for programmers with not much skill in these areas. [/li]<br>
[li] Community’s build fast. We plan on hosting once we feel we are ready as a team. This is your chance to be a part of a successful community[/li]<br>
[li]Your hard work will never be sold or released! You will always be able to login and say hello, because the server will be hosted not released.[/li]<br>
[li]We won’t even accept donations until we grow as a community. And even then they will be limited and only used to upgrade the server-vps to keep up with the growing community.[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-b">There is no Owner, Server programmers Co-Owners… etc… Just programmers who enjoying a relaxing environment doing something we enjoy. </span>[/li][/ul]</p>
