    <title>Need Help From 317 PI Server Owners! VERY VERY SIMPLE FOR YOU!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-from-317-pi-server-owners-very-very-simple-for-you/409553</link>
    <description>I know I may sound noob and retarded... But I need help from somebody who owns a 317 PI to set mine up. I have a source (untouched by me) and have no clue on setting it up, due to the fact that I&#39;m new to Project Insanity. I have always used Delta but from what I see PI is the better way to go. Could somebody please Teamviewer with me to help me set it up, so I&#39;ll know how to in the future. I&#39;m not used to the bin and src files and stuff. Could somebody please help and explain? I&#39;ll easily REP++ for any help at all. :)
Thanks!!</description>
