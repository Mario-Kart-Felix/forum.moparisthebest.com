    <title>Problem from doing &quot;how to make a server guide&quot;</title>

    <description>(I&#39;m not trying to make the server anymore)

When i changed the CLASS and CLASSPATH like the guide said I haven&#39;t been able to do play runescape or use private servers. An example runescape won&#39;t load, when I click run on downloaded clients says press any key to continue then i do and it closes. It screwed up something anyway and I don&#39;t know a lot about java or computers :(. And I was wondering if anybody knew what was wrong.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 16, 2008, 03:05:30 am[/size][hr]any1 know im still here[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 16, 2008, 03:11:17 am[/size][hr]the rules said no asking computer problems, use google. what am i supposed to search moparscape tutorial messed up my java?</description>
