    <title>Stuck up pures</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stuck-up-pures/192645</link>
    <description>I know I just made a topic yesterday about runescape. But about 5 minutes ago I was on my pure at duel arena walking around with my red chaps on and bone c&#39;bow. (dorgeshun , or w/e its called...) And I was up to this level 85 pure. I send him a duel challenge for fun he asks me if I want to get owned really badly. I told him chill it was a game. Then he puts his str cape on. I thought , If you think that intimidates then i don&#39;t know what the fuck you are smoking. I thought that made him a big nerd. Then he called me a nub and was shouting about how I didn&#39;t know how to play the game. I asked him to go outside , because it&#39;s fun. He said I needed to go outside.... WHAT??? I told him he needed a life apart from runescape.. he told me that I was a nerd and ran away...

The point of this topic is why do some pures think their the awesome when their really just no lifers that need to exercise and go outside and be active , just like I am going to do after this topic is finished.
Why? Their not that great really. Why are mostly pures stuck up? 5/100 pures are nice I would say. Like 2 days ago my clan was going to war this other clan and this level 78 with mage 99 cape and fire cape started flashing it off saying were all noobs . he was actually following us switching between capes calling us noobs!

I would never do this.

Off topic story.
This level 80 was asking this level 84 where do I get defenders. I told him I would take him and he said no I was a nub.
...
I would have of gladly took him their and he would say ty i would say yw...
but no!
I would say about 25/100 regular players that are not pure are nice .
That is just to me.



WHY ARE THESE DANG PURES SO MEAN AND THINK THEY ARE BETTER1!!!!!!!!</description>

They train there because they’re practically famous spots, and anyone who has good knowledge of RuneScape2 would direct them to those areas if they asked for a good place to train.</p>
<p>Few of them view RuneScape2 as a technical game.  Even if they do, main accounts would do so even more due to the fact that they’re training combat alongside every other skill.[/quote]</p>
<p>Theres more to making a good pure than knowing where to train. When I made my level 57 back in the day, I spent some time messing with a combat calculator, considering accuracy and loot, watching people’s max hits and hp to work out how to make a good pure, with what stats at what combat level. I ended up being undefeated in 1 vs 1 except 1 fight and that was because of really bad luck with hits.</p>
