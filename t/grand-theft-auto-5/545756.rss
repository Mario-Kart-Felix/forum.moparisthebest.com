    <title>Grand Theft Auto 5?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/grand-theft-auto-5/545756</link>
    <description>It&#39;s probably been posted. And no, I&#39;m not going to whine about heists or whatever is wrong with it.
I just want to know people&#39;s opinions on it, or how their experience playing it was.

I&#39;ll start with mine.

Storyline:
I&#39;m not ruining or spoiling anything, but all I&#39;m going to say is, it&#39;s engaging. VERY engaging. You can&#39;t be lazy on it (unless you cheat, of course) but you have to actually get engaged and the storyline between the characters/dialogue is really interesting. I played the story line and completed it around 4 times, (almost done 5th) just to test out how the game ends up with every choice you make. I was not disappointed, I&#39;d say this was very well done.

Gameplay:
It&#39;s an amazing game in my opinion. Not just because of the features, but because of the detail. I&#39;m thinking about all those millions of civilians in the area who have dynamic features with every character with different voices. 
Also, the main characters react to each and every scenario that they&#39;re put in, and the scenarios are all based on the player&#39;s decision, like, the voices and actions and cutscenes were dynamic with every choice made, which I think is insanely awesome. They didn&#39;t just half-ass things, they actually put intense work in it. Though, they did leave out some features that players loved (pfft, who gives a shit) (just kidding, I miss some features too), but replaced them with more, different and useful ones.

Now, the online on the other hand, is not too bad. It&#39;s a 7/10 experience at the moment because there&#39;s not much to do after you&#39;ve finished all missions. You just, roam around doing nothing when you&#39;ve reached level 100+ (it&#39;s different from single player)
I think they should add a mission creator, which lets players create their own missions. Would be cool.

What do y&#39;all think? Best moments, favorite mission, general experience, opinion?

<p>I got GTA V and Diablo III so far, takes forever to download and then transfer to the ps3… but i’m glad I did it! I have the game discs, but playing without them is better…  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>You should trade your super slim for a slim. They have services for like $60 including shipping + the service to downgrade + flash to CFW if you aren’t capable. My friend has the set up to do it so he let me borrow the stuff since he’s going out of town. Or look into ODE</p>

<p>Jets. You can also use the guns of it which is insanely strong, and it’s great if you’re in closer combat or dogfighting.</p>

[/quote]<br>
Go into the military base during missions. When you die in there, you respawn in there. I believe you need to play a mission that has 2 teams, and one person is on the other team (at least). Once you’re in the base. kill each other/get killed and you’ll get xp every now and then. You dont have to kil each other. I was getting xp by blowing up tanks and flying around in the base. The reason you do it in the mission is for the close respawn and you don’t lose money for dying.</p>
<p>Plus, there are weapons I’m sure you can get for killing military personnel. My brother and I also managed to cargobob a tank out of the base (not in a mission).[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah, the fun part about in public sessions is you can get your friend to come with you and kill random people. Not fun for them, fun for us. Or you can kill cops. Either way it’s fun</p>

<p>YES. I dunno about ammo, but you can hijack a military jet that has lock-on rockets and flies incredibly fast. It can be hard to get in without dying sometimes (because the guys in the base shoot you as soon as you get in) but once you do successfully hijack it it is so much fun.</p>

<p>Thank you. I have to agree with you 100%. The graphics should not be the most important part of the game. A lot of us that are now of age to play/buy the game started out generally where you did. With shitty graphics on games. If the game was more smooth in general, it would be better. The lag you get in multiplayer can be unreal sometimes. And they really need to fix it where if you’re lagging that the map stops loading correctly, that shit should be done locally.<br>
[/quote]<br>
In reality, even those who started off with a PS2 or an Xbox still know the feeling of poor graphics games. I almost wish the game took a leaf out of Saints Row’s book book and amped up the craziness, right now I feel like the worst you can do is run a red light.[/quote]</p>
<p>I still remember ps1 and gameboy days. Used to play Syphon filter and pokemon, crash bandicoot, spyro.<br>
Then ps2 was grand theft auto most the time.<br>
Ps3 was a whole new experience <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>it’s actually amazing how where we started with a hell of a lot of pixels showing (nostalgia) to where we are now with near-realistic graphics, I mean, take a look at division! It’s insane.</p>
<p>But anyways, they should really fix up the multiplayer, as said above earlier</p>

<p>Imo, random events are what makes open worlds so amazing. Being able to walk down a street and have a money truck appear and then drive down another street and watch a gang fight happen would make this game really amazing, but in reality they’ve patched basically every good random event that doesn’t take days to see again. the multiplayer experience is basically playing free for all matches in an open world game.

<p>There, someone gets me!</p>
<p>Graphics on the other hand, PS4 version has a <span class="bbcode-b">LOT</span> better graphics and texture, lighting, detail… etc. than the ps3 version so if people think GTA5 has good graphics, wait till they see next gen. Absolutely amazing. Check it out!</p>

<p>Yeah I didn’t get that experience at all lol. I bought a buzzard, which is fun as hell to use. Except you can blow up drugs when you hit a guy, which makes the rockets (the only good gun on the buzzard) completely useless. And any mission that involves killing people in an elimination style, always ends up with 3 stars the moment the missile goes off. If it had been GTA IV cops then it wouldn’t be too bad, but in GTA V they are like omniscient and can take you down in like 5 seconds.</p>

<p>I want them to add more group activities, like you team up and destroy shit. Would be fun. Or, to have random events in multiplayer. Like, you help people (same as single player), and they work for you. For example; if you save a person and they are willing to help you and you decide to play an online mission alone, you can choose if they join with you as AI.</p>

<p>No way GTA 5 is much better than any other GTA. You really must not be a GTA type of guy because the game really is great. I personally don’t like the online play though.</p>
