    <title>Primitive Flail :o (V3 Finished)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/primitive-flail-o-v3-finished/292205</link>
    <description>Ok, I have decided to make an actual (hopefully at least decent) primitive model. It won&#39;t be anything big, but it will be something that [i]should[/i] be able to work in a 317 server. I probably won&#39;t finish it tonight, but tomorrow it should be done. I&#39;ll post some progress pictures too.

7/31/09, 10:42 P.M. -- Tired.

              <p>He might have meant move away from stacking primitives on top of each other, in which case he would be right. When you start with a primitive and extrude, bevel, cut, crease, ect you are doing what is called object modeling which is what you should do after awhile. I am only agreeing with him if thats what he meant.</p>

<p>Buddy[/quote]<br>
what the F**K are you talking about? Primitive modelling is the base of ALL 3D animation. Trace method came after. Most professional modellers do not trace/draw as the mesh ends up messy and not clean. it make ALOT more sense to model through primitive method for high poly, high detail, or atleast ive found it to be. you must learn your shit, as JJones said. Dont even respond to other peoples models. i dont want to have them take your incorrect advice and do things wrong. Rip4D do not listen to this. keep primitive modelling and ill teach you how to use blender efficiently.</p>

Buddy, you have no idea what you are talking about. The most respected modellers are primitive modellers. Dont give advice untill you are certain it is effective, and dont give modelling advice untill you know how to at least recolor…</p>

Hmm, after the models that Dylan has made with 99.9% primitives, I encourage primitives if you can get the hang of it. It is just hard to start with and hard to get used to.</p>
