    <description>[s]Ok, im trying to make my BATCH file compile all my classes and put them in a specified folder..

Like, instead of it compiling all the classes and putting the class file&#39;s everywhere i want them in a folder called &quot;bin&quot;, of course.... If anyone can help me with that, Please do. :D[/s]

Solved my own problem, Thanks anyway.[/size]


Never mind, I played around with the -help feature in the JDK menu and i figured it out.


I came up with this conclusion.

[code]
@echo off
title  Compile
javac -cp . -d Source/Bin/ ./Source/*.java
pause
