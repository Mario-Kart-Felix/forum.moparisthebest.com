    <description>Please forgive me if this can be found somewhere.

(this is for more peaple, more peaple have this problem on the server!)
Hello, My friend is running a private server and im a mod on there. (yay)
There is 1 problem, sometimes my client just freezes down and i cant login anymore.
The server owner says that im logged in, but i just see a blackscreen and it dousnt load anything.

(this is for more peaple, more peaple have this problem on the server!)

As you can see, it just freezes there, if i put a other window in front of it, and minimize it again the moparscape client will go white where the screen was and wont refresh back or anything.
(Cant explain well, ill include a picture but its not that important. It just shows the client really froze)
(this is for more peaple, more peaple have this problem on the server!)

I think its a server bug, cus i have the same problem on the webclient.
Thanks in advance.

(i Posted this both in Server help/client help because im not sure what it is)</description>
