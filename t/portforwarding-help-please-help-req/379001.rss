<p>If your mummy won’t give you the router USER/PASS then you’re not going to be able to login, if so, try checking here; <a href="http://www.portforward.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.portforward.com</a> .[/quote]</p>
<p>I would have posted this exact thing but he beat me to it &gt;.&lt;  Seriously dude, if you cant log in don’t bother. How about this, heres an idea, use your BRAIN, theres gotta be one in there since you were able to register… ASK YOUR MOTHER IF SHE CAN TYPE PASS FOR YOU AND WATCH YOU DO IT SO THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO PORTFORWARD AND SHE CAN BE AT EASE KNOWING THATS ALL YOU ARE DOING.</p>
<p>Quit being suck a D!CK people here have tried to help you, you are the one thats lazy because you can’t figure such an easy thing out as asking your mom…<br>

Ok, I was trying to help, no need to flame, let’s face it, if my mind was small I wouldn’t be helping you.<br>
If I was all of the above, your basically saying i’m retarded and we all know who’s the retard here. So if you acctually checked that amazingly useful site maybe you’ll be able to fix your “little” problem. And it’s not my fault my mummy is better then me on computers.</p>
