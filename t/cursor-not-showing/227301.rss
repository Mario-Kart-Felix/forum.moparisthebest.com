    <title>Cursor not showing?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cursor-not-showing/227301</link>
    <description>Hi, ive got a slight problem on my client and i really need to fix it as many players think the passwords wont work and are leaving them blank.

So how can i get the cursor to show ? It shows on the username field but not password.

And

How can i make it so people have to have a password ?

Ive done some searching but cant find anything :(

Thanks Brendan</description>
