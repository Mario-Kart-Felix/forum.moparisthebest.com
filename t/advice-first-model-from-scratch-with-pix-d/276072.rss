mmk well just cause i h8 bein flamed bout sht, i started trying with meta, and made these from scratch, prob not positioned right but oh well, ikno i messed up on the making it 3d ALOT, i had trouble making the 2d model basically just widen to 3d so i could work from there, but it didnt work out too well, it left a bunch of flaws and these small rectangles etc. 

I posted this for the soul purpose of advice and help, idc for u nerd flamers cause if thats what ur life career is, ur doing a good job, i hope u feel proud, now  for all of u who care, advice pl0x :P

[epic edits]
k well i just forgot, i made ALOT of faces lmfao, more than i should have, i kno ;[ but i r a tart atm with all this

- Colours r dull atm, no detail rlly, i just need advice for the shape texture etc, not colours.

[credits] all teh ppl who flamed me for recolours, woulnt have made me think of starting with meta
uhm the ppl&#39;s tuts i used for the tools, i did every thing bymyself ACCEPT THE LEARNING OF THE TOOLS o.o, eyes nd finger action ;]


if it fails beyond anything, just say &quot; it failz&quot; k? it avoids the flaming</description>
