    <description>We regret to inform you that this account has been banned because of Real World Trading

Please refer to article number 12 of the Rules of Conduct:

RuneScape items must only be exchanged for other items/services within the game. Exchanging RuneScape items for items or other benefits in other online games, real-life money or other real-life benefits is not allowed.

Additionally this is a direct breach of the Terms &amp; Conditions of Membership:

RuneScape items may only be exchanged for other items/services within the game. You must not exchange RuneScape items, gold or in-game services for real-life money, real-life benefits, or benefits in other online games. You acknowledge that doing so would harm RuneScape, by allowing players to &#39;buy&#39; their way to success, which spoils the experience for others and thus causes damage to us. You must not act as an intermediary to help others make infringing trades.

You hereby acknowledge that Jagex owns all intellectual property rights in the materials on this web site, including all materials associated with RuneScape. You may not use these materials except as expressly provided in these terms and conditions.

We have evidence to prove that you have being buying RuneScape items via means other than legitimate in-game trades and for the financial benefit of parties other than Jagex. We also know you were in control of this account at the time of these offences. We do not discuss our detection process with anyone; to do such would give users information to help them avoid detection.

We are 100% confident in our detection systems, and in the highly trained staff who monitor and take action based on the results presented by these systems, and as such are 100% confident that you have been playing the game in a manner which directly violates our Rules of Conduct, Terms &amp; Conditions of Membership, and Intellectual Property rights. All of these rules are available via our www.runescape.com website and by creating an account for RuneScape you have agreed to accept and follow these rules.

Due to the nature of the offence and the history of your account you have been placed on a Permanent Ban. The decision on this account is final and will not be changed. 

Any further Appeals will not be reviewed.

Sincerely,
RuneScape Customer Support
