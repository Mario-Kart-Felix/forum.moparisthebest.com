    <title>Where did i screw up with port forwarding?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-did-i-screw-up-with-port-forwarding/363682</link>
    <description>I checked my port and it said its open.
I downloaded some port forwarding software to open it.
but then when i open my source run.bat it says port already in use?
so i exited out of the port forward software and re opened my run.bat and it worked but then when i started my port forward software it said port already in use.</description>

              <p>Itâ€™s in the right section. And you downloaded uTorrent im sure. You have to go on uTorrent and remove the port you entered under preferences. If you still have trouble add me on msn: <a href="mailto:Randon_m@hotmail.com">Randon_m@hotmail.com</a></p>
