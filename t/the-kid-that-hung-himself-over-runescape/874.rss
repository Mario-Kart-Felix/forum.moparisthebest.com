<p>Why? For bumping a three year old topic, or for wishing a dead guy good luck? I actually read some of the posts on this topic, and I think it’s hilarious how some people in the topic we pissed because people thought it was funny. Nowadays we all would laugh about it and make jokes.</p>

              <p>I agree with scar, You guys arent seeing the big picture, most people hang themselves over problems with their parents or at school, this guy had both, I too have thought to myself, If there wasnt rs(which i enjoy playing to talk to FRIENDS), my friends, and my loved ones and if i were having problems then i would seriously consider suicide. This guy who had only his friend on rs, which then scammed him 11m, which to some can take quite a while to get(ive played 2 years onyl got 8m -.-), So he got fed up and killed himself. That isnt a laughing matter, Someone killed themself. Even if it was over something not too big, It was also about family and school. You should Have atleast some consideration for him.</p>

<p>I am smarter than you because I have over 80 more rep than you, I have a java cup, I’m a mod on lots of forums, I do well at school, and also because I have more friends than you, and the fact that I’m better than you at everything even the only thing which you’re good at which is spamming/flaming, I therefore am more intelligent, responsible and mature on all levels of this argument.[/quote]</p>
<p>ok maybe you’re too dumb to understand this  but :<br>
KNOWING JAVA DOES NOT MEAN YOU’RE SMART<br>
trust me if i do my best il learn java very quickly</p>
<p>more friends then me?? and how would you know that?<br>
yea so maybe everyone adds you on msn and ask question about : how do i get in a private server?<br>
so then you think : “wow i got allots of friends”</p>
<p>trust me …the only thing you are better in is coding in java and within a few months(depends on how much i want to learn java ) il learn it too.</p>
<p>so you think having more rep makes you smarter??LMAO!!!</p>
<p>edit: yea i almost forgot something about you.<br>
you once put a pic of a girl you dont even know on your website and saying it was you<br>
how pathetic is that??that means your ugly as hell cause if you werent you would put a pic of your own</p>
