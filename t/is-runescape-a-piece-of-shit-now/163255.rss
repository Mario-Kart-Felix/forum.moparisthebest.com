    <description>I think jagex has turned runescape into a piece of shit, the gameframes lag horribly. I liked it better with 371 gameframe or w/e the name was. Debate?</description>

<p>I think I also have an unfinished sentence in there.</p>
<p>[quote=“xxlegitxx, post:30, topic:163255”]When I play RS, it’s for the interaction between players.  Interaction with people somewhere across the globe is the main reason I play Runescape.  Why not play a flash game instead?  Because I could talk to, annoy, and pk real people.  Now, we can’t even have drop parties.  We can’t even give noobs items to start out with.  We can’t even have some high stakes playing.</p>
<p>Jagex, in one fell swoop, you killed the three most lucrative and attractive aspects of RS:  pking, staking, and merchanting.  You crippled the economy from capitalism (buyers set the price) to communism (market price is defined).  Staking tournaments are now no better than the lottery.  PKing got watered down into a mini-game even Barbie could play.  What’s next, a merry-go-round mini-game?  Helping people with love instead of killing people with weapons?  Pink and blue ponies everywhere?</p>
<p>Jagex, you realize that the average player doesn’t care about macroers at all.  The negative effects of macroers were limited to a lack of yew trees.  Is there a difference now, Jagex?  Did all the macroers disappear?  Or were those all the legit players who are sickened, utterly sickened by the ridiculous limitations placed to hinder not only the cheaters, but the average player as well.  Do you realize that raw materials are not the only reason people macro?  How will you deal with account trading and theft?  IP addresses change normally, and you would need a team of professional linguists to detect differences in typing syntax.</p>
<p>You can’t kill the black market.  Even the most powerful governments in the world cannot stop illegal activity.  Do you think you can do any better?  Do you honestly think that macroing or black market trading will simply give up?  As long as there is a demand for an item, there will always be a black market for it.  The only way for you to totally eliminate a black market is for RS to suck so much that no one wants to play, not that you’re far from it.</p>
<p>And don’t even get me started on the party room.  Who actually puts over 1m in a party room just for leechers who come in, grab the items, and leave?  What if we’re having a clan event?  What if we just want to give items to a group of 5 people, not the 169369 people playing right now?</p>
<p>I want drop parties.  I want to give free items to noobs.  I want to be able to pk, stake, and merchant.</p>
<p>I will organize as many mass log-outs, boycotts, and riots as it takes to get you to realize you did nothing but completely and utterly ruin the game.</p>
<p>Jagex, what can make you put RS back the way it was a year ago?[/quote]</p>

the gauge makes sense, but forcing people to pay a rough equality? No, that is just wrong in most perspectives. Its like saying you cant go lend people something for a day or just a friendly deal that they would pay back. when it comes to clan things, they may have things going where every member does their share and the goods get passed around and distributed evenly.

We can’t even have some high stakes playing.</p>
<p>Jagex, in one fell swoop, you killed the three most lucrative and attractive aspects of RS:  pking, staking, and merchanting.  You crippled the economy from capitalism (buyers set the price) to communism (market price is defined).  Staking tournaments are now no better than the lottery.  PKing got watered down into a mini-game even Barbie could play.  What’s next, a merry-go-round mini-game?  Helping people with love instead of killing people with weapons?  Pink and blue ponies everywhere?</p>
<p>Jagex, you realize that the average player doesn’t care about macroers at all.  The negative effects of macroers were limited to a lack of yew trees.  Is there a difference now, Jagex?  Did all the macroers disappear?  Or were those all the legit players who are sickened, utterly sickened by the ridiculous Do you realize that raw materials are not the only reason people macro?  How will you deal with account trading and theft?  IP addresses change normally, and you would need a team of professional linguists to detect differences in typing syntax.</p>
<p>You can’t kill the black market.  Even the most powerful governments in the world cannot stop illegal activity.  Do you think you can do any better?  Do you honestly think that macroing or black market trading will simply give up?  As long as there is a demand for an item, there will always be a black market for it.  The only way for you to totally eliminate a black market is for RS to suck so much that no one wants to play, not that you’re far from it.</p>
<p>And don’t even get me started on the party room.  Who actually puts over 1m in a party room just for leechers who come in, grab the items, and leave?  What if we’re having a clan event?  What if we just want to give items to a group of 5 people, not the 169369 people playing right now?</p>
<p>I want drop parties.  I want to give free items to noobs.  I want to be able to pk, stake, and merchant.</p>
<p>I will organize as many mass log-outs, boycotts, and riots as it takes to get you to realize you did nothing but completely and utterly ruin the game.</p>
<p>Jagex, what can make you put RS back the way it was a year ago?</p>
