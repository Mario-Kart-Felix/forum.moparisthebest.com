    <description>Haha got it so hear it is.

Well, here it is. &gt;100% Credits to http://www.amaderforum.com&lt;

For many months now we&#39;ve been asked questions about what the plans are for the next release of SMF - what features it will have and when it will be available. We are now in a position to answer some of these questions. Simple Machines is proud to announce that the next version of SMF will be version 2.0 - in recognition of the scale of the changes implemented since SMF 1.1.

SMF 2.0 represents a significant step forward from the current version of SMF and has been in development alongside SMF 1.1 since December 2005. As well as adding new features SMF 2.0 makes considerable changes &quot;under the hood&quot; with improved caching, database abstraction and a move towards &quot;Model, View, Controller&quot; functions to improve integration and simplify mod writing. Whilst we are reluctant to announce all the features for this upcoming version the ones currently implemented include:

* Database abstraction - with support for PostgreSQL and SQLite planned alongside that of MySQL.
* Automatic installation of packages into themes other than just the default.
* Email templates to simplify customization of forum emails.
*&amp; Moderation center including post, topic and attachment moderation - to allow approving of user content before it is made public.
** User warning system.
* Additional group functionally including group moderators and requestable/free assignable groups.
* WYSIWYG editor to provide an intuitive user interface to those users not familiar with BBC.
* Permission improvements such as group inheritance and permission profiles to further reduce the complexity of the permissions system.
* File based caching for a performance increase on all forums regardless of whether an accelerator is installed.
* Mail queuing system to stagger the sending of emails to improve performance on large forums.
* Advanced signature settings to allow the administrator of a forum to more tightly control the contents of users signatures.
* Personal messaging improvements including ability to automatically sort incoming messages and a variety of display options.
* Improved upgrade script with better timeout protection and simpler user interface.
* Custom profile fields to enable administrators to add additional member fields from the administration center.


This is only a handful of the many improvements made in 2.0. Whilst we are not able to commit to a firm timetable for release of 2.0 we are hoping to get an initial beta in the hands of our Charter Members come June this year, with the first public beta likely to be around late October.

Edit-
DO NOT INSTALL TINYPORTAL. IT MAKES IT GO BACK TO V 1.1.4!!-

How to set it up-

1.Download smf and extract it to your desktop.-Now it should be in a folder on your desktop.
2.Now you need a FTP client.Go here and download it http://www.smartftp.com/download/.-The ftp manages your files.(it uploads your files to your domain)
3.Now you need a domain, theres lots of domains:Free: www.ulmb.com , www.awardspace.com &lt;---Recommended( theres many more just search free domain on google or for paid search for domains)
4.Once you have your domain you will have a sub domain e.g: hiyascape.awardspace.com this is where you will upload your files to.
5.Open up smart ftp on your desktop.
6.At the adress bar type your subdomain e.g. hiyascape.awardspace.com then put your password and user name you use for your domain (awardspace,ulmb)
7.There should be a folder with your sub domain on it now open up smf folder and drag the files in it and it will transfer.(may take a while)
8.Go to your subdomain and install smf.</description>

              <p>Heh, i did a few days ago and honestly… there is no real visual improvement apart from some fancy menus and improved moderation center things.<br>
But saying that, there is supposed to be some very good database, caching improvements and some other shiz which should get rid of some annoyances and may even, if moparisthebest decides to update to this version once its fully released it may even fix his banning problem.</p>
