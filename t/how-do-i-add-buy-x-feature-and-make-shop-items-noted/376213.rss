    <title>How do I add Buy X Feature and make shop items noted?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-add-buy-x-feature-and-make-shop-items-noted/376213</link>
    <description>Well I have some shops but I haven&#39;t figured out how to make a buy X feature for the items I&#39;ve put into a shop and make the items it sells noted... If someone could tell me what file to edit and what code I would use it would be GREATLY appreciated. Thank you.</description>
