    <title>How to load 525 npcs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-load-525-npcs/551739</link>
    <description>i am using xenon source and client and a lot of the npcs i spawn like the 948 mining instructor are invisible.
i figured its because i dont have the models needed in my cache so i thought if i find a npc 525 dump i could fix it.

can some one either:
help me get a 525 npc dumb and tell me how to add it or send a link to a guide?
or 
if it is possible to just dl a 525 cache and ripp it. please tell me the files that i need to take and add to my cache and where they go.
also will i have to go into my client files and do anything?

i just want my client/ cache to load all 525 npcs so that my npcs are not invisible.</description>

              <p>u need a working cache editor to add fully working 525 npcâ€™s so u have there correct areas to put them into  and u need to make sure that u have the correct ints and models for the npc and adding the animation that is used for the npc sometimes the animations is what makes your npc invisiable like the walking and standing animations in ur ints under ur entity.def</p>
