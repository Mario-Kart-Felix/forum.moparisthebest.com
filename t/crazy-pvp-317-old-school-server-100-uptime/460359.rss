Many servers that you experience today have mass amounts of grinding. Grinding leads to being bored which ultimately leads to quitting. At Crazy PvP, there&#39;s so much to do that you will never get bored.

Don&#39;t feel like training your combat? No worries, we&#39;ve got an amazing skilling system. Every skill is fully coded and unlike most servers, they actually make money!

Still not convinced? Take a look at our perfect combat system. Switches are wonderful and the hybridding switches are phenomenal. No dragging is always best, right?

Also, easy access to popular PK&#39;ing spots.
