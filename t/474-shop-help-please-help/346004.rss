    <title>474 Shop Help (Please help)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/474-shop-help-please-help/346004</link>
    <description>I am trying to make a Pk Equipment Shop in my 474 server, but I can&#39;t find out how to make it.  I found the file shops.cfg, and it has the shops in them, but I can&#39;t figure out how to add the shop id. Is there a certain file I have to find?</description>
