    <title>How to Port Forward with a Linksys router</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-port-forward-with-a-linksys-router/374146</link>
    <description>     Okay, so people always think Port Forwarding their RsPs is really difficult. I always thought so as well, until I did it. What you want to do is open up the &quot;Start&quot; menu, and look up cmd or command prompt.
Open it up and type in &quot;ipconfig&quot;

Now you&#39;ll need both the Default Gateway and last digits in your IPv4 address. 

     Now, you&#39;ll need to go to [url=http://192.168.1.1/]http://192.168.1.1/[/url]
You will be ask for a username/password. The default is Admin and admin as the password. If this is not correct, ask the person who set the router password and user.

     Once on the site, click &quot;Applications &amp; Gaming.&quot;
You&#39;ll see this:

     I have already filled it out.
In the name for the application, put whatever you want. Start and End ports should be 43594. On IP Address, put the last digits of your IPv4 address. Click enable, go to the bottom and hit save.

     There you go, that&#39;s how you Port Forward! It&#39;s really easy actually, so I hope this helped those who thought it hard.</description>
