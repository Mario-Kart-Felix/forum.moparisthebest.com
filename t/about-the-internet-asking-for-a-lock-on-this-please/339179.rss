    <description>PLEASE LOCK THIS

The answers to those and more are here. This was a hand written essay that I wrote, so about 98% Credits to Javafire(me DUH), and the rest to my father who is a SECURITY ADMINISTRATOR, THAT IS HIS JOB, I THINK HE KNOWS MORE THAN A TWELVE YEAR OLD SERVER HOST!

                       What is the Internet? [b]Basically[/b] (like rsps) the internet is a bunch of connected servers hosting a network (or a &quot;network of networks&quot;).

                       Who owns the Internet? The United States Government. Allthough it may seem like communism for the governemnt to think the internet is theirs, it basically is OWNED by them. Freedom of speech in America is alive still, and so censoring the internet here would be against the United States Constitution.
                &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. &quot; - the First Amendment

               How can you be traced? Well consider this, over three and a half million Americans are using software like frostwire/limewire/uTorrent to steal software right now. Over 30,000 of those people will be found by the end of the week and prosecuted.This is because the internet is monitored by the governemnt, you can&#39;t hide from them. If they find a site with any copyrighted material (and if the original company complains) they can shut you down in an instance. The reason this is non-prevalent in society is because the internet is too vast. The United States (who owns every single ip address, they just sell certain domains to companies like linksys) can and will find you if you live in this country. if you don&#39;t they can report you to other nations. Even though this is very unlikley that you will be found, it is a high risk. So whenever you are using illeagal software remember this. BE  (FUCKING) CAREFULL.

<p>what the hell are you talking about? Forget it i don’t need to waste my time with you. If you know it all then how come you’re stuck pirating software instead of owning software and becoming a name for yourself. I care about the rsps community. Because of what happend top frugooscape i don’t want to see it happen to my site, ect… To keep on the good side of things listen to me. Or you can listen to relmitos who has been on the internet studying on how to crack software and break copyrights.</p>

Stop trying to undermine me, you play by the rules you follow the rules you win and have a good life, you don’t well you’ll have a pretty deadbeat life. I can’t help but see that you play that way too <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

Cnn also is part of many tabloids, about a quater of their authors don’t have any progress working for cnn, plus they think global warming is real. You really need to stop telling me that about 98.9% of the IT and Server professionals out there can be ruled over by an article on cnn…</p>
<p>EDIT: and yes a few of my sources were wrong. the internet does have a few other owners. Comcast, At&amp;t and Verizon…</p>

              <p>[quote=“Javafire, post:1, topic:339179”]Ever wonder who owns the Internet?<br>
Ever wonder what the Internet is?<br>
How does the government trace you when copyright infrigment is detected?</p>
<p>The answers to those and more are here. This was a hand written essay that I wrote, so about 98% Credits to Javafire(me DUH), and the rest to my father who is a security administrator.</p>
<pre><code>                   What is the Internet? "The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) to serve billions of users worldwide" - Credits to OSCE Publication for this quote. So basically (like rsps) the internet is a bunch of connected servers hosting a network (or a "network of networks").

                   Who owns the Internet? The United States Government. Allthough it may seem like communism for the governemnt to think the internet is theirs, it basically is OWNED by them. Freedom of speech in America is alive still, and so censoring the internet here would be against the United States Constitution.
            "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. " - the First Amendment

           How can you be traced? Well consider this, over three and a half million Americans are using software like frostwire/limewire/uTorrent to steal software right now. Over 30,000 of those people will be found by the end of the week and prosecuted.This is because the internet is monitored by the governemnt, you can't hide from them. If they find a site with any copyrighted material (and if the original company complains) they can shut you down in an instance. The reason this is non-prevalent in society is because the internet is too vast. The United States (who owns every single ip address, they just sell certain domains to companies like linksys) can and will find you if you live in this country. if you don't they can report you to other nations. Even though this is very unlikley that you will be found, it is a high risk. So whenever you are using illeagal software remember this. BE  (FUCKING) CAREFULL.
</code></pre>
<p>Attatched is Copyright Laws[/quote]</p>
<p>They don’t go through linksys and stuff, they just go to your IPS like Comcast, others?, since they are the ones that control your internet with they many modems. I also have to say the government deregulated, giving them less power.</p>

The dumbass American government dose not own the internet. Everyone who host anything owns part of the internet. Nobody owns the internet at the same time millions of people own the internet. The United states government does not own the internet, if they did then they could shut it down anytime they wanted.(Which they cannot do.)<br>
[/quote] Thats a flat out lie. either that or you aren’t too bright. The government bought the servers that run the internet. Therfore they own the internet. The servers that CONNECT to the internet mainframe are only parts of the internet.[/quote]</p>
<p>If I host a website. It’s not the United States government, it’s mine, because they did not buy my server. Especially if I lived in a different country. I’m sorry but you are misinformed.</p>
