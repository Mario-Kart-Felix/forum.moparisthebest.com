    <title>First Official Alpha Information [Complete!]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/first-official-alpha-information-complete/549084</link>
    <description>[i]This alpha test is over and complete.[/i]

[hr]

Thank you for your interest in the MoparScape official server! Today marks a big day for the community, the first public alpha for the server. We don&#39;t expect this alpha to be live for very long, and accounts will be reset, but now is your chance to get a taste of how the official server will work when it gets closer to real launch day!

[b]The server is currently: OFFLINE[/b]

[size=14pt][u][b]Client Information[/b][/u][/size]
The version of the RuneScape we are using for the server is [b]530[/b]. This is based in[b] January, 2009[/b]; almost exactly 6 years ago. We apologize if you were expecting an &#39;older&#39; version.

[u][b]Loading the client[/b][/u]

Playing the game should be as simple as going to the [b]webclient[/b]. The webclient supports HD (but not fullscreen) for most platforms.
[b][i][url=http://game.moparisthebest.com]WEBCLIENT LINK[/url][/i][/b]
[size=8pt]Because of changes to Java security defaults, you may need to go to your Java settings (in your OS control panel), security tab, and then either change your security level to medium or add our site to your whitelist. [i][url=http://puu.sh/ekMbD/385f321618.png]Picture instructions[/url] [/i][/size]

If this still doesn&#39;t work for you, you can use the [b]downloadable client[/b]. 
[i][b][url=http://game.moparisthebest.com/moparscape_client.jar]DOWNLOAD LINK[/url][/b][/i]
[size=8pt]Note that the downloadable client does not support HD unless you download the JOGL binaries yourself and put them in your cache folder.[/size]

[u][b]Logging in[/b][/u]
For alpha, all registration is done in the client. When your client loads up, simply click on &#39;Create Account&#39; and follow the steps. 
Notes:

[ul][li]You must change your birth year to be 13 years of age or older.[/li]
[li]While the client text boxes allow special characters, they are not sent to the client and may cause your client to crash excessively when attempting to log in. It is suggested to follow the alphanumeric and underscore protocol for best success.[/li]
[li]It is very likely your account will crash the first time it logs in, and sometimes rarely after that. [/li]
[li]If your client crashes on every log in attempt, try to register a new account. If the problem persists, try the other client. (Webclient if using downloadable and vice-versa)[/li]
[li]If you still cannot log in, post a bug report with the username(s) you attempted to use, your computer specs (OS/browser especially), and your java version.[/li][/ul]


[size=14pt][u][b]Game Information[/b][/u][/size]

Though the main purpose of this alpha is to just test the server on a larger scale than the private alpha, there is still content for people to explore and test! A lot of the basic skills are functional and most of Varrock/Lumbridge spawns are complete (no NPC drops yet though except chickens for feathers for Fletching). We invite you to peruse the content we have done and suggest what content should be highest priority to add.


[size=14pt][u][b]Reporting Issues/Bugs/Missing content[/b][/u][/size]
Every issue you have can go in either a new thread or in [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=667957]this topic[/url]. If you post a new thread, it will likely be examined and then moved to the linked topic. Please feel free to post about anything we are missing or that you&#39;d like to see added to the server.</description>

              <p>I mean its a lot of design overhead. You have to spend a lot of determine reverse engineering their solution based upon observed behavior. Compared to designing a solution that fits your parameters. Sometimes I think you don’t really understand the economics of design much and you have a sadistic attitude about making yourself spend so much time trying to be as ‘close’ to the real rendition when its just a facade.</p>

<p>What would it matter? That just has a lot of overhead? It’s easier logically determining a solution that makes sense rather than trying to fit a solution that was logically determined by the parameters for design they had available.</p>

              <p>I don’t know enough about that era to confirm but it should be the same for both they just sent a special amount varilable for the infinite. however if its not the case if you wanted a quickfix no cache editing approach just add some hardcoded interface changes if id remove tab 0 set tab 1 to 0 and rename player stock to main stock.</p>

They would have no reason to completely remove the feature they created the infinity stock to deal with shop bots as I recall. I mean if you are going for the completely authentic feel by all means keep the infinite stock but if you wanted to use the old system you probably still can with little effort.[/quote]Oh you definitely can, that’s the “player” stock tab in the interface, which I still have. I was just seeing if there was a way for the ‘main’ stock to be part infinite and part not, but I don’t think there is.</p>

<p>[/quote]<br>
I may be wrong but I am sure to set the shop value to infinity you would just send -1 for the amount they still had player instanced shops for certain things as I recall not to mention some shops had limitations regardless of being infinite.[/quote]My memory is always a little jumbled when we go back that far, but I found this on the wiki:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Every store’s stock is unique to each player. When a player buys or sells items to a shop, the quantity available to other players remains unchanged. This feature was changed as of an update on <span class="bbcode-b">2 September 2009</span>. Prior to this, most shops sold an infinite quantity of certain smaller items. </span></p>
<p>This revision (530) is ~January 2009, so I found the historical wiki page from 2008 and read this:<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">A Shop (or Store North American usage [1]) is any place where players can buy items, usually including a Main Stock (which has infinite quantities, but sells at higher prices) and a Player Stock (which can offer lower prices, but quantities vary according to how many items players have sold there). </span></p>
<p>So the limits were added later, after that.</p>

What exactly am I claiming as my own? I never said I wrote the base, I simply think it’s hilarious you think what little work you put into the base is the ‘core’ of all the development. A lot of what you did had to be either completely rewritten or has been phased out. The “research” you did was what? What exactly did you do that you put into the base, that wasn’t already readily available? Do you actually have anything that I haven’t mentioned and given credit for, or do you just find it fun to make yourself feel good by trying to say your work got stolen and your work was super important to development?</p>
