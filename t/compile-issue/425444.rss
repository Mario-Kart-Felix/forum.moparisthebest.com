    <title>Compile Issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/compile-issue/425444</link>
    <description>I recently dloaded a source/client that is wonderful. Perfect for me with only a year of coding under my belt. 
I notice the compiler compiles a lot of things, like I can change about anything in my character profile, NPC Spawn...
But anything else I have changed does not compile....
Things such as added objects, doors, ladders, stairs, shop changes, text changes, load screen text changes, etc. 
All the compiler says is &quot;Press any key to continue.....&quot; And that is even when I deliberately jack a page to get errors. 

Does anyone understand why some things compile and others do not? Would greatly appreciate the help  :)</description>

              <p>[quote=“FFkingdom, post:2, topic:425477”]My environment is set to JDK1.7.0_01 (Classpath and path) for my friends game, cause “That is all it will run on” as he put it. I just usually change the compiler to match, and bammo done.<br>
That is what I know how to do. Like I said before, if there is no issue, I do not usually tamper with them. And thus never really took the time to learn how they are done.<br>
Since there are two, I will give both, and let it go at that.</p>
<p>This is what the first compiler has for code: (Never used cause it did not run from the git go)</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/echo">@echo</a> off<br>
“C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_21\bin\javac.exe” -classpath deps/log4j-1.2.15.jar;deps/jython.jar;deps/xstream.jar;deps/mina.jar;deps/mysql.jar;deps/poi.jar;deps/slf4j.jar;deps/slf4j-nop.jar -d bin src\server\event*.java src\server\model\items*.java src\server\model\minigames*.java src\server\model\npcs*.java src\server\model\objects*.java src\server\model\players*.java src\server\model\players\skills*.java src\server\model\players\packets*.java src\server\model\shops*.java src\server\net*.java src\server\task*.java src\server\util*.java src\server\world*.java src\server\util\log*.java src\server*.java src\server\world\map*.java<br>
pause</p>
<p>The second one located in another folder, the one that does sort of work has this:</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/echo">@echo</a> off<br>
Title Compiler<br>
“C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_20\bin\javac.exe” *.java<br>
pause</p>
<p>Both java types are in the pc. And that is where I am just lost. I apologize for being new at this portion of games. I was just looking for some assistance, and hopefully learn a bit more while I am at it.<br>
lol btw Native American/German ;D[/quote]Is this for RSC, and not a 317 or some other RS2 crap?</p>
<p>I’m asking because I don’t recall any servers with that structure, or requiring Jython.</p>
