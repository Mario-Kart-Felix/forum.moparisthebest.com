    <title>[Delta] 317 Adding Custom Weapons [Source Sided]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-317-adding-custom-weapons-source-sided/506685</link>
    <description>I added the models in raw folder, i never had a raw folder so i just simply made one and added the models in there. 

I did everything changed item id to lower because my delta can only hold 10000. I added it Client sided no problem.

When i go on my account or any, the screen turns black an says connection error and i stay like that without getting out or in.

Please, i read the cmd and it says itemhandler i looked and their isn&#39;t anything wrong. Theirs a maxitem; 10000, and i added the items in item.cfg and it has 6505 items (including the new custom weapon)</description>
