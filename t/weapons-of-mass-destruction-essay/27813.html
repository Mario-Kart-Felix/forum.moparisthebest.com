<p>[center]Weapons of Mass Destruction[/center]</p>
<p>How safe do you think you are in the world, today? New threats have emerged over the last decade. These threats, weapons of mass destruction, can no longer be ignored. War has forced the development of these weapons, from the first bone clubs which had been used by man for survival, to the complex and highly destructive weapons of today. This century has witnessed the most advanced development in the technology of warfare since the age of gunpowder. For the first time in history, weapons have been made that can instantly eliminate any nation, killing thousands of millions of people.</p>
<p>Weapons of mass destruction are capable of indiscriminately killing large numbers of living human beings at one time. These weapons include biological, chemical, nuclear, and radioactive weapons. The term, weapons of mass destruction, had first arisen in 1936 in reference to the mass destruction of Guernica, Spain by aerial bombing from German and Italian forces. As the term became wide known, it was often abbreviated as WMD. There are two types of bombs categorized as weapons of mass destruction; they are fission bombs, also called atomic bombs, and fusion bombs, which are hydrogen bombs. These bombs release lethal doses of radiation on impact; the radioactive material kills instantly as it spreads. The only country that has used a weapon of mass destruction against an opponent is the United States. The weapon, an atomic bomb, was used during World War II and killed over 200,000 Japanese civilians. The result of using any weapons of mass destruction is so devastating, that laws have been passed preventing the creation of them without proper authority. The United States, China, France, India, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, and the United Kingdom are the only nations that have declared that they possess nuclear weapons and have performed tests on them. Only 5 of which are members of the NPT, or Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The random impacts and fear of WMD have formed many political policies and campaigns, fostered social movements, and have been the central theme of many films.</p>
<p>Weapons of mass destruction are a probable weapon of choice that will be used by terrorists. It has been debated over by many intellectuals that terrorists will choose to use WMD as their future weapons because it would enable them to cause worldwide fear, and inflict greater numbers of casualties. According to the authors, Vinod Jain and Bharati Dhruva, “Terrorists may favor chemical and biological weapons because they are inexpensive to produce, highly toxic, and extremely difficult to detect” (Weapons of Mass Destruction: Opposing Viewpoints). This is important to know because the United States and the other countries must try to prevent terrorists from acquiring, gaining access to, or using weapons of mass destruction to cause havoc and fear. If terrorist organizations had gained access to weapons of mass destruction, they could release lethal bacteria and viruses in highly populated areas. This would cause widespread disease or death because the harmful substances are very contagious. The U.S. Undersecretary of State, John Bolton, said, “I don’t have any doubt that al-Queda was pursuing nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare capabilities. It’s not our judgement at the moment that they were that far along, but I have no doubt that they were seeking to do so” (InfoTrac). This suggests that al-Queda was attempting to create WMD and if they had successfully created them they would be used or sold to terrorists. Weapons of mass destruction have made many problems arise because now there is constant fear that terrorists may one day obtain weapons of mass destruction and use them against the United States government or any other nation’s government. Fox news had reported that, “Terrorists involving biological or chemical weapons can range from putting deadly substances in the nation’s food supply to the aerosolized release of a contagious virus over the city the size of New York or San Francisco” (Fox news). This shows that there are different types of WMD and each can be used to kill large amounts of people. The WMD could be a silent threat or could be a large impact that can kill all of the people in a city in an instant or in due time. If these weapons were released, it would disrupt the local economy because all personals would have to be evacuated to stop contamination. “The future may see a time when such a nuclear weapon may be constructed in secret and used suddenly and effectively with devastating power by a willful nation or group against an unsuspecting nation or group of much greater size,” commented the U.S. Secretary of War, Henry Stimson. This clearly explains why people are getting suspicious of other countries and more worried about the possible fact that terrorists might use weapons of mass destruction. Terrorists are the prime suspects because of the risk of them choosing to use WMD to force their ways and create worldwide panic. It would be a likely choice for terrorists because they can kill tens of thousands of people in one single incident.</p>
<p>The effects of weapons of mass destruction could be devastating, such effects would be large-scale killings, global panic, spread of biohazardous chemicals, and worldwide conflicts resulting in an apocalypse. However, weapons of mass destruction have strategic benefits in their use in global politics and warfare. Therefore, these weapons are the most effective way to neutralize, immobilize, and terrify any nation’s enemy into instant submission. These weapons were made for a good cause first, but would do more bad than good if used in the wrong hands. According to Jennifer A. Hurley, author of Weapons of Mass Destruction: Opposing Viewpoints, “World conflicts that involve the use of weapons of mass destruction can lead to widespread annihilation, or even an apocalypse” (Weapons of Mass Destruction: Opposing Viewpoints). This proves that WMD are very dangerous and can destroy large populations of people. It also explains that if countries engaged in a world-conflict involving the use of weapons of mass destruction, it could result in the destruction of many countries. Fox news has reported that, “Weapons of mass destruction include biological, chemical, nuclear, and radiological devices and range from being a silent threat of a poison gas attack to that of a cataclysmic nuclear explosion” (Fox news). This is important because now the variety of weapons of mass destruction is known and the United States and other nations could try to prevent the use of them. Fox news has explained that these weapons of mass destruction can range from being a slowly-killing threat to a quickly-killing threat. In an online article, it states, “100 warheads are said to have the capacity to destroy the United States and civilization as we know it” (InfoTrac). This explains that if one nation was powerful enough, it could destroy neighboring countries or force them to comply with its requests. WMD could do sever damage to a country causing a worldwide conflict to arise because other nations would want to get involved for the resources that might be gained. These weapons of mass destruction would cause fear for countries that did not have possession of any. An online source noted that, “Weapon inspections conducted after the war in Iraq have revealed extensive efforts by Saddam Hussein to build chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, which could have been used against the United States or sold to anti-American terrorists” (Infotrac). This shows that there could be the possibility of terrorists gaining access to WMD and there is no telling of what they do at any given moment or opportunity. However, international cooperation has so far prevented the use of nuclear weapons and ensured the strengthening of nuclear security. Weapons of mass destruction should not have been created because they have caused so many problems. The effects of WMD can be seen during a bombing in World War II resulting in 200,000 Japanese casualties. If anyone would choose to use weapons of mass destruction for their benefit only, it could hurt the economy and spread international alarm.</p>
<p>While some people and countries believe the risk of terrorists acquiring weapons of mass destruction is high, others do not and show no concern about it.  Terrorists would probably not make their own weapons of mass destruction because the production and dissemination are far more complicated than what everyone has been lead to believe. Instead the threat stems from terrorists acquiring, or stealing nuclear weapons from other countries. Ehud Sprinzak says, “The threat of terrorist attacks using weapons of mass destruction has been overstated. Despite incidents such as the 1995 attack in a Tokyo subways station and the current claims of government officials and politicians, conventional weapons such as car bombs continue to pose a greater danger than biological or chemical weapons” (InfoTrac). This shows that some people still do not believe that terrorist will use WMD and will only use their previous and effective ways for creating panic. In an online article, it said, “There is no evidence that terrorists have used weapons of mass destruction or that they were involved in anthrax attacks” (Fpc). Another online article stated that, “The risk of terrorists using weapons of mass destruction is low” (Unodc). This proves that people do not believe and do not want to believe that terrorists may use weapons of mass destruction one day. They are already afraid of the disastrous effects of previous terrorist attacks, and don’t want to think of terrorists using WMD. According to an online document, “The death polls from the September 2001 attacks represented nothing less than an abrupt change (quantum-leap) in terms of terrorists casualties, and this suggesting WMD might be a future weapon used for terrorism” (InfoTrac). This explains that the possibility of terrorists using WMD is still high, but does not mean that terrorists will disregard or abandon their previous ways of creating terror. People should not e concerned because the United States government has strengthened its defenses and gone after the terrorists. An online article, Global Terrorism, stated, “Weapons of mass destruction will be the terrorists’ weapons of choice because they can force their ways and demand anything” (Globalterrorism101). This shows what terrorists can do if they use WMD, but still considering the risk that terrorists might use WMD is low. There are some facts shown here suggesting that terrorists will not use WMD and will not try to obtain these weapons because of the United States and other nations combined efforts and attempts on stopping them.</p>
<p>Weapons of mass destruction have created a huge impact on society. It has been discussed often on news stations, TV channels, and political elections as well as in movies. Although the effects of using weapons of mass destruction are devastating, they might be used to negotiate with other nations to stop outbreaks of war. Many people do think terrorists will gain access to weapons of mass destruction, but the possibility of that is unmistakably low. Countries have worked together to make the world safer by going after terrorists and making sure that no one constructs weapons of mass destruction without asking for permission. This term, weapons of mass destruction, is discussed often because of the concern associated with it.</p>
