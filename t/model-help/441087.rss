    <description>I dont know what up my source asss, but when i added my custom item, i wear it in the right spot. but when i look in my inventory.. My items are in the wrong spot. i&#39;ve changed everything in item.java, cant seem to know what the problem is. anyone who knows can you please get at this post asap. if you didn&#39;t understand i will explain or post a pic up.

**Edit, Nvm Fixed. For those who wants to know what i did wrong and if u did wrong to you have to input the items in item.cfg also before it can be changed.</description>
