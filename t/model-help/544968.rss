    <description>Hey everyone I have been using Aggroth V2 (I know it&#39;s not the best to use but i just wanted to mess around) and I ran into a problem that I have never seen before. Watch the video and see what happens when I wear the items I added in. [youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZUuEdFyuM&amp;feature=youtu.be[/youtube]

The ints I used are

[code]case 614:
		itemDef.modelid = 24;
		itemDef.name = &quot;Double Halo Sword&quot; ;
		itemDef.description = &quot;A Flapping Awesome Sword&quot;;
		itemDef.modelZoom = 1616;
		itemDef.modelRotationY = 396;
		itemDef.modelRotationX = 1050;
		itemDef.modelOffset1 = 4;
		itemDef.modelOffset2 = -3;
		itemDef.anInt165 = 25;
		itemDef.anInt200 = 25;
		itemDef.groundActions = new String[5];
		itemDef.groundActions[2] = &quot;Take&quot;;
		itemDef.itemActions = new String[5];
		itemDef.itemActions[1] = &quot;Wear&quot;;
		itemDef.itemActions[4] = &quot;Drop&quot;;
		break;
[/code]

From what I know the .dat I used is correct and I even found it being released with the same .dat for the double halo so if anyone could help me with this I would appreciate it! c:</description>

<p>That model is being overwritten by a different model in the client.</p>
