    <description>So I followed this tutorial : http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-client/models/114285-barbarian-assault-npcs-models-ints.html

I did everything the tut told, but when I spawned the npcs they didn&#39;t look like the barb assault npcs at all. In fact they are just some weird things. Now my guess is that i&#39;ve put the models in the wrong place. I honestly don&#39;t know but it must be a problem with the models.

please help?

in other words: I just don&#39;t know what to do with my npc models.</description>
