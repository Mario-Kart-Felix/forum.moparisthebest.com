    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-require-a-little-assistance-please/10900</link>
    <description>Greetings...
Although my Java skills are pretty advanced, my understanding on RuneScape Private Servers Isn&#39;t.

I&#39;m using Xerozcheez&#39;s &quot;PK&quot; Version of a server as my &quot;Base&quot; since his server is pretty much
The best one out there. (Thanks Xerozcheez)

Though I&#39;m not having any problems with that, I&#39;m re-writing the entire client file
(Currently 25201 lines of code)

One thing I would appreciate to know...

I&#39;d like to make the item 7462 operational...

Every good item is already in the server except this one... the best gloves... the Barrows Gloves.

[code]item = 7462	Gloves	A_pair_of_very_nice_gloves.100000	40000	60000	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0[/code]

The 12 Zero&#39;s are the stats... these gloves should be: 12 12 12 6 12 12 12 12 6 12 12 0
(This isn&#39;t the problem though)

Though something I do NOT know is the first 3 huge numbers that I’m presented with...
(the 100000, 40000 &amp; 60000)

The gloves work Fine, they Equip to the glove slot and they give the bonuses...
but Them 3 big numbers confuse me.

So what I would like to know...

1. What do the 3 huge numbers in the code represent?
2. How to stop clipping occurring (hair through dmed) &amp; character through clothes (infinity, fremennik)
3. How to give my male character a &quot;Chin&quot; (females have one, why dont males?&quot;)

If someone can answer me these questions then I will be greatly appreciative.</description>

<p>Clipping = hair comming though D Med or your face comming through torags helm or your shoulders comming through infinity top…</p>
<p>With every item defined to the correct slot in the cfg they still “clip” through the character</p>

<p>Now what ever u want that clips… Add the number in it… So lets say u want infinity body to not clip</p>
<p>you would do this [CODE]public static int body[] = {6916,6654,7390,7392,7362,7364,7399,7374,7376,7372,7370,1035,540,5553,4757,1833,6388,6384,2501,2499,4111,4101,4091,6186,6184,6180,3058,4509,4504,4069,4728,4736,4712,6107,2661,3140,1101,1103,1105,1107,1109,1111,1113,1115,1117,1119,1121,1123,1125,1127,1129,1131,1133,1135,2499,2501,2503,2583,2591,2599,2607,2615,2623,2653,2669,3387,3481,4712,4720,4728,4749,4892,4893,4894,4895,4916,4917,4918,4919,4964,4965,4966,4967,6107,6133,6322,6916};</p>
<p>[/code] As u can see i added 6916 at the end</p>
<p>3 and 4 i dont no… But if u want bes ring to have stats… You would add it under [CODE] Public static int ring[] = { #</p>

              <p>Well as I said, I’m a fairly good Programmer but when it comes to RuneScape things I’m pretty dumb. Hence why I’m asking the questions…</p>
<p>Which files control the items in the game?</p>
<p>Item.cfg - tells the game the item ID, Name, Examine Info, Stats<br>
Item.java - (later compiled into item.class) puts the items in a specific group</p>
<p>So far this is the only 2 files I have used regarding items, such as the Barrows Gloves which I have added and work 100%<br>
The ring works in all aspect, you can spawn it, you can wear it, goes in the ring slot…<br>
It just doesn’t give any stats, but I have already defined the stats in item.cfg</p>
<p>As for a Chin on Male characters you can get one by having a script that lets you change your character look but why doesn’t the default chin have anything</p>
<p>Still answers to my first question still required…</p>
<ol>
<li>What do the first 3 numbers in the item stats code (item.cfg) represent?</li>
<li>How to stop clipping occurring (hair through dmed) &amp; character through clothes (infinity, fremennik)</li>
<li>How to give my male character a “Chin” (females have one, why don’t males?")</li>
<li>What does Deob mean (deobfuscated) I know the word just not what it means.</li>
</ol>
<p>And you can’t call me a stupid noob asking questions as a noob wouldn’t even know about these files in the first place so some support would be greatly appreciated and I’m sure many more people want to know the answers too.[br][size=1]Posted at: August 26, 2006, 05:48:06 PM[/size][hr]Still no answer?</p>

              <p>Ahh, I will test this out.<br>
Change the numbers around and see what the items sell for and alch for.<br>
Will post results immediatly after.[br][size=1]Posted at: August 25, 2006, 06:18:48 AM[/size][hr]Okay, various testing shows that the 3 digits do not report money values at all because some of them are like this “10874.2774” and you do not get Decimals in money for RuneScape.</p>
<p>The numbers of some items i have low alched and high alched are also WAY off the numbers in the list so what them numbers mean are still a mystery to me</p>
<p>Still wanna know why the stats to the Berserker Ring isn’t adding any values to my character, when the ring is equipped it gives nothing whatsoever…</p>
<p>Has to be SOME semi-intelligent people on this site that can help me out</p>

              <p>Okay well I don’t know what “Deob” means.<br>
In most of my programming years I cannot recall comming across this word.</p>
<p>Anyhow, when browsing the games objects in the item.cfg File Here is what I worked out</p>
<p>“item =” ID - Name - Description - ? - ? - ? - atk stab - atk slash - atk crush - atk ranged - atk magic - def stab - def slash - def crush - def ranged - def magic - strength bonus - prayer bonus</p>
<p>I want to know what the 3 “?'s” mean, what them numbers represent…</p>
<p>I have a new problem (along with the rest) with a new item (unlike the Barrows gloves which work straight away)<br>
The Berserker Ring stats 0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,4,0. I updated the stats in the [color=blue]item.cfg[/color] file and added the item ID to the “rings” secton in the [color=blue]item.java[/color] file.</p>
<p>In-game the ring is there, and equips in the rings slot but it has no stats, all of them say 0 even though I have specified all of them… What’s happening here?</p>
<p>So once again, How to fix the “Chin” on the male character, how to fix “clipping” of the character and various equipment, what the 3 numbers in the file i explained earlier mean and finally how to make my ring have working bonuses… because i’ve double-checkjed everything and it’s not working…</p>

              <p>Greetings…<br>
Although my Java skills are pretty advanced, my understanding on RuneScape Private Servers Isn’t.</p>
<p>I’m using Xerozcheez’s “PK” Version of a server as my “Base” since his server is pretty much<br>
The best one out there. (Thanks Xerozcheez)</p>
<p>Though I’m not having any problems with that, I’m re-writing the entire client file<br>
(Currently 25201 lines of code)</p>
<p>One thing I would appreciate to know…</p>
<p>I’d like to make the item 7462 operational…</p>
<p>Every good item is already in the server except this one… the best gloves… the Barrows Gloves.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">item = 7462	Gloves	A_pair_of_very_nice_gloves.100000	40000	60000	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0</code></pre>
<p>The 12 Zero’s are the stats… these gloves should be: 12 12 12 6 12 12 12 12 6 12 12 0<br>
(This isn’t the problem though)</p>
<p>Though something I do NOT know is the first 3 huge numbers that I’m presented with…<br>
(the 100000, 40000 &amp; 60000)</p>
<p>The gloves work Fine, they Equip to the glove slot and they give the bonuses…<br>
but Them 3 big numbers confuse me.</p>
<p>So what I would like to know…</p>
<ol>
<li>What do the 3 huge numbers in the code represent?</li>
<li>How to stop clipping occurring (hair through dmed) &amp; character through clothes (infinity, fremennik)</li>
<li>How to give my male character a “Chin” (females have one, why dont males?")</li>
</ol>
<p>If someone can answer me these questions then I will be greatly appreciative.</p>
