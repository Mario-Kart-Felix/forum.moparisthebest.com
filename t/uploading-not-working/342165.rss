    <description>When I try to upload it just says in error has occured( using both mediafire and megaupload) I have uploaded before with no problems. I think it might be that my free trail with winrar is up, but I can still run the program. Any one know what&#39;s up?</description>

              <p>post your process with a few pics on how you compress your folder. Obviously you did it wrong<br>
just to clarify:</p>
<p>right click the folder<br>
select send to<br>
choose compressed<br>
wait for load<br>
upload that thing you just compressed</p>
<p>now before you avoid work and say you did that, you still should tell us your process</p>
