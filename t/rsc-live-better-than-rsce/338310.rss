    <description>*

 Economy will never be flooded with high alch prices and rares (Like rsce did)
Staff actually help the players and give them 100% support (Unlike luke)

24-7 DDoS protection Hosted By Staminus with Secureport. Here to stay

OVER 65,000 IP&#39;s banned (Because of Luke)

F2P wild, Daily F2p wars and Tournaments! Not even close to as much lagg as RSCE. Better community, Bot protection that actually works, Secure, We dont focus on things you care nothing about (Like RSCE), We like to keep the players happy. Come join the hundreds who have already made the switch! 


If you think you &quot;own&quot; players, Think again. People do what they want. If they come to lets say RSC-Live, and like it better than that server RSCE or whatever, That&#39;s their choice. Try and stop us from spreading the word. I&#39;ve been accused of alot of things by luke. To be completely honest i do not have any respect for Luke(kryptix) or his server.  RSC-Live has been up for a month and has peaked 76, with many new players joining every day. Thanks everybody for spamming RSCE, As it has brought me many new players who now feel the same way about which server is better.

I&#39;ve had my topic locked for nothing, And I&#39;ve been attacked directly by Luke and others. I joined this forum because it seemed like a popular place. Turns out it is very unprofessional. I&#39;ll continue getting my players by spamming RSCE. Thanks.

And for the record, I&#39;ve never asked, Payed, Or told anybody to spam any particular server Until this last few days.


Also, Luke stop acting like Zilent is anyone other than Hixk</description>
