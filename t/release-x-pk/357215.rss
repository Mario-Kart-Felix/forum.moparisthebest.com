    <description>..X-PK 199 Server &amp; Client Sauce..

UPDATES:

Custom client control panel with outgoing packet monitor.

*Full player saving/loading, 
 All stats, Exp, Items, Counts, Weilded, Bank Items ect
 Skulled, CurrentX, Y, Password, Rank.

Ranks:
0 = Normal, 1 = Mod, 2 = Admin, 3 = Muted, 4 = Banned, 5 = Permanantly Banned

Login handlers, Invalid Password, Already logged in, Banned, Perm Banned.
Multiple spaces in a username get shortened to one space, and invalid chars get converted
to &quot;&quot;, ex: Hey@Hello = HeyHello


FULL eating/food, amountofhp stored in food/healing.ini
Full burying
FULL item weild defs, stored in Req/Attack.ini || Defense.ini || Magic.ini || Ranged.ini

PingPong: (Bugged - turned off, see bugs)
USAGE:
	Loops every (specified time) to ensure that the players clients
	are still in contact with the server, purpose is, to drop clients
	that aren&#39;t connected, and also changing their online status
	thus to allow them to re-log in and freeing up user space.
- Can turn this on by unblanking new pingPongTimer() in client.java to see how it runs

Full banking: (Replaced with report abuse button)
  Fixed bugs such as when depositing items they stay weilded,
    and if you deposit an item that is before an item in you inventory
       the items after go back a slot, fixed the bug of welding -1 back

Banking uses ::withdraw, ::deposit, stackables and unstackables. (100% no bugs found)
Added Dropping, also with the bug fixes above.

Autosaves/loads. when log in / out (plus pingpong)

Commands:
::save, ::say, ::skull, ::unskull, ::deposit, ::withdraw, ::coords, ::tele, ::setstat, ::pickup

Bakatools fighting system (bugged) needs to be stopped when the opponent dies, shouldn&#39;t be hard. cbf.

Still tells you which packets aren&#39;t implemented.

Added full item Bonuses, magic, prayer, weaponaim, weapon power, armour (%100 working)

All welding/removing/destroying functions have been fully re-written by myself.

Custom Stat menu, removed quest menu.
ONLY combat skills are in this server.

Custom Lootbox(not finished) in the picture below.
The idea for this was a budget way around item dropping, and a few other things, when you pk someone,
you get a certain lootcut, depending on level difference, plus you get the opponenets lootbox cash,
and also if you are skulled and die, the opponent recieves your entire lootbox, food and pots will go into their inventory plus the rest of your inventory items (in cash)
added to their lootbox. (can only be deposited out of the wilderness).
Level 25 prayer would protect a specified percentage of your losses.
(Just for show atm)

All custom buttons/images for client, and alot of the functions have been re-done in the client,
refactor log included, plus all renamed classes.

Remember both this server&amp;client were completely blank before I started this.

Uh, theres probably a ton i&#39;ve missed out, i&#39;ve stopped developing this for now because of a few bugs
i&#39;ve run into that are just too timeconsuming and I lack in the skill to correct it.

Errors:
Skulling, Skulls everybody, not just yourself, and your the only one that can see them.
Must be some sort of clientside error.

Pingpong system, works 100% flawless for 1 person online, but any more the loops must cross or somthing
and it keeps disconnecting the 2nd player joined.
So i&#39;ve turned it off. 

Combat level updates, only you can see, others can&#39;t until you re-log I think. 
uh that&#39;s all i can think of off the top of my head.

Credits, Bakatool, and myself, and a few friends for helping with some functions.


Have fun, If you have the time, compare it to shangtsungs src on here to see how much it&#39;s changed / been rewritten.
I started this barely knowing any java skills, so im pretty proud of myself :P


thanks.</description>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/the_afker">@The_AFKer</a> - Nono, the loop sends a packet, Client sends one back, the timer is the amount of time it<br>
gives to keep sending them, but if they don’t get one back (in the specified time), it can determine wether<br>
the client logged out, or dropped/closed client, plus it saves before it kicks the player.<br>
It’s great, be even better if it worked properly :P, use one player you’ll get the idea of it.</p>

              <p>Regarding the PingPong system you have going: Curious as to why you have it loop at a specified time when communicating with the client and server, what if the client lags out? Does it try to keep the connection alive or just drop the user’s session? How does it handle saving in this instance?</p>
<p>P.S: No I’m not trying to be a dick or downer, actually impressed someone managed to advance the server in another language than pure Java.</p>

How did you go about starting this? Just look at other sources and get a feel for how things should look and refer back to them when needed?

              <p>…X-PK 199 Server &amp; Client Sauce…</p>
<p>UPDATES:</p>
<p>Custom client control panel with outgoing packet monitor.</p>
<p>*Full player saving/loading,<br>
All stats, Exp, Items, Counts, Weilded, Bank Items ect<br>
Skulled, CurrentX, Y, Password, Rank.</p>
<p>Ranks:<br>
0 = Normal, 1 = Mod, 2 = Admin, 3 = Muted, 4 = Banned, 5 = Permanantly Banned</p>
<p>Login handlers, Invalid Password, Already logged in, Banned, Perm Banned.<br>
Multiple spaces in a username get shortened to one space, and invalid chars get converted<br>
to “”, ex: Hey@Hello = HeyHello</p>
<p>FULL eating/food, amountofhp stored in food/healing.ini<br>
Full burying<br>
FULL item weild defs, stored in Req/Attack.ini || Defense.ini || Magic.ini || Ranged.ini</p>
<p>PingPong: (Bugged - turned off, see bugs)<br>
USAGE:<br>
Loops every (specified time) to ensure that the players clients<br>
are still in contact with the server, purpose is, to drop clients<br>
that aren’t connected, and also changing their online status<br>
thus to allow them to re-log in and freeing up user space.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can turn this on by unblanking new pingPongTimer() in client.java to see how it runs</li>
</ul>
<p>Full banking: (Replaced with report abuse button)<br>
Fixed bugs such as when depositing items they stay weilded,<br>
and if you deposit an item that is before an item in you inventory<br>
the items after go back a slot, fixed the bug of welding -1 back</p>
<p>Banking uses ::withdraw, ::deposit, stackables and unstackables. (100% no bugs found)<br>
Added Dropping, also with the bug fixes above.</p>
<p>Autosaves/loads. when log in / out (plus pingpong)</p>
<p>Commands:<br>
::save, ::say, ::skull, ::unskull, ::deposit, ::withdraw, ::coords, ::tele, ::setstat, ::pickup</p>
<p>Bakatools fighting system (bugged) needs to be stopped when the opponent dies, shouldn’t be hard. cbf.</p>
<p>Still tells you which packets aren’t implemented.</p>
<p>Added full item Bonuses, magic, prayer, weaponaim, weapon power, armour (%100 working)</p>
<p>All welding/removing/destroying functions have been fully re-written by myself.</p>
<p>Custom Stat menu, removed quest menu.<br>
ONLY combat skills are in this server.</p>
<p>Custom Lootbox(not finished) in the picture below.<br>
The idea for this was a budget way around item dropping, and a few other things, when you pk someone,<br>
you get a certain lootcut, depending on level difference, plus you get the opponenets lootbox cash,<br>
and also if you are skulled and die, the opponent recieves your entire lootbox, food and pots will go into their inventory plus the rest of your inventory items (in cash)<br>
added to their lootbox. (can only be deposited out of the wilderness).<br>
Level 25 prayer would protect a specified percentage of your losses.<br>
(Just for show atm)</p>
<p>All custom buttons/images for client, and alot of the functions have been re-done in the client,<br>
refactor log included, plus all renamed classes.</p>
<p>Remember both this server&amp;client were completely blank before I started this.</p>
<p>Uh, theres probably a ton i’ve missed out, i’ve stopped developing this for now because of a few bugs<br>
i’ve run into that are just too timeconsuming and I lack in the skill to correct it.</p>
<p>Errors:<br>
Skulling, Skulls everybody, not just yourself, and your the only one that can see them.<br>
Must be some sort of clientside error.</p>
<p>Pingpong system, works 100% flawless for 1 person online, but any more the loops must cross or somthing<br>
and it keeps disconnecting the 2nd player joined.<br>
So i’ve turned it off.</p>
<p>Combat level updates, only you can see, others can’t until you re-log I think.<br>
uh that’s all i can think of off the top of my head.</p>

<p>Credits, Bakatool, and myself, and a few friends for helping with some functions.</p>
<p>Have fun, If you have the time, compare it to shangtsungs src on here to see how much it’s changed / been rewritten.<br>
I started this barely knowing any java skills, so im pretty proud of myself <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>thanks.</p>
