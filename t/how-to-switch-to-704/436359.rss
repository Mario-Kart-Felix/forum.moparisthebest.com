L0L, kid, go to my server, i have added three times as much as there was when you gave me the server. Fuck off, your a shitty server owner and do not deserve the money you get from donations, all you do is waste it on weed. GTFO THE FORUMS GUY.<br>

<p>Your the only child here. reacting like this ? u couldnt code the 637 loading 639 (dementhium) BCUZ u actually couldn’t code anything. so please stop reacting to ppl who are needing help. there are lots of things u couldn’t do. u couldn’t make a nex thats why u switched to matrix. and de-repping ppl for that really fails bro. now click the logout button pls.</p>

<p>You just lost the respect you gained from me although it doesn’t matter. You complete and utter arse.<br>
Also, buying and selling isn’t aloud on the forums so don’t encourage rule breaking.<br>
Now you sir, gtfo the forums. Was wondering why you don’t seem to be especially liked although your server seems nice, after this post i’ve read by you I wonder why and its not for the fact people claim you buy it all.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I honestly could care less if I lost your “respect”<br>
This kid has alot coming to him and for good reason.<br>
Just as well, OBVIOUSLY I have no intention of selling this kid anything, I was pointing out that he’s a moron and likes to buy shit off people, add a shop, than take 100% credit for it.</p>
<p>The reason I AM ALLOWED to be an asshole to this kid, is because he’s a fucking bloody moron.<br>
Disagree?<br>
Cool, I don’t give a fuck lol.[/quote]<br>
Thats why I said it doesn’t matter but you should care, you just have crap morals. Well you haven’t stated why rofl, all you seem to be moaning about is he bought stuff of you and you want him to buy more stuff of you which makes you seem like an ass cause your raging about it. Obviously your allowed an opinion, I just think your an ass l2benicecausebeinganasswontgetyoufar. Your one of those ‘kids’ that calls me an idiot for calling you an idiot on logical grounds which makes you seem like the idiot rofl.<br>
You have so much to learn, you like 12?</p>
