              <p>Are you trying out for a club team, or are you just playing in a local soccer league thats like 40 bucks for a season?<br>
If you are really into it, soccer is the best sport you could ever play. It uses every muscle in your body, and there is no boring ‘innings’ or 30 minutes of a break between running from second to third base.</p>
<p>I would just recommend sticking it out for a little while longer, and try to get in shape.<br>
You’ll enjoy it a whole lot more.</p>
