    <description>Dear moparscapers,

I&#39;ve been thinking about skills lately. My question was what would players prefer, getting the skills in one certain training spot or spread them across the world? They would only get the normal teleports, varrock tele, lumbridge tele, ... with the correct magic level and runes. I&#39;m really interested in what you guys think about this.

Thanks in advance,

<p>If you had all of the teleport options like in actual rs, then the all over the map thing would not be bad. But you also would need an expansive player base to keep entertainment there.<br>
You are probably not likely to have fairy rings, necklace teleports, Spell-ports, and other forms of legit transportation, (Like minecarts) But if i saw something with all of these working sucessfully in sync, i would be impressed (:</p>
