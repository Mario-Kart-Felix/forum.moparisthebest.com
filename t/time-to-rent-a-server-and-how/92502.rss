    <title>Time to rent a server? And How?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/time-to-rent-a-server-and-how/92502</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve had the feeling that I need to move my server over to another host. At around [b]15-18 people lag[/b] starts to hit everyone. I was wondering wether or not I should search server hosting websites in order to fufill the player needs. There&#39;s a few problems though, I don&#39;t really know what I&#39;m searching for. I&#39;m not sure how I would set something like this up. I&#39;ve never boughten server hosting from a site. I&#39;m hoping someone here has done this before and could help me find a server hosting company that would hold an rs server. I don&#39;t want a private host either. I want a host from a server company. 

The reason I want to do this is that my internet connection is [b]256k[/b] cable. That&#39;s [b]256k upstream[/b] and [b]256k downstream.[/b] [b]*please note the values are in k and not K*[/b] If anyone know how to host a server on a hosting company please tell me. I also [b]can&#39;t upgrade my current internet.[/b] Please help. :(

Thanks,
