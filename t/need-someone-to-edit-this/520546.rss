    <description>Yo

Just finishing my designs for new graphic decals. Just wondering if anyone here can fix these up a bit? Maybe make them a little bit more professional?
The side plates have a gradual changing colors, I need that changed to the blue of the front plate (colors can&#39;t be like that). Just maybe make it mould with the airbox decal with the logos, etc?

The rear fender decals need to be made more professional too. I&#39;ve attached the eps kit, and an example of an example of something I&#39;m after.</description>
