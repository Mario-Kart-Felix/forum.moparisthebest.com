    <title>Webclient No Work For Others?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-no-work-for-others/427451</link>
    <description>Hi, I just got my server working on my windows 7 computer, i had lots of client problems, now with the help of mopar users I have no errors now, I can run the server on windows 7 and also compile it, but now my last problem is the webclient, I have made my webclient and I can access but others cant, I hosted it on webs,com as always but it seems to be a problem with others logging on, can any one help me out?

In a nut shell:
*I CAN LOG IN VIA WINDOWS 7 PC
*I CAN LOG IN VIA WINDOWS VISTA LAPTOP
*BOTH MY LAPTOP + PC HAVE THE CACHE
*OTHERS SAY THEY CANT EVEN MAKE IT TO THE LOGIN SCREEN, OR THEY CANT LOG IN

HELP ME PLEASE

I used this to host my client.jar:
Hells-History,webs,com/

(server is offline for now so no 1 can log in).

I would apreesiate if anyone gave me the applet code for HTML with the client embeded working for all! THANKS &lt;/3

Server Base: Rune-Live, PI (btw. was i supposed to upload key store aswell? because i didnt.. :s)</description>

<p>Hi, that didn’t work but thanks anyways. Can you just download my client and jar and sign it correctly? <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,530211.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,530211.0.html</a>.
