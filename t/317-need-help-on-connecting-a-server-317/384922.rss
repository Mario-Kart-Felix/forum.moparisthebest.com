    <title>[317] Need help on Connecting a server [317]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-need-help-on-connecting-a-server-317/384922</link>
    <description>I have a new 317 client. On this new client... it&#39;s set up correctly but when I put it on Uppit.com (in .rar) it wont work on the other people&#39;s computer. It opens the client but won&#39;t connect to my server... Error connecting to Server. On my other server, people got this error if they were using the Low Detail client, the high detail worked fine... but this server doesn&#39;t have this option for detail. Can anyone help me figure out why it won&#39;t work on other people&#39;s computer, but the new client works fine for me?
P.S. It&#39;s set up for my NO-IP.</description>
