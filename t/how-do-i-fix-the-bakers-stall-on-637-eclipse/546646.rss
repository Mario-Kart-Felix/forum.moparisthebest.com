    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-fix-the-bakers-stall-on-637-eclipse/546646</link>
    <description>Whenever you click it, it just keeps giving you gold, wont stop, i need it to be where you click it, it gives it to you 1 time, waits 5 seconds then gives it to you again, but i cant get it to work at all. I&#39;ve changed the delay between how often it spawns stuff and everything. its a problem in the coding i guess please and thank you</description>
