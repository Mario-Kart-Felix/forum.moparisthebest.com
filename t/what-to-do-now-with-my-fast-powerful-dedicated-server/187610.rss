    <title>What to do now with my fast &amp; powerful Dedicated Server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-to-do-now-with-my-fast-powerful-dedicated-server/187610</link>
    <description>Hey Everyone

I have had a dedicated server (w2k3) for some time now;most will know that.

Today, I got a brand new one fresh off the private host.

I was wondering what peopel think i should do with it.
Should i host a private server? If so, what server i should host that people would like &amp; play?

Specs of server are:
Amd2 Duel core processor 4.02ghz 
8 Gig ram
1.2T Space and unmetered bandwidth on a 1gig per sec line,

Please post thoughts here as i do value what people have to say,
Thanks.
