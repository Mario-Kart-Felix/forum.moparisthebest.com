    <title>Tutorial island help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tutorial-island-help/539339</link>
    <description>So I downloaded a source and after you finish talking to the RuneScape Guide, the npc that you first meet in Tutorial Island, the arrow goes over toward the door and tells you to click on it and proceed to your next instructor. I click on the door and the arrow goes over to the instructor and then goes back to the door and doesn&#39;t allow you to proceed. The arrow stays on the door.

How can I fix this so the arrow will move on to over the next guides head without the arrow going back to over the door? If that makes sense.... lol. 

I&#39;ve attatched a picture below. As you can see, I&#39;ve already clicked on the door and went through it, so the arrow should now be over the instructors head. How can I fix this?
