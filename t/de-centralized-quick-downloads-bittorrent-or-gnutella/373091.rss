    <title>De-centralized quick downloads (BitTorrent or gnutella?)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/de-centralized-quick-downloads-bittorrent-or-gnutella/373091</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to figure out a better way to distribute semi-large (16-100mb) files to a large number of people running a java program than HTTP downloads that are bandwidth heavy and hammer the server.  I haven&#39;t found a recent [url=http://www.threerings.net/code/snark/]java torrent implementation[/url], so I was thinking about writing a wrapper for [url=http://www.rasterbar.com/products/libtorrent/]libtorrent[/url], and I found that frostwire actually already has such a wrapper, I&#39;m currently downloading the frostwire source which is massive.  But that got me thinking about gnutella, it&#39;s in frostwire too and potentially another good candidate.

Do any of you have experience with either of the above, from a programming point of view?  Or do you know any nice, easy, recent pure-java implementations of either protocol?  Or do you have a better alternative?  Thanks.</description>

              <p>Can someone test a command line windows binary for me?  I’ve attached it to this post, see if it runs, it should display the ‘help’ dialog at the very least, and if you could test it to see if it will start downloading a magnet link for you I’d appreciate it.</p>
<p>I really don’t know what’s going on, because it seems to run just fine under Linux using WINE, but when I run it on Windows (XP and 7) it doesn’t seem to do anything, no errors, no output.  I don’t know quite what is going on.  I cross compiled it myself under Linux using mingw32.</p>

              <p>I still haven’t found a GOOD way to handle this, but I think what I might do is compile a transmission-cli binary for all the targets (32-bit windows and linux, and ppc and intel OSX), and then invoke the process from java and parse the output.  It’s nasty, but not more nasty than using JNI, which would require a 32-bit and 64-bit shared library for windows and linux, and one each for OSX as well, uck.</p>
<p>I’d love other and/or better ideas from anyone, please.</p>

</aside>
<p>I actually found both of these yesterday, phex does look quite good and it might work for what I need, but it looks closely tied to the GUI and I’m not sure how easy ripping out the bare minimum would be.  snark looks like it could have been good last time it was updated back in 2003, but now it is missing so many needed things like DHT, encryption, magnet links, HTTP seeding, etc etc that it is near useless as a torrent client.  If I used snark I would have to rely on a central tracker staying up for it to work, but if I use a recent client I don’t.</p>
