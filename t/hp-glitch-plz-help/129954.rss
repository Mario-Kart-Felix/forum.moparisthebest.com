    <description>The problem is when anyone logs into their account their hits go down to 10/135 Even if they heal and get them to 50 log out and back in and its back down to 10
EX: If i die i get 135/135 then some1 attacks me and hits a 15 its down to 120. But then i log out and back into the server and bam it 10/135
and then someone hits me a 10 and im dead
