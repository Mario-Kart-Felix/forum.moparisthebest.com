    <title>Connection filter (no one helped so ill reword it)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connection-filter-no-one-helped-so-ill-reword-it/336796</link>
    <description>Alright I added a connection filter to my server. I changed the code partially so it would only allow one connection per player, but if you double log it temporarily bans you. If I double log it says temporarily banning player when I try to log in to the second account. When i log out of the first account and try to log in again im still temporarily banned until i restart the server. What I want to do is make it so it doesn&#39;t temporarily ban you. So it still will only be 1 connection per ip but you won&#39;t get temporarily banned. This will still fix syipkpker, but you wont get temporarily banned.
Heres the link for the tut I followed:

If I didn&#39;t make myself clear enough tell me please.
Thanks</description>

<p>I think your failing to understand that when more than one connection from the same host IP address connects it bans them, that is exactly how it blocks the Syipkpkers becase the attack is from one IP. Removing that would defeat the purpose of having the connection filter. I told you to raise the number allowed and I told you how to do it. Why you decided to post another topic I don’t know.</p>

<p>Your clearly not understanding.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">I don’t want it to temporarily ban them.</span> I want it to only allow one connection per ip because if people double log they will get temp ban and they cant log in until i restart the server. I can loose alot of players like that. I dont want to raise the player allowation or w/e because if they log fast then it will still temp ban them. It will just be alot easier if you can answer my question.</p>
