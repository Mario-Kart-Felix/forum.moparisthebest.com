    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-there-any-way-to/149315</link>
    <description>Is there any way that I can make a portal have a certain text above it?  I know I can put npc&#39;s in front of it and have them saying what it is, but is there a way to put a code with the portal making it float above it or talk like an npc?

If so could u give me an example or explain with detail how I could do this?  Thx.</description>
