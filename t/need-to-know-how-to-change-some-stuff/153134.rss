    <description>I am currently using the source P16.

I cant find out where in Client.Java to make other people admins, mods, ect.

Need to know how to make the command fly for mods and up only and where to create it and where to put it, mines not working.

How to create commands period lol.

How to put in the health for NPC&#39;s.

How to edit Npc&#39;s max hit&#39;s 

How to make it so Npc&#39;s talk to you and you have a choice of saying nvm or talking to him/her and accepting a quest or something ect.

How to put the trade window for Npc&#39;s so you can browse their shop and how to put items in there.

                                THIS would be a big help if someone could answer all of these or at least some of them.</description>
