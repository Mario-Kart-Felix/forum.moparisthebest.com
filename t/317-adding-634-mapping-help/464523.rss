    <title>[317] Adding 634 mapping HELP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-adding-634-mapping-help/464523</link>
    <description>Will someone help please? I did everything right, gzipped all my .dat files, cache is fine. When i log in on my client it shows where im at all black and then half the map i can see, and then it freezes me. I think it may have to do with somthing in my client.java or OnDemandFetcher, the way i added the codes in, but i fixed the coding in OnDemandFetcher from streamloader to archive and it fixed my errors i had before.

Using Lost Valentino&#39;s adding 634 maps tutorial

Someone please help?
Greatly appreciated.</description>
