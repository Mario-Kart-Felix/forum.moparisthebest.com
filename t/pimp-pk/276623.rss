    <description>Well me and Martyn (Vegeta) were planning on opening a Pimpscape themed PK/Combat server based on emulous. We made the server and then both decided we didn&#39;t have enough time for this, so I just thought I&#39;d release for anyone else that wanted it.

Features:

[ul][*]Whole of varrock is pking with no level restrictions (East and west bank are safe zones as well as the training area.
[*]Perfect dummy training for weaponless training, trains the combat skill dependant upon your attack style.
[*]Barrows.
[*]Full slayer assignments.
[*]Shops done.
[*]Perfect teleporting.
[*]Jad
[*]Thieving is the only non-combat skill as it is used upstairs in varrock east bank to thief money from chests.
[*]Mage Arena pking.
[*]Duel arena
[*]Perfect magic, range and melee.
[*]Perfect prayer.
[*]Perfect skulling, item losses etc...
[*]Almost perfect duel arena with a lot of bugs fixed.
[*]NPC training and dummy training.[/ul]


Basically we tried to make this server as &quot;pimpscape&quot; themed without reverting back to clicking a door for strength as we may as well have just used pimpscape then. You can add anything you want, all non-combat related skills (except thieving) are currently set to 99 by default as we have tried to make this server as combat related as possible, you can add any of them if you wish to do so.

The server did have a few things that needed doing such as a method of changing spellbooks and a prayer alter loaded to recharge prayer on. You can do them all yourselves.

I can&#39;t be bothered to post pictures as normal.

CLIENT: The client is just a modified deltascape as it had the headicons working perfectly we have fixed some bugs with it but you can do what you want with it as I did not actually edit it much other then the odd bug fixes.
