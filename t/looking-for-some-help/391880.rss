    <title>Looking for some help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-some-help/391880</link>
    <description>I am wanting to run a server, and I had before for about 4 months. My JavaScript guru graduated from college and got a demanding job, quit on me, and left some things half updated. I can do some intermediate Java, I have taken introductory college courses, but I need someone who really understands the coding in-depth, and has the time to do it.

When I and 2 others were running my server, I did some very unique things to advertise and monetize the server, 90% of which I have never seen replicated on another server. I am a mature person, I am 100% up for the idea of 2-3 co-owners with an equal share of responsibility, ownership, and opinion. 

I really do think that we can make something great here. I learned a lot while advertising the server we had before, and I&#39;ve already made some of the rookie mistakes. I have played RSPS since 2006-ish, and I know what players want because I am one of them. 

I have some great ideas, and have no issue with discussing them with you. I have more recently ran a few blogs and content-pulling(turn-key) websites, and I am a bit bored with that work. 

If anyone who is an *Advanced* JavaScript user would be interested in working with me, I am able to invest a lot of time in creating a project unparalleled to any other. 

Send me a message or post here. I&#39;ll be keeping an eye out for responses.
