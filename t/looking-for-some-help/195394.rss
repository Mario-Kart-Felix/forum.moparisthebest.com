    <title>Looking for some help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-some-help/195394</link>
    <description>Hey. I&#39;m Tawr.

I was hoping someone out there could give me some help on some coding i&#39;m hoping to do. I&#39;ve only really done some really slight stuff and can&#39;t really do much.

So if someone out there could gimme a hand, like a tutor or something that would be greatly aprreciated. Ofcource if i ever release this source or as a server 99.9% of the credits go to you lol  :D. I&#39;ve got some small knowledge of coding but i hope to learn more.

So please post if your up for it!
thanks
