    <title>Looking for some help</title>

    <description>Hello, I&#39;m Miles. I&#39;m looking for someone who is fluent in Java and computer basics who wants to help me create an RS2 Server. I&#39;m slowly learning on my own when I have the free time, I&#39;m more into the RSC Scene but it seems RS2 is a huge industry.

If you are willing to help me / work with me, just add my msn; watkins-@live.com or PM me.
Thanks.

If this isn&#39;t allowed or is in the wrong place just delete it.</description>
