    <title>Projectile problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/projectile-problem/397651</link>
    <description>So i got this problem with projectiles, lets say i cast fire wave on a person who was walking, when i cast it and click on him he somehow teleports/glitches(instead of walking like normal and getting hit) to where he was headed then the projectile hits him. 

any help or points in the right directions would be much appreciated :D


Fixed :D</description>
