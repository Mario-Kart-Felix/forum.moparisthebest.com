    <description>[b]And THIS Happens:[/b]

[IMG]http://i30.tinypic.com/mrxwkk.jpg[/img]

[b]I dare ask, wtf? All I RECENTLY did, was change a command, add some items in item.cfg and item4.java so they&#39;re coded in right, and maybe changed a description of an item in Class8.java.

Accursed errors, always in the way of my work.

Note: 317 server; Czar base; Don&#39;t flame for left; Only happens when I try to log into server.[/b][br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 13, 2009, 08:23:07 pm[/size][hr]Absolutely nevermind. This was the most dumb-ass error I&#39;ve ever seen.
And it was fixed.

It was over the CENSOR... Appearently you can&#39;t have * as a &quot;badword&quot;, so it gives you that shit&#39;d-up error.

--Fixed, feel free to lock.

I Lol&#39;d when I fixed it XP</description>
