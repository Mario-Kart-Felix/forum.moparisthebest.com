[size=14pt][u][b]About us[/b][/u][/size]

Ethereal PvP is a 317 Runescape Private Server loading Oldschool Runescape Data started in early May.
We strives to perfect the criteria that all Eco-PvP players enjoy.
Ethereal PvP is constantly being updated to optimize our players experience.

We know not everyone has money to spend online
so we have decided that we will also be accepting OSRS gold as a lot of you play it.
1M OSRS = $1 USD
And better yet? you can VOTE for credits to spend in the members stores!


Do you have a Suggestion for something you&#39;d like added to the server?
We are driven by player Suggestions and will try our best to add as many ideas as we can.
