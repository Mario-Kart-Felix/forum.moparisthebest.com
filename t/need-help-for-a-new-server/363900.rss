    <description>Hello ya&#39;ll.. well i played a server and it has gone all crazy, so i decided to make my own server... 
but tho, i don&#39;t know how to code, not even basics :s but i would really like to learn java-codeing, so what i really want is someone who is willing to code my server for me :D it would really be awsome if sumbody would help codeing my server, ofc with the status of Co&#39;s i will be glad to take in more then one ...
I really want to make a great server where the people who plays it has somthing to say...
