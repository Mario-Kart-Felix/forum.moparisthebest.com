    <title>[508] Error connecting to server [508]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-error-connecting-to-server-508/448882</link>
    <description>I just recently switched from 317 to 508 and now I&#39;m having trouble getting people to log into my server, I port forwarded and set up a no-ip and it all works fine. 

When my friend tries to log into my server (via my client that I sent him, that has the ip set up correctly, I think) it loads up perfectly fine to the login screen, but when he trys to log in it says error connecting to server.
But I can log in perfectly fine and the source cmd says that I connected using the local Ip. (127.0.0.1)
Also, whenever he does try to log in I get a message in my source cmd saying &quot;Recieved connection from: *his IP*&quot; but still he cannot log in.

If anyone could help or atleast try to help it would be highly appreciated :(</description>
