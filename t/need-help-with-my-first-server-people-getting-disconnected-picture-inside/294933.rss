    <title>Need help with my first server,people getting disconnected , picture inside</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-my-first-server-people-getting-disconnected-picture-inside/294933</link>
    <description>Hi , I started my first server last night. I did it becouse a kid asked me on msn and I thought &quot;why not&quot; , I could use the experience. So I read the &quot;how to start a server&quot; and I used the moparscape client as &quot;source&quot;. I forwarded all the necessary ports ( router and firewall) but when people try to log into my server they get stuck at the &quot;loading&quot; phase, on my end I see them logging in and I see their chars ingame but then they get disconnected. I&#39;ve included a picture of the consol on my end so you can see the info im getting: http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/2931/timedout.png

The highlighted areas are the ones I think are important , and my question is now , how do I keep them from getting timed out? I can host games on other games like on Battle.net and counter-strike, so I dunno what the problem is , please help.

Thank you for your time.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 13, 2009, 10:20:42 am[/size][hr]bump, edited the topic a little so more people understand the problem.</description>
