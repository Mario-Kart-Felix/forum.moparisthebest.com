    <title>iPod Touch vs. ArchOS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ipod-touch-vs-archos/415491</link>
    <description>Payday is tomorrow, and I&#39;m considering buying something nice for myself. I have been doing research for a few weeks now, and have not been able to make a definitive decision.

What I&#39;m looking for is essentially a device that can play different forms of media, is handheld, has a touch screen, and has an &quot;app market&quot; of sorts. At first I was considering an iPhone, but came to the conclusion that I don&#39;t need the phone capabilities. Then I considered getting an Android device (no restrictions on apps, don&#39;t need to pay $99 for the DevKit). The only ones I could find where the HTC phones, Droid phones, etc. but when asked if I could buy the phone without the contract, the sales associates said that they couldn&#39;t contractually do it (perhaps they were lying just to get some more money out of me).

I was then told about the ArchOS devices, and it seemed to be exactly what I wanted. I found the ArchOS 4.3, and it seemed to be the closest thing to an iPod Touch. Next came the comparisons.

They both share an ARM Cortex-A8 processor which is clocked at 1GHz. However, Many sources have stated the the iPod is underclocked to 800MHz.

Battery life is pretty close; The iPod reportedly has 4 more hours of audio playback, but 3 less hours of video playback, compared to the ArchOS (not sure how that&#39;s really possible though).

The iPod is slightly smaller at 4.4 x 2.3 x 0.28 in, compared to the ArchOS 5.3 x 2.6 x 0.4 in. The iPod weighs just under 1 gram less.

I couldn&#39;t accurately compare charge times, due to them not being specified on the ArchOS website; but the iPod is about 4 hours.

The iPod has a 3.5in screen, versus the ArchOS 4.3. The iPod however has a higher resolution, at 960x640 with 326 PPI, compare to the ArchOS 854x480 at ~227 PPI. The iPod also has a multi-touch display (ArchOS site doesn&#39;t say, so I&#39;ll assume it doesn&#39;t).

Video recording I believe to be similar (can&#39;t be certain due to tech specs. not specified by apple)

iPod can come in 8GB, 32GB, or 64GB sizes, with no external storage ability. The ArchOS comes in either 8GB or 16GB, but has a MicroSD slot.

You have the ability to replace the OS on the ArchOS with another Linux distro, or even dualboot.

What are your opinions about each, and what are some other points of interest that I might not have considered. Also if anyone has, currently or previously, owned an ArchOS device, please tell me of your experience with it.</description>

<p>As far as your decision, it sounds like you want something you can customize (you mentioned a dev-kit), so you absolutely do not want the iPod.

<p>I didn’t hear that about ArchOS. I just understood it as a company that sells devices that use the Android OS.</p>
<p>Yes, I’m aware that Android is essentially a Linux distribution, and thus I can edit every bit of code that I want. Do you know of any other retailers that sell an Android device? Maybe if I used the term “internet-device” I might be able to bring up a few more relevant hits.</p>
