    <title>A little help adding customs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-little-help-adding-customs/337574</link>
    <description>Ok well, I have done a decent bit, the only things I need help with now is &gt; if it has a special how would i add it(idk if it comes with one) and how do I add the animation for it?
Ok so far I have : 
-Added into models(client sided)
-Added into Class8.java(Client sided)
-Went into game and put &quot;add model (number)
-Given the weapon to myself.
-Edited weapon stats(server sided)
So far it is all workin out great, it has its name and all, stats, etc. However when I go to hit, I want it to have the animation of a whip, as its a dragon whip. Instead the weapon disappears for the attack, the character holds their right hand back and then swings forward doin damage. How can I fix this?
(also if you know, reply to adding special attacks)
(and of course yes, I have compiled everything..)
Thanks :D</description>
