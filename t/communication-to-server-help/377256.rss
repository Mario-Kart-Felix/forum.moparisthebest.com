    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/communication-to-server-help/377256</link>
    <description>I am wanting to do something new. my question is what are the minimum methods to communicate with a server? methods to build, read, and right packets; and etc. but im sure there are more than what i mentioned. if i dont get help here. then ill just look at the source code of a program that isnt the rs client but can still connects and communicates with the servers.

thx in advanced</description>
