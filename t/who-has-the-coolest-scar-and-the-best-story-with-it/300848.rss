    <title>Who has the coolest scar and the best story with it?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/who-has-the-coolest-scar-and-the-best-story-with-it/300848</link>
    <description>Title says it all. Let&#39;s see who has the coolest scar (look wise) and who has the best story behind it. I&#39;ll start. 

My coolest lookin scar is a 5 inch one on my chest. I had an inverted sternum (medically known as Pectus Excavatum), and had surgery a few years ago where they put a bar in my chest, and then popped out the &quot;dent&quot;. I had the Bar in for a year, and was incapable of walking for 3 months after the surgery. It&#39;s funny though because when people at the pool ask me about it I tell them when I was little I was watching TV with my drunk dad and I changed the channel to Teletubbies and then he knifed me, took the remote and said &quot;Sports center bitch&quot;. Rofl. 

My other good one is when I was in 4th grade playing soccer on our elementary school&#39;s playground and somebody kicked the ball over the nearby fence, so I volunteered to hop it and grab the ball. While I was jumpin over I snagged my ass cheek on a nail sticking up and it ripped like a 4 inch scar down my right cheek haha. I ended up getting stitches. But the best part is later that night I was showering and you know those soap holders that stick out of the wall? Well ours was broken at the time so there was a jagged edge sticking out and I turned funny when I slipped a little and cut my other butt cheek and had to get stitches for that haha. 



oh yeah and winner gets a cookie</description>

              <p>Preschool can fuck you up. 2 5th graders were playing tag while I was walking in front of them. One of them came by and passed me but the other one pushed me. I fell back and slammed my head on a cinder block.<br>
My screams were so loud my mom (who was working there) and the principal  heard them from in the school. They took me to the hospital. I had about 5 staples. After 3 weeks, my mom had to take the staples out her self. OUCH! Now I have a giant line the doesnt have any hair.</p>

<p>Anyways, I got a bullet wound on my side from getting shot from a couple of gangbangers after I threw their sign down because I was a rival of theirs n when they were reaching in their pockets I made a run for it. I was all of a sudden in alot of pain realizin I was shot and i fell n smacked my face hard on the concrete. Luckily, there were witnesses around and when I went down, they ran from being scared while the cops got them and were charged with attempted murder and other various charges. I was in the hospital for a week due to internal bleeding causing a bad loss of blood and infection to my intestine spreading. Was very close at hitting my spine that would of paralyzed me for my life. From then on, I stopped gangbanging yet still continue to represent my own blood.</p>

              <p>When I was about 5, me and my sister were playing on a trailer in my garage, climbing up and down. When I was climbing up I used the back light as like a step, when I put the pressure down on the light it fell off and my leg slit open on a wire sticking out. When I was 9 on the same trailer, I was at the top and the lights were out in my garage. I jumped down and felt the same wire slice open my leg. They turned the lights on and I looked down at it and thought “It’s not so bad” Then the blood started poring out of it. To this day I have 2 huge scars on the front and back of my left leg.</p>

<p>[quote=“maniown, post:1, topic:301725”]Well guys, the next few weeks of my life are going to suck. I had my entire weekend planned out. Football game and party tonight, and go to my friends lake house for the weekend. Not anymore.<br>
So pretty much what happened is i was racing my friend on our dirtbikes and i took a corner to fast, i went through a barbwire fence and nearly decapitated myself. I just got out of the emergency room after being in there for a good 4 hours.<br>
Long story short, i was 1.5 millimeters from killing myself. [/quote]<br>

              <p>I have a scar on my left wrist. I got it while camping with my family last summer. We were cooking hot dogs around the campfire with these: <img src="http://www.vankams.com/images/rv/hotdog_stick.gif" alt width="" height=""> And all was good. My bro, a complete retard and clumsy baboon, was taking his hot dog off and when he was done put it down right next to me. Note: The metal part is red hot.  Now i reach down to get my drink… and miss. But guess what I did get? The metal part of the stick. I had a mark like a “U” for about 2 days, then all but one side (like a “/”) remained. Its been over a year. Its not exactly a “scar” but its a darker spot on my skin, like a permanent burn.</p>
