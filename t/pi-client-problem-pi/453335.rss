    <description>Hello guys, I&#39;m trying to add object models in my server so that the stairs and some other things in castle wars aren&#39;t armor and capes, whenever I add the models into my Raw folder, it doesn&#39;t update them, I know they work because whenever I make my client read an entire different cache using those models, it works for the models but some other objects/items are messed up or nulled, so can anybody please help me out?</description>
