    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/opinions-inputs-what-you-want-to-see/551175</link>
    <description>Just curious as to what people want, enjoy and keep players sticking to a rsps? Before it was spawns and fast money/xp and about pking. What uniqueness do you want to see these day?

Just gathering ideas.

My Likings is a server that has cool minigames and has features to make you feel like you&#39;ve gained something.

What&#39;s the idea of servers these days?</description>

I like servers which is not some pre-eoc garbage. In all honesty, I don’t understand why so many people are creating 718 servers etc. That was the time when RuneScape was just complete trash. Everyone who played back in the day knows that RuneScape was at its best during the 2007 era. 474 onwards was a decline. Hence why more people play OSRS than RS3. I personally will never play a server 474 onwards. And no, I refuse to play a 317 loading higher revision graphic too…[/quote]<br>
That’s because it was far more balanced. There weren’t melee weapons that could plow over someone in 2 special attacks. You had the tools for pretty much any situation, it was up to you how you used them. Then it got to the point where if you didn’t invest months into dungeoneering to get a rapier and 95 prayer then you might as well not even try.<br>
That’s not just player killing either, that includes bosses. Trying to fight over Bandos with someone with a divine, rapier, bandos, soulsplit and a pack-yak whilst using a whip was just pissing in the wind.</p>
