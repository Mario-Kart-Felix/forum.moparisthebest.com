    <description>The tutorial is describing:

Port forwarding.



The purpose for this tutorial:

Port forwarding is used to let other people connect to a certain port on your computer, allowing them to for example join you on your RuneScape (Classic) private server, or other games and programs.



The steps for fully completing this tutorial:

1. First you need to know the standard IP address of your router.

2. Then, when you know this, change your IP address, which at the moment usually is a dynamic IP address, to your routers standard IP address with the last number as a number of your choice.

Here is an example:
Your router uses the IP address: 192.168.2.1
What you should change your IP address to in this case is: 192.168.2.X - Where X is any number between 2 and 255.

3. Set your Netmask to: 255.255.255.0.

4. Set your standard Gateway to: 192.168.2.1 - This should be your routers standard IP address.

5. Set your standard DNS to: 192.168.2.1 - This should be your routers standard IP address.

6. When you have done all this, open your browser, and type in your routers standard IP address (192.168.2.1 in the example) in your address field, and click on &quot;ENTER&quot;.

7. Now you should be in your routers configuration page. There usually is a log in box, where standard does not have a password. You do best in adding a password, if you already havn&#39;t. When logged in, there is two choices (atleast in my router), which are &quot;Advanced Setup&quot; or &quot;Setup Wizard&quot;. Choose the advanced one, because it is here you can do the port forwarding.

8. In my router there is a place called &quot;NAT&quot;. When you clicked on it, and you have chosen &quot;Virtual Server&quot;, a few boxes will appear. All routers might not be the same as my router, so you&#39;d better search for a place where you can add private IPs, private and public ports and TCP/UDP type.

9. Now you just have to fill out the forms with your information. Write your IP address in the IP address field, and write the port (standard for RS and RSC private servers are 43594) in both the private and the public port fields, if both exists. Use TCP in the TCP/UDP option.

10. Now it is just to save your settings, either with &quot;Apply&quot; or any other equivalent button.



It is hard to cover all of the different routers ways of port forwarding, but I tried my best to do it with only explaining how my router works. If you got problems with your router, please visit the site: http://www.portforwarding.com/

And remember that you need to know the manufacturer and the model of your router to get the most out of it.

Somebody might be interrested in what router I use, so here it is: SMC 7004VBR
