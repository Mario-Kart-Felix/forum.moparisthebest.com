    <title>Rsc?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsc/229193</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;ve searched and googled and searched some more...
and well i really havent found anything about rsc anymore
like i remember whne i used to play that there were soooo many rsc scripts
but like now, where are they?
i had some but then i formatted my pc and they were lost
but someone must have one, no?
Well this is just a request for old scripts that would work on the private servers running around now...

i&#39;ve still got some scripts if anyone is interested
theya re powerminers
pwoerfishers
and crappy  autofighters

most of the ones i have dont work very well
but if anyone wants it i can upload them to a rar file...

also
if anyone knows of a bot for like rsca or something
like the ausbot
but ausbot is payed so i cant really get it &quot;/
but anyways
if you do have anything
pelase post here =)

thanks everyone for reading this...

and dont flame me please &gt;.&lt;</description>

              <p>your asking for a good, free bot.</p>
<p>The chances of finding one for free thats good and works are slim to none.</p>
<p>As for a script request… you gotta be a bit more specific than ‘old scripts’</p>
