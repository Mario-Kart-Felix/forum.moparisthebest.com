    <description>Hey there, as my account has 25 days left of Rsc membership i was wondering if anyone knows any bugs or fun things you can do on it? Now as it &quot;Never&quot; gets updated some of these may work, however last night i did see a guy stuck in a coal rock (probably new punishment method for auto&#39;s lol) Yes i&#39;m mighty bored but i was just wondering, there must be a few things =)

Also, looking through the sections, i believe this is the right one, oh and i don&#39;t care if i get banned from Rsc, ill test/try anything you suggest.</description>
