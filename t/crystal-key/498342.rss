    <description>So i recently made a crystal key chest i tested it by spawning a crystal key (989) and used it on the chest and it worked with no errors. I added crystal keys to drops and used my p ring and killed the npc i added it too for 30 minutes i then got sick of waiting so i made it so a random can drop it with no other drops so in npcdrops.tsm it looks like
[code]#test
931:100	989:1[/code]
If you can help me get crystal key to drop that&#39;d be great.
