    <description>DryBasic Include
1.0.0a by Can

If you read my post about &quot;Hold Mouse Detection Talk&quot; you know already why I made this include file, that I named &quot;DryBasic&quot;. It is simply used when you want to use some safe and fast BASIC functions, but you dont want to load the whole srl include. And you are too lazy to code the functions in your scripts yourself.

The include file includes the following commands.

DryType(text: String);
Types in keystrokes in a human like maner. Altho basic, it is undetectable.

DryTypeSubmit(text: String);
Types in keystrokes in a human like maner. Altho basic, it is undetectable. When it is done typing in the message, it submits the string. (Pushes enter).

DryClick(dcdc: Boolean);
Improved undetectable mouse click. use, DryClick(true); for left click, and DryClick(false); for right click.

DryDoubleClick;
Makes a undetectable doubleClick. Use this rather than using &quot;DryClick&quot; twice, as drydoubleclick is made undetectable. when calling dryclick twice in a row might get detected because of the lack in wait(x); that is added to drydoubleclick.


Place the file in your INCLUDES folder. When making scripts with theese functions remember to &quot;include the include&quot; first with this code of line:
{.include drybasic.txt}

PS. I would love feedback, and if you actualy make a script using dryBasic please give me a note ;)

Enjoy, love

<p>I will start with answering the top of your post <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
It may seem like it is the same thing, but it is not, one submits the info, and the other one dont.</p>
<p>I quote a line from the submit function:<br>
drytext:= drytext + chr(13);</p>
<p>You dont find that line in drytype. So they are not the exact same.</p>
<p>Anyways, you are offcourse perfectly right when it comes to the fact that i can make the function with true/false so i get both the functions in the same package. This will certantly be made for the next version. Thanks <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>If you read the entier topic on “Hold mouse detection talk” you would found out that, yes. What you say is true. That thing is found in function “Mouse”. However, many of the other srl functions such as “Cmouse” (Cmouse is the main clicking procedure, as Mouse move the mouse to x location first) etc dont use it.</p>
<p>Hope this clearify some of your concern. I must also say once more that this include is NOT made as an option to srl. It is simply an alternative when you need BASIC commands for your script, but you dont want to include the heavy srl include. It does prove some uniqness anyways.</p>
<p>Love<br>

<p>Ps, thanks once more for the feedback and support![/quote]</p>
<p>Ah alright. Perhaps you could add some procedures like:<br>
-A smooth mouse(Just use MoveMouseSmoothEx)</p>
<p>And yea. It looks alright,<br>
