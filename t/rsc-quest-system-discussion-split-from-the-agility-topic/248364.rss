              <p>I already tried to document little bit of quests in RSC earlier. I got almost the whole Romeo and Juliet quest done… I am lacking the part when you start talking to Juliet. But I think I got the whole part of when you start talking to Romeo. I went out of RSC-accounts to be able to document the part of Juliet. I have 3 RSC accounts.</p>
<p>So here is the quest (even spelling-mistakes are included as in RSC):</p>
<blockquote>Options 1 [MENU M]:
 Yes, I have seen her
 No, but that's girls for you
 Can I help find her for you?
<p>Options 2 [MENU M.1]:<br>
Yes, I will tell her<br>
Sorry, I am too busy. Maybe later?</p>
<p>Options 3 [MENU M.2]:<br>
Yes, I will tell her how you feel<br>
I can’t, it sounds like work to me</p>

<span class="hashtag">#5:</span> Can I help find her for you? -&gt; START_QUEST</p>
<p>START:</p>
<p>Romeo: Juliet, juliet, juliet! Wherefore are thou?<br>
Romeo: Kind friend, have you seen juliet?<br>
Romeo: Her and her father seem to have disappeared</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#1</span> - [Yes, I have seen her] :: [Yes, I will tell her]:</p>
<p>You: Yes, i have seen her<br>
You: I think it was her. Blond, stressed<br>

Romeo: Please tell her i long to be with her</p>
<p>[OPTION 1 : Yes, I will tell her]</p>
<p>You: Yes, i will tell her how you feel<br>

Romeo: Could you find her for me?<br>
Romeo: Please tell her i long to be with her</p>

Apothecary: Wing of rat, tail of from. Ear of snake and horn of dog<br>
Apothecary: I have all that, but i need some cadavaberries<br>
Apothecary: You will have to find them while i get the rest ready<br>
Apothecary: Bring them here when you have them. But be careful. They are nasty</p>

              <p>ok if you want to recreate RSC completly, case by case wouldn’t be a problem…<br>

<p>would you say then lothy that what people are doing right now for quests ( checks per npc with questststatus ) is a good way of handling this?</p>
