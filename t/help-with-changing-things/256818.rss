    <description>Ok, I used the RageScape 317 Source and in the emote list there are the teleports I want to change all of those back to emote but im not sure what I need to write for this to work if someone knows please reply to me.

Reason for changing back &quot;I made all the teleports into portals&quot;

This is what it says right now
[code]

            case 168:
                if (teleblock == true) { // Made by FusionLord
                    sendMessage(&quot;A magical force stops you from teleporting.&quot;); 
                } else {
                    customCommand(&quot;home&quot;); // made by FusionLord
                }
                break;
