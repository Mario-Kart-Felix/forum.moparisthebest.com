        <p>I was talking to a couple of people in the IRC earlier and one of them who is a mod brought up a very good point that I believe none of us really realize. When we make reports for “viruses, wrong sections and etc” We aren’t being specific. The staff here have a variety of skills in different languages/traits. However, they do not know everything.</p>
<p>I am guilty just as much as the next person for just putting “wrong section, virus and etc.”</p>
<p>Because the moderators do not know where certain topics need to be moved at they can spend priceless minutes trying to find a more appropriate section. I was informed that there is a topic in the staff area to help navigate however it doesn’t help as much as they wish. (I guess?)</p>
<p>As far as suggestions I was thinking maybe like a red message(sort of like when you about to post on a topic that has new replies) and it will say pleas be specific on the comments.</p>
<p>Ruby and I discussed possible other features like adding more boxes for members to fill out, but we both agreed that we didn’t see that as being a liable solution.</p>
<p>I would like to get some more feedback on ways we can help assist the staff/moderators with this current issue.</p>
<p>The only other idea that really came to mind was to have experienced sectionals for specific sections. ( For example somebody who actually has programmed/developed rsps recently to  be the moderator for that particular area.)</p>

        <p>It’s really not that bad… if a mod doesn’t see how a thread breaks the rules right off the bat (you can see the reported topic/post in the moderator window), they can check the comment. If the comment makes it more clear, they can take action. If it still doesn’t look like it breaks the rules, they can just close the report. Doesn’t really take much time at all, except in some extreme cases where you need to research backstory or remove tons of posts. (I once spent two hours cleaning a thread, reading every reply)</p>

<p>The topic is really referring to wrong section stuff mostly lol. Like for instance you know how these noobs post client related questions in server help? Yeah, Ruby has even said it can take him a  while to figure out if a certain topic goes in client help/client hacking/whatever.</p>

<p>I don’t mind the new report system at all, it has its advantages and disadvantages for me. However an easier solution to this is perhaps to adopt the old report system (all reports had their own topic created in a section with a quote of the reported post and the reason why it was reported). It was an easy system, but yet again, it’s probably not necessary since our current report center is fine.</p>
