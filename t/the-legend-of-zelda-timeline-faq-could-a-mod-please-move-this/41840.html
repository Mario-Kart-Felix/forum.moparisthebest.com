<p>Unfortunately, this has to be the first section because, as the last version showed, some people will miss it.</p>
<p>Now that I don’t have to worry about single vs. double timeline flamewars (you’ll find out why in section 4) this section can be a lot smaller.  Just the usual rules: no flaming, no trolling, no spamming, and all that other good stuff.  Please follow this rule, however.  Try not to bash someone’s theory too badly if you don’t agree with it.  Just politely correct them, or argue about it in a semi-civilized manner.  I realize this rule probably won’t be followed, but I thought I’d put it in here anyway.</p>
<p>Also, IT IS UNNECESSARY TO BUMP A STICKIED TOPIC!  Three of the last four posts in the board guide have been bumps, even after I informed the guys who did it originally that it was unnecessary.  Just be warned, bumping a stickied topic can be considered disruptive posting.  I won’t mark you for it, but others may, so please, don’t bump this topic after it’s stickied.</p>

<li>
<p>There IS a timeline.  You’d think this would be obvious, but apparently it’s not.  So for anyone who says there isn’t one, go to <a href="http://www.gannon-banned.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.gannon-banned.com</a>, look at number 16, and read the articles in the links provided.  Then tell me there’s not a timeline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are multiple Links, 9 known ones to be exact.  They are, in release date order, not timeline order, like this:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>1.LoZ and AoL Link (Nintendo and the manual of AoL have said so.)</p>
<p>2.ALttP and LA Link (The LA manual says so.)</p>
<p>3.OoT and MM Link (It says so in MM.)</p>
<p>4.OoA and OoS (No explanation needed.)</p>
<p>5.FS</p>
<p>6.TWW</p>
<p>7.FSA</p>
<p>8.TMC</p>
<p>9.TP</p>
<p>That’s all of them so far.  Now, one common misconception is that all the Links in the FS trilogy are the same person.  That is not true, because in the beginning of both FS and FSA, Zelda explains to Link who Vaati is, and also tells him the Legend of the Four Sword.  You’d think if he used the Four Sword to defeat Vaati in TMC, and then again in FS, he would remember Vaati, and what the Four Sword is.  Also, the Links in those three games look like they’re about the same age.  In both FS and FSA, the events of the previous games in the trilogy are referred to as legends.  Things don’t become legends overnight.  If Link was the same guy in all of those three games, tales of his exploits would have to have been passed down from generation to generation in roughly a few months.  As far as I know, that’s not possible.  The only explanation is that all three of them are different Links.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Like it or not, the FS trilogy and the Oracle games are part of the timeline.  True, they were made by Capcom, but they were overseen by Nintendo. Also, in TSA’s recent interview with Eiji Aonuma, Mr. Aonuma said that the Four Sword series is very important to the overall Zelda timeline. The only Zelda games not part of the timeline are the three Phillips CDi games: Zelda’s Adventure; Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon; and Link: Faces of Evil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hylian, Hylians, Hyrulean, Hyruleans, Hyrulian, and Hyrulians.  These words are confused quite a bit when it comes to this series.  As of right now, Hylian, Hylians, and Hyrulean are the correct official spellings.  Hyrulian and Hyrulians were used in the manual of LA, but the spellings have since been changed.  Here’s how it works.  Hylians are the people with pointy ears who are featured in OoT, and who were said to be able to communicate telepathically in ALttP.  The “Hylian Shield” in OoT was a product made by them, so it is Hylian.  It’s kind of like how a product made in China would technically be called Chinese.  Now, as for Hyrulean, you may have seen it used to describe Link’s adventure in FSA.  The easiest way for me to define Hyrulean, would be “of Hyrule.”  All the races, Zoras, Gerudo, Gorons, and Hylians are Hyrulean, because they live in Hyrule.  They are of Hyrule.  It’s similar to one’s personal heritage, I believe.  I personally am an American citizen, so I’m American, but my heritage is mostly Italian, so I’m Italian as well.  Link’s adventure in FSA takes place in Hyrule, so it is also described as Hyrulean.  Hyrulians means the same as Hylians, I believe, but it’s not correct.  The same goes for Hyrulian.  It would have the same meaning as Hyrulean, but it’s not correct either.  Also, Link is a Hylian in every game.  He’s not an elf, as some people still say.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Section 4-Number of Timelines<br>
</span></span><br>
It used to be that nobody really knew whether there were two timelines or one.  Many people had their ideas on the subject, and would have had you believe that they were right, but up until recently, no one really knew.  However, in TSA’s previously mentioned interview, he said that Eiji Aonuma admitted that his quote about the two endings of Ocarina of Time was meant to convey two timelines.  Here’s the little Q&amp;A session:</p>
<p>Q: Where does The Wind Waker fit into the overall Zelda series timeline?<br>
Aonuma: You can think of this game as taking place over a hundred years after Ocarina of Time. You can tell this from the opening story, and there are references to things from Ocarina located throughout the game as well.<br>
Miyamoto: Well, wait, which point does the hundred years start from?<br>
Aonuma: From the end.<br>
Miyamoto: No, I mean, as a child or as a…<br>
Aonuma: Oh, right, let me elaborate on that. Ocarina of Time basically has two endings of sorts; one has Link as a child and the other has him as an adult. This game, The Wind Waker, takes place a hundred years* after the adult Link defeats Ganon at the end of Ocarina.<br>
Miyamoto: This is pretty confusing for us, too. (laughs) So be careful.</p>
<p>*Now, this isn’t the best translated interview ever, but Japanese and English don’t translate perfectly, so it’s not a big deal.  The biggest mistranslation is the 100 years thing.  It should be hundreds of years after the adult ending of OoT, so just keep that in mind.  And ignore Miyamoto’s last line as well.  The fact that he didn’t sound sure of himself used to be used as pro-single timeline evidence, but TSA’s interview clears that up.  Besides, Aonuma’s the guy more concerned with the timeline anyway.</p>
<p>Here’s the link to the entire article/interview with the quote: <a href="http://www.zeldalegends.net/index.php?p=233&amp;style=tww" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.zeldalegends.net/index.php?p=233&amp;style=tww</a></p>
<p>And here’s the link to TSA’s article: <a href="http://www.zhq2.com/eiji_exclusive_part1.shtml" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.zhq2.com/eiji_exclusive_part1.shtml</a></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Section 5-How the Double Timeline Theory Works</span></span></p>
<p>This section, as you may have guessed, is about how the double timeline theory works. I’ve noticed from reading countless threads that many people who supported the single timeline theory had no clue how the double timeline theory works, so they went with the easier one to understand. Even many double timeline believers seem to not know too much about how it works. Before I begin, I must give some credit to andor3, as he is the one who explained most of this to me, when I was one of the people who believed the single timeline theory simply because I really didn’t understand the double timeline one.   Now that the double timeline theory has been confirmed, I think it’s a good idea to explain it to all the people who believed the single timeline theory, or even those who believe the double timeline theory, but don’t know the finer points of it.</p>
<p>So, after that lengthy introduction, I’ll begin. First of all, it’s not the “Adult OoT timeline” and the “Child OoT Timeline.” It’s the “Old Timeline” and the “New Timeline.” Here’s why. First there was one timeline. And it went TMC-FS-OoT. And yes, TMC and FS are the first two in the timeline. Read this if you don’t believe me. <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200405/N04.0517.1915.59084.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200405/N04.0517.1915.59084.htm</a></p>
<p>Anyway. At the end of OoT when Zelda sent Link back in time, it created a copy of the events that happened previously, namely TMC and FS. Those events didn’t just get erased from history, they still happened. Now, this becomes the “New” timeline, and it actually doesn’t include OoT at all if you think about it. Zelda sent Link back in time to a point where he had done none of the events included in OoT, because he didn’t have to. Ganon is absent from the New Timeline because he is sealed in the Sacred Realm, which is possibly unaffected by time. Now, Link still has his memories from OoT in the Old timeline, so he sets off what would be 3 months after pulling the Master Sword in the Old Timeline, to search for Navi.</p>
<p>That’s the part that I think is most difficult to understand/explain; that OoT is not a part of the New Timeline. Let’s pretend for a moment that in the Old Timeline, Young Link pulled the Master Sword from the Pedestal of Time on May 7th, 1246. Now, in the New Timeline, Link leaves for Termina on August 7th, 1246. That’s what’s meant by MM taking place three months after OoT. Because if you think about it, in the New Timeline, there is no need for Link to gather Spiritual Stones or pull out the sword, because there is no Ganon threatening Hyrule. Link simply wishes to look for Navi, so he leaves. So, that makes the New Timeline look like this.</p>
<p>The beginning of time and all events preceding TMC-TMC-FS-The Hero of Time’s life until 3 months after he pulled the Master Sword in the Old Timeline-MM.</p>
<p>So yes, it is easier to just say Child OoT, but here I’m just explaining that the events of OoT never took place in the New Timeline.</p>
<p>Now, back in the Old Timeline, there is no Link. He’s vanished because he was sent back in time by Zelda. So the Old Timeline continues Linkless and Ganonless until a few decades later, sometime before Twilight Princess, when a new Link is born, and Ganon breaks out of the Sacred Realm. We don’t yet know the events of TP, but we do know that Ganon appears in TP and TWW, so if he is sealed away or killed in TP, he breaks out or is revived yet again. Now, the Old Timeline includes all the games after the ending of OoT, minus MM. So the Old Timeline looks like this.</p>
<p>The beginning of time and all events preceding TMC-TMC-FS-OoT-TP-TWW-all the rest of the games.</p>
<p>So, a quick recap</p>
<p>Old Timeline-The beginning of time and all events preceding TMC-TMC-FS-OoT-TP-TWW-all the rest of the games.</p>
<p>Zelda sending Link back at the end of OoT in the Old Timeline creates the New Timeline and makes a copy of all the events from the beginning of time, to the date that Link, in the Old Timeline, pulled the Master Sword out of the Pedestal of Time.</p>
<p>New Timeline-The beginning of time and all events preceding TMC-TMC-FS-The Hero of Time’s life until 3 months after he pulled the Master Sword in the Old Timeline-MM.</p>
<p>Now, at the end of OoT, I’ve been told that you see young Link standing in the Temple of Time, presumably after Zelda sent him back.  If this is the case, then Child OoT can be a part of the New Timeline, so ignore what I said about that earlier.  This means that Link already would have collected all the Spiritual Stones and pulled the MS.  If that’s what you believe, then include Child OoT as part of the New Timeline.  Then as for MM, Link would just leave three months after he got back to his own time, which is most likely right before he pulled out the MS.  It all depends on where (well when, but whatever) you believe Zelda sent Link back to.  If you believe it was before he did any Spiritual Stone collecting, go with the earlier explanation.  If you believe it was just a little while before he pulled the Master Sword, go with the one in this paragraph.</p>
<p>Final Note, the Old and New timelines can also be called the Adult OoT timeline, and Child OoT timeline, if it’s easier to remember, even though those terms may be less correct.  I’ve also heard them called the Imprisoning War timeline and the MM timeline.  So, pick the names you like best.</p>
<p>Alright, I’d like to apologize because re-reading this section, I realized some of this is probably difficult to understand, but I’d be happy to answer any questions anybody has.</p>
<p>And Dark-I will still ask a mod if you are right…</p>

        <p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Section 6-Game Order</span></span></p>
<p>Before I begin this section, I just want to say one thing.  Right now, 10 of the 13 games have nearly definite places.  The three that don’t are FSA, OoA, and OoS.  Darken Poltergeist has a very interesting alternate theory regarding the placement of the games with nearly definite places, so be sure to read his section, which is included later in the FAQ.</p>
<ol>
<li>TMC and FS are the first two games in the series.  It used to be OoT, but now it’s not.  Again, read this article if you don’t believe me.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200405/N04.0517.1915.59084.htm" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200405/N04.0517.1915.59084.htm</a></p>
<p>Now keep in mind that this article was made when FSA was the latest in the series, so TMC hadn’t been created yet. And any information regarding TP, or TWW 2, as it’s called in this article, can be ignored. The important part is question number 6 and Eiji Aonuma’s answer. He says FS is first, but most people who have played TMC should be able to figure out that it comes before FS as TMC explains the history and origin of Vaati, FS’s main villain.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>OoT was first in the series prior to that article, so we’ll put it at third in the series.  The biggest debate about OoT is whether or not it’s the “Imprisoning War” described in ALttP.  Check section 11 for more information on the Imprisoning War.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, MM is 3 months after the Child Ending of OoT, but that takes some complicated explanations, and I’m not going to repeat them.  MM ends this timeline, but the other one continues.  Also, Nintendo confirmed that Link was searching for Navi.  He wasn’t searching for Saria or the Skull Kid, as some people had suspected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next we have TP, which relatively little is known about.  However, Eiji Aonuma has stated many times that it’s between OoT and TWW, and more specifically a couple of decades after OoT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TWW comes next, and takes place hundreds of years after the Adult Ending of OoT, as was stated by Aonuma.  Some people thought he said one hundred years after the Adult Ending of OoT, but that was a mistranslation.  One big debate in TWW has been over a little Easter Egg left by Tingle in one of the dungeons.  “The Legend of the Fairy,” which I’ll admit I’ve never read since I only got a GBA recently, talks about events in MM.  This lead many people to believe that TWW and MM were in the same timeline, but that’s not correct.  The Legend of the Fairy is just an Easter Egg.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, we have ALttP.  At the time of its release, ALttP was said to be a prequel to LoZ and AoL, featuring the ancestors of LoZ and AoL’s Link and Zelda.  ALttP raises many interesting issues, such as the whole Imprisoning War thing, but Impossible II is the resident ALttP expert, so refer any questions on the subject  to him.  One thing to keep in mind about this game however, is that the original SNES version was translated very poorly.  Some passages, such as the one about Ganon being “completely destroyed” are mistranslated.  This particular quote led some people to believe that ALttP was last in the timeline.  However, that’s not the case, so when looking for ALttP quotes, look at the GBA version, or better yet, the original Japanese translation, which I believe can be found on <a href="http://zeldalegends.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">zeldalegends.net</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LA comes next, and features the same Link as ALttP.  It says so in the LA manual and in another very possibly canon Zelda game, that very few know about.  It’s called The Ancient Stone Tablets, and it’s on the Satellaview system.  I’ll admit I hadn’t heard of either the game or the system until Darken Poltergeist told me about them today, November 2nd.  Without going into great detail on the story, I’ll tell you that it takes place very soon after ALttP, and you play as some random boy in the land of Hyrule who is on a quest to find eight ancient stone tablets.  The key factor is that he can’t use the power of the Triforce of Courage, because it already has a holder in Link, and he’s away on a quest, which is indirectly said to be LA in the game.  Now, Darken Poltergeist knows much more about this game than I do, so ask him if you want to find out more about it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, another common misconception is that this particular part of the series goes ALttP-Oracles-LA, because of the fact that Link ends the Oracle games on a boat, and starts out on a boat in LA.  However, that is wrong.  Here’s why:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>ALttP Link knows Zelda at the end of his game, whereas Oracle Link doesn’t know Zelda at the beginning of his game. Therefore, they cannot be the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALttP Link set out on a journey because he wanted to, of his own free will. And it says so in the manual to LA. Oracle Link had no idea he was being sent on a quest when he went into the castle and saw the Triforce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impa doesn’t know Link in the Oracles. If she was Zelda’s personal nursemaid, you would think she would know the hero who saved Zelda and Hyrule in ALttP, if those Links were the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impa notices a Triforce mark on Oracle Link’s hand. ALttP Link doesn’t have one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impa says Oracle Link is fated to become a hero. ALttP Link is already a proven hero by the time the Oracles occur.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zelda did not send Impa to find Link in the Oracles, she sent Impa to escort either Nayru or Din back to Hyrule. Obviously, that plan did not work, so Impa turned to Oracle Link for help, as he had the triangle on the back of his hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know that LA Link starts out his quest on a boat, and that Oracle Link ends his quest on a boat, but the boats do not look like they are the same. LA’s boat is longer and the sails are placed more towards the front of the boat. I think if the creators intended LA and Oracle Link to be the same, they would have made sure that Oracle Link’s boat looked exactly like LA Link’s boat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next in the series comes LoZ.  Ganon actually dies at the end of this one, although he may or may not have died at the end of ALttP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, we have AoL.  AoL’s manual talks a lot about Ganon’s minions trying to sacrifice Link to revive Ganon.  It also explains why the series is called the Legend of Zelda, instead of The Legend of Link, as many people have wondered about.  When the events described in the manual took place is up for debate, but they are explained nonetheless.  There’s an AoL FAQ/Walkthrough that takes the AoL opening story straight from the manual.  This is the link to it so check it out if you want: <a href="http://db.gamefaqs.com/console/nes/file/zelda_ii_e.txt" rel="nofollow noopener">http://db.gamefaqs.com/console/nes/file/zelda_ii_e.txt</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(It’s a good walkthrough as well.)</p>
<p>Now, AoL would seem to be last because of the closure it provides.  Ganon is dead and gone, and the Triforce is finally fully assembled.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>So, to summarize, the order of the games whose placement has been all but confirmed looks like this.</li>
</ol>
<p>TMC-FS-OoT-TP-TWW-ALttP-LA-LoZ-AoL<br>
TMC-FS-MM</p>
<p>Now, the second timeline’s order will make more sense if you read my explanation of the double timeline theory, but it could also be TMC-FS-Child OoT-MM, depending on the point in time Zelda sent Link back to.  If it’s after when he pulled the Master Sword, then it’s the second one I mentioned.  If it’s the before that, then it’s the first one I mentioned.</p>
<p>Dont Post yet, please remove your post…[br][size=1]Posted on: December 31, 2006, 11:49:44 AM[/size][hr]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Section 7-Unconfirmed But Possibly Accurate Speculation</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How the games get from one to the other almost completely involves speculation, as not much is explained as to what went on in the world of Zelda between TP and TWW, or TWW and ALttP, or LA and LoZ, and so on.  In my timeline theory, located in a later part of the FAQ, you can see my take on how the games connect, and see my ideas for the placement of FSA and the Oracles if you want to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And that moves us nicely on to the placement of FSA.  There is one main place to put FSA, and that’s between TWW and ALttP.  Once again, the explanation involves much speculation, and can be a bit confusing, and contains talk of two Hyrules, so check out my timeline topic if you want to know the reasoning.  The non-difficult part to explain is that Ganon gets his Trident in FSA, and then goes on to use it in ALttP.  However, stayed tuned for Darken Poltergeist’s views on FSA’s placement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next is the placement of the Oracles.  I should point out that they feature a different Link than any other game, and that they can only really go in three main places.  One is Directly before ALttP, another is directly after LA, and the last one is directly after AoL.  Ask OmegaDevastator and Hardcore_Gamer7 for the before ALttP placement, me for the after LA placement, and me or Impossible II for the after AoL placement.  I personally am leaning 65% toward the after AoL placement, 25% toward the before ALttP placement, and 10% toward the after LA placement, but that’s just me.  Ask those guys to explain the finer details of their theories, and then decide for yourself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s what Omega Devastator has to say about the Pre-ALttP Oracles placement:</p>
<p>First of all, the Oracles can go in various places. They really don’t have a lot of bearing on the timeline. But wherever you put them, you have to assume a lot of things happen in the timeline before and after the games.<br>
A couple of other points first to tie it all in:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Whether the Imprisoning War is still considered OoT or not, Ganon has to somehow get sealed in the Sacred Realm again. The full Triforce must also be there. As FSA is most likely after TWW, Ganon is reborn then. Now between this and ALttP, Ganon gets unsealed from the sword and resealed in the Sacred Realm. Now, whether you think OoT is the Imprisoning War or not will probably make or break this theory for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Imprisoning War, Hylian Knights fought Ganon and did their thing. I will say this happened in OoT as well just for arguments sake. Now in LoZ and AoL, there is no clarity as to whether there are Hylians in Hyrule, or just humans. Hylians were first introduced in the series in ALttP, and It seems to suggest that there are none of them in LoZ or AoL. This is because it seems they have all died out. Now in ALttP, in the English Translation the old woman says that they have all gone now leaving magical items and those Hylian stones that you can read with the Book of Mudora. In the Japanese version, there is no real clarity as to whether they have died out completely, or that only their descendants and a very small fraction are still around. I’m sorry I don’t have direct quotes but anyone can add them in if they wish. However, the whole thing seems to suggest that they are pretty much gone. If not during ALttP, then soon after. Hence why the book of Mudora exists so you can translate the language. Now in OoS, if you play it as the second in a linked game, a member of Din’s dance troupe will say, “We’re not really dancers, we’re Hylian Knights!” Hylians still exist in these games and I’m gonna say this now before I get some prat spurting crap about “how Capcom ruined Zelda.” I really doubt that Nintendo would have allowed Capcom to make a Zelda game without knowing the series’ mythology and key elements so that they wouldn’t make up random crap. So if  the Imprisoning War featured Hylian Knights (for now I’m going to say the war, or another war happened after my placement of OoA/S) and the game that followed this mentioned Hylians becoming “extinct” if you will, then since OoA/S features these people, it should go before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Master Sword in OoA/S. Now even I think it’s merely a cameo, but it still exists in these games. Whether you put it down to a cameo or not changes the placement. I’m going to use it as a “point” just to help my part of the timeline to flow better. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And here’s what Impossible II has to say on the Post-AoL Oracles placement:</p>
<p>There are a couple of different things to note when explaining that the Oracles must come after LoZ and AoL, so I’ll do one at a time.</p>
<p>The first thing is Ganon. At the start of the Oracles, Ganon is dead. At the end of the Oracles, Ganon is dead. He only really “dies”/is defeated without being sealed three times during the series besides at the end of a linked Oracle playthrough. The only time we are 100% certain that he is dead is in the original LoZ, because AoL says that Ganon is dead as can be, but it also clearly says that he can be revived. Ganon’s being dead can’t be from TWW, because the Oracles were made earlier and the story wasn’t really planned in reverse. Ganon had to be dead from something else - besides that, if the Oracles were before ALttP, then Ganon would have to somehow die after FSA, and then he’d have to come back to life and be sealed in the Sacred Realm/Dark World before ALttP. It also seems more likely that the Oracles are after AoL than after LA because we don’t actually know what happened to Ganon in ALttP. He can’t have been completely dead, because he lives in LoZ and there is nothing to suggest that he came back to life (without dying again immediately) in that time.<br>
Also, in the Oracles, Ganon is revived as a soulless shell, while in every other game he’s sentient. He dies after that, so the Oracles can’t be stated to have any major bearing on the timeline (not enough that they need to be placed somewhere else).</p>
<p>Then we have the Triforce, which is in Hyrule and most likely Hyrule Castle in the Oracles. The only time in the series when the entire Triforce is in the possession of the Royal Family is after AoL. It is united in ALttP, but there is nothing to suggest that Link kept it or brought it with him, and the opposite seems more likely. It is united in TWW, but it most likely returned to the Sacred Realm after that - certainly nobody had it between TWW and the next game, and nobody was able to take it, so it returned to where it came from (perhaps in time for ALttP?).</p>
<p>And here’s what I have to say about the Post-LA Oracles placement:</p>
<p>Frankly, this is the least likely of the three.  It only goes there because it’s possible, not because there’s any great evidence supporting it.  It works because the Triforce was united at the end of ALttP, and Ganon also died in that game, he wasn’t just sealed away, so the two conditions are satisfied.  However, there’s no other evidence to back it up, so I’d go with the other two theories if I were you, as they’re better supported, but this placement is still a possibility, so keep an open mind.</p>
<p>So there.  Those are the facts, those are the opinions, and that’s the evidence.  Decide for yourself which theory you believe.</p>
<p>Now, here’s why they can only go in those places.  Each of those placements follows a game where the Triforce has been united by the end of it, and that’s a necessity, as the Triforce is whole in the beginning (and through the whole thing) of the Oracle games.  Next, Ganon is revived in a linked Oracles playthrough, so they have to go after a game where the Triforce is whole, and Ganon is dead.  That means they can’t go before TWW, and have to be in one of the three places previously mentioned.</p>
<p>There are two other important things to mention about the Oracles.  One is that some people think they can’t be at the end because of the cryptic quote at the end of ALttP, “And the Master Sword Sleeps Again… FOREVER!”  It’s up for debate whether Nintendo was just trying to be dramatic, or if they intended for the MS never to be used in a game that follows ALttP in the timeline.  This is the problem.  The MS is unlockable in a linked Oracles playthrough.  However, I personally believe it’s just an Easter Egg, because it really isn’t explained at all how Patch, or King Zora, or some random guy underneath the clock shop would come to acquire the Legendary Blade of Evil’s Bane.  Also, in a linked playthrough, finding the MS isn’t necessary to complete the game.  In every other game featuring that sword (ALttP, OoT, TWW) it was necessary to find the MS to advance the plot.  That’s not the case in the Oracles.</p>
<p>The second thing is the appearance of the three Oracles in the town square in TMC.  Now, I’d personally go with treating that as just a cameo, which Capcom happen to love, by the way.  Also, since it just says they’re descendants of some Oracles from Holodrum and Labrynna, it’s perfectly possible that the three Oracle ladies from OoA and OoS are descendants of the three that you see in TMC.  But, in the end, I believe it’s just Capcom demonstrating their love for putting characters from Capcom games into other Capcom games.</p>

        <p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Section 8-My Timeline Theory</span></span></p>
<p>Without further ado, here’s my timeline theory.  After its third edition it finally reached 500, so I see no need to make another topic completely dedicated to it, so I’m including it here.</p>
<p>Into to TMC-TMC-FS-Child OoT-MM<br>
Intro to TMC-TMC-FS-OoT-TP-TWW-FSA-ALttP-LA–LoZ-AoL-Oracles</p>
<p>Okay. Now, I’ll explain my timeline. The intro to TMC shows a Link with no hat who was given the Lightforce and a sword by the Picori. I think that may be the first Link and the first Hyrule. TMC features the second Link, but still the first Hyrule. FS gives us the third Link, but still the same Hyrule. Now, something happens to that land, which forces the people to leave, and they find the Hyrule of OoT. They settle there, and after many years, OoT happens with the fourth Link in the second Hyrule. MM occurs, still fourth Link. OoT causes the split, so TP happens in one timeline, and MM happens in the other. Now, the split causes the events before OoT to become copied into the new timeline, so that’s why TMC and FS appear twice. Also, TP Hyrule is the same as OoT Hyrule, and TP Link is the fifth one in this timeline. Then TWW happens. It shows us the sixth Link, but still the second Hyrule, only it’s flooded. Okay, nothing too radical here. Now, I start to speculate wildly. The “new land” Link and Tetra search for happens to be the old Hyrule that TMC Link (and FS and the Intro to TMC Links) lived in. Now, because of whatever crisis caused the people to leave, the seal on the Four Sword has weakened considerably, so Vaati is free to break out whenever he wants.  So, he bides his time until there are enough pretty maidens to suit him, then breaks free. Also, the landscape has changed drastically. Because of these things, FSA can happen, featuring the seventh Link.</p>
<p>Hundreds or maybe thousands of years pass, and TWW’s Hyrule eventually gets unflooded. This is possible because the King of Hyrule wished for the land to be washed away, not for the land to stay flooded forever. Now, I don’t think he meant for the goddesses to create a big gaping hole where the land used to be, because then the water would disappear into the hole. I think he meant for the goddesses to wash away the castle and the towns and such. The mountains, hills, and all that other good stuff would still remain. So, eventually, the flood waters would recede, and the evidence of any people or creatures having lived there in the past would be gone.</p>
<p>Then, more decades or centuries later, the people of FSA’s Hyrule stumble into that old land and explore it for a while, and decide to settle there. Years, pass then ALttP happens, with Link number 8. LA then happens, also with Link 8. Now, again, this is all speculation, but I think that since the flood happened, a drought must happen sometime to balance it out.  That tends to happen in nature sometimes. This awful drought turns ALttP’s lush Hyrule into LoZ’s barren, sparsely populated one. So, Link 9 kills Ganon in LoZ, and then finally reassembles the Triforce in AoL. The reason AoL’s map is so different is because it is a different part of Hyrule, north of Death Mountain. That’s why DM is at the bottom of the map.  Many years later, a new Link, number 10, is drawn to the castle where the Triforce sends him on a mission, and so, the Oracles occur.  Ganon is dead in the end, the Triforce is still resting peacefully in the castle, and everyone can live happily ever after.</p>
<p>Okay, there it is. There are many gaps of hundreds or thousands of years between games, but there would be no way to know exactly how long each gap is, so I just didn’t bother going into great detail on that. And I know it’s a bit confusing in some parts, but oh well.</p>
<p>The one minor inconsistency in the timeline that I couldn’t get around no matter how hard I tried was having TMC and FS take place in the same land. FS’s map is not a complete map and looks nothing like any other Zelda map, but it does feature the Four Sword and the Four Sword Shrine, so I guess it takes place in a part of TMC’s Hyrule not on the map. Perhaps the FS shrine is deep inside the Minish Woods. I don’t know.  Also, the intro to TMC talks about a time long past, so that would place it before TMC.</p>

<p>Original Timeline: TMC - FS - OoT, which splits into<br>
Child Timeline: MM - FSA - ALttP - LA - LoZ - AoL - OoA/OoS<br>
Adult Timeline: OoT - TP - TWW</p>
<p>As one can see, I didn’t include OoT in the Child Timeline, as Link was sent back in time before the events of OoT really unraveled (read: before pulling out the Master Sword), thus making it as if OoT never happened in that timeline. In the future timeline, the events remained in place, and thus things take off from there.</p>
<p>Also, in order for this timeline to really make sense, I made the assumption (with evidence that I’ll provide later) that there are indeed two Ganons, one in each timeline. The first, as we all know, was sealed in the Sacred Realm in the future, only to get out before TWW, and again during the events of that game. The second one remained alive and unsealed in the past, but with the path to the Sacred Realm closed by the Master Sword, there was no way for him to get in, rendering him relatively harmless. It’s not until a couple of decades later, during FSA (again, more evidence later), that he finds the Magic Trident, and gains power through that instead of the Triforce. There’s a conundrum here regarding the Imprisoning War, and how OoT was intended to be that event, but I believe that FSA, along with the Royal Family’s knowledge of Link’s exploits in the future, make up for it.</p>
<p>One more thing. Before anyone tries taking quotes from ALttP or its manual (whether it is to disprove my points or reinforce them), know that the original American release was mistranslated, text and quotes were purposely changed, and NoA even made stuff up in the manual. In other words, the original American release is crap, story-wise. If you’re going to quote ALttP, at least make sure it’s the GBA version, though the original Japanese is preferable.</p>
<p>Now, one main problem with his theory is the whole Dark World thing.  It’s been debated whether the Dark Worlds of ALttP and FSA are the same, and here’s what Darken Poltergeist had to say about it.</p>
<p>Ah, yes. The Dark World inconsistency. This one is also a doozy, but one that I’ve given lots and lots of thought following the post that first brought it up. My conclusion may surprise some of you, so I ask for you to keep an open mind.</p>
<p>Alright, let’s begin first by examining the nature of the Dark World in both FSA and ALttP. As we all know, the Dark World in ALttP is merely a perverse, twisted version of the Sacred Realm, made to closely mirror Hyrule through Ganon’s wish to the Triforce. I put emphasis on that last part, because you have to remember that, according to my theory, Ganon should not have been able to get the Triforce after the Child Ending of OoT. As I stated earlier, Ganondorf became Ganon through the Magic Trident, and didn’t get the Triforce until after FSA. Thus, the Sacred Realm had not become the Dark World at that time yet.</p>
<p>So, why is there a Dark World in FSA, then? Simple. They’re not the same Dark World. In FSA, the Dark World is a result of the Dark Mirror’s magic, which, according to in-game text, had been used in the past to imprison an evil tribe. Well, Ganondorf got ahold of the Mirror, and used it not only to create Shadow Link, but also to unleash the Dark World in the Mirror, where the creatures of evil were sealed, and allowed them to escape into the real world. FSA’s Dark World, then, is only a twisted reflection of Hyrule made by the Magic Mirror, but it’s by no means the Sacred Realm. IMO, it is only called the Dark World so people with knowledge of the series may recognize the premise of a mirror world; nothing but a bit of nostalgia, if you will. Notice that in ALttP, however, the Magic Mirror is used to travel between the Light World and the Dark World. This isn’t explained directly, but it may be that, as a Mirror with once extraordinary powers, it is able to resonate with the Dark World of ALttP because of its evil powers.</p>
<p>However, that last part is somewhat speculative. It may be that the creators intended for the Dark World to be the same, though why they didn’t explain it is beyond me. Had they fully fleshed out the existence of the Dark World, I would not have written this wall of text. I mean, in the game, it’s as if the Dark World is no big deal: “Oh, you have the Four Sword! Now you can repel evil. Oh, and you also get to see the Dark World.” I’m beginning to think that the existence of the Dark World was mainly for gameplay purposes, in order to show off the capabilities of the GBA-GCN connectivity. I doubt it’s supposed to have a strong impact on the placement of this game in the story or the timeline. Still, from what I understand from the game, the Dark World is simply a twisted interpretation of Hyrule, while the one in ALttP is an entirely new world altogether.</p>
<p>People have said that my timeline is radically different from other peoples’, especially TE9. However, I don’t consider that to be the case at all. Yes, I switched the games that go after OoT around. However, that’s pretty much the only change. All the games are still in the same order. The only difference is that instead of most of the games taking place after TWW, they take place after MM instead. I did this for many reasons, ones which I thought about for a long time. You see, I always supported the double timeline theory, but the way people had most games go after TWW (starting with ALttP, no less) didn’t sit too well with me. Thus, I took a close look at several factors to see if there was an alternative.</p>
<p>An often overlooked factor, yet a very important one, is geography. ALttP has VERY similar geography to both FSA and OoT. If you stretch it, you can even argue that LoZ has similarities as well. However, in order for this to be true, they would have to take place in the same Hyrule. TWW ruined all chances of this happening in the Adult Timeline. At the end, Hyrule is washed away, its locations forgotten, and its legend disappeared. I refuse to believe that somehow, Link and Zelda manage to find a new land to be called Hyrule, with uncannily similar geography to the Hyrule of old, and with the same locations, to boot (Lake Hylia, Kakariko Village, etc.). Thus, any Zelda games that take place after TWW will NOT be in the same land. Thus, FSA, ALttP, and even LoZ cannot take place in this timeline. As far as the Adult Timeline goes, Hyrule is done. Its legend is no more. So, where does that place the games after OoT, then? Why, in the Child Timeline, of course, where Ganon was not sealed away, and thus no need for a deluge. Hyrule stays intact for the remainder of that timeline.</p>
<p>TE9’s note: If you read my timeline theory, you’ll notice that I don’t refuse to accept the part DP does, as I believe they actually eventually find the same Hyrule of old.  But this is his theory, so I’ll let you read the rest.  Also, there’s more on the whole geography issue later.</p>
<p>Another factor was Ganon’s appearance in FSA. I already explained why there are two Ganons in my last post. Now I will provide the evidence. In FSA, Ganon starts out as Ganondorf, King of the Gerudo, a mere mortal without inhuman powers, unlike his future self. If Ganondorf is still a mortal, running around Hyrule and just generally not being sealed away, that means FSA goes directly after OoT in the Child Timeline. Of course, since this is a new Link, that means that the game must take place at least a couple of decades after OoT, just enough for a new Link to appear, but also enough for Ganondorf to still be alive. Disgruntled that he cannot access the Sacred Realm, Ganondorf searches for other means to gain power, but his ambition ends up getting him exiled from the Gerudo tribe. By the way, read that sentence again. Yes, notice the Gerudo part? That’s right, you won’t find any of those in TWW, not counting Ganondorf. Yet they’re alive and kicking in FSA, only to disappear by ALttP. In any case, just about everyone knows of Ganondorf, but only as a man of the desert, not as a serious threat. That is, until he draws the Trident. The one thing that may break down this entire theory is Zelda’s comment on Ganon being an “ancient demon reborn”. Even though I don’t know for sure, I’m not so sure that we’re supposed to take this comment literally. If we could get a translation of that line from the Japanese version, that might clear up a few things.</p>
<p>Now, as Impossible II has said, we don’t know if this, “In FSA, Ganon starts out as Ganondorf, King of the Gerudo, a mere mortal without inhuman powers, unlike his future self,” is completely true.  So, here’s DP with a small clarification.</p>
<p>I worded that a bit incorrectly. I didn’t mean to say during the events of FSA, I meant before. By the time the game begins, Ganon had already stolen the Dark Mirror and the Magic Trident, had created the Dark World, and had killed the Knights of Hyrule. However, while Zelda and the maidens where oblivious to these events, they knew of Ganondorf as nothing but a desert nomad. In fact, when you first hear about Ganon, one of the maidens remarks that the only person she can think of is Ganondorf, but that it made no sense for the Deku Scrubs to be worshiping a nomad, and that there was probably no connection.</p>
<p>So there you have it, Darken Poltergeist’s slightly unorthodox yet completely possible theory.  I’m starting to like it better than my own, in fact, but nevermind.  Decide for yourself whose theory you believe.  His, mine, yours, or any of the others.</p>

<p>The Geography of the many lands that feature in the Zelda universe is an extremely important factor in trying to figure out the timeline.  Now, there are a few games that don’t take place in Hyrule, so their maps have little to no bearing on this subject.  Those games are LA, MM, OoA, OoS and TWW.  TWW’s geography doesn’t affect the timeline much because Hyrule is flooded and we only ever see a map of the islands, not the Hyrule of OoT or ALttP itself.  Now, there are two generally well accepted/and or confirmed “sets” of games.  Those two sets are TMC-FS-OoT and FSA-ALttP-LoZ-AoL.  Now, stuff like LA coming after ALttP isn’t included in those sets simply for the ease of explaining the geography.  That doesn’t mean it’s not confirmed, though.  Anyway, here are links to all those maps, except for FS’s, which I’ll explain in a second.</p>

<p>FS’s map isn’t included because it really doesn’t fit in with any others.  We know it comes in between TMC and OoT, so it’s safe to say that it takes place in the same Hyrule as TMC, because I don’t think it would be possible for the Four Sword Shrine to just jump from land to land.  So, my explanation is going to be that FS’s map just shows some major landmarks in the land of Hyrule, because as you’ll have noticed in LoZ and AoL’s maps, the land of Hyrule is extremely vast.  Now, on to the more interesting stuff.</p>
<p>It’s been highly suspected that OoT and ALttP take place in the same Hyrule.  There is strong evidence to support that.  Here are some interesting pictures, courtesy of Impossible II.</p>
<p>ALttP’s map turned clockwise (looks somewhat like OoT’s map):<br>

</p>
<p>Compare the first map to the OoT map given earlier, and the second map to the ALttP map given earlier.  They look quite similar.  However, there are a few inconsistencies, so here’s more from Impossible II.</p>
<p>In some games (OoT, FSA), the map of Hyrule is made to distinctly resemble that of in another game (well, ALttP). Rotate ALttP’s map slightly (around 45 degrees) clockwise and it bears a striking resemblance to OoT’s map. FSA’s is based on ALttP’s. There are minor differences with both, but I don’t think they can become major arguments. There is the Lake Hylia/Eastern Hyrule issue in FSA, which I will get to later, and of course the positioning of Lake Hylia in OoT which is a little off from ALttP. For the most part I think these are for gameplay reasons – for example, Nintendo wanted Gerudo Valley to lead right into Lake Hylia.<br>
There are also the huge differences in map design and layout between the games, which create some inconsistencies. In ALttP, the map actually represents the entire overworld and you’re always in a specific place on it. In OoT, maps are a bit more general – Death Mountain is an actual mountain, and quite tall, while in ALttP it all had to be on a 2D map and so it took up a lot more space. This also, of course, creates issues with the positioning of Kakariko, which is generally at least ROUGHLY at the foot of Death Mountain, or somewhere near it. It moves from the west to east of the map in OoT because of the way Death Mountain is structured, and again for gameplay reasons. You can also argue that at some point the town was simply destroyed and rebuilt further to the west. This is probably a fair assumption, so we’ll leave it there and get started.</p>
<p>From ALttP to OoT (release order, not chronological), the desert moves from southwest to west, Lake Hylia moves from southeast to south/southwest, Zora’s River moves from northeast to east, Eastern Hyrule is replaced mostly with Kokiri Forest, the Lost Woods, and the nothing in the south-east of Hyrule Field, and Death Mountain is a bit more firmly in the northeast rather than taking up a considerable amount of the northern map, also shifting the position of Kakariko in the process.  This is at least in part a result of a 3D and actual map/overworld, and also for gameplay purposes; having Kakariko at the foot of Death Mountain.</p>
<p>The biggest inconsistency is the Lost Woods.  No matter which way you look at it, the Lost Woods are not in the same place on the two maps.  So, again, here’s more from Impossible II.</p>
<p>There are three potential Lost Woods theories, from three different people (me, a friend, and Zelda Legends):</p>
<p>Old Lost Woods was destroyed/burned down, Goddesses create a new Lost Woods where the ruins of old Hyrule Castle were to protect the Master Sword (which, according to the JP ALttP manual, the Goddesses told the Hylians to forge and would have had reason to want to keep protecting).</p>
<p>The magical/warping properties of the Lost Woods caused the forest to grow through a warp, which happened to lead to a different part of Hyrule (ALttP NW), and the original Lost Woods was destroyed or burnt or something.</p>
<p>There are two Lost Woods. In this theory, we’re seeing the map in each game from a different perspective, so theoretically ALttP’s Lost Woods were always there in OoT. They were just north of Hyrule Castle, but we couldn’t see them or go there, presumably because of the clouds on the map blocking our view.</p>
<p>So, all this seems to suggest that ALttP and OoT take place in the same Hyrule.  FSA’s map and ALttP’s map are nearly identical as well. Now, comparing LoZ and ALttP’s map, you’ll notice some similarities, and many people, including myself believe that LoZ and ALttP take place in the same Hyrule as well.  If you’ll recall my drought idea in my timeline theory, you’ll remember that it’s possible for ALttP and LoZ to take place in the same Hyrule.  Now, that leads us nicely to AoL’s map.  It is also huge, and looks quite different from LoZ’s map.  However, you’ll notice that in AoL, Death Mountain is toward the southeast of the map.  In EVERY other LoZ game that featured it, Death Mountain was in the uppermost area of the map.  The fact that it’s at the bottom hear seems to lend support to the idea that the land of Hyrule is enormous, and that AoL just takes place in a different part of this gigantic land.  This means that the northernmost part of LoZ takes place in the southernmost area of AoL.  That should give you a good idea of how humongous Hyrule really is.</p>
<p>So, thus far we’ve established that TMC and FS take place in the same land, and that OoT, FSA, ALttP, LoZ, and AoL do as well.  So, that got me to wondering, is it possible that TMC and FS take place in that land as well?  Thanks to a find by OmegaDevastator and Valiento, I believe the answer may be yes.  Pull up TMC’s map and ALttP’s map.  Overlap their maps at Lake Hylia.  You’ll notice that Hyrule castle and Lake Hylia, and even the desert areas, are in the exact same spots.  That strongly suggests that TMC takes place in an area of Hyrule that’s slightly to the south of where OoT and ALttP and FSA take place.</p>
<p>So the final conclusion is that there is in fact, only one Hyrule.  It can get flooded, unflooded, and many of the games take place in different parts of it, but that there may be only one Hyrule after all.  Having only one Hyrule certainly makes the timeline easier to figure out, as no complicated explanations, such as my TWW to FSA explanation, are required to get the games to flow in a certain order.  Now, I rather like my TWW to FSA explanation, but that’s not the point.  The last thing I have to say is that the single-Hyrule theory does lend more support to DP’s theory, where TWW is last in the Old Timeline.  This is because of something Impossible II said in his old timeline theory topic.  When coming up with a theory, you should try to pick the one that involves the least amount of speculation.  Now, it’s possible that after TWW, Zelda and Link found a new land, and then many decades later, Hyrule’s waters had receded and they stumbled across Old Hyrule, but there’s nothing in-game or otherwise to suggest that.  So yeah, there being one Hyrule is more likely than there being two.  One final thing: whether Hyrule is just a country/continent or the whole planet is up for debate.  I personally believe it’s the country because of Zelda’s quote in OoT about Ganondorf wanting to conquer Hyrule, nay the entire world.  The fact that there are other places you can visit, like Holodrum and Labrynna, lends support to this theory.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b"><br>
Section 11-The Imprisoning War</span></span></p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, the Imprisoning War is the cause of probably the biggest debate regarding OoT and ALttP.  Is OoT the Imprisoning War that ALttP’s manual mentioned?</p>
<p>Here’s a link to the manual of ALttP: <a href="http://www.zeldalegends.net/files/text/manuals/zelda3/z3manual.txt" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.zeldalegends.net/files/text/manuals/zelda3/z3manual.txt</a></p>
<p>Now, it is the original SNES English version, so it’s poorly translated.  A lot of stuff was thrown in or changed.  Go here to see the changes that were made from the JPN version to the NTSC version: <a href="http://www.zeldalegends.net/index.php?n=z3translation" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.zeldalegends.net/index.php?n=z3translation</a></p>
<p>Hopefully you read the basic story in the first link, because if you didn’t this section won’t make much sense.  You can read the comparisons later if you feel like it.  Now, the biggest difference between the Imprisoning War and OoT’s story is that in the IW, Ganon acquires the whole Triforce.  In OoT, he just gets the Triforce of Power.  However, as Impossible II has pointed out, Ganon can only acquire the Triforce and become the Great King of Evil once.  So that means that the in Old Timeline, which includes all of OoT, OoT pretty much has to be the Imprisoning War.  The whole Triforce/Triforce of Power thing could simply be considered a relatively minor inconsistency.  However, if you believe Darken Poltergeist’s timeline theory, then this isn’t necessarily the case.  OoT isn’t the Imprisoning War, it’s an Imprisoning War.  OoT can be the IW in the Old Timeline, and in the New Timeline, another IW can happen, and this one can follow the story given in the manual to the letter.  This IW can take place anytime between the end of MM and the beginning of ALttP.  So basically, the IW is open to interpretation, and can probably go any number of places, but it an important detail, so that’s why it got its own section, however small.</p>

        <p>i love legend of zelda, and would love to read all of this stuff you have written but im tierd… and its too long no offence, good effort.</p>
<p>oh and also:</p>
<blockquote>5.  TWW comes next, and takes place hundreds of years after the Adult Ending of OoT, as was stated by Aonuma.  Some people thought he said one hundred years after the Adult Ending of OoT, but that was a mistranslation.</blockquote>
<p>can you tell me where this mistranslation was? because i’ve always looked at tww as nearly exaclty 100 years after Oot.</p>

        <blockquote>that easter eggs thingy in tww (i lost the spot 2 quote it :s)</blockquote>
even though the events of mm don't go through on the 2nd timeline, this doesn't mean that tremina field didn't exist in the 2nd timeline, thus kinda connecting jingle (or what ever he's called), or his kids to hyrule. this might sound confusing, but it's mostly koz i'm posting this at 2am and neeed sleep

        <p>well twilight princess is realted to loads of the games, theres the bird that you can rob from and if you dont pay for it, he will attack you ( i think this is on LA ), hyrule field ( on OoT (maybe more )) twilight realm is sort of like the dark realm thingy on another game i cant remember which one but ive been in it ( ive played all the zledas so i get confused ), epona on OoT and MM, master sword ( on pretty much all zeldas <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> ) thats not what your asking for i know i was just posting it oh and also since people have been posting that the detail in TP is crap its not theres alot of detail:<br>
when you haste epone while you draw your sword link holds the sword above his head<br>
when you open doors for the frist time dirt will fall if you open it again it will not<br>
if you stand behind epona and mount you will jump over her ass onto the sadle<br>
if you dismount epona while going into battle you will do a backflip off</p>
<p>also if this part is just for interest of people:<br>
if you look on the back o the Wii case of TP the second picture down has a magic bar which has been dropped from the game<br>
the Wii version is mirrored to the gamecube version ( i think its vertically mirrorred )<br>
if you go to the fishing hole and go into the hut theres a picture of the fishing hut owner of OoT and if you look at it the woman will scratch her back and say hes a legendary fisherman he used to scratch his back in the OoT.</p>
<p>TP Hints<br>
yeah well im putting this in anyways but it may SPOIL things for people if they dont like it being spoilt dont read here:</p>
<p>the male and female version of the bugs are in the same area as each other<br>
the hylian loach is in the 3rd spirit spring thing you might need the earring as it swam straight past my normal hook ( go to the left when you go in and fish at the top of the little ramp )<br>
reekfish are in the zoras river if i can remember<br>
the CAVE OF ORDEALS is in the gerudo desert there 50 floors do all 50 and great faires will be released into all the springs if you get through 10 floors you get fairies in the first spring and every ten you get them released into different springs you ned the spinning top the hookshot, the flail ( ball and chain ) i also recommend the best bomb bags and the quivers as it is very very usefull as you cna kill things from the begining of the floors, to get into the cave of ordeals you must first warp a big bridge from the sand and it will leave a hole which leads into the cave of ordeals ( also if its any help in about floor 43 you have to fight two knights which are very annoying so stock up on fairie tears <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smiley1bce.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> )</p>
<p>thats all i know its long and not very well puncutalitied( or whatever ) and probably not spelt very good i can spell just choose not to <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
