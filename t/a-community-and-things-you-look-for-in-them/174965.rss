    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-community-and-things-you-look-for-in-them/174965</link>
    <description>Well i am starting a community at [cant advertise but its in my sig] and am wondering how I can get a community going. I have alot of builders like graphics sections, a large arcade of 194 games, a soon to be chat box, and a ok marble skin. But I know theres more to a community then what it seems. I join communities that are large and that fit in with my interests. But I need to know what your opinion is.

Please help me out xD,
John

Also I don&#39;t think this is the right place to post o.o</description>

Never require people to be logged in to view the Forums, this almost instantly makes the members think that the Forum is in-active.</p>
