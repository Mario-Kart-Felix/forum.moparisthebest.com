    <title>Need a coder PI</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-coder-pi/506811</link>
    <description>Hey so i&#39;m starting up a server and want to have it running in two weeks. I can code very basic things and only with using tuts. I&#39;m gonna manage the server while someone else codes it. Since you will be doing more work (Coding), you will get more of the income. 60/40 you get 60. 
After vps and website is paid for ofc. Anyone interested?</description>
