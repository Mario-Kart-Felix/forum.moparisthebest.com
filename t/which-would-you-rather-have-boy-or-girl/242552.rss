    <title>Which would you rather have - Boy or Girl</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-would-you-rather-have-boy-or-girl/242552</link>
    <description>I personally would rather have a boy. All kids are a*ses at young ages, but girls are just, ugh. I have a little sister, and dayumm , I would not want to have one. When they&#39;re young they cry all the time, then comes their period, then they come home every day crying. Us guys just sit on our computers all day and go on MITB. So yeah, also post why you picked your choice.</description>

              <p>I’d have to choose both, honestly.</p>
<p>A boy for the fact that with him you don’t have to watch your ass as much as you do with a girl, meaning you can be a bit more free with your words and such as he grows older, also just hand him an Xbox, a 360 or PS3, some games, a PC, food, drink and weed and you could leave for months on end.</p>
<p>A girl because I know for a fact right now my girlfriend wants one, that’s all she fucking talks about, not my personal choice though.</p>

Currently I wouldn’t want to raise a child in this fucked up world. We are expected to run out of many minerals such as iron and zinc by around 2020-2030, and fresh water could be a problem within the next 50 or so years, so I’d rather wait and see if Obama or the next couple presidencies can fix this mess up.<br>

<p>Isn’t iron like one of the most common elements…[/quote]<br>
yeah, most suns contain iron as a ‘fuel’ to burn. When the sun burns iron because hydrogen and helium ran out, it becomes a red giant…</p>
<p>but yeah, i don’t think iron is gonna run out…</p>

<p>Only reason I want a girl is because I never had a sister, and when my neice comes over or my cousins it’s always an interesting time. I’d like to see the whole process of them growing up at home I guess. Only problem with having a daughter over a son is that you have to worry about ALL the penis’, not just one.</p>
<p>And I want a boy so I can do guy stuff with him I guess. I’d like to think that I will be a pretty cool dad lol, and very liberal about stuff too.</p>
