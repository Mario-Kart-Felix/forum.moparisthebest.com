    <description>Hi all, I joined rsps communities a little over 2 weeks ago in the hopes to learn about rsps&#39;s and gain some experience to start a project from an empty but clean base. I know a bit bout Java and have the knowledge to take it far. As for Rsps&#39;s, I am a noob, so this will be an enjoyable learning experience for me.

I want to know what you all think is a strong, clean &amp; empty framework to start with. I also want to know what you think a good client base to use with my source is. Currently I would like to use a 474 revision. I like everything about rs up to the release of the Godwars Dungeon.

I&#39;ve worked mostly with PI and have found it to be very clustered and buggy. So please try to refrain from suggesting it.

So let me know! What should I begin with??</description>

<p>Idk I would say rs2server(474) maybe. Delta++ and convert it over to a pi client or something. I would recommend to just stay away from pi the best you can.</p>

<p>he said no pi, and delta is just as bad, despite the millions of "delta cleaned’</p>
<p>But yes, get Rs2 Server. It’s based off hyperion, which is <span class="bbcode-b">one</span> of the best programmed sources yet</p>
<p>edit: just realized how much jummpyyy made rs2 server seem like a pi  :palm:</p>
