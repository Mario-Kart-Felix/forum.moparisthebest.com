    <title>What game is this?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-game-is-this/368846</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been searching for a while for a game I can&#39;t remember the title of. The main problem is that there&#39;s only one part that I remember, but it sounds interesting enough to play the game again.

All I can remember is that a character, probably an enemy, turns out to be a computer. One that works with punch cards. It&#39;s situated in the attic of a house. IIRC, you work together with a female character. Heck, it might have been a movie, although I doubt it.</description>
