              <p>Featuring our innovative new browser-based technology and with big investments in graphics and gameplay, RuneScape is set to take a monumental leap forward in 2013. Higher visual and audio fidelity, improved camera mechanics and a much more customisable interface system are but a taste of what you can expect.</p>
<p>And there, comes oldschool options</p>

              <p>The player owned ports really does sound great. However, they didn’t really go into any amount of detail which has left my mind wandering to idiotic conclusions about how far they’re going to take it. I’m not much of a fan of the leveling up weapons though, they’re veering too far away from RuneScape and becoming more of a generic MMORPG. Not to say some won’t like it, but it’s just not for me.</p>

<p>No clue. I’m out of most of the gossip loop these days. If you want to get any hints, join chats like mod mark’s or mod mmg’s. RS Wikia usually has a bunch of tidbits they gather from jmods too, but the regulars in those channels will know more.</p>

<p>You are not allowed to say that. We all know that Jagex should revert the game back to 2006.</p>
<p>Something on the list sounds really good, I might begin to play the game again.</p>

I hope that they are talking about finishing the elf series too, Priffindinas (or however you spell it), has been un-used for much too long!<br>

<p>From what I have heard from rumors around RuneScape, they are supposed to be finishing that quite soon. With the release of a new Grand Exchange.[/quote]Nah, that was just RuneShark saying what he <span class="bbcode-b">wanted</span> to see. I also saw that video. He said it would be nice if it was used as like a members version of Varrock, I dont think Jagex said anything about it though (GE-wise), but it does sound like they might be finishing up this area, we just don’t have any source for it besides this BTS.</p>

              <p>Really excited for a new RuneScape, unlike most veterans.<br>
If course, I miss the 2006-2008 RuneScape as much as the next guy, but <span class="bbcode-i">COME ON</span>, TWO new skills? P-O-P? New grandmaster quests? This will almost be as good as…well…I feel this will be the best update yet.<br>
Also, that quest with the varrock dog was a twist, wasn’t expecting that. Though I am glad they are putting that poor dog to some use. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
