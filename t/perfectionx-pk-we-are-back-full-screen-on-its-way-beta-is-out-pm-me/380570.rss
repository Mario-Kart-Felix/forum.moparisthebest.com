Hello everyone, my name is Prototype. I would like to bring forward to the community a new RSPS, PerfectionX. As you can tell by the title we are aiming for this server to be perfect. Originally PerfectionX, was not going to be released. This was as it was a project for me to learn from, but it is turning and &#39;perfectly&#39;. I have managed to obtain a hoster, so at the movement the beta&#39;s going to be released next week. Hopefully, the full server would be released a few days before Christmas. We are going to make it Christmas related for December but then we are going to start on the hard stuff.
Quote
By hard stuff I mean:
Summoning
construction
Dungeenering
hunter
full screen
all bosses
