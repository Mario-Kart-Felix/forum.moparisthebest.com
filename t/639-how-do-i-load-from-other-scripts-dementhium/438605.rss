    <title>[639] How do i load from other scripts? [Dementhium]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/639-how-do-i-load-from-other-scripts-dementhium/438605</link>
    <description>Hello, i&#39;m attempting to make Crystal Chest work on my server, i just cannot seem to find out how to (After deleting item 989, which is the crystal key, after being used on the chest) to begin loading the random item thing... hense the CrystalChest.java terms.

I&#39;ve implementing
[code]import org.dementhium.content.minigames.CrystalChest;[/code]

The command i am using to load the CRYSTAL_CHEST_REWARDS is as follows:
[code]player.getInventory().addItem(new ChanceItem(CRYSTAL_CHEST_REWARDS));[/code]

but it states it&#39;s wrong...

Basically i&#39;m asking if anybody knows what i am suppose to set so it can begin doing what is in CrystalChest.java...

I most likely asked the question very awkwardly and probably seem all over the place... Just really need this fixed ;\

Thank you for your attention.</description>
