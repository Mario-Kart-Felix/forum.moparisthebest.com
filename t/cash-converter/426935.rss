    <title>Cash Converter!</title>

    <description>Okay, I found &quot;Mr Mopar&quot; tokkul to cash converter. Then I thought to make it so it&#39;s just cw ticket converter. Well to speed it up I noticed that if you don&#39;t have the correct amount of tickets in your inventory you can still convert with out the right amount.

Is there any way to make it so you HAVE to have the right amount of the the item or the command will not work. I have the code I used and if someone can modify it for me to make it like that that I would be so thankful!

[code]
if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;t2g1&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 0) {
if(playerHasItem(4067, 1))
deleteItem(4067, 1);
addItem(995, 100000000);
sM(&quot;You have chose to convert to gold.&quot;);
}
if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;g2t1&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 0) {
if(playerHasItem(4067, 1))
deleteItem(995, 100000000);
addItem(4067, 1);
sM(&quot;You have chose to convert to tickets.&quot;);
}[/code]

Anyone have any codes to add to this one?</description>
