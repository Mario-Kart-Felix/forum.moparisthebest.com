    <description>I tried the bank5 and stuff nothing is working bank5 seems to control all of the buy options but nothing is working please help..

I am coming here cause I can&#39;t for the life of me find where I can change the buy 1 buy 5 buy 10 buy 100 when I click and buy they always buy one where do I look into changing this?

Update:
I have then but nothing seems to work I will check them again I guess and what about wild where I look to change wild places to safe? Note: I changed the stuff in bank5 and bank10 and nothing works I am using factor-zeros source and client.</description>

              <p>Yeah he just told you, the “bank5” “bank10” etc. and if you don’t have these packets then just rip them from another source assuming you don’t know how to code them yourself.</p>
