    <title>Where to go with server development?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-to-go-with-server-development/477797</link>
    <description>So, we all know what&#39;s happening right about now. There&#39;s loads of 06-10 remakes coming out, along with those 700+ servers. I still like the 317 era, imo it&#39;s really easy to work with.

But where do we go with it? Do we make a custom game, like Lare(Clawz Fury) and Asshole_rule is, do we try more remakes, or do we throw a bunch of custom shit in it?

I was thinking of making a server (it&#39;ll be a bitch) with 3 worlds.
1) being a remake (around the 08 era)
2) A community based pk-server. Community-based meaning, we(assuming I get a team) will receive input from our users (Like RuneScape did with bringing the wildy back), and add content that way.
3) A unique content-based server. It wouldn&#39;t just have 1 unique idea, but many. Integrating them all together would be rather hard if not done right, but it is indeed possible.

Your opinions?
[I&#39;m willing to start a team to work on this. Message me about it, we&#39;ll be using the Project Skibblez thread, as I&#39;m still doing my remake server either way.]</description>
