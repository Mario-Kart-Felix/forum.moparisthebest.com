<p>other life forms do exist, well if we exist in this universe there is 99% chance there is life in this universe somewhere but we haven’t found it yet, meaning other life i didn’t mean those stupid tv aliens they could be micro organism, or a race that is superior to us after years of evolvation maybe a life forms that is below our intelligent. by the way who said you need water to survive, well maybe for us in earth we need water to survive, as time goes we are finding new chemicals and gases, what if there is a form of life that can live off diffrent type of elements which are unknown to us or which are deadly to us.</p>
<p>also the big bag the creation of the universe, before the big bang space didn’t exist for that time didn’t exist so nothing existed. but after the big bang which grew in seconds which happened billilons of years ago do u think we are the only form of life that’s been created???. ex. what about the dinosors how were they created ( where were they created from ??). as that life could of been created in many galaxies why even in ours, till we search we never know.</p>
<p>once a great idot said “aliens do exist, beacuse no one hath proved they don’t”. (sorry mind my spelling errors (not a good student of the english language)</p>

              <p>I believe that there is. There have been many discoveries that can hint towards this, such as the discovery of Gliese 581, it’s 20 light years from the earth, 1/3 the size of the son and 50x colder than it. It has the same atmospheric make up as earth, not to mention the stars around it that provide it with enough heat that the planet has H20. If there are things like this, there must be other life forms. Not just aliens, there are more forms of life then that, such as bacteria. With H20, comes bacteria. If Gliese 581 can have H20, then there is a 90% chance it is a place possible to be lived on. I’m sure earth was once the same way, before the big bang. The bacteria came on the water, evolution took place (evolution is not the changing over time, it’s the survival of the fittest), and civilization eventually grew. At one point or another, scientists plan to have a space elevator, and possible people living on mars. If all of this is possible, then what do you think the chances are of other life, and remember people. There are more forms of life then just aliens. Think micro-organisms.</p>
<p>*for those of you who don’t believe me, here is a DIRECT link to an article about Gliese 581<br>

Moons are not considered planets since they orbit around a defined object which orbits around a star, instead of just a star. O.o[/quote]<br>
i think he just ment life forms out there in general, like not on earth.</p>
<p>[quote=“lawl, post:1, topic:105477”]i cant say if there are or not</p>
<p>what i hate is when people think aliens are going to be similar to us</p>
<p>after billions of years of evolution, the chances of aliens being similar to us in any way are too minuscule to consider[/quote]<br>
This is the point i have always tried to make, a few years back me and a friend got into an argument about Pluto, she said there was no way life could ever be on Pluto, its to cold and there is no oxygen, my argument was that it would not be like any life form that we know of. Well i doubt there is life on Pluto, it was just a point i was trying to make about how if there was life elsewhere it would be significantly different from what we would call normal…</p>

<p>HAHAHHAHAHA a life form doesnt have AI they have just I<br>

<p>I was wondering the same thing,</p>
<p>But yes I think there are other life forms on other planets, in other galaxies. I mean we’ve seen a few UFO’s (not sure if they are Planes or anythings) . But it might just be a little myth. You know what. I have no idea, My father is pretty interested in these things, (he watches Star Trek Enterprise and shit).</p>
