    <title>Automated motion tracking?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/automated-motion-tracking/456464</link>
    <description>I&#39;m a noob with this stuff, so forgive me if this is obvious/well known.

Is anyone aware of anything I could use to do automated motion tracking? For example, let&#39;s say I want to pixelate a vehicle licence plate - manually moving the mask around with keyframes is a pain in the arse - but the plate is a fairly clear solid yellow block, so surely there must be something that exists that allows the editor to do this automatically?

I&#39;d prefer if it was a solution available for Vegas.

Any help appreciated.</description>
