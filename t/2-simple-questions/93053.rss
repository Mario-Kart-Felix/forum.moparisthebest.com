    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2-simple-questions/93053</link>
    <description>ok 1st question is what are the skills? this is what i hav so far

character-skill = 0	
character-skill = 1		
character-skill = 2	= strength
character-skill = 3	= hp
character-skill = 4	
character-skill = 5		
character-skill = 6	
character-skill = 7	
character-skill = 8	
character-skill = 9		
character-skill = 10		
character-skill = 11		
character-skill = 12		
character-skill = 13		
character-skill = 14		
character-skill = 15		
character-skill = 16		
character-skill = 17	
character-skill = 18		
character-skill = 19	
character-skill = 20		
character-skill = 21	
character-skill = 22		
character-skill = 23	
character-skill = 24

this is NOT coding, this is finding out which skill is which

2nd question is how do u change what an npc says in the world? i am using fr33sc4p3 (downloaded server) and need to know how to change what the npcs say</description>
