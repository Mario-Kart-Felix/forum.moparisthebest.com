    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/website-question/265290</link>
    <description>I&#39;m making my first website and I have a question.

The website is related to Myspace Mobsters, its a App were you grow your mob and fight others.
You can have unlimited mob members and theres sites so you can add people so I was going to make one. Heres my question.

I want to make a add-train were people type in there myspace url and they automatically apear on the addtrain. The add train is where people put there url and there myspace picture will apear on the website and other people will see them and click the picture to add to friends
But I have no idea how to do that</description>
