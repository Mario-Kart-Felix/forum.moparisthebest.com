    <description>RS2 is getting damaged by its own creators, don&#39;t you think?

Personally, I thought it used to be a great game, but now all these messed up updates like the [i]Assist System[/i] and this instant RS k.o. update; Duel Tournament (which I thought would be really cool).

3k per 15 min? No; that is not compatible with me and most other players. 

And now I&#39;ve heard about some new anti-drop trading method Jagex will be adding into the game system. Heard it both from some friends and also saw a thread on this forum about it. Coins will be destroyed when dropped? No way. What if you die and you want to race back to get your money, or if you were training mage with a friend and some how you got owned and he grabbed your runes for you (or maybe for himself). Meh.

I&#39;ll still play RS, but I don&#39;t want to keep seeing all these [i]downgrades[/i].

I&#39;m considering moving more to WoW.

Tell me what your thoughts are about these new &quot;updates&quot;.

~Dizzy

Edit:
I noticed how immature my post was and it&#39;s bad language. So I fixed it up a bit and I would like y&#39;all to know, I still love this game; this is just a debate of whether you think it&#39;s truly being brought down by these updates or not. Sorry.  :o</description>

              <p>I’m guessing this new “anti-drop trading” thing has something to do with the new tombstones coming out.</p>
<p>Also, another rumor is going around about PKing being nerfed (looting removed) and instead you’ll have to play the new Bounty Hunter mini-game to kill AND loot players. If so, I feel like most of my time spent playing the game has been wasted because I’ve been working really hard on a PKER not a damn bounty hunter…</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_competition" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_competition</a></p>
<p>Pure Competition is best for the consumer, and worst for the companies.  As you noted, it’s very easy to buy supplies.  That’s not a good thing.</p>
<blockquote>Perfect competition requires that the following six conditions be fulfilled. In such a market, prices would normally move instantaneously to economic equilibrium.
<p>Atomicity<br>
An atomic market is one in which there are a large number of small producers and consumers on a given market, each so small that its actions have no significant impact on others. Firms are price takers, meaning that the market sets the price that they must choose.</p>
<p>Homogeneity<br>
Goods and services are perfect substitutes; that is, there is no product differentiation. (All firms sell an identical product)<br>
Perfect and complete information<br>
All firms and consumers know the prices set by all firms (see perfect information and complete information).</p>
<p>Equal access<br>
All firms have access to production technologies, and resources are perfectly mobile.</p>
<p>Free entry<br>
Any firm may enter or exit the market as it wishes (see barriers to entry).</p>
<p>Individual buyers and sellers act independently<br>
The market is such that there is no scope for groups of buyers and/or sellers to come together with a view to changing the market price (collusion and cartels are not possible under this market structure)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the basic characteristics of perfect competition.  As you can see, the Grand Exchange makes this approach perfect competition.  We’ll use yew logs as an example here.</p>
<p>No single person has a large share of the market, and thus, individuals cannot influence the price.  Maybe someone sells 10k yew logs all at once, but there are probably millions of yew logs being traded at any one time.</p>
<p>Each product is identical.  A yew log is a yew log.  No brand recognition.</p>
<p>Perfect and complete information.  RS sets the price.  They tell you the market price which you should buy at.</p>
<p>Equal access.  Anyone can get to 60 wc and cut yews at basically any place.  No transportation costs.</p>
<p>Free entry.  If you have 60 wc, you can cut yews whenever you want.</p>
<p>Individual buyers and sellers act independently.  There is no central price setter except for the Grand Exchange itself.  No trusts can be formed.</p>
<p>In pure competition, price of an item equals the marginal cost.  Each item is sold at the lowest people will reasonably sell.  There will always be yew macroers not wanting to wait to sell, so they just offer it at a lower price than the market price to get the cash as fast as they can.  A constant input of these yew macroers will drag down the market price down significantly.</p>

<p>My current thoughts about the GE are fine for now; only because I was able to sell my Guthans for 7.1m in less than 5 seconds.<br>
The only problem with the GE though is attempting to sell logs and various other raw materials. The system is so jam packed with say willow log traders that you have to wait a century long line just to sell a few of your own logs.</p>
<p>I give the GE about a 3/5 for how easy it makes buying my supplies now.</p>

<p>Some people think most RS gp selling sites actually belong to Jagex. It’s a perfect scam, because a lot of people would never know about it since Jagex is all for stopping real world trading.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
There’s also a chance they sell gp themselves to catch and ban traders.</p>

I was going to start playing again before my mock exams next month, just for something to do late at night after revision, but as soon as that Assist system came in, I had second thoughts, and that new dueling rule is the last straw. That was the main reason I wanted to play, and now I can only win 12k an hour, unless I want to go in to some stupid 64 match tourny? Forget it…[/quote] i understand duling, but whats wrong with the assisting thing? sure its free xp, but you have to sit there with the screen on and you can’t do anyhting.</p>
