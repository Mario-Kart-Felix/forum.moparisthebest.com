    <description>I&#39;m looking for the code responsible for moving the camera with your character as he/she walks.

I THINK it is somewhere in here:

[code]public void method57(int i)
    {
        if(i != 18662)
            anInt1263 = encryption.getNextKey();
        int j = anInt901 * 128 + 64;
        int k = anInt902 * 128 + 64;
        int l = method144((byte)-28, plane, j, k) - anInt903;
        if(xCameraPos &lt; j)
        {
            xCameraPos += anInt904 + ((j - xCameraPos) * anInt905) / 1000;
            if(xCameraPos &gt; j)
                xCameraPos = j;
        }
        if(xCameraPos &gt; j)
        {
            xCameraPos -= anInt904 + ((xCameraPos - j) * anInt905) / 1000;
            if(xCameraPos &lt; j)
                xCameraPos = j;
        }
        if(zCameraPos &lt; l)
        {
            zCameraPos += anInt904 + ((l - zCameraPos) * anInt905) / 1000;
            if(zCameraPos &gt; l)
                zCameraPos = l;
        }
        if(zCameraPos &gt; l)
        {
            zCameraPos -= anInt904 + ((zCameraPos - l) * anInt905) / 1000;
            if(zCameraPos &lt; l)
                zCameraPos = l;
        }
        if(yCameraPos &lt; k)
        {
            yCameraPos += anInt904 + ((k - yCameraPos) * anInt905) / 1000;
            if(yCameraPos &gt; k)
                yCameraPos = k;
        }
        if(yCameraPos &gt; k)
        {
            yCameraPos -= anInt904 + ((yCameraPos - k) * anInt905) / 1000;
            if(yCameraPos &lt; k)
                yCameraPos = k;
        }
        j = anInt1150 * 128 + 64;
        k = anInt1151 * 128 + 64;
        l = method144((byte)-28, plane, j, k) - anInt1152;
        int i1 = j - xCameraPos;
        int j1 = l - zCameraPos;
        int k1 = k - yCameraPos;
        int l1 = (int)Math.sqrt(i1 * i1 + k1 * k1);
        int i2 = (int)(Math.atan2(j1, l1) * 325.94900000000001D) &amp; 0x7ff;
        int j2 = (int)(Math.atan2(i1, k1) * -325.94900000000001D) &amp; 0x7ff;
        if(i2 &lt; 128)
            i2 = 128;
        if(i2 &gt; 383)
            i2 = 383;
        if(yCameraCurve &lt; i2)
        {
            yCameraCurve += anInt1153 + ((i2 - yCameraCurve) * anInt1154) / 1000;
            if(yCameraCurve &gt; i2)
                yCameraCurve = i2;
        }
        if(yCameraCurve &gt; i2)
        {
            yCameraCurve -= anInt1153 + ((yCameraCurve - i2) * anInt1154) / 1000;
            if(yCameraCurve &lt; i2)
                yCameraCurve = i2;
        }
        int k2 = j2 - xCameraCurve;
        if(k2 &gt; 1024)
            k2 -= 2048;
        if(k2 &lt; -1024)
            k2 += 2048;
        if(k2 &gt; 0)
        {
            xCameraCurve += anInt1153 + (k2 * anInt1154) / 1000;
            xCameraCurve &amp;= 0x7ff;
        }
        if(k2 &lt; 0)
        {
            xCameraCurve -= anInt1153 + (-k2 * anInt1154) / 1000;
            xCameraCurve &amp;= 0x7ff;
        }
        int l2 = j2 - xCameraCurve;
        if(l2 &gt; 1024)
            l2 -= 2048;
        if(l2 &lt; -1024)
            l2 += 2048;
        if(l2 &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; k2 &gt; 0 || l2 &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; k2 &lt; 0)
            xCameraCurve = j2;
    }[/code]

Any help would be greatly appreciated.</description>

              <p>edit: oh shit i did it again, i managed to fill a whole page with text,<br>
i guess it must be boring to read, but at least try, it does have some good stuff down there…</p>
<p>[quote=“ruler, post:20, topic:209666”]I am talking about the values in a un-modified client, where the client sets the varibles.<br>
changing the value may have many implications.<br>
changeing the varible out of the intened range may yeild incorrect behaviors. Value overflows, rounding errors, etc.[/quote]</p>
<p>that tool isnt about moving it out of bounds, its about controlling each variable <span class="bbcode-i">separately</span>,<br>
think about it logically, you have two directions to go with your keyboard, up-down, and left-right<br>
and you have to control 5 variables with them,<br>
obviously, they are combined,</p>
<p>when you press the up-down buttons, the pitch is <span class="bbcode-u">not</span> the only thing that changes, and Ollie’s diagram seems to show this, but its wrong in that way</p>
<p>i think not many of you have actually tried that camera man app, you probably think “oh I’m high and mighty, i dont need to entertain myself with this nooby activity”<br>
but you should, those pictures i uploaded show nothing compared to what its like, you need to see how the client behaves under those circumstances, otherwise you’ll just screw up in discussions like these,</p>
<p>iv drawn some diagrams for you, to demonstrate how many variable change</p>
<p>this is how ill show the camera, as a kind of torch, the green shaded area is the cone-of-light where it can “see”</p>
<p><img src="http://img208.imageshack.us/img208/331/cameratr2.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>consider this situation:<br>
the first position is when the camera is looking straight at you, like you pressed the “down” button<br>
the second position is when the camera is above you, like you pressed “up”</p>
<p>there are two axis, z and x,</p>
<p>let X1 be the displacement from x axis, or cameraX<br>
let Z1 be the displacement from z axis, or cameraZ<br>
let theta2 be the angle between z-axis and camera, or cameraPitch</p>
<p>iv drawn a little diagram for you of how it changes when you press “up” key</p>
<p><img src="http://img208.imageshack.us/img208/7438/cameramovekq6.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>as you can see, when you press “up”, the cameraX rises so it goes over your player and looks down, its is now X2<br>
the cameraZ rises, so you are looking from higher then your player, its now Z2<br>
the cameraPitch falls, so you look more down, instead of long, its now theta2</p>
<p>you have to separate the variables, you cant just think “oh, pressing up key makes cameraPitch fall”<br>
you cant control 5 variables with 2 controls, the runescape client combines them, and tricks your little mind into thinking its very simple</p>
<p>if you use my program, you’ll see the effect each has, and understand it better,<br>
you can make the pitch higher when you in camera position 2,</p>
<p>and please forget your ridiculous idea of cameraYaw being something to do with the minimap compass angle,</p>
<p>oh by the way, as for the camera variables going out of bounds, thats just for show for those screenshots,<br>
those screenshots really dont make it move, and you cant know what its like just by looking at them,<br>
the real McCoy is when you change one variable at a time, thats the whole point.</p>
<p>as for the rounding errors and overflows, they dont happen if you’re careful<br>
and if they do happen, the game crashes,</p>
<p>the rendering engine in the client is very… emm… whats the word… can take new changes well, i guess <span class="bbcode-i">extensible</span><br>
when you change the values, the client handles it fine,</p>
<p>have you ever played those quests with cutscenes?<br>
dont they zoom in and out, how else do they do that without making the variables go “out of bounds”</p>

              <p>I am talking about the values in a un-modified client, where the client sets the varibles.<br>
changing the value may have many implications.<br>
changeing the varible out of the intened range may yeild incorrect behaviors. Value overflows, rounding errors, etc.<br>
Client may have multiple location for the varible, etc.<br>
You have this thing called block client control.</p>

<p>are the ‘camera curves’ the precomputed sine/cosine arrays? i cant possibly think of any other “curve”</p>
<p>yakman alluded to a compass offset, this has existed since rsc, as has the scale and (i forget the third variable involved). i believe ollie mentioned them and explained some in another thread</p>

              <p>why dont you see camera pitch/yaw?<br>
thats obviously what it is,</p>
<p>so according to you, it should be called<br>
Class26.cameraPlayerZIntercept<br>
Class48.trueCompassAngle</p>
<p>when you use my little camera man app to change to change cameraYaw, or “true compass angle”, the minimap compass doesnt actually change, so that variable obviously has nothing to do with the compass<br>
look at <a href="http://img296.imageshack.us/img296/5900/birdseyeov4.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> picture, according the main screen camera, i am facing north, but according to the minimap compass, i am facing west</p>
<p>you cant just call it an angle, because there are many different planes it moves in,<br>
you have to say “the angle in the horizontal plane”,  “the angle in the verticle plane”</p>
<p>also, i had a whole thread filled with camera pitching and yawing, why didnt you bring up this issue there?<br>
i named them that because i believe its a better name then “cameraCurveX/Y”</p>
<p>edit: i dont see roll either, you cant roll the camera as far as i can tell (without messing around a lot), its pitch and yaw only</p>
