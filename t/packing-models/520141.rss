    <description>Hey so I just added the completionist cape to my server [pi]. I added the completionist cape models into the cache located in my C:\Users\Username. I then created a new client for my players to download with the completionist cape ints. The problem is, the other players who play my server can&#39;t get the new cache with the completionist cape models to download. They tried deleting and re-installing the cache but that didn&#39;t change anything. I don&#39;t know how to get their clients to download the new cache with the new models. Any help?</description>
