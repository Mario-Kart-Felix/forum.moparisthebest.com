    <description>Hey I have a question and it&#39;s about adding models to my client. In my old versions of my client I used to add the gzips and it worked. Now I have added preloading models. I am going to release a new version of my client but how can I hide the models (I don&#39;t want people taking them). Is there a way to pack models into the cache without gzipping them? Is there a way to do this? Thanks,
