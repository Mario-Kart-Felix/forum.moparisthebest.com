    <title>[Movie] The Hills have Eyes [R18]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/movie-the-hills-have-eyes-r18/1960</link>
    <description>This movie is Rated R18 and is supposed to be scary, was it even scary?

Information: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0454841/


EDIT: This was posted by a reviewer on the movie:

I haven&#39;t seen the original, but I now want to because this movie rocked. The movie starts as a slow-boil suspense/horror movie, provides some decent jump-scares (at least in the theater) and spends some time building up character. The movie then switches gears and turns into a gritty, brutal horror movie more the likes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and further switches to gears to a action/revenge movie, but still with horror elements. It&#39;s scary, sick, nearly uncompromising (the unrated cut will undoubtedly be so) and disturbing, but also adrenaline-filled and riveting. Certainly NOT for the weak-stomached person. People were leaving the theater, and the IMDb boards are rife with people damning the movie for it&#39;s &#39;lack of moral substance&#39; and &#39;taste&#39;. This movie isn&#39;t for the average movie-goer. It&#39;s for the horror buffs. Alexendre Aja should be proud, and is 2-for-2 in my book having done this and High Tension.</description>

<p>Why can't movies be good like they were in the 70s? WHY IS EVERYONE REMAKING OLD MOVIES!!! Friggen people remade House of Wax, the Omen (coming soon), War of the Worlds, Pink Panther, Bourne Identity, Parent Trap, and now THE FUCKING HILLS HAVE EYES... grrrr....</p>

<p>It's funny how when they make remakes, people are so amazed, they're like woah look at the pictures and graphics.. even though the movies suck. If they remake Star Wars episodes 4, 5, and 6. I will personally shoot the director. GRAAaahh lol man it pisses me off. <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png?v=3" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
