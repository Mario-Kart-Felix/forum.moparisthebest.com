    <description>Charriot Scape will be a new Server with awsome &amp; unique features. I cannot do all this work by myself, so I am asking some of the best in this community to come forward and help out.  We will be developing: new items, new interfaces, a webclient, new sprites, and much more.  If we work hard, this could very well be the best sever yet!
