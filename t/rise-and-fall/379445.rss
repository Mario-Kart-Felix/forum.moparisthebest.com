[center][size=14pt]Chapter One
Uprise[/size][/center]

[center]	December 7th, 2007. A day in history I will never forget. A day in which all our freedom was taken.
We were now oppressed people. There was nothing we could do. The government officials had finally
implemented a set of laws that would prevent our freedom. They just wanted to make the country safe.
They wanted a country with a healthy, living, economy. Little did they know they where about to throw
their entire economy right into the pit of hell.
	
	For years now, illegal trades had been involved, which was said to be collapsing the economy. People
from foreign lands would come into the nation and work for hours, even days on end, just to bring back
resources and money to their home country. Our officials disagreed with this. They said the resources are
for our people, not these slaves. So they began to implement a set of laws that would, hopefully, prevent
these actions and keep our economy, and nation, at peace.
	
	At the same time as these immigrants, crime was continuing to increase. People tricking others into
giving them items, or basic sleight of hand tricks, to make the value seem the same as offered, while it
may actually be incredibly lower. The country was in havock. These people, known as &quot;scammers&quot;, were the
other primary targets of this economic establishment about to be made.
	
	In October, government officials had officially decided pricing for every item that flowed through their
economy, legal or not. Every item we owned had a set price. Every person could now be classified by their 
riches. They watched us, to see how we react. Scammers were furious, as now basic villagers could catch the
craftyness the scammers. But while this was a big jump in the decreasing of scammers, it did not affect the
immigrants, and would only be the beginning for the scammers.
	
	North of our civilized area is a land known as the &quot;wilderness&quot;. It used be just like the rest of
Gieilinor: a thriving, upbeat area. But that was long ago, back in the days of the Zamorak and Saradomin.
After an intense arguement which lead to a fight between them, only black sut lay across the ground of the
region, with all of the water replaced with scalding water. Officials had decided to make this land
&quot;law free&quot;. Killing of other people was now freely allowed, and greatly taken advantage of. It was a popular
place, suprisingly. People even made a living off of the items taken from dead bodies they had just slain.
	
	December 7th, 2007. A nation in upset, outcry and pure rage. The money tracking system had been given
limits, meaning that not only did items have an official worth, they could only be exanged for so much or
so little. People who made a living off of merchanting were soon to be broke. But that wasn&#39;t the true issue.
The wilderness, the area that had been law free for so long, was now being enforced as a friendly area, and
killing would be no longer allowed. People dissapeared that day. Over 100,000 people vanished. Some left to
other lands. Some simply killed themself. The land of Gieilinor was in complete chaos. But the goverment
would do nothing.

	They said it was for the best. Removing our freedom to exchange items, and our freedom to cut each other
into little pieces at our risk. The wilderness was claimed to be a high area of &quot;illegal transport&quot;, and must
therefor be made a friendly place. That didn&#39;t the dragons would give you their bones, but all killing of your
own race must be stopped. Every form of high quantity risking or trading between people had been completely
removed.

	The worst part about all of this was that we were powerless. People held riots in towns, yelling and
shouting, hoping someone would listen, hoping things would change. But for the time being, they wouldn&#39;t.
Our economy would be under total control. The nation had gone from a democracy to a dictatorship. Some say
it happened overnight. I, however, disagree. This had been coming together for months, the ultimate scheme
to keep their little nation safe and healthy. But we weren&#39;t healthy. We were in oppression. And we wanted
out of it.[/center]</description>

<p>Yeah, I just skimmed through it. I like your perspective and your writing style. It’s an easy read, and it has nice flow. I would be cautious when referring to the history of RuneScape, unless you <span class="bbcode-i">really</span> know it well. It’s rather complex, as you go back in ages and centuries. Nevertheless though, you have good organization. It’ll be great to read more!</p>
<p>Have you thought about posting this on the RS forums?[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I was going to post it on forums, just testing it for feedback here first.</p>

<p>Wow, not really.<br>
I’ve played rs on and off since 04, but it has never affected my personal life, except spending money on membership.<br>

I believe that should be havoc?
<p>Also, you’re using the past perfect too much, as in…</p>

<p>I believe it would be better if you do…</p>
<blockquote>In October, government officials officially decided pricing for every item that flowed through their

<p>Because the past perfect usually needs two events happening at two different times, as in</p>
<blockquote>You had studied well before moving to New York.</blockquote>
also..
<blockquote>They said the resources [s]are[/s] [b]were[/b] for our people, not these slaves.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Scammers were furious, as now basic villagers could catch the
[b]craftyness[/b] the scammers.</blockquote>
craftiness. Also, I believe you are missing an "of" between "craftiness" and "the scammers"
<blockquote>That didn't the dragons would give you their bones, but all killing of your
own race must be stopped.</blockquote>
I believe you are missing "mean" between "That didn't" and "the dragons"?
<p>You also use the future tense a lot, as in “our economy would be under complete control.”</p>
<p>If I were you, I would start the story using Past Perfect as to give the impression these evens happened in the past, then follow up with past simple.</p>
<p>A few I saw, then again I am a bit groggy so maybe I missed something.</p>

              <p>[center]Ok, So I’ll be updating this topic as I continue to write more. Pretty much a free style of the past 3 years. Post criticism, comments, changes I could make, or just personal opinion. Enjoy.[/center]</p>

<span class="bbcode-b"><br>
[size=24pt]Rise and Fall[/size]</span><br>
[size=18pt]<span class="bbcode-b">A nations struggle to keep fighting</span>[/size][/center]</p>
<p>[center][size=14pt]Chapter One<br>
Uprise[/size][/center]</p>
<p>[center]	December 7th, 2007. A day in history I will never forget. A day in which all our freedom was taken.<br>
We were now oppressed people. There was nothing we could do. The government officials had finally<br>
implemented a set of laws that would prevent our freedom. They just wanted to make the country safe.<br>
They wanted a country with a healthy, living, economy. Little did they know they where about to throw<br>
their entire economy right into the pit of hell.</p>
<pre><code>For years now, illegal trades had been involved, which was said to be collapsing the economy. People
</code></pre>
<p>from foreign lands would come into the nation and work for hours, even days on end, just to bring back<br>
resources and money to their home country. Our officials disagreed with this. They said the resources are<br>
for our people, not these slaves. So they began to implement a set of laws that would, hopefully, prevent<br>
these actions and keep our economy, and nation, at peace.</p>
<pre><code>At the same time as these immigrants, crime was continuing to increase. People tricking others into
</code></pre>
<p>giving them items, or basic sleight of hand tricks, to make the value seem the same as offered, while it<br>
may actually be incredibly lower. The country was in havock. These people, known as “scammers”, were the<br>
other primary targets of this economic establishment about to be made.</p>
<pre><code>In October, government officials had officially decided pricing for every item that flowed through their
</code></pre>
<p>economy, legal or not. Every item we owned had a set price. Every person could now be classified by their<br>
riches. They watched us, to see how we react. Scammers were furious, as now basic villagers could catch the<br>
craftyness the scammers. But while this was a big jump in the decreasing of scammers, it did not affect the<br>
immigrants, and would only be the beginning for the scammers.</p>
<pre><code>North of our civilized area is a land known as the "wilderness". It used be just like the rest of
</code></pre>
<p>Gieilinor: a thriving, upbeat area. But that was long ago, back in the days of the Zamorak and Saradomin.<br>
After an intense arguement which lead to a fight between them, only black sut lay across the ground of the<br>
region, with all of the water replaced with scalding water. Officials had decided to make this land<br>
“law free”. Killing of other people was now freely allowed, and greatly taken advantage of. It was a popular<br>
place, suprisingly. People even made a living off of the items taken from dead bodies they had just slain.</p>
<pre><code>December 7th, 2007. A nation in upset, outcry and pure rage. The money tracking system had been given
</code></pre>
<p>limits, meaning that not only did items have an official worth, they could only be exanged for so much or<br>
so little. People who made a living off of merchanting were soon to be broke. But that wasn’t the true issue.<br>
The wilderness, the area that had been law free for so long, was now being enforced as a friendly area, and<br>
killing would be no longer allowed. People dissapeared that day. Over 100,000 people vanished. Some left to<br>
other lands. Some simply killed themself. The land of Gieilinor was in complete chaos. But the goverment<br>
would do nothing.</p>
<pre><code>They said it was for the best. Removing our freedom to exchange items, and our freedom to cut each other
</code></pre>
<p>into little pieces at our risk. The wilderness was claimed to be a high area of “illegal transport”, and must<br>
therefor be made a friendly place. That didn’t the dragons would give you their bones, but all killing of your<br>
own race must be stopped. Every form of high quantity risking or trading between people had been completely<br>
removed.</p>
<pre><code>The worst part about all of this was that we were powerless. People held riots in towns, yelling and
</code></pre>
<p>shouting, hoping someone would listen, hoping things would change. But for the time being, they wouldn’t.<br>
Our economy would be under total control. The nation had gone from a democracy to a dictatorship. Some say<br>
it happened overnight. I, however, disagree. This had been coming together for months, the ultimate scheme<br>
to keep their little nation safe and healthy. But we weren’t healthy. We were in oppression. And we wanted<br>
out of it.[/center]</p>
