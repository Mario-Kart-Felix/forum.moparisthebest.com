    <title>PI Summoning bug with beaver scroll</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-summoning-bug-with-beaver-scroll/407603</link>
    <description>im working on adding scrolls for summoning, how they work is if you use it on the summoned thing it does its action
im currently working on the beavers, its supposed to give a .05% boost to woodcutting (which works) but if you log out then in the timer resets and you can easily do another boost and it keeps going up... i currently have:
[code]//beaver.
		if(itemId == 12429 &amp;&amp; c.lastsummon == 6808) {
		if (c.playerLevel[8] &gt; (c.getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[8]) * .05)) {
		c.sendMessage(&quot;Your woodcutting has already been boosted!&quot;);
		} else if (System.currentTimeMillis() - c.sDelay &gt;= 300000) {
		c.getItems().deleteItem(12429, 1);
		c.gfx0(247);
		c.playerLevel[8] += (c.getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[8]) * .05);
		if (c.playerLevel[8] &gt; c.getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[8]))
		//c.playerLevel[3] = c.getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[8]);
		c.getPA().refreshSkill(8);
		c.sendMessage(&quot;The beaver adds a 5% boost to your woodcutting!&quot;);
		c.sDelay = System.currentTimeMillis();
		} else {
		c.sendMessage(&quot;Enough time hasn&#39;t passed since you last used this!&quot;);
		}
		}[/code]
i thought that &quot;if (c.playerLevel[8] &gt; (c.getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[8]) * .05)) {
		c.sendMessage(&quot;Your woodcutting has already been boosted!&quot;);&quot;
would help but that just made it say the level was already boosted, so i changed it to &quot;&lt;&quot; but that didnt fix anything
 if anybody could help it would be appreciated</description>

i thought that “if (c.playerLevel[8] &gt; (c.getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[8]) * .05)) {<br>
c.sendMessage(“Your woodcutting has already been boosted!”);”<br>
would help but that just made it say the level was already boosted, so i changed it to “&lt;” but that didnt fix anything<br>
if anybody could help it would be appreciated</p>
