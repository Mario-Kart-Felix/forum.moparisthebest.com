    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/command-codes-dodain/161755</link>
    <description>I&#39;m having trouble making spacific commands. I&#39;d really appreciate it if you guys could help me out here. The following commands are what I need:

~ Admin crown toggle (hide/show) - admin only.
~ An invisable command (turns the player invisable) - admin only.
~ Constant noclip - admin only
~ ::kill [username] - admin only

Thanks guys! Oh, and if it helps, i&#39;m useing dodian as a soruce.

Spacificly, the admin toggle. I was thinking that I could like, change my player rights from in-game. Because player rights 4 is admin without the crown. So, ::hide would turn my player rights to 4, and ::show would turn my player rights to 3. So could someone just turn that into computer junk or something?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 01, 2007, 01:59:45 PM[/size][hr]Please help?</description>
