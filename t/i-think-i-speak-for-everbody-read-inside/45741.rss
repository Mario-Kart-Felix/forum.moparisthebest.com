    <description>I think I speak for everybody when I say I think &quot;can i b adman?&quot; is spam. I think this is unacceptable and should be marked as spam. Mod taharok cleared these forums of spam. Yet we still see &quot;cna I b aidmn?&quot;. 

CM/ Global Mods/ Mopar, We should/are we aloud to report these post.?

Also are we aloud to post these posts as spam?

Also I didn&#39;t see a &quot;Moparscape Statements&quot; Forum so I posted here. Also are we aloud to post these posts as spam?</description>
