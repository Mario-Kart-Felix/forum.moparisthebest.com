    <title>Cache error [HELP]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cache-error-help/518766</link>
    <description>so i decided to change my cache from a 742 to a 752. i have deleted my unpacked archive keys and the packed.mx file.
However when i run it i get this error.

It says im missing opcode 94 witch i have in my itemdefintions. one thing i didnt do was change my itemdefinitions.java or the other definitions partly because i couldnt find them. Does any1 have or know where i could find the required files for the 752 cache, ive looked everywhere and i cant seem to find them, even if i dont need them howshould i got about fixing this?  (i dont see why this was moved, its 100% source related...?)


EDIT: i fixed that issue by simply just adding the opcode that i thought was there but now i get this error:
