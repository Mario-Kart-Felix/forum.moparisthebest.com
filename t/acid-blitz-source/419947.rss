    <description>Eyy guys;D
I saw in megaupload i uploaded acid blitz client, that i did about 2 years ago. I remembered the server and i remembered that i love it&lt;3. Now i cant find any versions of it. It was on my usb drive but i deleted it off the drive because i quit for a year. :/. anyone have the source laying around somewhere? any version of it, does not matter.
Thx Peeps.</description>
