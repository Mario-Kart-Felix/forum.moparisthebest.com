    <description>Wow, the memories!!

I use to own a server for maybe a few months before joining SilabGarza. Probably had about 15-30 people on usually, but my computer couldn&#39;t handle it. This was all back in 2007-2008. I was reminiscing about old RS times and did a quick google search of my old servers name. So crazy thinking back and realizing how big RS has been a part of my life.

Well, guess I&#39;m off again. Just felt like I should send a nice message before leaving :)
Hope you all take care</description>
