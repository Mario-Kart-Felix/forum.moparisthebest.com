[CENTER]Spire 2.0 is an innovative RSPS that strives to create a unique experience. 
We&#39;re confident that players, both casual and seasoned RSPS veterans, will find something new here.

As stated above, Spire offers a unique experience; this experience will be unlocked when you first login. You will be prompted to choose a class.
 ([I]Complete[/I], [I]Partially Complete[/I],[I]Not Started[/I])
[U][B]These Classes Are:[/B][/U]
Tank
Berserker
Rogue
Conjurer
Paladin
Sharpshooter
Priest
Battlemage[/CENTER]


[B][CENTER][U]Class Information[/U][/CENTER][/B]
[B]Tank:[/B] Tanks use shields to stun enemies and protect themselves. While wielding a shield, Tanks have a chance to shield-bash their enemies causing them to be stunned for a certain period of time while reducing the enemy&#39;s stats as well.

[B]Berserker: [/B]Berserkers use heavy weaponry to crush their opponents. Their damage increases as their health decreases. While wielding a 2h Sword, they have a chance to multi-attack their targets.

[B]Rogue:[/B] This class uses stealth, poison, and dexterity to take-down their foes. Wielding a dagger and defender (placeholders for off-hand daggers until they are implemented) gives the Rogues a chance to cause a bleed-effect (certain amount of damage over time) to their target. Rogues also use smoke-bombs which allows them to go invisible for a certain period of time allowing a player to run through aggressive enemies without being seen. If a Rogue attacks an opponent while invisible, the &#39;Ambush&#39; effect comes in to play which un-hides the player and causes extra damage to the opponent.

[B]Conjurer:[/B] This class uses dark arts to summon various beings to aid them and their allies; keep in mind that to call-upon said beings, a Conjurer must have a scroll (there are numerous scrolls which summon different beings) and a certain amount of conjuring energy (Conjuring Energy may be obtained through different actions within game-play).
[B]Paladin: [/B]The Paladin is a Holy melee class that uses divine symbols to take down their foes and aid allies. Paladins also passively regenerate prayer slowly over time. [SPOILER=&quot;Divine Symbols Explanation&quot;][B]Divine Symbols are, well, symbols that reside in your inventory. Each symbol has a different ability that adds a passive effect to your Paladin. These effects can be offensive, defensive, or supportive. [/B][/SPOILER]

[B]Sharpshooter: [/B]Sharpshooters use long ranged weapons. Their weapons have a chance to pierce their target&#39;s defences, which will both bind the target and reduce their stats. This effect does stack. Sharpshooters will also be able to lay down traps that will damage, stun, or bind any hostiles that walks over them.

[B]Priest:[/B] This class will be able to heal their allies and offer stat buffs while in battle. ([I]More information on this class will be coming soon.[/I])

[B]Battlemage:[/B] [B][I]More Information Coming Soon.[/I][/B]


[CENTER][B][I]Note: Chances to shield bash, stun, etc are based on what level tier weapon/shield you are currently wielding. Also, each class gains a certain amount of Hitpoints per Constitution level. Example: Rogues gain less HP while Tanks gain more.
[/I][/B] [I]Lifepoints per Constitution level go by the following: Rogue &amp; Conjurer - 8 Life Points; Tank - 13 Life Points; Paladin - 12 Life Points; Berserker - 11 Life Points; Sharpshooter - 9 Life Points; Priest - 7 Life Points.[/I][/CENTER]



[CENTER][B][U]Faction Details[/U][/B]

This server will have NPC factions which will effect your gameplay. More information on this coming soon.[/CENTER]



[B][U][CENTER]Miscellaneous Information[/CENTER][/U][/B]

[ul][*]There will be custom minigames in the near future. This thread will be updated when there is.
[*]NPCs and Bosses have been re-scripted to act &quot;Smarter&quot;. For instance, certain guards eat at low HP and their dialogue changes based on their current lifepoints.
[*]Most Bugs are currently fixed.

</aside>
<p>I agree with that I  think it is a concept which is starting to emerge in a few projects. Regardless, I haven’t seen a server which is currently running that has something like this. It’s refreshing that people are atleast thinking out of the box rather than some plain old pre-eoc junk that only cares about “cum tew arr servar! 300x EXP en 100% working Donar4$$$”</p>
