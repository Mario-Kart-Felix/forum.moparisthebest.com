    <title>[508] Weapon Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-weapon-help/373032</link>
    <description>I am running a 508 server, mithscape is my base. 

The special attack for weapons such as ; armadyl godsword, sara godsword, bandos godsword, dds, etc only hit players and do no damage too monsters, or atleast to bosses. And when they hit players they don&#39;t hit high. They hit fairly common and high without the special but when I activate it it normally results in a 0. How can I make it where it actually hits the npcs, and does higher damage too players?
If I made this unclear(which I probably did, I&#39;m not good about explaining situations) please tell me so I can make it clearer, I really want to fix this problem.</description>

              <p>first of all, mithscape is not a base, its a source ur base is paldino76 <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>anyway, here you go:</p>
<p>go into: src -&gt; paldino76 -&gt; rs2 -&gt; player -&gt; combat -&gt; playercombat.java</p>
<p>than search for:</p>
<p>if (p.equipment[3] == 11694) { /* Armadyl Godsword */</p>
<p>under that it will say like:</p>
<p>maxHit *= 3.47;</p>
<p>change the 3.47 to another number to increase ur change of hitting, but this will also make you hit higher <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> i would suggest don’t go above 4 because than u’ll hit constant 70’s and higher, if you need more help about ur source i can help you out <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
