              <p>There’s an android client for an RSC private server. There also was a client written for the Xbox 360(pretty sure this was the system) by peterjbornx. But to my knowledge I haven’t seen a rs2 android client.</p>

              <p>Without a doubt and even without research I can easily say No. There is too much code that would need to be re-written along with the fact that the client is not made for the smaller screen size. I assume this <span class="bbcode-i">could</span> work on a tablet but still would require almost an entire re-write of the RS2 code. Simplest solution I could give you is to see if your device can run an debian based linux and play from there. I used my TF101 android tablet running a full 14.04 xUbuntu setup to play several java based games just fine.</p>
