              <p>jagex released an announcement that said they could trace rule abuse through your IP, and could use that information to ban your main account as well as the one that was actually doing the rule breaking…however, i know a few people that have been breaking almost all the rules on their “noob” acc’s, and not any of them has had his or her main banned…personally i think it’s a bluff, but i wouldn’t test them…jagex tends to get pissy</p>

              <p>Bow strings are surely fastest way to make money on a lvl 3 char. And it doesn’t give you ban, if its a good program or script.<br>
U can also pick feathers =) though that takes some time to get rich…</p>
