This will probably mean every infringing site in the world could be subject to the law, all that is needed is that it infringes the rights of any U.S. resident, of which there are plenty. What seems interesting about the law is who will be served with orders once a court has issued the injunction. For domestic registrars, this will obviously be the U.S. based registrar, and as stated above, upon receipt of an order of removal registrars must suspend the operation of the domain and lock it. But what happens if the site was registered abroad? This is where the law has teeth! The orders attack Internet service providers, financial entities and advertisers

Some may not see this as a bad thing, but I am deeply worried for various reasons. Firstly, the U.S. still dominates in the domain name arena, as it has almost 60% of all registrars. But also, I am concerned that what this system is creating is a very powerful large scale content national firewall around the United States. So far, they want to use it against infringement, but once in place, it could be easily used against other websites. What would stop them from issuing an order against WikiLeaks? There is a ton of infringing material there! Imagine if the WikiLeaks site could not be resolved in the U.S., or if WikiLeaks could not collect revenue through donations (for example, I have donated money to WikiLeaks via PayPal). I usually dislike slippery slope arguments, but this is an area where I can see how easily it would be to have nefarious future effects.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Would OpenDNS get around this?
If not would it be possible to build a peer-to-peer DNS resolution system, similar to tor&#39;s .onion domains but without the secrecy.</description>

Very good point. Australia has recently gone through all of this ‘mandatory filtering’ (aka, Great Firewall of Australia, internet censorship, whatever), and it rarely made it into newspapers or TV news stories.</p>
<p>It was essentially online-only until the election actually took place.</p>

              <p>I hope it won’t pass, I’ll write my reps and everything to stop shit like this from going down.  But yes yakman, it would be possible to build a DNS service over anything, it’s really simple stuff.  It could be de-centralized like torrents, or as simple as a server running in a foreign country that would serve you DNS records over an encrypted connection.</p>
