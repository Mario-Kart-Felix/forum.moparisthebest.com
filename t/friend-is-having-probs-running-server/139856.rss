    <title>Friend is having probs running server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/friend-is-having-probs-running-server/139856</link>
    <description>hey, my friend recently downloaded a source, and he&#39;s having problems
Fast Facts -
JDK is downloaded
I gave him perfect Compiler
WinRar Downloaded
He can log into Scape
no-ip is downloaded
He knows/understands how the no-ip works.. ( :confused: )

I think the problem is the part where you go to firewall expetions tab..I tell him and he has Windows XP, but he says his dad deleted Windows Firewall..and I couldn&#39;t find a download link.
any help is appreciated...thanks[br][size=1]Posted on: September 02, 2007, 12:56:32 AM[/size][hr]OMFG NOONE?!</description>
