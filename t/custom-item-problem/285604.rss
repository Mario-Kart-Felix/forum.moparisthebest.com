    <title>Custom item problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/custom-item-problem/285604</link>
    <description>Ok, well in my server I&#39;m working on, I&#39;m trying to add customs but they won&#39;t appear right. I&#39;m sure that they&#39;re in the correct file format (Gzip) and that I&#39;m using the correct ID, just it simply comes up as an entirely different item. (Like an armadyl kite, which comes up as a tree) But I&#39;m guessing that it could be the ints, as I have Tj&#39;s Ice Sword working in my client near-perfectly (the bonuses for it are all 0).
Any help is appreciated :D</description>

              <p>Well I did, and made sure all the bonuses were correct. But i put it in between two other items. I doubt that is the problem, but I’ll try again with it at the very bottom.</p>
<p>EDIT: I found the problem. In the item.cfg document, instead of the tab key being used, there had been 3 spaces. I fixed that and they’re working like they should! Even my own custom is working <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

              <p>the reason the bonuses are all 0 is because you have to add the item server sided…<br>
go into item.cfg, scroll all the way to the bottom, and add another line of code (make sure your line of code has the same item id and name as what your calling the model</p>
