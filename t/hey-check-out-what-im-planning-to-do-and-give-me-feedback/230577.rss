    <title>Hey check out what I&#39;m planning to do, and give me feedback!</title>

    <description>Hey, I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about pking, and I&#39;m sure someone has done this before but I havent seen this on any server...
So I was thinking about how a lot of people use banks while private server pking (maybe thats you, maybe thats not you) either way, people do it, and I&#39;m really tired of people doing this because it takes away the whole point of pking... sorta
So I was conspiring an idea to rid banking in the wilderness... I know it sounds like a shitty idea, but I then thought of making an item that would allow you to use the bank instead, so that way it would slow things down, and make pking more stratigic

So heres what I would do for this (I want you to choose one of these options)
I&#39;ve put pro&#39;s (+) and con&#39;s (-) for each one 
____________________________________________________

#1. 
Pro&#39;s

+I would get rid of banking in the wilderness 
+I would replace this with an object that lets you access a bank
+This object would cost a lot of money
+This object can be obtained through clue scrolls or mini-quests (my server only)
+It would add more strategy to pking

Con&#39;s

-People could keep multiple banking items in their bank so therefore they could store more banks and access them later
-It would give an unfair advantage to rich players
____________________________________________________

#2
Pro&#39;s

+(Everything in option 1)

Con&#39;s

-(Everything in option 1)
-I would try to add a timer for the bank
--I would make the banking item untradeable and unsellable
__________________________________________________

#3

I keep wilderness banking
_________________________________________________

Okay so yeah choose one of these options and then tell me why you chose this or what I could add to it (and why I should add this)
Thanks, 
Mimz (00ryn00)

              <p>I don’t have any idea’s for you at the moment, but i do back your idea of how having a friggin bank booth in the middle of the wildy is retarded. 70% pk sources have that.

<p>It’s the wilderness, hence, wild and not very well populated. So why would a bank be traveling around there, even as an object?

<p>Totally awesome, but still, I was focusing around the imp box in real runescape, only instead of one item, it would be one click and you could do your banking then</p>
