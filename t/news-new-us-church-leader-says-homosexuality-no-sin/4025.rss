    <description>[url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060619/ts_nm/religion_episcopals_bishop_dc]News Source[/url]: New US church leader says homosexuality no sin

Description: WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Newly elected leader of the U.S. Episcopal Church Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori said on Monday she believed homosexuality was no sin and homosexuals were created by God to love people of the same gender.

More power to yeah church leader. Getting tired of so many people defaming homosexuals just because they are different. Why do people hate them so much anyways? They&#39;re just people who like to do 1 particular thing in a different way. If you don&#39;t like them, then you have a problem. They may have been born gay, but no reason to make fun of them. And news flash, you can&#39;t catch &#39;gay&#39; as some call it. It&#39;s not a disease. 

There was a poll 2 months ago or a month ago here about gay rights. Something like 17 people said yeah and 30 people said no because they think they are weird. Dumb reason, but everything wrong normally has a dumb reason. What do you think? 

Edit: If you agree or disagree, please actually say why. It&#39;s annoying when people just say, &quot;I disagree&quot; and then end the post.

<p>One last thing. I appreciate your wisdom on gay people and bible and whatever. Do not say what I should or should not do. If I wanted to do ‘humanitarian work’ which I call ethical, I would do it.

<p>For men thier are two burst of testerone during embroyonic development.  The latter affects the brain.  Thus physical males can be born with female brains if the 2nd fails to occur.  Many reasons can cause, drugs, stress on mother ect.</p>
<p>However females are alwasy born with female brains.</p>
<p>So gay men are naturally occuring.</p>
<p>However then insues the environment, which can greatly affect.  Women not being chased after or being cheated/betrayed on seems to be the biggest reason for becoming lesbians.  Same can occur for males.</p>
<p>This is entriely environmental whether it be random mistakes, drug use or stress during enbryonic development.  Then ensues the social enviroment and experiences.  Their is no gene you can set.</p>
<p>I believe at a level people can control this, they are not trapped in condition.  I find the vocal gay culture to be out of hand.  In florida the themes parks have “gay days” to attract gay tourists.  Never go to the parks during this time, they have sex in public.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thats the reason I oppose it. I dont care if they want to buttfuck in their houses but when you see two men in public kissing, its just wierd. AND they have these “bath houses” and shit. Its just wrong, if they want to be treated like regular citizens than they should act like regular citizens.</p>

<p>Why? Because it’s utter ignorance. Also, the people who are posting this trash are using this topic as a springboard for their own opinions on something totally irrelevant to the topic at hand.</p>
<p>As for the priest: He is a moron.  Why would God destroy Sodom and Gomorah in the old testament for the sole reason of the cities being infested with homosexuals if He had nothing against it?</p>

If adam was the first man on earth, and eve was the first woman on earth (As the bible says) how<br>
the hell did the human race continue? Because adam has sex with eve yada yada yada… they have kids… now how do their kids reproduce<br>
a) they have sex with their brother/sister<br>
b)they have sex with their mother/father<br>
take that christianity and all other religions who use the bible…<br>
also i asked a couple of really holy christian this and they just said some crap about god loving everyone… i hope not to get the same replys…[/quote]<br>
This was before GOD told the human race that incest was wrong… The only rule in the beggining was not to eat from the Tree of Life, then we broke that.</p>
<p>My view on homosexuality. It is a sin but to me all sin is equal. It all seperates us from GOD and I also believe that through Christ all sins will be forgiven. If all sin is equal then homosexuals and us are equal because we all sin. I’m cool with all of the gays and lesbians.</p>
<p>Also I believe that it is a choice to be homosexual or hetrosexual. Why do I think this? Because there was a time in my life when I could have chosen to be either straight or gay and I chose straight.</p>

I hate when the church tries to tell us otherwise. They are normally always behind it because they want to get it into our heads that we are different man, but we aren’t. We’re animals.

<p>A list of animals which have been observed as participating in homosexual relationships (or just sex). These are, of course, not cited, so it’s possible that some don’t belong:<br>

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_displaying_homosexual_behavior" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">List of animals displaying homosexual behavior</a></h3>

<p>For these animals, there is documented evidence of homosexual behavior of one or more of the following kinds: sex, courtship, affection, pair bonding, or parenting, as noted in researcher and author Bruce Bagemihl's 1999 book Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity.
 Bagemihl writes that the presence of same-sex sexual behavior was not "officially" observed on a large scale until the 1990s due to possible observer bias caused by social attitudes towards nonheterosexual p...</p>

<p>A citation on Wikipedia which I’m currently trying to get ahold of, which documents female masturbation “involving primarily direct stimulation of the clitoris,” an organ which has only a primary function of <span class="bbcode-b">pleasure</span>: Bruce Bagemihl: Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity. St. Martin’s Press, 1999.</p>
<p>However, I’ve found a number of reviews via google:<br>

<a href="http://www.subversions.com/french/pages/science/animals.html" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.subversions.com/french/pages/science/animals.html</a></p>
<p>Most notably:<br>
<a href="http://www.salon.com/it/feature/1999/03/cov_15featurea.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.salon.com/it/feature/1999/03/cov_15featurea.html</a> which makes note of the description of the clitoral stimulation, of particular interest to us here.</p>
<p>In interest of space, here’s the first page of google, peruse the rest yourself at your leisure: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Bruce+Bagemihl&amp;start=0" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.google.com/search?q=Bruce+Bagemihl&amp;start=0</a></p>
<p>A further list of reviews; I didn’t read anything from here, you may want to:<br>
<a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/search?tb=art&amp;qt=%22Bruce+Bagemihl%22" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.findarticles.com/p/search?tb=art&amp;qt=“Bruce+Bagemihl”</a></p>
<p>As I continue to go through Google, I can’t find anyone attempting to refute his claims. Maybe I missed something. Feel free to look.</p>
<p>This is all from a single page on Wikipedia that took me roughly 15 seconds to find, probably another 10 minutes to read. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_sexuality" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_sexuality</a></p>
<p>Maybe Wikipedia is edited entirely by people who are inherently biased and want to demonstrate that animals aren’t just machines which hump to reproduce and nothing more.</p>
<p>But, let’s make a quick note: originally, you offer dolphins as being the only other animal to enjoy sex. Then, you implicitly have to expand this to bonobos, as whatever little trivia site you’ve quoted includes them; you don’t directly acknowledge that, but in good faith, you probably just didn’t think it was necessary. Okay, so some female animals masturbate in a way that could only be linked to pleasure. Well, maybe there are just a few more than you weren’t aware of. Alright, a couple of animals happen to have sex with their own gender, or even form entirely non-productive sexual pairs and yet hump like mad anyway. That’s still just a handful more to add to the list…</p>
<p>See the trend here?</p>
<p>Vast generalizations, or tiny overdeterminations, tend not to be a good idea.[/quote]<br>

Animals in captivity frequently resort to male-male and female-female pairs: <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0C1EF83A5F0C748CDDAB0894DC404482" rel="nofollow noopener">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0C1EF83A5F0C748CDDAB0894DC404482</a> – For your convenience: <a href="http://www.bugmenot.com/view/www.nytimes.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.bugmenot.com/view/www.nytimes.com</a> – However, I can’t get in to <a href="http://nytimes.com" rel="nofollow noopener">nytimes.com</a> at the moment due to site issues, so I haven’t verified this one myself – These gay pairs also occur in the wild; see the article from <a href="http://sfgate.com" rel="nofollow noopener">sfgate.com</a> above.</p>
<p>A list of animals which have been observed as participating in homosexual relationships (or just sex). These are, of course, not cited, so it’s possible that some don’t belong:<br>

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_displaying_homosexual_behavior" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">List of animals displaying homosexual behavior</a></h3>

<p>For these animals, there is documented evidence of homosexual behavior of one or more of the following kinds: sex, courtship, affection, pair bonding, or parenting, as noted in researcher and author Bruce Bagemihl's 1999 book Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity.
 Bagemihl writes that the presence of same-sex sexual behavior was not "officially" observed on a large scale until the 1990s due to possible observer bias caused by social attitudes towards nonheterosexual p...</p>

<p>A citation on Wikipedia which I’m currently trying to get ahold of, which documents female masturbation “involving primarily direct stimulation of the clitoris,” an organ which has only a primary function of <span class="bbcode-b">pleasure</span>: Bruce Bagemihl: Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity. St. Martin’s Press, 1999.</p>
<p>However, I’ve found a number of reviews via google:<br>

<p>Most notably:<br>
<a href="http://www.salon.com/it/feature/1999/03/cov_15featurea.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.salon.com/it/feature/1999/03/cov_15featurea.html</a> which makes note of the description of the clitoral stimulation, of particular interest to us here.</p>
<p>In interest of space, here’s the first page of google, peruse the rest yourself at your leisure: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Bruce+Bagemihl&amp;start=0" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.google.com/search?q=Bruce+Bagemihl&amp;start=0</a></p>
<p>A further list of reviews; I didn’t read anything from here, you may want to:<br>
<a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/search?tb=art&amp;qt=%22Bruce+Bagemihl%22" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.findarticles.com/p/search?tb=art&amp;qt=“Bruce+Bagemihl”</a></p>
<p>As I continue to go through Google, I can’t find anyone attempting to refute his claims. Maybe I missed something. Feel free to look.</p>
<p>This is all from a single page on Wikipedia that took me roughly 15 seconds to find, probably another 10 minutes to read. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_sexuality" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_sexuality</a></p>
<p>Maybe Wikipedia is edited entirely by people who are inherently biased and want to demonstrate that animals aren’t just machines which hump to reproduce and nothing more.</p>
<p>But, let’s make a quick note: originally, you offer dolphins as being the only other animal to enjoy sex. Then, you implicitly have to expand this to bonobos, as whatever little trivia site you’ve quoted includes them; you don’t directly acknowledge that, but in good faith, you probably just didn’t think it was necessary. Okay, so some female animals masturbate in a way that could only be linked to pleasure. Well, maybe there are just a few more than you weren’t aware of. Alright, a couple of animals happen to have sex with their own gender, or even form entirely non-productive sexual pairs and yet hump like mad anyway. That’s still just a handful more to add to the list…</p>
<p>See the trend here?</p>
<p>Vast generalizations, or tiny overdeterminations, tend not to be a good idea.</p>

you missed the point, i said all other animals never have SEX for pleasure i never said anything about masturbating…[/quote]<br>
I never said you said anything about mastuerbating. philodespotos qoted you saying something about masturbatory activity though. Just think about it. If you have sex and you like it, you look at your dog (if nudered) humping your couch or one of your family members, then that dog enjoys sex. Common sense. Flys like to fuck, I see them all the time outside my house. HOW CAN YOU SAY RABBITS DON’T LIKE TO FUCK!</p>
