[b][u]Python Server Integration[/u][/b]
I&#39;m problay going to host this server, and when I do I want to make it as easy as possible for me. I wrote my own Python program, and named it &quot;Account Generator&quot;. Now, what this program does, is when the player boots up the application, they have 3 options. (1) Signup, (2) Login, and (3) Exit. When signing up, players must use there desired username that they would like for the server aswell as the forums. After the player signup, they than will be directed back to the main title screen where they will be asked to login. Once they login, the client will boot-up (which is .jar&#39;d) and connect to my IP address. Now, this is not the only function of the program. The program is very user-friendly, and offers a wide variety of useful programs that the user may, well, use. Some of these files include; Calculator, Notepad, Paint, Skill guides, and other things.
Below, you will find a list of some finished, working-on, and no started yet features I&#39;m working on building into the program:
[list]
[li]User Friendly Programs/Useful programs, 15+.[/li]
[li]Program starts client when the user logs-in.[/li]
[li]Program saved 2-character text files; one in my characters file, one for the player to manage.[/li]
[li]Saves and registers the user on the forums, and updates on highscores, every time they raise a skill.[/li][/list]

[li]World Messenger.[/li]
[li]Music Player.[/li]
[li]On Screen Video Recorder.[/li]
[li]On Screen Capture Program.[/li][/list]
All of the programs are pretty self-explanatory, and don&#39;t really need further explanation, rather than the fact they are all separate programs, and are not all built into one.

[b][u]Update Log.[/u][/b]
I&#39;m usually on the computer working on the server (due to the fact that I have the flu :fp:), so whenever I edit something into the server, or add some more features onto one of my programs, the information will be posted in the box below.

[code]Updates coming soon![/code]

[b][u]FAQ[/u][/b]

[b]Will this server will be hosted, or released?[/b]
I&#39;m planning on hosting the server. If I get enough players dedicated players, or the opposite and don&#39;t get enough players, than I will have no problems with releasing the server.

[b]You have created a few project now, none have made it past the development. Explain please?[/b]
This is somewhat true. I previously released a Inception Framework for the #317 protocol, and even though it was somewhat shitty, it&#39;s a release. I also worked on a Project Insanity server, which I had accidently gotten rid of. And my most recent project, which was a Hyperion #474, was sold to some kid who bought if for $150.00. This server, however, will be completed and that I assure.

[b]Will you be starting a development team. If yes, could I join?[/b]
If you would like to be apart of the development, please add my MSN. Drew1sgod@hotmail.com . I will not be accepting anyone who wants to code the server, however, if anyone wants to set up the forums I will agree to give said person, 5% of all donations, and administrator in-game. Like I said, add my MSN and we will work something out.

[b]What is the main goal of the server?[/b]
I want this to be a 500+ server, than loads character files, npc&#39;s, objects, item prices, basically all configuration files through a program written in either C# or Python, to make the server run a little smoother and have a smaller disk space.
