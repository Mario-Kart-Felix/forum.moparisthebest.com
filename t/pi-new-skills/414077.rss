    <title>[PI] New skills</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-new-skills/414077</link>
    <description>Ok, I&#39;ve spent a lot of time reading about java and all that good stuff, and I have decided that my first big project that doesn&#39;t just consist of editing and leeching will be that I am going to add a new skill, I have one question to start of with, under the skills tab how do I add a new skill? like make the total level info smaller and add a skill beside it.

Also, if you are very good at java, and don&#39;t mind helping, I will probably have many questions, so if you could PM me so we can stay and touch and I can get answers to questions that Google can&#39;t answer for me, and so I won&#39;t make people mad with spamming all my questions on the forums:)</description>

<p>You’d have to change the sidebar Interface, which is pretty tough.  You’d maybe have to rewrite it all?  InsidiaX has another skill added, look at the code he used for the skills.</p>
