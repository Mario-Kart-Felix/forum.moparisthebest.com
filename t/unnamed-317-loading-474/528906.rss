    <title>Unnamed 317 loading 474</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unnamed-317-loading-474/528906</link>
    <description>[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b]

Hello all, most of you already know me. I am Loveandpower. It&#39;s time for me to start another project and Int Bauk gave me some inspiration that PI can have actual improvements(this isn&#39;t to say that these improvements actually make it any better than any other). I am still in early stages so this thread will be updated later on. 

[b][u]About Myself[/u][/b]

I have been programming since around July 2010. I feel like I have learned a lot about Java in this time and that I need to test and challenge my skills to push myself even further than I have before in the past. I am still not a java &quot;pro&quot; by any means, but I do know more than the general first time beginner as well. 

[b][u]So, what are my plans exactly?[/u][/b]

As the title says this will be a 317 loading 474. I most likely will not hardcode stuff in so that leaves out customs and etc. (even though I do love them haha). I have always been more of a skiller and an economy person. I believe these will be the two main items I shall be working on at first. All combat systems I would like to give 100% credit to Int Bauk as he has done quite a dandy job on it already. 

Just like in a professional team though, I am more than open to listen to any feedback and ideas on how the project can further itself and how the project could have new  content added. While I have nothing wrong with remakes, this will not be one. 

As far as &quot;will this be a hosted projected?&quot; Honestly...I&#39;m not sure. I have ran both successful and non-successful servers. My gut is saying maybe six months down the road it may be an option...but well I just don&#39;t know. I quit my last server cause of all the &quot;server drama&quot; people would make. I just hope my good friend John is prepared to help manage stuff if that day comes again!

[b][u]Update Log[/u][/b]

-None as of yet, as I am still waiting on Int Bauk to get back with me on a few issues from his release that I am not 100% sure on. This will be updated at a later time. 

[b][u]Bugs[/u][/b]

-After every content piece has been added I shall go and test the content further myself. IF the server ever gets to the point of actually hosting it I will hold a very strict and closed alpha/beta for it. 

[b][u]Media[/u][/b]

-I am unable to log in at the moment until Int Bauk gets into contact with me until then here is the image from his download.

[b][u]Ending comments[/u][/b]

Even now I am still kind of unsure as to who I want to be included in this development, and what I am looking for in a programmer/developer. I may consider working with a client developer if he/she can prove themselves actually knowledgeable at what they are doing. I will not accept just anybody. 

[b][u]Credits[/u][/b]

<p>I made a run/compiler batch for that one person. These are errors that I noticed in the compiler itself after I made it. I also posted on the topic that I was waiting for Int Bauk to provide further support as it seemed that certain files were missing.</p>
