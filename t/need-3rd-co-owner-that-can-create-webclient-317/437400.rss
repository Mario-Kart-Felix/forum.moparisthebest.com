    <title>Need 3rd Co-owner ; That Can Create Webclient (317)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-3rd-co-owner-that-can-create-webclient-317/437400</link>
    <description>We have a perfect coded source from runescape in the 2005/2006 days, everything has been pretty much coded from scratch in the past few months with spending atleast 4 hours on the source per day.

The main owner is Dylan, a registered Java Programmer with several years of experience.
The secondary owner is me, a professional website designer, i&#39;ve ran my own web design business for the past 6 years.

We have the two key elements for running a good server, someone that can handle everything server sided related to coding, and someone that can handle everything else (website and other). With atleast 15+ years of combined experience. We thought that when both of us would be busy coding and working to maintain the players and there needs to be someone that can help run and maintain the server while we&#39;re working, someone that gets involved with the players aswell.

There is one main requirement that is needed, you need to be able to create a 317 Webclient pretty swiftly, we&#39;re hoping to release the server tonight or sometime tomorrow. If you know how to create a webclient and are willing to be dedicated and help with this amazing project, please let us know in a comment below. 

Thanks, - EclipseRuins</description>

You clearly have no idea how talented the Higher-up moparians are. MITB has gifted programmers whereas r-s, r-l and other communities have way more members, but way more hideously stupid members. If you are talking about morons, please tell me what makes you different from all of them.<br>
