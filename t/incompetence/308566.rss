    <description>Well, about 2 weeks ago I sent my 22&quot; inch computer monitor to service because it suddenly bursted into flames and started smoking the shit out of my room.

I went to the shop where I bought it and got told that they would have it ready in about 3-5 days.

I wait 2 weeks and I&#39;m getting no calls from the store, so I went over there to rant. 
Those retards had forgot to send it to service. 

I went back in about 4 days and they gave me a new one. I was satisfied. 

When I got home I opened the box, and guess what, no cables.

I went back there, yet again and I got another box which contained the VGA cable and the power cable, this time they had forgot to put in the audio cable.

I was really pissed and went back. After waiting 30 minutes, the retard finally comes out from the back and gives me the cable.

I have another rant now. Last night I finally moved all my shit to my dads, arranged to be picked up by a school friend on the way to school in mornings. He forgets to get me on way. I now have to find a way to get 30km to school up hill on a pushbike.<br>

School actually ended up being quite good once I got a ride from my stepdad. I owned up at pool (snooker, 8-ball, etc) and my tech teacher made me the welding instructor.</p>

              <p>2 weeks ago I was this VGA cable for this 22" computer monitor and then this kid comes up and starts to burn the monitor! Im like wtf! who am I going to give electrons to now! So the kids puts me, audio cable and monitor in a box and takes us to this shop. he goes nutty  and expecting it to be serviced! There’s this guy at the shop who knows it cant be fixed. Me, the audio cable and the box say our goodbyes to the monitor who was being sent away then the dude at the shop throws us under the counter. The kid comes back about two weeks later ranting that he hasn’t had any calls for the monitor, duuhh you fucked it over! The dude at the shop picks me up a new monitor and puts us in the box, he forgets my beloved audio cable! The kid takes me and the new monitor home (we get along well) and plugs me in, he gets pissy because the dude at the shop “forgot” to but audio cable in the box, i didn’t see him for ages, he came back plugged audio cable in and then i get all these electrons saying “hey we are gay scat porn” so I think im going to break my self, I feel sorry for audio cable!</p>

Those retards had forgot to send it to service.</p>
<p>I went back in about 4 days and they gave me a new one. I was satisfied.</p>
<p>When I got home I opened the box, and guess what, no cables.</p>
<p>I went back there, yet again and I got another box which contained the VGA cable and the power cable, this time they had forgot to put in the audio cable.</p>
<p>I was really pissed and went back. After waiting 30 minutes, the retard finally comes out from the back and gives me the cable.</p>
