    <title>Is there anyway to make a place like its snowing?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-there-anyway-to-make-a-place-like-its-snowing/236615</link>
    <description>As what I seen, (by moparscape 3.2 by looking at the .java files) I was going though the commands.
Well, there was one part where it says &quot;snowing = 1&quot; or something like that (could of been snow1 = 1;) 

But anyways, is there an actual way to make it snow? Or an effect (gfx?) to make it look like its snowing by command or just a location? If so, how?
