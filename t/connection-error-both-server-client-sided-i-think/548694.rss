    <title>Connection Error? (Both Server &amp; Client sided I think)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connection-error-both-server-client-sided-i-think/548694</link>
    <description>Okay, So I&#39;m not 100% sure if this is client or server sided. When I have my client&#39;s ip on localhost (127.0.0.1) I connect, and when on my ip it gives the error &quot;Unexpected server response please try using a different world.&quot; 
YES its portforwarded correctly, because I have other servers that run correctly, I&#39;m not sure what the problem is, but server sided it says the account has logged in, but on the client it gives that error, any suggestions?</description>
