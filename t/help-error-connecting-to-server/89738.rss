    <title>Help! &quot;Error Connecting to Server!&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-error-connecting-to-server/89738</link>
    <description>Well I&#39;ve been trying for three days now and this message comes up everytime... 
&quot;Error connecting to server. Must be down. Click &quot;cancle&quot; then &quot;start server&quot; to make your own.&quot; 
I&#39;ve been trying many different ones for a while and I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m doing wrong. I have it downloaded too and the webclient isn&#39;t working. This is my first itme playing. I just type in any name and any password and and a server I found on the list.
If anyone can help that&#39;d be great! 
Thanks!</description>

              <p>This means the server must be down or crashed. If the server has hamachi u need to download it here <a href="http://www.hamachi.cc/download/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.hamachi.cc/download/</a> and download the one that fits ur computer. Also make sure the ip is right, and if the port is not defualt go to the top press file:new port: then enter the port.</p>
<p>U will know if the servers uses hamachi or not because on the server page where its being advertised it will say</p>
<p>Ham or Hamachi- yes or no</p>
<p>if yes the it should say under it<br>
Network- (the name)<br>
Pass- (the pass)</p>
