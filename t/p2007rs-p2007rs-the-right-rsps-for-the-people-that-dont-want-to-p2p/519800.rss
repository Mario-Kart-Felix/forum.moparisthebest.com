[center][size=18pt][b]P2007Rs Information:[/b][/size][/center]

P2007s [b]{ A.k.a Project 2006scape, Project 2006, Project Rs }[/b] is a F2P, non profit rsps, that will never shutdown, but a lot of downtime.
We don&#39;t aim to be the best, but the server for you. With many updates and alot of things being added, we know this server will never have a feeling &quot; i don&#39;t trust this server.&quot; We are proud we are doing this rsps. Were not the ones that accept rsgp donations or paypal and just walk away, were here to stay period. We will not get shutdown even if they make us, we will put up a fight. This is a professional 2007 Remake with 474 gameframe, and will have constant updates. Skills before May 30 2006, The rest is 2007 pure content. We will have Runescape Quests, but they will be custom and shorter, but similar. So please don&#39;t just walk away and say &quot;oh, another fail remake.&quot; because this won&#39;t be a fail this will continue until the day i die, sincerely. This server will be the first of all remakes, that gets out of beta, because all remakes end at Beta...

This is merely a started beta, we been working hard on rewriting a lot of the packets to fit our needs. We are going to start checking every single skills that is on our skills tab. Not all information is accurate but what we viewed. For the music, nobody really listens to it, so we removed it and i forgot how to add it back.

Well i found this on server downloads by someone named ’ carlosathetruth ’ and i basically edited it a little added hyperion game engine and cyclehandler and added alot, but i am basically trying to fix what he added. And right now i am trying to fix some of the skills before starting on tut island again, but truthfully thats why theirs no media right now, i keep finding problems, but they will be up.<br>

<p>Your going to have to fix  a few things in playerassistant before making tutorial island work.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Also I would use a 474 hyperion for a 07 remake due to a PI being 317 protocol ( like 2006)[/quote]</p>
<p>I swear PI is actually 474, which just loads 600+.</p>
