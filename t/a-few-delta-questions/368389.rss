    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-delta-questions/368389</link>
    <description>[color=red][u][b]Hey all.
So,recently, I have decided that i need to know some things.
Please answer these questions if you can,it would be most appreciated.


1. Does anyone have the code for a &#39;kill&#39;command. I want it admin+ and to simply kill the player making them lose all but 3 items ,like what would happen if they died normally.

2. I need a server control panel. I have looked at many tuts on this,but none of them make sense to me. I need to be able 2 send a message(very very important) and also i need to be able to ban,mute,kill,jail, all that kinda stuff.

3. I just made a new co-owner,has anyone got any ideas for any commands.

4. How do i make cutscenes?

I need to make it so you dont get pkpoints when you die,only when you pk someone.[/b][/u][/color]</description>

As far as my 317 knowledge goes, no one has made a cutscene yet. But I’m sure it will happen some day.<br>
If good tuts don’t make sense to you, learn java. If you already “learnt it” which I doubt you did, then read the tutorial thoroughly. Then it will make sense to you.<br>
Dastan_ spoonfeeded you with the kill command. I’ll describe it.</p>
<p><code>
if(command.startsWith("givedeath") &amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt;= 2)) { // if the player is an admin or better, and his/her command is "::givedeath"...
String name = command.substring(10); // create a string called "name" and set it's value to after 10 characters inserted.
try {
int p = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(name); // create an int called p and set it's value to name (name is the string we created).
client c = (client) server.playerHandler.players[p]; // create a client called c and set it's value to p (p is the int we created).
c.deathStage = 1; // set deathstage for c equaled to 1
yell(name+" has been @dre@slayed."); // yell the text
} catch(Exception e) { // Exception e, don't wory about this crap but don't delete it either.
sM(name+" either isn't online or doesn't exist");
} // end the exception e
} // end the command</code><br>

<p>People actually have made cutscenes before, I think the methods for it already exist in client.java, although if I am correct, I forgot what they were.[/quote]Let me see if I can surf around client.java to find some.</p>
