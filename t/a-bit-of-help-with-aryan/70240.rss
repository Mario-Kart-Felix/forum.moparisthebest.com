    <title>A Bit of Help With Aryan</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-bit-of-help-with-aryan/70240</link>
    <description>ok so i have been using moparscape for a while now and have manged to learn a few things about how it works i help out with a server my friend runs and all that but there is one thing that always puzzled me why is aryan in there? i mean most servers have such quick leveling that using aryan is pointless. because of this and the fact that by the time that i personally started to try and cheat on runescape aryan had already died. so i never learned how to use it but now for some reason that little aryan button in the menu bar of moparscape has piqued my intrest. i do not know how to load scripts into the integrated aryan moparscape comes with so i am unable to run any of the ones i have. if anyone would be willing to explain how it works or where i might be able to find a good tutorial it would be much appreciated.

Thank You,

In hind sight it may have been better to post this thread in RS2 Server Development/Help
but since this had a title of aryan private server scripts i figured i may be fairly relevant to what is being disscused here.</description>
