    <title>Cleaning off my computer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cleaning-off-my-computer/365008</link>
    <description>So i have a 450gb HD that is almost completely full. I have a strong urge to wipe it and put a fresh install on it just to get that &#39;new&#39; feeling again. But i have tons of shit on here that i *think* i might need again or want to have in the future so i keep postponing the wipe.

Im going to assume some of you have encountered this problem, whats the best way of doing this? Going through and manually getting rid of stuff you dont need and then backing up and wiping? I was thinking of putting everything into one folder and give myself 30 days to naturally take stuff out of the folder i need, but im still worried i might need something again.

To give an example of how cluttered it is, i have a folder on my desktop that i throw EVERYTHING in that i dont want to delete and that i dont want to leave on my desktop.

Somehow i think wiping it all will benefit me because ill have to create new assets graphics wise, which means ill learn more. dunno, suggestions?

ITS A LAPTOP

              <p><span class="bbcode-s">Buy a new drive (1-2tb’s are piss cheap now) and create one partition for your OS and one for your data (a 20/80% split works well for most). Install the OS on that drive and start copying whatever you need from the old drive to the new data partition. You can even redirect the documents/music/pictures folders of your new OS to the data partition. With this in place, you’ll be able to reinstall your OS as often as you want and never have to worry about losing data. You can use the old drive for backups and whatnot.</span></p>
