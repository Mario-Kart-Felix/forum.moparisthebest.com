    <description>Test:
[ul][li]Parabola (main=org.sirox.graph.test.parabola.Main,applet=org.sirox.graph.test.parabola.Applet)[/li][/ul]

[code]
		double a = 1D;
		double b = 0D;
		double c = -10D;
		graph.setConnectPoints(false);
		graph.setPaused(true);
		for (double x = -4D; x &lt;= 4D; x += 0.001D)
			graph.addCoordinate(new Coordinate(x, a * Math.pow(x, 2D) + b * x + c));

		graph.setPaused(false);
[/code]

Updates:

[ul][li]Cleaned up the API[/li]
[li]Cleaned up setup/change methods[/li]
[li]Added methods for changing the ALL of the settings of the graph.[/li]
[li]Added theme settings[/li]
[li]Fixed graphing coordinate points[/li]
[li]Added a method to pause the buffer repainting system (use for large amounts of points at one time)[/li]
[li]Cleaned up memory destruction[/li]
[li]Added a connect points option[/li][/ul]</description>

wikipedia is pretty secure,</p>
<ol>
<li>many popular pages are locked so only admins can edit them</li>
<li>when a person makes a change for the first time it is automatically flagged for review</li>
<li>it has the same advantages as open source, if someone who knows the topic very well sees an issue in it they can contribute and fix it making it better etc</li>

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_of_Wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Reliability of Wikipedia</a></h3>

<p>
 The reliability of Wikipedia (predominantly of the English-language edition) has been frequently questioned and often assessed. The reliability has been tested statistically, through comparative review, analysis of the historical patterns, and  strengths and weaknesses inherent in the editing process unique to Wikipedia. Incidents of conflicted editing, and the use of Wikipedia for 'revenge editing' (inserting false, defamatory or biased statements into biographies) have attracted publicity.[2</p>

<p>As a summary, you really think that an Encyclopedia written by many people who know what they are talking about is less accurate than one written by just a few people?</p>

<p>You could make the argument that wikipedia staff reads over the edited articles, and will revert to a backup after the edit.  However, wikipedia staff don’t know everything, so if it sounds like it is true than the edit is accepted.</p>
<p>And this, in its entirety, is why Wikipedia simply can’t be trusted as a proper source of information.  I do however admit that wikipedia has its usefulness, but it should hold no weight in an argument.  Actual written, confirmed and uneditable blogs or papers on the matter should be much more preferred.</p>
