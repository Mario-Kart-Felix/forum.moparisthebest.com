    <title>No Players?</title>

    <description>I&#39;m having a problem.
Well, you see, I posted my status on mopar, and I uploaded my client to uppit.
BUT the only problem is, I check on uppit on my download page, i get a lot of downloads like 20. But, the only thing is, People arent even joining! Well, I only get a few people on, Like, i only got like 10 created accs out of 40 downloads. It just doesnt make sense... is there something wrong with my client? Please help ... I&#39;m using Dannyscape V4 Source.
And also another question, if the problem is that 30~ MB is too high to download, Can you guide me on how to make it so more people will download it? THANKS.</description>
