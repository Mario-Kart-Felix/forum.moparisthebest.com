    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/matrix-718-is-there-a-code-that-will-unlock-all-musics-on-matrix-718/519043</link>
    <description>Title says all, i had the code before, but my windows has crashed, and everything was lost, so i&#39;m wondering if someone else has the code.
It was in the MusicsManager.java as far i can remember.</description>
