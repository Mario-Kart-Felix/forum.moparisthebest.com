They put a lot of thought into the quests and the story lines, which is why you should do them. If you’re into the lore of them, you will absolutely love the quests. I am a big fan of the Mahjarrat/God/Dragonkin quest line. If you want to read more about the story lines, you can easily go onto the RuneScape Wikia and read about them.[/quote]</p>
<p>I personally fell in love with cave goblin series. &lt;3<br>
also dwarf is awesome, since they started to write stories on forums. (:<br>
I guess mahjarrat is the longest game quest line? So many branches at least knotted together.</p>
