    <title>Need to talk with an average or better coder</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-to-talk-with-an-average-or-better-coder/361507</link>
    <description>I know a moderate amount of C++ and java. I know a very good amount of blitzbasic but thats a shitty language.

I have too much questions to ask all at once and i learn a lot better when im in a 1:1 conversation.

-----------------------------------------------

Here is just a list of [b]some[/b] of the questions i need answered:

317/508 server architecure
How packets are sent/received
Are handlers good or bad?
mopar history in a far
any servers coded besides java
how objects are used in priv servs

-----------------------------------------------

if someone could either pm me, or email me: [email]lurtz1122334@hotmail.com[/email] or if anyone has skype just pm their info. I highly recommand someone who has skype since i communication is much faster/easier that way.</description>

              <p>and a more specific question. Im trying to enhance woodcutting in a pk planet source that i have. I changed the amount of time it takes u to get logs so now its randomized. However i want to have the trees be able to cut down into stumps after all of its logs r taken. Then after awhile it would be replaced by the reg tree. Would and array be ok for that? it would store the trees total logs,x and y positions and the kind of tree. However where would i put the code to actually loop through all of that? also i know there has to be a better way to do that instead of using just the client.java</p>

<p>One of my big questions is are handlers good or bad? is it better to have 1 huge client.java or many small classes for different purposes?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>In my honest opinion if you want to cram everything into client class go for it, but I personally prefer to have my client class as small as possible and use different classes for other purposes.</p>

              <p>I’ll only answer questions that I understand what you mean.</p>
<p>How packets are sent/received:</p>
<p>When a someone clicks on an item on the ground, it sends a packet to the server to pick it up. I’ll show you an example of picking up an item below:</p>
<p>[code=java]case 236: // or whatever the packet is for picking up items<br>
pItemY = inStream.readSignedWordBigEndian();<br>
pItemId = inStream.readUnsignedWord();<br>
pItemX = inStream.readSignedWordBigEndian();</p>
<p>if (freeSlots() &lt; 1) {<br>
sendMessage(“You have no room in your inventory.”);<br>
break;<br>
}<br>
int itemAmount = ItemHandler.itemAmount(pItemId, pItemX, pItemY);<br>
if (ClickCount &lt;= 2) {<br>
ClickCount += 4;<br>
if(absX == pItemX &amp;&amp; absY == pItemY) {<br>
addItem(pItemId, itemAmount);<br>
ItemHandler.removeItem(pItemId, pItemX, pItemY, itemAmount);	<br>
} else {<br>
walkingToItem = true;<br>
}<br>
}<br>
break;[/code]<br>
(I know my code is a sloppy pile of shit and could probably done more efficiently but you know, I’m to lazy etc).</p>
<p>As for your other question:<br>
I’m not entirely sure, but I think there’s a 508/525 server programmed in C++.</p>
