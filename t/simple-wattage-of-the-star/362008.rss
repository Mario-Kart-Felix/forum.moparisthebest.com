    <description> simple wattage of the star
1. The problem statement, all variables and given/known data
A) How many W does 1 kg of the sun’s interior produce via nuclear reactions, on average? Compare the sun with a carbattery, which typically produces 190 W/kg. Which body wins?

B) Estimating the time the two objects are providing their respective power, compare the energy in kWh that 1kg of the two objects emit over their lifetime (one discharge time in case of the battery). Which object wins thiscompetition?

C) Assuming that the total radiated energy remains the same (it depends on the initial amount of hydrogen that willeventually convert to helium), what would be the main-sequence lifetime of the sun if it produced as much wattageper unit mass as the battery? Would life on Earth exist then? Would life anywhere else in the solar system exist?



2. Relevant equations

not sure

3. The attempt at a solution
for part i A) did solar luminosity/solarmass=0.2millwatt/kg so for 1kg is 0.2milliwatt and for care batt is 190w...so car wins...

for part B) not sure what to do hints would be great.. im not under standing it...

part C) i can do after part B..</description>
