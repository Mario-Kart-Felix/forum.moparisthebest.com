    <title>LEAKED: StorkPk fixed client source. How many people already have it?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/leaked-storkpk-fixed-client-source-how-many-people-already-have-it/243386</link>
    <description>If someone doesn&#39;t know I use the nicks Irc0p, linkin, Bassleader.

Few weeks ago T X gave me the StorkPk client. At first I failed to get it connecting, because Hixk has changed alot on the packets side. Nor did anyone else or T X get it connecting. At last I succeeded. I gave the source to 1 person who forwarded it to 1 more person. And it seems it got bad after this &quot;1 more person&quot;. Yesterday my friend sent me a modified version of my source. It was mine, had my name on it, same files etc. It uses Imk0tters script interface. Right now it seems alot of people have got their hands on it.

Just being curious. Who of you already have it and who did you get it from?

Anyway, my and the person&#39;s who I gave it intention was not to make it public. It was a pretty much rare thing until this 3rd person leaked it. We are now going to notify Hixk so he can make changes in the client that would not allow this source to connect. Will take some time until someone figures it out. Good thing is noone currently knows what I changed in it, so you won&#39;t have any hints for fixing it.


Edit: remove this. I decided development section is better for it.</description>
