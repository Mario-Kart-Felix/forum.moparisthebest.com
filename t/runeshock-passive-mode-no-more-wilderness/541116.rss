    <title>Runeshock Passive Mode - No more wilderness</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runeshock-passive-mode-no-more-wilderness/541116</link>
    <description>Passive is a mode where you are safe from other players, but if you happen to disable passive mode you are able to attack, and be attacked by other players. If you have already disabled passive mode, and want to re-enable it a time will pop up and tell you how much time there is till it&#39;s activated. Now you can skill, and enjoy watching a good fight while in passive mode, or you can watch your favourite PK&#39;er get his groove on following him around. Any who I believe passive mode is a great idea, and thus removing the wilderness at the same damn time. Please don&#39;t mind the poor following, I have not added it in to the the client yet. This is an unfinished system, I still have to add warning signs, and fix the timer, I am just giving you an example. Your comments, critiques, and ideas on this matter are highly appreciated.

<p>Its not going to be a command. This was just a rough sketch too show the community. I have new head icons, a custom target system (Just like BH with a penaly timer), pvp drops, cash drops for untradeable items like osrs, etc.</p>

<p>I get that… But you’re missing the point.</p>
<p>With the wilderness there is actually a chance you can escape by running to the safe zone. If you are attacked with passive mode off, there is no safe zone, and you aren’t able to turn passive mode back on due to being in combat. Therefore you are dead as there is no escape…</p>
<p>If the player fails to see the magic attack incoming, and they land a freeze or whatever before you can get back into passive, there is no way out.</p>
<p>I’m not slating the idea I like it. But ideas like this need to be balanced in order for it to work.</p>

It’s a must for them to able to get back into passive mode while in combat only because there are no safe zones to run too, that’s why you must turn passive mode on if you’re low on food or other supplies. If you are in combat a one minute timer will appear. If you are not in combat and want to re-enable passive mode there is no timer.</p>

<p>I can see huge issues with this already.</p>
<p>If they’re in combat a one minute timer will appear until they can get out of passive mode. What if they’re always in combat and don’t want to be? i.e. being attacked by others, or being chased by others with magic or whatever, even melee.

<p>Thank-you Vain.</p>
<p>On a side note, it would honestly work well. If you saw someone coming to attack you, you can log out while passive mode is disabled, and it will be re-enabled in panic situations.<br>
You can go into passive mode before getting attacked without any timer needed, it’s only for those in combat. Also why in the world would you want to leave passive mode without being properly equipped? I have already set enough warnings set to disabling passive mode, that the player himself understands leaving passive mode would put the user in danger. There’s really no flaws in this other than the 75% attack following, which is driving me nuts at the moment. I also made it if you X-logged while in combat, you are still connected till you leave combat. You will also still have passive mode disabled as well, so you would have to re-enable it upon log in.</p>

              <p>Idea is okay but what happens when the majority of the server is in passive?</p>
<p>How do you know who is passive and who isn’t? Do you have to attack everyone and hope for the best?</p>
<p>Somehow escaping the attack and switching back to passive could ruin a fight.</p>
<p>A lot needs to go into this idea to make it worthwhile and balanced. If it’s not balanced and looks half assed no one is going to play.</p>

<p>I made it so if a player goes out of passive mode a white skull pops up, but if they were to attack a player that skull will turn red. Also, there is a miniature interface telling you hp, energy, and prayer.</p>

              <p>Passive is a mode where you are safe from other players, but if you happen to disable passive mode you are able to attack, and be attacked by other players. If you have already disabled passive mode, and want to re-enable it a time will pop up and tell you how much time there is till it’s activated. Now you can skill, and enjoy watching a good fight while in passive mode, or you can watch your favourite PK’er get his groove on following him around. Any who I believe passive mode is a great idea, and thus removing the wilderness at the same damn time. Please don’t mind the poor following, I have not added it in to the the client yet. This is an unfinished system, I still have to add warning signs, and fix the timer, I am just giving you an example. Your comments, critiques, and ideas on this matter are highly appreciated.</p>
