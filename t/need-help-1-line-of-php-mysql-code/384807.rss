    <description>I&#39;ve seriously been on this for over 4 hours trying to get this to work. I know there&#39;s a simple fucking way, I just don&#39;t know much about PHP and I&#39;d appreciate if someone can help me correct this.

mysql_query(&quot;UPDATE Votes2 SET amount=&#39;amount + 1&#39; WHERE ip=&#39;$ip&#39;&quot;, $link);

So about this.. If I replace amount + 1 with 1, it changes it in the table to 1. If I replace it to 0, it changes to 0. That removes the question if &quot;Is it even running that?&quot; because yes, it is working properly.

But, when it&#39;s amount + 1, what I want it to do is, grab the &quot;amount&quot; variable, and add 1 to it. So, if the amount is 1, it changes to 2.

I&#39;ve also tried changing it to $amount + 1, and of course $amount+1 or amount+1 doesn&#39;t change anything, so please don&#39;t suggest that.

I&#39;d appreciate a response with an answer, if you could, not something to waste my time.

tl;dr, how can I grab the &quot;amount&quot; variable and add 1 to it, then re write it to the SQL table</description>

<p>First few results show you.</p>
<p>Your problem is the single quotes around ‘amount + 1’, remove those.[/quote]<br>
I appreciate your help, Mopar.</p>
<p>I spent 4 hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong (Not even exaggerating), but right after I posted this, I removed those and it worked fine. Should have edited.</p>
<p>If you happen to read this again, what’s the exact day you’ll be opening sponsored servers again? I don’t remember what the last one was, seems like it was the 10th-15th.</p>
