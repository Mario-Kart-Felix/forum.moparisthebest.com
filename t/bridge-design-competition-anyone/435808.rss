    <title>Bridge Design Competition Anyone?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bridge-design-competition-anyone/435808</link>
    <description>In engineering we used this program to design virtual bridges. I found out the developers of the program actually hold a contest to see who can build the cheapest bridge. The cheapest entry they have had for the 2011 competition was $150,508.00. The lowest I have built was a 164,***.** at my school, although so far at my computer I have a 167 grand bridge. If anyone wants to try and beat the record of 150,508.00 use the 2011 software as each revision seems to price the members differently. I thought it would be pretty cool to see what different designs people could come up with and see if anyone could beat the record haha.
