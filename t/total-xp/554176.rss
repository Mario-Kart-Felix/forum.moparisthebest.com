Uhh… what???</p>
<p>I’m not even understanding what you even mean right there.</p>
<p>Also: Would be a really bad idea to store the variable as an integer.<br>
Lets say you have 25 skills.<br>
Each skill can have 200,000,000 EXP.<br>
200,000,000 * 25 = 5,000,000,000.</p>
<p>Max value of an Integer: 2,147,483,647</p>
<p>You’d have a kinda big problem there.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">You should store it as a long.</span><br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I was saying i’d have to create a coding like that to send the xp to client, and your saying i should do this:<br>
or cut it down to where the xp in all skills will add to the max of 214700000</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>I said it should be saved as a long. so, the part in the code tags.<br>
However. Looking at your client’s code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>It appears you only use an Integer for the total XP in the client.<br>
Which means it would be useless to save it as a long… due to your client only allowing an int.<br>
(That’s fine because last i recall the counter is supposed to go up to 2b and then say “Lots!”)<br>
That being said, you don’t need to change it to an int.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>As for sending it to the client:<br>
There’s a few ways you could do it.<br>
You could hard code an if statement into packet 126, where you check if the id is some really high number (That wouldn’t be on an interface), then you set the xp to the value of the string (But converted to an int).<br>
or -<br>
You could use packet 134 and use an unused skill id (like 50?), along with the xp (And a fake level too ofc).<br>
Then in the code client sided for packet 134 just make an if statement for that id alone and update the total xp.<br>
If you do this method, make sure that you place it above where the values are set to the arrays for exp/levels/etc. Also make sure to add:</p>
<p><code>
pktType = -1;
return true;</code><br>
(pktType may be different)<br>
at the end of the if statement so it doesn’t continue to the arrays.</p>

<p>Pretty much id have to come up with something like this for xp to send skill experience? and i just thought of something the viarable for setting xp i would set that to max xp like public int total = 214700000</p>
<p><code>public void appendSlayerExperience(int i) {
		int npc = 0;
		Client c = (Client) PlayerHandler.players[npcs[i].killedBy];
		if (c != null) {
			if (c.slayerTask == npcs[i].npcType) {
				c.taskAmount--;
				c.getPA().addSkillXP(npcs[i].MaxHP * Config.SLAYER_EXPERIENCE,
						18);
				c.getPA()
						.sendFrame126(
								"@whi@Task: @gre@"
										+ c.taskAmount
										+ " "
										+ Server.npcHandler.getNpcListName(c.slayerTask)
										+ " ", 29168);
				if (c.taskAmount &lt;= 0) {
					if (c.combatLevel &lt; 50) {
						c.getPA().addSkillXP(
								(npcs[i].MaxHP * 8) * Config.SLAYER_EXPERIENCE,
								18);</code></p>

It’s really easy to save the total xp:</p>
<p>First: You have to make a variable to store it.<br>
Second: You need to <span class="bbcode-i">save that variable to the character file</span><br>
Third: Whenever the player gains XP, you add said xp to the variable.<br>

<p>Here is what I did and I was not sure about the Third or Fourth but I think Third would be the First post.</p>
<p>Third? player.java</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Second? playersave.java</p>
<p><code>} else if (token.equals("Total")) {
						p.Total = Integer.parseInt(token2);</code></p>
<p><code>characterfile.write("Total = ", 0, 12);
			characterfile.write(Integer.toString(p.Total), 0, Integer
					.toString(p.Total).length());
			characterfile.newLine();</code><br>
Fourth: Not even sure but I was thinking where it says “Total” I would use that as my Variable on source side in player.java and that digits - 12 as part of the character file.</p>
<p><code>private void drawCounterOnScreen() {
		int x = 490;
		int y = 46;
		digits = xpCounter == 0 ? 1 : 1 + (int) Math.floor(Math.log10(xpCounter));
		int lengthToRemove = Integer.toString(xpCounter).length();
		int i = aTextDrawingArea_1271.getTextWidth(Integer.toString(xpCounter)) - aTextDrawingArea_1271.getTextWidth(Integer.toString(xpCounter)) / 2;
		int a = lengthToRemove == 1 ? 5 : ((lengthToRemove - 1) * 5);

			xpAddedPos++;
			if (xpAddedPos &gt;= 100) {  // controls xp flow how fast or slow

No, the third is third for a reason.<br>
You have to CREATE the variable, before you can use it. (Step 1)<br>
You have to SAVE the variable, so it will actually update. (Step 2)<br>
Then, after that, you actually have to… UPDATE THE VARIABLE (You know, add xp to it?). (Step 3)</p>
<p>Get why it’s step 3 now? Because it’d be really, really, really hard to add exp to a variable that doesn’t exist (Which is what you said to do, by doing step 3 first).</p>
<p>As for 4:<br>
You’re looking at the wrong code. That code simply draws the xp on screen (And the flag when xp is gained).<br>
I’d take a guess and say that the Total XP is set via packet 134.</p>
