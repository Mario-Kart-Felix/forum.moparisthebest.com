    <description>Anyone have any riddles or conundrums to share? I love them, especially when they&#39;re based on math. :)

If you do in fact have some to share, post the riddle or conundrum and post the answer in very small font so we can&#39;t &quot;cheat&quot; haha.</description>

<p>[size=1pt]1, 9, 10, 34, 49[/size]</p>
<p>Meets the following conditions:</p>

<li>all are between 1 and 49</li>

<li>none of the differences are prime</li>
<li>none of them are prime</li>
<li>none of them contain prime numbers</li>

<p>Yeah, what david said. Yours doesn’t follow the principle that the differences between each number is also different from all other differences.</p>

              <p>Anyone have any riddles or conundrums to share? I love them, especially when they’re based on math. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>If you do in fact have some to share, post the riddle or conundrum and post the answer in very small font so we can’t “cheat” haha.</p>
