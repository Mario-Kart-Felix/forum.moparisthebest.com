    <description>ok, if anyone could help, it would be great...heres what i did. 


1. i downloaded and installed no-ip, and i made my server name...
2. i went to the guide for my router, which is 2wire.
3. i made an application called &quot;rune&quot; and i made the ports from and to 43594, and the main port 43594.
4. i made it so the application would not be blocked by firewall (which is what it said to do.)
5. i turned on no-ip and went to my server file. and ran it.
6. it said it was starting up on 0.0.0.0 which isnt right....
7. i cant log on, and im stuck

if someone could help me out, it would be awesome


thanks,
