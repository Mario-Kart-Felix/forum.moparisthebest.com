    <title>Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0. - a bad choice!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/girlfriend-7-0-to-wife-1-0-a-bad-choice/30624</link>
    <description>Dear Tech Support


Last year I upgraded from Girlfriend version 7.0 to Wife version 1.0. I
soon noticed that the new program began unexpected child processing that
took up a lot of space and valuable resources


In addition, Wife 1.0 installed itself into all other programs and now
monitors all other system activity ,Applications such as Poker Night
10.3, Football 5.0 , Hunting and Fishing 7.5, and Racing 3.6


I can&#39;t seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background while attempting to run
my favorite applications. I&#39;m thinking about going back to Girlfriend
7.0 , but the uninstall doesn&#39;t work on Wife 1.0. Please help


Thanks, Sir

Dear Troubled User


This is a very common problem that men complain about


Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0, thinking that it is
just a Utilities and Entertainment program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM


You cannot go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 is designed to not
allow this ,Look in your Wife 1.0 manual under Warnings-Alimony-Child
Support


I recommend that you keep Wife1.0 and work on improving the situation. I
suggest installing the background application &quot;Yes Dear&quot; to alleviate
software augmentation


The best course of action is to enter the commandC:\APOLOGIZE because
ultimately you will have to give the APOLOGIZE command before the system
will return to normal anyway


Wife 1.0 is a great program, but it tends to be very high maintenance.
Wife1.0 comes with several support programs, such as Clean and Sweep 3.0
,beside Cook It 1.5 and Do Bills 4.2



However, be very careful how you use these programs . Improper use will
cause the system to launch the programNag Nag9.5 Once this happens, the
only way to improve the performance of Wife 1.0 is to purchase
additional software. I recommend Flowers 2.1 and Diamonds 5.0


WARNING!!! DO NOT , under any circumstances, install Secretary With
Short Skirt 3.3. This application is not supported by Wife 1.0 and will
cause irreversible damage to the operating system



Best of luck, Sir
