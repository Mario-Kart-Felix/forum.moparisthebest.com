    <title>[REP++] How To Add 525 Gameframe To 317? [REP++]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rep-how-to-add-525-gameframe-to-317-rep/400064</link>
    <description>Hi all,

This is hopefully a simple question. After numerous attempts of using both the search bar, and google, I&#39;ve failed to find out how to add the 525 Gameframe to a 317 Client.

Unfortunately, I do not have the 525 Gameframe files.

If anybody were to give me the 525 Gameframe files, and explain to me how I can add them to my client, I will give you Rep++. I also don&#39;t mind if you forwarded me onto a tutorial on how to do so.

Thanks in advance, hopefully this made sense!
