              <p>Yes there is a web-client if you go to <a href="http://minecraft.net" rel="nofollow noopener">minecraft.net</a> and download the software they have which I assume is the “newest” one it connects directly to the web-client. Can you link me to a download page for the “newest” minecraft server cause my brother and I want to play this together.<br>
I tried downloading MCAdmin and I set it up but it wouldnt even let me connect to localhost and kept saying something about a heartbeat failure.<br>
PLEASE link me to a download where the server/client actually works lmfao.</p>

              <p>well, download the actual server. i didn’t know there was a “web-client” server. sounds kinda contradicting in some ways :P. but either way, i understand you are on the same external ip, but its not possible for you to be on the same internal ip. you need to have the server running off your external ip. if there is no way to change it, then there is no way for him to connect(being that he is on the same external ip)</p>
<p>being that 2 computers on the same network will never have the same internal ip, HIS will be different then yours, his computer cannot connect to your local host OR external ip</p>
<p>his external ip is the same as yours, so there would be no way for him to use that to connect to your computer. there may be a way around this, i would say google is a reliable source, but as for me, i havn’t found a way around it yet.</p>
<p>best thing i can tell you to do is to download the latest software and run your server, that way you can change the ip to your internal ip instead of local host.</p>

I’m using the server where you start out with everything like when you go to the minecraft homepage and want to find a server to play. At the top it says want to host your own? Here’s the software.<br>
I got that and everyone else can connect but him and I can connect to.<br>
He is on the same IP and it is portforwarded correctly as other people can connect.<br>
He can connect to other peoples servers aswell but mine.</p>

uhhhh, make sure your ports are forwarded correctly.<br>
make sure he is on your network if using the same external ip?</p>
<p>not too sure, but this used to happen to me on rsps awhile ago.</p>
<p>also, allow him to use your internal ip to connect, whilst everyone else uses your external ip, or even a masked ip.</p>
