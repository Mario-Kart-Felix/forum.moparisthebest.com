PkOwnage is a Server that has recently returned again from the old one that was running around 10 Months ago, We shut down for a while whilst keeping the forums and site running and now we&#39;re back with the release of a new OSRS Based server! You could almost say this is PkOwnage v5 or something haha, since I also ran a server named PkOwnage back in 2008 which never even achieved a VPS but still managed 15+ Online not bad for a Project Czar eh! Well, I&#39;m certainly still around and you can join me on the new PkOwnage Adventure!

Enough about PKing, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all well aware of how to! PkOwnage not only offers PKing but also a variety of Minigames, Bosses and challenges along the way! We&#39;re always looking for new additions to the server so that everyone has a great time when playing. A recent addition to the server was Revenants and we saw a huge increase of PK activity deeper in the wilderness; Which you&#39;re unable to teleport in unless you&#39;re in 20 or under wilderness! 

We have so much more to add to the server still and it&#39;d be great to hear your suggestions as to what you like and dislike; feedback is always welcome on our current forums! We do hope to move to a full professional website with web-host soon!
