    <description>Well...i dont know if this is the right area, but i was on moparscape server status and i saw that people could register websites, so i thought i&#39;d give it a try, but i made a huge mistake, i didnt know what website to put and everyone i tried was taken, so i thought &quot;i didnt see www.runescape.com there&quot; so i tried that as i put it in it said i was banned then it redirrected me to meatspin......so if there is anyway for me to get unbanned can you please do it, as you can see it was not my fault and i will really like to keep registering my server....



Please and thank you

              <p>That’s your fault. The server status page is for Runescape Private Servers, nothing else. It’s not for websites. You tried to cheat the system to keep your server at the top of the list, and you failed.</p>
<p>Enjoy the repercussions.</p>
