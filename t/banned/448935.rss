    <description>I was banned by xvizardx17 at around 9:50 PM yesterday. I was just gathering materials for a house and then i was suddenly disconnected and banned for cheating. I was getting some block lag so i do not know if my character was jumping around or whatever the case was, but i can assure you i was NOT cheating. The only thing i have installed for MineCraft is a Texturepack called DokuCraft. Please reply so we can get this worked out, i really enjoy this server and i do not want there to be any miss-communication. Thank you!</description>
