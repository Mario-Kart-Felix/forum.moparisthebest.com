    <title>How much value does money really have?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-much-value-does-money-really-have/330828</link>
    <description>This past weekend my friend and I bought 10 McChickens and 10 McDoubles when we knew we would have been fine with 1 of each. Later I think back on it and evaluate the value of money and how much it really means to us. I did it for the memory and fun.

So, ITT, discuss how much you value cash? Could you go out of your way to buy a homeless person food? Buy something to use for only a day? Make an over-the-top donation to something?

Also, if you&#39;ve done anything that you could consider a &quot;waste of money&quot;, tell about it.

Discuss.</description>

I partially agree. But who would like to sleep in the cold rain, or in the middle of winter, in dirty streets, where you’re respected by no one.

<p>So common respect has to go down the toilet because you deem money to have no value (and in doing so valuing anything that requires money to purchase worthless)?<br>
You need money to get by these days. Homeless people beg for <span class="bbcode-b">money</span> they don’t choose to live on the streets because ‘money has no value’. Homeless people still use money in order to get by in day to day life.</p>

<p>Money was developed in an early age to determine the value of items. I know I wont hit every key point in the matter, but say your a nomad wondering South America. You fish for a living while others farm. You want crops while they want fish. Back then it was based on bartering and trading. But how do you determine how many carrots equals a fish? And what if it’s the middle of winter and you’re unable to grow anything? Upon this crossroad, currency was established along with a universal value of all things. Trading irrelevant items became obsolete due to how different the circumstances for each item was. This is the only true established purpose of money, and without it we would resort back to some form of systematic trade, lowering ourselves to cavemen.</p>
<p>Now, you look at society’s philosophy on the way it’s distributed, how it’s put on a pedestal, favored over all things. We’ve become tied down to material, no doubt. But, without a physical form a value for anything, I don’t believe we’d be as far as we are in society today.</p>

Indeed, I mean people fight over money, when really why don’t you fight over what you want to get with the money? It saves a step of buying the thing, with the money you stole/took…If you got/don’t got money, its best not to waste your life trying to get it, but you should be just having some fun, life it too short to waste.</p>

<p>[quote=“Across the Universe”]Max’s Father: Goddammit, Max! Get serious, for once! What are you going to DO with your life?<br>
Max: Why is it always what will I do? “What will he do”, “What will he do,” “Oh, my god what will he do”, Do, do, do, do, do. Why isn’t the issue here who I am?<br>
Uncle Teddy: Because, Maxwell, what you do defines who you are.<br>
Max: No, Uncle Teddy. Who you are defines what you do. Right Jude?<br>
Jude: … Well, surely it’s not what you do, but the, uh… the way that you do it.[/quote]</p>

There’s a large proportion of homeless that are “phonies” and also a large percent that do it for alcohol and other drugs.

<p>The phrase “I need Africa more than Africa needs me” is an incredible example of how much money doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAB-zJPsJjs" data-bbcode="true">Short clip explaining the phrase.</a></p>
<p>If you cba to watch the video, it’s basically stating that we’re being fed negative incite on the African lifestyle. When you think of Africans you commonly portray them as poor, homeless, disease-rid, etc. There is a part of the society that the media doesn’t give us, and that is their enjoyment of life. They’re happy with what they have, no matter the circumstances. We’re so materialistic that we feel the need to pour it into countries deprived of such things, but have we ever took into account that they don’t necessarily need it? Of course, the fact that disease in a moralic point of view isn’t the right way to live, but the enjoyment they have can’t be taken away. In our case, when we take away money, it’s all we have.</p>
