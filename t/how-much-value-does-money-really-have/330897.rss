    <title>How much value does money really have?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-much-value-does-money-really-have/330897</link>
    <description>Here&#39;s another topic I figure I&#39;d have better input on via Moparisthebest, as moparscape doesn&#39;t consistently support any interesting replies.

This past weekend my friend and I bought 10 McChickens and 10 McDoubles when we knew we would have been fine with 1 of each. Later I think back on it and evaluate the value of money and how much it really means to us. I did it for the memory and fun.

My reply most concerning the subject on moparscape was:
[quote=&quot;ollie123, post:22, topic:330828&quot;]The sad truth is, money makes the world go round.[/quote]But, does the world need to go round in order to exist peacefully?

Money was developed in an early age to determine the value of items. I know I wont hit every key point in the matter, but say your a nomad wondering South America. You fish for a living while others farm. You want crops while they want fish. Back then it was based on bartering and trading. But how do you determine how many carrots equals a fish? And what if it&#39;s the middle of winter and you&#39;re unable to grow anything? Upon this crossroad, currency was established along with a universal value of all things. Trading irrelevant items became obsolete due to how different the circumstances for each item was. This is the only true established purpose of money, and without it we would resort back to some form of systematic trade, lowering ourselves to cavemen.

Now, you look at society&#39;s philosophy on the way it&#39;s distributed, how it&#39;s put on a pedestal, favored over all things. We&#39;ve become tied down to material, no doubt. But, without a physical form a value for anything, I don&#39;t believe we&#39;d be as far as we are in society today.

So, ITT, discuss how much you value cash? Could you go out of your way to buy a homeless person food? Buy something to use for only a day? Make an over-the-top donation to something?

Also, if you&#39;ve done anything that you could consider a &quot;waste of money&quot;, tell about it.

Discuss.</description>

Money does bring evil to the world due to greedy people and war over it and what not, but it also has great importance in surviving, if there weren’t money then how would there be order? Everyone could walk in anywhere because ‘You don’t have to pay for that!’ money is kind of balanced it brings good and bad to the world in my opinion.

Agreed. I wont how there was order back in the medieval times…[/quote]<br>
because they currency then as well? currency isnt a recent invention its been around for thousands and thousands of years</p>

<p>Not anymore. There aren’t that many currencies tied to gold anymore. Most currency’s exist purely on the basis of trade. The dollar exists because of oil, which means that the Federal Reserve can print as many dollars as they want.</p>

It would only eliminate that form of greed. You truly believe that if we no longer had money a majority of the population of earth would forget how to survive? You’re insinuating that money is what keeps humanity alive, and without it a large portion of the world would be deprived of said nutrient and die.</p>
<p>On the topic of third-world countries, did it ever occur to you that they believe in such a way of living? Perhaps they expect to die from such causes, it’s happened so often that I wouldn’t doubt they’re used to it. Of course, you can try to pend our way of living to their people and assume they’re lives are miserable, but look at us? You said it yourself, our half of society runs on greed and material. Which is better? It’s a lose-lose outcome with what you’ve said.</p>
