    <title>[req] fish sticks banner</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-fish-sticks-banner/450794</link>
    <description>I need a banner for my server, which consists of a large fish stick in the background and any font and size letters would be nice; just make sure it says &quot;Fiddle my Fishstick&quot; in the middle. The background can be any color, it does not matter and it must not be bigger than 750x750.

optional: 
You can make the fish stick in the background look like it&#39;s fighting a sword to give the banner more action.
You can add multiple fish sticks in the background to express how fattening my server is.
You can add a quote or such of your choice, any would be good, sort of like
[code]we put the sticks in RSPS.
let us fat you with our juicy server.
hungry? play our server![/code]

[right]thanks[/right]</description>
