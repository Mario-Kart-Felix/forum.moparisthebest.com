<p>I have now fully re written edge, updates a few things such as pking info ( F2 To show hits, prayer and what combat mod you are using.) i’ve removed a lot of npcs that were not needed from edge to make space for a staking area. Thanks for your co-operation guys.</p>
<p>EDIT: working on a full re write for the f2p wilderness as we speak and going to remove zombies from edge to adapt to staking ecnonomy</p>

You would be surprised it wouldn’t be the first time.</p>

I didn’t touch your server. I don’t like you, but I wouldn’t waste my time spamming a server that I could careless about. The only reason I did this was because our forum was spammed yesterday as well by another server. With that said I wouldn’t go out of my way to spam your whole site joking around on forums with you is different then attacking your site with adverts.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/final-pk">@Final-pk</a> Well who ever it was I hope they enjoy the mail I guess. Good luck with your server.</p>

              <p>thank you stEps appreciate it i hope your server goes well :), I can assure you that i have not spammed your server with anything at all, considering i have only just opened my server the last thing i need is enemies and more problems whilst trying to build a steady population. Players choose which server they go on and nothing else can change that, If you check my forums i can also assure i do not even offer hand outs to advertise my server, I’ve asked in game what forums player could advise advertisements and that’s my very furthest i have attempted to advertise at the moment as i was busy fixing bugs, changing domains and updating the server to what players suggested. I have no time at the moment to be logging onto other peoples servers and advertising my own when i could spend more time doing that on forums and not having this abuse…</p>

              <p>Seems okay, just the obvious reason of not being very populated but as its only 12 hours old you would expect that. i’ll see how it develops as the next couple of weeks go on.</p>
<p>EDIT: Seems reasonable enough exp for a pk server, not extremely hard you basically collect coins and weapons drops and buy whats needed, you can afk from 20 minutes into training anywyas. nobody has rune yet from what i’ve seen, Seems to be full addy and addy 2h bought from shops.</p>
