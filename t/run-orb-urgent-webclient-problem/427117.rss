    <title>Run orb + urgent webclient problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/run-orb-urgent-webclient-problem/427117</link>
    <description>Well I just encountered this with my webclient.
Everytime you refresh the page the client is on. an error pops up. and then you need to restart your browser to get the client to work again. Is there even a solution or should I just put a warning up?



So you know the little guy in the run orb?
I need that image. the one I currently have is him sitting.
Does anyone have one I can just like steal lol?</description>
