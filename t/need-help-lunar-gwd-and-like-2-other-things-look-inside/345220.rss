And if you want to help thanks (:, i just want to learn how to do this. - not by tut&#39;s you show me, through teamviwer. 
Here is my msn = fear_michael@live.com, and if you want i could give you a runescape account for helping.

some things it has.
-full void. 
-the full barb ass Armour. 
-rune gloves.
-only 1 99 in strength.
-alot of high skillz.
-around 7m cash.
-and alot more.


Also how would i make it so i can switch through prayer book&#39;s by talking to a npc?
