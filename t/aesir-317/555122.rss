Hi, Aesir PS is a relatively new 317 rsps, however, we run high revision items, such as nex sets. We have all bosses, of course, including some of our own takes such as bandos avatar. We have pets for all bosses and some dragons (Frost, baby blue and green).
Easy training with instant teleports by clicking the skill you want to train.
Unique donator zones, fully working dungeoneering.

We have much more, but I shan&#39;t bore you with the details. I hope to see you online! Add me :Colossux</description>
