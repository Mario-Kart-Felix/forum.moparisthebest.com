              <p>If I recall correctly, and I believe I do search for this in your client.java -</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">        return 142;</code></pre>
<p>Change the 142 to 99 =) Also I do not believe talking about rep is aloud, you wouldnt want to get in trouble =\ Good luck with your server btw.</p>
