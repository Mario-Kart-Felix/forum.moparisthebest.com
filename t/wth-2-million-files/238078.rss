    <title>WTH, 2 million files?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wth-2-million-files/238078</link>
    <description>I ran my AV like I do every week, and this time I noticed how many files it actually scans. It were about 2 million, and it took about 3 hours. Is this normal? Because it sucks dick really.

I also have a HDMI thingy on my laptop. With HDMI you&#39;re supposed to lose no quality whatsoever. But because my tv screen is bigger then my laptop screen I actually do lose quality. Is there any way to prevent this?

              <p>I ran the virus scanner for the first time in over a year. Guess how many viruses it found? 0.<br>
It took like 6 hours to scan though…</p>

<p>Your laptop screen doesn’t limit the resolution of another screen, just don’t set them up as a clone display, set them at different resolutions.</p>
