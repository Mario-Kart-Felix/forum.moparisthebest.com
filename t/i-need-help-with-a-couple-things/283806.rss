    <title>I need help with a couple things</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-a-couple-things/283806</link>
    <description>Okay, I&#39;m using a Allstar-scape server base, and i need to know a couple things. 

1) Were are the commands located in it? There are no class.java&#39;s so don&#39;t say that. 

2) When I give myself 999 str, it gives me 999/99 str. When I attack something, my str slowly goes down. How do I keep it at 999?

3) Where can I change equipment stats at?

Thank You soooooo much.
