    <description>i need help with something i want to make my own source, but i cant find a blank one and i was told to just dl one with good antilag and stuff and then just take the files out and it would be blank and im not sure what files to take out

question #2
-ok to accualy get the server online i was just testing to see if i could get one online
ok im not good at portforwarding so im pretty sure that&#39;s it
i have the no-ip thing open and my no-ip is checked i go to silabsoft client and type it in and it doesnt work

on my port forward thing i have it set like this

Tcp 43594 43594 192.169.1.29 43594 43594

im pretty sure the ip thing is my problem because non of the guides say what ip to put there so i just put my computer static ip address what am i supposed to put in it?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 19, 2008, 08:44:23 pm[/size][hr]please some1 reply to this i seriously have looked everywhere</description>
