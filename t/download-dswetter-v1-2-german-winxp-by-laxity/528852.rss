    <description>I can&#39;t imagine what that means.They&#39;re both oaks because they have acorns; their leaves are arranged in a spiral.But other things about them are different.So are you saying that the trees in the Fringe Gyre are intelligent, like the Hist?They communicate, as the Hist do, but in different tones.

I didn&#39;t really learn to hear them until Fhena showed me, and then — » «Fhena?She helped me find you.Surely I mentioned her.She thought he sounded defensive.She looks like a Dunmer. 
I&#39;m just wondering, if you&#39;re so friendly with her, why you haven&#39;t mentioned her before.And what did she have to be jealous over?But the fact that after all of these years as best friends, he hadn&#39;t mentioned her вЂ¦ She pushed it off.Umbriel is from Oblivion, too, so it doesn&#39;t seem too far-fetched to me that they could be cousins.I think the city tree somehow called Umbriel, or the Fringe Gyre trees may have called to the Hist — but I think there was some sort of collusion.

Not as intelligent maybe, or maybe just in a different way.But like the Hist, they can form their sap into different things, the way you do with your equipment.And they can shape life, change its form.One of my tasks is to take raw ingredients from the sump and transform them into nutrients for the trees, but part of that process involves getting the roots themselves to release substances.I haven&#39;t worked in the large fermentation vats, but I have noticed there are always roots involved.</description>
