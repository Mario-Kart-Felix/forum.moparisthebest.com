    <description>Hey guys. Okay so here&#39;s the problem today. I&#39;ve got my client jarred and signed and everything, I jarred properly, signed properly, I am positive my signlink and my cachedownloader is correct but there is one little error. For some reason other people can login to the jar but I cannot. I can&#39;t even login from the client itself. I have changed all the ips to my ip but I cannot login. If I change it back to 127.0.0.1 I can login but others cannot. Please if you can help me with this message me on skype: josh.cougan or just put solution in the comments below. I am using Ardi 2.0 Source and Client.

Thanks, Kingclawz</description>

              <p>not really just copy your client and paste and rename it with 127.0.0.1 as the ip and you will be able to log in from that one and others to the main one</p>

              <p>You didn’t port forward properly.</p>
<p>A cheap fix would be make a client for yourself that had the IP 127.0.0.1 and give your players a different client with your actual IP.</p>
<p>To make your own client; right click on the client folder and click copy, then right click and paste. Rename the copied client to something more appropriate like “localhost client” and change the IP in the client for you to use.</p>
