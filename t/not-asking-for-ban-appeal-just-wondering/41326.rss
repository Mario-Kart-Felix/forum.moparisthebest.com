    <title>Not asking for ban appeal just wondering</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/not-asking-for-ban-appeal-just-wondering/41326</link>
    <description>I was just checking one of my many banned accounts and this is odd.. never had this before
Has anyone ever got this?? 

it says

Offence Date Offence Type Appeal Status     
Legacy Punishment  Not Appealable  


not why would it says not appealable if I never appealed before on this account and im not that good with this english word it says &quot;legacy&quot; which I guess means obsolete ?

Well I dont need advise to getting it unbanned had nothing but a disk of return probbly still stuck in the blackhole. Just wondering if anyone got this before?  :|</description>
