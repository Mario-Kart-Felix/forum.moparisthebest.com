    <title>Multi combat zones</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/multi-combat-zones/256955</link>
    <description>In my server I have bosses such as kdb and the chaos elemental. These bosses are way to good for one player to kill by them selves. So i put the bosses all over the game in different caves and what not. but the caves i put them in are not multi combat. I was wondering how to make my own multi combat zones. 


Thank you,
