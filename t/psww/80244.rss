    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/psww/80244</link>
    <description>I just started useing psww (port siarm willow whacker) and everytime i started the script in the bank it would open the bank and look for best axe, and would end up saying failed to find best axe. Do you know whats wrong with that? but if i started with the steel ax already in my hand it would just walk to willows chop them then get almost to the bank and say it;s lsot and terminate itself. why? And if my runescpae name was
 &quot;g lil mee which it&#39;s not but if it was would my nick be lil? so if i start psww and the forum comes up and i fill in my name pass and nick it will find anti randoms? right? if you could answer any of these please do thank you.</description>
