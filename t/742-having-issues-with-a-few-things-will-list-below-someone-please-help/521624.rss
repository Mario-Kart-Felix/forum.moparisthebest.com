    <description>k so hey so im getting really confused with coding im almost done coding my server before I put it up online it’s a 742 server with matrix and rune evo files ok so my main problem is that when im coding I get confused well only with this problem I am trying to make a speical staf zone for me and the community once its up in the game and I am looking for like lets say like teleports that would have the corresponding code that all I have to do it change the name and coords I have looked under controlles commands eveything I cant figure it out... :/ do you know whats wrong or anyhting like I want to add a lot of commands to my server like ::home idk where to put it because my commands file is split up like into admin file, mod files, donor file support file,and last but not least regualr player file I don’t know what to code to make this happen...?
and my next question is im trying to add something in my game that when you do ::prices in game like a little scroll thing pops up and shows you the prices in the game again I don’t know how to do this maybe you know?
and last but not least like I have in my server if you click on the quest tab you have your teleports like skilling then it gives you options how would I take out some of those options teleports and add new ones in to make it better well this is the end of my email and I hope you read this and I can get an answer back and I can get my server out there and ready to go
