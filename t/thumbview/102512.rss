    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;ThumbView enables thumbnails and tool tips in MS-Windows XP Explorer for file types that are not natively supported. It started with PCX, TGA, and DDS, but now ThumbView supports an amazing 19 image types, directly in Explorer!

The program is not run as a process and will not consume memory nor CPU time; it is a shell extension (COM) called by Windows when it wants to display a thumbnail.

There are two packages: ThumbView and ThumbView Lite. The first is more for developers, as it allows easy extensibility by downloading or creating custom Thumbnail Extractors.

The Lite version comes with all image types supported by the full version, but is slimmed down as much as possible in order to provide a smaller download size and faster thumbnail generation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I personally use it to see PSD&#39;s in thumbnails ..
