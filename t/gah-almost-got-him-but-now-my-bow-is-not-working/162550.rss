    <description>Like some of you might have understood about the title, theres something wrong with a bow or bows, in my server.
Yes some of you were right, karil x-bow(4734) is not working, it atts with melee and i wanna get it fire only bolt racks(4740)
Could some nice guy (or girl) help me out here?  :)</description>

              <p>look for “getwepanim()” in client.java. thats just the emote, but I have no idea how to make it fire bolt racks, I know how to make projectiles but they never work out on another server source apart from my own :S</p>
