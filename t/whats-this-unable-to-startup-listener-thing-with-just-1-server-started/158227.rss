    <title>What&#39;s this &quot;unable to startup listener&quot; thing with just 1 server started?</title>

    <description>Hey, I know that usually when it says &quot;Error: Unable to startup listener on 43594 - port already in use&quot; means that there are 2 servers started... but this is when I only have 1 server started and I don&#39;t have any other things started... but to clear things out, it&#39;s not my server&#39;s files problems, but it&#39;s something on the computer.... because I have tried running a new clean source and it still does it... :/ Any one know? It must be another program that&#39;s using the port, but how do I find out what program?

And how do I remove or change that one program so it doesn&#39;t use that port?

It looks like this:

Error: Unable to startup listener on 43594 - port already i
n use?
[/code]

I start the server... then it just says working for a while then it&#39;ll just pop up... and when it does that, no one can get on anymore, but the people that are already on, can stay on, it&#39;s weird... and the server status list won&#39;t detect it anymore either, so my server keeps going offline... Which is bad....</description>

              <p>if you wish to check the ports, to find out whats using what, there are programs out there for it, also…it could be something such as an auto update tool for a virus scanner, or another program, watch what you do… just out of curiosity, have you tried other ports? if you try another port, it should work…</p>
