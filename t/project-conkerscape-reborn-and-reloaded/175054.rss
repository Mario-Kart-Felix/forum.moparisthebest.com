Project ConkerScape

[b]Introduction[/b][/center]
I made this server because now-a-days, private servers are getting ruined. Over half of them have not been touched, just downloaded and ran. Well, I&#39;m getting sick of it, so I decided to do something to it. That&#39;s when Project ConkerScape was born.

[center][b]Goals[/b][/center]
Of course, I have many goals for my server, but I also have goals for myself. I&#39;ve coded 7 servers before and ran them, but none of them were too complex and they already had half of the work done for me. So now I&#39;m making a change. I downloaded a clean source to get started on, and I want to code this all with using very limited or no tutorials. I really want to learn alot from this, and seeing as I will mess up alot, the release date isn&#39;t going to be for a few months most likely. I will keep this updated though.
Here are a few goals of mine:
Be extremly stable
Add some new items
Add recolored items
Good PKing, with an anti-mass, right weapon timers, single and multi zones
Skulling
Prayer works perfect: head icons, draining, can&#39;t use 2 of same type
Along with many more.

[center][b]Progress[/b][/center]
Client- 100% done, added all the items and fixed all the menus
Server- 10% done, found a good base

[center][b]Current Task[/b][/center]
My current task is: Making Skill Menus Work

[center][b]Credits[/b][/center]
Client:
80% - SWAT - Using her client as base client
15% - DOG EATS DOG - Used his recolored items
5% - ME - Changing all the ids around, misc. work

Server:
10% - Juzz - Using his clean source as base
10% - Paladino76, Reforced, Winter Love, I loot I - Refering to their sources when I need to
80% - Me - Everything else</description>

              <p>FINALLY. Make all weapons perfect timing so that weapon switching ACTUALLY HAS A MEANING. there are servers that have perfect timing but all weps are same speed. there would be no point in using a dragon sim towards a dragon 2h because they hit same speed. d2h is stronger tho MAKE THINGS LIKE range-2h or range-g maul possible</p>
