    <title>[562 REV] Good way to weaken Flooders/Spammers with very little code</title>

    <description>[color=blue]*NOTE* This doesn&#39;t stop them from logging in, but they wont be in your home location, or near a large group of players, so its almost pointless for them to do this.

This is very simple and also a good base for you to do other things in your 562 revision server.


In Actionsender.java search for starter. You should see an if statement. Under the if statement put this.
[code]		player.setLocation(3200, 3200, 0);
                        player.isTeleBlocked = true;[/code]

You can modify these coords to have the player be set somewhere else. 

In my servers I put an NPC that teleports them to the &quot;Home&quot; Location.

You can do this by opening up Npcpackethandler.java.

Once you have this open, under private void OPTION1 put you if statement like so...

[code]if(npc.getId() == #NPC ID#) {
p.turnTemporarilyTo(npc);
npc.turnTemporarilyTo(p);
p.getActionSender().sendChatboxInterface(241);
p.getActionSender().animateInterface(9850, 241, 2);
p.getActionSender().sendNPCOnInterface(#NPC ID# ,241, 2);
p.getActionSender().sendString(&quot;*NPC NAME HERE*&quot;, 241, 3);
p.getActionSender().sendString(&quot;Hello and welcome to the server!&quot;+p.getPlayerDetails().getDisplayName()+&quot;!&quot;, 241, 4);
p.tele(#COORDS HERE OF HOME#);
}[/code]

Things left for you to do: Spawn the npc you want in the correct location, and find a npc that talks. 


What this does: When a player logs in for the first time he is in a different location (good idea to make it closed in) and he isn&#39;t near the major population of the server so he can&#39;t flood advertise. Very easy and you can do more with this if you&#39;d like.


*NOTE 2*
Im going to be releasing a lot of 562 guides on here very soon, please tell me what you guys want and ill put it up!</description>

To create a piss poor way for “blocking” flooders? Your method is asinine, and useless. Your proposed solution is not a solution at all. In fact, it’s ultimately making any server that implements this, even more unstable. Just listen to people who know what they’re talking about. You might learn something instead of assuming that because your method “works” it’s the best method.<br>

It doesnt create more problems? And the reason is because there are currently an army of noobs that leech servers, make money off them, and pay good programmers to make their servers better<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>It does. If you don’t allow them to connect, it is much more efficient than allowing them to connect, taking up space in a player slot, and moving them to a DEFAULT_LOCATION.</p>
<p>You, nor anyone else can stop people from giving money to people who run servers. The system isn’t perfect. But what you’re doing is MAKING people pay for your code.[/quote]</p>
<p>Now your getting way off topic.</p>
<p>I’m not selling anything. This is just very simple and makes your server look a ‘little’ bit better than just some stupid leech.</p>
