    <title>How RuneScape stopped botting, and how to bypass one thing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-runescape-stopped-botting-and-how-to-bypass-one-thing/425956</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been trying to make a runescape bot (simple pixel checking and mouse positioning), so I thought i&#39;d try to figure out how RuneScape &#39;blocked&#39; the bots.
I have found two methods of how they do it:
1) They very gradually and un-noticeably (I did it through pixel checking the same spot in the same position over-and-over) adjust the color of everything, so pixel checks mess up.
2) They very slowly and also un-noticeably adjust the camera, so position checking messes up.

Now, I have found a way to bypass the pixel check, but I have yet to try the camera check, here it is:
[code]removed by me :3[/code]

You simply put in the x and y coords of the color you want to check, and the color you want to check is there, if that color is found it will return true.</description>

But I have now bypassed the camera check, and the bot moves to the proper places 10/10 tested times, I will be creating an autobot.</p>

Should remove this and just have people request it, Jagex comes on the site every once and a while to see what we are up too.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>But the ToS says they cant :C[/quote]<br>
Though I know you are joking about that, ToS are not really legal. More of guide lines of the site, like we can’t sue Jagex from coming on the site but if we know they have an account we will remove it. Basically just the ideal or code of conduct of a site more the actual laws.</p>

<p>Besides, the camera pass is still in there, though I have an idea of how to bypass that, i’ll try it in bout an hour.</p>

              <p>I’ve been trying to make a runescape bot (simple pixel checking and mouse positioning), so I thought i’d try to figure out how RuneScape ‘blocked’ the bots.<br>
I have found two methods of how they do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>They very gradually and un-noticeably (I did it through pixel checking the same spot in the same position over-and-over) adjust the color of everything, so pixel checks mess up.</li>
<li>They very slowly and also un-noticeably adjust the camera, so position checking messes up.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, I have found a way to bypass the pixel check, but I have yet to try the camera check, here it is:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>You simply put in the x and y coords of the color you want to check, and the color you want to check is there, if that color is found it will return true.</p>
