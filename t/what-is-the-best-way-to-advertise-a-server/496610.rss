<p>Like the others said above, put effort in, produce a nice server that doesn’t look like it was made by a 10 year old and people may consider playing</p>

              <p>I recommend learning Java and the practicality with programming a server because if you’re planning to go big you’re going to need a decent coded server (none of that crap that’s been released) so if you get any problems such as somebody starts dupping or what not you will have problems if you have no knowledge with the basic’s backing you up!</p>

              <p>You have to realize that having an area for conventional communication and even documented updates is not enough to catch someone’s attention. It is harder than ever to get someone interested, so you will have to make sure you have a lot of things the best you can push them to be, including your team, grammar, dedication, knowledge, and sociability.</p>

              <p>First, this should go in the general server discussion board.</p>
<p>[ul][li]Make only one advertisement thread per forums.[/li]<br>
[li]Be professional, don’t make it a leech.[/li]<br>
[li]Use unique content.[/li]<br>
[li]Either spend much time with the project, or have a professional-looking, dedicated team.[/li]<br>
[li]Don’t use <a href="http://webs.com" rel="nofollow noopener">webs.com</a> or the such to have your website. Either make one yourself or have someone you know do it for you.[/li]<br>
[li]If you’re willing to spend some cash, invest in some ads and sponsors. I would advise waiting for your game to take off before you actually invest in advertising with ads and sponsors.[/li]<br>
[li]Have periodic promotional events, such as “How many friends can you get to join?”[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Just a few. :rolleyes:</p>
