              <p>I have 4 stars :o</p>
<p>Here you go.</p>
<p>i am guessing this is a 317. If so this is what u do:</p>
<p>1.) go into spawning-config.cfg (something like that, havent worked with 317 ina while)<br>
2.) get a id of a portal (note it cant be the same id as a current portal)<br>
3.) put something like this in:</p>
<p><code>
spawn = (portal id)     (position coords)       (position coords)       0       0       0       0       04.) </code><br>
Go into clicking button’s.java and add something along these lines:</p>
<p><code>
                        case (case id):
                        if (c.teleAction == 199) {
                        c.getPA().spellTeleport(coords, coords, 0);
                        c.sendMessage("Welcome to bla bla bla");
                                                }</code><br>
hope i helped.</p>
