<p>Some. Not a lot are good.</p>

<p>Good is a preference (to you), the rifts are complex (a fact). Your original quote stated that the metal genre as a whole is easy and non-complex.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>The metal genre is mostly easy and non-complex.[/quote]</p>
<p>WHAT!</p>
<p>You listen to techno, TECHNO! And you’re saying Metal isn’t complex!<br>
Techno is the least complex genre there is.  Techno is just a series of beats put together which in the end is slightly catchy but sounds completely crap.  For you to say Metal is not complex is like me saying that you enjoy listening to dial up tone because you listen to techno.</p>
<p>Also I agree speed does not enhance the song simply because it’s fast.  The tempo can enhance the song and gives the musician the ability to play more complex riffs.  It’s not like in metal they just strum all the strings as fast as they can, for you to imply that is like my saying techno is just one consistant beat over and over again that never changes tone or anything.</p>
<p>You havn’t studied metal and if you did you would have failed.  Anyone who has studied metal at least appreciates it, you don’t have to like the sound of it but just because you don’t like it doesn’t mean it’s terrible.</p>
<p>You should go back to modelling, you do it much better than you do discuss music.</p>

<p>i dont listen to shit poser rock, i dont even listen to rock you moron. This is what happen when you assume things you mostly get them wrong.

<p>Well what do you listen to then, techno? Rock? Country? I mean other than Hip-hop Rap, Metal and Poprock there aren’t too many Genres and I can eliminate any slight dissonent genres such as punk, hardcore and such since you actually think that Viking Metal is harsh on the ears.<br>
Now don’t get me started on techno, it is pretty much the worst genre of music no matter how you look at it.  The only thing Techno has is a catchy beat, other than that it’s just 100% crap.  Now if you like Rock then that’s fine, I don’t understand though how Viking Metal can make your ears bleed if you listen to rock.  The only real differences are that the tempo is faster, there’s a harsh vocalist(usually) and they use a keyboard or sound system to generate pagan instument noises and crap.</p>
<p>Country is also 100% crap.  There are one of two good country bands but that’s only looking at talent, all country music is harsh on the ears and the stomach.</p>
<p>I assumed you listen to poprock music because you obviously your ears are obviously tuned to listen to that crap since for the reasons I have said above.[/quote]<br>
i dont listen to a particular genre i like songs from most aspects of music, for example i like a few metallica songs but i like the song scatman to complete opposites in terms of music i cant just pin down a bunch of music and say ‘you know what i like that!’ because it wouldn’t be true.</p>

<p>Say what again?</p>
<p>EDIT: If you like classic rock i’m 100% sure there are quite a few metal bands that would appeal to you, it’s an incredibly broad genre, ranging from brutal gory speed-riffs and shred-solos to melodic soft melodies with jazz/blues/classical influences.</p>

<p>i dont listen to shit poser rock, i dont even listen to rock you moron. This is what happen when you assume things you mostly get them wrong. I just listen to alot of things, most of which isnt even commercial music a lot of things on my ipod come from the newgrounds audio portal. How bout next time before you start sprouting bullshit you take the time to get some information?</p>

<p>Well what do you listen to then, techno? Rock? Country? I mean other than Hip-hop Rap, Metal and Poprock there aren’t too many Genres and I can eliminate any slight dissonent genres such as punk, hardcore and such since you actually think that Viking Metal is harsh on the ears.<br>
Now don’t get me started on techno, it is pretty much the worst genre of music no matter how you look at it.  The only thing Techno has is a catchy beat, other than that it’s just 100% crap.  Now if you like Rock then that’s fine, I don’t understand though how Viking Metal can make your ears bleed if you listen to rock.  The only real differences are that the tempo is faster, there’s a harsh vocalist(usually) and they use a keyboard or sound system to generate pagan instument noises and crap.</p>
<p>Country is also 100% crap.  There are one of two good country bands but that’s only looking at talent, all country music is harsh on the ears and the stomach.</p>
<p>I assumed you listen to poprock music because you obviously your ears are obviously tuned to listen to that crap since for the reasons I have said above.</p>

</aside>
<p>i dont listen to a particular genre i like songs from most aspects of music, for example i like a few metallica songs but i like the song scatman to complete opposites in terms of music i cant just pin down a bunch of music and say ‘you know what i like that!’ because it wouldn’t be true.</p>

<p>You’re missing the point, what I was saying is that you must have a shit taste in music or know pretty much nothing about it because those are the only 2 explainations for why you’d see viking metal as brutal death metal and terrible.<br>
[/quote]<br>
my taste in music is shit because its not your taste? what communist regime are you living in.  You dont get the whole concept behind opinions do you?[/quote]</p>
<p>Nope, I was saying your taste of music is shit because you post a reply on this thread saying how it makes your ears bleed and is brutal death metal as well as the further things you have said that have led me to the conclusion that you are a faggy poser who only listens to the music he does because his friends do.  Now i’ve explained about why the simple music you listen to is shit, i’ve provided many examples and now you are just getting frustrated and confused because you are simply full of shit.<br>
Yes you are aloud to have an opinion about my music but the thing is viking metal is no more harsh on the ears as Justin Timberlake or Foo Fighters.  I have opinion about your music and well since you know so much about the concept of opinions you should know that no opinion can be right as for an opinion to be right it must become a Scientific Argument.<br>
You have to remember that being right is not a democracy, you can’t just pick and choose facts.  Viking metal is a well developed genre and most if not all of the bands that come under it are amazingly talented.  Now you may not like that music, it may be too dissonant for you but for you to criticize it with nothing but your opinion and then act as if I think I’m living in a communist regime is just going waaayy too far.</p>
<p>You have brought no argument to the table, you came with your opinion and you will leave with an opinion, whether or not you are as stubborn and arrogant as you make yourself out to be behind your words I will not know for sure.  But you see I don’t give a rats ass about your opinion, if you bring solid evidence proving me wrong then hell my mind will change.  The thing is though you can’t see the difference between the two, and that poses a big problem in this circumstance.</p>
<p>You say I don’t get the whole concept behind opinions? You’re the one that views them the same as facts, in simple you’re an idiot.</p>

There are 4 perfectly good reasons why it sucks and you neglected them for some reason, secondly I don’t just listen to what my friends listen to, in fact alot of my friends have obscure music tastes some would probably like this.

<p>its basically ear bleeding shite, i listen to whatever takes my fancy but two things i dont listen to are rap and hardcore death metal that sounds like someone is throttling a cat in front of a loudspeaker. Its not easy listening, its not something that gets your blood pumping, its not something you can dance to, its not music you can listen to and be social. Therefore it sucks ass.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>So it sucks ass because your ears are tuned to listen to shit poser rock music which all sound exactly the same btw and I don’t mean that as in they sound similar I mean that as in they use the same drum beat, practically the same 2 chord riffs over and over, the singer is just some fag with a retarded hairstyle and can usually dance better than he can sing. If you thought I left out bass guitar I didn’t listen to those bands and you’ll see that the bass guitarist plays like 3 notes the entire song.</p>
<p>Now look at viking metal.  The only thing each band has in common is a fast tempo(usually) and a singer who can grunt.  Now half the songs usually consist of harsh vocals and the other half clean.  Now the guitar is just insane I mean really the greatest guitatists in the world play death, heavy or thrash metal(of one of there varients/subgenres) why? Since you can’t play rock that fast, the only bands really to ever pull is off are Led Zepelin, Guns n Roses, Hendrix and Van Halen but them playing rock constricted their guitar skills.  Have you ever seen Jimmy, Halen, hendrix or Slash play when not with the band, they are insane!(though hendrix is always fuckin awesome!)<br>
Now lets look at the bass guitar, pretty much if you want to hear good bass guitar listen to Metal, they are absolutely insane, the only bass guitarists to ever get some were those in metal bands because they actually improve the songs dramatically!<br>
Drumming in metal is absolutely insane and it seems that the heavier you go the better the drummers get(except when you get into brutal grinddeath and deathcore) anway look at ‘BTBAM’, ‘Cannibal Corpse’, ‘Morbid Angel’ and as much as I hate to say it, ‘Mayhem’(Black metal has the best musicians but shittiest singers).</p>
<p>You say you cannot dance to music like this.<br>
Watch these two vids then:<br>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eML6X8VfAfY&amp;feature=related" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eML6X8VfAfY&amp;feature=related</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVPfdA-DOx0" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVPfdA-DOx0</a></p>
<p>See big difference in the crowd?  In the first vid they are social, they are having fun. In the second vid they are standing with there heads stuck up there ass’s discussion the current economic crisis.</p>
<p>Now if you go “Well that’s iron maiden though they aren’t as heavy” ok then i’ll get something heavier than viking metal, MUCH heavier:<br>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QW0-5tkh8U" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QW0-5tkh8U</a></p>
<p>Poprock music makes my ears bleed Sanga that doesn’t make it bad, from what i’ve said above explains why it is bad.<br>
Now what i’m confused about is how you can call viking metal “Hardcore Deathmetal” Viking Metal is very Melodical Deathmetal, that last link above is an example of deathmetal, hardcore deathmetal which i’m assuming you mean brutal deathmetal or deathcore is like dying fetus, I suggest you look them up so you know the HUGE difference between melocial deathmetal and brutal deathmetal.  If you say “Well it’s all deathmetal” it isn’t, melodical deathmetal is completely different than deathmetal, it’d be like saying evenesence and nightwish are as heavy as Slipknot.</p>

Have you ever seen Jimmy, Halen, hendrix or Slash play when not with the band, they are insane!(though hendrix is always fuckin awesome!)<br>
Now lets look at the bass guitar, pretty much if you want to hear good bass guitar listen to Metal, they are absolutely insane, the only bass guitarists to ever get some were those in metal bands because they actually improve the songs dramatically!<br>
Drumming in metal is absolutely insane and it seems that the heavier you go the better the drummers get(except when you get into brutal grinddeath and deathcore) anway look at ‘BTBAM’, ‘Cannibal Corpse’, ‘Morbid Angel’ and as much as I hate to say it, ‘Mayhem’(Black metal has the best musicians but shittiest singers).</p>
<p>You say you cannot dance to music like this.<br>
Watch these two vids then:<br>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVPfdA-DOx0" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVPfdA-DOx0</a></p>
<p>See big difference in the crowd?  In the first vid they are social, they are having fun. In the second vid they are standing with there heads stuck up there ass’s discussion the current economic crisis.</p>
<p>Now if you go “Well that’s iron maiden though they aren’t as heavy” ok then i’ll get something heavier than viking metal, MUCH heavier:<br>

<p>Poprock music makes my ears bleed Sanga that doesn’t make it bad, from what i’ve said above explains why it is bad.<br>
Now what i’m confused about is how you can call viking metal “Hardcore Deathmetal” Viking Metal is very Melodical Deathmetal, that last link above is an example of deathmetal, hardcore deathmetal which i’m assuming you mean brutal deathmetal or deathcore is like dying fetus, I suggest you look them up so you know the HUGE difference between melocial deathmetal and brutal deathmetal.  If you say “Well it’s all deathmetal” it isn’t, melodical deathmetal is completely different than deathmetal, it’d be like saying evenesence and nightwish are as heavy as Slipknot.</p>

when i said social i didnt mean a bunch of people cutting their wrists and worshiping Satan, i mean if you are just with some friends talking you can have it just playing on in the background. And again with the dancing you dont go to a club and they start pumping out this shit for people to dance to they play music that just gets your feet moving and your head bobbing.<br>
and seriously all deathmetal is the same just some idiot banging his skull against some drums while another idiot screams into a mic and a one or more idiots just plays the same few notes on a guitar over and over again</p>

<p>On a different note though, to each his own.  I would never try and force my musical beliefs onto someone, I just urge people to have an open mind and atleast give another genre a chance sometimes.</p>

<p>Bwahahahahaha, You really think that metalheads cut their wrists.  You’re a fuckin idiot!<br>
I don’t worship Satan, i’m Atheist ffs, when I wear a pentagram or shit like that it’s mocking religion, it’s a joke and people like you take it seriously that’s why we do it.</p>
<p>When you go to a club you go to get chicks, if you actually go for the music then I wouldn’t be surprised if you’re an insecure homophobic asshole who really needs to see a councilor about his problems.</p>
<p>ahahahahaha sorry but this part was just hilarious:<br>
“and seriously all deathmetal is the same just some idiot banging his skull against some drums while another idiot screams into a mic and a one or more idiots just plays the same few notes on a guitar over and over again”</p>
<p>For one we aren’t talking about death metal and two you’re 100% wrong, that is probably the worst explanation of death metal i’ve ever heard.<br>
Seriously if the drumming is banging his head to make that beat then holy shit he would be the greatest musician in the world.<br>
Those same notes on guitar must span to a range of about 300 because there are very few deathmetal songs that don’t constantly go up and down different scales.  Yes death metal is slightly repetitive in some sections but you wouldn’t be talking about that cause you don’t study this music, you know nothing about it and probably think that deathmetal guitarists just strum wildly.<br>
The vocalist doesn’t just scream into the mic it’s not screaming at all in deathmetal if the vocalist screamed it would be more like metalcore or possibly hardcore.  Vocalists for deathmetal bands use a technique called grunting, one which takes incredible talent to master though knowing you, you probably just think they just go RARWARWRAWRAWRAWRAWWAGRWAG because anything that isn’t a emofag crying into the mic or a shitty poser singing a very small range of notes is shithouse in your opinion.</p>
<p>Death Metal at it’s finest:<br>

<p>How can you say “and seriously all deathmetal is the same just some idiot banging his skull against some drums while another idiot screams into a mic and a one or more idiots just plays the same few notes on a guitar over and over again” when you listen to that range of musicians/bands.  If you changed “deathmetal is the same” to “the music I listen to consists of” and change “screams” to “Sings poorly” then that statement would actually make sense.</p>
