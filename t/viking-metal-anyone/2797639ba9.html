<p>ok so im guessing then you didnt read my post with reasons why it sucked ass. So for youe benefit i will re-iterate them for you:<br>
Its not easy listening<br>
Its not something that gets your blood pumping<br>
Its not something you can dance to<br>
Its not music you can listen to and be social<br>
There are 4 perfectly good reasons why it sucks and you neglected them for some reason, secondly I don’t just listen to what my friends listen to, in fact alot of my friends have obscure music tastes some would probably like this. I listen to whatever i hear that sounds good thats just how it goes.</p>

<p>its basically ear bleeding shite, i listen to whatever takes my fancy but two things i dont listen to are rap and hardcore death metal that sounds like someone is throttling a cat in front of a loudspeaker. Its not easy listening, its not something that gets your blood pumping, its not something you can dance to, its not music you can listen to and be social. Therefore it sucks ass.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So it sucks ass because your ears are tuned to listen to shit poser rock music which all sound exactly the same btw and I don’t mean that as in they sound similar I mean that as in they use the same drum beat, practically the same 2 chord riffs over and over, the singer is just some fag with a retarded hairstyle and can usually dance better than he can sing. If you thought I left out bass guitar I didn’t listen to those bands and you’ll see that the bass guitarist plays like 3 notes the entire song.</p>
<p>Now look at viking metal.  The only thing each band has in common is a fast tempo(usually) and a singer who can grunt.  Now half the songs usually consist of harsh vocals and the other half clean.  Now the guitar is just insane I mean really the greatest guitatists in the world play death, heavy or thrash metal(of one of there varients/subgenres) why? Since you can’t play rock that fast, the only bands really to ever pull is off are Led Zepelin, Guns n Roses, Hendrix and Van Halen but them playing rock constricted their guitar skills.  Have you ever seen Jimmy, Halen, hendrix or Slash play when not with the band, they are insane!(though hendrix is always fuckin awesome!)<br>
Now lets look at the bass guitar, pretty much if you want to hear good bass guitar listen to Metal, they are absolutely insane, the only bass guitarists to ever get some were those in metal bands because they actually improve the songs dramatically!<br>
Drumming in metal is absolutely insane and it seems that the heavier you go the better the drummers get(except when you get into brutal grinddeath and deathcore) anway look at ‘BTBAM’, ‘Cannibal Corpse’, ‘Morbid Angel’ and as much as I hate to say it, ‘Mayhem’(Black metal has the best musicians but shittiest singers).</p>
<p>You say you cannot dance to music like this.<br>
Watch these two vids then:<br>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eML6X8VfAfY&amp;feature=related" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eML6X8VfAfY&amp;feature=related</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVPfdA-DOx0" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVPfdA-DOx0</a></p>
<p>See big difference in the crowd?  In the first vid they are social, they are having fun. In the second vid they are standing with there heads stuck up there ass’s discussion the current economic crisis.</p>
<p>Now if you go “Well that’s iron maiden though they aren’t as heavy” ok then i’ll get something heavier than viking metal, MUCH heavier:<br>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QW0-5tkh8U" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QW0-5tkh8U</a></p>
<p>Poprock music makes my ears bleed Sanga that doesn’t make it bad, from what i’ve said above explains why it is bad.<br>
Now what i’m confused about is how you can call viking metal “Hardcore Deathmetal” Viking Metal is very Melodical Deathmetal, that last link above is an example of deathmetal, hardcore deathmetal which i’m assuming you mean brutal deathmetal or deathcore is like dying fetus, I suggest you look them up so you know the HUGE difference between melocial deathmetal and brutal deathmetal.  If you say “Well it’s all deathmetal” it isn’t, melodical deathmetal is completely different than deathmetal, it’d be like saying evenesence and nightwish are as heavy as Slipknot.</p>

when i said social i didnt mean a bunch of people cutting their wrists and worshiping Satan, i mean if you are just with some friends talking you can have it just playing on in the background. And again with the dancing you dont go to a club and they start pumping out this shit for people to dance to they play music that just gets your feet moving and your head bobbing.<br>
and seriously all deathmetal is the same just some idiot banging his skull against some drums while another idiot screams into a mic and a one or more idiots just plays the same few notes on a guitar over and over again[/quote]Sorry, but i have tons of friends who do not like metal much, but we usually sit down and listen to saxon, judas priest, black sabbath etc in the background while chatting.</p>
<p>About death metal all being the same: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fhVLykF3nU" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fhVLykF3nU</a> Not all death metal bands use growls/grunts, and fact remains that death metal is probably the most complex modern music there is (modern as in 20th century)</p>
<p>Also: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9RJXWxth5g" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9RJXWxth5g</a> yeah, that’s definately “the same few notes on a guitar over and over again”. Not only that, but the lead guitarist/growler is islamic and his name is “Muhammed Suiçmez”, so where does satanism fit in?</p>

[/quote]</p>
<p>Bwahahahahaha, You really think that metalheads cut their wrists.  You’re a fuckin idiot!<br>
I don’t worship Satan, i’m Atheist ffs, when I wear a pentagram or shit like that it’s mocking religion, it’s a joke and people like you take it seriously that’s why we do it.</p>
<p>When you go to a club you go to get chicks, if you actually go for the music then I wouldn’t be surprised if you’re an insecure homophobic asshole who really needs to see a councilor about his problems.</p>
<p>ahahahahaha sorry but this part was just hilarious:<br>
“and seriously all deathmetal is the same just some idiot banging his skull against some drums while another idiot screams into a mic and a one or more idiots just plays the same few notes on a guitar over and over again”</p>
<p>For one we aren’t talking about death metal and two you’re 100% wrong, that is probably the worst explanation of death metal i’ve ever heard.<br>
Seriously if the drumming is banging his head to make that beat then holy shit he would be the greatest musician in the world.<br>
Those same notes on guitar must span to a range of about 300 because there are very few deathmetal songs that don’t constantly go up and down different scales.  Yes death metal is slightly repetitive in some sections but you wouldn’t be talking about that cause you don’t study this music, you know nothing about it and probably think that deathmetal guitarists just strum wildly.<br>
The vocalist doesn’t just scream into the mic it’s not screaming at all in deathmetal if the vocalist screamed it would be more like metalcore or possibly hardcore.  Vocalists for deathmetal bands use a technique called grunting, one which takes incredible talent to master though knowing you, you probably just think they just go RARWARWRAWRAWRAWRAWWAGRWAG because anything that isn’t a emofag crying into the mic or a shitty poser singing a very small range of notes is shithouse in your opinion.</p>
<p>Death Metal at it’s finest:<br>

<p>How can you say “and seriously all deathmetal is the same just some idiot banging his skull against some drums while another idiot screams into a mic and a one or more idiots just plays the same few notes on a guitar over and over again” when you listen to that range of musicians/bands.  If you changed “deathmetal is the same” to “the music I listen to consists of” and change “screams” to “Sings poorly” then that statement would actually make sense.[/quote]<br>
i was sterotyping when i said that, admittedly its probably a small percentage but a stereotype nonetheless. And it does all sound the same its just ridiculous that people think theres a big variation between songs when each song sounds the same as the last. Do you not think i know about the list of music, admittedly it has grown since then, but its not like everything over a day old evaoprates from my memory and then you go on to talk about something completely irrelevant to that list of musicians. In fact you didnt’even talk about you just presented it.<br>
I’d like to present your reply to another thread</p>

<p>No, I was saying that you only like the music you like because your friends like it.  Pretty much I way implying that you don’t listen to that music because it is good but because of its image.  I was not being literal and the fact that you addressed that point incorrectly and in doing so ignored all the other points I made in my last post just shows you are completely clueless when it comes to music.</p>
<p>Classical isn’t well developed at all, I don’t know how you can say “classical is the most well developed genre” with a straight face.  Metal is pretty much the only genre that hasn’t completely surcome to glam and poserfags, yes some metal subgenres have such as nu-metal but most are still all about playing good music.  Now if you consider Hardcore, Grindcore, deathcore and all that as being metal then they are also shit, some early grindcore bands were decent but those genres are crap.  I don’t consider genres with “core” in the name to be metal as they aren’t really metal they’re like there own genre.  Screaming while playing shitty music and Grunting while playing incredibly good music are 2 completely different things.<br>
I’m just clearing that up since I agree that people who listen to that crap are retarded and most of the bands in those genres do make your ears bleed.  Why? Not because it is distorted but because there is no rythem or musicality at all really.  Those bands usually have very good drummers and decent guitarists but they’re never anything special and overall they make shitty music.</p>
<p>The heaviest music I listen to would be Deathmetal such as Morbid Angel, Embodyment, With Blood Comes Cleansing, Cannibal Corpse and a few others.  I mainly don’t listen to these bands since I listen to a huge variety, anything from John Lennon to Corpsegrinder though I only like John Lennon really cause he’s a chiller and his words are pretty inspirational.  If I ignore Lennon the Lightest shit I listen to would be Hendrix and Led Zepelin.</p>
<p>I love viking metal because of how symphonic and rythmic it is.  You only need to listen to a viking metal song once to be able to hum it in its entirety.</p>
<p>Thrash metal is and will always be my favourite genre simply because I love fast tempo and insane riffs.  I don’t like grunting that much though if it’s appropiate and suits the song then it’s awesome.</p>

<p>Firstly i’d like to say that of course i’m assuming, if I don’t assume then I don’t believe anything.  It is why we assume that is important, not that we assume.  I base my assumptions on what you have said in this topic and common knowledge about music and posers in todays society.<br>
Now I never said classical is glam and has poserfags, people don’t listen to classical because it is slow, boring and though it has great musicality it lacks originality and rythem.  Now you don’t listen to classical, I quoted the list of bands you said you listen to there were no classical bands and if there were it is amongst one of the very few bands in there I have not heard of before.</p>
<p>The song I posted is awesome imo, you don’t have to agree with that, the thing is though you said it’s hardcore deathmetal when it doesn’t even come close.  You have proven you don’t know much about music and know nothing about the metal genre.  What I don’t understand is how you can get pwned over and over and still stubbornly enforce your opinion on those who have proven you wrong.</p>
<p>The only times you could possibly make a proper argument is when you take what I say out of context but even when you do that there is a lot of fail involved, and that’s ignoring the fact that you took what I said out of context so you’ve pretty much put words into my mouth.</p>
<p>You havn’t analyzed the song or anything, saying that it’s just screaming with a guy banging his head on the drums and a guitarist playing the same riff over and over is not analyzing, it is a fuckin retarded attempt at an insult and I bet even hannah montana fans know that.</p>
<p>When it comes to music you are an arrogant, stubborn piece of shit.<br>
I at least have solid arguments against poprock and techo, you have your opinion and only your opinion and that’s what separates me from you, right from wrong.</p>

how can you make judgments  on what has developed my taste in music? you’re doing that assume thing again and, well it didn’t work so well last time now did it? And you really think there are ‘glam and poserfags’ in classical? you must be joking. With the first video posted it started out quite good it was slow and generally appealing, smooth and easy listening then the thrashing started and it ruined it. It sounded something reminiscent to Jakatta and that sort of music which is some of the best music around today.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Firstly i’d like to say that of course i’m assuming, if I don’t assume then I don’t believe anything.  It is why we assume that is important, not that we assume.  I base my assumptions on what you have said in this topic and common knowledge about music and posers in todays society.<br>
Now I never said classical is glam and has poserfags, people don’t listen to classical because it is slow, boring and though it has great musicality it lacks originality and rythem.  Now you don’t listen to classical, I quoted the list of bands you said you listen to there were no classical bands and if there were it is amongst one of the very few bands in there I have not heard of before.</p>
<p>The song I posted is awesome imo, you don’t have to agree with that, the thing is though you said it’s hardcore deathmetal when it doesn’t even come close.  You have proven you don’t know much about music and know nothing about the metal genre.  What I don’t understand is how you can get pwned over and over and still stubbornly enforce your opinion on those who have proven you wrong.</p>
<p>The only times you could possibly make a proper argument is when you take what I say out of context but even when you do that there is a lot of fail involved, and that’s ignoring the fact that you took what I said out of context so you’ve pretty much put words into my mouth.</p>
<p>You havn’t analyzed the song or anything, saying that it’s just screaming with a guy banging his head on the drums and a guitarist playing the same riff over and over is not analyzing, it is a fuckin retarded attempt at an insult and I bet even hannah montana fans know that.</p>
<p>When it comes to music you are an arrogant, stubborn piece of shit.<br>
I at least have solid arguments against poprock and techo, you have your opinion and only your opinion and that’s what separates me from you, right from wrong.[/quote]<br>
no you have no solid arguement you have an opinion you have exactly the same amount of argument i have, and again if you had read that post i did say that wasn’t all of them i have got many different things littered throughout my music files admittedly less than 1% of it is classical but i beleive there is one or two in there. Your knowledge of music is significantly lacking as well you know alot about the metal genre, well done you, want a gold star for that? And what do you mean you wouldn’t beleive anything if you didn’t assume, thats a ridiculous notion.<br>
And i beleive you said</p>

<blockquote>
<p> Metal is pretty much the only genre that hasn’t completely surcome to glam and poserfags</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>so either classical isn’t a genre now or you implyed that there are glam and poserfags in classical. Everything you have said has been left in context unless you meant it to come across differently in which case you should’ve explained yourself more, being able to present yourself in writing is a valuable skill i suggest you learn it.</p>
