    <title>iPod to mixer - problems with the output</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ipod-to-mixer-problems-with-the-output/360219</link>
    <description>Basically, I&#39;m connecting my Ipod to my mixer via a RCA to 3.5mm cable. The problem is that when left as is, the sound from the left speaker is really dull and quiet, but when I play with the cable around the 3.5mm jack end, I will get an occassional fix and the sound will be fine. I first assumed that it would be the wire inside that could be the problem, but when I connected my iPod straight to my amp the sound was fine. Only problem is that I now have no control over the treble and bass without running it through an EQ first.

Any ideas what the problem could be? I&#39;m gunna keep on messing around and hopefully I&#39;ll hit something. It was only a cheap cable so if you think it might be worth buying another one then I might as well.

cheers!!

My laptop will play fine through it, which I guess is enough seeing as all my music thats on my laptop is on my iPod. 

It isn&#39;t just the iPod though because I have tried a Zen Creative on it which also has the same problem. I&#39;ve also tried connecting the cable through a 3.5mm to a 3.5 female and gives me the same problem. I can&#39;t help but think that it&#39;s a problem with the jack rather than the wire.


**hahaha, ok...I had to bend the jack ever so slightly and now it&#39;splaying fine. I guess there wasn&#39;t the greated connection between between the two....cheap piece of crap.</description>

              <p>I think the problem is you must be holding your iPod wrong!  (Sorry about that, it was obligatory :P)</p>
<p>Anyway, yea when you can play around with the cable and make it change it’s just a bad connection, it could be the cable or either end.  If you can do what you did and eliminate both of the ends as a problem then it’s definitely the cable. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>I have about the same issue with my Ipod, but the problem is related to the Ipod 3.5mm output (have the same issue using different headphones).</p>
