We&#39;re not looking for people that just want some cash, I want people who are dedicated to coding Runescape servers, and have a lot of experience with them. Why start with so many staff? If you knew how much work is being done with the World of Warcraft server, you would know. We are under constant development there, and it needs to be the same way for the Runescape server. We need about 25-40 staff to start for this project, and need them now. So if you are looking to be apart of the next generations biggest private server community, here is your chance. [/center]
