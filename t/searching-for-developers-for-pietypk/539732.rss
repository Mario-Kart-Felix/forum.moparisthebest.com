    <description>[b]Hey guys, im currently searching for developers for pietypk we have around 20 active players a day.
it has only been me from the start. I have coded this and released this all on my own i have bought a domain and 24-7 hosting.
its been a great and active server, pietypk seems to be growing very fast! 

im now searching for developers for a reason because i am working way to hard and its growing and i cant keep it under control.
i will share the donations by 50% but i want someone who knows how to code so i will give you a couple if tasks to complete.

please contact me via forums only thanks.  :|[/b]</description>
