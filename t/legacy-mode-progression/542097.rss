    <title>Legacy Mode Progression</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/legacy-mode-progression/542097</link>
    <description>So, quite a bit of information was released today about Legacy mode. You can read about it at: http://services.runescape.com/m=news/legacy-mode--progress-update

It&#39;s still an alpha, so it&#39;s early on, but what I think needs an instant change, is the fixed game interface. Jagex is mixing the current interface style with the one before EoC. Here&#39;s the full screen, which looks just the same:

And here&#39;s the fixed interface:

There&#39;s also a comparison list of pre-EoC, EoC/RS3, and the future updates coming this summer for combat.

What do you guys think so far?</description>

<p>The UI is very similar to the one before EoC… And if you’re saying that one looks horrible, you’re a bit too late.</p>

<p>Too little too late imo. If they had done this within a few months of EOC they might have had a chance. But they destroyed their playerbase and the game is dead.</p>

</aside>
<p>eoc alone didn’t kill the game, it was a few specific updates all around the same time that completely shifted the direction of the game<br>
[/quote]For me, it was the over-complication of combat (including having HP go past the 990, the new resists and bonuses), the new interface, and some of the new art (specifically when they redid the player/face models AGAIN, and some of the new animations). Most of this was around the EOC time and I enjoyed the game before those changes. Of course everyone is different, but that was what drove me away and the people I played with as well.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>For me it was the armor update making everything very ugly. Rs was always third person so it had a good amount of detail for its camera view, then they went and added overdone armors and just overdid it. Nowadays the art has changed so much it looks cartoony. The shiny theme everywhere hurt my eyes its just a mess. Then came Solomons and SOF, made the game feel like a shopping mall. Then EOC which made the game more like WoW… I’d rather just play WoW than some wannabe clone.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>But your opinion is very biased and you never point out anything good or positive about the game. And everyone who dislikes RuneScape, ALWAYS compares it to WoW, thinking that Blizzard came up with all of their ideas and content.[/quote]<br>
There were tons positive about the game. I wasn’t one of the ones running around shouting WoW clone until EOC came around. I liked RS more than WoW, only reason I tried WoW was because RS was no longer the game I remember</p>

<p>But your opinion is very biased and you never point out anything good or positive about the game. And everyone who dislikes RuneScape, ALWAYS compares it to WoW, thinking that Blizzard came up with all of their ideas and content.</p>

I don’t agree that the combat triangle was melee based in 2011. Magic depending on what level you were and the spells you used, melee usually got raped.</p>
<p>Still nice to see Jagex trying lol. I’d consider playing again if it’s good.<br>

<p>It was definitely melee based.[/quote]<br>
I personally think it was melee based after you reached a certain level. Lower level combat was often only on range.</p>
