    <title>[525] Help with _js5connect</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/525-help-with--js5connect/283417</link>
    <description>Hello. I cannot log enter my 525 server. I have DragonScape client, and JC-SCAPE 525 server.
I am not sure on what to do.

it says that it cannot connect in the client, and in the Run batch file, it says my session was closed
I haven&#39;t got the slightest of clue what to do, so can anybody help me?

              <p>some 525 and 508 servers doesnt accept localhost (127.0.0.1 or 192.something.something lol)<br>
if u want to login a 525, use kids scape 525 client and go in client and client2 and replace it with ur ip, and appletsub1.java i think also, mabye framesub1.java, after u replaced the ip with ur ip, compile the client and login!<br>
~! I Hope This Helped !~</p>
