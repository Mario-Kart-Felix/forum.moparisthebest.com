    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-runescape-website-mike-rs-web/428335</link>
    <description>Hey guys,
Okay so ive been searching all over google and moparscape/ragezone/rune-server for the last 3 weeks
Ive searched hundreds of threads and pages and not once have I ever found a
Runescape or RSPS CMS apart from 

[PWT (Private Website Technology (v1.2) by Mikelmao] 
http://google.com/runescape-development/google/downloads/281630-release-official-private-website-technology-v1-2-a.html

Or [ ~~~~~Clasic RuneScape Website, Fully Feutured For Your RSPS~~~~~  by ProgramingForever]
http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,392386.0.html

And last of all [459] Full Runescape Website &amp; Knowledge Base by Faded Vision [ALL PAGES]
http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,434096.0.html

So what I need help with is I need someone to give me a link to download and please dont let the link be broken
ive searched so many times and found threads with broken links so if anyone has Mike Rs Web or any other runescape CMS
please can you post a download link!

</aside>
<p>THIS IS NOT THE REQUESTS SECTION. That’s the only reason I’m being an asshole to you right now. I asked you to P.M. me instead of spamming, but O.K. Also, I don’t remember you, you’re nobody. I’m just going to stop responding to this thread now - good luck with your phishing site.[/quote]Lmao what an ignorant person whether you read what im saying or not Team Rocket first of all you do not have to be an “asshole” to people who make a mistake of their second post and spamming? Im not spamming this is my thread, im simply responding and quoting you on your actions, which you obviously do not like and last of all “good luck on your phishing site.” if you even possess a capability to read at all then you will see it says “Mike Rs Web” in the title and in my post it says “Runescape  or RSPS CMS” ! Use that nugget of a brain and work it out “CMS” = Content Management System, and “THIS IS NOT THE REQUESTS SECTION” again as you can see this is my second post and its called a mistake instead of being what you stated “an asshole” you could simply correct me last of all I have to say you are the worst “Helper” on this forum and Im sure many would agree with me too not to say many would allso disagree, you see where Im going with this rite?</p>
<p>In the end it sums up that Team Rocket + Moparscape Forum = A pathetic noob who does nothing but give bad critism and flame and think you can allways get the last word, you have not attempted to help and you have not attempted to correct me and so in the end you fail Team Rocket</p>
