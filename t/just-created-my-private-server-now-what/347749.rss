              <p>Ok well in most rsps the owner has the command ::master try that it should give you all 99s if it doesnt then just go into your source file, look for the character files you should find your name somewhere in there open it up then scroll down and you should see your stats. Now replace all the skills that say 1 with 99 and all the XP that is to the right of the skill to 14000000. Now for unlimeted health your going to be looking at the skills the ones your just edited. your going to have to do trial and error on this part. you canot make ur health unlimited but pretty damn close. just pick one of your now 99 skills to 9999 and then log in see wich skill is now 9999 if it isnt hp then try again.</p>
<p>What i did at first with my server is just messed around with it. get to know your own server then change the stuff</p>
