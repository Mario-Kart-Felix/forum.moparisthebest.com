    <title>New restarter?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-restarter/175241</link>
    <description>Hi,
I would like to have a restarter that pings my server every few minutes to test to see if it is up, and if not, it will reset this. Unfortunately I cannot make this myself at the time, so any help will be appreciated :) Idea taken from http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/ITAPPMONROBOT.aspx
Thanks
