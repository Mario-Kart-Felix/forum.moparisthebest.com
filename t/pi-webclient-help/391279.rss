    <title>PI webclient - help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-webclient-help/391279</link>
    <description>Hello MoparScape and people who visited this topic.
[b]Before posting a comment , please , if you might help , read everything patiently.[/b]
Im quiet new to PI basement, and I need a very helpful topic for a PI webclient creation.
 I know, I could find one if I used search and stuff, but I really have not much time at the moment. School, small exams. Getting ready for Leaveout exams.
 So I just decided to ask you all guys with Server Help section.

Hopefully you&#39;ll help.

NB! Moderators, dont approciate this. Don&#39;t think that I&#39;m retarded, or what. Don&#39;t close this topic for next week if there will be need of it. Just I really need help with it.</description>
