    <title>The Story Behind Nazi Zombies</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-story-behind-nazi-zombies/291287</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been reading some videos on YouTube about the story of Nazi Zombies, from Verruckt(Asylum, Crazy) to Der Riese(The Giant/Zombie Factory).

In Asylum, two scientists (Richtofer/Unknown) were creating a Wunderwaffe gun, which simply is a wonder gun, I guess you can say &quot;special&quot; gun. These two scientists were creating it because of Anti-Gravity and possible teleportation purposes.

Then an outbreak of zombies occurred (Not sure how, possibly because the scientists were Nazis, and they probably died from the radiation of the power room, and they spawn somewhere. Kind of an ignorant theory, but you may never know). The scientists had to move the experiment to a swamp because of the zombie outbreak. A man mysteriously hung himself in Shi No Numa. Then Demphey(Or whatever his name is, America), Nikolai(Russia), Takeo(Japan), and Richtofen(Nazi Scientist) came to investigate. The man&#39;s left arm was gone, and there was a hand/arm on the switch on the power switch in Verruckt. It could also be Richtofer&#39;s hand, he wears a glove with possibly a fake hand. 

There was a meteor called Tunguska, and it landed around 1930-1940&#39;s. There are many clues on Verruckt about all this information. 

There are 3 radios on Shi No Numa with voices about the experiment. They said something about The Giant(Der Riese). In Verruckt, the numbers &quot;19382406&quot; means &quot;06-24-1938&quot;, or June 24, 1938. That&#39;s probably when the meteor struck(Happened in real life). The Hell Hounds probably touched the meteor and had the power to teleport. The Hell Hounds have the same skin as the meteor, and when they first appear electricity appears, and something(or someone) says &quot;Fetch Me Their Soul&quot;. The meaning why is unknown.  

In the Storage Room, you see the meteor. It has electricity coming out of it, and it&#39;s the exact same electricity on the dogs and also the Wunderwaffe DG-2. The scientists got rocks from the meteor and took it to the Zombie Factory and experimented on the Wunderwaffe DG-2. In Shi No Numa, when you open the door, you see the numbers &quot;115&quot;. It&#39;s an element on the Periodic Table which was used on the meteor and also the Wunderwaffe DG-2. The dogs touched the meteor, and then they got the skin and the electricity. 

Richtofen, the evil scientist who killed people in the Asylum(Verruckt), is a playable character in Shi No Numa. In the Doctor&#39;s Quarters, you hear him talk. I forget what it was. When you shoot the Wunderwaffe DG-2, you hear Richtofen say &quot;Do you hear it? Talking to me?&quot;.

The outbreak of the zombies are unknown. There is no electricity coming out of them, and the skin from the meteor is not on them. They are undead, and the meteor gives out radiation, which may kill a person. Which is why the Hell Hounds are also undead.

When you shoot the meteor, your character says &quot;I wonder that&#39;s why the zombies are here&quot; or something. In Asylum, there is also a hand/arm on the torture chair. Not sure if it&#39;s the hand of Richtofer, who kills people, or the man who is hanging.

In the voice message, I think you hear a man named Peter&#39;s voice, who was trying to deliver the radio message to the man who hung himself. The man did/did not receive the message(It&#39;s unknown). The possible reason why he hung himself was because of the zombie outbreak. 

Richtofer possibly created the Mystery Box. He says during the game or there is a description about him that he collected stuffed animals. There are teddy bears on top of the Mystery Boxes, and randomly, the teddy bear will laugh and they will appear on new boxes, in each of the four corners on Shi No Numa and on upstairs and downstairs in Verruckt. The reasons why the teddy bears laugh is unknown.

I&#39;m not sure what Nacht Der Untoten has to do with the story or not.

More information coming soon. If you believe the information is incorrect, look on YouTube and search &quot;cod waw zombie story&quot;.</description>

              <p>Look at all the epic shiz Nazis made. If only the afghans were a bit more rich/technologically minded; we could make some sexy little weapons to kill eachother with. At the moment we have no reason to though, although a IED/mine sweeper wouldn’t hurt.</p>
<p>On-topic: Who actually cares? I doubt Treyarch thought long and hard about the story behind these zombies. I doubt there is any. The characters and events are just to create a theme between all of the zombie maps. Treyarch fail anyways because their world war two game was so shit they had to make it a zombie game.</p>

True. At least it was a Wunderwaffe. The Tunguska wasn’t the meteor, it was the place the meteor crashed on. The Wunderwaffe weapons were not finished until later on. I’m not 100% sure it was built on ALIEN technology, that’s just Treyarch’s way of giving players a lot of fun(the Ray Gun is the only “Alien” weapon I know of).</p>

I just read it on YouTube; and that information you gave us is incorrect. I’m talking about the game, not WWII. The story why there were Nazi Zombies and why you have to fight to survive.</p>
<p>Here’s an edit: The meteor hit in Tunguska in 1908. The scientists moved the rocks from the meteor in order to research for the Wunderwaffe DG-2. The DG stands for Die Glocke, or “The Bell”.</p>
<p>The zombies happened because the scientists were working on them as an experiment and it went horribly wrong.</p>
<p>The information you gave me was correct, but that’s not even close to the DG. It has so much power. The dogs came from the meteor, but I have no idea how the dogs could’ve touched the meteor. The element 115(Don’t know how to say it) can give you anti-gravity and teleportation. The dogs have teleportation.</p>

Actually, Wunderwaffe guns were used during WWII, and the meteor was actually in the earth’s crust sometime in history, like in 1930’s. That picture is from a fake movie that looks very bloody and gory(saw the previews for it, looks good, but it looks like there is way too much blood, and it’s a lot like in COD5 that when a tank fires, your legs fall off. :\</p>
<p>By the way, the leader looks like Hitler. :o</p>
<p>Der Riese and also Map Pack 3 WILL be amazing.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>I’ve been reading some videos on YouTube about the story of Nazi Zombies, from Verruckt(Asylum, Crazy) to Der Riese(The Giant/Zombie Factory).</p>
<p>In Asylum, two scientists (Richtofer/Unknown) were creating a Wunderwaffe gun, which simply is a wonder gun, I guess you can say “special” gun. These two scientists were creating it because of Anti-Gravity and possible teleportation purposes.</p>
<p>Then an outbreak of zombies occurred (Not sure how, possibly because the scientists were Nazis, and they probably died from the radiation of the power room, and they spawn somewhere. Kind of an ignorant theory, but you may never know). The scientists had to move the experiment to a swamp because of the zombie outbreak. A man mysteriously hung himself in Shi No Numa. Then Demphey(Or whatever his name is, America), Nikolai(Russia), Takeo(Japan), and Richtofen(Nazi Scientist) came to investigate. The man’s left arm was gone, and there was a hand/arm on the switch on the power switch in Verruckt. It could also be Richtofer’s hand, he wears a glove with possibly a fake hand.</p>
<p>There was a meteor called Tunguska, and it landed around 1930-1940’s. There are many clues on Verruckt about all this information.</p>
<p>There are 3 radios on Shi No Numa with voices about the experiment. They said something about The Giant(Der Riese). In Verruckt, the numbers “19382406” means “06-24-1938”, or June 24, 1938. That’s probably when the meteor struck(Happened in real life). The Hell Hounds probably touched the meteor and had the power to teleport. The Hell Hounds have the same skin as the meteor, and when they first appear electricity appears, and something(or someone) says “Fetch Me Their Soul”. The meaning why is unknown.</p>
<p>In the Storage Room, you see the meteor. It has electricity coming out of it, and it’s the exact same electricity on the dogs and also the Wunderwaffe DG-2. The scientists got rocks from the meteor and took it to the Zombie Factory and experimented on the Wunderwaffe DG-2. In Shi No Numa, when you open the door, you see the numbers “115”. It’s an element on the Periodic Table which was used on the meteor and also the Wunderwaffe DG-2. The dogs touched the meteor, and then they got the skin and the electricity.</p>
<p>Richtofen, the evil scientist who killed people in the Asylum(Verruckt), is a playable character in Shi No Numa. In the Doctor’s Quarters, you hear him talk. I forget what it was. When you shoot the Wunderwaffe DG-2, you hear Richtofen say “Do you hear it? Talking to me?”.</p>
<p>The outbreak of the zombies are unknown. There is no electricity coming out of them, and the skin from the meteor is not on them. They are undead, and the meteor gives out radiation, which may kill a person. Which is why the Hell Hounds are also undead.</p>
<p>When you shoot the meteor, your character says “I wonder that’s why the zombies are here” or something. In Asylum, there is also a hand/arm on the torture chair. Not sure if it’s the hand of Richtofer, who kills people, or the man who is hanging.</p>
<p>In the voice message, I think you hear a man named Peter’s voice, who was trying to deliver the radio message to the man who hung himself. The man did/did not receive the message(It’s unknown). The possible reason why he hung himself was because of the zombie outbreak.</p>
<p>Richtofer possibly created the Mystery Box. He says during the game or there is a description about him that he collected stuffed animals. There are teddy bears on top of the Mystery Boxes, and randomly, the teddy bear will laugh and they will appear on new boxes, in each of the four corners on Shi No Numa and on upstairs and downstairs in Verruckt. The reasons why the teddy bears laugh is unknown.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what Nacht Der Untoten has to do with the story or not.</p>
<p>More information coming soon. If you believe the information is incorrect, look on YouTube and search “cod waw zombie story”.</p>
