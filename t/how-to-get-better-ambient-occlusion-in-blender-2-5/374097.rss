    <title>How to get better ambient occlusion in Blender (2.5)</title>

    <description>Ok, so this is pretty much going to be my first &#39;tutorial&#39; i guess.
without further or do..

some of you who use blender may have a constant problem with lighting.
you either have to much lights and light, or not enough. 
in order to get around having to place a lot of lights, there&#39;s ambient occlusion.
now ambient occlusion is a tool that produces ambient light around the scene and determines shadows based
on proximity to other objects.
now in the &#39;World tab, there&#39;s a tab with a little check box and &#39;Ambient occlusion&#39;
check that box. now if you render it out, it&#39;ll look something like this, (except what your scene is. just look at shadows)

you&#39;ll notice that theres A TON of noise in the render.
in order to fix this, go to the &#39;gather&#39; tab (like right under ambient occlusion and EV)
look for the thing that says &#39;samples&#39;. mine was defaulted at 5, yours may be different, but yeah
just crank that number up. between 10-100 should do.

the noise in the image is now reduced. :o

(Done on 16 samples.)

well thats it. i know i didnt go in much detail, but this should suffice.
if you want to learn more, i would recommend you experiment.

(this model is a project im working on. i&#39;m going to fully model a character, and possible rig and animate him and probably make a little amination.
the body piece used in the so called &#39;tutorial&#39; was just a practice model so i got a feel for armor modeling.)</description>
