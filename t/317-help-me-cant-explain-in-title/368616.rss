    <description>ok so my question is...

is it posible to get 1 area doubled in your server?

like some players go into pest control but the others have to wait until that game is done so that area is clear to set up  new game.

i wanne make it that people can go into pest control without having to wait for another game to end.

(if this is posible.... is it possible to do this with other areas aswell?)</description>
