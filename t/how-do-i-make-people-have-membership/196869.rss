    <title>How do I make people have membership?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-make-people-have-membership/196869</link>
    <description>How do I make it so that it will let people (or not let people) have membership on my server? For example:

If a guy had membership, how would I be able to make him have not membership? 

or

If a guy didn&#39;t have membership how could I make him have membership?

Please help me!!!</description>
