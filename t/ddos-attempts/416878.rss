              <p>The reason why certain websites can withstand those DDoS attacks is because they pay several hundred dollars a month for DDoS filtering through Staminus. The bare minimum that they offer costs $250 initial setup fee and $250 a month and that barely does anything when real attacks occur, as we saw with DarkQuest. The best thing to do is stay small, don’t accept donations or charge subscriptions, and try to keep from angering those less mature around us who might spend $10 to rent a botnet for an hour to take out some teenage angst on you.</p>

              <p>Here are some tips from mopar itself (dunno if these still works  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> ) [quote=“Moparisthebest, post:16, topic:317704”]… Also, on the side of the people being attacked, you all know I have been attacked countless times in the past and have always managed to find a way to block it and get around it so it has no effect on the server, there is always a way.  At least learn how to do simple, everyday things like looking at logs, null routing IPs and some simple iptables rules.  With a few minor bash scripting skills you can hack up a script in no time to ban offenders automatically by adding it as a cronjob.</p>
<p>If you request I will help you to the best of my ability to fight off such an attack…[/quote]</p>
