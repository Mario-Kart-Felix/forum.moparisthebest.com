    <title>Marley Headphones microphone not working</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/marley-headphones-microphone-not-working/546027</link>
    <description>I have a House of Marley Positive Vibrations headphones and the microphone works on my pre-built all in one HP computer, but when I try them on my new custom built computer I can only use either the speakers or the microphone separately. On my old HP computer all I needed to do was plug in my single jack into the headphone slot and it would use both speakers and mic, but on my new computer it says one or the other is not plugged in, it depends on what I choose to use when the Realtek HD Audio Manager pops up. 

Any ideas?</description>

<p>But if your female 3.5mm connector is designed for 2 rings (3 knobs), it will not accept the two signals. You’ve never needed one before because obviously on your other machines you’ve had a speaker/mic combo. Most modern laptops come with these combo jacks, while desktop motherboards usually have separate ones.</p>
