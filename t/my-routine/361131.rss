    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-routine/361131</link>
    <description>I was wondering, would drinking a 12 or 16 oz sugar free redbull when I get home at the end of the day help me from being sleepy and tired, so I can get my workout routine going? Would it be bad for my routine, as in unhealthy? Or should I try a 5 hour energy. The thing is when I get back from school all I want to do is sleep, so I get my homework done and sleep. I would really like to finish my homework then workout, but it&#39;s really hard because I don&#39;t eat for 9 hours through the day and get about 7hours of sleep a night. Any tips for not being tired? [Other than coffee]</description>

<p>I’d try to eat as much food as you can for breakfast then try to eat when you get home. I seem to have the opposite problem. I find it hard to get through school because I feel tired. Then when I get home I feel energized and I can get through to 1:00am without feeling tired. I think my biological clock is off, and yours might be off too. Try getting on the routine you want (force yourself to go to sleep later) and your body will start getting used to it.</p>

<p>Whenever I struggle with that I reset my biological clock in a sense. Pull an allnighter, and then go to bed early that night. You’ll wake up refreshed and in a good sleeping pattern.</p>

Because the younger you are the more you sleep. Up until you’re about 20+ you can sleep 10-12 hours a time. But i can go through the day fine with 6 or 5 hours of sleep, depending on how the night went.</p>

You assume way to fucking much. I don’t know if you can fucking read, or you read the parts you can flame about. I don’t eat for 9 hours through the day, and when I get back home I don’t eat much because I have to get to studying, and then I fucking crash. My brain and body are extremely tired by 6:00. I’m sorry to say, but personally I don’t need to hear about what works for you.[/quote]Where the fuck was the assumption in any of what I said? It was a response to your explicit stating of the fact that you sleep 7 hours and you are still tired when you come home. Yes, you don’t eat for 9 hours; obviously that affects your state of energy, but then if you already knew that and are so fucking close minded to other opinions, why the fuck bother posting this thread? And seriously, remind yourself that you are way too new at these forums, and new at using any forums for that matter, since you obviously do not know what the fuck the term “flaming” means since there was no implicit offense implied in the post. But I guess scanning a post with your ass for any potentially offensive terms and then crying flame is just attributed to your helpless moparscaper mentality.</p>

Yeah I’m up at 6:30, at school at 8:00 and don’t get out until 3:00. Then I have to do 2 hours of study when I get home. No breaks but a study hall which I can’t eat in. I’m not able to eat in any of my classes <span class="bbcode-b">except for lunch</span> seeing as it’s against the rules.[/quote]So why don’t you eat at lunch…and/or when you come back from school while allegedly studying. You purposely starve yourself and then bitch about not having energy, fuck off.</p>

Yeah I’ll go speak to my councilor tomorrow to see what I can do. I know it’s require but I said it was fine if I didn’t have it last year for this year. I might have to drop a class to get it and that would severely fuck my gpa for the quarter. Hopefully we can do some schedule shifting with the two study halls I have and we can make it work.</p>

              <p>Yeah you need a lunch break. Do you really study 9 hours a day straight every day?</p>
<p>I’m sure you have a spare 5 minutes here and there throughout the day to cram something down. Being fruit, nuts, rice with fish/chicken etc. I have long and busy days and still eat plenty.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Mr.Chris, post:5, topic:361131”]Mate, I really wouldn’t start working out until you’re eating proper foods and drinking a lot of water. Sure, a Red Bull will give you some quick energy, but not enough to power you through a 1 and a half hour workout.</p>
<p>I say start eating about 5 small meals a day, all of them healthy. Much protein is always good, as well as carbs for some energy. Although, specific foods relate to what you want to achieve. Weight loss? Muscle growth? Both? Also, what you do in your routine is pretty important, in order to get the best results.</p>
<p>Water is pretty important. I try to make sure I’ve always got a bottle of water in my hand, so I drink around 5-7 bottles of water a day. If you don’t drink water much, you’ll see a huge improvement in your energy and mind if that’s all you drink.</p>
<p>IMO, simply having a high sugar energy drink isn’t going to be hugely beneficial + I believe they can mess up your insides if you drink enough of them. Rather than adding a drink, make some changes to your lifestyle and you’ll see quick improvements.</p>
<p>I tend to have around 6-8 hours sleep if I have a busy day, but if I’m having a lazy, do nothing day, I can sleep for 12 hours but then have no energy.</p>
<p>I think the main cause for your exhaustion is lack of the correct foods and drink.[/quote]<br>
You’re probably correct, I just don’t know how to fit lunch into my schedule, seeing as every period of the day I have a class, and when I don’t it’s a study hall period that isn’t a lunch period.</p>

You assume way to fucking much. I don’t know if you can fucking read, or you read the parts you can flame about. I don’t eat for 9 hours through the day, and when I get back home I don’t eat much because I have to get to studying, and then I fucking crash. My brain and body are extremely tired by 6:00. I’m sorry to say, but personally I don’t need to hear about what works for you.</p>
<p>[quote=“Original Daniel, post:3, topic:361131”]You need to eat. That’s why you have no energy.</p>
<p>If you don’t eat for 9 hours then your body is going to start using muscle for energy, rending your workout useless.[/quote]<br>
I was thinking about having a few granola bars through the day. Eating a lot in the morning then having like 3 granola bars until I get home. Would that help if anything?</p>

              <p>I was wondering, would drinking a 12 or 16 oz sugar free redbull when I get home at the end of the day help me from being sleepy and tired, so I can get my workout routine going? Would it be bad for my routine, as in unhealthy? Or should I try a 5 hour energy. The thing is when I get back from school all I want to do is sleep, so I get my homework done and sleep. I would really like to finish my homework then workout, but it’s really hard because I don’t eat for 9 hours through the day and get about 7hours of sleep a night. Any tips for not being tired?
