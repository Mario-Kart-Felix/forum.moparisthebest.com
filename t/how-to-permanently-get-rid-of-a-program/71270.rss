    <title>How to permanently get rid of a program</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-permanently-get-rid-of-a-program/71270</link>
    <description>First of all, install the Unlocker:
http://ccollomb.free.fr/unlocker/unlocker1.8.5.exe
Second of all, install CCleaner:
http://ccleaner.com/download/downloadpage.aspx?1
Third of all, you will need a file you want to delete. I want to delete my AVG 7.5.448 for example. So, I search for &#39;AVG&#39; and &#39;Grisoft&#39; because Grisoft is the company, and everything that shows up, delete it, and use the Unlocker if it is needed.. If your are 100% sure you need it, keep it. Then, head on to your registry, click on &#39;HKEY_CURRENT_USER&#39;, click on &#39;Software&#39;, and since I can&#39;t find something along the lines of &#39;AVG&#39;, I find &#39;Grisoft&#39; and delete it. Then, I head onto &#39;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&#39;, and click on &#39;Sofware&#39;. Again, I can&#39;t find something along the lines of &#39;AVG&#39; so I find &#39;Grisoft&#39;, and delete it. Do the same for &#39;HKEY_USERS&#39; and &#39;HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG&#39;. Sometimes, it won&#39;t be there, so don&#39;t bother re-looking. Now, after that, Open CCleaner, Click on the &#39;Issues&#39; button, click &#39;Scan for Issues&#39;, make sure all of the issues are checked. and after it&#39;s done, click &#39;Fix Selected Issues&#39;, you choose the registry option. Then, on the box that pops up, click &#39;Fix All Issues&#39;. Then, head on to the &#39;Tools&#39; button, and click on the &#39;Uninstall&#39; button is selected, and I find my program there. Go to your task manager, and make sure the program is not running.

If you just delete the file, and you want to re-install it, it will probably say &#39;Repair&#39;, &#39;Uninstall&#39;, or &#39;Remove or Add w/e&#39;. 
This is helpful if you have an anti-virus, and you want to install a new one, because if you install 2 of them, or if you have the anti-virus and the other anti-virus&#39;s history is still on it, it can cause SERIOUS problems.

IMPORTANT:
On &#39;HKEY_USERS&#39;, make sure you check all of the tabs or whatever they are.
They should be:
.Default
S-1-5-18
S-1-5-19
S-1-5-20
S-1-5-21-1713683488-256234271-714284851-1000
S-1-5-21-1713683488-256234271-714284851-1000_Classes

LAST STEP:

Open CCleaner, click on &#39;Cleaner&#39;, click on the &#39;Applications&#39; tab, and make sure the program you want is not there. Anti-Viruses will appear under the &#39;Utilities&#39; section.

Hope this helps.</description>
