    <title>Web management tool or Desktop Application</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/web-management-tool-or-desktop-application/549725</link>
    <description>So, for a game I&#39;m working on, I need to make a content management tool. It would allow you to modify most data aspects of the game (where Npcs are placed, color palettes, other resources, etc). So, I&#39;ve been developing it in Swing (old habits you know). But, it&#39;s really been a pain in the ass. Someone I work with suggested to make it a web app (MVC probably) and just have a web server host it. This sounded like a good idea, but because of the way this game is being written (pluggable, thing of how minecraft works with mods), people would be able to download the game server and host it themselves. By adding a web interface, I&#39;m adding another dependency (web app + web server) to the process of hosting and modifying the server (each plugin could also specify their own editor for plugin-specific changes).

So the question is this; should I write it as a desktop application (in java because all plugins/mods would be written in java) because they would already have the runtime environment, or add another dependency, for the sake of convenience? Is there some middle-ground?</description>

              <p>I would stay away from the web panel unless it was on your server and people signed up to use space/an account, otherwise like you say another dependency and it might be too complicated/time consuming for some people to set up. Of course this means you’d be paying for hosting and shit in order to offer this kind of service <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

<p>It depends. Users will be able to store all data in a flat file, or in a database. The tool will be able to view, create, and modify all data. Server and client side.</p>

There’s literally nothing else it can be used for[/quote]I guess it depends on how broad you want to define a graphical user interface. Technically yes, a website is a GUI, but when you compare webpages (and the HTML/CSS associated with it) to application GUIs (like what Rodger linked) you’d see why CSS and HTML is overkill, because CSS/HTML is a lot about specifically formatting webpages. It’s a markup language with elements designed for webpages. Look at the library Lothy linked, which is designed (also using a markup language) for application graphical user interfaces.</p>

<p>Is a web page not a GUI in a browser? CSS is not just limited to HTML either, it applies to any markup language. For something that has been tested, used, and abused for several years now, you’d think it would be more suitable for more than just web pages considering it has the capabilities.</p>

<p>Just because HTML and CSS have been used for the browsers doesn’t mean they aren’t just as useful in native applications. You don’t need to include every feature that HTML/CSS have (example of this is browser-related elements or rules) yet you would still have a very usable subset of those languages. Webkit for native is exactly what I’m referring to (which solves your interpreter and feature problems).</p>

              <p>At work we use Swing for our software. But, as have been said, Swing is a real pain in the (excuse my language! :)) ass, to create flexible GUI-based applications. We need to provide different layouts for our different customers. We also need to provide different “themes” for the same features. And, not to mention, we need to support different screen resolutions, for different monitors. When we continue, we have thought about updating to JavaFX 8. I looked at JavaFX at the time we started developing this application in 2012, but it wasn’t close to as mature as it is today. It wasn’t even an option at that time. But today it really shines. So I’d suggest that you use it, rather than Swing, if you’re starting today. I know we would. We also plan to replace our Swing-based GUI with it at some point. I hope this information can help you, if not entirely, at least somewhat. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>It’s not particularly difficult, just monotonous and annoying. If you’ve every played Skyrim, or with the Skyrim Creation Kit, that’s the type of interface I have planned, with the added ability of letting the modders create plugins to be injected into it for their custom content. It would be everything from custom models to custom sprites, packet flow diagrams, dialogue options, and packing it to be sent to the players on the next update.</p>

              <p>So, for a game I’m working on, I need to make a content management tool. It would allow you to modify most data aspects of the game (where Npcs are placed, color palettes, other resources, etc). So, I’ve been developing it in Swing (old habits you know). But, it’s really been a pain in the ass. Someone I work with suggested to make it a web app (MVC probably) and just have a web server host it. This sounded like a good idea, but because of the way this game is being written (pluggable, thing of how minecraft works with mods), people would be able to download the game server and host it themselves. By adding a web interface, I’m adding another dependency (web app + web server) to the process of hosting and modifying the server (each plugin could also specify their own editor for plugin-specific changes).</p>
<p>So the question is this; should I write it as a desktop application (in java because all plugins/mods would be written in java) because they would already have the runtime environment, or add another dependency, for the sake of convenience? Is there some middle-ground?</p>
