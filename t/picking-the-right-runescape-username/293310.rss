    <title>Picking the right runescape username</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/picking-the-right-runescape-username/293310</link>
    <description>In runescape, you need to pick a username, but you want  a good one..? one that will stick out....well heres some ideas and stuff about usernames i have fetched out for you.



Username in runescape: A username in runescape is the name of a players character within &quot;runescape&quot;.


                                                     THE LIMITATIONS INTO PICKING A RUNESCAPE USERNAME

Usernames cannot be created if an identical one exists, even if it is permanently banned. 
Usernames must be between 1 and 12 characters long. 
Usernames may only contain alphanumeric characters and the space. Any other characters are replaced with a space. 
Usernames cannot start with or end with a space, but can have any number of spaces between. 
Usernames cannot contain one of several phrases including Java, Mod, jagex, etc. 
Usernames cannot contain anything offensive such as inappropriate words or curse words. 
A finite amount of usernames can be created per IP before the action is throttled


                                      choosing an APPROPRIATE username.
In addition to the technical limitations of choosing a username, Jagex&#39;s terms and conditions place some restrictions on what players are permitted to call themselves. These state that players &quot;must not choose a username that infringes the rights of any third party, impersonates Jagex staff or other users, which is deliberately confusing or which is offensive, racist, obscene, hurtful, unlawful or otherwise inappropriate or which breaches the username requirements specified on our site or our Rules of Conduct&quot;               
&quot;Usernames can be a maximum of 12 characters long and may contain letters, numbers and underscores... When playing RuneScape, underscores in usernames are translated into spaces and first letters are capitalised. For example the username red_rooster would appear as Red Rooster.&quot; 
&quot;It should not contain your real name, birth date, or other personally identifiable information, to better protect your identity.&quot; Some users choose to spell their real name backwards to form a username; this is certainly not recommended, since it is easy to guess. 
&quot;It should not be offensive or break our Terms+Conditions&quot;. Usernames are not censored by the chat filter, so it is possible for players to choose a username that is inappropriate. However, accounts can be banned for having an overtly offensive username. Players are not warned if they try to create an account with a username that activates the chat filter, and consequently genuine players may find that they cannot say their own (inoffensive) username in-game without at least part of it being censored. This does not mean that they are in danger of being banned, but simply that the chat filter has detected something as being potentially offensive when it is not. Members and eligible free players can post on the &quot;Feedback About The Censor&quot; sticky in the RuneScape Forums if they wish to bring their specific plight to Jagex&#39;s attention


                                                            Sensible Usernames



Deciding on a suitable username is more important to some players than to others, and what makes a good username is likewise different for everyone. However, some guidelines may be helpful. 

It may be sensible for players to choose a username that appears to be a genuine name, so that other players can address them in a meaningful way. In practice, very few players choose to do this. Those who do may prefer to choose a unisex name, because they can freely change their character&#39;s gender in-game, and they may wish to have a name that is appropriate either way. 

Some clans prefer members to have a reference to the clan in their names. However, this gives no flexibility for players who later wish to change the name or the activities for their clan, or join a different clan altogether. 





                                                         Some ideas


                                                               Many of the more obvious usernames have been taken. Ideas of usernames may come from any of the following: 

Characters from books, TV series, video games, etc. Since many of these will be taken, combining two names together (with or without a space) may prove useful. 
Characteristics of what the player expects to be doing. For example, combat-heavy characters may have &quot;pk&quot; (short for player killer) in their name, or reference to the Wilderness. The drawback with this is that the game can change - for example, player-killing and the wilderness changed with the Wilderness Changes, Bounty Hunter and Clan Wars update of the 10 December 2007. Additionally, players&#39; own goals and interests can evolve. 
Some usernames may consist of leet to form the names of famous players. 






                                                         uniqe usernames
                                                           Ideas for how to enhance a chosen name, in order to make it unique, especially if it is taken, may be necessary. These can include: 

Adding numbers to the end of the preferred username; some players are satisfied with this, others are not. 
A prefix that suggests power, such as Lord. Other prefixes derived from Greek, Latin or other languages may be used, including Super, Hyper, Ultra, Omni or Uber. 
Using numbers as letters such as 3=e or 4=a or 7=t






I hope this guide, &quot;picking the right runescape username&quot; helps you into...picking the right runescape username...
