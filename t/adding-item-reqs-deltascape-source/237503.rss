    <title>Adding Item Req&#39;s ~ DeltaScape Source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-item-reqs-deltascape-source/237503</link>
    <description>Alright, well I know the it has to deal with CLAttack, etc. But on my source I&#39;m not sure how the code goes, and I believe it goes into client.java such as other sources from TuT&#39;s I&#39;ve seen, but none of them really helped me. I know this is a nooby question but any help please? Thanks.
