Anyone watching the new TV show Heroes?  I think its Amazing!


[b]About:[/b]

Heroes is all about &quot;Ordinary people discovering extraordinary abilities.&quot;  It goes on the line of mutations in genes leading to people who have super powers.  The show follows about 12 different characters, all in their separate live, but slowly intertwine together to show them that together they can save the world.


[b]Main Cast:[/b]

[img]http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/images/cast/cast_mohinder.jpg[/img]
At the beginning of the Series, we meet one of the main characters: [i]Mohinder Suresh[/i] who has just lost his father.  He has travelled to New York to find out why his father was killed, and to hopefully finished what he started: researching Genetic Mutations which could potentially give people extraordinary abilities.

[img]http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/images/cast/cast_claire.jpg[/img]
We then meet Claire Bennett - A cheerleader who has the rapid regeneration mutation gene meaning that it is very hard to kill her.  Evertime she breaks a bone, she pushes it back into place, wipes the blood away and walks away.

Niki Saunders is a woman with an alterego.  whenever someone tries attacking her, her alterego comes out and protects her.  However Niki&#39;s alterego is violent and will stop at nothing to get the job done.

Isaac Mendez can pain the future - but only when hes high.  As he injects heroine into his blood stream, something else takes over and when he wakes up, the masterpieces he has painted when he was high show the future.

Every good show needs a crazy, time and space continuum bending Japanese guy.  So we introduce Hiro Nakamura.  By travelling through time, he can see the future, and change the past.

[img]http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/images/cast/cast_nathan.jpg[/img]
Nathan Petrelli - Running of an election, Nathan is struggling to keep his mutation a secret, and doesn&#39;t reveal it to his brother until it is needed.  Nathan has the ability of flight.

[img]http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/images/cast/cast_peter.jpg[/img]
Peter Petrelli - Nathan&#39;s brother is unsure of his powers.  Only until later on in the show does he realise that he can absorb other peoples powers when the are close to him

[img]http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/images/cast/cast_matt.jpg[/img]
Matt Parkman works for the police and is a mind reader.  however, as he finds out, when reading minds, you can come across some information you may not want.


[b]The Storyline:[/b]

We start with Mohinder introducing us to genetics, and carrying on his fathers work.  Even though Mohinder doesn&#39;t show a power, he is vital to the storyline, as it is by him that many of the characters link up.  We then meet Claire, the indestructable cheerleader, and Hiro, the time and space continuum bending japanese.

As Hiro is testing his powers, he accidentally transports himself 5 weeks into the future only to see a huge nuclear bomb wipe out New York City.  He transports himself back and makes it his mission to save the world, but doesn&#39;t know where to start.  Eventually he meets up with Isaac, the guy who can paint the future when he is high.  He paints storyboards of what is going to happen within those 5 weeks and what all of the different Characters have to do to try to stop this.

Whilst all of this is happening, Matt (The mind reader) finds out of a villian named Syler who is massacring people violently and the sucking their powers.  The story continues, with the strapline morphing from &quot;Ordinary people discovering extraordinary abilities&quot; to &quot;Save the Cheerleader, Save the World&quot;

At the end of the last episode, one of the main characters died, and huge twist in the tale was revealed.
A lot more happens in the show, with many more of the characters meeting each other, and all finding out in their own ways that they have to save the world from this nuclear explosion



I strongly suggest you guys watch this show, it really is addictive and great to watch.  I cant wait until the next episode is released so i can continue to find out what is happening!

[Quote=Wikipedia]When the series premiered in the United States, it was the night&#39;s most-watched program among adults 18-49, attracting 14.3 million viewers overall and receiving the highest rating for any NBC drama premiere in five years[/Quote]

<p><img src="http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/images/cast/cast_mohinder.jpg" alt width="" height=""><br>
At the beginning of the Series, we meet one of the main characters: <span class="bbcode-i">Mohinder Suresh</span> who has just lost his father.  He has travelled to New York to find out why his father was killed, and to hopefully finished what he started: researching Genetic Mutations which could potentially give people extraordinary abilities.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/images/cast/cast_claire.jpg" alt width="" height=""><br>
We then meet Claire Bennett - A cheerleader who has the rapid regeneration mutation gene meaning that it is very hard to kill her.  Evertime she breaks a bone, she pushes it back into place, wipes the blood away and walks away.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/images/cast/cast_niki.jpg" alt width="" height=""><br>

Isaac Mendez can pain the future - but only when hes high.  As he injects heroine into his blood stream, something else takes over and when he wakes up, the masterpieces he has painted when he was high show the future.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/images/cast/cast_hiro.jpg" alt width="" height=""><br>
Every good show needs a crazy, time and space continuum bending Japanese guy.  So we introduce Hiro Nakamura.  By travelling through time, he can see the future, and change the past.</p>

Nathan Petrelli - Running of an election, Nathan is struggling to keep his mutation a secret, and doesn’t reveal it to his brother until it is needed.  Nathan has the ability of flight.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">The Storyline:</span></p>
<p>We start with Mohinder introducing us to genetics, and carrying on his fathers work.  Even though Mohinder doesn’t show a power, he is vital to the storyline, as it is by him that many of the characters link up.  We then meet Claire, the indestructable cheerleader, and Hiro, the time and space continuum bending japanese.</p>
<p>As Hiro is testing his powers, he accidentally transports himself 5 weeks into the future only to see a huge nuclear bomb wipe out New York City.  He transports himself back and makes it his mission to save the world, but doesn’t know where to start.  Eventually he meets up with Isaac, the guy who can paint the future when he is high.  He paints storyboards of what is going to happen within those 5 weeks and what all of the different Characters have to do to try to stop this.</p>
<p>Whilst all of this is happening, Matt (The mind reader) finds out of a villian named Syler who is massacring people violently and the sucking their powers.  The story continues, with the strapline morphing from “Ordinary people discovering extraordinary abilities” to “Save the Cheerleader, Save the World”</p>
<p>At the end of the last episode, one of the main characters died, and huge twist in the tale was revealed.<br>
A lot more happens in the show, with many more of the characters meeting each other, and all finding out in their own ways that they have to save the world from this nuclear explosion</p>
<p>I strongly suggest you guys watch this show, it really is addictive and great to watch.  I cant wait until the next episode is released so i can continue to find out what is happening!</p>
