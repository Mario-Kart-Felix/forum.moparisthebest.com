Why is Jbirdscape coming back?[/b]
I am bringing Jbirdscape back for a couple of reasons. One is because I keep getting hacked on runescape, lost over 250m last hack and it&#39;s getting annoying when you keep loosing all you have. So I decided to quit runescape and just start playing Jbirdscape again!

[b]About Jbirdscape (Remodeling)[/b]
One we need to test out if players can log in and out of Jbirdscape, currently no one can just going to get about 2-3 players to edit it up with me to test it out so we can get Jbirdscape back. If you really want to get Jbirdscape back then you will volunteer and come and help, also I have a better computer now I&#39;m sure the server will hold many more players.
I will be telling you when it is up!
