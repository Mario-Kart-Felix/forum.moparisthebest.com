    <title>Friend can not connect to my 508 server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/friend-can-not-connect-to-my-508-server/257468</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not sure if it is a problem with his client, as he had to go right after he installed everything and tested, but I was wondering what possible problems there was to be had. Before you ask, I have a No-IP redirect, and have port 43594 forwarded. It would also be great if someone was willing to PM me to try and connect to see if it&#39;s just him that I need to fix. Thanks much in advance. Rep will be given.</description>
