&lt;blockquote&gt;Capricornus Rex in tenebris
I long to feel the dark caress
Of your cloven hooves;
I seek the loving warmth of your anus
As I place my worshipful
Lips about your teats.

We hate, and so we gather
By the light of the moon;
The art of veneficium...
This we learned from you...
To make them grieve in their lord,
Their redeemer in flames
Fanned by the scorn of the children
Who now curse his name.

Sire of sin,
You embody me
Undivine...
To you we congregate;
None so vile,
Your magnificent
Crown of horns
Inspires deeds maleficent.

Destroy the parasite,
Destroy Jesus Christ.

They&#39;ll crawl in their perdition,
The righteous will be lost
Where gutted angels lie fucked...
Beneath the feunral cross;
We&#39;ll dig them a mass grave soon,
And bring to their knees
Those who would have rescinded
The laws of disease.

&quot;The children have turned&quot;,
The cherubs wail,
As anticross triumphs
Where the cross has failed.

Hell-spawned majesty, we eagerly
Await the advent of the
Next millennium
When you will return with a swarm from
Beyond to claim your carnal
Lost dominion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

              <blockquote>You're in for surprise
You're in for a shock
In London town streets
When there's darkness and fog
When you least expect me
And you turn your back
I'll attack
<p>I smile when I’m sneaking<br>
Through shadows by the wall<br>
I laugh when I’m creeping<br>
But you won’t hear me at all</p>
<p>All hear my warning<br>
Never turn your back<br>
On the ripper</p>
<p>You’ll soon shake with fear<br>
Never knowing if I’m near<br>
I’m sly and I’m shameless<br>
Nocturnal and nameless<br>
Except for “The Ripper”<br>
Or if you like “Jack The Knife”</p>
<p>Any back alley street<br>
Is where we’ll probably meet<br>
Underneath a gas lamp<br>
Where the air’s cold and damp<br>
I’m a nasty surprise<br>
I’m a devil in disguise<br>
I’m a footstep at night<br>
I’m a scream of the fright</p>
<p>All hear my warning<br>
Never turn your back<br>
On the ripper, the ripper, the ripper</p>

When I get older, I will be stronger They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag And then it goes back, and then it goes back And then it goes back, oh
Born to a throne, stronger than Rome A violent prone, poor people zone But it's my home, all I have known Where I got grown, streets we would roam
Out of the darkness, I came the farthest Among the hardest survival Learn from these streets, it can be bleak Accept no defeat, surrender, retreat
So we struggling, fighting to eat And we wondering when we'll be free So we patiently wait for that fateful day It's not far away, but for now we say
When I get older I will be stronger They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag And then it goes back, and then it goes back And then it goes back, oh
So many wars, settling scores Bringing us promises, leaving us poor I heard them say 'love is the way' 'Love is the answer,' that's what they say
But look how they treat us, make us believers We fight their battles, then they deceive us Try to control us, they couldn't hold us 'Cause we just move forward like Buffalo Soldiers
But we struggling, fighting to eat And we wondering, when we'll be free So we patiently wait for that faithful day It's not far away but for now we say
When I get older I will be stronger They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag And then it goes back, and then it goes back And then it goes back, and then is goes
When I get older I will be stronger They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag And then it goes back, and then it goes back And then it goes back, and then it goes And then it goes
And everybody will be singing it And you and I will be singing it And we all will be singing it
When I get older I will be stronger They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag And then it goes back, and then it goes back And then it goes back, and then it goes
When I get older I will be stronger They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag And then it goes back, and then it goes back And then it goes back, oh
When I get older, when I get older I will be stronger just like a wavin' flag Just like a wavin' flag, just like a wavin' flag Flag, flag, just like a wavin' flag</blockquote>

Tell a bitch, that she better bring her friend<br>
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen<br>
Yeah the party never ends, this life is what I recommend<br>
And if you got a hoe before me, then she better be a 10<br>

<p>No…  that’s because you look in the wrong freaking place.</p>
<p>if you listen to some of the rappers full album, or find one of their good albums, then you’ll see they aren’t posers</p>
<p>prob not the best example… since he is dead and is not mentioned so much now a days…<br>
Tupac Shakur</p>
<blockquote>When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school; and scared to go home, I was a fool
with the big boys, breakin all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame mama
I reminice on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary?
Heeey! I see the penitentiary, one day
And runnin from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand
for a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how ya did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
<p>[Chorus: Reggie Green &amp; “Sweet Franklin” w/ 2Pac]</p>
<p>Lady…<br>
Don’t cha know we love ya? Sweet lady<br>
Dear mama<br>
Place no one above ya, sweet lady<br>
You are appreciated<br>
Don’t cha know we love ya?</p>
<p>[second and third chorus, “And dear mama” instead of “Dear mama”]</p>
<p>[Verse Two: 2Pac]</p>
<p>Now ain’t nobody tell us it was fair<br>
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn’t there<br>
He passed away and I didn’t cry, cause my anger<br>
wouldn’t let me feel for a stranger<br>
They say I’m wrong and I’m heartless, but all along<br>
I was lookin for a father he was gone<br>
I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs<br>
They showed a young brother love<br>
I moved out and started really hangin<br>
I needed money of my own so I started slangin<br>
I ain’t guilty cause, even though I sell rocks<br>
It feels good puttin money in your mailbox<br>
I love payin rent when the rent’s due<br>
I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you<br>
Cause when I was low you was there for me<br>
And never left me alone because you cared for me<br>
And I could see you comin home after work late<br>
You’re in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate<br>
Ya just workin with the scraps you was given<br>
And mama made miracles every Thanksgivin<br>
But now the road got rough, you’re alone<br>
You’re tryin to raise two bad kids on your own<br>
And there’s no way I can pay you back<br>
But my plan is to show you that I understand<br>
You are appreciated</p>
<p>[Chorus]</p>
<p>[Verse Three: 2Pac]</p>
<p>Pour out some liquor and I reminsce, cause through the drama<br>
I can always depend on my mama<br>
And when it seems that I’m hopeless<br>
You say the words that can get me back in focus<br>
When I was sick as a little kid<br>
To keep me happy there’s no limit to the things you did<br>
And all my childhood memories<br>
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me<br>
And even though I act craaazy<br>
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me<br>
There are no words that can express how I feel<br>
You never kept a secret, always stayed real<br>
And I appreciate, how you raised me<br>
And all the extra love that you gave me<br>
I wish I could take the pain away<br>
If you can make it through the night there’s a brighter day<br>
Everything will be alright if ya hold on<br>
It’s a struggle everyday, gotta roll on<br>
And there’s no way I can pay you back<br>
But my plan is to show you that I understand<br>
You are appreciated</p>
<p>[Chorus]</p>
<p>Sweet lady<br>
And dear mama</p>
<p>Dear mama<br>
Lady [3X]</p>

uh, how about most mainstream musicians are poseurs… also, lyrics aren’t everything. however, in rap all there is is lyrics, everything else is a simple rhythm or synth, so… that sort of forces the quality of the music to be completely derived from the lyrics.</p>

Meanlingless lyrics that don’t pertain to there life at all while with hip hop (not talking about the songs like nigga nigga nigga nigga) like gucci they actually have catchy lines and talks about there life and has a mellow beat, just thought I’d point that out so we all don’t assume rap is just a bunch of gorrillaz talking about drive bys and doing drugs.</p>

<blockquote>Ashes and promises share a bond
Through the winds of change
Words are blown away
When visions that should be
Are tattooed in your mind
The power to let go
Is sometimes hard to find
<p>The answer cannot be found<br>
In the writing of others<br>
Or the words of a trained mind<br>
In a precious world of memories<br>
We find ourselves confined</p>
<p>Claws so razor sharp<br>
Ripping at the spirit</p>
<p>Promises a potential to hurt<br>
Is anything real?<br>
When forever is to be until<br>
Deep inside, in the world of empty words…<br>
No escaping from those haunting<br>
Empty words…</p>
<p>Do you ever feel it?<br>
A craving that is so strong<br>
To by thought rewind in order to find</p>
<p>Expectations that shined through the doubt<br>
That soon would turn into the price<br>
Of what a word will be worth<br>
When tomorrow comes<br>
To be and we are left<br>
Standing on our own-<br>
And seeing what is real…</p>
<p>The answer cannot be found<br>

<blockquote>In better days I've been known to listen
I go to waste all my time is missing
<p>I’m mapping out my ending,<br>
it’s never gonna happen now<br>
These things are condescending<br>
with everybody backing down</p>
<p>You pray to stars that can help you get by<br>
And all at once you forget to try</p>
<p>I’d go there if you let me,<br>
they’re never gonna find me now<br>
My life is always empty<br>
and in and out of doubt</p>
<p>You’re not coming back for me, these things they will never be<br>
I’m so used to being wrong, so put me where I belong</p>
<p>I’ll get back to you,<br>
God knows I try,<br>
but I still lose<br>
And I get back to you,<br>
these days run by,<br>
but I still lose</p>
<p>Angels say they can make you suffer<br>
They give and take like a vicious lover</p>
<p>When all this loses meaning,<br>
You’ll never want it back somehow<br>
Awake but still I’m dreaming<br>
And never waking up</p>
<p>Alone…Where I’m not alone</p>

Hello, Mr. Cox
You ready to sing one?
I'm always ready
Alright
<p>In my dreams you’re blowing me some kisses<br>
That’s one of my favorite things to do<br>
You and I could go down in history<br>
That’s what I’m planning to do with you</p>
<p>Let’s duet in ways that make us feel good<br>
Let’s duet and make that sacred sound<br>
Put two and two together, perfect harmony we found<br>
We know it’s only natural, let’s duet</p>
<p>I’m going to beat off all my demons<br>
That’s what loving Jesus all about<br>
Looking in your eyes, I start believing<br>
Let’s bring this whisper to a shout</p>
<p>Let’s duet in ways that make us feel good<br>
Let’s duet and make that sacred sound<br>
Put two and two together, perfect harmony we’ve found<br>
We know it’s only natural, let’s duet</p>
<p>Better hear your siren, what are you implying?<br>
Look a little tired, the music got me wired<br>
Pretty good looking, boy, I’m really cooking now</p>
<p>I just want to make out what you’re saying<br>
Read my lips, it’s what you are looking for<br>
Here I am, sneaking up behind you<br>
You can always come in my back door</p>
<p>Let’s duet in ways that make us feel good<br>
Let’s duet and make that sacred sound<br>
Put two and two together, perfect harmony we’ve found<br>
We know it’s only natural, a [Incomprehensible] in natural<br>
God knows it’s only natural, let’s duet</p>

<p>There was a house in a field on the side of a cliff<br>
And the waves crashing below were just said to be a myth<br>
So they ignore the warnings from the ships in the docks<br>
Now the house on the cliff is the wreckage on the rocks<br>
Nothing can fix the building’s flawed foundation<br>
The scaffolding and stilts were the laws and legislation<br>
This house was doomed, but they didn’t care<br>
They’d invested in the system that was beyond repair</p>
<p>When I was little<br>
I dressed up as an astronaut, and explored outer-space<br>
I dressed up as a superhero, and ran about the place<br>
I dressed up as a fireman, and rescued those in need<br>
I dressed up as a doctor, and cured every disease</p>
<p>It was crystal clear to me back then that the only problems that I could<br>
Face<br>
Would be the same problems that affect us all<br>
But of course this sense of common existence was sucked out of me in an<br>
Instance<br>
As if from birth I could walk but I was forced to crawl</p>
<p>So this an exciting time, to be alive<br>
Our generation’s gotta fight, to survive<br>
It’s in your hands now, there’s no time<br>
Our future, Our future</p>

<p>[Quote]<br>
If there really is a big fluffy Jesus in the clouds let him know right now that I take it all back<br>
If there really is a muscular, cackling, red devil in the ground, you should tell him save me a shack<br>
But since I never saw either at my local Walmart shopping yelling at their kids in front of my optics<br>
I’ve been operating under the premise that neither existed because I base my beliefs in logic<br>
But if it’s really true would you say when my body is in the ground<br>
I’ll either float on up or drop right down<br>
Then I’m nervous for the verdict<br>
As a person I’m imperfect<br>
Ive been doing dirt lurking in the gutter with the vermin<br>
I dont deserve to go north when I’m gone glim finished rivers swan shaped bongs<br>
Some big tittied angels floating over ponds<br>
Singing songs more soothing than bed, bath, and beyond<br>
No, I deserve my skin scorched, skies made of skulls<br>
Sasquatch is made of fire as I fall into a gulch everything black<br>
I’d give my left nut and my dick for the chance to go back</p>
<p>You and I both know I can’t shut my mouth<br>
But before you blow my candle out<br>
Would you please just listen to me here right now?<br>
Before you blow my candle out<br>
Cause if I had a second time around, I would turn it all around</p>
<p>Man thats what they all say, you’re done<br>
No, no, no, no, shut the fuck up and listen for once cause i’ve been sitting on your shoulder<br>
As you’ve grown colder<br>
All of these years yelling in your ear<br>
But you wouldn’t hear<br>
You had another plan, too big for little me<br>
Let me put it in a rap simile<br>
You’ll understand, I gave you a fair shake<br>
Kind of like a ferris wheel, during a earthquake<br>
Get it? like you did it when you had it couldn’t get it locked down<br>
No dont bother with a frown<br>
You were healthy in the mental<br>
Potential with the pencil<br>
Could’ve just filled in the stencil<br>
But you’re tempted by the devil<br>
Content to just to settle get a bronze medal<br>
You laid your picnic in the wrong meadow<br>
Cause now you’re trembling and mumbling defending what you’ve done to him you took the low road, there’s a toll booth coming! and guess whose in the booth? man, not I<br>
It’s the one that the burglars are meeting when they die<br>
And the murders and neighborhood circlers guy<br>
It’s not a piece of cake if you want a piece of the pie<br>
So i’ll have dinner with the winners<br>
While you simmer with the sinners<br>
Turn your summers into winters<br>
What a bummer you can whimper<br>
You could’ve been a star just a glimmer<br>
Now let me blow your candle out and make it dimmer</p>
<p>Chorus</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen of the congregation we are here today to celebrate the loss of a demon, Peter Sparker<br>
And may he never live again a scourge on this earth may our children never repeat his mistakes (hallelujah)<br>
And may he burn eternally</p>
<p>What do you want me to do? you fucking sorry excuse you dug your own hole lying and dude<br>
No, no, no, that apology is cute<br>
But all will be through<br>
I’ll blow your candle like the chances you blew<br>
Yea, you had some moments in the ratings<br>
But then you’d always go skulking in the shade again<br>
You disappointed your family shamed friends<br>
I got a list heres the order of my list that it’s in<br>
, it goes your daughter, your mother, your girl, your brother, jeff, cam, matt, your father, sister, and some others<br>
So while you wither like Bill your little life will be forgotten while you’re rotting wikipedia pages<br>
They will be fading<br>
While you’re waiting<br>
For a pardon from this run-on sentence unpunctuated arson while you stand there<br>
Bare your closet full of skeletons dancing like the flames on your hair<br>
Hey dont be like em all spose you’re your own foes make this bed of coals you can go to sleep there[/quote]</p>
