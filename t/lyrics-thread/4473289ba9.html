<p>[Tha Producer:]<br>
Take my hand lets go,<br>
Somewhere we can rest our souls.<br>
We’ll sit where it’s warm,<br>
You say look we’re here alone.</p>
<p>[Chorus:]<br>
I was running in circles,<br>
I hurt myself,<br>
Just to find my purpose.</p>
<p>Everything was so worthless,<br>
I didn’t deserve this,<br>
But to me you were perfect.</p>
<p>I’m scattered through this life.<br>
If this is life I’ll say good bye.</p>
<p>She’s gone like an angel,<br>
With wings let me burn tonight.</p>
<p>[Chorus]<br>
I was running in circles<br>
I hurt myself,<br>
Just to find my purpose.</p>
<p>Everything was so worthless,<br>
I didn’t deserve this,<br>
But to me you were perfect.</p>
<p>[Johnny 3:]<br>
I see me writin on this paper.<br>
Prayin for some savior.</p>
<p>In a world so, so godless. so thoughtless,<br>
I don’t know how we wrought this,<br>
All the love that you brought us.</p>
<p>It feels like I’m killin myself.<br>
Just willing myself.<br>
Just to pray for some help.</p>
<p>I’d give it all just to have, have your eternity.<br>
Cause it’s all that assures me.<br>
It’s worth all that hurts me.</p>
<p>I’d give you my heart,<br>
And let you just hold it.<br>
I’d give you my soul,<br>
But I already sold it.</p>
<p>On that day<br>
That day I walked away in December.<br>
I will always remember.<br>
I’ll regret it forever.</p>
<p>I remember brown eyes,<br>
So sad and blue skies.<br>
Turned to darkness and night.<br>
I’m so sick of the fight.</p>
<p>I won’t breathe unless you breathe,<br>
Won’t bleed unless you bleed.<br>
Won’t be unless you be,<br>
'Till I’m gone and I can sleep.</p>
<p>[Chorus]<br>
I was running in circles<br>
I hurt myself,<br>
Just to find my purpose.</p>
<p>Everything was so worthless,<br>
I didn’t deserve this,<br>
But to me you were perfect.</p>
<p>[Tha Producer:]<br>
I’ve gone away,<br>
Seen better times in yesterday (I hurt myself).<br>
It’s hard to say,<br>
That everything will be okay (I hurt myself).</p>
<p>I’ve gone away,<br>
Seen better times in yesterday (I hurt myself).<br>

<blockquote>I don't mean to dwell
But I can't help myself
When I feel the vibe
And taste a memory
Of a time in life
When years seemed to stand still
<p>I close my eyes<br>
And sink within myself<br>
Relive the gift of precious memories<br>
In need of a fix called innocence</p>
<p>When did it begin?<br>
The change to come was undetectable<br>
The open wounds expose the importance of<br>
Our innocence<br>
A high that can never be bought or sold</p>
<p>Symbolic acts - so vivid<br>
Yet at the same time<br>
We’re invisible</p>
<p>Savor what you feel and what you see<br>
Things that may not seem important now<br>
But may be tomorrow</p>
<p>Do you remember when<br>
Things seemed so eternal?<br>
Heroes were so real…<br>
Their magic frozen in time<br>
The only way to learn<br>
Is be aware and hold on tight</p>
<p>I close my eyes<br>
And sink within myself<br>
Relive the gift of precious memories<br>
In need of a fix called innocence</p>
<p>When did it begin?<br>
The change to come was undetectable<br>
The open wounds expose the importance of<br>
Our innocence<br>
A high that can never be bought or sold</p>

<p>There was a house in a field on the side of a cliff<br>
And the waves crashing below were just said to be a myth<br>
So they ignore the warnings from the ships in the docks<br>
Now the house on the cliff is the wreckage on the rocks<br>
Nothing can fix the building’s flawed foundation<br>
The scaffolding and stilts were the laws and legislation<br>
This house was doomed, but they didn’t care<br>
They’d invested in the system that was beyond repair</p>
<p>When I was little<br>
I dressed up as an astronaut, and explored outer-space<br>
I dressed up as a superhero, and ran about the place<br>
I dressed up as a fireman, and rescued those in need<br>
I dressed up as a doctor, and cured every disease</p>
<p>It was crystal clear to me back then that the only problems that I could<br>
Face<br>
Would be the same problems that affect us all<br>
But of course this sense of common existence was sucked out of me in an<br>
Instance<br>
As if from birth I could walk but I was forced to crawl</p>
<p>So this an exciting time, to be alive<br>
Our generation’s gotta fight, to survive<br>
It’s in your hands now, there’s no time<br>
Our future, Our future</p>

<p>[Quote]<br>
If there really is a big fluffy Jesus in the clouds let him know right now that I take it all back<br>
If there really is a muscular, cackling, red devil in the ground, you should tell him save me a shack<br>
But since I never saw either at my local Walmart shopping yelling at their kids in front of my optics<br>
I’ve been operating under the premise that neither existed because I base my beliefs in logic<br>
But if it’s really true would you say when my body is in the ground<br>
I’ll either float on up or drop right down<br>
Then I’m nervous for the verdict<br>
As a person I’m imperfect<br>
Ive been doing dirt lurking in the gutter with the vermin<br>
I dont deserve to go north when I’m gone glim finished rivers swan shaped bongs<br>
Some big tittied angels floating over ponds<br>
Singing songs more soothing than bed, bath, and beyond<br>
No, I deserve my skin scorched, skies made of skulls<br>
Sasquatch is made of fire as I fall into a gulch everything black<br>
I’d give my left nut and my dick for the chance to go back</p>
<p>You and I both know I can’t shut my mouth<br>
But before you blow my candle out<br>
Would you please just listen to me here right now?<br>
Before you blow my candle out<br>
Cause if I had a second time around, I would turn it all around</p>
<p>Man thats what they all say, you’re done<br>
No, no, no, no, shut the fuck up and listen for once cause i’ve been sitting on your shoulder<br>
As you’ve grown colder<br>
All of these years yelling in your ear<br>
But you wouldn’t hear<br>
You had another plan, too big for little me<br>
Let me put it in a rap simile<br>
You’ll understand, I gave you a fair shake<br>
Kind of like a ferris wheel, during a earthquake<br>
Get it? like you did it when you had it couldn’t get it locked down<br>
No dont bother with a frown<br>
You were healthy in the mental<br>
Potential with the pencil<br>
Could’ve just filled in the stencil<br>
But you’re tempted by the devil<br>
Content to just to settle get a bronze medal<br>
You laid your picnic in the wrong meadow<br>
Cause now you’re trembling and mumbling defending what you’ve done to him you took the low road, there’s a toll booth coming! and guess whose in the booth? man, not I<br>
It’s the one that the burglars are meeting when they die<br>
And the murders and neighborhood circlers guy<br>
It’s not a piece of cake if you want a piece of the pie<br>
So i’ll have dinner with the winners<br>
While you simmer with the sinners<br>
Turn your summers into winters<br>
What a bummer you can whimper<br>
You could’ve been a star just a glimmer<br>
Now let me blow your candle out and make it dimmer</p>
<p>Chorus</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen of the congregation we are here today to celebrate the loss of a demon, Peter Sparker<br>
And may he never live again a scourge on this earth may our children never repeat his mistakes (hallelujah)<br>
And may he burn eternally</p>
<p>What do you want me to do? you fucking sorry excuse you dug your own hole lying and dude<br>
No, no, no, that apology is cute<br>
But all will be through<br>
I’ll blow your candle like the chances you blew<br>
Yea, you had some moments in the ratings<br>
But then you’d always go skulking in the shade again<br>
You disappointed your family shamed friends<br>
I got a list heres the order of my list that it’s in<br>
, it goes your daughter, your mother, your girl, your brother, jeff, cam, matt, your father, sister, and some others<br>
So while you wither like Bill your little life will be forgotten while you’re rotting wikipedia pages<br>
They will be fading<br>
While you’re waiting<br>
For a pardon from this run-on sentence unpunctuated arson while you stand there<br>
Bare your closet full of skeletons dancing like the flames on your hair<br>
Hey dont be like em all spose you’re your own foes make this bed of coals you can go to sleep there[/quote]</p>

<blockquote>Hello, darling
Hello, Mr. Cox
You ready to sing one?
I'm always ready
Alright
<p>In my dreams you’re blowing me some kisses<br>
That’s one of my favorite things to do<br>
You and I could go down in history<br>
That’s what I’m planning to do with you</p>
<p>Let’s duet in ways that make us feel good<br>
Let’s duet and make that sacred sound<br>
Put two and two together, perfect harmony we found<br>
We know it’s only natural, let’s duet</p>
<p>I’m going to beat off all my demons<br>
That’s what loving Jesus all about<br>
Looking in your eyes, I start believing<br>
Let’s bring this whisper to a shout</p>
<p>Let’s duet in ways that make us feel good<br>
Let’s duet and make that sacred sound<br>
Put two and two together, perfect harmony we’ve found<br>
We know it’s only natural, let’s duet</p>
<p>Better hear your siren, what are you implying?<br>
Look a little tired, the music got me wired<br>
Pretty good looking, boy, I’m really cooking now</p>
<p>I just want to make out what you’re saying<br>
Read my lips, it’s what you are looking for<br>
Here I am, sneaking up behind you<br>
You can always come in my back door</p>
<p>Let’s duet in ways that make us feel good<br>
Let’s duet and make that sacred sound<br>
Put two and two together, perfect harmony we’ve found<br>
We know it’s only natural, a [Incomprehensible] in natural<br>
God knows it’s only natural, let’s duet</p>

<p>Just joking</p>
<blockquote>In better days I've been known to listen
I go to waste all my time is missing
<p>I’m mapping out my ending,<br>
it’s never gonna happen now<br>
These things are condescending<br>
with everybody backing down</p>
<p>You pray to stars that can help you get by<br>
And all at once you forget to try</p>
<p>I’d go there if you let me,<br>
they’re never gonna find me now<br>
My life is always empty<br>
and in and out of doubt</p>
<p>You’re not coming back for me, these things they will never be<br>
I’m so used to being wrong, so put me where I belong</p>
<p>I’ll get back to you,<br>
God knows I try,<br>
but I still lose<br>
And I get back to you,<br>
these days run by,<br>
but I still lose</p>
<p>Angels say they can make you suffer<br>
They give and take like a vicious lover</p>
<p>When all this loses meaning,<br>
You’ll never want it back somehow<br>
Awake but still I’m dreaming<br>
And never waking up</p>
<p>Alone…Where I’m not alone</p>

<blockquote>Ashes and promises share a bond
Through the winds of change
Words are blown away
When visions that should be
Are tattooed in your mind
The power to let go
Is sometimes hard to find
<p>The answer cannot be found<br>
In the writing of others<br>
Or the words of a trained mind<br>
In a precious world of memories<br>
We find ourselves confined</p>
<p>Claws so razor sharp<br>
Ripping at the spirit</p>
<p>Promises a potential to hurt<br>
Is anything real?<br>
When forever is to be until<br>
Deep inside, in the world of empty words…<br>
No escaping from those haunting<br>
Empty words…</p>
<p>Do you ever feel it?<br>
A craving that is so strong<br>
To by thought rewind in order to find</p>
<p>Expectations that shined through the doubt<br>
That soon would turn into the price<br>
Of what a word will be worth<br>
When tomorrow comes<br>
To be and we are left<br>
Standing on our own-<br>
And seeing what is real…</p>
<p>The answer cannot be found<br>

        <p>No, any mainstream rapper will always talk about “how much bitches he gets, how much money he makes, or how much niggas he’s killed”</p>
<blockquote>back up in yo ass with the ressurection,
its the group, harder than an erection that shows no affection,
they wanna ban us on capital hill, 
cause its die mutha fuckas, die mutha fuckas, kill,
all along it was the ghetto, nuthin but the ghetto,
takin short steps, one foot, at a time and kept my head low,
ill never let go, cause if i let go,
ill be spineless, IM GOIN INSAAAAANE
[fade together]
i think my mind just,
goes out of control and judge on subjects mutha fuckas read about,
i touch on the shit they believe without,
ive seen this mutha fucka's non-spoken,
ive seen the same nigga, with a nine, die with his eyes open,
and simply what this means is, 
he didnt know every dog had his day, until he seen his,
i bet you mutha fuckas will too,
cause its die mutha fuckas, die mutha fuckas, kill foo
<p>(chorus)<br>
die mutha fuckas, die mutha fuckas, kill foo,<br>
die mutha fuckas, die mutha fuckas kill,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While in rock, a lot of the lyrics are touching and true in their lives. Most rappers are posers.</p>
<blockquote>We're gonna burn your city,
Gonna bring your system down.
I'm gonna drown my pity,
Turn this to a ghost town,
And when you know there's nothing left,
You're gonna run like all the rest.
Pack your bags and turn your back 
on all the friends you had left.
<p>And it’s time for us to live, yeah</p>
<p>It’s my time,<br>
This is just a declaration of our vows (Whoa)<br>
We won’t back down.<br>
It’s my time,<br>
This is just your resignation from our lives (Whoa)<br>
We won’t back down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>^ While this is like, not backing down from your enemy’s, and what not.</p>
<p>Both of them have some meaningless lyrics imo, but rap has more without a doubt.</p>

        <p>[quote=“asshole_rule, post:52, topic:447328”]No, any mainstream rapper will always talk about “how much bitches he gets, how much money he makes, or how much niggas he’s killed”</p>
<p>Both of them have some meaningless lyrics imo, but rap has more without a doubt.[/quote]<br>
uh, how about most mainstream musicians are poseurs… also, lyrics aren’t everything. however, in rap all there is is lyrics, everything else is a simple rhythm or synth, so… that sort of forces the quality of the music to be completely derived from the lyrics.</p>
<blockquote>Human, I can read your mind 
Stranger, from the edge of time 
<p>Watcher, water’s running deep<br>
Seer, when your eyes don’t weep<br>
Clear your thoughts<br>
Ease your mind</p>
<p>Don’t believe a word<br>
Unless it’s proven true<br>
You might just catch a spell<br>
Damnation upon you</p>
<p>Teacher, learnin’ from the card<br>
Preacher, lovin’ you is so damn hard<br>
And the tales, that you tell</p>
<p>Liar, your brain is runnin’ wild<br>
Crier, elemental child<br>
Sinner, playin’ with your thoughts<br>
Winner, are you feeling lost?</p>
<p>Solve the maze<br>
Case the haze</p>

<p>[quote=“P!ATD Build God, Then We’ll Talk”]It’s these substandard motels on the (lalalalala) corner of 4th and Fremont Street.<br>
Appealing only because they are just that un-appealing<br>
Any practiced catholic would cross themselves upon entering.<br>
The rooms have a hint of asbestos and maybe just a dash of formaldehyde,<br>
And the habit of decomposing right before your very (lalalala) eyes.</p>

Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy</p>
<p>Tonight tenants range from: a lawyer and a virgin<br>
Accessorizing with a rosary tucked inside her lingerie<br>
She’s getting a job at the firm come Monday.<br>
The Mrs. will stay with the cheating attorney<br>
moonlighting aside, she really needs his money.<br>
Oh, wonderful caricature of intimacy.</p>
<p>Yeah (Yeah)</p>
<p>And not to mention, the constable, and his proposition, for that “virgin”<br>
Yes, the one the lawyer met with on “strictly business”<br>
as he said to the Mrs. Well, only hours before,<br>
after he had left, she was fixing her face in a compact.<br>
There was a terrible crash (There was a terrible crash)<br>
Between her and the badge<br>
She spilled her purse and her bag, and held a “purse” of a different kind.</p>
<p>Along with the people inside<br>
What a wonderful caricature of intimacy<br>
Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy</p>
<p>There are no raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses.<br>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No…  that’s because you look in the wrong freaking place.</p>
<p>if you listen to some of the rappers full album, or find one of their good albums, then you’ll see they aren’t posers</p>
<p>prob not the best example… since he is dead and is not mentioned so much now a days…<br>
Tupac Shakur</p>
<blockquote>When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school; and scared to go home, I was a fool
with the big boys, breakin all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame mama
I reminice on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary?
Heeey! I see the penitentiary, one day
And runnin from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand
for a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how ya did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
<p>[Chorus: Reggie Green &amp; “Sweet Franklin” w/ 2Pac]</p>
<p>Lady…<br>
Don’t cha know we love ya? Sweet lady<br>
Dear mama<br>
Place no one above ya, sweet lady<br>
You are appreciated<br>
Don’t cha know we love ya?</p>
<p>[second and third chorus, “And dear mama” instead of “Dear mama”]</p>
<p>[Verse Two: 2Pac]</p>
<p>Now ain’t nobody tell us it was fair<br>
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn’t there<br>
He passed away and I didn’t cry, cause my anger<br>
wouldn’t let me feel for a stranger<br>
They say I’m wrong and I’m heartless, but all along<br>
I was lookin for a father he was gone<br>
I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs<br>
They showed a young brother love<br>
I moved out and started really hangin<br>
I needed money of my own so I started slangin<br>
I ain’t guilty cause, even though I sell rocks<br>
It feels good puttin money in your mailbox<br>
I love payin rent when the rent’s due<br>
I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you<br>
Cause when I was low you was there for me<br>
And never left me alone because you cared for me<br>
And I could see you comin home after work late<br>
You’re in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate<br>
Ya just workin with the scraps you was given<br>
And mama made miracles every Thanksgivin<br>
But now the road got rough, you’re alone<br>
You’re tryin to raise two bad kids on your own<br>
And there’s no way I can pay you back<br>
But my plan is to show you that I understand<br>
You are appreciated</p>
<p>[Chorus]</p>
<p>[Verse Three: 2Pac]</p>
<p>Pour out some liquor and I reminsce, cause through the drama<br>
I can always depend on my mama<br>
And when it seems that I’m hopeless<br>
You say the words that can get me back in focus<br>
When I was sick as a little kid<br>
To keep me happy there’s no limit to the things you did<br>
And all my childhood memories<br>
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me<br>
And even though I act craaazy<br>
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me<br>
There are no words that can express how I feel<br>
You never kept a secret, always stayed real<br>
And I appreciate, how you raised me<br>
And all the extra love that you gave me<br>
I wish I could take the pain away<br>
If you can make it through the night there’s a brighter day<br>
Everything will be alright if ya hold on<br>
It’s a struggle everyday, gotta roll on<br>
And there’s no way I can pay you back<br>
But my plan is to show you that I understand<br>
You are appreciated</p>
<p>[Chorus]</p>
<p>Sweet lady<br>
And dear mama</p>
<p>Dear mama<br>
Lady [3X]</p>

Yeah, you know it's me
Bitches hating on him, cause he started out here locally
Hopefully, I'll be at the top soon
For now I'm at my house, on the couch, watching cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothing when you stop and just say fuck it
Cause you walking out in public and you hear 'em talkin' rubbish
I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch, somewhere get my nuts kissed
That's the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money, ain't that some shit?
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money, ain't that some shit?

That’s why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have and they in awe<br>
We gon’ win, you can take the lose or draw<br>
What I’m in, got these hoes that used to play me in their bras<br>
We gonna take over the World while these haters gettin’ mad<br>
Take over the World, watch these haters get mad<br>
That’s why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have<br>
Hop into the car then we take 'em to the pad<br>
It’s a wrap</p>
<p>And motherfuckers think they know me but they never met the kids<br>
Style come with excellence and money make benevolence<br>
Irrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent<br>
I kill my Henny, break the bottle for the hell of it<br>
Tell a bitch, that she better bring her friend<br>
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen<br>
Yeah the party never ends, this life is what I recommend<br>
And if you got a hoe before me, then she better be a 10<br>
I ain’t picky but these girls be acting tricky<br>
When the situation’s sticky and the liquor got 'em silly<br>
But I take over the World when I’m on my Donald Trump shit<br>
Look at all this money, ain’t that some shit?</p>
<p>We gonna take over the World while these haters gettin’ mad<br>
That’s why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have and they in awe<br>
We gon win, you can take the lose or draw<br>
What I’m in, got these hoes that used to play me in their bras<br>
We gonna take over the World while these haters gettin’ mad<br>
Take over the World, watch these haters get mad<br>
That’s why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have<br>
Hop into the car then we take 'em to the pad<br>
It’s a wrap</p>
