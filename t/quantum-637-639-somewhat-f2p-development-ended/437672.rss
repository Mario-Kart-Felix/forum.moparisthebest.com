[size=36pt]This server is no longer in development. I have no computer so all of my work is gone.[/size]

The random events don&#39;t have the old NPCs due to ugly looks. They are replaced by Living rocks, Tree spirits, and Water elementals. This thread wasn&#39;t for hiring people to join in on the development, but to just show what I am &quot;now&quot; working on.

[code=Features]
Old F2P random events
F2P training areas
F2P skilling areas
Safety Stronghold with boots and rewards
Corrupt/Gravite degrading
[/code]

[code=What I&#39;m wanting/doing]
Customized war/skilling mini-games
Better combat system
F2P Quests
All F2P spells
All F2P Dungeoneering rewards with effects
[/code]

<p>I am doing this because I’ve never tried it and I think it’s unique for anything over 474 to have F2P stuff. F2P is also hard so it makes it fun.</p>
