              <p>To make a popular server it most likely will have to come out your pocket unless your coding is very unique and interesting. People like servers with a vps/dedi, and with websites that have paid domains(.com/.net/.org/.info/ect). And most big servers have 2-3 good programmers, an active forums, and good advertisers.</p>
<p>Recommend:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hire some experienced programmers (two-three decent ones).</li>
<li>Hire some advertisers (you may need alot if your server isnâ€™t too good, maybe three-five advertisers).[these work for mod-admin, cheap i guess?]</li>
<li>Make your website more appealing, and encourage them to use it often.</li>
<li>Post on lots of server status.</li>
<li>Make lots of friends on different communitys, and then ask them to join your server.</li>
</ol>
