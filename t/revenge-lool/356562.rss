    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/revenge-lool/356562</link>
    <description>This guy is getting on my server and making himself owner somehow.. cheat client maybe? but he&#39;s spawning items and handing them out and advertising his server and ip banning ppl then when he&#39;s done he crashes the server.. anyone know how he is doing this and how to stop it? his name is &quot;    1 3 3  7&quot; with the 4 spaces at beginning.. i checked his ip and it says its 0.0.0.0? His server is soulsplit source and so is mine.. anyone know a cheat client to use to do this so i can do the same to his server so maybe he will leave me alone?</description>
