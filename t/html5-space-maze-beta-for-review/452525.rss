    <description>Gethu Game&#39;s current HTML5 Game Project titled &quot;HTML5 Space Maze&quot; reached its BETA stage. Since its BETA, beware of bugs :-)

Game Description:
Guide your space craft through myriad of asteroids and reach the home planet as fast as you can before it runs out of gas. As you fly through, your half broken craft emits hazardous gases.
