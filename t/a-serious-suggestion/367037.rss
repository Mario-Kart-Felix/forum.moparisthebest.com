    <title>A Serious Suggestion</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-serious-suggestion/367037</link>
    <description>This is a suggestion that would save so many people so much time and is very simple.

On the form for creating a new thread in certain sections like RSPS downloads, snipplets, tutorials and any other sections that would/could hold server specific topics  should have an extra box in which the server base MUST be entered/selected to post the thread.

The only negative side to this is that there might be a couple mad noobs because they don&#39;t know the base of their leeched server but for every one asking or offering help it would be a huge time saver in that before help is given, there won&#39;t be 12 posts asking what base it is or of random code for the incorrect base.

Another plus side is that people that don&#39;t follow this can get warnings and banned! How fun!

</aside>
<p>I think your think of this in too big a manner. It should not be a global requirement as I said but only in the needed sections because like 7 out of 10 threads don’t mention what base they have and it causes a bunch of problems and wasted time. If we are able to, why would/should we hold back and not increase productivicty?</p>

<p>EDIT//(Holy I didn’t curse in this guys thread yet FUCK)[/quote]</p>
<p>Simple fix, if you can’t help keep it organized, you can goto jail. Like the famous quote from “The Crucible”. “You are either with the court, or an enemy of it.  There is no middle ground.”</p>
<p>for HD Models, that’s not server specific, therefor wouldn’t require this suggestion on the model section.</p>
