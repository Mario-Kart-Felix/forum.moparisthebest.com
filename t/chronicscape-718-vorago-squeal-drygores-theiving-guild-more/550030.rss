<p>emotes for diffrent items and such added, global item spawns, growing pets, fairy ring system, RS Specials and Custom Specials, fun player punishments, and alot more dont automatically turn down a server because of a advertisement, advertisements are made to grab the attention of the general masses, so i mostly incorporated things people like the most… there’s alot of other content within the server that alot of people may or may not be familiar with and that might not grab their attention as much as it would to more advanced rsps players you know?</p>

<p>Yes I did create this it really isn’t hard at all to do thats why you won’t find any matrix crap in it beside things I learned to do over the years of working on private servers even more complex than this. And I don’t care if someone doesn’t like it they are entitled to their own opinion but when it makes no sense and you only saw one or two crowns then your assumption is flawed.</p>

<p>Well that kid was mad because someone who’s now a big help on my server left that guys server and he came to mine to troll me just to talk trash. Do you even know what that’s like? It’s complete horse crap. I totally care about my players and what they think and I take it into consideration but as long as they are having fun and enjoying it’s content over some image bs that only a child would cry about then thas cool but for real it shouldn’t matter about the image stuff who cares stop your crying. So really before you judge what I say maybe learn what it takes to actually be a GOOD owner who cares about their community and tosses trolls aside. I don’t care even if they were to give me a million dollars I will kick trolls off my server no matter what they may bribe me with. And FYI I actually take the time to show each new player around the server so kill that noise.</p>

<p>I’m not quite sure you have a clue what you’re talking about. I can’t however argue that the person that made the original comment was being a bit ridiculous but the people that have made a well spoken suggestion/feedback on the matter, you have thus far become more-and-more ridiculous.</p>
<p>It’s a lot more than a child that would complain about such a thing. The crowns look awful when it comes to a professional looking server and staff team. When I look at them, it looks like I’m walking into a place where the owner has taken no pride in his work. And I can ONLY imagine what the rest is like in terms of how things were done. For example (another one), I log onto a server and see that the NPC is saying, “Welcome back to the server bitches!”.</p>
<p>You have received at least two comments from people who have ran or built PLENTY of servers over the months or years. I fail to see your point in that aspect. And I personally have been apart or owned many servers myself; I’m very well aware of what it takes to run one.</p>
<p>Your ownership will and could be the downfall of this community from what you’ve just shown on this thread, that’s ridiculous.</p>

<p>Well that kid was mad because someone who’s now a big help on my server left that guys server and he came to mine to troll me just to talk trash. Do you even know what that’s like? It’s complete horse crap. I totally care about my players and what they think and I take it into consideration but as long as they are having fun and enjoying it’s content over some image bs that only a child would cry about then thas cool but for real it shouldn’t matter about the image stuff who cares stop your crying. So really before you judge what I say maybe learn what it takes to actually be a GOOD owner who cares about their community and tosses trolls aside.
