    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-my-minigame-317/399792</link>
    <description>hi, I just want to know how can I make people cant join the minigame if this is already started? The minigame is working fine so i just want the correct syntax of:
[code]if (a player is in the game)
{
sM(&quot;a game is already started, please wait&quot;)
}
else... (i already have the rest of the code)[/code]</description>
