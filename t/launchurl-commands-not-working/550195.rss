    <title>LaunchURL Commands not working</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/launchurl-commands-not-working/550195</link>
    <description>Title is basically summing it up. commands on my 317 [PI] such as ::forums, ::vote, &amp; ::donate do not launch a url. I have searched around, and cannot find a reason. Also, I know it is not a problem in the client sided client.java, because i have a method in there for all of the above that says: 

[spoiler]if(inputString.equals(&quot;::forums&quot;)) {
						launchURL(&quot;forum website here&quot;); 
							}[/spoiler]

If anyone could help that would be marvelous. P.S. - I am thinking the issue has something to do with the URL, because i had the command ::forums working just fine, but i made a new forums and tried changing the url to it and now it wont launch anything. Please help  :eek:</description>

              <p>launchURL is a client-based command.<br>
It is, in no way, server sided.<br>
If you are trying to load it server sided, that is your issue.<br>
When you specify a url, make sure it is a full url.<br>
A.K.A if my forums were: <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a><br>
You would want to make it a full URL by adding either “http://”, “https://” or “www.” to it.<br>
I’d go with “<a href="http://YourForumURL.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://YourForumURL.com</a>”, personally.</p>
