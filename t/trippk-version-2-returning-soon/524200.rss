    <description>Welcome to TripPk.

Owners - GanGHack &amp; Absynth
Revision - 317
Base - DeathlyPvpzV4
Our Website - [url=http://www.trip-gaming.org]http://www.trip-gaming.org[/url]

I strongly believe in order to have a functional, popular server you must work with the players, not against them. In other words, we like to hear feedback from our players, regardless of how small or large the project may be we do encourage suggestions to improve.

Before anyone says &quot; DeathlyPvpz isn&#39;t a very good source, i probably wont join your server. &quot; I have spent around 3-4 months on this project, setting up the way i wanted it to be. Removing useless variables &amp; methods, Saving as much space as possible, which in-turn saves you space. I still have alot more to do, but here is a list of everything done.



We have amazing staff, a good economy.
Many money-making methods.
No dupes.
No lag.
No downtime.
We host on a secure vps &quot; virtual private server &quot;
Rewards are not sold for donations, we give you rewards for your kind donations.
We do NOT sell staff positions.
We do not tolerate hacking.
We allow using bots to an extent.

Our Rules
Have fun, Dont be a troll.
No flaming over yell.
Duping will not be tolerated.
Using bot clients to an extent is okay.
No multi-logging to receive a second starter.
No racism.
No homophobic slurs.
