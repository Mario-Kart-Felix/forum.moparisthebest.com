    <title>Australian Myths</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/australian-myths/208006</link>
    <description>Well i made a small article on Stork&#39;s site ( http://varek.net ), which i would like to share with you all. By the way, everyone should go register there. It&#39;s an excellent community.

[i]Well you may have seen the occasional Australian movie. You know, the ones in the middle of the desert with horrible actors with annoying fucking accents? Well such movies present certain stereotypes which have a lot of myths connected to it.[/i]

[b]Myth One: We ride Kangaroos.[/b]

One hundred percent correct. In fact, i have a saddled Kangaroo sitting in my backyard as we speak. After all, the male Kangaroos are around the same size as a horse. Since the Kangaroos are located everywhere, we are easily able to find a good ride.

[b]Myth Two: We all live in the middle of Australia.[/b]

Somewhat correct. Only 2.4 percent of our population live near the coast. After all, the temperatures in the desert are a lot more consistent than near the coastline. The easterly desert breeze is amazing. Plus, more Kangaroos in the middle.

[b]Myth Three: We all speak with a strong accent.[/b]

Incorrect. We all speak with an American-type accent. Though our Australian made TV shows are of better quality, we choose to use American shows because they are cheaper and appeal to us people a lot more. Plus, what is more fun than listening to a excellently educated American talking about gun laws?

[b]Myth Four: Our education is horrible.[/b]

That&#39;s also sadly true. Majority of the students in Australia rely on radio from America for education. Due to lack of roads in the desert, most people are unable to get to school. This may be the reason why we all speak with our American accents. Oh well, education is not needed as we hardly leave our tiny continent anyway.

[b]Myth Five: Beer everywhere[/b]

This is one of the correct myths. 70 percent of our exports are beer related. That&#39;s how Australia manages to keep up with the rest of the world.Half our parliament house is actually a pub and such landmarks as the Sydney Opera house are based on the look of a beer can. Sydney opera House? Don&#39;t worry, most people haven&#39;t seen it. It&#39;s around the size of... a large house located in California.

Well that&#39;s it. I&#39;m glad to have done a bit of myth busting for you guys. Us Australians are always glad to share our culture with the outside word. After all, us Australians get very lonely in the desert.
