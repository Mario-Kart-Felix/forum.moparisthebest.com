    <title>Setting up port forwarding with usage of no-ip</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/setting-up-port-forwarding-with-usage-of-no-ip/121651</link>
    <description>Dont know if I&#39;m asking the right question but heres what ive done thus far. 
1 Got my game setup
2 Created a no-ipaccount and host
3 setup router to allow portforwarding on 43594 to computer hosting game
4 Allowed windows firewall to allow connections from TCP/UDP port 43594
Now heres the problem: Users from outside cannot connect to the game.

Everyone within my subnet can connect fine and tested on many computers
Its just when I try to get someone from outside of my network to join it will not allow them.

What am I doing wrong or have forgotten?

If I have posted this in the wrong place please le me know because this is my first posting here.

*EDIT*

I figured out what I didnt do. I realized that I had to port-forward port 80 also to my server. Not sure if it was the correct method of doing it but it now works and I&#39;m happy with it.

Ports-forwarded:  2
80, 43594

***Now to create an Apache Web server to host the client and source.
***I&#39;ll update more on that later.</description>
