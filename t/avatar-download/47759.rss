    <title>Avatar download?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/avatar-download/47759</link>
    <description>Hello, 
When I was surfing the net few min ago, I came on Wikipedia =p 
I found this about private servers: &lt;blockquote&gt;For Long RuneScape has been a leading MMORPG in the world of gaming. For the past year or so people have found a way to crack the runescape client (the program that connects to the game server). These versions of the game are not exactly like runescape but are identical in many ways. They share the exact same game engine and map. They also share the same NPCs (Non-Player Characters e.g. Goblins and Demons) and Objects. The only difference the server-side things such as what happens when you click a certain button. Some examples of this is that on a base private server you will not have quests and so forth. You will also not have registering accounts through the internet. To create an account on a private server you must type in the username and passwords in the appropriate boxes in the modified client. This client can be obtained at http://www.moparisthebest.com/moparscape.html. Servers are connected to through ip addresses. The first person to discover servers and edited the client goes by the name WinterLove. The First public server ever was Blakescape. The best servers of all time are CheezScape, WhiteScape, Testscape, Hybridscape and Avatar. Those servers got the closest to being like RuneScape by making quests, full magic, full of all statistics. The owner of those servers were XerozCheez, WhiteFang, Nvi ible, Miss Silabsoft and Phate. They coded them all by themselves.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Watch this part : &lt;blockquote&gt;The best servers of all time are CheezScape, WhiteScape, Testscape, Hybridscape and [b]Avatar[/b].&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Well, now i was wonderring, where I could download &quot;Avatar&quot;.
If anybody knows where, or could send me a URL... Would be very appriciated  ! Sorry for my english =)

Greetings, and thanks for reading this.</description>

              <p>It’s not the worst, it is a very good server which is really easy to undertsand, sadly the devs stopped work on it so only a few early revisions were released which I do have copies of. It was made by StAnger (Phate). i’ll just Upload the latest version and post a link soon</p>

<p>edit: I believe early versions were MySQL but I think this one (Revision 113) is xml.</p>
