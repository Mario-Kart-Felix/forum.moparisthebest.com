    <title>Help Port forwardign and hosting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-port-forwardign-and-hosting/291495</link>
    <description>Ok so I learned how to make a server.....but I&#39;m now making a fully customized client.  So when I compress it and run it, it is running good till I get to the point where I need to enter IP adress and yeah so I&#39;m like hmmm I wanted to make an OFFLINE server not an online one.  It alrewady has the port but not the IP address so I got an Ip adress from no-ip I installed their software and and I then type in the Ip in the box it does not work I enter mine then It does not work...I then remember I had to port forward and so then I checked the port it says it is blocked or not open I go under my firewall I create new port then I retry and still the port is blocked or not reachable.  Please help me :(</description>
