    <title>GUI listener question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/gui-listener-question/243602</link>
    <description>I was just curious about making a GUI that talked to an ActionListener though a Listener i.e. port 50715
This would make it a good idea for other people who are &quot;co owners&quot; on a given server have access to edit things
And edit without using any in-game commands or VNC/TeamViewer/RemoteAssistance.

I was also curious about sending user data i.e. players logged in and player bank invos as you request the information.

This is still in the designing, so I am just curious what sounds like the best option and what are some ideas that can go into this.
So far my SWING layout I have couple tabs, here is a demo of what I have.

PICTURE: VIDEO/no sound.
Video: DivX 5 1600x1200 10.00fps
Size: 1.72 MB -- 33 seconds long
Personal Host: http://dugg.no-ip.biz/clip0012.avi
Mirror 1: http://ScarNastics.Com/clip0012.avi

Please tell me your opinions of what I have so far.
After I include everything, I will need to go back and Edit the JTables and JLists a little......

Oh, and thats just the preview mode, The actual mode looks alot better, as I have cute IcoImages for each tab ^_^
I was thinking to make the background a mandatory green color instead of defaulting off the style of the theme.

I hope i didn&#39;t miss anything or details to give to you.</description>
