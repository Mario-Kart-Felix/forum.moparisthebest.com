i did the compile.bat and when i do the run.bat it wont run. it says this crap in the black screen and closes before i can read it. i then had to re-download easyrsc… anyone know why this is happening? if so what do i need to do?</p>

<p>No, It wasn’t my goof, I told you the server.java file is in your Server/src/org/rscdaemon/server folder then scroll or look down at the bottom of that folder and ther will be a file called server open that and do what I said above and yes compile after you edit the server.java file.</p>

<p>If you are using hamachi. First go into your client and open the settings and change it to your hamachi ip and do the same for the settings file in your server folder, then go to Server&gt;src&gt;org&gt;rscdaemon&gt;server and open the file called server.java and search for “acceptor.bind(new InetSocketAddress”(without the “”) and put your hamachi ip between the “”.</p>
<p>for example: acceptor.bind(new InetSocketAddress(“127.0.0.1”   &lt;—That is localhost which will allow only you to connect, so don’t put that its only a example.</p>

<p>K so open up server.java and search</p>
<p><code>acceptor.bind(new InetSocketAddress("127.0.0.1", GameVars.portNumber), new RSCConnectionHandler(engine), config)

Or then search for 127.0.0.1 or localhost</p>

              <p>You’ll need to portforward. If you have a router, go to <a href="http://www.portforward.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.portforward.com</a> it has a guide for almost every router out there. Follow the guide and then you should be good. If not, go to google, and type in “hamachi download for free” download hamachi, usually from logmein. Once download make a network for your server, tell your friends to download hamachi and type in the network name to join. Once they are joined, put your IP into your server.java on the server side, and into your Settings.ini in the client side, give them the client via email or any upload site, and voila! you can play with your friends! hope this helped.</p>
