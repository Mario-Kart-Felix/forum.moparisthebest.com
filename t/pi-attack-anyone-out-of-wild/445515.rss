    <title>[PI] Attack anyone out of wild</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-attack-anyone-out-of-wild/445515</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve seen this happen on a server, but the owner does it purposely. I want to find out what I need to do so I can set wildy for only me, anywhere I want. If that&#39;s possible, does anyone know?</description>
