        <p>The war ended in a stalemate, and everything was set back to it’s original state. The US didn’t win.</p>
<p>Ontopic: The Dutch police is allowed to pull-over and fine anyone not wearing a seatbelt while driving. When a passenger isn’t wearing a seatbelt, both the passenger and the driver have to pay a fine.</p>
<p>We also have alcohol checks, where they pull-over almost everyone passing by and check them for alcohol.</p>
<p>You might think that all this is just too much government interference, but the US has 3 times the amount of Road fatalities per 100,000 inhabitants, compared to the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Yeah. Though, although they can pull you over for nothing, they can’t search your car without valid reason - they’ll try their hardest to find a reason, though. Which is why, if you are going to engage in activities that would cause you to not want to search your car, like the OP, you have to be extra careful about things like not using worn tyres, making sure you don’t drive with a brakelight out etc. Being anal about things like that can really pay off. They can also ask you exactly where you are going and why, which is something you don’t have to divulge if you are not in a car (though if it’s not somewhere you shouldn’t be going, it is kinda wise to just answer this question and keep them happy…)</p>
<p>Here ends mopmans short dealing with police lesson… not that I often have reason to not let police search me or anything. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>EDIT: a good place to keep on top of this stuff (for all jurisdictions, not just uk) is bluelight - for example the uk thread at <a href="http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=261644">http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=261644</a> … site is about drug harm reduction and therefore nsfwork/parents</p>

        <p>I found a dusty old book the other day, it contains a very interesting quote that I think is relevant to this discussion about Britain and America.</p>
<p>The year is 1803.</p>
<blockquote>In Paris, the US minster to France, Robert Livingston, was also frantically trying to acquire land in Louisiana, specifically near the vital gulf coast port of New Orleans. Louisiana, retroceded to France by the Spanish court in 1800, was a truly vast territory, which posed a serious thread to US aspirations. Worse, its great seaport amid the swamps of the Mississippi delta controlled the passage of some 40 percent of America's exports. The United States desperatly needed land or, better still, the entire city of New Orleans. But Paris was showing relcutance to do business. Just when the situation seemed hopeless, Livingston, through an admirable sleight of hand, won - simply by putting it about that the United States was considering a rapprochement with Great Britain. Such an idea was exactly what France feared - a reunited Anglo-Saxon empire. This gross misrepresentation by the Americans induced Napoleon Bonaparte to react favourably towards the US request; instead of granting its wishes, the emperor sold the United States his entire Louisiana territory, all 828000 square miles of it, for a mere 60 million francs, or $27,267,622. Overnight, the land area of the United States more then doubled. But Napoleon was no fool; apart from the useful cash, "the sale assures forever the power of the United States, and I have given England a rival who, sooner of later, will humble her pride."</blockquote>

<p>Neat, and it certainly seems like a feasible enough story.  I don’t know if it in fact happened that way or not, but I don’t see how it would affect this discussion one way or the other.</p>
