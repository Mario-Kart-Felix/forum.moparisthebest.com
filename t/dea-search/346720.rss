    <title>DEA Search?</title>

    <description>So today I was driving my friend to gamestop, and out of no where a DEA agent flashes his lights and pulls me over.. I know this was  a DEA agent because there was 2 undercover vav/suv cop cars, and they were wearing vests that had DEA on em. So the cop walks up to the vehicle and i ask why are you pulling me over sir? he looked around my vehicle and then said after like 20 or 30 seconds &quot;the kids do not have saftey belts on&quot; (please note that my back window is basically mirror tint, and its a chevy s-10 so the seat belts are down on the bottom) so the cops took our license without asking for my registration, and then they call the k9 unit, and tell us to get out of the car, and the officer asked &quot;may i pat you down and search you&quot; I told him to go ahead because i didn&#39;t have anything to hide, so he pats me down, and then he says the k9 is going to smell your car for illegal substances, so the dog smells and then it, scratches my door alerting the officer illegal substances are in the vehicle.. So the cops rummage through my car, only finding an empty bag. (please note that the cops broke my gf&#39;s glasses, glovebox, and the dog scratched my paint) They let me go on a warning saying people weren&#39;t in seatbelts. My question is do you think this was a legal search?</description>

<p>Neat, and it certainly seems like a feasible enough story.  I don’t know if it in fact happened that way or not, but I don’t see how it would affect this discussion one way or the other.</p>

They can pull you over for nothing in the UK - just to check you out, if they feel like it. Vehicle stops are different to a normal stop &amp; search.<br>

<p>Ouch.  I guess the UK has always done stuff like that though, the War of 1812 was even started because the British navy insisted on ‘pulling over’ American commerce ships and forcing the crew into the British navy (they called it ‘impressment’).  So the Americans were forced to teach the British a second lesson.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah. Though, although they can pull you over for nothing, they can’t search your car without valid reason - they’ll try their hardest to find a reason, though. Which is why, if you are going to engage in activities that would cause you to not want to search your car, like the OP, you have to be extra careful about things like not using worn tyres, making sure you don’t drive with a brakelight out etc. Being anal about things like that can really pay off. They can also ask you exactly where you are going and why, which is something you don’t have to divulge if you are not in a car (though if it’s not somewhere you shouldn’t be going, it is kinda wise to just answer this question and keep them happy…)</p>
<p>Here ends mopmans short dealing with police lesson… not that I often have reason to not let police search me or anything. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>EDIT: a good place to keep on top of this stuff (for all jurisdictions, not just uk) is bluelight - for example the uk thread at <a href="http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=261644">http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=261644</a> … site is about drug harm reduction and therefore nsfwork/parents</p>

<p>That’s right if you are talking about an extended cab S10, but you said there was 1 other person in the car with you, so why would they sit in the tiny back seat when they could sit in the passenger side, which have shoulder belts?</p>

They don’t have to ask you to let a dog sniff your car, and if the dog ‘alerts’, then they can search it.  But they should have to replace anything they break if they don’t find anything.</p>

<p>I know that is the way it used to be, but it is state-dependent and I’m pretty sure most states have made it legal to pull you over for not wearing a seatbelt.  Look at the huge click-it or ticket campaign on TV recently.</p>

<blockquote>The United States Supreme Court has explicitly determined that a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in an automobile belonging to another. Though the passenger does not have a standing to challenge the search of car that he does not own, [b]he can still challenge the lawfulness of his own detention when the car is stopped at a drug interdiction checkpoint, and therefore, he can seek to suppress any evidence seized as fruit of his allegedly illegal detention.[/b] Even assuming that drug interdiction checkpoint was legal, such that the officers did not violate the passenger’s Fourth Amendment rights by stopping the vehicle in which he was riding, a passenger’s detention was held to be independent and separate from officers’ discovery of drugs during the search of the vehicle’s driver/owner consensual search of the vehicle.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Consent to search 
If the actions of the suspects or the contents of their car raise further suspicions, the officer can ask the driver for consent to search the car. [b]No one is ever required to say yes[/b], but if they do, the officer needs no additional cause. The suspect has waived his Fourth Amendment rights, and the officer can conduct a full search. The officer is not required to tell the suspect that he can refuse consent (at least, not under federal law -- some states may have laws requiring this notification). This aspect is controversial because not everyone is aware of their right to refuse consent, and many people say yes out of fear or the feeling that the officer will do the search anyway.</blockquote>
<p>tl;dr you are a retard for letting them search it</p>
<p>edit: wait, did the dog sniff the inside of your car, or just the outside?</p>
<blockquote>In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that using a drug-sniffing dog around the outside of a vehicle does not require a warrant nor any specific suspicion or probable cause, and does not violate the Fourth Amendment. If the dog "alerts" to the presence of drugs, that creates enough probable cause for a full search, without consent or a warrant. The "reasonable" amount of time provision is vaguely defined, although wait times up to 90 minutes have been allowed by federal courts</blockquote>

              <p>So today I was driving my friend to gamestop, and out of no where a DEA agent flashes his lights and pulls me over… I know this was  a DEA agent because there was 2 undercover vav/suv cop cars, and they were wearing vests that had DEA on em. So the cop walks up to the vehicle and i ask why are you pulling me over sir? he looked around my vehicle and then said after like 20 or 30 seconds “the kids do not have saftey belts on” (please note that my back window is basically mirror tint, and its a chevy s-10 so the seat belts are down on the bottom) so the cops took our license without asking for my registration, and then they call the k9 unit, and tell us to get out of the car, and the officer asked “may i pat you down and search you” I told him to go ahead because i didn’t have anything to hide, so he pats me down, and then he says the k9 is going to smell your car for illegal substances, so the dog smells and then it, scratches my door alerting the officer illegal substances are in the vehicle… So the cops rummage through my car, only finding an empty bag. (please note that the cops broke my gf’s glasses, glovebox, and the dog scratched my paint) They let me go on a warning saying people weren’t in seatbelts. My question is do you think this was a legal search?</p>
