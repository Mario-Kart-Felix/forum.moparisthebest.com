    <description>Does anyone play this game? I&#39;m a huge dragonball fan and I bought it probably 2 weeks after it came out, but didn&#39;t start playing until now, lol.

What&#39;re your thoughts on the game? I&#39;m on the fence about it right now. It&#39;s probably the best dragonball game to be released to date, but it&#39;s certainly lacking. Like every other dbz game, it&#39;s pretty much just a button smasher. My girlfriend managed to beat me her first time ever playing, and she didn&#39;t even know the controls (although it could be because I&#39;m horrible). I also would&#39;ve liked to see more characters. I think adding characters can only make the game better. It&#39;s missing some of my favorites, such as Janemba, Dabura, Baby, etc. Haven&#39;t tried online yet, so if someone could tell me how it is for them, that&#39;d be cool.

What&#39;re your thoughts and experiences with the game?</description>

<p>20 seconds in.[/quote]I think it’s worth £15 max I would not buy the game otherwise, ever. Especially after playing it for like a day or two.</p>

              <p>The gameplay is fun, however the storyline is nothing special. As Pure_ said, fighting mechanics could be improved - however, for a fighting game, it’s rather good.</p>

              <p>Me and Albi fudgeed around with this a while in MP. I like the fighting angles, but the fighting mechanics could be improved. I can’t remember my full feelings of the time since it was a while ago now. Fun game nevertheless and I liked the start on MP they did.</p>
