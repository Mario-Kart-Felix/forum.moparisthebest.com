    <title>Need A Development Team</title>

    <description>[center]Hello, and thank you for reading as I sincerely appreciate it!
Right now I have been playing and &quot;Trying&quot; to learn how Runescape Private Server&#39;s work. But recently I have found a server that my friend plays and noticed it needed some help, since I have a 1 year experience in Java Programming and have never actually applied my java skills to working with a Rsps...I decided to learn.

So that&#39;s where this development comes in!
I will need a decent development team of atleast 2 more people (if not more) on being patient and helping me out on learning and developing this project.
I will be posting my progress and keeping you guys updated on my work as it becomes developed.
Since I am new to this type of thing, I would also like suggestions on keeping you guys happy as well as me learning.

Below is the Application field:


Java Skills:
What will you be helping with?(Source/Client):
Do you have Skype?(If yes Skype Name):
Your age: (Just because)
Recent Projects/Work: (If any)


That is all for now, I will be posting pictures and what we are doing when we have a team.[/center]</description>
