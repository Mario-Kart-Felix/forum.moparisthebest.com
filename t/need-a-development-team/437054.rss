We Can talk more about this at skype , Mic is not needed we can chat it out and discuss.

This Server is a 317 based and Has a lot of features , and My aim is to make this server the best and for that I need a good development team and ofcourse you have to be trust-worthy. I will make sure you are trusted and have some pretty good knowledge about coding.

My Dream is to have a fully functioning server with not more than 80 players , ofcourse satisfied players and our development team has to work hard. Im sure we can work this out.

Anything that you want to discuss about positions , etc ADD ME ON SKYPE.

I Will show all the features of the server, if you interested in joining my team.

What Role You Want:
Java Experience in d/m/y ( Days, Months or Years ):
Why You Want This:

How Active You Are:
