    <description>Hey its Onelife, I have little experience in the coding RSPS feild, i have good experience in coding websites though. I need a good coder who is online alot and willing to get on when i need them to. I need a good bug finder who is experienced when it comes to searching for those hard to find bugs that our online community will eventually find. I need a bug finder who can prevent that. The requirements are MSN Messenger. TeamVeiwer is optional, it is prefered but optional. Reply if you are interested or not. Thank you.</description>
