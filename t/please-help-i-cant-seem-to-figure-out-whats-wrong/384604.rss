    <title>Please Help I Can&#39;t Seem to Figure Out What&#39;s Wrong :(</title>

    <description>Okay so I&#39;ve been hosting a server for quite some time now and all of the sudden one day... It just wouldn&#39;t connect. it kicked every player off and went &quot;offline&quot; on the server status page. 

I Changed nothing, Did nothing, and can figure out no reason why this happened.

I tried every possible thing I could think of to try to get my ip working again.

Here is a list of things I have tried:

Restoring Router Defults and Re-Portforwarding
Deleting ip&#39;s from No-Ip reloading and re-creating
Resetting environmental variables and changing back
Downloaded jdk 6_24
Downloaded jre 6_24
Tried To Connect VIA Ip
Tried portforwarding through BitTorrent...


Nothing Has Worked And There&#39;s No Reason For It And I&#39;m Very Confused :(</description>
