    <title>[RESOLVED - DENIED] Remove Closed Servers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/resolved-denied-remove-closed-servers/519993</link>
    <description>I think it would be a good idea to remove servers that are no longer online from both rs2 and rsclassic advertisement page to make it easier to find a server. It will save a lot of time for a lot of people.</description>

<p>if they do lock the server, then the owner should again contact a moderator if the server comes back. It’s quite annoying when a person have 10 advertisement threads.[/quote]I agree, but good luck enforcing that rule.</p>

Unfortunately we don’t have the man-power to be digging through the advertisement sections to find dead servers. The only solution I see to this is server owners reporting to us that their server is no longer running.

<p>You could just report all the dead servers… although I’m not sure if any action will be taken or not</p>

What brilliant attitude to see from a global moderator! It’s nice to see staff constantly trying to stick by the rules (rule 12, for example) and to improve the community feeling around MoparScape. Great job, Jc22493, you are a shining member of the staff team.[/quote]</p>
<p>Wait, did you address my point or brush it off completely because I was correct?</p>
<p>I do my job as a staff member and moderate the forum. I am, however, a regular human being and will express my thoughts and feelings. If you are enraged by someone proving you wrong, you really need to simmer down. You’re not the center of the world.</p>
<p>Also, this discussion between you and I are over. I will not post anything regarding our ‘argument’ on this thread again, and you will be infracted if you do. If you still have a problem with me, feel free to PM me. This thread is for the discussion of the suggestion.</p>

For the rs2 servers you can delete threads after x amount of days. Just let owners know to keep a backup of their advertisement thread? Just a thought.<br>

Not enough manpower from moderators to do such a thing. Unless you mean having this be automated, which I don’t support.[/quote]</p>

<p>We are here to discuss the suggestion. You said that there shouldn’t be a sticky for a server list because stickies are removed for sectional rules. I showed you that you were infact wrong, and that stickies are used in a variety of situations. Why are you attempting to make me defend myself on someone else’s thread? If you have an issue with the link I posted you can talk to a staff member.</p>

<p>That’s just an individual’s opinion who apparently implies that organizing server advertisements is not important enough to be stickied. I respect his opinion, and also confident that the person with the actual power to make this happen will weigh the pros and cons to make a wise decision.</p>

I see no reason for you to be so aggressive. If I misinterpreted something point it out for me.<br>
To your idea, this isn’t half bad. An issue would be if a server representative would forget to send his renewal.<br>
[/quote]<br>
My intention is not to spark an argument but simply addressing a problem that is easily solvable to make the forum much more efficient. There are over 115 pages for RS2 and 25+ pages for RSClassic advertisements, thus it is extremely difficult to pinpoint the active servers. Your concern with server representative forgetting to send in his renewal can be alleviated by having them sending an email to the staff(s) coordinating the activity page. Keep in mind that they have 30 DAYS to post a renewal of activity request, and if 30 DAYS is not enough then it shows how appreciative (or lack of) they are of using moparscape forum as an opportunity to promote their server. Overall, this will make the forum more active and people will have an easier time navigating through the advertisement forums.[/quote]<br>
I never said I have anything against the thought. Overall I wasn’t against it, and I think that it would be a useful tool in organizing the advertisement sections.</p>

Just create something that removes them when they are at like 30% uptime.</p>
<p>They can make a new thread if they reopen.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Once a server reaches under ~40% uptime it is automatically removed from the SSP, last I checked.<br>
Also, a server can easily abuse this by going offline for a week, then posting another thread, then repeat. It is an easy excuse to post multiple threads.[/quote]</p>

To your idea, this isn’t half bad. An issue would be if a server representative would forget to send his renewal.[/quote]<br>
My intention is not to spark an argument but simply addressing a problem that is easily solvable to make the forum much more efficient. There are over 115 pages for RS2 and 25+ pages for RSClassic advertisements, thus it is extremely difficult to pinpoint the active servers. Your concern with server representative forgetting to send in his renewal can be alleviated by having them sending an email to the staff(s) coordinating the activity page. Keep in mind that they have 30 DAYS to post a renewal of activity request, and if 30 DAYS is not enough then it shows how appreciative (or lack of) they are of using moparscape forum as an opportunity to promote their server. Overall, this will make the forum more active and people will have an easier time navigating through the advertisement forums.</p>
<p>P.S. I didn’t see the “Community Suggestions” subforum. Could someone kindly move this post there? Thanks in advance.</p>
