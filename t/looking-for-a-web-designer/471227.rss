    <title>Looking for a web designer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-web-designer/471227</link>
    <description>I am looking for someone to create a design for my website, I was hoping for free but I will give rslegacy.org domain for doing it or I offer to do graphics for you in return. I could possibly pay a few bucks but would prefer not have to go though the trouble of getting paypal money. I am not looking for a professional web designer but the more experianced the better. Please reply here or add my skype below,

Skype: thefatman101

If interested please post or add me with the following filled out.

[CODE]How much experiance:
Payment? (domain, graphics, free, paypal):
your skype:
preview of some work(not needed):[/CODE]

Thanks very  much in advance</description>

<p>You can do what you’d like, but I personally wouldn’t just give him a template, no matter how good or bad it may be. Let him figure out how to make them on his own, considering the fact he’s being so abrupt coming here and asking for help, with an attitude.</p>

If you read my thread properly you would see I am willing to pay, just mentioned that free would be very well appreciated. Maybe next time read everything before posting. thanks.<br>

<p>Yes I understand that but Ruby is saying about going to a free template place, that isn’t what I want. I want a customly made one, and I said I am willing to pay yet Ruby took as I was ONLY asking for a free one, I am not acting hostile towards Ruby. I was just stating that I am willing to pay some.</p>

              <p>If you’re asking for something for free I don’t think you’re terribly at liberty to ask how much experience a person has in that area. Go look at a free website templates site if that’s what you’re looking for. Or look at some <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">CSS documentation</a> and basic HTML then you’ll be able to do it yourself.</p>
