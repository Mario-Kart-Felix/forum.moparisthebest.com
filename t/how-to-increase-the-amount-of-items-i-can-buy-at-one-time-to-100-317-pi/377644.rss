    <title>How to increase the amount of items I can buy at one time to 100 [317, PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-increase-the-amount-of-items-i-can-buy-at-one-time-to-100-317-pi/377644</link>
    <description>My shops currently have a buy 1, buy 5, and buy 10 feature, but I would also like a buy 100 feature. How would I add this? I have no class9.java file

I don&#39;t mind getting rid of one option to replace it with buy 100.</description>
