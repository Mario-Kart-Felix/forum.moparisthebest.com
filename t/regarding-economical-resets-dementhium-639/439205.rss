    <title>Regarding Economical Resets [Dementhium 639]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/regarding-economical-resets-dementhium-639/439205</link>
    <description>Hello, i would like to do an Economical Reset on my RuneScape private server... I have a command which I&#39;ve modified so it resets economy basically, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily do everything what i want or exactly what an economical reset is, can somebody help me with it?

Here is the command i have modified for this purpose:
[code]		if (command[0].equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;economicalreset&quot;)) {
			for (Player p : World.getWorld().getPlayers()) {
					p.getInventory().reset();
					p.getBank().getContainer().reset();
					player.getInventory().refresh();
					player.getBank().refresh();
			}
		}[/code]

Now, what this does is for all the [u]online players[/u] it clears out their bank and inventory followed by a refresh to re-assure me that everything is &quot;swell&quot;, for those of you who didn&#39;t know. Now as i mentioned this only applies to [u]online players[/u] how can i go about making this for all accounts in general?

My second issue with this is that it simply doesn&#39;t remove equips, simply inventory as well as bank... Can somebody please provide me with a snippet for the Equipment reset?

If somebody can help me with any of this... I will be more then greatful and be forever in your debt, if i can help you... Thank you for reading. Have a wonderful life?</description>
