    <title>Acess any site, program</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/acess-any-site-program/208132</link>
    <description>I am sick of people using proxys. Everyone that uses them can admit there damn annoying and slow things down alot. So here is a tut i wrote on a program that you can install, named ultrasurf, that will alow you to go on anysite, No problem. Unless Your school has very strict malware/software installing policy, which i have heared happens, then this will not work as it is a application. But if you bring it in on a CD i see no reason why this would not work.

PS-My school does not alloy .exe files from being opened unless they are installed on the C drive (wich i only have access to the H drive/network so thats why this comes in handy becuz it is a direct .zip file :)

TUT:

Okay I thought i would post this lil thing to help out some peps as we all have had trouble getting around numerous proxys and firewalls at your works/schools computers.

So here is a way to get past ANY work/school firewall

Steps:
-Get a CD, doesnt have to be too big, you can even add songs to it like i did.

-Download A Sick program called Ultra Surf, its sweeeeet, from here http://www.ultrareach.com/company/download.htm (you dont need the manual just the top download)

-And then save it to your cd just as you download!

-Go on your computer that it is blocked on and transfrer it from your CD to the computer

-DONE 

It downloads as a .zip and you dont need admin. privlages to download or use because it already comes as a nice little program no installation required. Its .zip not exe, cuz schools like mine block .exe files from opening.

So thats it; if you want to download other programs and need help, let me know! I downloaded cheat engine for my friend, he wanted to doo amazing at some game but when you download it as .exe you cant open it. I can help you with any prrogram besides programs that need Admin Privlages!

If you want to download at school/work doo this

Go to this link http://www.rajeshrana.net/2007/08/08...ng-technology/

Then scrolldown and it will say Download the exe file, click that link

If it doesnt work then do this. On the filter it should give you the link of the site wich is the DDL. So copy tht and go to https://www.beatfiltering.com

Then just paste it and download it.

Edit
At my school now when you download it by the way above. Then it downloads as some weired unreadable file. if this happens then you gotta do this


Open it, Select; Choose From A list of prorgrams

Then Choose to open it with IE. IE will then open and it will tell you to redownload it.

Once you download it this time it will download rite and it will download in a file like f48047873394(or something). Open it and then ultra surf will be rite there &gt;!


Also I have heared people from my school are getting in trouble for using this program but i have had no trouble. Hopefully no body rats me out becuz i have installed it on over 100 of my friends comps :/ uhhohhh hah.. Have fun</description>

              <p>My Schools PCs CD Drives and USBs are disabled by BIOS therefore you cant even load a OS at startup. The Internet Filter blocks everything that hasnt been verified therefore you cant go on homemade proxies and you cannot copy anything to the C:/ Drive.</p>
<p>Any ideas of going on any site on those PCs without taking the battery out?</p>
