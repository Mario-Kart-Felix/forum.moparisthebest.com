    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-there-any-way-to-connect-my-server-to-the-client-without-running-runseve-bat/418733</link>
    <description>The title says it all. I have a PI server named brokenx v2 and i really want to have it up but who plays has to have my source file but that means they can edit there character and i thought about making a webclient but the tutorials dont make any sense to me. I have portforwarded port 43594 and it said the port was open but i have a cable connection to my modem but when i go to runelocus server status checker it says my server is offline. So Is There Any Way To Connect Your Server To The Client Without Runserver.Bat? Please help Fast!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</description>

              <p>You change the client ip so they can connect to you,<br>
you only keep the source where u run your runserver.bat<br>
others will be able to connect on your server with only the client</p>

              <p>The runserver.bat is just an executable command so you don’t have to open a Command Prompt session and type the command yourself. What you want to do is unachievable. If you wanted to remove the need for running it through a terminal you’d need a GUI for your server and then build it into a Jar. But you seem to be having IT problems your end, which has nothing to do with your Runescape private server. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
