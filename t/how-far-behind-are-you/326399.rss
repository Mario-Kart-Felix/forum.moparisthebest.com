    <title>How far behind are you?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-far-behind-are-you/326399</link>
    <description>to make me feel better (or worse) about my current school work situation, post what you have to have done and by when. For those lucky enough to be out of school, post what deadlines you may have and are worried about. Me:
History
- 3,000 Personal Inquiry on American History between 1756 - 1877. More specifically &quot;To what extent were the grand intentions of the Founding Fathers still prevalent up to the start of the Civil war in 1861&quot;. Must use 5-6 sources including, books, DVDs and primary sources written at the time - In for April but following strict deadlines - time limit no problem but its gunna be fucking hard to do well.

English
- Read the entire play of Hamlet by Shakespeare by Monday w/ notes - major ordeal
- Two pieces of transformation coursework totalling 3,500 words - In for 2 weeks

IT
- A whole project focussing on project management and multimedia design and use. Had ages to do this, but I am so fucking lazy at this important time, I am ridiculously far behind. In for Feb 4th. Could perhaps get a small extension.

So whats everyone elses homework/schoolwork worries</description>

<p>Study for a Hypergeometric and Binomial Distribution Test for Maths (Confident), Tourism Test for Geography (Which is quite simple) and a Science Test on Genetics (Which as of present, I don’t have much of an idea of due to me paying little attention in class).</p>

              <p>my webdesign course, the entire class didnt do anything, all the assignments everyone skipped, didnt come to class. the teacher knew we could make far better sites than the curriculum expected since we sold a few in the past, it was 9 of us in the entire senior grade class… so 3 weeks before end of the year/semester he told us to submit 1 webpage and do all our design on that, that 1 page dictated the entire mark (midterm + final + 4 assignments we had to do that no one did/showed up for) and we all had such good marks because as long as you had a nested table with some sort of attempt to make the screen look good with layout and colour, you had an easy 75. lol</p>
<p>but that teacher was known to be a chilling type, never knew he was THAT chilling. (for any one curious, teachers are NOT allowed to do that, so how he pulled it off, without getting fired is out of my grasp.)</p>

What do you study? If I was to guess I’d say something like Pharmaceuticals, but I’m not completely sure. Either way, sounds like a full on subject.<br>
Sorry if you’ve mentioned it before; I can’t remember.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m studying Pharmacy Tech. and Radiology. Radiology is what I really want to do, but there is a long waiting list so in August I should be able to take my final classes. Pharmacy Tech. is just something I’m doing while I wait.</p>

              <p>Well yeah I was actually told not to worry about work, but I knew that if I didn’t then I wouldn’t pass any of my subjects and my chances of going to a good uni would be screwed. Maybe I shouldn’t have ignored them, but it worked out fine for me so I assumed it would be the same for others.</p>
<p>My original statement was a little drastic, but I’ve known a lot of people who blame their bad achievement on illness when they were capable of working but felt they didn’t have to because they were ill. I understand what you’re saying and I suppose that if someones motivation to work is altered negatively by becoming ill it’s a mental state beyond their control and is probably for the best (health wise).</p>

              <p>Well anything which causes headaches, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, extreme pain, depression, etc is obviously going to stop you from reading/learning a thing. That’s not collectively by the way.</p>
<p>You’re suggesting because you missed a few a months and experienced it first hand you know better? Find me a doctor that tells you to work while your ill and I’ll happily agree with you. You wont though because everyone with any sense knows that the road to recovery requires rest and a lot of it. I know this from being out for 6 months and spending days pumped up with morphine, oxygen and an epidural. Working while ill is only going to slow that process down. I wasn’t even allowed to walk for more than 5 or 10 minutes a few weeks after my surgery.</p>
<p>I just don’t see how you can proclaim everyone’s lazy, if illness motivated you to work - good for you. It gives you no right to come and shoot down a bunch of people with false assumptions. Maybe I’m overreacting but I don’t want people reading your posts and feeling like shit because that’s not going to help anyone.</p>

<p>I have actually, that’s why I said it. I was in hospital for a week, and missed a few months of school. If I hadn’t been ill I would be sitting here and agreeing with you.</p>
<p>Unless you’re in a coma or you have injuries so bad it’s not physically possible for you to read a book then there’s no problem. I managed to do fine. In fact, if I hadn’t been ill in the first place it would never have motivated me to get off my backside and learn the stuff because I wasn’t going to learn it any other way if I couldn’t go to school.</p>
