    <title>Creating my own logo (symbol)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-my-own-logo-symbol/183406</link>
    <description>In my Language Arts class we are currenty doing a fun&#39;ish&#39; activity in which we make a logo that goes along with our personality. I&#39;m not sure though what I should draw. I am a basic artsistic person I usually sketch drawing like dragons or people with swords...

My personality in school:

Quiet
Active
Between D and B averages
I day dream alot (or when im sleepy I&#39;m just dreaming)
I treat my teachers how they treat me
I never do my homework unless its near report cards time or something like that.
Always in class before the bell


Outside Personality/with friends:
Loud
Active
Usually playing basketball|Foot ball

Home:
Lazy
Quiet&#39;ish&#39;
Responsible with most easy chores
Can get attitudes

Computer:
I express alot more
I talk alot more
I am alot better at learning on the comuter than listening to boreing lectures
I am less artistic with pc programs.

Other:
I am 14, about 5&#39;10 or 5&#39;11 
I always excercise in summer
I love games
I enjoy socializing with my buds
I love to draw mythical creatures
I always see friends on certain days
I live in a lonely neightborhood with older ppls.
I snowboard
Work with dad


Thats mostly it. I expect more understanding people to support me in this because I really don&#39;t need help I just wanna see what I&#39;d be best at drawing for because I&#39;m not that great with ideas.


Directions: Draw a logo that represents you and or what you do, your personality. Afterwards describe it on the back.

This is really easy basic stuff but anyway suggest:

Color
Symbol

Thanks guys,
