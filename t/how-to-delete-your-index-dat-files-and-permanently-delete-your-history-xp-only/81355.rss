    <description>This COMPLETELY erases ALL of your history, not some of it or just the cookies.


Press ctrl+alt+del and go to the processes tab.
Find explorer.exe and click end process.
then go to run under file
type in cmd and click ok
then type
[code]cd\
cd documents and settings\your username here\cookies[/code]
then type in 
[code]del index.dat[/code]
now go back to run and type in explorer.exe

There is more then 1 Index.dat file, but i can&#39;t seem to find it on my computer...so until then...That is the only one that i can find using google.com</description>

would this work to delete the history of Youtube search? Because I find porn on either Google or Youtube and I need to clear its history before my parents come on lol.<br>

Can’t you just go to cookies in your Documents and Settings User file and delete everything there to get rid of the porn links on Google or Youtube?[/quote]it doesn’t delete the index.dat files…explorer gives an annoying message that won’t let you delete it…</p>
<p>besides if your parents think you are looking at porn…then they can download a history reader…and it will find the index files, and read them and give your parents the links…and they will find out you ish a porno man im gonna update when i get home to include all the index files… and then ill upload a bat file to clear it…</p>
