    <title>Road Race - August 26th</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/road-race-august-26th/134391</link>
    <description>Well, I thought I&#39;d share this, because on the August 26th, I am doing my first ever road race.

I&#39;ve had a turn around, I guess. Where I kind of want to go towards road racing. Good thing now, as you have to be 13 or older to do road racing...
It&#39;s soo cool, I got my first road bike and all my leathers and armor etc. 2 months ago. I just hope my road racing license comes before August 26th haha.
Well, going to be soooo fun.</description>
