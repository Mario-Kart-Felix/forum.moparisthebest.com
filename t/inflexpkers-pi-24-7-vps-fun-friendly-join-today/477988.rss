You can download the client [URL=https://dl.dropbox.com/u/90137669/iPk/iPk%20Client.rar]here[/URL]!
Better off visit our forums [URL=http://inflexpkers.com]here[/URL]!


InflexPkers is PI based server with many modifications/ improvements done to maximize the enjoyment of our players. The server can handle a good amount of players without any lag if any lag is found we always make sure we find the issue and try to fix it ASAP.
We&#39;re also a server which tries its best to get the server working without any bugs, The staff team is always there to help players, We also have players who are titled &#39;Helpers&#39; which always backup the staff and help them with helping other players, these players are experienced players who know most of the game so they&#39;re there to help you at any time. We have recently started and we are looking to stay around for quite a while. I am not going to tell you we are perfect in anyway basically because in my point of view nothing is perfect but we can make them almost perfect which I like to call near-perfection. when it comes to the combat system.. all the way from switching to eating is amazing we have spent many hours and days working on it and making it very enjoyable. Now I am not going to stop there the skilling system Ive got one word to say.. SPECTACULAR!
We accept all kind of players pkers, skillers &amp; merchers! We are also looking for hybrids to test our bridding out and give us the feed-back and what can be done to make it better. We try our best to keep the server stable &amp; all the players happy as well as we have a vps running the server with a 99.9% uptime.
As I stated before we are a very new private server but really.. what would make you choose us instead of the other many private servers??
