<p>What they should be doing is coming up with games (or content for existing games) that’s actually fun and exciting to play.

<p>The other thing their employees are critical of is that developers of non-runescape projects are coerced to be ‘more like Runescape’.

<p>EDIT: To clarify my position: There are no accessibility issues with the current game that could be considered a dam holding would-be players back from the game.

The Evolution of Combat was shit, plain and simple. They’ve taken the notion of keybindings and so on from WoW (and most other MMORPGs that followed) and produced what is essentially a really slow-paced equivalent.<br>
Additionally, it takes too much time to reach the end-game. And even when you do, you’re looking at hundreds of hours of shit work to obtain the top armour… If you don’t have the top armour, you basically can’t function at a high level anymore.<br>
At the end of the day, this means that it’s a kids game as far as competitive play goes… Oh, and adults like myself who started playing a decade ago. Even for kids though, there probably aren’t enough hours in the day to get the best equipment and maxed skills.</p>
<p>tl;dr: Waste of time to move to HTML 5. Technological accessibility is not an issue, but playability is. The ‘buy-in’ is too high (hundreds of hours) in terms of leveling, and the same can be said of obtaining items.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah, I’ve started playing in 2002, and I’m still such a noob on there lol. Every update just ruins the game just that much worse. I quit playing when they released rs2. I don’t think rs3 would actually be that bad if it didn’t include EOC(which is only fun for a little bit, and then you get sick of it)</p>
