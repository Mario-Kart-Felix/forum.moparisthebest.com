              <p>[quote=“Lothy, post:69, topic:509363”]I think the fact that they were going to call their second big game ‘Mechscape’ speaks volumes as to just how little creative talent they have. They couldn’t even come up with an interesting name for it.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, even other game development teams at Jagex are encouraged to ‘be more like Runescape’. Mechscape was probably dumped for being same shit, different name (essentially).<br>
You guys are free to disagree. Time will tell (but I think their waning player base is telling enough).[/quote]It was renamed Stellar Dawn at the start of development.</p>

              <p>I don’t think we’re arguing that RS isn’t dying (at least I’m not), I’m talking solely about the future of RuneScape as it is. Whether or not Jagex needs to make a new game I think is arbitrary to how good this update is, which is probably where the argument started. I agree that they should branch out, and I agree that RS is dying due to past updates, but if you were saying this is a bad update for RuneScape itself, that’s where I disagree. I think it looks pretty good. It’s not EoC-esque in that the community thinks it’s horrible and will ruin the game. Those changes were already made, which is why it’s dying anyways.</p>

              <p>I think the fact that they were going to call their second big game ‘Mechscape’ speaks volumes as to just how little creative talent they have. They couldn’t even come up with an interesting name for it.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, even other game development teams at Jagex are encouraged to ‘be more like Runescape’. Mechscape was probably dumped for being same shit, different name (essentially).<br>
You guys are free to disagree. Time will tell (but I think their waning player base is telling enough).</p>

<p>because mechscape, funorb, and the others had all been successful :). to be fair arcanists was a great game and they fucked themselves over by not marketing funorb better.</p>
<p>The move to HTML5 does open them up to be a mmorpg on tablet, depending if it actually plays well or not on them. if it does work it could be a huge draw.</p>

              <p>I don’t think dying is a reason to call it quits, if you’re still making money. I don’t really see anything wrong with this RuneScape 3 update, it’s not like the EoC where you are drastically changing gameplay forcibly onto people, it’s purely a graphics update (which lets face it, has already been changed and wont be going back) and customizable update. I don’t see what part of the current playerbase would think that’s a bad thing, unlike EoC. Not a current player though, I did quit once the EoC hit. I don’t think it really surprises anyone that the game is dying since the EoC hit, the number of people that said that was a bad call was tremendous (and MMG said he regretted the change if I remember correctly). But I don’t think this will make it worse.</p>

You’ve overlooked the nature of gameplay (which I’ve called slow-paced) and dismissed that in favour of some extra animations. Slow clap for you.</p>
<p>I guess we’ll know if I’m right sooner or later. After all, with a maximum of 50k players online at a time (far fewer than Jagex’s glory days) how long do you really think they can continue to operate?</p>

              <p>^ That is not 100% true… A lot of people look forward to improved and amazing graphics. Moving RuneScape to HTML5 will do so because using Java as a game engine, limits the definition of the graphics that can be added. As for the EoC, it made combat more realistic rather than just attacking with the same animation every time. How about this, you go and get a sword and try attacking something or someone with the same move every time, it will get boring very shortly. You need a variety of attacks and moves to counter and confuse your opponent. Yea, switching combat styles or weapons will do something, but for how long? Anyway, it’s not your company and if you don’t like the new combat, you can still go play the '07 server or not play at all, no one is forcing you to play. So quit bitching about the EoC already, it will not change anything.</p>
<p>Edit: As for Jagex supposedly taking ideas from WoW, you go try and make an original idea game that someone hasn’t thought of already. I guarantee you that it will be very hard, if even possible. Blizzard did not think of all of their ideas and people are giving too much credit to them.</p>
<p>Also, the BTS 46 video:<br>
<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="Hg94lsLRmXc" data-youtube-title="RuneScape BTS 46: Beta News and Dungeoneering!" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div></p>
<p>The last bit of the video that contained pictures of new Castle Wars look pretty good. I look forward to the Castle Wars update.</p>
