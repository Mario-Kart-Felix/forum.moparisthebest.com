    <title>Need a Client that will handle this</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-client-that-will-handle-this/464997</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

I was wondering if anybody knew of a good client to use to get the source I am using to make a &quot;Practice Server&quot; I am using Vyrescape&#39;s source and I have tried their client and it got stuck at 1% loading, Tried using another client (Zenith) But same thing, Got stuck at 1%. Do you think it might be my source? or do I need a client that would handle a 726?

P.S. I am not using these servers to make money or even portforward them, I am using them as practice to help me make my own server.

Thanks,
Mike</description>
