    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-tutorial-though-nobody-helps-in-this-section/97399</link>
    <description>Ok, im trying to add 2 new npcs that sit there and say something. Heres all I know... 
Ive added them to the autospawn thing, and also the npchandler.java for the talking..but i get this funny error when I attempt to runserver. Is there anywhere else I&#39;m supposed to add npc stuff to to get it to work? A tut on this would really be appreciated..
EDIT: Ok in client.java I found all their names but i have no idea what they mean.
[code] else if (NPCID == 944) { // Combat Instructor - Pure Shop
PutNPCCoords = true;
WanneShop = 42;[/code]
Thats one of them, I don&#39;t understand what the wanneshop thing is, or what wanneshop number to put for my new npc. Any help on that? If there is any more spots I need to put npc info in for it, help would be appreciated.
EDIT2: OK IM PRETTY SURE I DONT NEED HELP WITH ANYTHING BUT THE WANNESHOP THING, ^^ SO JUST ANSWER IT PLEASE! WTF IS THE WANNESHOP AND WHAT NUMBER WOULD I PUT AFTER IT FOR MY NEW NPC (mysterious old man annoncing owner on or off)[br][size=1]Posted on: May 19, 2007, 09:49:41 PM[/size][hr]SORry for double post but please someone help...Mod taharok? Lol.</description>
