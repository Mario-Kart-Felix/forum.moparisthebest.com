 Problem number 1.I added some customs and only 4 of the weps act weird....the 4 weps are custom godswords...i got the models and ints here on mopar and fixed the ints (they were wrong) and completely added them.Problem is when you stand, walk, run, attack, or anything with the godswords they stay in 1 place and do not move (added the anims for them, made em just like real godswords) here is a pic....

Problem 2. I am using richscape V4 and cannot find the codes to change wich tele in spellbook takes you where....it is like it was moved to a diff file but I cannot find it any idea where it could be?
