    <title>317 source that is organized?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-source-that-is-organized/478440</link>
    <description>So if I compare 317 and 718 (or 600+) coding theres one thing I would really like to have in 317. 

In 317 everything is handled in couple files. Now it makes it hard to read and its annoying to code. For example if I want to make dungeoneering I have to code objects to object list, buttons to action handler and almost everything else to client.java and its just hard and slow.

Are there any 317 sources where everything would be organized like in 718 or some 600+ servers? For example one minigame would be coded in one or couple classes, and they would have objects, interfaces and everything else in them? I am not skilled enough to do this by myself ;(</description>

<p>Shard Revolution practices this. If you’re interested in Plugins like Miss Silabsoft proposed, may I recommend Apollo? You can dig and see for yourself fairly easily which Bases are well-structured and designed.</p>

No what I mean I would like to add feature in one class. For example money pouch would be handled in one or couple classes instead of 5 or more. Same goes for minigames and so on.<br>
If its so hard let me make myself clear:</p>
<p>MOST 317 sources:<br>
You have classes actionhandler, objecthandler(different name but handles objects),npc handler and client class. In example I use these. If I wanted to make dungeoneering minigame this is what I have to do:<br>
Add npcs to npchandler, add objects to object handler, most of code to client.java and maybe some in dungeoneering.java<br>
If I want to improve dungeoneering after a while I have to go to each of these classes, search for dungeoneering items and modify them. Its slow and its annoying<br>
You only pretty much edit like 5 files in server when you add new stuff and they get VERY VERY huge.</p>
<p>In 718+ (and propably some 600+):<br>
You have minigame like dungeoneering, its handled mostly ONLY in dungeoneering classes. You don’t have to modify object list or npc list becouse you can do all this in one file. So for example I could have just 5 dungeoneering classes speficically ONLY for dungeoneering.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah if you could use any of these lists in one class it would be so much help. And I am not really famliar with right coding dictionary, sorry for that.<br>
But what I mean is that I would like to use all classes within one class. So making minigame could be done all in one places, defining objects, interfaces and everything. It makes it very hard to for example find all dungeoneering code when there are 5 different classes everything containing spesific stuff.</p>

              <p>So if I compare 317 and 718 (or 600+) coding theres one thing I would really like to have in 317.</p>
<p>In 317 everything is handled in couple files. Now it makes it hard to read and its annoying to code. For example if I want to make dungeoneering I have to code objects to object list, buttons to action handler and almost everything else to client.java and its just hard and slow.</p>
<p>Are there any 317 sources where everything would be organized like in 718 or some 600+ servers? For example one minigame would be coded in one or couple classes, and they would have objects, interfaces and everything else in them? I am not skilled enough to do this by myself ;(</p>
