<p>I agree with you, the days when people used to train hard to achieve skills to pk in places such as mage bank, people used to actually play the game with spirit, now there isn’t really anything to it, i liked it when there wasn’t weapons what can hit as much as they do now, i liked it when whip was ruling the weaponry.</p>

              <p>I remember the early days of RuneScape where I would Duel for money, Pk with friends in the deep wildy, and merchant items for hours.  It was when they started breaking down on RWT that the game instantly went to shit, taking out pking and dueling took out the 2 best things to do in the game I thick, and giving items a set price ruined merchanting.  The game has been on a downward slope, and from the looks of it they aren’t planning on changes because they care so much about preventing RWT that they are ruining the game to stop it.</p>

I hate the way you can't trade properly. The game has gotten gay, or maybe I'm just too old.</blockquote>
<p>I agree, the times when pking was allot easier without all the rules they’ve placed down now it would be allot better, also i liked having to be able to try and get into world 2 and walk around trying to buy items i think that was the whole point of the game to get your own way through it, when they brought out you just have to put your money into a machine and get the item you want straight away that just defeats the object of it all.</p>
