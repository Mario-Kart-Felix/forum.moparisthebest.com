        <blockquote>Back to wildy without a stupid barrier I say. I liked pking back then. Now the pk worlds suck.
I hate the way you can't trade properly. The game has gotten gay, or maybe I'm just too old.</blockquote>
<p>I agree, the times when pking was allot easier without all the rules they’ve placed down now it would be allot better, also i liked having to be able to try and get into world 2 and walk around trying to buy items i think that was the whole point of the game to get your own way through it, when they brought out you just have to put your money into a machine and get the item you want straight away that just defeats the object of it all.</p>

        <p>I remember the early days of RuneScape where I would Duel for money, Pk with friends in the deep wildy, and merchant items for hours.  It was when they started breaking down on RWT that the game instantly went to shit, taking out pking and dueling took out the 2 best things to do in the game I thick, and giving items a set price ruined merchanting.  The game has been on a downward slope, and from the looks of it they aren’t planning on changes because they care so much about preventing RWT that they are ruining the game to stop it.</p>

<p>I still don’t understand to this day how/why Jagex did what they did with RWT, and especially how many ate it up and became sheep. I miss the olden days as in RSC where the staff actually played and interacted with players. People were more mature, trustworthy, and the game was a challenge.</p>

<p>What a joke. You know the game has barely improved player wise. Though the players may <span class="bbcode-i">seem</span> more mature, that’s only because a lot of the pking crowd was made up of older people. But really, most of the same players that played then still play today.</p>
<p>And why did they do it? Because they realized that, on the economic standpoint, something needed to happen. I personally believe they are also a bit understaffed, so they weren’t able to keep chasing RWT around. Why are the understaffed? That’s quite obvious, as they are releasing a new MMO soon, and that requires a ton of staff, right? So anyway, I think they did what they did to save the game from anymore hell on a very complicated, factor-filled basis.</p>

<p>I agree with you, the days when people used to train hard to achieve skills to pk in places such as mage bank, people used to actually play the game with spirit, now there isn’t really anything to it, i liked it when there wasn’t weapons what can hit as much as they do now, i liked it when whip was ruling the weaponry.</p>

<p>I still don’t understand to this day how/why Jagex did what they did with RWT, and especially how many ate it up and became sheep. I miss the olden days as in RSC where the staff actually played and interacted with players. People were more mature, trustworthy, and the game was a challenge.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>What a joke. You know the game has barely improved player wise. Though the players may <span class="bbcode-i">seem</span> more mature, that’s only because a lot of the pking crowd was made up of older people. But really, most of the same players that played then still play today.</p>
<p>And why did they do it? Because they realized that, on the economic standpoint, something needed to happen. I personally believe they are also a bit understaffed, so they weren’t able to keep chasing RWT around. Why are the understaffed? That’s quite obvious, as they are releasing a new MMO soon, and that requires a ton of staff, right? So anyway, I think they did what they did to save the game from anymore hell on a very complicated, factor-filled basis.<br>
[/quote]<br>
the CEO said in a question thread on rs that they hired a whole new team for the new MMO – didn’t affect RS development etc at all.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m assuming it did change some things, as a lot of management shifts have been happening for the last year.</p>
<p>I didn’t make that post to argue about Jagex staffing. I made it to prove a point. People make the past sound better than it was just so that they have something to complain about. Face it people, RS is barely worse than it was a few years ago. In fact, there were more rulebreakers back then and more reasons to break the rules.</p>
