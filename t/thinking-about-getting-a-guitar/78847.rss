    <title>Thinking About Getting A Guitar</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/thinking-about-getting-a-guitar/78847</link>
    <description>Well I get 500$ to spend soon (And then my birthday is right near) and I have been thinking about buying a guitar. I have some questions. I want to spend around 250 - 350$ and I want to get an electric and an amplifier. Maybe an electronic tuner too. And I was wondering;

What is the best to start with? eg brand, accesories or starting pack etc?

I am planning to teach myself any tips?

And anything else you can think of that might help me.

It would be best if you actually know what you are talking about, You learn guitar or own one.</description>

I think I should just buy a good condition second hand ibanez from the pawn shop along with a good amp. Marshall or something.[br][size=1]Posted on: April 13, 2007, 05:32:26 PM[/size][hr]<a href="http://www.musiciansfriend.com/product/Ibanez-IJX121Metal-Guitar-Jumpstart-Package?sku=518877" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.musiciansfriend.com/product/Ibanez-IJX121Metal-Guitar-Jumpstart-Package?sku=518877</a></p>
<p>Thats what someone recommended me. Which looks good. And I hope they ship to Australia.</p>

              <p>Well, for a first guitar I’d say either get a crappy one like The Un Named said or get an ibanez <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Guitar Center has Ibanez RGs with EMG pickups for 200 dollars, if Im not mistaken. Ibanez’s are easy to play and lots of cool famous people play them. As for an amp…get a line 6 or something, it doesnt really matter just as long as it sounds good. for a tuner, get a Korg CA30 chromatic tuner for about 20 dollars.</p>
<p>As for teaching yourself, there are tons and tons of things you will need to learn. You should really look into getting a guitar teacher, because theres almost always something he or she will know that you dont. But if thats out of the question then I can give you a few tips. For starters, electrics are usually a lot easier to play and way more fun. They open you up to so much more than acoustics. Acoustics are mainly used for playing chords and just about nothing else. But no matter which one you play, you need to first learn ur chords, scales, and notes of the neck. Memorize the notes of a standard tuned guitar and know which notes come after what, like sharps and that E and B have no sharp notes. Learning to alternate pick is very important. Also, always remember to keep your fingers parallel with the frets and keep your thumb low on the neck unless you are playing chords or something. That will help you play faster and easier. Know about harmonics and sweep picking, because they are really cool and used a lot in metal. Try really hard to keep your right hand on the top of the bridge of your guitar so it just pivots to get from one string to another. Learn how to change guitar strings and tighten the truss rod in your guitar. And lastly, know that most of the sound of your guitar comes from your pickups and amp. EMG, DiMarzio, and Seymour Duncan make really good pickups, and Marshall makes good amps. The majority of this I learned within the first few months of my playing guitar and it helped a lot.</p>
<p>Start out your guitar playing with simple things, like some Metallica stuff. Learn like the whole intro to Master of Puppets and the break down towards the middle. Crazy Train by Ozzy is good to start out on too, just learn most of it but the solo. Other crap I started out on were the intro to Raining Blood by Slayer, the intro to Sweet Home Alabama, the intro to Hells Bells by ACDC, various Iron Maiden stuff, and the scales. Scales are awesome for making you faster. You can get gud guitar tabs at <a href="http://ultimate-guitar.com" rel="nofollow noopener">ultimate-guitar.com</a>, they have like everything.</p>
<p>Good luck out there <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

The best thing to have whilst teaching yourself is Patience… When i was teaching myself it took me about 3 seconds to move to a different chord when i first started… But, after just practicing and going a bit further every now and then i can now move to another chord instantly.</p>
<p>Also, it helps if you get a chord chart or know someone who can play so they can show you some new things.<br>
Good luck.<br>

<p>Chord books are a first buy, Then get your self a nice busking book of music like the beatles, its easy and good music. But if you want to understand music so that one day you can write you own decent stuff, you are gonna have to buy some music theory books or DL them.[/quote]<br>
Yeah I was planning on doing that.</p>
<p>[quote=“Elite2142 (Skating On Java), post:4, topic:78847”]If you get a guitar this is what I would choose:</p>
<ol>
<li>Epiphone Les paul standard. - A bit heavy but sounds nice.</li>
<li>or Squire fender statocaster. - Sound bad but light and good to start with.</li>
<li>Epiphone SG - Looks very nice, Sounds good, although not ideal for starting and the neck is heavy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your choice.[/quote]<br>
Prices? I need an amp to remember</p>

<p>An ibanez aye?. Maybe I should start playing classical. (Was planning on thrash, heavy metal, speed and SOAD.)</p>

As hex key said, go to a big guitar store and really just hold the guitar… even if you have no idea how to play… and dont you dare go for the one that looks the best (i did that on my first guitar buy, it looks great but its really not all that easy/good to play).</p>
<p>Anyways good luck</p>

<p>Also, it helps if you get a chord chart or know someone who can play so they can show you some new things.<br>
Good luck.[/quote]</p>
<p>Chord books are a first buy, Then get your self a nice busking book of music like the beatles, its easy and good music. But if you want to understand music so that one day you can write you own decent stuff, you are gonna have to buy some music theory books or DL them.</p>

              <p>If you get a guitar this is what I would choose:</p>
<ol>
<li>Epiphone Les paul standard. - A bit heavy but sounds nice.</li>
<li>or Squire fender statocaster. - Sound bad but light and good to start with.</li>
<li>Epiphone SG - Looks very nice, Sounds good, although not ideal for starting and the neck is heavy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your choice.</p>

              <p>The best thing to have whilst teaching yourself is Patience… When i was teaching myself it took me about 3 seconds to move to a different chord when i first started… But, after just practicing and going a bit further every now and then i can now move to another chord instantly.</p>
