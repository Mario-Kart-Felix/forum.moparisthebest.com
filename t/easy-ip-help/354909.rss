    <title>Easy IP help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/easy-ip-help/354909</link>
    <description>I am on this server atm and I cannot use the webclient for some reason, have Vista 32 bit. But when i download their client the cache is screwed up and i cannot use d claws(they show up as &quot;Sealed Pot&quot;) also i cannot use lunar, just get a client crash. So i downloaded exion client and all i ahve left to do is change the IP of the exion client to my servers IP, where can i find this magical number? They use strictly webclient but it has to be in some file in the client folder. Thanks!</description>
