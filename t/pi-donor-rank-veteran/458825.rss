    <title>[PI] Donor rank/Veteran</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-donor-rank-veteran/458825</link>
    <description>Okay my server has a donor rank, but for it to show the Symbol or have any donor rights they need to have a PlayerRight of 4.
But in the Character file there is a Donor = 0-3. Place.
How would I make it where to be a donor you need 1 donor rank, super donor = 2 donor rank, extreme donor = 3.
Also, I would like to add a Veteran rank completely. How would I go about this? I search google for guides but they are all Delta guides.
If someone could help or point me out to a proper helpful easy to use guide i&#39;d greatly appreciate it. :D Thanks.</description>
