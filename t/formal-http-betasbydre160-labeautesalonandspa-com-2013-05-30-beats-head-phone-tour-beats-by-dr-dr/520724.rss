The campaign&#39;s current ad obtain has been estimated with more than $5 million on the next week.Audio: Henry W. Bush: &quot;We will certainly strengthen Social Protection and Medicare for the best generation, and for generations to come. I believe great choices are made with care, made out of conviction. We will create prescription drugs available and affordable for every elderly who needs all of them. You earned the benefits. You made your own plans. And President George W.
