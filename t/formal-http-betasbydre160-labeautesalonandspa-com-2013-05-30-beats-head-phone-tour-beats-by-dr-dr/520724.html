The CBS News Governmental Unit is checking the latest  campaign commercials. Jane Ruvelson analyzes ‘No Changes, No Reductions,’ a new George W. Plant ad that aspires to convince senior citizens he’ll shore upwards Social Security and also Medicare. The Advert: George W. Plant this week launched a good ad about Social Security called Zero Changes, No Reductions. Though the Bush campaign declined to identify exactly where the advert would run, they’ll rotate it to their current ad lineup in as many as 21 states. The campaign’s current ad obtain has been estimated with more than $5 million on the next week.Audio: Henry W. Bush: "We will certainly strengthen Social Protection and Medicare for the best generation, and for generations to come. I believe great choices are made with care, made out of conviction. We will create prescription drugs available and affordable for every elderly who needs all of them. You earned the benefits. You made your own plans. And President George W. Tree will keep the promise of Social Security. No changes. No discounts. No way."Visual: The ad opens with pictures of jubilant seniors, then cuts to Bush giving his meeting address to an keen audience. More scenes of seniors follow - a woman receiving her blood pressure checked, a man batting in a ballgame, a couple moving luggage into a Winnebago. Wrapping it up is more of Bush at the convention podium.Fact Check: Simply no outright inaccuracies. Nevertheless, Bush’s Social Security program - and whether or not it will strengthen the actual retirement system : is the source of a lot debate. The Strategy: From a week of loose poll numbers and doubts about his or her tax plan, Simply no Changes, No Reductions provides Bush a way to present a positive, issue-oriented communication. Additionally, the commercial goes a step more past Bush advertising which promised older persons he’d leave Interpersonal Security benefits intact; in No Alterations, No Reductions, Plant pledges to make medications available and affordable.  <a href="http://monsterbeats255.labeautesalonandspa.com/2013/05/29/beats-pro-red/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">beats pro red</a></p>
