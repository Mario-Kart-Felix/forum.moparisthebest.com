    <description>Ok, i got a few questions, if you can anwser it will help me out alot!


I deleted 2 shops, cant remember how... so i need to know how to do that. I tried going to autospawn going to there id thing deleting everything, saved, then compiled. That didnt work.

How do i only delet one item in a shop. I went to autospawn.cfg, deleted the item code, compiled. That didnt work

If u click on food on my server it eats it right away. So u can eat five monkfish in one second pretty much. (i have wepion that i would like to be able to delete from a shop and change the stats)

Some monsters dont die. 

How do i make an item really good that only i can use? That can hit HIGH like one hit any monster.

How do i add drops to monsters.

How do i change what shops sya.

If u help me out thanks! I got to go to bed so ill look at this in the moring. Thanks again everyone!</description>

              <p>to make a Item hit very high, look for the item in item.cfg and next to it there will be numbers the first 3 are shop price, the last couple are the bonuses, change the bonuses to a high bonus like 10000 to make it hit high.</p>
