    <title>A couple questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-couple-questions/226566</link>
    <description>I am making a gaming engine for cheezscape, and i am trying to add a button that changes the energy of the account to unlimited.Where in the script do i find the energy, and when i find it, what value do i set it to? Or how? Also, i want to make it so that there is a button that makes it so that the player faster. How would i set the player speed? One more question: Say i made a model for use of the game, how do i go about importing it and what file type must it be (will .obj work?) Thanks
