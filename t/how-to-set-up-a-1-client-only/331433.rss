    <title>How to set up a 1 client only</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-set-up-a-1-client-only/331433</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

I was woundering, how can I make it so if people try to connect to my server using a different client, they log in but they get a message saying that they don&#39;t have my client and they need to download it and for the people who have it don&#39;t get the message. I tried making it with the interface maker but there is no background.</description>

              <p>I want it to be like this.</p>
<p>Client 1 = Not My Client<br>
Client 2 = My Client</p>
<p>Client 1 logs into server = message pops up to tell them to get Client 2.<br>
Client 2 logs into server = no message pop up.</p>
<p>I think that’s a bit better.</p>

              <p>do you mean on your client or your server, like you want a message to popup in your server when they login or do you want it to popup when they load your client, i think your trying to say you want something to popup if their on a different client, and trying to connect to your server or what?</p>
