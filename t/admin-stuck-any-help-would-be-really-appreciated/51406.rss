i just recently became an admin (maybe a week ago) and now when i try to log in it goes to the screen and everything but the map will never load...

it just says &quot;loading-please wait&quot;

              <p>The reason is because the owner added you to a list in his client.java, sometimes when that happens, the code reads the name, but not the other way.<br>
So ask the owner to make you admin manually, using the character files instead.</p>
