    <title>Server Download Help. ( Which One )</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-download-help-which-one/386012</link>
    <description>I am having a amazing problem trying to pick the right client (+) source to download. The last three I downloaded where absolulty what i wanted when i was reading about them from the forums, but when i actually tried to put my ip in them, the source&#39;s messed up or they had locked shit to where i couldn&#39;t customize the files. This is what i 100% want:
A 100% customizable client (+) source.
A 100% recomended client (+) source. &quot; even by staff. &quot;
And a client (+) source that is NOT laggy and Fin freezes my people out.</description>

<p>Yeh, that’s very true. Personally if I was you Ninja I would just go to <a href="http://www.java.sun.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.java.sun.com</a> learn Java and pick the most stable base out there.[/quote]</p>
<p>I have followed vid. after vid. and i have done all that java stuff. But i don’t want to make my “own” server yet. I want to “customize” a server. Thats why i want it to be 100% customizable. You know what nvm. As long as it is customizable to all the last ownership im fine. I just want people to enjoy it knowing that im hosting it. I want a server that is 100% virus free and that when i put my ip in it will actually work!@@!</p>
<p>If you know a Client (+) Source download PLEASE give me the link!@@!!@!!@</p>
