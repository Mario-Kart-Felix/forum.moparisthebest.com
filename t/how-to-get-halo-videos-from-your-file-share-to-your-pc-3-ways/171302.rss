    <description>[b] easiest method - 3 [/b]

OMG FINALLY DONE - note this is not stealing videos or warez at all, you are just downloading .flv files off the internet

In the process of trying... first i need a video
[b]THE PROGRAM ATM IS CLOSED FOR UPDATING BUT GO AHEAD AND DOWNLOAD FREE VIDEOS FROM THE SITE AS A .FLV...READ MORE AND GO TO PART 3[/b]  :P.

[b] Method one [/b]
One way (closed for now) sign up at Geevee.com. (don&#39;t enter a fake email, you won&#39;t be able to register then).
Now confirm the email..etc,. On the main screen, you should see this:
[img]http://img242.imageshack.us/img242/277/geeveegrabfrontpagedm9.jpg[/img]

click GeeveeGrab. 
Atm you can&#39;t use it, but it gives you info [u]When[/u] you can, but theres proof it works.






[size=20pt]Part two: [/size]

Thank you to damntheyrealltaken
on youtube for this part, this is how you can download the file from GeeVeeGrab:
Here&#39;s how to upload a sweet Halo 3 vid to Youtube without a capture card.

THE VID NEEDS TO BE IN YOUR FILE SHARE!

Go to http://www.geevee.com and create an account ( Fellix edit: DONE ). Then click on the upload beta grab tool ( the one with the &#39;&#39;beta&#39;&#39; written on it, its at the top of the screen you cant miss it. ( Fellix edit: i showed you were it is )

Now find the link of your movie - it&#39;ll look somthing like http://www.geevee.com/index.php?p=viewvideo&amp;v=12345. The important part is the 12345.

Go to http://www.geevee.com/video/45/12345.flv replacing the 45 with the last two digits, and the other part with the full number. It should ask you if you want to download the file. Say yes and download it to your computer.

For example, my video&#39;s link on Geevee was http://www.geevee.com/index.php?p=viewvideo&amp;v=20522. You see that last number at the end, 20522? You would take that number and do this with it.

http://www.geevee.com/video/22/20522.flv

Then it will ask if you want to download it. Proceed with the process below.

Step two- http://media-convert.com/convert/ Go there (thanks CarnageXB) and use the browse to find your video. Once you&#39;ve got it, scroll down on the page. Select an output format ( some that ive heard that have been good are wmv and mpeg ) and check the box on the terms of use or w/e.
Hit OK and wait for it to download and there you have it, your video , in better quality.

[b] Method 2 [/b]
Second option:
Requires a camera
and books.
stack the books up and film your t.v :P




[b] Method 3[/b]
 [b] THE EAISEST WAY OF ALL[/b]
1. Sign up a geevee.com (Look at method one before part two)
2. Make sure the video you want is in your file share
3. Use the geevee.com halo grabber (will be back online very soon)
QUESTION: once your video is uploaded; and you want to add stuff, how do i do this?
continue on in the tut.
4. Now you need to download the embed file to your computer; if you have any experince at all, you know its a .flv file.
lucky for you google saves our life, i found some programs, and you need the companys converter too:

http://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/Download-Managers/FLV-Downloader.shtml ( downloader )
