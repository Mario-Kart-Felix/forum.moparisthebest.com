        <p>You surely are mad. Funny thing is that here, unlike R-S, no one is going to probably back up your point of view unless you do it sensibly. Or people probably don’t care. A lot of the community here honestly just doesn’t care about emulation, or is doing their own thing. You however, take it to an extreme where you feel some sort of radical pride. This article was partly satire, I knew it’d draw you here and I’m glad it did. You too cube_. This did exactly what I hoped it would.</p>
<p>I stated this as opinion backed by some facts and sure you’re welcome to your own opinion but once you start trying to be louder than other people who have justified opinions I think that’s not really justified. I don’t think people should flame you and this is just a poke at the culture you promote. Like, in the end what does it matter. Objectively I know people who are amazing programmers, and it isn’t their mission to try and save people from their own stupidity. People do what they do because thats either what they know what to do, or its just better for them. Inherently in this argument I wrote, people use PI/Delta/Runesoruce because they fit their needs better than Apollo. And they <span class="bbcode-b">DO</span>. Therefore I made the conclusion that they are better for people to use, I never stated design wise, I stated for the perspective of their use.</p>
<p>And I will STAND by this. You just won’t accept it. Anyway. Thanks for your perspective filled with personal attacks, which sure you can say I personally attacked Graham, but I think there’s a difference between calling someone an idiot and saying that I don’t see him as a proper game developer. I don’t. I mean he never got past networking in any public release. Maybe because he had some sense that there was a perfect solution, like I use to have until I realized that substance usually triumphs theory, and that it wasn’t worthy putting in unless it was absolutely perfect. Nirvana fallacy, yada yada.</p>
<p>And hey, I guess maybe a few more articles wouldn’t hurt to try and analyze Apollo and why it’s not a good piece of software. You’ve convinced me to look deeper into it.</p>

<p>I’d say this is true for newer users, and given the premise of my topic I’d argue that it was a bad move to use Ruby for plugins but there are a very limited amount of scripting languages that are suitable for things such as this. However though, I think people would adjust to the skill floor if they saw that it was worth it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think there’s a large segment of the community that don’t really know much Java either and essentially rely on copying and pasting code from tutorials. In fact, I intended the plugin system to cater to this group: the idea was that you’d download the base, edit a few config files with things like server name and experience rate, and then use some sort of CLI or GUI tool to select which plugins you wanted to enable/disable. Probably also with some sort of package manager-like system such that you could download plugins that weren’t included in the base distribution.</p>
<p>I think anybody who has picked up Java properly should be able to pick up Ruby fairly easy. I also think that Ruby is probably easier to learn than Java if you’re completely new to programming.</p>

<p>1). Given the nature of the Runescape protocol with the delay between frames of time also known as ticks all data from messages received from clients have to be handled in an asynchronous manner to assure that no race conditions occur in the provided application because of how messages mutate models on a consistent basis. Asynchronously decoding and encoding messages isn’t even responsible in the same context because even in this applied design a netty worker loop thread will asynchronously decode and encode messages when they are flushed to the socket channel. This is a pretty moot point, it’s expected behavior and it’s worded in a deceiving manner to make it seem like this is the responsibility of the emulation itself when rather the actual behavior is not in the manner it was described.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Obviously Netty does call the encoders/decoders in the pipeline in order and on the same thread for an individual channel. However, across <em>all</em> channels it does this in parallel (if you’ve given it enough threads). This is what the point about parallel encoding/decoding refers to.</p>
<p>If encoding/decoding, the representation of messages and the handling of messages was all mixed together (like it is in a typical wL derived server, for example) you’d have to do all of that on the single game logic thread (which isn’t necessarily a bad thing, just pointing that out).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, the famed ‘multirevision’ holy grail. As a personal note I have always up until the past year considered this to be a strong selling point with a piece of emulation software. My opinion on this changed when my philosophies of design changed. Designing features that detract, or even add too much complexity, to a problem that could be simply solved in a manner where the easiest efficient solution is implemented wastes time efficiency and leads to over designing. With the implemented design, I do not deny that it would be possibly for multiple revisions to be supported because the message layer is often revision to revision agnostic.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Multi-revision was mostly a side effect of separating the representation of messages, encoding/decoding them and handling them. Once you’ve done that, it’s quite easy to add support to swap in a different set of encoders/decoders.</p>
<p>Note that this doesn’t go as far as some servers which allow multiple revisions to be used at once - which is far more complex as you start needing to worry about things like what if player 1 wields an item that is too new for player 2 to support? Apollo doesn’t need to worry about any of that complexity.</p>
<p>[quote=“sini, post:1, topic:552864”]The way that the Apollo multi-revision support is set up is by registering message decoders and encoders which are responsible for decoding a message in a specific manner. The reason for this is because in order to inhibit packet bots, such as Aryan, Jagex randomized packet opcodes and streams so that the data between the client and server would be difficult to decipher. This is fine, except for the fact that behind the madness of this implementation you have to consider that you will have to create a single abstraction to decode and encode a message. If each abstraction is confined to a single class then you are writing up to two-hundred and fifty-six classes just for this purpose and these classes will have to be modified for every revision.</p>
<p>This causes a lot of boilerplate, boilerplate is seemingly repetitive code that shows up in various occurrences that seems like it could be confined into a smaller simpler manner. I would consider this to be one of Apollos major flaws, and frankly it’s hard to engineer around this efficiently and I do owe this to the fault of Graham or the Apollo developers at all.[/quote]</p>
<p>I think Major has some plans for using a bunch of files for describing the protocol - my old <a href="https://github.com/grahamedgecombe/opencraft/blob/master/data/packets.xml#L1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Minecraft classic server</a> did this. You could probably come up with a fairly simple format that’d be able to represent the structure of almost every packet - player updating is probably too complex to represent like this, and would remain as it is now. The rest would either be dealt with common code that uses reflection (the approach I took with the Minecraft server) or for better performance you could generate bytecode for each encoder/decoder at startup.</p>

<p>Graham and his team could possibly not have known this at the time, but for future considerations especially in more serious development projects I’d consider the issue of packet decoding somewhat a priority to implement in an efficient manner as to help stifle cheating programs that may have the intention of harming your server.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Apollo does verify most packets and most certainly does not trust the client. The major omission here is probably not verifying walking - that’s just cos it isn’t implemented yet, I’m sure Major &amp; team are aware of it.</p>

<p>2). Under my definition of the extent of how well a server is emulated I argue that in order to properly emulate Runescape and be a proper piece of emulation software this isn’t anything that is extraneous under any circumstance so is a moot point. Serving assets also recently has been found to be distributed across ALL Runescape nodes because the cache for Runescape holds server sided configurations used in their implementation. This should be taken into consideration but is fairly moot under the premise that it isn’t required to properly emulate the Runescape game however it sheds light on a method to solve solutions that you will come across when trying to organize assets.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not sure what you mean by ‘assets’ here. Are you talking about the fact that the client grabs the cache from the world server you loaded the applet from? I thought this is well known and I don’t see how it means there is a problem with Apollo’s implementation of ondemand/JAGGRAB?</p>

<p>The amount of snippets that are Apollo plugins, with the included consideration of the lack of popularity, is &lt;1%.

<p><span class="bbcode-b">The design of content was implemented in such a way that people can add or remove plugins from the emulation platform. Plugin functionality is expected to be isolated by design, with of course dependent plugins being apart of inline functionality. Therefore, since plugins are expected to be isolated by design and in this design the nature of how messaging handling is implemented it’s impossible for plugins to understand what responsibility of functionality they encompass. Certain plugins may consume messages before they are propagated to an awaiting message handler in another plugin by the nature of isolation. This leads to issues of functionality of design where with this system you put the developer in a black box where in order to fully understand the system they have to understand all of the implemented plugins. This goes against the vision of design, and therefore is illogical.</span></p>

<p>Already knew about this problem during development. Ideas for solutions would be appreciated instead of long waffling posts <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Most of the motivation for this system was really such that the default behaviour of carrying out a particular action could be overriden (which I think would be useful for things like custom minigames&amp;quests etc.)</p>
<p>Given the above, I think a solution would be to categorize handlers into groups - for lack of better words, let’s call these VERIFY, OVERRIDE and DEFAULT. VERIFY handlers would be added to the front of the pipeline (these are the ones Apollo adds by default to prevent cheating), OVERRIDE to the middle and DEFAULT to the end. This would probably suffice for most of the things people wanted to do with their plugins: multiple plugins could register OVERRIDE handlers for their special cases, and there’d be a standard plugin for things like woodcutting, which would register a single DEFAULT handler for the normal functionality.</p>
<p>[quote=“sini, post:1, topic:552864”]The lack of functionality, although enough to turn most of the public domain away from using Apollo, isn’t entirely present in most sources. It wasn’t until recently that people concluded that the player ‘configs’ were actually the players game state. Method confided this in multiple people at a much earlier date but it hasn’t been even considered to be an Incorporated system in any source. Technically there is a very limited amount of data structures that describe the player save state; those being the skills, inventories, and variables. I use the word variable to define a key entry styled data structure which maps a unique integer, the id, to an integer value. This structure encompasses data for quests, object states, item states, and configurations. Variables are used with the player, npc, and even item model. We can confirm this from Runescript leaks. An synonym for this is meta data. Although the structure is very primitive.</p>
<p>All of these structures can be appended to models in such a way where in an extensible manner you can append or remove them without changing fields by assigning them unique identifiers that are registered in the context of the game environment. This is critical for scalable development, however it wouldn’t be minimally required for emulation development.</p>
<p>Under the intention of giving developers the power to have a wide array of functionality with plugins however, in Apollo I’d consider this a critical priority. I however did not think Graham had much of a game development background where he could implement these features in a logical manner. It’s possibly he didn’t consider it important. However it doesn’t make sense to implement this vision, the vision of easily deployable plugins, and not see through through with it.[/quote]</p>
<p>In JRuby you can monkey patch classes like the Player class to add new fields, and this is how plugins have kept extra per-player/NPC/etc. state <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I think the only problem here really is ensuring it’s loaded/saved - I didn’t work on this before releasing Apollo.</p>
<p>Implementing something akin to Netty’s <a href="http://netty.io/4.0/api/io/netty/util/AttributeMap.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">AttributeMap</a> interface could also be a solution to this.</p>

<p>As you note later on in the post, the earlier servers I worked on like Shard, rs2d and Hyperion all had more content than Apollo did (at release), although I don’t think they were as well-designed (which is the whole reason Apollo exists… it’s basically Hyperion v2).</p>
<p>As Major argued earlier, I think Apollo does have a lot of stuff in the plugin system &amp; server itself that makes implementing content easier like the task/action system, which I assume is the kind of thing you’re talking about when you say ‘content system’?</p>

<p>you do realize major has been leeching all of his content since he entered into the private server scene? If you were to look at Apollo in Open Source you’d realize half of the content is probably taken directly from the snippets section at Rune–Locus LOL.</p>

        <p>No need to be rude Casey.</p>
<p>I think you and I Graham can both conclude you never really worked out the precise behavior of actions in Runescape because much of how actions work involve line of sight. Actions are triggered when a certain number of tiles of line of sight are gained. I haven’t checked to see if Major implemented this, but distance based actions without this usually were very limiting. I also found the way you implemented actions to create a lot of unnecessary boilerplate and hard to understand flow especially with the act of  having to keep an internal state to help divide the action into separate parts. It lead to a lot of confusion, and to note for each action you had to create a new instance. The model is pretty inefficient in my opinion, and the optimal way of course would be to have inline blocking delays but that’s difficult in most implementations although possible with subroutines. I think these reasons alone would hinder the efficiency of developers which lends to my argument of why would anyone, who is trying to use this for possible larger implications, settle for something such as that? Food for thought.</p>
<p>And you released this four years ago, Major took it upon himself recently to move forward on it, but a lot of these issues are pretty major. Even I know if you acknowledge that doesn’t change the fact they are still there and were oversight. I don’t see how you could suggest people use it out of the box, or anyone really. Even more advanced developers, this are sticking points that would lead to problems down the road for people and a lot of resources to try and fix.</p>
<p>So, conclusively I still stand by my points. And I think your post sheds some light that, Apollo needs some work. I think it’s fixable however. I’d just prefer that the public perception be a little more enlightened about how they should view the source. I think this topic did so.</p>
