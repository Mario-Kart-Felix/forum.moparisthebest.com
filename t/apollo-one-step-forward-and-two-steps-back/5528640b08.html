<p>Just because I don’t believe a server being 0.0005ms faster than your regular PI is unique doesn’t mean you should be mad.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Have you seen benchmarks comparing non-winterlove servers to servers like PI and Delta? Actually why am I even asking lol of course you haven’t</p>
<p>Without the “technical” side of Runescape private servers we would still be using those shitty czar servers from like 2007 that are incapable of sustaining an ideal amount of players. Like I said before, every single major server that has used winterlove has had to have a substantial amount of “technical” work done. If you’re planning on hosting, safe yourself the trouble and start with something remotely decent</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>And for your information, the server could hold 678 people. I did a test. And it is a Czar/Delta.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>A benchmark that consists of logging in bots and having them sit there idly isn’t an accurate benchmark :rolleyes:</p>
<p>Also in your “benchmark” did you even bother to profile? At the least, record the cycle times? Of course you didn’t.</p>
<p>Unless you’re using some sort of expensive $1500/month dedi (and even then) I highly doubt your server can sustain 678 real players</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The way you speak is as if you have ever had a server that had an active player base of 100+. The server ran on a 1GB VPS and it held 20 people no problem. I never expected 30+ to play the server, especially in 2015, regardless of it being unique or whatnot. So in my opinion, the server’s performance was perfect for the player base I achieved.</p>
<p>I did a lot of modifications to the source and client all on my own. I spent <span class="bbcode-b">a lot</span> of time fixing the <span class="bbcode-b">many</span> flaws within the original source. And I’m not just talking about “switching” and junk like that. I’m talking about complete game-breaking flaws. But overall, it did help in the long run. There was not 1 incident in which I was required to alter the security of the server in the many months of it being online. So I must have done something right if I managed to make a secure Czar.</p>
<p>And that “shitty Czar” became one of the most original servers within the past few years, and was semi-successful. When people contemplate a server they are going to dedicate their time to, the casual gamer isn’t going to be too concerned which server is milliseconds faster than the other (unless the server was a disaster performance wise). No, they consider the actual content of the server.</p>
<p>Can you show me a piece of work that you did that achieved atleast 20+ players? This isn’t meant to be condescending. I don’t care how unoriginal the server is.<br>
[/quote]You do realize that those who purposely go out seeking to exploit servers for self gain like people from <a href="http://abusewith.us/" rel="nofollow noopener">abusewith.us</a> only hit the larger servers. Guaranteed if you had an active playerbase of 100+ they would have hit you so hard you would have turned the server off.</p>
<p>You can’t talk about how good your security is when no one was there to exploit it. It was a delta, there were security flaws as much as you don’t want to admit it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well, good thing is none of what you actually said had taken place. Now you’re just assuming things.</p>
<p>I’m not bragging about the security of the server. I’m just stating I never ran into any problems.</p>
<p>What is so hard to understand, If you’re going to actually put a server up to the public, invest some of your time thinking of something creative over just the technical part of the server. And since I have proven that I can make something extremely unique to do with RSPS, I think I know what I’m talking about on that field.</p>
<p>You don’t see me trying to argue with the programmers over coding, because I’m sure they know much more than I know. It should be the same vise versa regarding the content of the server, as you should respect the opinion I have on that matter. And if you still are trying to debate with me over uniqueness of an RSPS, expect me to be involved.<br>
[/quote]How am I assuming things? I worked for Near Reality for a short time and in that time we boomed playercount up to 100+ and in that time <a href="http://abusewith.us/" rel="nofollow noopener">abusewith.us</a> started to target the server and find exploits. They destroyed the economy in a matter of days and there was a complete economy reset which devastated the player base. I don’t understand how you could even attempt to believe I am “assuming” things as said things actually DID take place.</p>
<p>The fact that you’re still here arguing against the whole community about how you’re “so unique” and how your delta with 1.5+ customs makes your server unique. You just need to sit down there and think about what you’re saying here.[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t need to think about anything here. My server is undoubtably unique. There was not 1 negative comment on my thread so I know what you people are saying is out of pure hatred. The fact I received 20+ active players on at all times means that “Delta with customs” had something about it.</p>
<p>I can just diminish any server I see with just a few words. An example: Near Reality was just a 317 with recolours.</p>
<p>Edit: there is a reason 1.5k customs were added into the server. Since the server is purely a “Rare collecting server”. Hence the name, the aim was to collect every item as possible, and since no item had a sort of benefit over the other item, each item was treated equally. Where have you seen another server where ashes had the same importance as an AGS?</p>
<p>And the reason the server was a Delta was because I began working on the server in 2010 on and off as a hobby. I taught myself basic Java through the internet on my spare time in order to fix many bugs that came along with the server.</p>
<p>All you people’s hate comments regarding my server to me means nothing. Because all the comments were positive, the server was semi-successful, and I know myself that the server was one of the most creative things within the past few years. I’m sorry that I just don’t think all your 718 “flawless pking!!” “Perfect Switching” and junk like that is considered unique.</p>

<p>I can understand you don’t like the criticism about your server, and those who are calling your server terrible can fudge off lol, but I don’t really see the point in collecting rares when those rares don’t have any uses, they’re jus there.

<p>Thankyou for being reasonable with me. I will indeed answer your question the best I can.</p>
<p>You are unable to recieve logs from cutting wood, and you are unable to recieve ashes from fires. Instead everytime you cut a tree for example you get a certain amount of coins for that certain tree you cut.</p>
<p>Items could be obtained through mystery boxes, which were obtained by recieving a certain amount of cash bags which were then exchanged. Every 2 weeks rares were put in the mystery box and the previous rares were removed, leaving the previous rares discontinued. Even when you do recieve a mystery box you can still recieve 1 gold piece instead of a rare. Therefore deciding the fate of the mystery box is entirely up to you.</p>
<p>Once you recieve a rare and would like to sell it, the only way for trading to take place is through drop trade. I completely disabled trading altogether. This is because I wanted trading to be a trust game, you need to be able to trust the person on the other side of the trade will not scam you.</p>
<p>The server was an extreme grind, but my small community loved it. PvM and PvP etc were still in the game, they just are not as significant as it is in other servers. I understand that people are not used to a big change in the way RSPS is played, hence why I remember reicieving a lot of confused questions from starter players, but I put in the time to answer all their questions as best as I could.</p>
<p>I am not looking for an argument here. All I meant by my original statement was that there was too much time being invested in the technical side of RSPS rather than the creative side. As hugely important the technicallity of an RSPS is, if more people atleast tried to come up with more unique concepts or content, it would make RSPS more interesting, for me anyway. I just felt I have knowledge in the creative part so I can give my opinion on other server’s originality. I don’t debate with programmers over coding. As I am Meerly a novice when it comes to Java development.</p>
<p>Again, I hope I answered your question and Thankyou for being reasonable.</p>

<p>Perhaps people will take you more seriously if you don’t claim superiority over all others. Quite honestly, I haven’t seen a “Java guru” around here claim they are the best.

People <span class="bbcode-b">acknowledged</span> them as such, they didn’t self-proclaim it. For example, the man who made this:<br>

This was a full RSPS think tank, and this was only a fraction of what he offered to the community.</p>

<p>You know what, I agree with this. It’s just when Lare first said to me “you have never created anything unique so you can’t talk” it kind of made me a little confused. So I replied and showed him proof of my work and then others got involved saying my server wasn’t unique or creative. I knew they were lying but that hurts the most. Because I spent years on and off working on my one and only server.</p>
<p>Hopefully something benifital came out of all of this.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure he said “contributed.” As in a release or a tutorial or snippet. Like I and many others have so that we can see people promoting unique, rather than demotivating other peoples for not being unique.</p>

I worked for Near Reality for a short time and in that time we boomed playercount up to 100+ and in that time <a href="http://abusewith.us/" rel="nofollow noopener">abusewith.us</a> started to target the server and find exploits.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>There must have been some gaping flaws in that server since <a href="http://abusewith.us/" rel="nofollow noopener">abusewith.us</a>’ forum seems to be full of idiots.[/quote]Honestly, they’re not the brightest, but they know how to exploit. Communities like that only make the server better in the long run as it helps the server by patching all the bugs.</p>
