<p>Ah yes sorry. Coroutine. Missed that. I agree, nothing to do about that.</p>
<blockquote>Premature optimization :) The number of objects allocated in the player update process in Apollo absolutely dwarfs the number of objects created for actions.</blockquote>
<p>Well, from a design perspective I feel it’s pretty not optimal. It puts too much responsibility in the action. Probably would be easier implementation wise to do a policy where the server checks if an interaction can be triggered knowing the current condition and let the implementation just define the action.</p>
<blockquote>DistancedAction has been in Apollo since the initial release for doing this, though it really should load the dimensions of objects from the cache to work better.</blockquote>
<p>Or logically, calculate a line of sight to the object. Most of the interactions work like that. NPCs, its 2 tiles, Object its just being adjacent but for some cases obviously you can be up to X tiles away. Doesn’t make sense to think not really taking an interest in something like that would make the cut for people trying to properly emulate Runescape.</p>
<blockquote>For most actions I don't think there are many states to manage - you generally have some period of time while your character is doing the action (e.g. mining, chopping wood, etc) and then a second state where you actually complete it by giving them the items, stopping the animation, etc.</blockquote>
<p>But with the vast amount of possible actions it adds up. I think that’s oversight.</p>
<blockquote>I note that you appear to have gone through and edited some of your posts/threads from 4 or 5 years ago to replace them with a single character, so I think making this post today talking about my "oversights" from back then (some of which I disagree with, some of which are just cos the community was different back then, and some of which are [b]probably[/b] genuine - I was never very good at playing RuneScape :p) is somewhat hypocritical ;)</blockquote>
<p>Let’s not pretend we like each other. If people can still quote you saying I ‘Butchered ScapeEmu’ from two years I think I deserve some leeway. But you know I do respect your contributions. I had my own reasons for removing my research I did and some of that stuff was pretty useful. But ah! Don’t try and turn this. Let’s stay on point here.</p>
<p>Hey, probably you can admit that there are genuine reasons and I can probably admit that maybe Apollo is a better option for certain purposes. For the general public? No. I won’t admit that. I will advocate against that. Anyone on Mopar who feels like it’s important to know that just has to read this thread and they’ll have a decent idea of why it may not be for them.</p>
<blockquote>Because despite the fact that there are some [b]minor problems[/b], on the whole it's still better than the alternatives if you want to write a server on top of a well-programmed base.

<p>…minor? The plugin system issue is minor? The action system issues where properly emulating various features is minor? I mean err. Not in my opinion.</p>
<p>I think I should have not directly specified this at you but more or less at your little cult that advocate Apollo I see pop up a lot. Not specifically here, more on R-S.</p>
<blockquote>Because it's better than the model used in most wL-esque servers where you have a bunch of timer variables (one per type of action) that are incremented on every call to process().</blockquote>
<p>Yes, but given their source has more content, most of the larger servers fix these issues.</p>
<p>I still advocate people use PI/Delta/Runesource</p>
<p>AND, speaking of Blakeman you know what I miss about him is that even though people will rail him about how Runesource isn’t as good as people may make it out to be he did complete the design to his specifications. It’s like a better PI/Delta. I think Apollo, from this conversation and from what I take from your responses, wasn’t entirely finished obviously but still has a lot of the original problems from 4 years ago. So. What do you think my conclusion on that is?</p>
<p>It bothers me that multiple people, just in general, think that they have to save the community from their practices and usher in a new era have you where people will be singing songs and writing content in scripts. I don’t think you wrote much content ever because if you did you would have spent more time assuring that people could do so efficiently. That’s really where we’re lacking in the sort of research and development, if you could describe it. I don’t even think you spent much time trying to observe Runescape or take into account the various different packets in the client or experimenting with different ideas. Because if you did, Apollo would have been used more and you cannot suggest to people that they should use it when you don’t have what may be their best interest at heart which is developing content in an efficient manner. That’s what a lot of GOOD projects boil down to. The speed, everything else? That comes (close) second.</p>

<p>But with the vast amount of possible actions it adds up. I think that’s oversight.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>In the worst case scenario let’s say each player starts one action per tick (given many actions take several ticks I doubt this would ever happen). That’s only 2000 allocations per tick assuming 2k players are online, and this really is the worst case.</p>
<p>Looking at the updating code:</p>
<ul>
<li>there’s already 6k allocations per tick allocating the SynchronizationTask objects (3 per player)</li>
<li>for each player in your local view, one SynchronizationSegment (what was I thinking when I named this stuff…) object is allocated (so let’s assume worst case 255 per player, so that’s 2000*255 objects)</li>
<li>and then above that there are the SynchronizationBlock objects themselves, though Apollo does try to re-use those where possible</li>
</ul>
<p>even excluding the blocks, that’s &gt;500k allocations per tick when you have 2k players. This is almost certainly the area where you’d want to optimize allocations, the actions are insignificant by comparison.</p>

<p>Hey, probably you can admit that there are genuine reasons and I can probably admit that maybe Apollo is a better option for certain purposes. For the general public? No. I won’t admit that. I will advocate against that. Anyone on Mopar who feels like it’s important to know that just has to read this thread and they’ll have a decent idea of why it may not be for them.</p>

</aside>
<p>Most of the ‘general public’ here probably don’t desire to be programming at all - whether it’s using a wL-derived server, or using Apollo.</p>
<p>I first heard about private servers from some of my friends, who knew I could already program and wanted me to help them set one up. I suspect a lot of the people here want to do something similar: set up a server for themselves and their friends to play on. The programming they have to do to achieve that is just a means to an end - none of the people who introduced me to RSPS have done any programming since.</p>

<p>I don’t have anything to do with Apollo any more, and I don’t exactly think there’s a cult around it either.

<blockquote>
<p>Because if you did, Apollo would have been used more</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>As other people have said earlier on in this thread, I think it’s not used because it doesn’t have much pre-existing content. Going back to the point about me being introduced to RSPS by friends who wanted me to help me set one up… all they cared about was how much content already existed in the server (which back in 2006 wasn’t much given servers were still new :p). If development on Apollo continues and it amasses a large number of plugins then I think it’d meet this criterion and end up being used more… but obviously, as Major alluded to, far more people have been hacking on wL-derived servers for a long time, so it’s quite a lot of effort to catch up.</p>

        <p>i personally think there’s a couple of things that put people off Apollo, and none of them have to do with having a poor “content system” (which I don’t think is true in the first place)</p>
<ul>
<li>lack of usage</li>
</ul>
<p>it’s lack of usage causes even more lack of usage (if that makes sense)</p>
<p>right when someone joins a private server community they are bombarded by delta and PI and Runesource and subconsciously they make the decision that those servers and the best to use (because they are the most widely used). assuming they have no programming background (which most people first joining don’t), how are they supposed to know any better?</p>
<ul>
<li>like Graham stated, a lot of people don’t care about being “programmers”</li>
</ul>
<p>so in this case, if they want to use PI or Delta or whatever else, why is that an issue?</p>
<ul>
<li>a lot of people are intimidated by it</li>
</ul>
<p>this is a really really big problem, and i can speak for myself in that i’ve felt this (and still do to some extent). a lot of capable people who could potentially be contributing to Apollo feel as if they aren’t competent enough and would rather just stick with what they’re comfortable with. that’s (part of the reason) why a lot of people would rather write their own servers that are less-shitty than the current popular alternatives over using Apollo</p>
<hr>
<p>i also feel as if “not having enough content” isn’t a real reason that can account for Apollo’s lack of usage. there are frameworks released from time and time and people eat them up even though there’s 0 content in them, and why? no clue. i released a server that literally has combat, two skills, and a minigame and people ate it up, and why? no clue. i don’t think Apollo’s lack of usage can be accounted to the code in Apollo itself but more the way it’s viewed in the community, the people who advocate for it, and most importantly <span class="bbcode-b">how</span> they advocate for it</p>

        <p>[quote=“Majorr, post:17, topic:552864”][/quote]Every single thing you say is to derail, you never build up anything besides your own work, can’t give credit where it’s due and can’t for the love of God respect another person’s opinion. I think you’ve proven that plenty of times for the reasons you banned me on R-S (without even knowing it was me). You’ve banned so many accounts for absolutely no reason and you have no idea which accounts they are. You and the rest of R-S mods are the most abusive staff members I have ever seen on the face of the planet. Just yesterday I registered another account and was banned for talking about my CS:GO hack. Permanent ban: phishing. How about the time you banned me from the shoutbox for 300 hours for saying “a woman shouldn’t be able to be president”? Or the time you said you would not talk to me (without knowing it was me) because I said that trickle-down economics can work? Or the time you said that people who don’t support Bernie Sanders shouldn’t even be considered human? How about the time where I asked why R-S moderators are so quick to ban people (after waiting 80 hours to get back on shoutbox) and was instantly banned for another 80 hours, reason: don’t like it? go somewhere else.</p>
<p>The reason I don’t respect you is because you and your mates run R-S like North Korea. You’re in favor of a party that is all about individual liberty and rights yet you can’t handle another opinion?</p>
