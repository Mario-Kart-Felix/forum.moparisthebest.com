<p>There is no denying it. I made a highly unique server, you are hating because you did not. You’re just fooling yourself saying it isn’t. And because of this, I have the expertise in this field where I can give my opinion on other servers in terms of creativity.</p>
<p>All I’m saying is that you should invest more time in the creative side of RSPS than just the technical. This only applies to people who have the intentions to put a server online to the public.<br>

I have lost interest quite honestly is aiming for being purely “unique.” Nobody really appreciates it and if you change the game too much, not many play it. Its hard to get used to new formats.<br>

<p>This is not true.[/quote]<br>
I’m pretty sure I can say that based on experience of it happening for 2-3 servers of mine in the past.</p>

<p>The way you speak is as if you have ever had a server that had an active player base of 100+. The server ran on a 1GB VPS and it held 20 people no problem. I never expected 30+ to play the server, especially in 2015, regardless of it being unique or whatnot. So in my opinion, the server’s performance was perfect for the player base I achieved.</p>
<p>I did a lot of modifications to the source and client all on my own. I spent <span class="bbcode-b">a lot</span> of time fixing the <span class="bbcode-b">many</span> flaws within the original source. And I’m not just talking about “switching” and junk like that. I’m talking about complete game-breaking flaws. But overall, it did help in the long run. There was not 1 incident in which I was required to alter the security of the server in the many months of it being online. So I must have done something right if I managed to make a secure Czar.</p>
<p>And that “shitty Czar” became one of the most original servers within the past few years, and was semi-successful. When people contemplate a server they are going to dedicate their time to, the casual gamer isn’t going to be too concerned which server is milliseconds faster than the other (unless the server was a disaster performance wise). No, they consider the actual content of the server.</p>
<p>Can you show me a piece of work that you did that achieved atleast 20+ players? This isn’t meant to be condescending. I don’t care how unoriginal the server is.</p>

<p>Just because I don’t believe a server being 0.0005ms faster than your regular PI is unique doesn’t mean you should be mad.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Have you seen benchmarks comparing non-winterlove servers to servers like PI and Delta? Actually why am I even asking lol of course you haven’t</p>
<p>Without the “technical” side of Runescape private servers we would still be using those shitty czar servers from like 2007 that are incapable of sustaining an ideal amount of players. Like I said before, every single major server that has used winterlove has had to have a substantial amount of “technical” work done. If you’re planning on hosting, safe yourself the trouble and start with something remotely decent</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>And for your information, the server could hold 678 people. I did a test. And it is a Czar/Delta.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>A benchmark that consists of logging in bots and having them sit there idly isn’t an accurate benchmark :rolleyes:</p>
<p>Also in your “benchmark” did you even bother to profile? At the least, record the cycle times? Of course you didn’t.</p>
<p>Unless you’re using some sort of expensive $1500/month dedi (and even then) I highly doubt your server can sustain 678 real players</p>

<p>The way you speak is as if you have ever had a server that had an active player base of 100+. The server ran on a 1GB VPS and it held 20 people no problem.

<p>Well, good thing is none of what you actually said had taken place. Now you’re just assuming things.</p>
<p>I’m not bragging about the security of the server. I’m just stating I never ran into any problems.</p>
<p>What is so hard to understand, If you’re going to actually put a server up to the public, invest some of your time thinking of something creative over just the technical part of the server. And since I have proven that I can make something extremely unique to do with RSPS, I think I know what I’m talking about on that field.</p>
<p>You don’t see me trying to argue with the programmers over coding, because I’m sure they know much more than I know. It should be the same vise versa regarding the content of the server, as you should respect the opinion I have on that matter. And if you still are trying to debate with me over uniqueness of an RSPS, expect me to be involved.</p>

And also, the fact you have never had a server that had 20 or more players means you cannot bellitle me for achieving this and also suggests you are doing something wrong. <em>Cough</em> not creative <em>cough</em>.</p>
<p>let me make this clear, if you are thinking about posting your server to the public, stop focusing soley on the technicallity of a RSPS, and invest time in the creative aspect. If you actually disagree with this then you are plain stupid. Everything I’m saying I back it up.</p>

<p>Hey look, its another illiterate fool who is deeply salty for some reason.</p>
<p>Shame the comments on my server back up your nonsense. Oh wait, you don’t have a clue what you’re talking about. It is the non-bright children like you who obviously wouldn’t understand the concept. The moment you said “15 ashes for Dclaws” I stopped reading because you have no clue what you’re talking about, you cannot express yourself to save your life and you are deeply mad.</p>
<p>Everything is equally rare because the ecconomy is run by items. The server was not a PvM or PvP server therefore dclaws has no significance. But you cannot read so obviously you didn’t know that. I honestly cannot even reply to half of the things you said because I don’t even understand the crap you typed.</p>
<p>Edit: Regarding your donator rank theory, I did add the new icons? So this proves you don’t know what you’re talking about, again…<br>
And I actually removed the whole “trade with” in general. If you wanted to view other people’s items you could check people’s banks. However I actually think that you don’t realise that drop trading was the only way to trade items.<br>
The server being unmoderated was due to the fact I can control my emotions (which you can’t). There was nothing in the server that could have been an offence. Scamming, flaming, spamming etc all were allowed. I don’t care. I got 20+ active players at all times so it mustve been good enough if people decided to stay.</p>
<p>TL;DR My server is 100% unique, you’re just mad. The comments on my server prove this and you cannot type to save your pathetic life. You are not very bright.</p>

<p>Have you seen benchmarks comparing non-winterlove servers to servers like PI and Delta? Actually why am I even asking lol of course you haven’t</p>
<p>Without the “technical” side of Runescape private servers we would still be using those shitty czar servers from like 2007 that are incapable of sustaining an ideal amount of players. Like I said before, every single major server that has used winterlove has had to have a substantial amount of “technical” work done. If you’re planning on hosting, safe yourself the trouble and start with something remotely decent</p>

<p>And for your information, the server could hold 678 people. I did a test. And it is a Czar/Delta.</p>

<p>A benchmark that consists of logging in bots and having them sit there idly isn’t an accurate benchmark :rolleyes:</p>
<p>Also in your “benchmark” did you even bother to profile? At the least, record the cycle times? Of course you didn’t.</p>
<p>Unless you’re using some sort of expensive $1500/month dedi (and even then) I highly doubt your server can sustain 678 real players</p>

<p>The way you speak is as if you have ever had a server that had an active player base of 100+. The server ran on a 1GB VPS and it held 20 people no problem. I never expected 30+ to play the server, especially in 2015, regardless of it being unique or whatnot. So in my opinion, the server’s performance was perfect for the player base I achieved.</p>
<p>I did a lot of modifications to the source and client all on my own. I spent <span class="bbcode-b">a lot</span> of time fixing the <span class="bbcode-b">many</span> flaws within the original source. And I’m not just talking about “switching” and junk like that. I’m talking about complete game-breaking flaws. But overall, it did help in the long run. There was not 1 incident in which I was required to alter the security of the server in the many months of it being online. So I must have done something right if I managed to make a secure Czar.</p>
<p>And that “shitty Czar” became one of the most original servers within the past few years, and was semi-successful. When people contemplate a server they are going to dedicate their time to, the casual gamer isn’t going to be too concerned which server is milliseconds faster than the other (unless the server was a disaster performance wise). No, they consider the actual content of the server.</p>
<p>Can you show me a piece of work that you did that achieved atleast 20+ players? This isn’t meant to be condescending. I don’t care how unoriginal the server is.<br>
[/quote]You do realize that those who purposely go out seeking to exploit servers for self gain like people from <a href="http://abusewith.us/" rel="nofollow noopener">abusewith.us</a> only hit the larger servers. Guaranteed if you had an active playerbase of 100+ they would have hit you so hard you would have turned the server off.</p>
<p>You can’t talk about how good your security is when no one was there to exploit it. It was a delta, there were security flaws as much as you don’t want to admit it.</p>

<p>Well, good thing is none of what you actually said had taken place. Now you’re just assuming things.</p>
<p>I’m not bragging about the security of the server. I’m just stating I never ran into any problems.</p>
<p>What is so hard to understand, If you’re going to actually put a server up to the public, invest some of your time thinking of something creative over just the technical part of the server. And since I have proven that I can make something extremely unique to do with RSPS, I think I know what I’m talking about on that field.</p>
<p>You don’t see me trying to argue with the programmers over coding, because I’m sure they know much more than I know. It should be the same vise versa regarding the content of the server, as you should respect the opinion I have on that matter. And if you still are trying to debate with me over uniqueness of an RSPS, expect me to be involved.[/quote]How am I assuming things? I worked for Near Reality for a short time and in that time we boomed playercount up to 100+ and in that time <a href="http://abusewith.us/" rel="nofollow noopener">abusewith.us</a> started to target the server and find exploits. They destroyed the economy in a matter of days and there was a complete economy reset which devastated the player base. I don’t understand how you could even attempt to believe I am “assuming” things as said things actually DID take place.</p>
<p>The fact that you’re still here arguing against the whole community about how you’re “so unique” and how your delta with 1.5+ customs makes your server unique. You just need to sit down there and think about what you’re saying here.</p>

<p>There must have been some gaping flaws in that server since <a href="http://abusewith.us/" rel="nofollow noopener">abusewith.us</a>’ forum seems to be full of idiots.</p>
