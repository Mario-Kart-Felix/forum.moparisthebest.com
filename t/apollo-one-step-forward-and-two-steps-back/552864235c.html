<p>First of all, shut up, you are the one who doesn’t have a clue what you’re talking about. And second, That link right there gives me the right to criticise any server in which I deem to be garbage. Even if you wanted to create something unique, you physically could not because you do not have the creativity that certain people possess.</p>
<p>And for your information, the server could hold 678 people. I did a test. And it is a Czar/Delta.</p>
<p>TL;DR I can say whatever I want about all your un-unique servers, but you cannot.</p>

<p>Before prancing on lare, do you even know what he has done besides technical aspects of RSPS? Here’s some example:<br>
<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="d7GCInAlbOU" data-youtube-title="My day/night system and other features [Survival]" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div><br>
<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="0Q__9aBMBvY" data-youtube-title="Adonia - The Beginning | Cutscene showoff" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div><br>
And this is 2 years ago! I wonder what other amazing work he has produced that we haven’t seen.</p>
<p>I too have done alot of things which the community has deemed to be “unique,” so just because you believe your work is unique, doesn’t mean you are the only person. Here’s a list of my work:</p>
<p><a href="http://pastebin.com/BLPdnk1W" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://pastebin.com/BLPdnk1W</a></p>
<p>Stop being a narcissistic asshole. I don’t march up to everyone and claim I’m superior to them because I can think of creative things, hell, I even doubt that my ideas are creative sometimes because that’s an opinion. I let the community decide if what I make is unique, and they say that it is, so I state that I make “unique” ideas. I don’t self-proclaim my ideas to be unique.</p>
<p>I have lost interest quite honestly in aiming for being purely “unique.” Nobody really appreciates it and if you change the game too much, not many play it. Its hard to get used to new formats. You’re a “runescape” private server, your audience is runescape players.</p>
<p>The reason as to why I find your comment so much of a bother to me is that you are so close minded. Lare is right,</p>

<p>you haven’t contributed anything unique/interesting yourself</p>

</aside>
<p>Hint the word “contributed.” Alot of the work I linked you to are ideas I released to the public so people could use them for their servers. Some of the work are even full fledged servers that I have released that have been praised countlessly in both MoparScape and Rune-Server for contributing something “unique” to the community for them to actually be able to use and see the code behind. The amount of times I have been told by people that I am their “inspiration” to get into or back into unique aspects of RSPS makes me really glad to know that I have atleast made some sort of impact on the RSPS community, rather than bashing people like you do.</p>
<p>Awaiting another witty comment by you.</p>

<p>First of all, shut up, you are the one who doesn’t have a clue what you’re talking about. And second, That link right there gives me the right to criticise any server in which I deem to be garbage. Even if you wanted to create something unique, you physically could not because you do not have the creativity that certain people possess.</p>
<p>And for your information, the server could hold 678 people. I did a test. And it is a Czar/Delta.</p>
<p>TL;DR I can say whatever I want about all your un-unique servers, but you cannot.[/quote]<br>

<p>you’re missing the point… i didn’t say that to be “elitist” because i haven’t contributed anything worthwhile myself, my point is that you can’t go around prancing stuff like “DERES NOTHING UNIQUE HERE” when you haven’t contributed anything unique/interesting yourself</p>

<p>Before prancing on lare, do you even know what he has done besides technical aspects of RSPS? Here’s some example:<br>
<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="d7GCInAlbOU" data-youtube-title="My day/night system and other features [Survival]" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div><br>

And this is 2 years ago! I wonder what other amazing work he has produced that we haven’t seen.</p>
<p>I too have done alot of things which the community has deemed to be “unique,” so just because you believe your work is unique, doesn’t mean you are the only person. Here’s a list of my work:</p>
<p><a href="http://pastebin.com/BLPdnk1W" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://pastebin.com/BLPdnk1W</a></p>
<p>Stop being a narcissistic asshole. I don’t march up to everyone and claim I’m superior to them because I can think of creative things, hell, I even doubt that my ideas are creative sometimes because that’s an opinion. I let the community decide if what I make is unique, and they say that it is, so I state that I make “unique” ideas. I don’t self-proclaim my ideas to be unique.</p>
<p>I have lost interest quite honestly is aiming for being purely “unique.” Nobody really appreciates it and if you change the game too much, not many play it. Its hard to get used to new formats. You’re a “runescape” private server, your audience is runescape players.</p>
<p>The reason as to why I find your comment so much of a bother to me is that you are so close minded. Lare is right,</p>

<p>First of all, if you compare my former server to your current server, I’m sure my server is hands down a more unique concept of partaking in a RSPS. You state multiple “updates” except none of them do I don’t condemn as being creative. I portray my server as creative, and so does everyone else, because it is. I actually created a completely different concept of playing a runescape emulation. My server was more than “just unique” let’s be honest here. And because my server is undoubtably one of the most unique server made within the past few years, I think I have the right to state my honest opinion on the current state of servers being made nowadays.</p>
<p>That being said, you obviously have accomplished much within the dying RSPS community. However, I still cannot see the “uniqueness” behind your server. I’m sure your server is very stable etc.</p>
<p>Again like I said to another fool, it isn’t bashing, it’s called giving you people a dose of the truth. I stand by my original statement in which more time is focused on the technical side of an RSPS over the creative side. I do understand that there are many people here who are not capable of coming up with unique concepts, and therefore I have no problem with that. But don’t dismiss the idea until you have atleast attempted it.</p>
<p>Also, I’m not advertising, because I decided to close the server. I will never be making another server again.</p>

<p>you’re missing the point… i didn’t say that to be “elitist” because i haven’t contributed anything worthwhile myself, my point is that you can’t go around prancing stuff like “DERES NOTHING UNIQUE HERE” when you haven’t contributed anything unique/interesting yourself</p>
<p>besides, i know most ppl here don’t like r-s (for valid reasons) but there’s tons of interesting projects and stuff over there that people are doing[/quote]</p>

<p>First of all, shut up, you are the one who doesn’t have a clue what you’re talking about. And second, That link right there gives me the right to criticise any server in which I deem to be garbage. Even if you wanted to create something unique, you physically could not because you do not have the creativity that certain people possess.</p>
<p>And for your information, the server could hold 678 people. I did a test. And it is a Czar/Delta.</p>
<p>TL;DR I can say whatever I want about all your un-unique servers, but you cannot.</p>

<p>Uh ok let’s start advertising our servers.</p>

<p>Before prancing on lare, do you even know what he has done besides technical aspects of RSPS? Here’s some example:<br>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7GCInAlbOU" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7GCInAlbOU</a><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q__9aBMBvY" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q__9aBMBvY</a><br>
And this is 2 years ago! I wonder what other amazing work he has produced that we haven’t seen.</p>
<p>I too have done alot of things which the community has deemed to be “unique,” so just because you believe your work is unique, doesn’t mean you are the only person. Here’s a list of my work:</p>
<p><a href="http://pastebin.com/BLPdnk1W" rel="nofollow noopener">http://pastebin.com/BLPdnk1W</a></p>
<p>Stop being a narcissistic asshole. I don’t march up to everyone and claim I’m superior to them because I can think of creative things, hell, I even doubt that my ideas are creative sometimes because that’s an opinion. I let the community decide if what I make is unique, and they say that it is, so I state that I make “unique” ideas. I don’t self-proclaim my ideas to be unique.</p>
<p>I have lost interest quite honestly is aiming for being purely “unique.” Nobody really appreciates it and if you change the game too much, not many play it. Its hard to get used to new formats. You’re a “runescape” private server, your audience is runescape players.</p>
<p>The reason as to why I find your comment so much of a bother to me is that you are so close minded. Lare is right,</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>you haven’t contributed anything unique/interesting yourself</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Hint the word “contributed.” Alot of the work I linked you to are ideas I released to the public so people could use them for their servers. Some of the work are even full fledged servers that I have released that have been praised countlessly in both MoparScape and Rune-Server for contributing something “unique” to the community for them to actually be able to use and see the code behind. The amount of times I have been told by people that I am their “inspiration” to get into or back into unique aspects of RSPS makes me really glad to know that I have atleast made some sort of impact on the RSPS community, rather than bashing people like you do.</p>
<p>Awaiting another witty comment by you.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>First of all, if you compare my former server to your current server, I’m sure my server is hands down a more unique concept of partaking in a RSPS. You state multiple “updates” except none of them do I don’t condemn as being creative. I portray my server as creative, and so does everyone else, because it is. I actually created a completely different concept of playing a runescape emulation. My server was more than “just unique” let’s be honest here. And because my server is undoubtably one of the most unique server made within the past few years, I think I have the right to state my honest opinion on the current state of servers being made nowadays.</p>
<p>That being said, you obviously have accomplished much within the dying RSPS community. However, I still cannot see the “uniqueness” behind your server. I’m sure your server is very stable etc.</p>
<p>Again like I said to another fool, it isn’t bashing, it’s called giving you people a dose of the truth. I stand by my original statement in which more time is focused on the technical side of an RSPS over the creative side. I do understand that there are many people here who are not capable of coming up with unique concepts, and therefore I have no problem with that. But don’t dismiss the idea until you have atleast attempted it.</p>
<p>Also, I’m not advertising, because I decided to close the server. I will never be making another server again.[/quote]im convinced youre trolling at this point</p>

<p>No thanks, I will continue to state my opinion, however constructive/non constructive it may be. It is just a fact that you people’s creativity is not on the same par as maybe your technical side may be. Why everyone is butthurt is beyond me. Just because I don’t believe a server being 0.0005ms faster than your regular PI is unique doesn’t mean you should be mad.</p>
<p>It’s just the truth, create something that is <span class="bbcode-b">actually</span> unique and creative, PM me and I’ll take a look.</p>

<p>I must have pulled a string or something. let’s be realistic here. What you said about my server is all untrue and you’re just saying that due to the fact you cannot control your emotions. Sure, there was a lot of customs in the server (1.5k+) but that was due to the fact the server is solely based on “rare-collecting”. A unique concept somebody like you would never understand because you aren’t the brightest of people. Also what bug is it you’re talking about? I removed trading on purpose you fool XD. I made drop-trade the only method of transactions in order to create a risk within itself. Once again you didn’t know that. The features in the server were things like “drop trade only” and “unmoderated server” or even “only monster drops are mystery boxes”, you fool.</p>
<p>Also, let’s not mistake that I did not put any effort in the technical side of the server. If you were capable of reading, you would see it could hold 678 people. There was no problems security side too.</p>
<p>The comments alone on my server just justified my point. All positive. All you are is just mad. I am the only one of this forum who actually has made a <span class="bbcode-b">hugely</span> creative and unique server that reached a player base of 18-20 people online always, which in 2015 is very hard to achieve. once again, I have the right to say my opinion on other servers because I have made something that was unique. You haven’t. So you can’t say anything.</p>
<p>Tl;DR you’re just mad and none of what you said about my server is true. I have a creative advantage over everyone else on the forum in terms of RSPS.</p>

<p>There is no denying it. I made a highly unique server, you are hating because you did not. You’re just fooling yourself saying it isn’t. And because of this, I have the expertise in this field where I can give my opinion on other servers in terms of creativity.</p>
