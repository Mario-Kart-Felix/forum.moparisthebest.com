    <description>I know its off topic but i cant find where i would put this
i have windows xp on my mac desktop running loin osx and i most of the servers i downlaoded (sources) dont work as xp i guess is to old, as it shows that picture that the object cant be opened, so I downloaded vmware fusion on my macbook pro and am trying to install windows vista, but the torrent was i guess 2 disks and i cant find any windows vista ones that are 1 disk and in english

my question is :

How would i install vista with 2 disks using vmware fusion 4?/anything on my mac?

Can i make them into one iso and than use vmware?

Is there a way i could play on any server using xp?

i downloaded runeedit or w.e that one is its from google and i cba to find the link as its 1am... it crashes when my client loads 100% and the person who relased it said i had a shitty computer so im getting vista on it since i have xp limited to my auto swicther (which doesnt work now -.-)

any way i could play+use edit + the server on xp? (basically not have i cash) its java is upto date

please no trolls/useless replies if your not gana help be good and click the back button

and sorry if its in the wrong section i dont know where else i could post this

Thanks for any help what so ever!
