              <p>We’re at an interesting point. There has definitely been an increase in the number of casual gamers. So I believe shorter games will start to be developed because of the potential money that they can bring it. Hearthstone is a great example of a casual game that has found it’s fair share of popularity.</p>
<p>We’re going to start to see the decline of COD-like shooters and we may start to see some innovation. The last game didn’t sell as well as the previous and this would have been noted. Titanfall is a great example of a shooter than innovates just a little bit but doesn’t alienate the crowd that they’re used to dealing with. Interesting enough, Titanfall is halfway between a standard military shooter and some previous twitch shooters. Due to the age group that it attracts, we may see it all move even closer to the twitch shooters as that genre is relatively new to that age bracket (Quake and Unreal). There’s also a brand new Unreal engine that just begs for another UT.</p>
<p>The MOBA genre will follow what I said about and start to lean towards the more casual. It’s going to be refined a lot and Blizzard have taken the first big step in doing this with Heroes of the Storm. It’s short rounds, tankier heroes, emphasis on teamplay and doesn’t have chat with the opponents. They recognize that the community is toxic when it comes to MOBAs and are trying to avoid that in their game. There’s no need for that 20 or so minutes of creep farming.</p>
<p>We’re going to see a lot more mobile games and it’s going to follow the standard freemium model. In fact, most future games will try to implement this model in one way or another. There’s a good chance they will even double dip by having an upfront cost, micro-transactions and DLCs. Game prices will stay the same and subscription games will drop in popularity. As well as this, we may see the MMO genre slowly lose it’s popularity. EQ:Next will most likely be the next challenger if Wildstar doesn’t get anywhere. EOS will be popular at first but lost players fairly rapidly.</p>
<p>Virtual Reality will be introduced properly in 2015 and Sony will possibly bundle their headset with their Playstation. The Oculus will be used for the SteamBox that will gain popularity around the same time.</p>
<p>They are my predictions.</p>
