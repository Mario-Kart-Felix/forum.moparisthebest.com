Information on Promotion

It would be nice if you had Runescape related Subscribers in which you will upload a video

about the server etc.
Information on Owner/President

My names Tyler . I am 16, I come from Washington . I have coded RSPS&#39;s for

18-2 4months. I have run 1 pretty succesful servers over the time which has made me some profit

, but the thing that stops me from keep on going is that I had too much

work to do and had little help. I feel that this plan of mine has a great deal of

potential and within a few weeks we will have a massively succesful server.


Rewards

Once accepting your position, I will not lie, it will be hard work and tiresome.

But if you are mature and responsible and work hard, you will be given a bigger

percentage of profits. Not only will you recieve IRL money, you will be an

official in a most likely huge community.
