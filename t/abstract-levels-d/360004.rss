    <title>Abstract levels? :D</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/abstract-levels-d/360004</link>
    <description>some of you guys told me about it with my pacman 2d game. i was wondering how i would go about doing this. or if i couldnt figure it out. maybe i could give one of you guys the source and do it for me :P you would get credit if u wanted

all i would need would be the base on how to do it, i could implement all the levels in myself. what do ya say?

either one works.</description>
