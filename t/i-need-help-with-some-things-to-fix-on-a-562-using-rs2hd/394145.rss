    <title>I need help with some things to fix on a 562 (using rs2hd)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-some-things-to-fix-on-a-562-using-rs2hd/394145</link>
    <description>As a new coder, I&#39;m actually very bad. So today, I am asking you, Moparscapers, to help me to code a couple of things. If you can find me a tutorial it would be appreciated or you can just tell me how to code if you feel like writing. Please be respectful, I am not english :S. 

[s]Ok, so the first thing that I would like to fix is the combat xp rate. Actually the rate is 4800xp so as you see, it is TOO much high. I wonder how can I slow it.[/s]

[s]After, I wonder how I can enable drops. (actually, when I drop something it disepears.)[/s]

Third, when I shoot any arrows, bolts, or even cannon balls, it doesn&#39;t use the projectiles. How can I make it use the projectiles ?

Fourth: I have the same problem with magic. When I cast a spell, it doesn&#39;t use runes. 

Finally, I wonder how I could add prayer curses. I know that I need sprites but what else? and how to add the effects, the gfx and everything ?

So thanks for replying.

<p>Projectile Dropping -</p>
<p><code>if(player.getEquipment().get(Equipment.SLOT_ARROWS) != null) {
			int arrow = player.getEquipment().get(Equipment.SLOT_ARROWS).getId();
			if(player.itemName("Crystal")) { //such as Crystal Bow, cuz no arrows used for it.
				return;
			}
			if (arrow &gt; 0) {
				player.getEquipment().deleteItem(arrow, 1);</code></p>
<p>It’s not the whole code, but the rest should be easy  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/cool.png?v=5" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"> . Also, be sure too keep the Crystal, as I put above, no arrows are used for it, but if your server needs arrows, they shouldn’t be used because that’s the point of the bow…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">
Using Runes too Cast Spells...

I'll give you a code, you copy and paste for every spell id &lt;3. 

[code]case 25://Wind strike
						if(!p.getInventory().contains(556, 1)|| !p.getInventory().contains(558, 1)) {
							p.sm("You do not have the correct runes in your inventory too cast this spell.");
							p.resetAttack();
						} else {
							if (p.MageTime == 0 &amp;&amp; p.getInventory().contains(556, 1) &amp;&amp; p.getInventory().contains(558, 1)) {
								p.getInventory().deleteItem(556, 1);
								p.getInventory().deleteItem(558, 1);
								gfx = 90;
								anim = 1162;
								projectile = 91;
								damage = 2;
								gfx2 = 92;
								req = 0;
								p.MageTime = 5;
								usingAncient = false;
							}
						}
						break;[/code]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cursed Prayers you would need too load atleast a 602 cache unless you can add the configs yourself. Anywho..

Hoped I helped you atleast with most of this  :rolleyes:[/quote]
