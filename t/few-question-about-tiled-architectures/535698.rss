    <title>Few question about tiled architectures</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/few-question-about-tiled-architectures/535698</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m trying to work out whether or not tiled architectures are truly a next-gen architectural paradigm, or if the supposed harsh reality of interconnect delay is just media hype. The usual example is the Itanium 2 processor, which consumes 130 Watts and sports a zero-cycle fully-bypassed 6-way issue integer execution core... but it does support enterprise-level computing with an RTL capacity of 96%.


I realise that good energy management is paramount and that current wide-issue processor designs rely on huge, global, centralised structures like associative instruction windows, but I just don&#39;t think the argument is convincing enough. These architectures reflect the parallelism inherent in VLSI structures and don&#39;t rely on complex logic to extract parallelism from sequential instruction streams, so why would we ever want to use them in a production environment?</description>

              <p>well shit me, I am honoured sir… it’s truly humbling to be in your presence. Anyway I think I’ve found the answer to my concerns here, and think the paradigm shift is more to do with thermal power dissipation and enterprise-scale energy efficiency.</p>
