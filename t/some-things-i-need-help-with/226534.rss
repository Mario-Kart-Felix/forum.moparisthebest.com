    <description>i am currently running a cheesescape pk 78 source, some things i need help with are:

I would like to add drops, i am a little confused on what to do because nothing i try seems to be working.

I would like to get rid the glitch where it always thinks you are in the wild.

I would like to out a global objects void in, i have no idea there.
