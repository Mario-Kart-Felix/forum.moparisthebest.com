[b]What is Repose?[/b]
[i]Repose started as a small little project I was working on after I quit development with another server. I have been working on this PI server for about three weeks now, and in that time most of it was spent removing content instead of adding it. After removing most of the content and such of the base server, it suddenly sparked inside of me that I should start making this server better.


There isn&#39;t much to show as of now, most of the content I&#39;ve added has been randomly chosen by my mind. And after only a few days of work, there hasn&#39;t been a lot of progress in the broad skills, but more in smaller areas. And to add to that, most of the work done has been collecting data and IDs so I can make everything in the server the way I want it to be, instead of someone else&#39;s design.


More will be added to these lists later once I think of something to add, or happen to add it to the server.[/i]

[i]Again, I do plan to add more to these two. It is pretty late right now, so I plan on continuing this tommorow, as well as posting updates as to what I have done.[/i]

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here is a list of updates. The reason I put this is here is so that I am almost forced to put whatever I program in here. Also I havent done anythin in the past few days.
[7:55 PM 11/22/2014] - Started smelting
[11:05 PM 11/22/2014] - Stopped smelting | Started magic PvP
[3:39 AM 11/23/2014] - Finished magic teleports, teleblock, and teleother (Done for today)
[6:06 PM 11/23/2014] - Not much done today to show, mostly bug fixing for magic. (Done for today)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I agree, to an extent. I know they're not anything unique or over the top, but it's nice to post something rather than nothing.
<blockquote>If one person gets the logs from the tree, does it stop everyone? Or does it act like runescape and wait a cycle, and then stop everyone? Or does it even stop them?</blockquote>
If two people are cutting the same tree, it will stop both of them once the tree is finished. It doesn't wait an extra cycle for the person that didn't get the final logs, but I suppose it could. 
<blockquote>Also, you shouldn't have had to "rewrite how objects are handled" for woodcutting... You should be able to use the same system for all skills that use objects.</blockquote>
The way it works now is a bit different. There is now a general class for objects that need to respawn, rather than it handling that within the woodcutting class or any other that requires an object to change without interaction.
<blockquote>Woodcutting and mining are nearly identical, except the animations are a bit different, and there's only 2 ores that have a limitless supply.</blockquote>
Indeed. I suppose mining wouldn't really need to be shown off. I just get off on showing off things I've accomplished.
<blockquote>I also couldn't tell in the video, (Mostly because someone had the playback set to like 5x the regular speed) are the stumps and rotations correct? Like does the tree spawn facing the same way it was before, or does it spawn to a default face (like 0)?</blockquote>
As far as I can tell, yes. Some of the stump IDs are incorrect, though, such as the maple stump and some of the different sized dead trees.

</aside>
<p>Well thanks! I only picked Ardougne as the first area because when I think about thieving I think about the countless of hours of grinding there. And also, the same as you, it’s nostalgiac because I remember paying people to thieve the silk stalls for me so I could sell the silk to the silk merchant.</p>
<p>As of now, I will be working on mining. So updates on that soon!</p>

<span class="bbcode-b">What is Repose?</span><br>
[i]Repose started as a small little project I was working on after I quit development with another server. I have been working on this PI server for about three weeks now, and in that time most of it was spent removing content instead of adding it. After removing most of the content and such of the base server, it suddenly sparked inside of me that I should start making this server better.</p>
<p>There isn’t much to show as of now, most of the content I’ve added has been randomly chosen by my mind. And after only a few days of work, there hasn’t been a lot of progress in the broad skills, but more in smaller areas. And to add to that, most of the work done has been collecting data and IDs so I can make everything in the server the way I want it to be, instead of someone else’s design.</p>
<p>More will be added to these lists later once I think of something to add, or happen to add it to the server.[/i]<br>
