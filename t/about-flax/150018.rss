    <description>Okay so I was trying to add flax today so I made the case
[code]                                          case 2646:
				if (actionTimer == 0) {
				sendMessage(&quot;You pick some flax&quot;);
				setAnimation(881);
				addItem(1779, 1);
		                            addSkillXP(50, 12);
				actionTimer = 3;
				}
				break;[/code]
You think it would work? But it doesn&#39;t. If you could help me with this please do so.
