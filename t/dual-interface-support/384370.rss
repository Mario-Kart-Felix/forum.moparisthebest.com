    <description>Any idea why even when I think I have a dual side menu working. (meaning You know the different tabs that allow you to select equipment inventory etc. Mine is freestanding by itself in my client. Respondent to hotkeys) I can&#39;t get it to allow you to have two different interface/tabs open at once interacting with both. It screws up.

Does anyone have the old client released a while back that had move-able freestanding sidebars/tabs?</description>
