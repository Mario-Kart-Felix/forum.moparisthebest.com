              <p><span class="bbcode-b">1. How long have you played on rs/rsps’s?</span><br>
Both RSPS and RS since ~06</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">2. What do you look for in a server?</span><br>
Fun content that doesn’t make you go bored after few minutes of playing, Especially original content that you never seen before which makes you feel that you want to actually continue on playing and not stop because you feel disgusted the fact that this has been made a thousand times before.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">3. What do you feel is missing in servers?</span><br>
Originality… Most servers i see are claiming to be 24/7 full specs and anims no dupes blabla full godwars etc… Which is extremely deterring for me as there is nothing different than any other server at all.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">4. If you could add one thing to a server what would it be?</span><br>
To be honest i think that new maps and regions around to be different would be amazing, it would give the feeling to explore around just like the first time you ever played RS, placing NPC’s and objects in the same map is seriously not different AT ALL when servers claim to be “original” it’s just the same shit. In that case i’d just rather have the same shit but different maps.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">5. Do you prefer servers which allow you to buy stuff with real money?</span><br>
I don’t mind if they offer people to buy stuff since every server needs money to run, I wouldn’t like if they were OP stuff on sale like instant strong weapons or extremely rare items that cost a fortune in game. It would be perfect if there was a solution in-between like mid-range powered stuff and not too expensive either.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">6. Do you donate/buy things?</span><br>
I would only choose to do so on one condition, Where the server would be very stable with many players and has been running for a while and i would actually enjoy it, Which makes me want to support the devs for doing a nice job not mainly to actually progress into the game.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">7. Do you prefer custom items or custom game content/ Or neither?</span><br>
Definitely content, items would be nice but content more likely.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">8. How often do you think quality bug-free updates should happen?</span><br>
Dev’s should work on releasing the updates on time meaning when they think the update is ready to be released and it’s actually worth releasing, Unlike critical bug patches which should be instant.</p>

RSPS since 2010</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">2. What do you look for in a server?</span><br>
Uniqueness and stability. Those are, for me, the most important thing in a server. I haven’t seen a unique server since that hunger games one. Also even if a server is very unique, if it aint stable and is prone to exploits which are game-ruining then there is no point playing it ( unless it is GodzHell which was flawed beyond believe but is still my all-time favourite server). I also only really play 317-474s, not the ones with higher revision graphics and stuff, I like my servers oldschool. I personally don’t really care about the presentation of a server, although it would help, as long at it’s unique and stable they’ve done enough for me to want to keep playing it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">3. What do you feel is missing in servers?</span><br>
Uniqueness.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">4. If you could add one thing to a server what would it be?</span><br>
Uniqueness.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">5. Do you prefer servers which allow you to buy stuff with real money?</span><br>
No, I would rather a server received its money via donations than them needing to give players the ability to get rich within seconds.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">6. Do you donate/buy things?<br>
</span>I donated on SoulSplit 3 years ago when it was actually a pretty decent server to play. Haven’t played it in a long time.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">7. Do you prefer custom items or custom game content/ Or neither? (Poll above)</span><br>
I really like custom items, I see many people don’t but it’s just interesting to see stuff like iPhones in a server but I suppose that’s just me.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">8. How often do you think quality bug-free updates should happen? (As soon as possible isn’t an answer)</span><br>
Whenever they are needed, except many owners don’t know how to fix the bugs anyway, which is a shame sometimes.</p>

              <p><span class="bbcode-b">1. How long have you played on rs/rsps’s?</span><br>
RS: At least 10 years.<br>
RSPS: like… 6-7?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">2. What do you look for in a server?</span><br>
Quality mostly. I look to see that the owner didn’t download a copy of the latest TrisidiaX or whatever garbage and just change the name… I look to see that the owner is actually TRYING to work on the server… And I hate when the owner plasters DONATOR ONLY CONTENT everywhere. That’s not the point of donating.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">3. What do you feel is missing in servers?</span><br>
Quality content and the server owners actually giving a shit about the server. Now it’s all about making quick money with donations.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">4. If you could add one thing to a server what would it be?</span><br>
Not really add. I’d do more removing. Most servers have too much donator only crap. And the shops are typically infested with leet gear that’s easy to obtain. From there, I’d add bug free skills and content.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">5. Do you prefer servers which allow you to buy stuff with real money?</span><br>
I can’t say I prefer it. It depends on the items, really. Items that give players an unfair advantage? Fuck that nonsense. Cosmetics, slight boosts, and some perks (Not game killing ofc)? I’m okay with that. Servers do need money to pay for the VPS and etc</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">6. Do you donate/buy things?</span><br>
I’ve done it like… once. And regretted it. So no, not really.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">7. Do you prefer custom items or custom game content/ Or neither? (Poll above)</span><br>
Custom items… Very, very rarely. They need to be peppered in, and need to have some quality. None of that 300 different colored Torva sets with a bunch of new names… Stuff like what Amy webb has produced… (there was another modeler but i couldn’t remember their name)<br>
Custom game content: <span class="bbcode-b">ALWAYS</span>. I’m sick and tired of every 317 server out there having the exact same npcs, slayer tasks, shops, minigames, everything.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">8. How often do you think quality <span class="bbcode-s">bug-free</span> updates should happen? (As soon as possible isn’t an answer)</span><br>
You can’t always guarantee it’s bug free. Another bug may sprout without you even knowing.<br>
I think you should have a scheduled day, or days, to post updates. Like runescape does.<br>
That way regardless of what’s added, the players know to expect something on those specified days.<br>
Not just “Oh, they’re updating… whenever”. I’d also think it should be around once a week, more than that in the alpha/beta stages of the server.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>I’ve played since 06 and RSPS since 07-08.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A owner that knows what he’s doing, takes initiative to interact with his members, plenty of updates, active forums with professional outlook of them and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The professional outlook on the communities (which I know this is a RSPS based thing and shouldn’t be taken all too serious since it’s a game but still… I would at least still expect people to have pride in their work and make it look good especially when advertising), creativity etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t know, I’ve always been a community-based or forum person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not really, and if it does offer that then that’s nice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’ve only donated to three communities that I felt deserved it while being apart of RSPS so I would say that the chance is rare. I never even donated to the one I was second owner of because Ikov bored the shit out of me (as far as the server goes that is).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah, I would like to see custom game content that came from the owner or developer(s). The idea of such content is rare to find while those who have these ideas never take them to that next level and then drop the idea/project which is saddening sometimes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I cannot answer this because this may vary upon the community and how a community interacts. The owner needs to understand this and maintain a balance between it being with ease and what time both should come out etc.</p>
