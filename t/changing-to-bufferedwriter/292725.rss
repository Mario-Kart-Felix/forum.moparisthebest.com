    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-to-bufferedwriter/292725</link>
    <description>ok i was thinking the play save and load that graham had didn&#39;t work out for me so i though why not change it so it saves and loads using the bufferedwriter but i don&#39;t know what i would change and i have no clue how to write it out so that it doesn&#39;t affect anything else but still saves and loads from a readable .txt file and not a incrypted file like .dat

[code]
	public PlayerSave loadGame(String playerName, String playerPass)
	{
		PlayerSave tempPlayer;


		try {
			ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(&quot;./savedGames/&quot;+playerName+&quot;.dat&quot;));
			tempPlayer = (PlayerSave) in.readObject();
			in.close();
		}
		catch(Exception e){
			return null;
		}
		return tempPlayer;
	}
[/code] how woud i change this ive already tryed but i failed at it =\ any help would be nice :D</description>
