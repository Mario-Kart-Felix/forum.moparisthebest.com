    <description>How do I make it to where shops sell 50 of an item when u go to buy 10. it is hard to buy runes and arrows at 10 at a time and u can always get 10 by making 2 fives and i know some clients have it so u buy 50 when u click buy 10. 

i wasn&#39;t sure if this was a server or a client issue so if i posted in the wrong place please tell me and i will repost it in the right place.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: July 31, 2009, 07:25:41 pm[/size][hr]does anyone know?</description>
