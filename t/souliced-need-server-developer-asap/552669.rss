    <title>Souliced - Need Server developer. ASAP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/souliced-need-server-developer-asap/552669</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m the owner of a server called Soul iced, I&#39;m looking for someone who can actually help code and develop the server along side with me as my old developer doesn&#39;t have time to anymore. If anyone is interested, the server is a 718 Citellum source. I&#39;ve done a few tweaks myself but I&#39;ll need someone help with the cache work, shops, combat and other tweaks.

My skype is : Jackhampson

if you&#39;re interested please feel free to add me.</description>
