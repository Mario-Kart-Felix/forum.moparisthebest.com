    <title>[PI] Spawning jad causes disconnect due to client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-spawning-jad-causes-disconnect-due-to-client/432749</link>
    <description>Hey everyone I have tried to fix this problem to no avail and I was wonder if anyone else has a fix to this problem. 
When I spawn the npc 2745 which is jad, it disconnects and I could spawn any other monster fine except for some giant npcs. I have tried to spawn it in the cfg file but all it does is cause repeatedly disconnects. Is there any fix?
People are telling me that models are outdated but I don&#39;t know if it is because spawning other monsters it also has a problem.

Thanks

Edited: 
I found the problem it was because of the client it didn&#39;t load the models correctly and when I use a new client it works, but I am looking for how to replace the models on the old client because its already fully coded.

the client with the messed up jad gives me this error when i spawn him-

Error: T2 - 65,81,208 - 21,2963,3388 - 5,-98,72,2,-32,0,-85,-81,-1,-32,0,32,-128
