I have already started and anyone who wants to join my server go ahead although im not very far my ip is 127.0.0.1. I am trying to make this a player community and will take all comments and questions into consideration. Plz tell me what you think a reasonalbe combat level to start new players out at. I also would like to know how to insert objects into the game i havent managed to figure it out. thank you and remember play on my server and give me feedback i promise to make this the best server yet because ill take all your suggestions.
