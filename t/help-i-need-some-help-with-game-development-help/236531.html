        <p>Hello,<br>
I’ve been studying up on C, C#, and C++ programming for a while. I started Java “programming” a few months ago. By “programming” I mean taking Moparscape servers and clients and modifying them to a great extent. I was able to make some good stuff on the private servers but then I decided that I wanted to make a game by myself (which was the whole reason I started Runescape Private Servers). Making games with C isn’t really that easy as some people would know. But it’s my strong suit… Java however is NOT. I bought a book a few days ago that helped me out with some stuff but the whole concept of a “game” doesnt really fit together in my head. Making simple little applets that do basic algebra and making little animations is about all I can do with Java so far… But even then it still doesn’t help out alot. So the game I want to make is an RPG game. I know that I have to have a Main.java file, and Player.java file… I know I have to run sprites and other stuff, I know about public voids and everything, I can paint graphics I can move an image with a mouse click… But putting it all together for some reason comes as a challenge to me. It’s like I’m making this too hard when in fact it’s probably easier than I thought. Anyway the question that I’m asking is what do I need to make first? And I have an idea on what I want to happen… here is my outline.</p>
<pre><code>    Game side                                                                                            Coding Side

-PetsHandler(?)<br>
-ProjectileHandler(?)<br>
-QuestHandler<br>

<p>So with these am I at least on the right track to making the style game that I want?<br>
Also, I need some help with making a client because I’m having trouble with the Appletveiwer that comes with the JDK… It wont run…<br>
So yeah… Can someone please help me out?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>

<p>(P.S. If you can help me wiith a client, will you PM me? Thank you)</p>

<p>Google is your solution. Object Orientation, Structure Design and Patience.</p>
<p>Oh, and Handler is a misused term by idiots on moparscape.</p>

        <p>Sorry, but you are way in over your head. I hate being a bit redundant, but I will repeat what others have already said in this topic.</p>
<p>Developing a game is a very complicated process. Games are the pinnacles of programming in general, in my opinion. They are very complex because they require precise structuring, design (graphical and organizational), plus pre-requisite knowledge in all the fields the game covers. Such fields could include networking, data transfer, security, rendering, physics, artificial intelligence, etc. Not all of those necessarily, or directly should, pertain to programming either. You cannot be a networking programmer just by knowing the syntaxes of the language, you need to know the theories and the ideas behind networking (pre-Network+, as a minimum) before even trying to achieve the title of basic network programmer. The many fields of a game are just the beginning.</p>
<p>Beside the fields that a game development project covers, one must also show leadership skills, or his team will fail. If that person does not have a team, then they are going to have extreme difficulties in developing a game. Why? Because your opinion shouldn’t count. What I mean by this, is, your opinion should only be used to generate other opinions from other people. Don’t use your opinion unless you have years to back it up, or unless your colleagues agree with it. Without this mutual bond between you and your compatriots will fail miserably due to the fact that everyone wants their own idea implemented.</p>
<p>Okay, now that I have bored you and hopefully made you realize the seriousness and complexity in making a game, you might be discouraged. Don’t be! Making a game isn’t impossible, it is just very difficult. You must be extremely devoted. You must learn all there is to know about game development. After this, you must recruit a team that fills in the gaps. You need your team to cover idealist, programming, designing, and media positions. Every game will use these four categories of positions. Now, after you are sure of your knowledge in your field, as well as your colleagues, you now start a battle plan. You need to first start off slowly. Make a small arcade game or two, just to gain the feel of game development. Slowly move onto higher-level games, and start adapting to other libraries and maybe third-party game engines.</p>
<p>This development process may take months, maybe even a year or two, but it is absolutely necessary. If you go into the fire unprepared, you are going to burn quickly. I have heard many, many people say they want to make an MMORPG, or just a type of MMO. I hear it all the time. If all these people succeeded, we would never have heard of WoW or RuneScape, because all the other people’s specifically unique ideas could have been compiled in to create some sort of ultimate MMO. To really succeed in this vicious market, even with an MMO, you must be prepared. Realize what I said above and take it into practice. After the months or years you have practiced, and you find yourself ready, then start on the MMO. You will find it much easier to develop and probably have a lot of fun doing it. I hope to see your game being talked about someday.</p>
