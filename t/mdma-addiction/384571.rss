    <title>MDMA Addiction?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mdma-addiction/384571</link>
    <description>Well as many of you know I&#39;m a fairly avid experimenter of different drugs mainly for educational purposes and curiosity.  My first experience with molly was about a year ago and since then I would probably say its grown from recreational use to abuse.  I&#39;m aware that MDMA as a single compound is not physically addictive however also understand that I&#39;ve never tested any of the powder that I get so I have no idea what kind of stimulants my powder was cut with.  Taking into consideration that the vast majority of substances used to cut MDMA are amphetamine or methamphetamine it would explain the addiction sensations I&#39;m currently having.  Please note that I have never purchased or taken ecstasy in a pressed pill or capsule form and have always purchased powder and parachuted it.

I will refer to a &quot;dose&quot; of MDMA being anywhere between 100mg and 300mg depending on the apparent &quot;potency&quot;.

Recently my MDMA use has gone from once every couple months, to once every couple weeks, to once every weekend and now my use is becoming apparent during the work week as well.  I dose without even thinking about it and afterwards I ask myself why I just did that but then it is too late.

I also wake up after a night of MDMA use and all I want is more, and I crave it.

I would rather not discontinue my use of MDMA however I do not want to let it get a hold of my life in a negative way which it seems it already has.  Any help or suggestions is very welcome.  I am mature enough to dump this stuff cold turkey if need be, but I have looking for any helpful insight from you guys.</description>

              <p>I would love to say to you, that if you just hammer it for the next while, you’ll just get bored of it in a few months.</p>
<p>But then I remember the many friends in highschool that went e-tard.</p>
<p>I know exactly what you mean by making this topic though. You want to quit, but really you don’t =/ Easiest way is to have the proper motivation to quit. Even though you feel its negative effects and spend money on it, and you’re unsure of your ability to quit, you still dont have that raw motivation to quit which makes it so much easier. That is why I said to hammer it until you get bored and the high sucks and the comedown even worse. But not everyone works the same, because a lot of people I know <em>didn’t</em> get bored.</p>
<p>If you can’t seem to get in the proper mind-state for quitting, then your only other option is to man up and take the initiative.</p>

However, if I purposely smoke myself to the point of being totally pooched, then it works as a good deterrent.  Makes me go through the herb pretty quick though and makes me pretty useless haha.</p>
<p>As for MDMA test kits, my current situation restricts me from purchasing them online and there is nowhere around me that sells them.</p>

<p>That’s fair enough and I don’t disagree with that, I was just pointing out that many people are addicted to things and it doesn’t always have a negative impact on their life. Coffee drinkers for instance.</p>
<p>I’m not disagreeing with anything that’s really being said in this thread, I just wanted it to be understood that addiction is more common than people would like to agree, and the vast majority of the population probably have a drug habit without even realising. As you said, in those moments when something does seem to be controlling your life, it’s probably time to take a break. However if you are a functional addict (especially if you are more functional with your addiction) then you should take time and decide what is best for you, not just do what society would tell you to do (which is almost always quit).</p>

              <p>Talking about addiction, I wouldn’t say I’m addicted to MDMA, as I don’t do it every single weekend, even if I do sell it. I normally do it every fortnight only if a big event is on, I never do it sitting around a house.</p>
<p>What I do have an addiction to though, is Ketamine, I find myself doing this every week, even through the weekdays and sometimes throughout the day whilst I am at uni/work. As it has already been stated as humans we have a nature to have addictions, certain foods and certain music for example. Just because it is a drug does not make it any different, times come and pass and there will come and point when you realise WTF and pack it in.</p>
<p>My advice is have fun whilst you are young, but don’t let the drug lifestyle run your life.</p>

              <p>I was never arguing that MDMA isn’t physically addictive, as I’ve never taken or researched it (in-depth). I’ve actually personally always thought it was, and that it was dangerous (or at least more dangerous than weed which is the only “drug” I use legal or illegal).</p>
<p>I just originally wanted to point out to MITB that addiction isn’t always a bad thing. I don’t drink alcohol or coffee. I know for a fact a lot of my friends and family are addicted to alcohol and coffee but they don’t even know it (and they’d never freely admit it, because they just don’t understand - it’s legal so it’s not addictive kind of mentality). Yet if you use either of these substances for any period of time you will get physical cravings for them in future. Caffeine is one of the most physically addictive substances, you experience negative withdrawal upon not getting your fix - I know lots of people who feel physically exhausted if they don’t get their morning coffee.</p>

              <p>Physical addiction is a state of dependence from constant daily use of a substance. Your body gets used to the working normally with the drug, and when you discontinue its use you feel negative withdrawal symptoms, directly caused by the lack of intake of that substance. Obvious examples include; caffeine, nicotine and alcohol. I could go more scientific, but I think I’ve explained sufficiently for you to understand what I mean here.</p>
<p>Psychological addiction is completely different and a much more ambiguous area to discuss as it varies with person to person. Gambling is not physically addictive, despite the fact you put no substance into your body people still get very addicted. It can be stopped without withdrawal symptoms (so there is no physical dependence/addiction).</p>
<p>Physical addiction is physical and psychological (because the physical withdrawal symptoms give you psychological cravings). Psychological addiction however can be completely in your own head without the need for any physical chemical to be entered into your body for it to start (I presume because you produce your own chemicals naturally doing something you enjoy).</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>What part of human nature is there that isn’t physical?</p>
<p>I got a little tangential, really my point was that it doesn’t <em>matter</em> whether its physical or mental.</p>
<p>But since you brought it up, how are they different? Do you believe in a soul? What component of “human nature” isn’t physical?</p>
<p>Also, people have a tendency to bring their own definitions of physical addiction to the table when it comes to things like this - and it’s completely impossible to separate different peoples definitions without getting into semantics.</p>
<p>For example, MDMA is not generally considered a physical addiction - yet it is documented (iirc) that habitual use downregulates 5HT-2 receptors (which is what Ollie meant by “drains serotonin” I think, despite them being different). If it downregulates <em>physical</em> receptors, and due to that you desire more/experience negative effects after stopping use, how is that not “physical”? Yet most people (experts included) don’t consider it so.</p>
<p>It’s such a mess to keep using the two terms when all we care about is behavior, imo.</p>

<p class="pubmed-abstract">
  The present study examined short- and long-term effects of MDMA (3,4-methylene-dioxymethamphetamine) on serotonin (5-HT2 and 5-HT1c) receptors in the brain of the rat. N1-Methyl-2-[125I]lysergic acid diethylamide ([125I]MIL) was used to label these receptors in vitro and in vivo. The usefulness of [125I]MIL for in vivo detection of changes in 5-HT2 receptors was confirmed in preliminary experiments in which rats were treated chronically with mianserin (5 mg/kg, once daily for 10 days). Decreases in specific in vivo binding of [125I]MIL, after treatment with mianserin were found to be of the same magnitude as those determined by others, using in vitro methods. The MDMA (8 doses; 5-20 mg/kg each) was administered to rats over a period of 4 days. At various times after administration of the last dose of MDMA, the binding of [125I]MIL was measured. Acutely, treatment with MDMA (20 mg/kg) reduced specific in vivo binding of [125I]MIL in all regions of brain studied. For example, in the frontal cortex, specific binding of [125I]MIL was decreased by 80% at 6 hr and by 62% at 24 hr, after cessation of treatment with MDMA. Twenty-one days after administration of MDMA however, the number of binding sites for [125I]MIL was back to control levels. Reductions in in vivo binding of [125I]MIL in frontal cortex were dependent on the dose of MDMA injected and were associated with decreases in the number of binding sites for [125I]MIL (Bmax values) in tissue homogenates of the same area. Autoradiographic studies of MDMA-treated rats confirmed the decreased density of 5-HT2 receptors and also suggested that the 5-HT1c receptor of the choroid plexus was not affected. These results indicate that repeated administration of MDMA caused transient down-regulation of 5-HT2 receptors in the brain of the rat. Further, they demonstrated that [125I]MIL is a suitable radioligand for labeling 5-HT2 receptors, both in vitro and in vivo. Once labeled with an appropriate radionuclide for SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) or PET (positron emission tomography), MIL should prove useful for monitoring changes in the density of serotonin receptors in the living mammalian brain.

<p>I disagree with your mental VS physical addiction. Psychological addiction definitely exists, since there is nothing physically addictive about gaming or gambling. It’s human nature, and some are more susceptible than others (obsessive compulsive disorder, is a prime example). Addiction also doesn’t need to be a bad thing, you can be responsible about addiction, most of the great, and obsessive scientists were probably addicted to their work.</p>

              <p>First, it’s a good idea to drop this idea of “mental” vs “physical” addiction. I think it does more harm than good to think of addiction in this way - after all, addiction is a behavior, it matters little what the cause of the behavior is - and that’s ignoring the fact that after all, at the end of the day, <em>everything</em> is physical… I think there’s a tendency for the layman to use “mental addiction” to mean “not a real addiction” to justify their own behavior.</p>
<p>Secondly, your experience is not unusual. I hear this shit all the time about MDMA not being addictive, and yet everyone who uses it regularly seems to have this period where they hammer it to negative effect - sounds addictive to me!</p>
<p>Take a break. MDMA will still be there when you get back (shit, if you’re finding good stuff now you’ll be able to find it anytime, the country is drier than a bone :/) and the longer it goes on the longer you’ll have the negative effects when parting from it.</p>
<p>I love MDMA, but it’s definitely a drug to keep to irregular use. I haven’t yet met a heavy habitual MDMA user who didn’t regret it a few years down the line, even Ollie will eventually I suspect. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>ps That article linked misrepresents Nutt, he has never said that MDMA is safe.</p>
