    <description>Hey guys, I need help on a client issue for my rsps. 

the problem: Whenever I hit complie.bat, my rsps client wont start. I need to hit compile because I need to have the cachedownloader.class. However, even without having cachedownloader.java, when I hit compile and then go to my rsps client it says : COULD NOT FIND OR LOAD MAIN CLASS: Gui 

Willing to accept help via teamviewer, please help!</description>
