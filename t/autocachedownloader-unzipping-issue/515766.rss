    <title>AutoCacheDownloader Unzipping Issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/autocachedownloader-unzipping-issue/515766</link>
    <description>So, I am making a custom webclient for my server. I am using DeathlyPvpz V4 as my source and client. I have renamed my cache folder in signlink.java, and changed the download link in cachedownloader.java. I have also compressed my cache in a .zip file and uploaded it to Dropbox. However, when I try to run my client, it downloads all of the cache, then gives me this error. If this helps at all, this is my Cachedownloader.java - http://pastebin.com/v9y62i9Q and this is my Signlink.java - http://pastebin.com/knmdzmZi

And this is what it actually downloaded.

Edit: If I extract CridCacheV1 manually (shown in the second picture), the client works fine.

So apparently it&#39;s not extracting the cache correctly? If anyone knows how to fix this, any help would be much appreciated. Thanks so much!</description>
