    <title>It Says My Server Is Offline When I&#39;m Trying To Make a Webclient at rs-ps,org</title>

    <description>Hi,

I Have tried making a webclient for my server at rs-ps,org

I have been attempting this, for at least 2 hours now,but still no luck.

i run the server and it seems to be on, but whenever i go to make the webclient, it comes up with an error message saying: &quot;* Your server is currently offline, please make sure your server is online before you try to create a webclient.&quot;



I Was wondering if anyone knows what to do and how i can fix this :)

Thanks,
Greenie</description>

              <p>Did you even portforward it? It’s probably working for you because your using the local host: 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0.<br>
Go to <a href="http://canyouseeme.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://canyouseeme.org/</a> and if it says Cannot find you, that means you didn’t portforward correctly.</p>
<p>For the portforwarding guide go to the tutorials section in RS2 server emulation board.</p>
