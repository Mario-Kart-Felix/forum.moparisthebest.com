    <title>[vb]Two diff forms interacting with eachother?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vb-two-diff-forms-interacting-with-eachother/3616</link>
    <description>This is my noobie question of the week:

I am making an rpg game for Computer Science, and we need to have a item inventory. I could easily do this in a single form but it needs to be a seperate form. All I need to know is, how can I make the two forms interact? Lets say you picked up an item, how would you make the item go into another form? 

Thanks...</description>

              <p>Freddy, if by some chance blitzmax’s 3d module comes out soon then you can use that cuz it’ll be using all latest technology(sorta) with directx9. It’s a very neat programming language but I never bought the compiler for it yet. Or you can even use opengl with it.</p>

              <p>Yes, it is a BASIC language, I heard most similar to qbasic, with a few twists of C.</p>
<p>It’s just so damn easy to make a simple game with it though. You can make a simple 3d game without even having 3d models too, thats one of the things I love about it(it’s great for making puzzle games). And it is very limited, but half the fun I find in it is going past it’s limitations(Directx7 is extremely limited if you haven’t noticed).</p>
<p>And when I said completly different then VB, I meant making a game-wise. You can make better and quicker games, 5 times easier.</p>

<p>It’s designed purely for games, so… Yeah <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> And like everything you need has a simple code to it.</p>
<p>It’s just that I just started VB, our teacher never gae us any help at all, so it makes it diffacult. We have a text book, but the most advanced thing in it is making a calculator, which took like 5 minutes from my own knowledge.</p>
<p>PS, The game is due on friday. I’m almost done. Just getting sprites to work better, and then adding in random battles(the current system I have so retarded. You automatically fight every minute) It’s pretty lame, all I ahve so far is a flash movie intro, that shows you as a thief sneaking into a palace to steal the trasure. The first roo you sneak by guards, if they see you then you die <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Next room has random arrows shooting out from the walls, you just dodge them, kinda like frogger, then you end up in a basement, then that leads to a cave full of monsters, which then leads you to a boss, which then leads you to another room with the treasure and a ladder that brings you back up to the surface, lol. And thats all <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Quite often I can do semi-advanced stuff, while I cant do crappy lil things. For example, I am grade 10, going into 11, and I still dont understand Long Division, rofl. Calculator ftw!</p>

You don’t have to make them “interact” all you have to do is add form1. to the start of whatever.</p>
<p>Eg, read text from an edit box in one form you do</p>
<p>theVar := form1.edit1.text;</p>
<p>or maybe you want something like this:</p>
<p>form2.item1.text := form1.newItem.text;</p>
<p>You’l have to work out how your handeling all your items and stuff which i doubt you’l know how to do if you didn’t know how to do this form thing.</p>
