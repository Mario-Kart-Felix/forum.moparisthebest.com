    <title>I7-4770(+K) 4th Generation Review</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i7-4770-k-4th-generation-review/520798</link>
    <description>I have been reading up on the new 4th generation of the intel chip and wanted to make a review on it. Many pc upgraders were expecting a &quot;drastic and amazing change&quot; in performance with the new 4th generation however I believe for the most part it has been a disappointment. I have listed below the pros/cons of the new chip(s).

Pros:
-Have added additional support to balance out with AMD for calculations of one cycle
-Throughput has doubled
-Intel &quot;claims&quot; that the chip runs 15-20% faster.
Cons:
-requires more voltage - hence more heat
-the performance increase isn&#39;t that great for the price difference.
-what I would call &quot;failed overclocking update&quot; maybe some of you pc guys can be more specific or give a better term.</description>

I will have you know I took a good two hours or so actually reading up on the product to give the pros/cons and to make sure this was an accurate review. Please don’t make accusations such as this.</p>

              <p>It’s basically the same price as its Ivy Bridge counterparts. It’s a lot more stable when it gets hot, making overclocking safer. If you have an Ivy Bridge or even Sandy Bridge processor there’s probably no rush to get it, but this is going to see quite a performance increase in ultrabooks and tablets. The problem is Intel have a monopoly in the market, so there’s no competition to push performance up. Hopefully Steamroller puts AMD a fair bit closer to Intel in terms of speed.</p>
