    <title>A bit lag</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-bit-lag/384998</link>
    <description>Hey guys I&#39;m testing this new server and there&#39;s something in it that&#39;s driving me crazy you all are probably familiar with this.
When you turn with the left arrow or right arrow after a little while you get this tiny tiny lag and it happens to everything you do like walk after a little while of walking you get it.
Think of it as this:
Your spinning a piece of paper on a table and its spinning fast now imagine your touching it for less than a second. Well I think it has something to do with the packets I&#39;m not an expert but that&#39;s the closest thing I came up with. Source is project insanity based</description>

              <p>lol, not sure but its probably unstable as well so you should switch to another source and don’t whatever you do don’t use eudora-world i had it up 2 weeks no lag but it broke literally no one hacked me either i know the difference it literally broke because its not a stable source… now it disconnects people and i have to restart server…</p>
