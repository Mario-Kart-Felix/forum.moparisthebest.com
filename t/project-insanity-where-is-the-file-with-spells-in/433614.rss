    <title>[Project Insanity] Where is the file with spells in</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-insanity-where-is-the-file-with-spells-in/433614</link>
    <description>I want to change the damage all spells do and see what their gfx and anims are. What is the file called which these codes are in?

I am using Project Insanity base. Please it isn&#39;t much to ask but i&#39;m also not very good at finding things. Thanks</description>
