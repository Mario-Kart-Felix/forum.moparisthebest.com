    <description>Hi, we currently need about 2 hosters to host the famous &quot;Earthscape&quot;.
Needs to have a quite fast computer and a person who knows what they are doing,
We need 1 hoster that can use no-ip, and 1 hoster with hamachi.
Server is testscape based.

The server includes
Full membership is working , all skills working , no glitches on armor , pvp emote to allow ppl pking everywhere , flying skill , many mini games , modcity and MUCH MUCH MORE!

The hoster/hosters will recive admin on the server.
