    <title>Resizing Mapback</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/resizing-mapback/302841</link>
    <description>Hello Reader,

I been trying to resize my mapback, but I have had no luck with it at the moment.

This is the problem that occurs when I try resizing..

I want it to completely fill above the inventory + I will remove the unnecessary stuff later.
Can anyone help me with the stretching, or how I can manage to fix it?</description>
