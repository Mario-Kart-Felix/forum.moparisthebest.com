    <title>Files Cfg not found when running server. How to fix that?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/files-cfg-not-found-when-running-server-how-to-fix-that/293852</link>
    <description>I am trying to run my server based of DeltaScape on my iTouch and it works but when I run it, it says: Autospawn.cfg file not found, shops.cfg not found and like three other one. But the problem is that I got all my .cfg file in &quot;config&quot;. The file cfg are not saying file not found on my computer. I even tried to put all my config files into my other files and it didnt worked. Can you help me fix that please ? Because I can&#39;t see npc or shops if it doesnt work.

Thanks.</description>
