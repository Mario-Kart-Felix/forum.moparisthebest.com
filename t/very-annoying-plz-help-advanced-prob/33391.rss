    <description>[b]quick problem:[/b] I need to know what interface to send 53 to show items on interface 8714.  

[b]Server Base:[/b]  does this matter for this problem?  Highly modified hybridscape 

[b]Rating:[/b]  8 (unless you already figured it out then 1)

[b]Explained Problem:[/b]  I have been trying all day to figure out the interface for the item images on the skill menu 8714.  I have also searched all over, and i haven&#39;t even found a server with it, or anything.  I&#39;ve found lots of servers using 8714 interface, but no pictures yet.  I&#39;ve tried sendFrame246 every interface number there is, and sendFrame126 on every interface there is, and i&#39;ve narrowed it down a lot.  I&#39;m thinking that i&#39;m to use outStream.createFrameVarSizeWord(53) like on resetitems() sending it to the correct interface, to list the items on the skill menu.  I know it&#39;s in an up and down line, not rows of items like a bank or trade window.  but I think this is the way, because there isn&#39;t many interfaces left over to put 40 pictures.  there are 40 interface lines for level and 40 for the text.  I know this is a lot of explanation, but it to me is advanced problem, so i thought i would try to make it understandable.  If this isn&#39;t even the right way, tell me and i can stop trying one interface at a time.  It sux that the client has and error each time i try the wrong one. 

I&#39;m using this to test it:

[code]
outStream.createFrameVarSizeWord(53); //item frame 
outStream.writeWord(8826); //interface - I&#39;ve went from 8714-8826 so far
outStream.writeWord(1); //how many items
outStream.writeByte(1); //amount of item
outStream.writeWordBigEndianA(1205); //item id - bronze dagger
outStream.endFrameVarSizeWord(); //end frame
[/code]

I&#39;ve been working on filling out the lines of the text for now.[br][size=1]Posted at: December 08, 2006, 08:42:53 PM[/size][hr]i have another part to this problem here:

              <p>so what ur trying to say is u don’t think the client has the interface for these pictures?  from what i’m guessing it works just like showing items in bank, inventory, trade window, duel stake, etc.  i just need to find the correct interface to send the items to.[br][size=1]Posted at: December 09, 2006, 01:38:54 PM[/size][hr]anyone else<br>
[br][size=1]Posted at: December 10, 2006, 10:38:40 AM[/size][hr]ok i’ve been trying more and i found a couple other frames, that might be for items also, going to try them, but too tired tonight.  i still think it’s going to be frame 53… but haven’t got that to work yet.</p>

<p>Well I am not sure if any of the pictures are considered interfaces or frams in the cache. You would probably have to manually load the images onto the Server, set them equal to a sendFrame, and then you would have to make the frame send on the interface with the correct cords. It is A LOT easier to do in normal Java, but this game is very confusing lolz (but I am learning <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  .)</p>

</aside>
<p>i read this again and from what i gather, is that the client should already have an interface and a frame for this (which i don’t know).  if you look at how you work frame 53 u have to send an interface id, an item id, item amount, etc.  53 is used for all the interfaces i mentioned before.  there are item numbers for the pictures of the skill help menu, that’s how i know it is sent as an item ID.  for example the crawling hand item for slayer.</p>
<p>is there anyone who knows clients enough to maybe point me in right direction to figure out what frame/interface this might be?</p>
