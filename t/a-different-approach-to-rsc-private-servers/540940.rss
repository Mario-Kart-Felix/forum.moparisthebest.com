    <title>A different approach to RSC private servers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-different-approach-to-rsc-private-servers/540940</link>
    <description>I got inspired by Shinrael&#39;s journey in RSCR (http://www.rscrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?id=12001).

Almost in every RSC private server there is a problem with excessive amounts of money. People think of ways how to remove money from the system, gambling, teleporting for money etc. 
Instead of dealing with consequences we should, in my opinion, solve the problem that leads to that. Most of RSC private server players have played the game before RS2 was out. So they have a lot of experience in this game. I am sure that most of us know the RSC map by heart, even the spawns of items. We know how to make money quickly. When rares come out people don&#39;t sell them for 10k gp or just drop them because they have already so many of them. I think it is safe to say that most of us have mastered the game? 
When ProjectRSC came out the Team Catman appeared. They reached all the smithing levels first and had enormous amounts of money/resources. They were basically dictating the game. I would say they did what they wanted with the economy.
What if there were no skilling teams? What if everyone was out for their own?

[b]What if there was a server where trading was not allowed?[/b]
This would add some oldschool feeling to the server, people would not rush for 40 1 x. Instead, there would be accounts with stats 30 20 x etc. Same goes with 99 99 99, you cannot sit anymore in wild afking since you have to make your own items aswell. Multilogging wouldn&#39;t have much of use anymore.

[b]That would kill off pking since people would have to spend their time on skilling[/b]
In addition to ordinary wilderness there would pvp zone (+-5 levels) everywhere except lumbridge and banks.
About Lumbridge:
In North the PVP zone would begin behind the gates near chicken farm and near the T crossing north east of that.
In East the PVP zone would begin behind the gate to alkharid.
In South, well there is fence already everywhere.
In West near chicken farm and behind the general store.

[b]That would be too hard, there would be no possibility to even get the things going.[/b]
We would add a bank to lumbridge castle;
a mine near the goblin house with copper, tin and iron;
a fishing spot on the river for trouts, salmons, shrimps and anchovies.
This way there would be a possibility to start off at a safe zone. 
In addition, the RSC community is quite small. Mostly when a new player starts in a server he sees noone and is likely to close the client. Lumbridge is rather small town, a new player would definitely see others fishing or mining near the goblin hut so he wouldn&#39;t feel alone.

[b]P2P or F2P?[/b]
The game would be F2P. As I already mentioned, the RSC community is rather small. Having it only F2P will make the game more compact.

[b]But people will start killing the miners and fishers[/b]
Well that is the idea of everyone being out for their own. You have to defend your spot, create a defensive alliance or skill in lumbridge. This will also make botting pointless since you can get killed basically everywhere.

Of course dropping items worth more than 20 gp would be not allowed. Stackable items would be impossible to drop or when you die they would stay in your inventory. Just to avoid drop trading.



So, what are your thoughts? Could something like this work out? I am not experienced enough in coding and could not pull off on my own, but if any coder is interested in a project like this then I am glad to contribute in brainstorming and putting the structure together.</description>

<p>This looks like a pretty darn fun idea. Been playing quite a bit of DayZ and it is a massive survival zombie game. You can drop items on the ground to give them away but there are no duel or trade dialogs with other players. You run around and scavenge for cans of beans and then must either kill or be killed for other player’s cans of beans. Could be something that could be done in RSC - large forest areas, ruined towns, item spawns, hunger/thirst, zombie npc spawns, PVP everywhere. Been itching to get back into java programming.</p>

<p>F2P only ? = I’d say there will be only a few things to do then u will lose interest in playing … ( ex : smithing, crafting, fish, cook … But no Herblaw,agility,fletching … skills which keep you busy for a longer time) so i’d say P2P and yeh u can make dragon items smithable too and add new amulets on crafting, dragon arrows on fletching and more nice things.</p>
<p>Wildy all around except banks = A great idea but you should make a dungeon or a small safe zone for training (low lvl mobs and only a few mobs).</p>
<p>But there will be a main problem. As i know RSC pking community … there will be like 20 pkers in a team vs 5 ! (LIKE ALWAYS)</p>
<p>Anyway i will support your idea and GOOD LUCK ! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
