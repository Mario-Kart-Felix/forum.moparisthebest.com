<p>What you can do is make a level 3 named anything, spawn swordfish in their bank using the control panel. Go to the players folder, go to their template, copy everything in it. Go to the file called ‘template’ and delete everything and paste everything you just copied. Make sure the rank=0 and make sure the pass=NULL. This will copy everything you add into their banks, stats you put on that account, inventory, and location.</p>
