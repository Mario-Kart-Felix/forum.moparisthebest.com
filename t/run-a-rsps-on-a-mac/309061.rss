    <description>[size=18pt][b]iServer: Run a RSPS on a Mac[/b][/size]

***I am working on the side with OSX Leopard, but it should work similarly***

[b]Part 1: Getting the &quot;paint for the painting&quot;[/b]

What good is the Mona Lisa without the paint for it to actually be the Mona Lisa? Well, there are a few things you&#39;re going to need before we run the server!

[b]Java Runtime Environment[/b] - This is a must for any Java work! https://cds.sun.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/CDS-CDS_Developer-Site/en_US/-/USD/ViewProductDetail-Start?ProductRef=jre-6u16-oth-JPR@CDS-CDS_Developer
[b]
JDK 1.6 or higher[/b] - https://cds.sun.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/CDS-CDS_Developer-Site/en_US/-/USD/ViewProductDetail-Start?ProductRef=jdk-6u16-oth-JPR@CDS-CDS_Developer
[b]
A Server Source [/b]- Here&#39;s one of my old ones http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,403258.0.html
[b]
A Client [/b]- This is the ONLY client for Mac, it is 508 http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,402045.0.html

[b]Part 2: Let the &quot;fun&quot; Begin[/b]

What you&#39;re going to do now is unzip/unrar our server source, as well as the client you downloaded, unless you&#39;re playing the Silabsoft webclient.

You will use the Java compiler [b]javac [/b]to compile your Java programs and the Java interpreter java to run them. To check if Apple&#39;s implementation of Java 2 Standard Edition (Java SE 6) is already installed:

    * Run Software Update.

    * Run Applications/Utilities/Java/Java Preferences and verify that the Java Applications version is set to Java SE 6. 


[b]Command-line interface:[/b]

You will type commands in an application called the [b]Terminal[/b].

    * Open a terminal window. You can find this under Go -&gt; Applications -&gt; Utilities. Drag the Terminal to your dock since you will be using it frequently.

    * You should now have a Terminal window somewhere on the screen. It will have a prompt that looks something like:
[code]
          machine:~ user$[/code]

    * To check that you are running the right version of Java, type the commands in boldface below. You should see something similar to the information printed below. The important part is that it says 1.6 or 1.5 (and not 1.4).
[code]
          machine:~ user$ java -version
          java version &quot;1.6.0_15&quot;
          Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_15-b03-226)
          Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 14.1-b02-92, mixed mode)[/code]

      Then type

[code]          machine:~ user$ javac -version
          javac 1.6.0_15[/code]

    * Since you will be using the Terminal frequently, you may want to customize the default window settings (e.g., Monaco 13pt font with antialiasing). 

[b]
Compile the program:[/b]

You will use the [b]javac [/b]command to convert your Java program into a form more amenable for execution on a computer.

    * From the Terminal, navigate to the directory containing your .java files, say ~user/508source/bin, by typing the cd command below.

[code]          machine:~ user$ cd 508source/bin
          machine:~/508source/bin wayne$[/code]

    * Assuming the files are all in the current working directory, type the [b]javac [/b]command below to compile it.

[code]          machine:~508source/bin user$ javac *.java
          machine:~508source/bin user$[/code]

      If everything went well, you should see no error messages. 

[b]
Run the Server:[/b]

You will use the java command to run your server.

    * From the Terminal, type the java command below.

[code]          machine:~/508source/bin user$ java *.class
          Starting up 508Server on port 43594...[/code]

      If all goes well, you should see the output in the Terminal stating that the server is running. Feel free to alter the code above, I&#39;m working from my brain on this part because my Mac is updating around 50 programs.  :eek:

[b]
Part 3: Troubleshooting[/b]

[b]Input and Output[/b]

If your program gets stuck in an infinite loop, type Ctrl-c to break out.

If you are entering input from the keyboard, you can signify to your program that there is no more data by typing Ctrl-d for EOF (end of file). You should type this character on its own line. 


Good Luck!
