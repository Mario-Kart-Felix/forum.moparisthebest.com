    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/heroicscape/515838</link>
    <description>Atm heroicscape is just opend
its about 3 days old.
i already coded a lot in it to try and make it unique
- I already added dungeoneering, it works 100% (btw its my own way of dungeoneering so its not like the realy rs or any other private server)
- Lots of Nice grafix ect.
- I changed godwars to the old 1 because i like it more
- Summoning is working 95% (u gotta use the items on the puches)
- Its still little, and there are some staff spots open. (but i don&#39;t make u staff member if u ask me, u gotta diserf it)
- I&#39;m working on Nex and the rest of the bosses now, soon they will be added
- spirit beast and torment demons are added.
- the server has a great and perfect new home. not like the boring Edgvill
- I changed the donator items, so ure able to wear ALL items if ure not a donator, i didn&#39;t make this server to make money. i made this server for other people to have fun (i might ask for donations, just because i gotta buy a vps ect.)
- herbloreing skill is diff from other server.
- money pouch added and working.
- u see the exp u gain ea npc u kill or skill u train.
- i added a vote shop, donator shop, level shop, pk shop
Forums located at : http://heroicscape.top-talk.com/

<p>Uhm… Making a webclient is free. You can also use a free web host to start off as well so you can host an actual site.</p>
