    <title>Character look rep ++</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/character-look-rep/425845</link>
    <description>This is when you first start off and make an account, it automatically sets your character to this look if you don&#39;t change it on the interface. How do I change it?

I thought this was it in player.java
[code]// Setting player standard look
		playerLook[0] = 19;
		playerLook[1] = 19;
		playerLook[2] = 19;
		playerLook[3] = 19;
		playerLook[4] = 19;
		playerLook[5] = 19;[/code]

But it wasn&#39;t. I tried changing all the values and still no luck.</description>

<p>What you’re seeing in the server is the default look (a cheap hack really). However, there is no “Default” look in the vanilla. The player is merely “invisible”, and when the server receives packet 101, the player’s appearance is set.</p>

<p>Thank you. I have to get off for now but if you could pm me, I would be very happy. This is very irritating. I’ve tried loading different sources through my same client also, and it has a different look so it can’t be client sided.[/quote]mmk thanks for that info now I won’t take hours pulling out my hair <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> I’ll find it lol</p>
