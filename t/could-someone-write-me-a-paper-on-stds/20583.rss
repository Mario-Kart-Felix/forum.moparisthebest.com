    <description>Could someone write me a paper on STDs?

All I need to do is get information on STDs like...

- How can you get them?
- What can you do to prevent?
- What are all the STDs?
- Random statistics.

and a bibliography.

Anyone want to spare me the 30 min and do this for me? :D

          <blockquote>
              <p>An essay on STDS</p>
<p>The subject of STDS is a controversial issue. The constantly changing fashionable take on STDS demonstrates the depth of the subject. Cited by many as the single most important influence on post modern micro eco compartmentalism, spasmodically it returns to create a new passion amongst those who study its history. Often it is seen as both a help and a hinderence to socialists, who are likely to form a major stronghold in the inevitable battle for hearts and minds. Complex though it is I shall now attempt to provide an exaustive report on STDS and its numerous ‘industries’.</p>
<p>Social Factors</p>
<p>Society begins and ends with STDS. When blues legend ‘Bare Foot D’ remarked ‘awooooh eeee only my dawg understands me’ [1] he failed to understand that if one seriously intends to ‘not judge a book by its cover’, then one must read a lot of books. A society without STDS is like a society without knowledge, in that it bravely illustrates what we are most afraid of, what we all know deep down in our hearts.</p>
<p>Some analysts have been tempted to disregard STDS. I haven�t. It is intrinsically linked to adolescent inner acclimatisation.</p>
<p>Economic Factors</p>
<p>The dictionary defines economics as ‘the social science concerned with the production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of goods and services’. We shall examine the Watkis-Teeth-Pulling model. For those of you unfamiliar with this model it is derived from the Three-Amigos model but with greater emphasis on the outlying gross national product.<br>
Inflation</p>
<pre><code>	STDS
</code></pre>
<p>There are a number of reasons which may be attributed to this unquestionable correlation. It goes with out saying that inflation world wide are driven entirely by STDS. The economic policy spectrum is seeing a period of unprecedented growth.</p>
<p>Political Factors</p>
<p>No man is an island, but what of politics? Looking at the spectrum represented by a single political party can be reminiscent of comparing STDS and ones own image of themselves.</p>
<p>Take a moment to consider the words of nobel prize winner Kuuipo Skank ‘political change changes politics, but where does it go?’ [2] I argue that his insight into STDS provided the inspiration for these great words. History tells us that STDS will always be a vote winner, whether we like it, or not.<br>
One of the great ironies of this age is STDS. Isn’t it ironic, don’t you think?</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>To reiterate, STDS plays a large part in the lives of all. It establishes order, it stimulates and it brings the best out in people.</p>
<p>One final thought from the talented Elton Poppins: ‘At first I was afraid I was petrified. Thinking I could never live without STDS by my side.’ [3]</p>

              <p><span class="bbcode-b">How</span><br>
A sexually transmitted disease (STD) is a disease caused by a pathogen (e.g., virus, bacterium, parasite, fungus) that is spread from person to person primarily through sexual contact. STDs can be painful, irritating, debilitating, and life threatening. More than twenty sexually transmitted diseases have been identified.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Statistics</span><br>
STDs occur most commonly in sexually active teenagers and young adults, especially those with multiple sex partners. An estimated 200 to 400 million people worldwide are infected—representing men and women of all economic classes.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in the United States more than 13 million people are infected each year and more than 65 million have an incurable STD. Generally, STD incidence has declined in the United States over the past 15 years, although rates among certain populations, including men who have sex with men, have increased.</p>
<p>Prevalance of Sexually Transmitted Diseases: 65 million people living with an incurable STD (CDC)<br>
Prevalance Rate: approx 1 in 4 or 23.90% or 65 million people in USA [about data]<br>
Incidence (annual) of Sexually Transmitted Diseases: 15.3 million annual cases (NIAID)<br>
Incidence Rate: approx 1 in 17 or 5.62% or 15.3 million people in USA [about data]<br>
Incidence extrapolations for USA for Sexually Transmitted Diseases: 15,300,000 per year, 1,275,000 per month, 294,230 per week, 41,917 per day, 1,746 per hour, 29 per minute, 0 per second.</p>
<p>Worldwide, an estimated 333 million new cases of four curable STDs (gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, syphilis and trichomoniasis) occurred in 1997.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Prevention</span><br>
The only sure way to avoid becoming infected with an STD is monogamy with an uninfected partner. It is important for partners to discuss their sexual and STD history before having sex and to consider getting tested. Prevention is possible only if sexually active individuals understand STDs and how they are spread.</p>
<p>The risk for transmission is dramatically reduced with the use of condoms and other safer sex practices. The following behaviors and conditions can increase the risk for STDs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engaging in sexual activity when either partner has unhealed lesions (e.g., genital herpes sores, genital warts)</li>
<li>Enema or rectal douching before rectal intercourse</li>
<li>Rectal or vaginal irritation or infection</li>
<li>Sexual activity that may damage the mucosal lining of the vagina or rectum</li>
<li>Tampon use (Tampons can cause vaginal dryness and cellular abnormalities. Sanitary  napkins, either disposable or washable cotton pads, are recommended.)</li>
<li>Vaginal dryness (Water-based lubricant is recommended.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoiding sexual contact with others is the best method for preventing the spread of STDs. For those who are sexually active, methods that can deter the spread of such diseases include:</p>
<ul>
<li>have a mutually monogamous sexual relationship with an uninfected partner</li>
<li>use a male condom</li>
<li>use clean needles if injecting intravenous drugs</li>
<li>decrease susceptibility to HIV infections by preventing and controlling other STDs</li>
<li>delay having sexual relationships as long as possible</li>
<li>have regular checkups for STDs</li>
<li>learn the symptoms of STDs and seek medical help as soon as possible if notice any symptoms</li>
<li>avoid having sexual intercourse during menstruation</li>
<li>avoid anal intercourse, or use a male condom</li>
<li>avoid douching</li>
</ul>
<p>Prevention information for Sexually Transmitted Diseases has been compiled from various data sources and may be inaccurate or incomplete. None of these methods guarantee prevention of Sexually Transmitted Diseases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Condoms - reduces the risk of transmission but does not exclude risk. Also</li>
<li>Some types of STDs are spread by means other than penetration</li>
<li>Avoid unsafe sex</li>
<li>Monogamy</li>
<li>Avoid sharing needles</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Common STDs</span><br>
Chlamydia. An infection of the genital area, spread through unprotected vaginal, oral or anal sex.</p>
<p>Trichomoniasis. An infection of the genital area, spread through unprotected vaginal sex.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea. An infection of the genital area, spread through unprotected vaginal, oral or anal sex.</p>
<p>Human Papillomavirus (HPV). An infection with more than 100 different types, primarily affecting the genital area, both the outer and inner surfaces. Spread through unprotected vaginal or anal intercourse, or by skin-to-skin contact with the affected area.</p>
<p>Genital Herpes. An infection of the genital area (and sometimes around the mouth). Spread through unprotected vaginal, oral or anal sex, or by skin-to-skin contact with an infected area.</p>
<p>Syphilis. An infection that starts in the genital area and then spreads throughout the body. The infection is spread through unprotected vaginal, oral or anal sex - and through kissing, if there is a lesion on the mouth.</p>
<p>Hepatitis B Virus (HBV). An infection primarily affecting the liver. Spread through unprotected vaginal, oral, and anal sex, through kissing, and by sharing contaminated needles.</p>
<p>HIV. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of AIDS. Spread through bodily fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal fluids and breast milk - in other words, during unprotected vaginal, oral or anal sex, by sharing contaminated needles, via pregnancy or breast-feeding.</p>

<p>All I need to do is get information on STDs like…</p>
<ul>
<li>How can you get them?</li>
<li>What can you do to prevent?</li>
<li>What are all the STDs?</li>
<li>Random statistics.</li>
</ul>
<p>and a bibliography.</p>
