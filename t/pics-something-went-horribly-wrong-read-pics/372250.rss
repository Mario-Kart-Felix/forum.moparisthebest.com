    <description>Hello everyone, im having a horrible problem, I was running my server and it was going great then the other night my internet decided to crash and didnt work for like a half hour. Finally it started working and the server was running all night. The next morning I log on and no one is on, my friend texts me and says hey why is the server down.. im like it is.? So we teamview and it shows he cant connect aswell as everyone else. I checked my router settings, my computer Ip is still the same, no-ip is all right, but no one can connect? Can someone please help me on what the problem is? I completly factory reset my router, and re-port-fowarded and still nothing is fixed!! =( and No-ip doesent seem to update the Ip on the deskop even when I refresh, Please Help fast!!
