    <description>okay i recently downloaded and have been recoding berky-scape to be a pking server, and i have spent alot of time coding it and just when i thought i was done i was walking around and tried to use a dark bow and all it did was walk up to the npc and start punching it with the dark bow wielded... and i tried to use a magic shortbow to range and it would attack as a regular bow but right after it hit the npc my client crashes. Does this mean i need a new client? or just to like recode the bow somehow?

and if someone could point me in the direction of a tutorial to fix the dark bow i would appreciate it, thanks..[br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 08, 2009, 04:52:44 pm[/size][hr]wtf someone please help???</description>

              <p>the dark bow won’t work because you need your server doesn’t recognise it. You will need to add it in with code (i dont know code or where to put it sorry). ;D</p>
