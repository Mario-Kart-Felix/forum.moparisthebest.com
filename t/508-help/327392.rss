    <description>Hi, this is a pretty easy Question to Answer, but, i&#39;m having trouble with some of my integers (ints). Take a look below:

I have this code, in my Engine Class:

[b]Public int BackupTimer = -1;[/b]

Then I have this code, in the Login Class:

[b]Engine.BackupTimer = 240;[/b]

And again, I have this code in my Engine Class:

[b]If (BackupTimer &gt; 0) {
BackupTimer--;[/b]

What the code is suppose to do is take 1 away from the timer, every second (Or for milleseconds, it will take 2 away every second). [b]Example:[/b] If I set the timer for 30 seconds, the code will pretty much make it into a timer like system, causing the 30 seconds to deduct slowly until reached 1. Ex: 30, 29, 28, 27, until it reaches 1, thus making a timer.

However, it just stays to the Paramitive Value, which is 240, the timer doesn&#39;t start, even though I program it to otherwise.

Help?</description>
