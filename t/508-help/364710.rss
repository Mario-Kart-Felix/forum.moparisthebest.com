    <title>[508] help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-help/364710</link>
    <description>Hi, I need help coding a few things in my 508, and here is the list.
1. Making dharoks hit high with low hp.
2. Making you lose items when you die.
3. Making it so that the person who does the most damage to a npc gets the drop. Right now everyone can see the drop and everyone can pick the drop up.
4. Fixing Duel arena, you can only attack with mage, and I want to be able to use melee too (same with fightpits)

If you can help me with ANY of those things I will be grateful. I&#39;m using a davidscape source too.</description>
