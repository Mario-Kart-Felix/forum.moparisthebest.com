    <description>I have the dummies in Varrock give you experience when you click on them, but i want them to stop giving exp at level 7, and I don&#39;t know how to do this. I also want them to train Defence and Strength to level 7 without getting one of the other two skills above 7. I also want the doors to open, so that you don&#39;t teleport through them</description>
