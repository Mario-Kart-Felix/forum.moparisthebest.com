    <description>Hi guys i am running a 508 with a 525 cache or as many of you people know it as a 517. My problem is that my server was built in with when you drop an item it deleteds outa the inventory but it dosn&#39;t show up on the ground. The source I am using is Final pvp. Can anyone tell me a solution on how I can make the item show up on the ground. Thank you.</description>
