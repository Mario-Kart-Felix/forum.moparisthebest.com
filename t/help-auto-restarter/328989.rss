    <title>Help... Auto restarter</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-auto-restarter/328989</link>
    <description>Well I just bought a dedicated host after my vps&#39;s failed horribly.

It has been going fine for the past two to three days, but recently on my auto restarter which is every 45 minutes, when it restarts it says &quot;Server already in use&quot;. Can someone please help?

Thanks.</description>
