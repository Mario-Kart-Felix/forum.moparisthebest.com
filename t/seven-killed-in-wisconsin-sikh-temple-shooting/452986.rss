    <description>Another one of these &quot;GIVE MORE GUNS TO PEOPLE!&quot; huh?

&lt;blockquote&gt;Greenfield Police Chief Bradley Wentlandt: &quot;We don&#39;t know if there are additional shooters inside the temple&quot;

At least seven people, including a gunman, have died in a shooting at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek in the US state of Wisconsin, police say.

The attacker &quot;ambushed&quot; a policeman at the scene, shooting him multiple times, before a second officer returned fire, killing the gunman, said authorities.

The shot officer was among three people injured in the attack.

Police say it does not appear that there was more than one shooter, as witnesses initially thought.

Tactical police teams have cleared the building.
&#39;Terrorist-type incident&#39;

President Barack Obama spoke of his sadness at the shooting, as he did after the gun massacre that left 12 dead at a Colorado cinema just over two weeks ago.

At a press conference, Oak Creek Police Chief John Edwards said they were treating the attack as a &quot;domestic terrorist-type incident&quot;, and that the FBI would take over the criminal investigation.

At least two reports earlier from inside the temple, or gurdwara, suggested the perpetrator was a white male.

The authorities said calls had been made to the emergency services at about 10:25 local time (15:25 GMT).

Four people were dead inside the temple and three outside - including the gunman, said the authorities.

&quot;The best information is that there was only one gunman,&quot; said Chief Edwards.

At least three critically wounded men were being treated at Milwaukee&#39;s Froedtert Hospital, said officials at that facility.

They included the police officer who had been shot multiple times, although he was expected to survive, said Chief Edwards.
&#39;Hiding in closets&#39;

Oak Creek is a town of about 30,000 people in the south-east corner of the state.

The website for the temple says it opened in 1999 and now has a congregation of 350-400. Sunday morning was the busiest time of worship, members of the congregation said.

Sukhwindar Nagr told the Associated Press news agency he had called his brother-in-law&#39;s phone. A priest at the temple answered and told him that his brother-in-law had been shot, along with three priests.

The priest also said women and children had been hiding in closets in the temple, Mr Nagr added.

Suni Singh told Newsradio 620 WTMJ that he had spoken to a friend inside the temple at the time.

&quot;My friend called and said, &#39;I heard the shot, and two people falling down in the parking lot.&#39; He saw the shooter reloading the gun,&quot; Mr Singh said.

Parminder Kaleka, who was waiting outside the temple, told the Milwaukee-Wisconsin Journal Sentinel that she had phoned her brother-in-law - who she said was a priest at the temple.

&quot;He told me 25 or more people got shot, at that time they don&#39;t even know if they are dead or alive, so a lot of people got injured.&quot;

She said distraught families had been gathered outside the temple waiting for news.

&quot;This is a big tragedy for our church,&quot; she said tearfully, adding that everyone had always assumed it would be a place of safety.

President Obama said he was &quot;deeply saddened&quot; by the incident.

&quot;Our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who were killed and wounded,&quot; he said in statement released by the White House.

&quot;As we mourn this loss which took place at a house of worship, we are reminded how much our country has been enriched by Sikhs, who are a part of our broader American family.&quot;

Local politician Mark Honadel called the attack &quot;craziness&quot;.

The state representative told CNN: &quot;Unfortunately, when this type of stuff hits your area, you say to yourself, &#39;why?&#39; But in today&#39;s society, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any place that&#39;s free from idiots.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was to support multiple people to create a militia at free will.  So youd have to piss alot of people off to have 12 or 7 people dead.</p>

              <p>Another one of these “GIVE MORE GUNS TO PEOPLE!” huh?</p>
<blockquote>Greenfield Police Chief Bradley Wentlandt: "We don't know if there are additional shooters inside the temple"
<p>At least seven people, including a gunman, have died in a shooting at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek in the US state of Wisconsin, police say.</p>
<p>The attacker “ambushed” a policeman at the scene, shooting him multiple times, before a second officer returned fire, killing the gunman, said authorities.</p>
<p>The shot officer was among three people injured in the attack.</p>
<p>Police say it does not appear that there was more than one shooter, as witnesses initially thought.</p>
<p>Tactical police teams have cleared the building.<br>
‘Terrorist-type incident’</p>
<p>President Barack Obama spoke of his sadness at the shooting, as he did after the gun massacre that left 12 dead at a Colorado cinema just over two weeks ago.<br>

<p>At a press conference, Oak Creek Police Chief John Edwards said they were treating the attack as a “domestic terrorist-type incident”, and that the FBI would take over the criminal investigation.</p>
<p>At least two reports earlier from inside the temple, or gurdwara, suggested the perpetrator was a white male.</p>
<p>The authorities said calls had been made to the emergency services at about 10:25 local time (15:25 GMT).</p>
<p>Four people were dead inside the temple and three outside - including the gunman, said the authorities.</p>
<p>“The best information is that there was only one gunman,” said Chief Edwards.</p>
<p>At least three critically wounded men were being treated at Milwaukee’s Froedtert Hospital, said officials at that facility.</p>
<p>They included the police officer who had been shot multiple times, although he was expected to survive, said Chief Edwards.<br>
‘Hiding in closets’</p>
<p>Oak Creek is a town of about 30,000 people in the south-east corner of the state.<br>

<p>The website for the temple says it opened in 1999 and now has a congregation of 350-400. Sunday morning was the busiest time of worship, members of the congregation said.</p>
<p>Sukhwindar Nagr told the Associated Press news agency he had called his brother-in-law’s phone. A priest at the temple answered and told him that his brother-in-law had been shot, along with three priests.</p>
<p>The priest also said women and children had been hiding in closets in the temple, Mr Nagr added.</p>
<p>Suni Singh told Newsradio 620 WTMJ that he had spoken to a friend inside the temple at the time.</p>
<p>“My friend called and said, ‘I heard the shot, and two people falling down in the parking lot.’ He saw the shooter reloading the gun,” Mr Singh said.</p>
<p>Parminder Kaleka, who was waiting outside the temple, told the Milwaukee-Wisconsin Journal Sentinel that she had phoned her brother-in-law - who she said was a priest at the temple.</p>
<p>“He told me 25 or more people got shot, at that time they don’t even know if they are dead or alive, so a lot of people got injured.”</p>
<p>She said distraught families had been gathered outside the temple waiting for news.<br>

<p>“This is a big tragedy for our church,” she said tearfully, adding that everyone had always assumed it would be a place of safety.</p>
<p>President Obama said he was “deeply saddened” by the incident.</p>
<p>“Our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who were killed and wounded,” he said in statement released by the White House.</p>
<p>“As we mourn this loss which took place at a house of worship, we are reminded how much our country has been enriched by Sikhs, who are a part of our broader American family.”</p>
<p>Local politician Mark Honadel called the attack “craziness”.</p>
<p>The state representative told CNN: “Unfortunately, when this type of stuff hits your area, you say to yourself, ‘why?’ But in today’s society, I don’t think there’s any place that’s free from idiots.”</p>
