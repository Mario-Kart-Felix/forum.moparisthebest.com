<p>Don’t you agree with the Republicans?<br>
Isn’t there anything in your holy constitution that could speak against the current system? Because the power isn’t with the people, but the two parties.</p>
<p>But the case in UK about FPP and AV showed that people are afraid of change.</p>

If you want any power, you must run under the 2 main parties, because there is no room for any 3rd party to grow. And if you see in the history, US have been stuck with the same parties for a long time.</p>
<p>Proportional representation is the only system that let new parties grow. Everything else is rubbish as explained in Yakman’s video.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Moparisthebest has a point. Government subsidies and public-private partnerships are often wasteful and inefficient. Many times they’re also tainted by nepotism.<br>
At the end of the day, national government prefers oligopolies (and even in some cases monopolies) on private goods and services, as they’re much easier to deal with and regulate. It shouldn’t surprise anyone that oligopolies behave much like monopolies, limiting the deflation of price level through under-the-table agreements and collusion.<br>
How do we let this happen? Simple: government is far too large, and far too indirect. This virtually closes the door for the people to manage their government, which ought to be as transparent as possible. Unfortunately, all this indirection brings greater and greater opacity to the way we are governed. It practically invites kleptocracy by lulling the people and creating a distinguished political elite.<br>
I ask a question: who has the power in our society? Is it really the common man?</p>
<blockquote>[b]The Relationship Between Wealth and Power[/b]
<p>What’s the relationship between wealth and power? To avoid confusion, let’s be sure we understand they are two different issues. Wealth, as I’ve said, refers to the value of everything people own, minus what they owe, but the focus is on “marketable assets” for purposes of economic and power studies. Power, as explained elsewhere on this site, has to do with the ability (or call it capacity) to realize wishes, or reach goals, which amounts to the same thing, even in the face of opposition (Russell, 1938; Wrong, 1995). Some definitions refine this point to say that power involves Person A or Group A affecting Person B or Group B “in a manner contrary to B’s interests,” which then necessitates a discussion of “interests,” and quickly leads into the realm of philosophy (Lukes, 2005, p. 30). Leaving those discussions for the philosophers, at least for now, how do the concepts of wealth and power relate?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">First, wealth can be seen as a “resource” that is very useful in exercising power. That’s obvious when we think of donations to political parties, payments to lobbyists, and grants to experts who are employed to think up new policies beneficial to the wealthy. Wealth also can be useful in shaping the general social environment to the benefit of the wealthy, whether through hiring public relations firms or donating money for universities, museums, music halls, and art galleries.</span></p>
<p>Second, certain kinds of wealth, such as stock ownership, can be used to control corporations, which of course have a major impact on how the society functions. Tables 5a and 5b show what the distribution of stock ownership looks like. Note how the top one percent’s share of stock equity increased (and the bottom 80 percent’s share decreased) between 2001 and 2007.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Third, just as wealth can lead to power, so too can power lead to wealth. Those who control a government can use their position to feather their own nests, whether that means a favorable land deal for relatives at the local level or a huge federal government contract for a new corporation run by friends who will hire you when you leave government. If we take a larger historical sweep and look cross-nationally, we are well aware that the leaders of conquering armies often grab enormous wealth, and that some religious leaders use their positions to acquire wealth.</span></p>
<p>There’s a fourth way that wealth and power relate. For research purposes, the wealth distribution can be seen as the main “value distribution” within the general power indicator I call “who benefits.” What follows in the next three paragraphs is a little long-winded, I realize, but it needs to be said because some social scientists – primarily pluralists – argue that who wins and who loses in a variety of policy conflicts is the only valid power indicator (Dahl, 1957, 1958; Polsby, 1980). And philosophical discussions don’t even mention wealth or other power indicators (Lukes, 2005). (If you have heard it all before, or can do without it, feel free to skip ahead to the last paragraph of this section)</p>
<p>Here’s the argument: if we assume that most people would like to have as great a share as possible of the things that are valued in the society, then we can infer that those who have the most goodies are the most powerful. Although some value distributions may be unintended outcomes that do not really reflect power, as pluralists are quick to tell us, the general distribution of valued experiences and objects within a society still can be viewed as the most publicly visible and stable outcome of the operation of power.</p>
<p>In American society, for example, wealth and well-being are highly valued. People seek to own property, to have high incomes, to have interesting and safe jobs, to enjoy the finest in travel and leisure, and to live long and healthy lives. All of these “values” are unequally distributed, and all may be utilized as power indicators. However, the primary focus with this type of power indicator is on the wealth distribution sketched out in the previous section.</p>
<p>The argument for using the wealth distribution as a power indicator is strengthened by studies showing that such distributions vary historically and from country to country, depending upon the relative strength of rival political parties and trade unions, with the United States having the most highly concentrated wealth distribution of any Western democracy except Switzerland. For example, in a study based on 18 Western democracies, strong trade unions and successful social democratic parties correlated with greater equality in the income distribution and a higher level of welfare spending (Stephens, 1979).</p>
<p>And now we have arrived at the point I want to make. If the top 1% of households have 30-35% of the wealth, that’s 30 to 35 times what they would have if wealth were equally distributed, and so we infer that they must be powerful. And then we set out to see if the same set of households scores high on other power indicators (it does). Next we study how that power operates, which is what most articles on this site are about. Furthermore, if the top 20% have 84% of the wealth (and recall that 10% have 85% to 90% of the stocks, bonds, trust funds, and business equity), that means that the United States is a power pyramid. It’s tough for the bottom 80% – maybe even the bottom 90% – to get organized and exercise much power.</p>
</blockquote><br>
Our socioeconomic and political systems have created a divide: the people and the elite. Sometimes they share common ends… but most of the time, they <span class="bbcode-i">don’t</span>.<br>
Given that our government is so bureaucratic and vulnerable to corruption, the common people are frequently scammed and companies unfairly gain an advantage over others.<br>
Does this mean the free market has all the answers? Surely not; public services (like health care, education, infrastructure, etc.) are more often than not best fit as <span class="bbcode-i">natural</span>, public monopolies. In an ideal democratic government, the people can exert plenty of control over these and it accurately reflects the will of the population.<br>
It should also be noted that oligopolies and monopolies <span class="bbcode-i">also</span> form in capitalist markets that are regulated too little as well. Wealth accumulates at the top, and it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone.

Ok, the question makes more sense now.  So where you live, the exhorbitant price of electric vehicles is heavily subsidized by government tax breaks and by bypassing tolls and such.

<p>The price for electric power vs gasoline is a big difference, even today, what I’m saying though is the price for an electric car vs a gasoline car today outweighs that difference, making gas cars cheaper when everything is considered.  I think this is still mostly due to the huge expensive batteries involved, and partially attributable to it simply being very new technology.</p>
<p>As far as government subsidization goes, you are mostly right, I’m against the high taxes necessary for subsidization, the one exception I can think of right now is some subsidies paid to farmers so they can sell crops so cheap, though I’d like to see what would happen if the free market took over. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I don’t understand the question?  Driving electric cars are much, much more expensive than even an older car that doesn’t get very good gas mileage.<br>

In Norway the price of driving a electric power is about 1/10th of gas. Half of the cost of the cars in this country is taxes, for electric cars this amount is 0%. And it is free to pass toll plazas (Something that can cost a bit if you need to pass it often)</p>

I don’t understand the question?  Driving electric cars are much, much more expensive than even an older car that doesn’t get very good gas mileage.  (because of the cost of electric cars, you would have to drive one for something like 18 years to just break even with a gas powered car, and that’s assuming your cost of maintenance wouldn’t be more on an electric car, and it would)<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>He probably meant tax-wise. Here in the Netherlands we have 3 kinds of car taxation. Firstly, the road tax, which is based upon the amount of CO2 the car emits. Then there’s the purchase tax, which also depends on the CO2 emission. A lot of cars are being leased, and when you drive more than 500 private km’s you are taxed too. This tax also depends on the emissions. Obviously, a hybrid or electric car emits less than the average American pick-up truck, so you pay less taxes.[/quote]</p>
<p>Ok, the question makes more sense now.  So where you live, the exhorbitant price of electric vehicles is heavily subsidized by government tax breaks and by bypassing tolls and such.  But without heavy government subsidation, which IMHO shouldn’t happen, they would still be far more expensive to drive.</p>
<p>As to the math, I don’t have the time to look up things and do the math myself again, but I’ll quote this slightly dated article for reference:</p>
<blockquote>For example, the Honda Civic Hybrid has a starting manufacturer's suggested retail price of more than $22,500 for a base, 2007 model. A 2007 Civic LX gasoline-powered sedan with many comparable amenities carries a starting MSRP that is some $4,800 less.
<p>True, the 2007 Civic Hybrid is rated by the EPA at 49 mpg in city driving and 51 mpg on the highway, for a combined 50 mpg. This is 30 percent better than the combined rating of 33 mpg for the gasoline-powered, 2007 LX model.</p>
<p>But even if a driver maximizes his or her fuel savings and gets the full 17-mpg benefit in the Hybrid, he or she would need more than a dozen years of 15,000-mile annual travel before the gasoline savings—calculated with gasoline at approximately $2.40 a gallon—would recoup the $4,800 extra paid for the Hybrid over the traditional Civic LX.</p>

I don’t think the government here is greedy<br>
[/quote]<br>
Aren’t all your leaders rich? How can you say they are not greedy? It seems that they are greedy with money and power.[/quote]<br>
My leaders? I’m from England.<br>
I just live here, terrible misconception<br>
They are rich because of the natural wealth their lands possess and because of heritage and hereditary reasons, they aren’t greedy, I can honestly tell you this<br>
The leaders here splash money to free people who are stuck in jails because they cannot pay out their debts and have to serve years and years or have served their term but cannot pay their bills to get out of jail.<br>
The leaders here do a lot . Trust me</p>

In Norway the price of driving a electric power is about 1/10th of gas. Half of the cost of the cars in this country is taxes, for electric cars this amount is 0%. And it is free to pass toll plazas (Something that can cost a bit if you need to pass it often)<br>
But I would like to see the math behind your statement.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Electric cars won’t be a big thing until their costs come down. People here spend big bucks on aston martins, murcielagos etc. Go to Jumeirah, it’s like a car show room of big worth cars.</p>
<p>However, electric cars cost a lot more at original purcahse (50,000 Dhs + here usually) and it’s usually due to their lithium batteries etc. Maintenance of these cars is inconvenient and so is the speed.<br>
Nevertheless, I believe Jaguar is planning to unveil a next gen car model that’s purely green<br>
Only thing is, it will cost quite a bit. General population will find it tough to be able to purchase these cars …</p>

Leaders from the UAE are freaking morons. The way they spend their money on projects that are useless is staggering. They should be ignored, they are themselves useless.<br>
[/quote][/quote]</p>
<p>If there is a separate topic on this, I’ll post my views<br>
But I generally agree with what you have said, they do spend needlessly</p>

<p>I agree that politicians shouldn’t earn too much. But they certainly should earn enough. BTW, most of your politicians earn a lot from lobby groups, which is a bad thing and IMO should be seen as corruption (actually, it is).</p>

<p>I don’t understand the question?  Driving electric cars are much, much more expensive than even an older car that doesn’t get very good gas mileage.  (because of the cost of electric cars, you would have to drive one for something like 18 years to just break even with a gas powered car, and that’s assuming your cost of maintenance wouldn’t be more on an electric car, and it would)</p>

<p>He probably meant tax-wise. Here in the Netherlands we have 3 kinds of car taxation. Firstly, the road tax, which is based upon the amount of CO2 the car emits. Then there’s the purchase tax, which also depends on the CO2 emission. A lot of cars are being leased, and when you drive more than 500 private km’s you are taxed too. This tax also depends on the emissions. Obviously, a hybrid or electric car emits less than the average American pick-up truck, so you pay less taxes.</p>
