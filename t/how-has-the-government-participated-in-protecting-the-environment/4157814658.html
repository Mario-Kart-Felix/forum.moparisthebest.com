radeon doesn’t ever think of economical consequences in his theories</p>
<p>id say tie tax breaks for the rich to carbon emissionsn INCLUDING their products. So dealers lose money for selling non-efficient cars<br>
[/quote]<br>
How is that economical? If dealers lose too much money, they will close down, sell fewer cars<br>
This wouldn’t exactly be economical[/quote]<br>
What? They just sell more efficient cars instead of bulking up prices on shit cars.</p>

</aside>
<p>It reduces the consumer demand for gas, so even if they are involuntarily helping the environment, it still counts.<br>
There are no income taxes or consumer taxes on products in Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman or Abu Dhabi for that matter. Some of the states I’ve named are not rich, not as rich as their neighbouring states which you probably have heard of. However, there are high taxes on cars, there are toll gates that charge about $2 every time you use the road and which is at least 4-6 times a day for some people.</p>
<p>Traffic congestion is a huge problem in the Sharjah-Dubai highways and these toll gates have worked in a way to reduce, causing people to use routes they would never have used before. I don’t think the government here is greedy</p>

<p>I don’t understand the question?  Driving electric cars are much, much more expensive than even an older car that doesn’t get very good gas mileage.  (because of the cost of electric cars, you would have to drive one for something like 18 years to just break even with a gas powered car, and that’s assuming your cost of maintenance wouldn’t be more on an electric car, and it would)</p>

<p>He probably meant tax-wise. Here in the Netherlands we have 3 kinds of car taxation. Firstly, the road tax, which is based upon the amount of CO2 the car emits. Then there’s the purchase tax, which also depends on the CO2 emission. A lot of cars are being leased, and when you drive more than 500 private km’s you are taxed too. This tax also depends on the emissions. Obviously, a hybrid or electric car emits less than the average American pick-up truck, so you pay less taxes.</p>

They are rich because of the natural wealth their lands possess and because of heritage and hereditary reasons, they aren’t greedy, I can honestly tell you this<br>
The leaders here splash money to free people who are stuck in jails because they cannot pay out their debts and have to serve years and years or have served their term but cannot pay their bills to get out of jail.<br>

Electric cars won’t be a big thing until their costs come down. People here spend big bucks on aston martins, murcielagos etc. Go to Jumeirah, it’s like a car show room of big worth cars.</p>
<p>However, electric cars cost a lot more at original purcahse (50,000 Dhs + here usually) and it’s usually due to their lithium batteries etc. Maintenance of these cars is inconvenient and so is the speed.<br>
Nevertheless, I believe Jaguar is planning to unveil a next gen car model that’s purely green<br>
Only thing is, it will cost quite a bit. General population will find it tough to be able to purchase these cars …</p>

<p>Ok, the question makes more sense now.  So where you live, the exhorbitant price of electric vehicles is heavily subsidized by government tax breaks and by bypassing tolls and such.  But without heavy government subsidation, which IMHO shouldn’t happen, they would still be far more expensive to drive.</p>
<p>As to the math, I don’t have the time to look up things and do the math myself again, but I’ll quote this slightly dated article for reference:</p>
<blockquote>For example, the Honda Civic Hybrid has a starting manufacturer's suggested retail price of more than $22,500 for a base, 2007 model. A 2007 Civic LX gasoline-powered sedan with many comparable amenities carries a starting MSRP that is some $4,800 less.
<p>True, the 2007 Civic Hybrid is rated by the EPA at 49 mpg in city driving and 51 mpg on the highway, for a combined 50 mpg. This is 30 percent better than the combined rating of 33 mpg for the gasoline-powered, 2007 LX model.</p>
<p>But even if a driver maximizes his or her fuel savings and gets the full 17-mpg benefit in the Hybrid, he or she would need more than a dozen years of 15,000-mile annual travel before the gasoline savings—calculated with gasoline at approximately $2.40 a gallon—would recoup the $4,800 extra paid for the Hybrid over the traditional Civic LX.</p>

        <p>You’re completely right, hybrids are more expensive than non-hybrids. According to my own calculations, it takes 11,8 years for a Civic hybrid to break even with a normal Civic (using the figures given by Honda, average mileage from 2006 and today’s gas prices). No wonder, the batteries are what makes a hybrid so expensive, which is partly because of the fact that it’s relatively new technology.</p>

<p>it’s not unheard of for world leaders to travel separately from their spouses, there was a big controversy a few years back when a bus driver refused the prime minister of new zealand to board the bus and asked her to travel on the spouses bus not knowing she was the prime minister</p>

<p>Ok, the question makes more sense now.  So where you live, the exhorbitant price of electric vehicles is heavily subsidized by government tax breaks and by bypassing tolls and such.  But without heavy government subsidation, which IMHO shouldn’t happen, they would still be far more expensive to drive.</p>

</aside>
<p>With tolls I meant paying for driving on some roads that didn’t get government subsidization.  But if you remove the taxes on gas, the price for driving a electric car is still 1/5th of the price of gasoline. But reducing the pollution is important, so tricking people into more environment friendly options is for the good of everyone.</p>
<p>But I think we have totally different view on what role the government should have. So I bet you wouldn’t accept subsidization for whatever reason.</p>

<p>The price for electric power vs gasoline is a big difference, even today, what I’m saying though is the price for an electric car vs a gasoline car today outweighs that difference, making gas cars cheaper when everything is considered.  I think this is still mostly due to the huge expensive batteries involved, and partially attributable to it simply being very new technology.</p>
<p>As far as government subsidization goes, you are mostly right, I’m against the high taxes necessary for subsidization, the one exception I can think of right now is some subsidies paid to farmers so they can sell crops so cheap, though I’d like to see what would happen if the free market took over. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
