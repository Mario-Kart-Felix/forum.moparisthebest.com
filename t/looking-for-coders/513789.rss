              <p>Take a look at our tutorial section for guides on how to run a server, we do not allow requests at the moment as they are against our rules.

              <p>Lol why don’t someone just tell him the quick basics he needs to know;</p>
<p>-Download java<br>
-download source and client<br>
-adjust your source and client for your java<br>
-Either portforward your port or use uTorrent to open your port (I made a program to open ports but don’t want to release due to many trolls saying it has a virus, if you like you can have the code in visual Basics, but uTorrent would be easier and quicker for you)<br>
-look at tutorials compare and contrast<br>
-READ the errors don’t just post it to server help because many errors are basic and tell you how to fix it!<br>
-advertise your server and play it amongst your friends</p>

              <p>This section isn’t to request help such as what you’re looking for, we have a tutorial section that provides all the essential links and tips to setting up a server. If you wish to getting into a server then you could join a development team and you never know, you may learn something new. One bit of a suggestion, don’t say you will be willing to pay for everything, you will most likely end up getting scammed of your money. The setting up of a server is quite easy these days you should have little problems considering the tutorial is easy to understand and with a little thinking anyone can do such a task.</p>
