    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-coders/513795</link>
    <description>&quot;Hey guys i&#39;m new to making a rsps. I haven&#39;t made one, and i&#39;m looking for help. I somewhat know how to make one. I want to give it a try because it would be good and considering that I can be online for countless hours. I have a job IRL and i&#39;m willing to put money into this. I just need help getting one up! I&#39;d be willing to promote whoever helps me to co-owner.
~Thanks&quot;</description>

              <p>i’ll help out. haven’t posted on here at all i don’t think. i have a pi source that i’ve been working on and will give to you. its 474 or something around there. its a blank source, has a lot of the basic stuff and has godswords/skillcapes but stuff like drops, npc dialogue, object functions, ect, needs to be added/fixed. just finished adding muting and banning commands(not including ipban). as for teaching, idk. i’m not the best at explaining a lot of stuff. at least i don’t think i am, never really been in the teaching position to be honest.</p>
