<p>LMFAO. There was a plan in vb. Then there was the real thing. If you looked at the arga leak you would see the semi of the real thing. The leak didnt have the final one i dont think because i realised anyone could download from our svn and so closed it lol.</p>

<p>Yup and it hasnt been changed again. We are on the final one. Its in full runtime, no runescape.jar no having to update. &lt;3 pplsuqbawls</p>
<p>No we do not use deobs wtf? We never ever have out of all our changes. Ive posted code for deobs but thats for others. You were asking me about them and i was saying how bad they were and why not to use them, in the end i said just do what you like. I believe you are working on a deob’d bot now?</p>

<p>The app section is now done by some mods, not by me, i didnt have the time to get all the apps done.</p>
<p>The bot is free and no, not public. Its only going to be given to people who write tuts, contribute and help out, aka non leachers. We dont want another Aryan thankyou ;).</p>

<p>no they just are unable to finish anything they start.<br>
They change the bot every few weeks.<br>
first wrapping, then reflection, then bcel, then deobs, now they are modifying something new and are looking toward color recognition.</p>
<p>funniest thing was the screenshots of the the gui coded in visual basic.</p>
<p>What they dont realize is i already made a color recogntion.</p>

<p>Lol, if you say so.</p>

</aside>
<p>LMFAO. There was a plan in vb. Then there was the real thing. If you looked at the arga leak you would see the semi of the real thing. The leak didnt have the final one i dont think because i realised anyone could download from our svn and so closed it lol.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>

</aside>
<p>Yup and it hasnt been changed again. We are on the final one. Its in full runtime, no runescape.jar no having to update. &lt;3 pplsuqbawls</p>
<p>No we do not use deobs wtf? We never ever have out of all our changes. Ive posted code for deobs but thats for others. You were asking me about them and i was saying how bad they were and why not to use them, in the end i said just do what you like. I believe you are working on a deob’d bot now?</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Stuff color reconition, we want things done by Ids’, Names etc for example, attackNPC(String name). Nice idea though, we wil have color reconition aswell, wont hurt.</p>
<p>The app section is now done by some mods, not by me, i didnt have the time to get all the apps done.</p>
<p>The bot is free and no, not public. Its only going to be given to people who write tuts, contribute and help out, aka non leachers. We dont want another Aryan thankyou ;).</p>
<p>Ruler the bot is in runtime &amp; BCEL and has been for a month.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>

</aside>
<p>? We dont modify anyting in the rs client so by what are you referring?</p>
<p>The bot is not just by me. It is by Zappacky, Iamadam, VirtualMaster, aswell.</p>
<p>Whether you think the bot is bs or not, it up to you. It wont stop it coming out.</p>
<p>Lol, and yes we are generally quite lazy =P.</p>
<p>Ruler i even end up giving you the npcArray that you were after for so long…</p>
<p>Rome wasnt built in a day.</p>

[/quote]<br>
I talk to all your devs, i give them code.  I have offered assistance.  they seem a bit fragmented on what is going on.<br>
Sorry the vb screenshots were offical and were posted on fagex and your own site so i assumed they were the bot.</p>
<p>Zappacky talks about getting scar source and colors.  that is COLOR RECOGNTION…<br>
I don’t think you know what some members of your team are planning.</p>

(7:34:36 AM) Zappacky: without giving RS a chance to know whats up<br>
(7:34:50 AM) Eric: i dont udnerstnad your 2nd comment<br>
(7:34:57 AM) Eric: i see your redirecting painting<br>
(7:35:09 AM) Eric: that cna be accomplished a ariety of ways<br>
(7:35:23 AM) Eric: their double buffering<br>
(7:35:42 AM) Eric: theirs modying teh awt.canvas and make it do wahtever you want<br>
(7:35:50 AM) Eric: their methods of doing it in windows<br>
(7:36:16 AM) Zappacky: its kind of like a gfx proxy<br>

(7:36:41 AM) Eric: i dont see how this is something new thou<br>
(7:37:20 AM) Eric: i cna run ibot miminzed but i am not gogin to realse it as of now<br>
(7:37:34 AM) Eric: scar is slow<br>
(7:37:50 AM) Eric: we were going to use it but it required us re-writting all their bitmap functiosn in delphi<br>
(7:38:02 AM) Eric: since we dont have source<br>
(7:38:09 AM) Eric: i rewrote it all in java<br>
(7:38:57 AM) Eric: you making a coor clicker?<br>
(7:39:08 AM) Zappacky: its one of ARGA’s features<br>
(7:39:22 AM) Zappacky: another will be a pascal interpreter<br>
(7:39:32 AM) Zappacky: actually<br>
(7:39:38 AM) Eric: iwould scratch that<br>
(7:39:43 AM) Zappacky: a SCARGA interpreter<br>
(7:39:55 AM) Eric: i wias going to write a converter<br>
(7:39:59 AM) Eric: i might still<br>
(7:40:04 AM) Eric: but see then tehir bitmap to string<br>
(7:40:09 AM) Eric: i was unabel to break that<br>
(7:40:13 AM) Zappacky: thats easy<br>
(7:40:14 AM) Zappacky: lol<br>
(7:40:21 AM) Eric: you know the method?<br>
(7:40:55 AM) Zappacky: not the exact method no. but its a relatively simple encoding<br>
(7:40:59 AM) Eric: lol<br>
(7:41:02 AM) Zappacky: ive seen it elsewhere<br>
(7:41:07 AM) Zappacky: i believe its a derivation<br>
(7:41:09 AM) Eric: it use to be hex<br>
(7:41:12 AM) Zappacky: if not the same<br>
(7:41:14 AM) Eric: it has changed<br>
(7:41:19 AM) Zappacky: duh lol<br>
(7:41:32 AM) Zappacky: i recognize hex when i see it<br>
(7:41:40 AM) Zappacky: 0x42 =<br>
(7:41:40 AM) Zappacky: B<br>
(7:41:42 AM) Zappacky: etc<br>
(7:42:00 AM) Zappacky: actylly<br>
(7:42:05 AM) Zappacky: thats ASCII<br>
(7:42:08 AM) Zappacky: but the hex is good<br>
(7:42:13 AM) Eric: well<br>
(7:42:21 AM) Eric: i wasnt abel to beat bitmap to string<br>
(7:43:08 AM) Eric: you guys still goign wiht bcel?<br>
(7:43:17 AM) Zappacky: yup<br>
(7:43:46 AM) Eric: did i telly uo i can go everywhere with reflection<br>
(7:44:19 AM) Eric: thinking that their might be a way to make rules for reflection based off of a deob<br>
(7:45:19 AM) Zappacky:  u can go everywhere wit reflect<br>
(7:45:26 AM) Zappacky: but reflection is so f****ing slow<br>
(7:45:31 AM) Zappacky: lol<br>
(7:45:41 AM) Zappacky: i mean were talking masochistically slow<br>
(7:46:27 AM) Eric: not really<br>

<blockquote>The beginnings of a SCAR interpreter...5 	virtualmaster 	24 	23 Jul 2006 05:55</blockquote>
<p>We are not just using Color Reconision as you said. We will be having things done via id’s, Names etc.</p>
<p>Annnnnd like i hinted.</p>

no they just are unable to finish anything they start.<br>
They change the bot every few weeks.<br>
first wrapping, then reflection, then bcel, then deobs, now they are modifying something new and are looking toward color recognition.</p>

<p>What they dont realize is i already made a color recogntion.[/quote]</p>
<p>Lol, if you say so.</p>
<blockquote>funniest thing was the screenshots of the the gui coded in visual basic.</blockquote>
<p>LMFAO. There was a plan in vb. Then there was the real thing. If you looked at the arga leak you would see the semi of the real thing. The leak didnt have the final one i dont think because i realised anyone could download from our svn and so closed it lol.</p>
<blockquote>They change the bot every few weeks</blockquote>
<p>Yup and it hasnt been changed again. We are on the final one. Its in full runtime, no runescape.jar no having to update. &lt;3 pplsuqbawls</p>
<p>No we do not use deobs wtf? We never ever have out of all our changes. Ive posted code for deobs but thats for others. You were asking me about them and i was saying how bad they were and why not to use them, in the end i said just do what you like. I believe you are working on a deob’d bot now?</p>
<blockquote>are looking toward color recognition.</blockquote>
<p>Stuff color reconition, we want things done by Ids’, Names etc for example, attackNPC(String name). Nice idea though, we wil have color reconition aswell, wont hurt.</p>
<p>The app section is now done by some mods, not by me, i didnt have the time to get all the apps done.</p>
<p>The bot is free and no, not public. Its only going to be given to people who write tuts, contribute and help out, aka non leachers. We dont want another Aryan thankyou ;).</p>
<p>Ruler the bot is in runtime &amp; BCEL and has been for a month.</p>
<blockquote>now they are modifying something</blockquote>
? We dont modify anyting in the rs client so by what are you referring?
<p>The bot is not just by me. It is by Zappacky, Iamadam, VirtualMaster, aswell.</p>
<p>Whether you think the bot is bs or not, it up to you. It wont stop it coming out.</p>
<p>Lol, and yes we are generally quite lazy =P.</p>
<p>Ruler i even end up giving you the npcArray that you were after for so long…</p>
<p>Rome wasnt built in a day.</p>
<p>Toodles.</p>
