<p>Username: judostar<br>
Age: 15<br>
Time of coding: during the week about 1-2hours(after i’m done my homework) and weekend about 5-6hrs.<br>
Experience of Coding: 6 months - a year.<br>
Why you want to join: 562 custom, seems interesting<br>
How many first projects have you made: lemme count, armscape, unreleased DerbyScape, unreleased iClarity based Project 05/06, currently working on armscape v2. <span class="bbcode-b">So about 4 almost 5</span><br>
What can you do best on coding: Npcs, fixing a few bugs, coding some skills, etc.(Don’t bug me to code herb, cause that’s the most pain in the ass skill to code)<br>
Best coding skill (npc dialogue and stuff): Best thing I’ve coded so far is probably re-doing everything that some kid fucked up, (fucked up everything from npcs to some skills)<br>
how much time u are free to help: weeknights 1-2hrs, weekends 5-6hrs.<br>
Where do you live: Canada, GMT -5<br>
(this is needed so i can tell on what time you are online, i need a team that can be online at the same time)<br>
at what time can you be online (24hrs): anywhere on weekends from 8am-10am and on. On week nights, about 7/8pm(could change).<br>
why do you like RSDW: I like that you can actually code, unlike some idiots who hire me and force me do to everything.<br>
Your favotite versions (562, 508 ect.): normal 317, rsc, 474, I’m okay with 508/525 and I like 562s, 614s, 634s, etc. But I hate revisions loading higher cache like 317 loading 634 cache.</p>

<p>I AM VERRY SORRY!<br>
the coding team for the 562 has bin aborted. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
due to the fact that the v2.5 508 is now hosted and ready to play online.<br>
the 6 of you who applied to help on the 562 are now being sent a PM with the abbility to send me an acc user and pass to become immidiate MODS.<br>
once again im sorry but working on the online version is a bit more important now.<br>
as MODS you will be asked to report any bugs or abnormalitys in the game so i can fix, also you will get a special trick to help me add npc dialogue by simply clicking on one thing, NO HARD WORK!<br>
also when u are a MOD be sure to start your username with “MOD” (capital M, O and D)<br>
the rest may be entered manualy.<br>
also as MODS you will get new items and features before the other player get them or can do them in the game.<br>
i will also add a special event at ur b-day, and as RuneScape there will be holiday events all around the game world.<br>
i will add a command for players to suggest events or items.</p>
<p>Greetz DemonWars.<br>
(once again I AM SORRY)</p>

              <p>[quote=“DemonWars, post:1, topic:415295”]Greetings i am DemonWars.</p>
<p>You may know me from my latest release: RuneScape DemonWars v2 508 HD Custom</p>
<p><img src="http://i1131.photobucket.com/albums/m558/jimjhonson/logos2.gif" alt width="254" height="252"></p>
<p>You need a E-mail adress to keep contact.<br>
you also need to be able to run the server.<br>
NEVER:<br>
tell me your password related to RuneScape, email or this site.<br>
if i choose you you will need to make a email adres with your moparscape name, so that no personal info can be leaked, and i can recognize u better<br>
when selected you will get a PM where ill be asking you to make a new email for me to invite u on, i will use a new email for this team myself (for the 3 selected i will use my standard demonwars email adress)<br>
NEVER PM ME WITH THE QUESTION TO JOIN!</p>
<p>To get a chance of entering you mus reply with this form:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Username: 
Age: 
Time of coding: 
Experience of Coding: 
Why you want to join: 
How many first projects have you made: 
What can you do best on coding: 
Best coding skill (npc dialogue and stuff): 
how much time u are free to help: 
Where do you live: 
(this is needed so i can tell on what time you are online, i need a team that can be online at the same time)
at what time can you be online (24hrs): 
why do you like RSDW: 
Your favotite versions (562, 508 ect.): </code></pre>
<p>Please BE HONEST! if u lie you wont get any chance of being selected!</p>
<p>If you are a 562 coder and u can understand the basics, and you can help me with the following coding:</p>
<p>1: NPC Dialogue with 3 options.<br>
2: NPC combat<br>
3: NPC VS NPC Combat coding<br>
4: Combat coding<br>
5: magic coding<br>
and all other stuff ill ask when i need help, but these are just basics there is just so much to do that i cant do it all that fast.</p>
<p>when this server will be released and put online u will also be MODs or as my ranks go “Demon Moderator”</p>
<p>u dont get this by telling me u will help, but instead u do nothing i asked you to do.</p>
<p>if u get chosen u will have to prove yourself, dont think you get nothing for being a mod.</p>
<p>when u get to be a MOD you will get the following things:</p>
<p>1: MOD status in game<br>
2: A special transformation when in game, every mod gets his own transformation<br>
this will have the following:<br>
//1: minnions that will fite for u<br>
//2: you can also transform into all other monsters exept the ones from other mods<br>
//3: your transformation is unique, you are the only one who has it.<br>
//4: a special atack!<br>
3: spawn option for all stuff<br>
4: ::jail command, this will not work on mods or me<br>
5: ::tele command (also teletome and teleto)<br>
6: ::copy command, this will give u the exact same armor and looks as the targeted player, this will not work on mods or me<br>
7: a ::report command, this will send me a report message in game , when i will tele him and you to me for questioning (i always save conversations of all players to keep track of their dialogue)<br>
8: a special MOD armour with your name, if u get aproved you may tell me what kind of armor u want<br>
9: when in safe zone u can ask me for permission to “Demonize” this means that u get an attack option and all other players in the area too, and u may all battle (i will answer immidatly if possible)<br>
10: u may hold drop partys anywhere u like!<br>
11: u may ask me to come anytime u like, and if im not busy ill come and assist u or ill tele u to me.<br>
12: SECRET<br>
i will keep adding special stuff for mods, ill keep this updated.</p>
<p>(THIS IS NO ADVERTISMENT!!)</p>
<p>The higher of a rank you are the more u get.</p>
<p>I need 3 more mods at the moment.</p>
<p>I have: 4 Mods<br>
(including the mods i already have)</p>
<p>Places left: 3<br>
Users pending for entry: 3</p>
