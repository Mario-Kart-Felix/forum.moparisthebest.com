Why do you want to join the development team?: (leave this blank, if you are not gonna join development team)<br>
Show your graphic design(Leave this blank, if you aren’t going to apply for graphic designer) Many of this stuff is old and I’ve only ever designed stuff for YT. But i can still make good stuff if you have an idea of what you want. <a href="http://brooksy0.deviantart.com/gallery/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://brooksy0.deviantart.com/gallery/</a><br>
What you good at?: First of all, im quite good at communicating with teams, I take friendly approaches with players and team members in order to get loads of stuff done without any conflicts. I have also devved a few RSPS’s in my time. I was a former ex-dev @ tizenX before it became famous. I wouldn’t say I am the best graphic designer as i do it more for a hobby, but i try my hardest in all of my work.<br>
Anything else you would like to add?: I think i’ve included everything <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Thanks for reading my application .</p>
