    <description>Does anyone want to make a pure staking server? Where you could set your stats and you would start with like 5 sets of full rune and d longs to stake and just try to get as rich as you can with your staker and there could be other monsters that drop d meds, axes , and sqrs so those items are still rare. And there would be your usual mage shop and stuff if you want to be a mage. But instead of starting in edgeville you would start in draynor the staking capital of rsc. Idk how to make a server but I thought this would be an amazing idea for a server so tell what you guys think and please no flaming its just an idea if anyone wants to make a server based off of it please do so.</description>

              <p>rscpk isn’t like what I described at all and what is terrible about rscpk is that evreyone is lvl 123 and its stupid trying to pk because you can never hit people and evreyone of course uses magic so your sitting there not able to hit the person wasting food because your getting hit by fire wave no fun in that at all.</p>

              <p>I never said items were easy to get just cause you start with 5 sets of rune dosen’t mean the items will be easy to get. 5 sets of rune and d longs isn’t alot especially in staking and whats the fun in working for evreything the fun part comes at getting your stats, items, and staking.</p>
