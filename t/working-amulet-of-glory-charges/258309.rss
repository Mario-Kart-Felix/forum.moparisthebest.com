    <title>WORKING Amulet of Glory Charges?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/working-amulet-of-glory-charges/258309</link>
    <description>Hi, im still kind of new to editing servers, but i think i have the basics down, such as moving things, editing shops and players making and deleting things (ect). Now im trying to find a TuT(s) on how to make amulet of glories work for deltascape (if possible). such as right click &quot;Rub&quot; and have it ask you where to go (Edgeville, Draynor Village, and Al-Kharid). i know theres one more place but it&#39;s not needed. 
My Help Question is:
Can someone Help me With the Amulet of Glories? u can make them, but they dont work... and i want them to work
Please either post a TuT or PLEASE help me
