    <title>Need help setting up a server, 7 hours and no luck</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-setting-up-a-server-7-hours-and-no-luck/384809</link>
    <description>I swear I&#39;ve checked every youtube video and tutorial I could find, I am completely out of luck. Everything is just a dead end.
I want one thing, to make a private server that me and my friends can play on, and start from scratch.
I don&#39;t want a server that gives me 100m gold and full dragon (though the option would be nice)
I don&#39;t really care about stat editing (but the option would be nice, using like a notepad or something)
I don&#39;t care if we use Hamachi (actually would prefer it)
I just want to have fun. I want a normal server that starts you off at tutorial island or the starting zone or whatever, just a normal server that my friends can play on. I have some basic computer knowledge, which is why I find it so pathetic that I can&#39;t get a RuneScape server up when I can get World of Warcraft and MineCraft servers up.
Please, I&#39;ve been at this for 7 HOURS! My friends are counting on me to set up this server, we have about 5 of us and we&#39;d all do different jobs (WC, Mining, Etc. One of us would be a mage, an archer, a warrior, etc. Fun time, right?)
If you think you can help me set up a server that would let me do all these things (the latest one possible, please. Like 614 or something. I stopped playing a LONG time ago, so to explore some of the new stuff would be fun. anything over 550 would be neat. Actually, I&#39;ll take anything at this point.) PLEASE find some way to contact me. Skype or something, not really sure how you guys would communicate, I don&#39;t use MSN or anything. 
PLEASE! This would be SUPER awesome, I hear you guys are the best guys to go to.</description>

              <p>I just skimmed through reading… been helping other people, sounds like your doing a 317 though :9. But anyways, have you tried download a different source just to see? And also, the Command Prompt aka “black box” lol, it can be set to disappear or not disappear by right clicking on it and then clicking “Properties”, and it should say auto-hide. Un-check that. And, the JDK version has nothing to do with it, tbh, the higher and more updated the better for us. Um, and yeah, you all will need to use the same client to connect, unless you can manually get the client to connect yourselves.  But mind posting all your problems in a single post for me? Like every single one of them :9?</p>

              <p>Hmm… Sounds simple. I read that and it sounds easy, then I go to do it and…<br>
I can’t find config.java :(! I’m using the server he linked, the MyServer one. Btw it’s insanely unstable, it runs, but there are almost no NPCs and quests are glitched and when you click a skill, nothing happens. Sorry if I’m being a MASSAVE noob here, I swear I’m not some 10 year old who WANS TO MAEK RUN ESCAPE SURVAR.<br>
I think my problem is that there are like over 9000 clients and sources, so we may have different programs. Do you think you could link or something the exact programs you’re using? YouTube didn’t work so well, 99.99% of it are people typing with notepad.<br>
Thank you for all your help so far.</p>
<p>EDIT: After rereading your post, I noticed you talked about PI. Exactly what is that? You said it’s stable, I’m guessing it will at least have NPCs and such. Kinda stinks not being able to do quests or talk to people. Also what version of the server is it? (Like 5XX, 6XX, 3XX, and such.) You also talked about a way to contact you, that’d be super great. I feel like being able to interact with someone and work through it would be really awesome.</p>

<li>download hamachi</li>
<li>put the hamachi ip of YOUR connection on the client</li>
<li>any source as long as it works and is PI so I can help you with the rest</li>
<li>go in config.java to change exp rates somewhere at bottem is the skilling rates and at top tells you how much exp you get when u hit a 1 if you set it to 100 then when u hit a 2 you get 200 exp that applies for defence attack mage range strength and possibly some others that arent shown in your skill multiplier the skill multiplier goes by multiplication its that much times more than the real rs i set those to 45 for some 55 for some and 65 for some thats good rates :\ in my opinion i set the combats to 100 exp per hit. It has 3 melee range and magic put those to 100 if u want<br>
I am about to edit this and help you with the rest let me look over your post</li>
<li>for the starter go to player assistant search for public void addStarter() {</li>
<li>Starter location located in config.java really simple to change theres one for when u start and when you die</li>
<li>something you didnt ask but you should know the home tele if your planning on changing homes click that (in magebook) when it teles you type ::mypos you should have it if your put as rights = 3 search for the x or y until you find something that has  both of them exactly right and then change it to the new homes coords again ::mypos</li>
<li>to change yourself to rights = 3 (owner) mod = 1 rights and admin = 2 rights and 4 is either hidden or donator go in data characters open your chars name and look for player rights change it to 3</li>
</ol>
<p>thats all you asked for i think if u have any troubles (if you have pi) i would be glad to help through teamviewer if i have extra time. Lol and youve been waiting 7 hours that sux. I prefer PI its not the easiest to code delta is easier but PI is wayyyy better and most of them are more stable.</p>

I can’t even get that tutorial to work. Maybe it’s because I’m on Windows 7 or because I’m using jdk1.6.0_24. I don’t know where to find an older one.<br>
This is way WAY WAY WAY harder than it should be.</p>

I’ve only been able to create a private server but it was very crappy since i didn’t know how to edit it or make it an online server :(.

              <p>I swear I’ve checked every youtube video and tutorial I could find, I am completely out of luck. Everything is just a dead end.<br>
I want one thing, to make a private server that me and my friends can play on, and start from scratch.<br>
I don’t want a server that gives me 100m gold and full dragon (though the option would be nice)<br>
I don’t really care about stat editing (but the option would be nice, using like a notepad or something)<br>
I don’t care if we use Hamachi (actually would prefer it)<br>
I just want to have fun. I want a normal server that starts you off at tutorial island or the starting zone or whatever, just a normal server that my friends can play on. I have some basic computer knowledge, which is why I find it so pathetic that I can’t get a RuneScape server up when I can get World of Warcraft and MineCraft servers up.<br>
Please, I’ve been at this for 7 HOURS! My friends are counting on me to set up this server, we have about 5 of us and we’d all do different jobs (WC, Mining, Etc. One of us would be a mage, an archer, a warrior, etc. Fun time, right?)<br>
If you think you can help me set up a server that would let me do all these things (the latest one possible, please. Like 614 or something. I stopped playing a LONG time ago, so to explore some of the new stuff would be fun. anything over 550 would be neat. Actually, I’ll take anything at this point.) PLEASE find some way to contact me. Skype or something, not really sure how you guys would communicate, I don’t use MSN or anything.<br>
PLEASE! This would be SUPER awesome, I hear you guys are the best guys to go to.</p>
