    <title>Time to upgrade hardware</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/time-to-upgrade-hardware/540076</link>
    <description>A few months ago I purchased a new GPU and PSU, along with a case to harbor new hardware, and I&#39;ve finally decided to upgrade my stock CPU and motherboard. I&#39;m having a problem finding a good pair, since I have to make sure the following conditions are met:

[ul][li]The motherboard fits in my case. (My case will fit any motherboard up to the size ATX and WILL NOT fit E-ATX)[/li]
	[li]The motherboard socket matches the CPU socket[/li][/ul]
I don&#39;t necessarily think the first problem will be an issue, since there aren&#39;t too many motherboard that won&#39;t fit my case. Anyways, the original combo that I was planning on getting were these two:
Motherboard: [url=http://www.amazon.com/ASRock-Z87-CrossFireX-Motherboard-EXTREME4/dp/B00CZXYH8G/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392361299&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=asrock+lga1150]http://www.amazon.com/ASRock-Z87-CrossFireX-Motherboard-EXTREME4/dp/B00CZXYH8G/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392361299&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=asrock+lga1150[/url]
CPU: [url=http://www.amazon.com/Intel-i7-4770K-Quad-Core-Processor-BX80646I74770K/dp/B00CO8TBQ0/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392361157&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=intel+i7+4770k]http://www.amazon.com/Intel-i7-4770K-Quad-Core-Processor-BX80646I74770K/dp/B00CO8TBQ0/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392361157&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=intel+i7+4770k[/url]


The one thing I noticed right off is that the CPU socket wasn&#39;t labelled as LGA1150, which would be a big issue with the motherboard above, so I scrolled down to view the hardware, and where it says &#39;Compare to Similar Processors&#39; it says Socket H3 (1150). Is this the same thing as LGA1150, and if not, would my motherboard still support it?

Also, the reason I would like to go with this motherboard is due to the results of the benchmarks [u][url=http://www.cpubenchmark.net/high_end_cpus.html]here[url][/u]. Unless I&#39;m mistaken and am not able to read a chart, it seems that it provided the best performance : price ratio for its score. If you have any suggestions for a better setup (keeping the price somewhat close to the current one), then I would be grateful, but it seems like if these sockets fit, the output should be great. Another reason is the possibility for overclocking this processor later, although I&#39;m not that big of a fanatic when it comes to tweaking hardware as much as possible.</description>

They’re both LGA1150 (both pages say this).<br>

<p>I would also use pcpartpicker website to assist with compatibility/current sells on websites such as newegg[/quote]<br>
Thank you so much for the site recommendation. I was able to find the same motherboard for like $20 cheaper, and it will also ship faster than the previous seller.</p>

<p>Yes, this was the biggest question I had about the processor, so thanks!</p>
