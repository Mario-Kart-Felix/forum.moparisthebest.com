    <title>PK Scoreboard</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pk-scoreboard/515967</link>
    <description>Hi, I have a few scoreboards around my world on my RSPS.
I use an AllStar 317 Source, and I was wondering how I can get the scoreboards to show PK logs.
Example:
Mod Cody has killed Timmy
or how many kills each player online has.

Right now the scoreboards only show the players online, and anyone can see that by typing the command ::players
Please help. Thanks.</description>
