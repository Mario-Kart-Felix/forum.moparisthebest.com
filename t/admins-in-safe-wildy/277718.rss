    <title>Admins in safe wildy</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/admins-in-safe-wildy/277718</link>
    <description>I have a safe wildy you dont lose items but admins are unattackable everywhere in server since they can ::pickup. And when they die from monsters they dont lose their shit. I want it to be so there only attackble in safe wildy by other admins. And they can only attack other admins.
They already keep there stuff but how do i make it so they can only be
attacked by other admins and they dont drop stuff.</description>

you make them un-attackable by all players. You can pick between the lines. So you should just pick which is more important. So bottom line<br>
you shouldnt really make it where admins can attack because its an unfair advantage.</p>
<p>Example:<br>
they hit harder.<br>
they have unfair items.<br>
they will ban players who kill them.</p>
