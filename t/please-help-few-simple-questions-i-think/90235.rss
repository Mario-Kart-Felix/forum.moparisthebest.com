    <title>Please Help, Few simple questions(i think)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/please-help-few-simple-questions-i-think/90235</link>
    <description>Ok, well i just got the &quot;starter scape&quot; thing to start my server, i did it all and changed the name, but when i run the server and log on, it has a window when you first log on that says &quot;welcome to starterscape!&quot; - how do i change that and the other stuff thats on that window. The next question is, How do i make myself owner. The next question is, how do i change where people are in the game and make them have a store selling items  make then talk. The next question is this: When i ran starterscape i noticed that it is a PK server and i only want to make PKing in sertain places like THE WILD, and DUAL ARENA. The next question is how to make commands for: The Owner only(me), The co-owner only[b](WHO EVER HELPS ME BUILD THIS SERVER WILL GET CO-OWNER!)[/b], The Admins only, The mods only, and the players only. THANKS i think that these are the last of my questions for now, sorry if there was guides for these but i could not find them.</description>
