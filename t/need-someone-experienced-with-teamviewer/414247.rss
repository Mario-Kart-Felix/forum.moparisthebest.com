              <p>Broham, your thinking they need rep to be good? I could sit here helping noobs with at least 15 rep all day and rack up on reputation points. IVainI is one of the awesomest runescape coders and he has 10 rep. If your having java errors just download the latest java and JDK. You must have both java and JDK. Hope I helped. Tip: Don’t help for rep. Help to be nice. Being helpful puts me in a good mood. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/cool.png?v=5" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"></p>
