    <title>How to set up 317Serv- A simple guide</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-set-up-317serv-a-simple-guide/371424</link>
    <description>Ok, so Mendorphin&#39; s post on setting up Hyperion prompted me to write a guide on 317Serv. Nobody has really used it, and I think that is because the source itself came with no means of running or even compiling the source. I will provide you with these means ;D

[b]Difficulty: 1/10[/b]
[b]Requirements: An IDE with Apache Ant support, the client I will upload for you, Common Sense[/b]

Strangely, the server has problems running in an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), but for this tutorial you will need one in order to compile the source. I will be using an XML script (Apache Ant) to compile the source files. You will not need 317Serv.iml, 317Serv.ipr, or 317Serv.iws, just delete them. They are used for IntelliJ IDEA, a different IDE that I will not be including in this tutorial. You can find the original thread on this server [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=309081.0]here[/url].

[u][b]Required Files [/b][/u]
317Serv- http://www.megaupload.com/?d=CD8GLDLB
317 Deob Client- http://www.mediafire.com/?nunqoedllu5p590
An IDE- http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ , http://netbeans.org/downloads/

Eclipse, if you already don&#39; t know, must be extracted from a .zip file while Netbeans installs from an executable. Choose either one, it all depends on your preference. For this tutorial, I will be using Netbeans. To set up the server in Eclipse, you can use Mendorphin&#39; s tutorial on setting up Hyperion using the files I give you.

[u][b]Running and Compiling the Server[/b][/u]

This is the batch file you will use to run the server. Save it as &quot;run.bat&quot;.
[code]@echo off
cd out\production\317Serv
start javaw Main
exit[/code]

this is the XML file you will use to build the server. Save it as &quot;build.xml&quot;.
[code= xml]&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;project name=&quot;317Serv&quot; default=&quot;build&quot; basedir=&quot;.&quot;&gt;
	&lt;path id=&quot;classes&quot;&gt;
		&lt;fileset dir=&quot;out\production\317Serv&quot; includes=&quot;**.class&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;/path&gt;
	&lt;target name=&quot;init&quot;&gt;
		&lt;mkdir dir=&quot;out\production\317Serv&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;/target&gt;
	&lt;target name=&quot;build&quot; depends=&quot;init&quot;&gt;
		&lt;javac srcdir=&quot;src&quot; classpath=&quot;${toString:libs}&quot; destdir=&quot;out\production\317Serv&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
[/code]

The main question that sparked my mind when I wrote the run and compile files for this base was, &quot;Why doesn&#39; t the server have some sort of library folder?&quot;. I was wrong, the libraries in this source aren&#39; t jarred. They are in their .class form, so don&#39; t let that confuse you. Also if you look, the run.bat is set to exit out of the command prompt after it is executed. This is because Yz85Racer included a server control panel, so you don&#39; t need the command prompt while running the server. Heres a pic of the control panel.

Alright moving on.

[u][b]Eclipse[/b][/u]
You can follow Mendorphin&#39; s tutorial on setting up a server with Eclipse, found [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,467475.msg3418238.html#new]here[/url]. Remember that the server cannot be run in an IDE, so you will have to go into the files manually and execute the batch file yourself. Otherwise you will get errors. So just follow his tutorial up to &quot;So you now have Hyperion uploaded to Eclipse.&quot;.

[u][b]Netbeans[/b][/u]
Ok open up Netbeans and click File, New Project.
[IMG]http://imgur.com/Puet4.png[/img]

An interface will show up asking you what kind of project you would like to start. Select Java, Java Free-Form Project. This type of project allows you to use your own means of building the project, just like it says in the description. Now click next.
[IMG]http://imgur.com/Q84To.png[/img]

The next part is pretty self explanatory. You select where the pre existing files are (the server that you downloaded), where your build script is (it should be in the same file as the server), and where you would like the project data to be stored. The location of the project data doesn&#39; t really matter, I just keep it with the server files as well so that they are all in one place. After selecting the location of your files, all of the other options will be configured for you automatically by Netbeans.
[IMG]http://imgur.com/Jgsqv.png[/img]

Then all you have to do is click Next, Next, Finish. To start looking editing files, you have to go to the upper left hand corner of the screen and change the view to Files instead of Projects.
[IMG]http://imgur.com/Twygo.png[/img]

Now that the project is set up, it is time to test out the build script. You can compile the project by going into your files, then right click build.xml, click Run Target, then click Build.
[IMG]http://imgur.com/8gptH.png[/img]

Now you are ready to run the server! Simply go to the folder that you stored the files in and click &quot;run.bat&quot;. It might take a while at first to start, don&#39; t be alarmed, the control panel eventually comes up on the screen and binds to port 43594.

[u][b]Logging In[/b][/u]
Alright if you have gotten this far, your almost done! Using the client I put up for download, you can log into the server. Keep in mind that you can change the automatic login credentials (mopar, bob) in client.java. Another thing to note is that if you have a longer password than your username, you will get errors when you try to log in. I have no idea why, that&#39; s just how this source works in it&#39; s raw form.

[u][b]Conclusion[/b][/u]
Now that you have finally logged in, you can start working on the source! The server is pretty blank and needs quite a bit of work in order to function and entertain a community of players, but this will help you get started. Enjoy.

[u][b]Credits[/b][/u]

              <p>Ok, so Mendorphin’ s post on setting up Hyperion prompted me to write a guide on 317Serv. Nobody has really used it, and I think that is because the source itself came with no means of running or even compiling the source. I will provide you with these means ;D</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Difficulty: 1/10</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Requirements: An IDE with Apache Ant support, the client I will upload for you, Common Sense</span></p>
<p>Strangely, the server has problems running in an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), but for this tutorial you will need one in order to compile the source. I will be using an XML script (Apache Ant) to compile the source files. You will not need 317Serv.iml, 317Serv.ipr, or 317Serv.iws, just delete them. They are used for IntelliJ IDEA, a different IDE that I will not be including in this tutorial. You can find the original thread on this server <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=309081.0" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Required Files </span></span><br>
317Serv- <a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=CD8GLDLB" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.megaupload.com/?d=CD8GLDLB</a><br>
317 Deob Client- <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?nunqoedllu5p590" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.mediafire.com/?nunqoedllu5p590</a><br>
An IDE- <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/</a> , <a href="http://netbeans.org/downloads/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://netbeans.org/downloads/</a></p>
<p>Eclipse, if you already don’ t know, must be extracted from a .zip file while Netbeans installs from an executable. Choose either one, it all depends on your preference. For this tutorial, I will be using Netbeans. To set up the server in Eclipse, you can use Mendorphin’ s tutorial on setting up Hyperion using the files I give you.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Running and Compiling the Server</span></span></p>
<p>This is the batch file you will use to run the server. Save it as “run.bat”.</p>
<p><code>@echo off
cd out\production\317Serv
start javaw Main
exit</code></p>
<p>this is the XML file you will use to build the server. Save it as “build.xml”.</p>
<p><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;project name="317Serv" default="build" basedir="."&gt;
	&lt;path id="classes"&gt;
		&lt;fileset dir="out\production\317Serv" includes="**.class"/&gt;
	&lt;/path&gt;
	&lt;target name="init"&gt;
		&lt;mkdir dir="out\production\317Serv"/&gt;
	&lt;/target&gt;
	&lt;target name="build" depends="init"&gt;
		&lt;javac srcdir="src" classpath="${toString:libs}" destdir="out\production\317Serv"/&gt;
	&lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
</code></p>
<p>The main question that sparked my mind when I wrote the run and compile files for this base was, “Why doesn’ t the server have some sort of library folder?”. I was wrong, the libraries in this source aren’ t jarred. They are in their .class form, so don’ t let that confuse you. Also if you look, the run.bat is set to exit out of the command prompt after it is executed. This is because Yz85Racer included a server control panel, so you don’ t need the command prompt while running the server. Heres a pic of the control panel.<br>
<img src="http://img239.imageshack.us/img239/6171/snapshot10am7.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Alright moving on.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Eclipse</span></span><br>
You can follow Mendorphin’ s tutorial on setting up a server with Eclipse, found <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,467475.msg3418238.html#new" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. Remember that the server cannot be run in an IDE, so you will have to go into the files manually and execute the batch file yourself. Otherwise you will get errors. So just follow his tutorial up to “So you now have Hyperion uploaded to Eclipse.”.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Netbeans</span></span><br>
Ok open up Netbeans and click File, New Project.<br>
<img src="http://imgur.com/Puet4.png" alt width="242" height="451"></p>
<p>An interface will show up asking you what kind of project you would like to start. Select Java, Java Free-Form Project. This type of project allows you to use your own means of building the project, just like it says in the description. Now click next.<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://imgur.com/Q84To.png" title="Q84To.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://imgur.com/Q84To.png" alt width="690" height="473"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">Q84To.png</span><span class="informations">725×497</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>The next part is pretty self explanatory. You select where the pre existing files are (the server that you downloaded), where your build script is (it should be in the same file as the server), and where you would like the project data to be stored. The location of the project data doesn’ t really matter, I just keep it with the server files as well so that they are all in one place. After selecting the location of your files, all of the other options will be configured for you automatically by Netbeans.<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://imgur.com/Jgsqv.png" title="Jgsqv.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://imgur.com/Jgsqv.png" alt width="690" height="494"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">Jgsqv.png</span><span class="informations">723×518</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>Then all you have to do is click Next, Next, Finish. To start looking editing files, you have to go to the upper left hand corner of the screen and change the view to Files instead of Projects.<br>
<img src="http://imgur.com/Twygo.png" alt width="381" height="313"></p>
<p>Now that the project is set up, it is time to test out the build script. You can compile the project by going into your files, then right click build.xml, click Run Target, then click Build.<br>
<img src="http://imgur.com/8gptH.png" alt width="383" height="396"></p>
<p>Now you are ready to run the server! Simply go to the folder that you stored the files in and click “run.bat”. It might take a while at first to start, don’ t be alarmed, the control panel eventually comes up on the screen and binds to port 43594.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Logging In</span></span><br>
Alright if you have gotten this far, your almost done! Using the client I put up for download, you can log into the server. Keep in mind that you can change the automatic login credentials (mopar, bob) in client.java. Another thing to note is that if you have a longer password than your username, you will get errors when you try to log in. I have no idea why, that’ s just how this source works in it’ s raw form.</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://imgur.com/bA43z.png" title="bA43z.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://imgur.com/bA43z.png" alt width="690" height="474"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">bA43z.png</span><span class="informations">766×527</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Conclusion</span></span><br>
Now that you have finally logged in, you can start working on the source! The server is pretty blank and needs quite a bit of work in order to function and entertain a community of players, but this will help you get started. Enjoy.</p>
