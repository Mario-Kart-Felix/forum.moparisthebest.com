    <description>Project Sagan

Hello guys, I&#39;m currently working on an allstar-based project called &#39;Project Sagan&#39;. Well, obviously, I am looking for some helpers. I am mainly searching for 

[i]- 2 server-devs[/i]
[b]And a client-dev[/b]

Once the project&#39;s ready to go online. (not sure if it ever will be ready, but we&#39;ll see.) I can get a vps. Then i&#39;ll also look for some web-developers and such.

Anyways, 

what does the source include?

- A client class of 1MB (already lowered by 500KB). Still needs to get cleaned by a lot.
- Redone magic, i&#39;d say it&#39;s 70%. There are working projectiles, decent hit calc, but I still need to add NPC poisoning stat lowering, and spell GFX&#39;s.
- Redone crafting
- Redone firemaking
- Redone herblore
- Working prayers (except for headIcon prayer, melee, and magic.) I still need to find a fix. The method I tried in Npchandler caused disconnecting..
- A custom minigame. You can see it by watching the showoff page. Tho it is really outdated. I have added a lot since then.
- Working castle wars
- Working on duel arena (probably won&#39;t add staking since that will most likely bring a lot of dupes, and I probably won&#39;t have a clue on how to do so lol)
- Much more to think of, i might edit this thread.
