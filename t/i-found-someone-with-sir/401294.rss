    <title>I found someone with Sir</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-found-someone-with-sir/401294</link>
    <description>Idk how to make this topic into a title so there&#39;s the shitty title.
I found somebody with a username and before his username was &quot;Sir&quot; in a peach color.

When I asked him how he got his name like that, he logged out.
He has been speaking Spanish.</description>

              <p>[quote=“I Vain I”]jagex makes millions from their membership payments of the playerbase. they honestly don’t need the adsense, they only want more money. moparscape makes a few thousand a month off the server status page, which mitb doesn’t even touch the money. when mscp users start paying for the site/server’s memberships and mitb makes millions a year, then you can compare them. until then, use your brain.[/quote]If you pay for membership on Runescape, they say ‘Ok we recognize you are spending money on this game, we now will remove the advertisements from our game page for you’, which I’m sure if you payed attention you will notice. In some of their fun orb games, they actually put effort into <span class="bbcode-i">removing</span> advertisements on the game page if you log in with a member account. They do this with all of their other games as well. Not to mention they spend a <span class="bbcode-b">lot</span> more on upkeep than this site. They have lots of employees (that make pretty good salaries), they pay for office space, server upkeep, a good web host and more. You can compare them just fine, this site wouldn’t need to have advertisements either, it’s just Moparisthebest’s choice to use the ad money for server space rather than from the status page.</p>
