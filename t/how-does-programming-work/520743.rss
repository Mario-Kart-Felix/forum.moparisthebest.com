    <title>How does programming work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-does-programming-work/520743</link>
    <description>i know how to code i self taught myself and i understand most of it but i sense im missing something i feel like what i do is more code manipulation instead of programming and by that i mean i can take a look at a source code i can understand what the program is attempting to do i can manipulate code to make it preform the way i want and i can fix code that i myself write but the one thing i haven&#39;t been able to teach myself is where all code originates from im not capable of writing new code from scratch because of this and as a result my skills are severely limited to code manipulation can someone please explain what it is im missing</description>

<p>I know that binary is a base 2 number system it dates to the 17th century; binary is the foundation of digital systems, obviously various machines predate it, good examples are the abacus the analytic engine and the jacquard loom but these were not digital. (sorry about the commas lol)</p>
<p>Binary is the basis of digital computing thus, we begin there.</p>

              <p>Programming is just logic. You combine logic to make more logic and just constantly build upon that. You need to understand the fundamentals of programming, which can generally be applied to any language; you understand the concept of variables, functions and memory. You then learn from example by looking at others’ code and try apply that to other problems. Mainly it’s just practice, you need to create situations that feel impossible to solve and then solve them. Do this repeatedly and remember you need to write thousands of lines of terrible code to learn to write efficient code.</p>

Most beginner tutorials go over this, in whichever language you decide to use. In the beginning everyone had to write programs in binary(011010100). Over time they created languages that are just compiled into binary code, making it easier for humans to set commands for computers to execute. &lt;- Super simple answer</p>

<p>yes im fairly familiar with binary however you seem to be telling me to code in binary which is impossible or at least highly inefficient the language im most familiar with is java im not really asking for origins like in the beginning stuff im asking as a person makes a program from scratch what point do they start at maybe libraries or api’s?[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m not telling you to write in binary. I’m just telling you that languages are interpreted and then computed in binary. Therefor you can code in plain english(sort of lol), and the compiler and computer do all the heavy work. As for libraries, it’s really hard to tell you what libraries to use. Obviously the main java api is going to be used in literally almost all of your applications, so I guess start there. But honestly, you just learn to write a basic program. If you need to write something more complex, like, a server or something, then you learn libraries you need to efficiently write that(like <a href="http://java.io" rel="nofollow noopener">java.io</a> and java.nio). If you can give a more specific question it will be easier for us to answer <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>i know how to code i self taught myself and i understand most of it but i sense im missing something i feel like what i do is more code manipulation instead of programming and by that i mean i can take a look at a source code i can understand what the program is attempting to do i can manipulate code to make it preform the way i want and i can fix code that i myself write but the one thing i haven’t been able to teach myself is where all code originates from im not capable of writing new code from scratch because of this and as a result my skills are severely limited to code manipulation can someone please explain what it is im missing</p>
