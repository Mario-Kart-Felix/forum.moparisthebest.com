–noun</p>
<ol>
<li>a person who has never had sexual intercourse.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>In the majority of women, the hymen is sufficiently vestigial as to pose no obstruction to the entryway of the vagina. The presence of a broken hymen may therefore indicate that the vagina has been penetrated but also that it was broken via physical activity or the use of a tampon or dildo. Many women possess such thin, fragile hymens, easily stretched and already perforated at birth, that the hymen can be broken, or merely disappear, in childhood, without the woman's even being aware of it.
<p>In contrast to the common cases of an absent or partial hymen, in rare cases a woman may possess an imperforate hymen, such as prevents the release of menstrual discharge. A surgical procedure known as hymenotomy, which creates an opening in the hymen, is sometimes required to avert deleterious health effects. The playwright Ben Jonson claimed that Queen Elizabeth I of England, the Virgin Queen, had a “membranum” that made her “incapable of Man”, and that a friend of hers, a “chirurgeon”, had offered to remedy the problem with his scalpel and that Elizabeth had demurred.</p>
<p>The presence of a hymen is a possible indication, but no guarantee, of virginity, given that it is speculated that some degree of sexual activity may occur without rupturing the hymen and because there may exist varying definitions as to the type and extent of sexual activity that is required to terminate the state of “virginity”.</p>

<p>A (virgin) girl I knew back in the day stacked it roller blading, she landed on a curb and broke her hymen. By your logic she lost her virginity to a curb?</p>
<p>A girl can also get fingered and have her hymen broken, and still be a virgin because it wasn’t a penis.</p>

Where do you live man, jesus christ.</p>
<p>Ontopic: Anyway, 15 still a virgin, probably wouldn’t do it now unless it’s a gf. Otherwise older. 14 down too young, too immature and whatnot.<br>
Don’t know how you guys would want to do it/have done it younger. Perhaps it’s just my thinking - i’m more into the ‘love’ part and stay with your girlfriends.</p>
