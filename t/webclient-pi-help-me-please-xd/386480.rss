    <title>Webclient PI Help me please xD</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-pi-help-me-please-xd/386480</link>
    <description>Hey everone may this sound realy dumb but i just started with using PI bases and ive downloaded a good sourch and a client. 
My client downloads the cache Automaticly from a direct downloading site. Thats fine. But I wanted to make a PI webclient. Everthing is already done in the client im pretty sure. (CacheDownloader.java, Signlink done, Client.java done etc) it also has one jarred file in the client that is named &quot;client&quot;

If i place the HTML code into my page it wont work. Im pretty sure i forgot something but cant find anything in all those PI webclient tuts..
(May something with the jarred client idk)

Hope you can help me :S

Thank you.
