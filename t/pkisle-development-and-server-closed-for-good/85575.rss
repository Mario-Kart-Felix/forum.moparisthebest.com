    <description>PkIsle Players, The Server is officially dead.  Bezza recently got a new job which keeps him busy so he has no time to run it or develop it.  Please DO NOT PM Me anymore and don&#39;t complain.
All you people who bought PkIsle Items for RuneScape/Real Money you need to take it up with Bezza, not me.
Thats All.</description>

<p>i could host it on hamachi for you, i don’t want this server to go dead! it was really good! i havent gotten my no-ip to work yet, but it hink i have! this DOES NOT deserve to go down.</p>

<p>No offense fishypoo, but I think it should go to someone 100% reliable and experienced. Someone who didn’t even get their no-ip address working is not really what I had in mind.</p>
