    <title>Stardock Boot screen problem how to fix</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stardock-boot-screen-problem-how-to-fix/120674</link>
    <description>I encountered A problem when I download boot screen. I deployed the boot screen and when I restarted my computer. My windows wouldn&#39;t start. You MUST dual boot and then you must delete the program when you are in dual boot. This is the only way I have found to fix this.. I use stardock on my laptop 24/7 but boot screen is A no/no.



Also I dont want to hear shit like you are retarted if you dont know how to use boot screen. I used it perfect. I dont know what happened but there was An error and when I applied the bootscreen it ( I am asuming) confused(haha yah I said confused)my comp and forced it into wondows error screen. Idk if i am only one that got this but I did and wanted to help if someone else got it....</description>
