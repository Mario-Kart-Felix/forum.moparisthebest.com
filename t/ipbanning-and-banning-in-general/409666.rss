Your residence was gone Tom, you need to come back and re-establish it.  Also, do you care if I remove the wall between us?  I’m not worried about potential mob problems.<br>

<p>Go ahead, I also couldn’t reestablish it because Evil_ was the one who protected it and he was mining in the mines irl.</p>

<p>I’ll try to get on tomorrow to show you the route.  Basically you head directly towards spawn. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Does this have anything todo with the xauth being disabled on the server?</p>
<p>EDIT: I’ve changed my password also my ip is 74.243.210.152 and under whois should show up as Gaston, SC 29053 anything other than that is not me. Is it possible for you to find out who’s behind this?</p>
