    <description>Now I&#39;m sorry but, Where is the equality in this? 

This country is pissing me right off now... Long story short. A Pastor was fined in Nottingham for making too much noise during service.
Yet all over the country Mosques have loudspeakers on the roof that constantly go off and can be heard across whole towns and they get away with it?

I&#39;m not racist but the equality in this country has gone to shit, Couple weeks ago (As a previous topic states) a *WHITE* guy got sent to prison for remarks against muamba the football player.

Yet the Asian guy that said remarks of similar nature about the 6 british soldiers that died, His charges got dropped?

Last year two guys got a heavy fine (and i think they had short prison terms too) For spray painting a poppy on a mosque (Yes i know this is graffiti but that isnt my point)
But all the *ASIANS* Burning poppys (for Poppy appeal / armed forces day) got fuck all done to them.

What makes all this worse is there are plenty of other storys (even ones told by police officers i know) Of asians commiting crime and getting let off with it to avoid the police being deemed racist. It sickens me the amount of stuff they get away with because the slightest bit of trouble they get in and they cry &quot;RACISM&quot;

Lets not forget that alot of these wastes of life claim benifits from the UK government too. If they hate this country so much then they should GTFO.


&lt;blockquote&gt;A Nottingham gospel church pastor has been fined for making too much noise, the city council has revealed.

Deacon Everton Lewis-Gordon and pastor Sean Samuel of New Generation Church on David Lane, Old Basford, appeared before city magistrates in March.

The charges against Mr Lewis-Gordon were withdrawn but Mr Samuel was fined £360 and ordered to pay costs of £300 for causing a noise nuisance.

Nottingham City Council said the case was prompted by dozens of complaints.

Four-year battle

Alex Norris, Nottingham City Council&#39;s portfolio holder for community safety and area working councillor, said: &quot;We have tried everything we can to bring this matter to a resolution without resorting to court.

&quot;Unfortunately, over a prolonged period of time, the unacceptable noise levels - sometimes above the traffic noise on the busy road - have not reduced and we have felt that prosecution was the only option to us.&quot;

According to the council, residents living near the church have been complaining about the noise levels for four years.

Noise pollution officers judged the volume of noise coming from the services to be a nuisance under the Environmental Protection Act after recording sound levels during services, some of which would last up to three hours.

Mr Lewis-Gordon and Mr Samuel appeared at Nottingham Magistrates Court on 21 March charged with causing a noise nuisance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>Tell me that’s jail worthy? Now it’s cruel to talk that way about soldiers fighting for your country, but when they’re out invading/terrorising another country the context is different. His post wasn’t pure hate or racist, he was just expressing his frustration at the lack of sympathy to the Afghans who have suffered from the war(s) although he did get carried away near the end.</p>

<p>I went over this in a recent thread, he got sent for jail for some really fucking racist remarks, he pleaded guilty and was banged to rights because he didn’t have a defence worth shit</p>
<p>if he had said that in a pub I’m sure he would have been sent to hospital, and I’m sure some neo-nazis would have made the same arguments you are now “a <em>WHITE</em> guy got sent to hospital for remarks against muamba the football player. kick the blacks out of the country”</p>
<p>but of course you don’t say “kick the asians out the country”, you just say “if they don’t like it they should gtfo”, same song different tune</p>

<p>been down your local jobseekers recently? plenty of white, english people claim jobseekers allowance and are equally a “drag” on society, would you propose kicking them out of the country too?</p>
<p>for the record, I’m also a waste but I don’t claim jobseekers out of principle, I don’t necessarily need it right now, but there are MANY people that do, it’s why IT’S THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE</p>
<p>also for the record, helping to support the lower class by giving them benefits, while not the best solution, is a lot better than having them out on the street which costs society more in healthcare bills than it does for benefits</p>
<p>on a somewhat related note, if you can’t see why racial hate towards the majority shouldn’t be prosecuted as much as racial hate against a minority, you seriously need to adjust your world-view</p>

              <p>Now I’m sorry but, Where is the equality in this?</p>
<p>This country is pissing me right off now… Long story short. A Pastor was fined in Nottingham for making too much noise during service.<br>
Yet all over the country Mosques have loudspeakers on the roof that constantly go off and can be heard across whole towns and they get away with it?</p>
<p>I’m not racist but the equality in this country has gone to shit, Couple weeks ago (As a previous topic states) a <em>WHITE</em> guy got sent to prison for remarks against muamba the football player.</p>
<p>Yet the Asian guy that said remarks of similar nature about the 6 british soldiers that died, His charges got dropped?</p>
<p>Last year two guys got a heavy fine (and i think they had short prison terms too) For spray painting a poppy on a mosque (Yes i know this is graffiti but that isnt my point)<br>
But all the <em>ASIANS</em> Burning poppys (for Poppy appeal / armed forces day) got fuck all done to them.</p>
<p>What makes all this worse is there are plenty of other storys (even ones told by police officers i know) Of asians commiting crime and getting let off with it to avoid the police being deemed racist. It sickens me the amount of stuff they get away with because the slightest bit of trouble they get in and they cry “RACISM”</p>
<p>Lets not forget that alot of these wastes of life claim benifits from the UK government too. If they hate this country so much then they should GTFO.</p>
<blockquote>A Nottingham gospel church pastor has been fined for making too much noise, the city council has revealed.
<p>Deacon Everton Lewis-Gordon and pastor Sean Samuel of New Generation Church on David Lane, Old Basford, appeared before city magistrates in March.</p>
<p>The charges against Mr Lewis-Gordon were withdrawn but Mr Samuel was fined £360 and ordered to pay costs of £300 for causing a noise nuisance.</p>
<p>Nottingham City Council said the case was prompted by dozens of complaints.</p>
<p>Four-year battle</p>
<p>Alex Norris, Nottingham City Council’s portfolio holder for community safety and area working councillor, said: "We have tried everything we can to bring this matter to a resolution without resorting to court.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, over a prolonged period of time, the unacceptable noise levels - sometimes above the traffic noise on the busy road - have not reduced and we have felt that prosecution was the only option to us.”</p>
<p>According to the council, residents living near the church have been complaining about the noise levels for four years.</p>
<p>Noise pollution officers judged the volume of noise coming from the services to be a nuisance under the Environmental Protection Act after recording sound levels during services, some of which would last up to three hours.</p>
<p>Mr Lewis-Gordon and Mr Samuel appeared at Nottingham Magistrates Court on 21 March charged with causing a noise nuisance.</p>
