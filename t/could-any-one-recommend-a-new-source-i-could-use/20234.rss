    <title>Could ANY one recommend a New Source I could use</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/could-any-one-recommend-a-new-source-i-could-use/20234</link>
    <description>After my old source failed me (I have no Idea why  :|  it works for everyone else - [glow=red,2,300]Testscape[/glow]) I need a new one, but have no idea which sources are any good.

I am really looking for one with [u]all[/u] fully working skills and just a few NPC&#39;s So i can mould it into my own creation.

[glow=red,2,300]So which would you recommend[/glow]

If you&#39;ve read this please reply...[br][size=1]Posted at: October 27, 2006, 05:52:55 AM[/size][hr]So no-one Knows any decent Sources...

<p>I wasn’t sure what was up with it, But after talking to Mod Taharok he said that it was to do with my Compile.bat. After fixing that He eventually said I should change my Source, hence the reasoning for this Topic.</p>
<p>Do you guys have any idea what is up with it?[br][size=1]Posted at: October 27, 2006, 09:03:53 AM[/size][hr]May have fixed it not 100% certain.</p>

              <p>Why did testscape fail you? did you get the 100 errors while adding something?<br>
I have a little tip for it, save your client.java and compile after every thing you add, then you can see where the errors is and fix it, all sources out now are testscape based, and testscape is cheezscape based, so basicly, there is no source without errors.</p>
