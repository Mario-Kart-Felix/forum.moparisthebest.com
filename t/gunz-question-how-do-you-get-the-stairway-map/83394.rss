    <description>GunZ Question - How do you get the Stairway Map?

On free channels, I see Stairway map in so many places. I googled &quot;gunz stairway&quot; and got some interesting results. Turns out I need to decompile some system.mrs file and then download the map from another website. So it&#39;s not a secret map in GunZ. It&#39;s just a map made by hackers to play on. :) Still very cool, and I would like to do that myself without injecting my computer with viruses/keyloggers. 

Anyone know how? Because there are many more maps than the Stairway map.</description>

<p>When GunZ comes out of Beta, if they can, they should add a Map Editor where people can create their own maps, and then play on them. Anyone who doesn’t have that map will have to download it from that person, and then can freely use that map. Just like in Age of Mythology. Mmmm a lot of work I suppose. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
