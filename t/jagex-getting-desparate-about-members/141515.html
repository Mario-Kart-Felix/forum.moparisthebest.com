<blockquote>Dear 0o0o0o0o73,
<p>Thank you for your question.</p>
<p>At Jagex we always aim to respond to every message we receive from our players individually and as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to the massive growth in popularity of RuneScape and the increasing number of queries that brings, we have not been able to keep up, and are not able to offer a personal response this time. We are increasing the size of our customer support unit and hopefully the next time you need help you will be able to get a quick answer!</p>
<p>We always give priority to answering all member queries personally, but we are now aiming to answer more free player queries. This number will increase even more in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Why not consider becoming a member and help support the continued development of the game? Plus you’ll also get a range of extra features and benefits like four extra bank pages, exclusive quests and you get no adverts that can sometimes put you off your game.</p>
<p>As a Member you also get access to the Forums which can usually answer any query you have allowing you more time to play the game.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="http://runescape.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">RuneScape.com</a> has a wealth of information available to players in the knowledge base section. You will find the answers to most questions in here, whether it be billing, technical, or game related.</p>
<p>Once again many thanks for your query, and apologies that we cannot give a personal response at this time.</p>
<p>I hope that this helps resolve your problem.</p>
<p>Please always refer to the RuneScape Knowledge Base to find the answer to your queries quicker.</p>
<p>You can also find help on all free player and all new member quests through the QuestHelp system.</p>
<p>Yours Sincerely<br>
Mod Dowd</p>

<p>Ok this is not about losing 200k, i just thought it is funny that they ask everyone to be a member everywhere.</p>
