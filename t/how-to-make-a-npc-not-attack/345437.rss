    <title>How to make a npc not attack</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-a-npc-not-attack/345437</link>
    <description>Hey guys im using Summon-Pkz V2 the server source and theres jad out in the wild, I was wondering if anyone knows how to make it so it doesnt attack. Also I was wondering if anyone has the client so the items in the shops are not nulled, If not then thats fine by me, Ill just have to add in the models which is a big pain in the ass. Anyways, Thanks!</description>
