        <p>Hello(please move to models section if it goes their not sure),<br>
I know that no RSPS I’ve ever seen has had working spirit shield’s I’ve raped google searching for a guide or even mention of a fully working or even 10% working spirit shields.<br>
Its clear it must be hard to make it as my analysis of making it it’d require a lot of coding (professional even) a good 5-6hours of non stop work from a really good programmer.<br>
Does anybody have any information about this? The closest idea I have is work out a ratio for bonus’s on the shields to absorb 17.5% 30%(or whatever shield it is) but what would you base it on? Would you base the bonus’s added on of damage ratio’s made by a player(sorry if this bit doesn’t make sense im not experianced).<br>
Also even if this were to work, their would be no prayer drain and it still doesn’t seperate the server that has it from the rest.</p>
<p>Also i’d like to add in(if requested i’ll remove this part of the thread) if it were possible (without like 2 weeks non stop work or something) would anyone that knows their stuff be willing to make it for me for $100 or a max of $150? As im nowhere good enough to add it in.<br>
I know thats a small price for what i’d be asking done but you could most probibly (assuming people are willing to part with donations to improve their server) get like 5-10 people that’d pay like $100 each also so it could be a nice profit. Or even release it after you’ve received the money, that would be ideal so everyone can benefit. I will also give you 100% credits for doing so in my server if that would make a difference.</p>
<p>If their is a guide which I have somehow missed can someone please give me it though? I really do think its worth the effort.</p>
