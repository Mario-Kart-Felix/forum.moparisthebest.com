              <p>Low-end torque. Ever heard of LS1? read up on it. They get about 30mpg or so. Also, new Corvette ZO6 pushes 505 hp and gets (mpg city / hwy / combined): automatic: 18 / 25 / 21. Not saying they get better than anything, but since you seem to think they guzzle gas to nothing, I thought I’d inform you. Also, I read, on <a href="http://allpar.com" rel="nofollow noopener">allpar.com</a> somewhere, that the 1976 featherlite or featherlight (cant remember) Duster got 36mpg highway and the reg got 30.</p>

My parents giving me the Tiburon next year. It was either that or a Silverado truck, which isnt anything to show off to your friends.</p>
<p>Even though the truck is better, I wanted the Tiburon because it’s sporty, despite the fact it’s handling is terrible and same with gas.<br>

<p>jme, ill drive up to canada and kick your ass if you choose that POS foreign car over a nice chevy truck which is faster, more dependable, and all around better than that little car :mad: ;)[/quote]</p>

<p>Yeah well I should have mentioned I am only allowed to have it for highschool and college. Maybe when I head off to college I can use the truck instead, but while I am still in highschool I’d like the tiburon. When I’m older I’ll buy myself an american car just for you <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
