<p>This is the procedure from my AWE chopper:</p>

end;</p>
<p>[/scar]</p>
<p>Don’t just go and use that, let me explain. Alot of those other things in there are procedures I am calling. Don’t worry about those. This basicly what you need:</p>
<p>[scar]<br>
if findcolorspiral(x,y,WC1,3,3,515,336)or<br>
findcolorspiral(x,y,WC2,3,3,515,336)or<br>
findcolorspiral(x,y,WC3,3,3,515,336) then<br>
mmouse(x,y,2,2)<br>
if(IsUpTextMulti(‘Chop’,‘op’,‘Ch’)) then<br>
Mouse(x,y,0,0,false)</p>
<p>[/scar]</p>
<p>Now let’s break that down.</p>
<p>[scar]<br>
findcolorspiral(x,y,WC3,3,3,515,336)<br>
[/scar]</p>
<p>That is the function that searches for the color. The x,y are its coords, just leave those. The WC3 is the constant that the people set at the begining of the script. It is the color the script will search for. You can have them fill in a constant, or fill in the color that you pick from the tree. The 3,3 are the tolerance. It find the X,Y coords of the COLOR(WC3) that it finds, and will be somewhere within the TOLERANCE of 3 PIXELS of where it finds it. The 515,336 is the area in which it is searching, the RS client. Just always keep those there if you are searching for something in the RS client. Got it? Lets move along.</p>
<p>The “IF” in front of it means that if it finds the color it will do the next thing. The “OR” means that if it finds ‘This Color’ Or ‘This Color’ it will do the next thing. Got it? Now for the next part:</p>
<p>[scar]<br>
mmouse(x,y,2,2)<br>
[/scar]</p>
<p>This part tells the computer to Move the Mouse to the place where it finds the color. MMouse is short for MoveMouse. Remember the X,Y coords we used above? Well Mmouse(x,y) means it will move the mouse to the X,Y coords it found the color on. Pretty cool eh? The 2,2 again is the TOLERANCE. It will move the mouse to the X,Y coords within the TOLERANCE of two pixels.</p>
<p>Now for the last part:</p>
<p>[scar]<br>
if(IsUpTextMulti(‘Chop’,‘op’,‘Ch’)) then<br>
Mouse(x,y,0,0,false)<br>
[/scar]</p>
<p>The first part is saying that if the script spots any of the MULTIPLE text it will THEN do the next thing. We use many texts (multiple) just to make sure to get it. ‘Chop, ‘op’, and ‘Ch’ will make sure the script finds that text in the corner of the client where it says ‘Chop’. The Mouse(x,y) is like MMouse. Instead of moving the mouse though, it clicks the mouse on the same X,Y coords. The 0,0 is the tolerance so it means it will click with a TOLERANCE of 0, or in other words it will click on the exact spot the x,y coords the mouse has moved to. The ‘false’ part means that it will left click. You can also say ‘True’ for it to left click’.</p>
<p>Well, I hope that helped you if you need any help or have questions PM me or post. Also my MSN is <a href="mailto:Jiwman88@hotmail.com">Jiwman88@hotmail.com</a></p>
