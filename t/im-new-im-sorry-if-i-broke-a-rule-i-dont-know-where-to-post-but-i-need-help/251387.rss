    <description>Okay so I have a MacBook, Im trying to use a auto-miner on runescape for Exp. I did some research(give me a little credit), and found out that I needed to download Darwine, to be able to use SCAR, on the MacBook. So I did that but I dont know what to do, so I did more research, and found out I need to download x11. So im downloading that. And did more research and found out i needed freetype, so i downloaded that. Okay now I got like these 5 programs Ive never used before, and im okay with computers but not nearly as good as most of you Techs. out there. So im asking for a bit of help. Maybe explain a few things to me in great detail, and step by step directions, then if this question comes up again, bam! there is the answer! Im sorry if I posted in the wrong area I just really need help. email me if you would like mannfl79@yahoo.com[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 19, 2008, 02:59:23 pm[/size][hr]CRAP SORRY I TOTTALY BROKE THE RULES!
