    <title>Map Editing [pi]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/map-editing-pi/526537</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, I was wondering what map editor to use for the source Sinatra which is a Project Insanity. I am new to editing modules in the cache :o. I was just wondering if there&#39;s a link that has a download link with a tutorial on how to use it. It would be greatly appreciated if anyone helps me out! :) Thanks!

Kind regards,
