    <description>Wow im actually going to this community for advice.
None the less.

Could someone help me with the following:

Code that if Dogbot is on or off, gives out a certain Send Message.
[This is placed BELOW &#39;Loading Please wait&#39; so when this message appears to load the maps, it says this in the chatbox]

[code]
	if(dogbot == true)          
       	pushMessageMethod77(&quot;Dog Bot is currently On!&quot;, 0, &quot;&quot;, aBoolean991);
       	pushMessageMethod77(&quot;Welcome to Dog Bot, A bot made by Dog Eats Dog&quot;, 0, &quot;&quot;, aBoolean991);
	if(dogbot == false)
       	pushMessageMethod77(&quot;&quot;, 0, &quot;&quot;, aBoolean991);
                {
[/code]

The boolean placed with all the others.

[code]
    public boolean dogbot = true;
[/code]

And the commands placed with all the other commands.

[code]
                         if(aString887.equals(&quot;::dogon&quot;))
                        {
		dogbot = true;
                        }           
                         if(aString887.equals(&quot;::dogoff&quot;))
                        {
		dogbot = false;
                        }          
[/code]


Now here is the problem.
When dogbot is on, It works PERFECTLY.
when it says &quot;Loading please wait&quot; it says what it says above.
Now when you type ::dogoff to turn it off..
It works good aswel.
Except for the fact it displays the text from DogOn aswell.
Here is a picture of what i mean.

Seee?
[Sorry for the BLK picture on the bottom, Something happened idk.]

No as you can see, when dogbot is off it is displaying its text [Which is Nothing] [As you can see here]

[code]
	if(dogbot == false)
       	pushMessageMethod77(&quot;&quot;, 0, &quot;&quot;, aBoolean991);
                {
[/code]

BUT!
It is also displaying 1 line of Dog On?
As you can see in the picture, above the Space is :

[code]
       	pushMessageMethod77(&quot;Welcome to Dog Bot, A bot made by Dog Eats Dog&quot;, 0, &quot;&quot;, aBoolean991);
[/code]

How the FUCK do i not make that show up when dogbot is off.

Thanks.

P.S
This is just an experiment, If anyone says &#39;Why not just make a void and a timer&#39; or anything else like that i will slap you.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 18, 2008, 09:49:08 pm[/size][hr]Everyone here Handicapped?</description>

<p>Also, you can substitute your dogon and dogoff commands for one command that toggles the status of the bot:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(aString887.equalsIgnoreCase("::dogtoggle"))
{
    dogbot = !dogbot;
    pushMessageMethod77("Dog Bot is now "+(dogbot ? "on!" : "off!"), 0, "", aBoolean991);
}</code></pre>
