<p>wow so sophisticated wow netty omg grahams game engine wow over 1000 players</p>
<p>putting grahams engine into your shitty pi server will not effect it’s performance and has no real effect on the server at all. The ‘1000 players’ were not real players, they were bots. You can’t really replicate 1000 players without actually having 1000 different players</p>
