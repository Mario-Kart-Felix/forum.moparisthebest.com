Yeah, you said it!  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>On a serious note though, there are so many ex staff because this community is actually quite old. It’s natural that over the years people will come and go. Some of us are a little more attached than others though and didn’t really leave permanently.<br>
I stepped down because I was busy with work and university at the time.</p>
