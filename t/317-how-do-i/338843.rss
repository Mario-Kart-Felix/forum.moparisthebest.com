    <title>[317] How do I</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-how-do-i/338843</link>
    <description>I was looking through my client.java in my server source and I came across this code that seems to be some sort of welcome interface. I was wondering if it would be possible to make this work when I log in... 

[code]	public void openWelcomeScreen(int recoveryChange, boolean memberWarning,
			int messages, int lastLoginIP, int lastLogin) {
		outStream.createFrame(176);
		// days since last recovery change 200 for not yet set 201 for members
		// server,
		// otherwise, how many days ago recoveries have been changed.
		outStream.writeByteC(recoveryChange);
		outStream.writeWordA(messages); // # of unread messages
		outStream.writeByte(memberWarning ? 1 : 0); // 1 for member on
		// non-members world warning
		outStream.writeDWord_v2(lastLoginIP); // ip of last login
		outStream.writeWord(lastLogin); // days
	}

[/code]

There might be more things related to this in other files in the source but I was wondering if I could make this work...</description>
