    <title>Where are my track people?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-are-my-track-people/385491</link>
    <description>Well considering I&#39;ve seen a ton of posts involving track, track practice, etc, I&#39;d like to hear from everyone else who does runs track. What events do you do? What are your best times? etc. I&#39;m more of a field person to be honest though. I&#39;m doing 100m sprints and hurdles, but I&#39;m trying to focus on long jump, triple jump, and pole vault this season. I can&#39;t wait until I&#39;m good at pole vault considering its one of my favorite events so far :D

So, what are you all doing on track?</description>

              <p>Bump. It’s that time of the year again yaaaaay.</p>
<p>Who’s running track this year and what events are you doing? What times are you trying to reach?</p>
<p>I’m a 400 &amp; 800 runner and I’m going for a 49 in the 400 and 2:00 in the 800. This is my Junior year</p>

<p>Sounds about D1 collegiate level if he gets down to about 70 per lap if he wants to run the 5K-10K<br>
Otherwise, he’ll need to drop to about 62.</p>

Bumping this thread with some updates to my season:</p>
<p>First of all, I’ve been practicing with the distance portion of my team, so I’ve been running quite a few 400s! Only at 1’02", but I’m happy with it. I also ran in a 4x200 relay today at the Ocean County Relays, and I ran my leg in 25 seconds, beating my previous best by a bit over two seconds, and officially being the 4th best 200 runner on my team!

<p>hahahahaha funny. Just for practice we had a 45 minute run today… you can’t call yourself distance until you’ve ran at least a 1600 in a race, and a true distance person has done at least one 2 mile. It’s a hell of a run.[/quote]</p>
<p>this, I hate the 2 mile. although the mile is one of my better distance races.</p>

              <p>Track season is back and I am running well. Placed 23rd out of 95 collegiate athletes in the ACC conference (my university is in the BSC) in my 800m. Ran my official personal record (on paper) at a 1:58.06. Senior year I ran at State with a 1:58.32-4 (I can’t remember exactly). I almost beat one of my seniors (he’s a junior atm). He placed 22nd with a 1:57.92.</p>
<p>Also, I ran my PR (on paper) for the 5k with a 18:02 a few months ago. I can probably easily run a sub/mid-17 now.</p>

              <p>Cross country is amazing and by far my favorite sport. The distance is long enough to where you don’t have to completely destroy your body going out, however fast enough to where, if you’re good, you can be done in what seems like no time. It also attracts a weird group of people (of which I fit greatly into), which allows for fun to. The meets are MUCH better, as they’ll last 2 hours max, while your typical track meet can be anywhere from 3-9 hours, even more. The training is easier to, as you’ll find that you’re mostly doing nice, long runs (45-60 mins), as apposed to track workouts. The season is also better because, while it may start a bit hot, it will cool out by the end of the season. I mostly use track to get in shape for cross country. Also, during the day, make sure you drink a lot of water. A rule of thumb is to take your weight, divide it by two, then drink that quantity in oz.</p>

              <p>[quote=“rip4d, post:1, topic:385491”]Well considering I’ve seen a ton of posts involving track, track practice, etc, I’d like to hear from everyone else who does runs track. What events do you do? What are your best times? etc. I’m more of a field person to be honest though. I’m doing 100m sprints and hurdles, but I’m trying to focus on long jump, triple jump, and pole vault this season. I can’t wait until I’m good at pole vault considering its one of my favorite events so far <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>So, what are you all doing on track?[/quote]<br>
I used to run everyday.<br>
But that was in middle school last year.<br>
Now I don’t have to run to the busstop LO0L.<br>
Anyways. I am also very interested in track, i’m just not in shape for it anymore ;-;<br>
Good luck track ;D</p>

I did decent this year. Greatly improved my pole vaulting - went from 8 feet in the beginning of the season to nearly 11 feet.

<p>In the open 400M, my time is 54.07. However my split time for the 4x400 is generally around 53.2 or a bit lower. I haven’t hit 52 yet. My second race is always better.

Second Leg - 2:02. Expected a 2:09 from him, we move up to first place.<br>

<p>How did the season go for you guys? This year, I made it to Sectionals in the 400M Dash, and probably would have in the 200M Dash as well if my coach would have put me in it (but then again it’s probably good she didn’t, I’d be exhausted). We were regional champs in the 4x400 Relay and will also be heading over to State in a week for it after placing 4th (we missed 3rd by like half a second) at Sectionals! :)[/quote]</p>

<p>I’d say overall it was a good year for me, because I’m among the top of all freshman, and usually beat a lot of sophomores, but as a team, this season sucked.</p>
