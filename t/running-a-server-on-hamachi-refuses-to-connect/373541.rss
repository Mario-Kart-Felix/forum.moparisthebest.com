    <title>Running a server on hamachi... refuses to connect</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/running-a-server-on-hamachi-refuses-to-connect/373541</link>
    <description>For all you &quot;use the search button&quot; fanatics, I searched for similar topics and read through the whole port forwarding guide page that included setting up hamachi, but as I expected it did not include my problem, which is:
I use to run my server off hamachi since my normal computer ip randomly stopped working one day. It ran fine, no issues ever. I come back after a while only to find I set up my server the same way, but even on my own computer, I can&#39;t connect to my server using the hamachi ip when I created the network and I am in the network. (Let alone my friends being able to join either). Has anyone else been through this problem? I honestly don&#39;t see why it&#39;s an issue.
Firewalls are off, hamachi has all the connections it needs to make. It is the latest version of hamachi.</description>

<p>But yes Please Avoid Hamachi only time i ever use it is for Vista Computers so they can connect on a network for Network games or Over like Dungeon Siege Or Starcraft 1 Older games so we can play over the internet with a Network type of Connection</p>
