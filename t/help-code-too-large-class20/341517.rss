[size=15pt][b]Code Too Large[/b][/size]

This error is popping up more and more, and many people dont know why this happens. In a Jave method, its size cannot exceed 64KB. Why? Google it. What to do when this occurs? Well, you can split the one method into two parts. Say you have a method called parseIncomingPackets() (this is a RSPS reference) and it exceeded 64KB. A simple way to rid of this error would be to split it into two parts by creating a nother method such as parseIncomingPackets2(). Here is an example,
[code=java]public void parseIncomingPackets() {
   // 64KB, compiler gives an error
}[/code]Split up,
[code=java]public void parseIncomingPackets() {
   // below 64KB, no error
}

public void parseIncomingPackets2() {
   // below 64KB, no error
}
[/code]Also, be noted you have to call the second method at one point probably like,
[code=java]public void parseIncomingPackets() {
   // your code here
   parseIncomingPackets2();
}[/code]</description>
