    <title>Template For Asking Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/template-for-asking-questions/36922</link>
    <description>This is the new template for the help section. You [b][u]MUST[/b] use this template if you would like an answer to your problem. Also, if you do not use this template, your thread will be locked. This template is being put into effect to keep the Development/Help Section more organized. Lately, it has been very unorganized so I have put into effect a template. This is only to help out the people that need help. If you use this template, people can understand your problem and be able to help you easier without asking you to elaborate or explain more.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[b]Type:[/b] [i]What is the type of problem. Is it an error, question, or help for a server?[/i]

[b]Server Base:[/b] [i]What is the server base of your source?[/i]

[b]Problem:[/b] [i]State your problem here.[/i]

[b]Picture:[/b] [i]Post a picture of the error if the problem contains an error.[/i]

[b]Type of server:[/b] [i]Is the server Hamachi or No-Ip?[/i]

[b]Additional Info[/b] [i]Put any additional information that might help fix the problem.[/i]
