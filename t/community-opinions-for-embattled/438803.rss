    <title>Community Opinions for Embattled</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/community-opinions-for-embattled/438803</link>
    <description>Hey guys. I&#39;m currently working on the development of a private server called Embattled (check it out in development section). The main characteristic of Embattled is its unique gameplay features and ideas.

This leads to the very reason for making this topic. In an attempt to extend the originality of Embattled further than it is already, new interfaces are being made for the features  being added, example lockpicking. Many have already acknowledged the current level of originality of Embattled, however it is my intention to take it to the next level. This includes completely new skills, and remakes of existing skills. These will be elaborated on further in the topic. The reactions from friends has been varied, so I&#39;d like a general community opinion on regards to the features I am going to add. So please read on and post your honest opinions.

Please  note: These features will require their own item and object models, however if they don&#39;t look exceptional they will not be added. So please avoid posts such as, if you can get the models right it will  be good. I know this. The skills are as follows.

Mining
Description: Ability to gather ore and gems from respective rocks.
Features: -There will only be one type of picaxe, however it will degrade over time. 
-Instead of walking into an area and there being many rocks, mining deposits will be spread throughout the map. Higher rocks being in higher level areas.
-The types of rocks will be different to Runescape.

Skinning
Description: Gathering resources from animals such as rats, bears, scorpions, wolves.
Features: -Every animal will drop a carcass, which if activated will add items that correspond to that animal. Example wolf pelt, bones, wolf fang. Whether you can skin the carcass for its items depends on skinning level.

Herblore
Description: Ability to gather herbs from plant objects.
Features: -Similar to mining skill.

Fishing
Description: gathering fish from fishing spots.
Features: -similar to existing fishing. 

Woodcutting
Description: Gathering wood from trees.
Features: -Similar to existing.

Smithing
Description: Creating bars, armour, weapons and jewellery from ores.
Features:-Similar to existing.

Crafting
Description: Creating light armour from animal pelts, bows from wood, etc.
Features:-New armour will be integrated for rangers, wolf armour, bear armour, leather. 

Alchemy
Description: Creating potions from carcass items and herblore items.
Features: -All potions will be one dose. New potions will be integrated.
-Players will use alchemy labs to create potions.

Cooking
Description: Cooking raw items.
Features: -Similar to existing cooking.

Enchanting
-Description: Ability to enchant basic armour pieces and weapons to add bonuses.
Features: -Enchanted armour will look slightly different to its base armour. For example guthix, zamorak, are based off rune armour. Likewise with weapons.
-Soul ingots are used to enchant items.

All skills will have different interfaces and models.
[end of skills]


Features

Collecting Souls: All enemies that are killed will release souls. To collect souls you must be wearing a high enough level ring. An emerald ring is the first level ring, it allows players to collect souls from level 20 monsters and below. Sapphire rings allow players to collect souls from monsters level 40 and below. Etc. Higher level enemies release more souls. A soul container must also be present to collect souls. Souls are then morphed into soul ingots. Which can be traded. Ingots are used for enchanting and magic as a replacement for runes.

[end of features]


This is all completely programmable. I have already began on handlers for these skills. I&#39;m just waiting on models and interfaces by developers.

I was just wondering what you guys think about these ideas and features in a private server? Is it time for a change? Do players only want to play generic runescape server? Would it be popular? 

All comments are appreciated. Keep it friendly but honest.

Thank you. All comments are appreciated. :)</description>
