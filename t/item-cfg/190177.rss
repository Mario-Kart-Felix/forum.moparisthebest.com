    <description>Does anyone have a full list of items both normal and silab items together? I just need the ids and descriptions put in so I can custom the prices. If anyone has a full list in order, I would love to help add runescape prices to it and reupload it for others to use. :] (currently in the process of working on the first half of normal moparscape item list the first 5k items out of 15,489 items total)

Please post your item .cfg if it just has the names, ids, and descriptions! Thanks! :cool:[br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 16, 2008, 10:57:27 PM[/size][hr]Anyone have a complete silabs item.cfg (id&#39;s 11805 - 15489? already coded with prices and all?)</description>
