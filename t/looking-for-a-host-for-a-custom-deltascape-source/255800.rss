    <title>Looking for a host for a custom deltascape source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-host-for-a-custom-deltascape-source/255800</link>
    <description>I have been working on deltascape source for around 2 weeks. I have fixed all the bugs, changed barrows, added alot of new training area&#39;s and fixed pc, added pc rewards. Added a giant mole mini game etc. Custom home, custom shops. 

My friend was hosting it for a while but he moved house and his internet won&#39;t be on for a couple weeks so i&#39;m looking for a new host.

- Must host atleast 23 hours a day.
- Must have portfowarded, or connect to the net without a router or wireless internet.</description>
