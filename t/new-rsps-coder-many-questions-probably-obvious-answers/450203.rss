    <title>New RSPS coder. Many questions. Probably obvious answers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-rsps-coder-many-questions-probably-obvious-answers/450203</link>
    <description>Hello!

I&#39;m just starting to do coding for java and RSPSs, i know next to nil. But am expiramenting. I&#39;m using Project Insanity to base my server off, and i forget the client name, but it went with it. I got my game up and working, but there are a few things i want to start with.

1. What are some easy things i should look into to start off, i still need to make sure my server runes on my no-ip and need help setting up that. But after that where should i start? What are basic things i should know/learn and go over first?
2. I am aiming/wanting to add Dclaws with a fully functional 4x spec attack with animations. Is this hard or easy, and how would i go about doing that.
3. I edited my character file to be 99 in every skill. When i talk to the wise old man (skillcape store) i can see all of them and value and attempt to buy them. as long as i have no cash in my inventory. now when i talk to him with cash in my inventory. My client freezes. How do I fix this?

if anyone can tell me how, or point me to tutorials on how that would be great thanks :D</description>

<p>I believe the problem is with one of the capes, I’m not sure which one. I don’t and will never use Project Insanity.</p>
<p>What base should you use? If you want to learn Java use one of these:</p>
<blockquote>Shard Revolution
Hyperion
RuneSource</blockquote>
<p>If you want to get an easy idea of how simple Java works, use something like DeltaScape. Something that isn’t packaged is probably ideal for your first base.</p>

<li>I wouldn’t go with P.I. as a first base choice.</li>
<li>Go to the Server Help section and follow the tutorial named “How to Setup a Server”.</li>
<li>There are multiple tutorials on how to add Dragon Claws, use the Search feature and Google.</li>
<li>That sounds like the Skillcape shop glitch a few people were having trouble with a while back in P.I.</li>
