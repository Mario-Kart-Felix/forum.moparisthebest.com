    <description>Hey, I&#39;m not sure what this is anti-leech or I&#39;m just screwing something up but okay so here it goes, every time I download a source and test login it works right? Then as soon as I go in the Jframe and change the name of the client and the options it won&#39;t let me connect anymore? I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m doing wrong.. If you know what is wrong please tell me. Thank you.</description>
