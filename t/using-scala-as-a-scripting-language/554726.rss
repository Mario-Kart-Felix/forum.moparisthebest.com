    <description>is there any way to use this script

[code=scala]import java.util.Optional

    npc
  }

    var i = array.length - 1
    while (i &gt; 0) {
      val index = rand.nextInt(i + 1)
      val a = array(index)
      array(index) = array(i)
      array(i) = a
      i -= 1
      i + 1
    }
    array
  }
  def randElement = array((rand.nextDouble * array.length).toInt)
}

implicit class SeqImplicits[T](seq: Seq[T]) {
  def shuffle = util.Random.shuffle(seq)
  def randElement = seq((rand.nextDouble * seq.length).toInt)
}[/code]

as a dependency for all other scripts? so I can evaluate other simple scripts like this

[code=scala]import io.luna.game.event.impl.LoginEvent

on[LoginEvent] { (msg, plr) =&gt;
  plr.setRights(if (plr.address.equals(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;)) rightsDev else plr.getRights)

  plr.sendMessage(&quot;Welcome to Luna, a #317 Runescape emulator!&quot;)

  if (plr.attr(&quot;first_login&quot;)) {
    plr.sendMessage(&quot;blah blah blah blah&quot;)
    plr.attr(&quot;first_login&quot;, false)
  }
}[/code]

does anyone know how I&#39;d go about doing this? i&#39;ve been playing around with it but can&#39;t really come up with an elegant solution. thanks!</description>

<p>I used Dr. Racket and I really spent more time trying to count parenthesis than necessary.

<p>although i actually agree with you on that it’s more difficult to produce larger programs, especially if you don’t think through the design well in the beginning. to me at least, lisp is just as big of a write-only language as C is – i can only read my own code, and not anybody else’s. it’s not the parens per se that make this problematic for me (or anybody, really), but rather the general lisp programming style: s-exps in a fp paradigm that, combined, make this hard for me. i know many seasoned lisp coders don’t have a problem with it anymore though; perhaps it just takes a lot of time. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> sometimes you have to read inside-out (i.e. start reading the deepest nested expressions first). i don’t see how implementing a sort or binary search would be a problem though. keep in mind if you aren’t thinking recursively you <em>will</em> have a worse time.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I mean I can think recursively. That was the only way to get through that class. I guess looking at C-syntax code is so much more intuitive to me.</p>
<p>I’m sure there’s probably more at fault with me if so many people are successful with it but tbh just looking back at my lab I struggle to see how people can get into the groove of making large code bases. I spent more time just trying to understand what was happening than actually doing anything. Here’s a lab sample I had to do in that class:</p>
          <a href="http://i.imgur.com/c6Ps5a5.png" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">
            <img src="http://i.imgur.com/c6Ps5a5.png" width="564" height="499">
          </a>

<p>But that could just be me and maybe that’s intuitive to you guys. Anyway thanks for the feedback.[/quote]</p>
<p><a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su10/resources/sp11-Jordy/vector-vs-list.html" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su10/resources/sp11-Jordy/vector-vs-list.html</a></p>
<p>but yeah, sometimes writing imperative code will be far more practical. that’s why most lisps are multi-paradigmal, so you can do what you actually need to do. in reality you can’t be completely pure without sacrificing something, especially when you are dealing with states that are constantly changing (like i/o). i mean haskell has a bunch of solutions to that, but meh, it’s fuken haskell. fp is just an ideal; if something can be done well without modifying state, then nice.</p>
<p>most editors in general are not suitable for editing lisp code. coloring parens and correct spacing make things much more readable.</p>
<p>car and cdr are historical names, and brevity was important back then.</p>
<p>fp emphasizes functions, where each function should be relatively small with one specific purpose. of course this can’t always be done perfectly but in general if you split up your functions things will be easier to comprehend.</p>

<p>it’s not bad for small functions but trying to make something actually productive and readable in that language is a fallacy to me. you have to use a new set of parenthesis just to declare variables and the deeper you go the harder it becomes for another person to even grasp what is happening. I also think having to iterate a list just to reach an element in question instead of just directly accessing it is mindblowingly inefficient when you think about every list an application would use. granted you probably shouldn’t be using a list if you need to directly access certain members, but consider how horribly inefficient a list/merge sort would be. you can’t even do a binary search with that kind of limitation. I’m sure the code looks pretty but that doesn’t mean much when it’s marginally slower. maybe it’s just my imagination and the implementation isn’t so bad, but it’s definitely not something I’d want to do in scheme.</p>

You never modify data in-place (ie. set!), it’s just not the functional way. Binary searches are very possible here.</p>
<p>To be honest, alot of these problems stem from not fully understanding the functional paradigm and Scheme. Not trying to be a dick; just my two cents.</p>

              <p>I had an assignment to fix my professor’s broken math expression calculator that involved recursively digging into user-input parenthetical statements and holding values on recursive function calls down the stack and back up. in any ordinary language it would be trivial to figure out what you were looking at but with the godawful syntax (((((((()()))(()))()()))))) and names (seriously, set!, car, cdr?) I spent way too many hours just trying to figure out what abomination I was even looking at before I even began coding the solution.</p>
<p>it’s not bad for small functions but trying to make something actually productive and readable in that language is a fallacy to me. you have to use a new set of parenthesis just to declare variables and the deeper you go the harder it becomes for another person to even grasp what is happening. I also think having to iterate a list just to reach an element in question instead of just directly accessing it is mindblowingly inefficient when you think about every list an application would use. granted you probably shouldn’t be using a list if you need to directly access certain members, but consider how horribly inefficient a list/merge sort would be. you can’t even do a binary search with that kind of limitation. I’m sure the code looks pretty but that doesn’t mean much when it’s marginally slower. maybe it’s just my imagination and the implementation isn’t so bad, but it’s definitely not something I’d want to do in scheme.</p>

<p>because the plugin system is based on event listeners, the scripts are only evaluated once on startup. so what I did was just evaluate the bootstrap (the first block of code in OP) -&gt; script dependencies -&gt; misc. scripts (second code block in OP would fall under this) in that order</p>
<p>i had to define a file that specifically declares what order the “script dependencies” should be evaluated in, to ensure that a script dependency that depends on another script dependency is evaluated after what it depends on</p>
<p>this also means that circular script dependencies won’t work, but there’s ways around that so I don’t think it’ll be an issue</p>

I don’t see your problem. You import the first file into the second, and then you can use it?<br>
[/quote]<br>
my problem is that i have multiple scripts just like the second, i need the first script to have “global” state</p>
<p>edit: i got it working, thanks anyway[/quote]<br>
What did you do to fix it?</p>

<p>Are you using scala for a scripting language for a RuneScape server? Interesting</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>yeah! originally I was compiling the Scala code into bytecode and using DelayedInit to create a function that wraps around the initialization code, so all I had to do was instantiate the classes on startup and add the wrapped function to a map as a listener (with the event class type as the key)</p>
<p>but this proved not to be sufficient enough because it was still too verbose (a top level class was required for it to work, annoying) plus DelayedInit is deprecated and will probably be removed soon so now I’m just using Scala as a scripting language. its nice because I have a lot more control over exactly how I want it to be</p>
