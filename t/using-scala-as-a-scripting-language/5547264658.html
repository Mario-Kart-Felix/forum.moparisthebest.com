</aside>
<p>I don’t know what you mean here. In FP, the idea is not to mutate your data but instead to use that as an input to a function to compute whatever you need to do, then return its transformation. You never modify data in-place (ie. set!), it’s just not the functional way. Binary searches are very possible here.</p>
<p>To be honest, alot of these problems stem from not fully understanding the functional paradigm and Scheme. Not trying to be a dick; just my two cents.</p>

<p>if the bane of lisp programming was dealing with parentheses for you then you probably just had a shitty text editor that couldn’t deal with them (hint: that also includes vim). scheme’s (and racket’s) functions are actually named fairly reasonably. if you take a look at common lisp, THEN you should have a fun time. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>although i actually agree with you on that it’s more difficult to produce larger programs, especially if you don’t think through the design well in the beginning. to me at least, lisp is just as big of a write-only language as C is – i can only read my own code, and not anybody else’s. it’s not the parens per se that make this problematic for me (or anybody, really), but rather the general lisp programming style: s-exps in a fp paradigm that, combined, make this hard for me. i know many seasoned lisp coders don’t have a problem with it anymore though; perhaps it just takes a lot of time. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> sometimes you have to read inside-out (i.e. start reading the deepest nested expressions first). i don’t see how implementing a sort or binary search would be a problem though. keep in mind if you aren’t thinking recursively you <em>will</em> have a worse time.</p>

in any ordinary language it would be trivial to figure out what you were looking at but with the godawful syntax (((((((()()))(()))()()))))) and names (seriously, set!, car, cdr?)

The program was already using that in the state it was given to me. I do FP in javascript anyway.

I also think having to iterate a list just to reach an element in question instead of just directly accessing it is mindblowingly inefficient when you think about every list an application would use.

Scheme has vectors.</blockquote>
I have to ask what is the point of lists then? I'll take the blame and say it's my fault I wasn't made aware of it nor the rest of my class...
<blockquote>[quote author=Death Style link=topic=673647.msg4504771#msg4504771 date=1456099217]
but consider how horribly inefficient a list/merge sort would be. you can't even do a binary search with that kind of limitation.
[/quote]
I don't know what you mean here. In FP, the idea is not to mutate your data but instead to use that as an input to a function to compute whatever you need to do, then return its transformation. You never modify data in-place (ie. set!), it's just not the functional way. Binary searches are very possible here.</blockquote>
Well I use .map in js so I'm aware of the idea behind it. Just with my understanding that a list was the only native collection type doing such tasks would be awful. I'm not even sure how you would do a binary search with a list since it can only be traversed in one direction; you would use a vector. And even if it's against the "FP" practice of modifying data I would rather modify a 1 million collection to be in the correct order than load into memory another 1 million collection that is the sorted version.
<blockquote>To be honest, alot of these problems stem from not fully understanding the functional paradigm and Scheme. Not trying to be a dick; just my two cents.</blockquote>
I do FP in JS and most of my problems are with the syntax, choice of names for basic operations, and my belief that a one-direction list was the only way to store things. No excuse for my ignorance though so I'll accept that.
<p>I mean, I probably just had a shitty class on it. Vectors seem like a pretty significant thing and that was never brought up in class. Not trying to toot my horn or anything but I was rank 1 in my uni class that went over scheme so I figured if I was having problems after landing perfect scores on the tests and homework there wasn’t much to excuse the shortcomings I had with it.</p>

I mean I can think recursively. That was the only way to get through that class. I guess looking at C-syntax code is so much more intuitive to me.
<p>I’m sure there’s probably more at fault with me if so many people are successful with it but tbh just looking back at my lab I struggle to see how people can get into the groove of making large code bases. I spent more time just trying to understand what was happening than actually doing anything. Here’s a lab sample I had to do in that class:</p>

<p>but yeah, sometimes writing imperative code will be far more practical. that’s why most lisps are multi-paradigmal, so you can do what you actually need to do. in reality you can’t be completely pure without sacrificing something, especially when you are dealing with states that are constantly changing (like i/o). i mean haskell has a bunch of solutions to that, but meh, it’s fuken haskell. fp is just an ideal; if something can be done well without modifying state, then nice.</p>
<p>most editors in general are not suitable for editing lisp code. coloring parens and correct spacing make things much more readable.</p>
<p>car and cdr are historical names, and brevity was important back then.</p>
<p>fp emphasizes functions, where each function should be relatively small with one specific purpose. of course this can’t always be done perfectly but in general if you split up your functions things will be easier to comprehend.</p>
