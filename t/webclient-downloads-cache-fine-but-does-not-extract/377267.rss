    <title>Webclient - Downloads cache fine but does not extract?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-downloads-cache-fine-but-does-not-extract/377267</link>
    <description>Hey, Ive followed all the webclient tutorials and every single one brings me to this error:

Connection error - Retrying in 5 seconds.....

Ok so I looked into it and I relized that the cache.zip gets downloaded fine (Thank you fileden free hosting is ftw) but it never gets to &quot;unpack&quot; the zip. 

Yet if I were to do it manually by going into my C:/SERVER.CACHE/cache.zip and extract it in the same folder, the webclient works fine.

So in conlcusion I have no Idea why it wont unpack.
I have blurrr.java and gui.java that are untouched throughout every tutorial which could mabye be a problem.  If anyone knows the answer and is willing to help me out...
