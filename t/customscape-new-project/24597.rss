    <description>Hello everyone who reads my thread,
I need 2 coders to accompany me making a new server based on cheez 78 source.
I already have complete canoes and stuff, and im on the way to developing more.

Goals:
Make a more realistic server
Keep the server up-to-date
Make every skill work. 
Make people have fun
Making an easy-to-modify source, so people can use this very easily ;)
