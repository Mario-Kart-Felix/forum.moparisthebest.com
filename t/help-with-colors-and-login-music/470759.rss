    <title>Help with colors and login music?</title>

    <description>Hello Moparscape!

I was wondering if somebody could help me with 2 problems while trying to fix up this Source and Client that is based on Rs317.

This is my first problem, when logging in the colors don&#39;t display and just give me codes:

My second problem is when on the login screen I don&#39;t hear the music? This is included in the Cache but it isn&#39;t playing.
