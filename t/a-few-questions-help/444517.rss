    <description>Hey,

I&#39;m running a 667-704 server and iv&#39;e been searching on here on how to make a shop now i know you guys might say that there are a lot of tutorial&#39;s and i did follow a lot of them related to my revision but when i create the shop and i click on the npc controlling the shop the shop just won&#39;t open... can anyone help? or tell me what i&#39;m doing wrong.


Another thing is can anyone give me a code for a donator zone for this revision (667-704) thanks guys that&#39;s all for now sorry if this is a noobie question but i&#39;m pretty new to coding at the moment but i know some stuff (Making myself owner, welcome message, starter kits, coding teleports etc....) and if it&#39;s not to hard to ask how could i get just one altar that give&#39;s the option to change through all spellbook&#39;s and all prayer spell books. Thanks peace guys!</description>
