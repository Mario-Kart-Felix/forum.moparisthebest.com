I honestly built this server just to have a good time playing with some friends before we actually started to build a decent player base. I know it is far from perfect but a lot of time and effort has gone into this server and it would really mean a lot if you could show some support :)</description>

<p>Ya for the homepage (since I am not too good at website development) I decided to go for something simple that looks nice and gets the job done(same with the forums). Still looking for a decent website developer that can help me with that kind of stuff. The main reason for the barrows shop was for pkers and for people that wanted to sell barrows items they did not want. With a smaller player base it can be a pain to have to worry about buying certain items from players. I will probably remove as the player base grows to get the economy going. I really appreciate your feedback <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
