              <p>Oh, that first one may have been me as well, I don’t even remember. I think you made a thread about ddosing someone because they were ddosing you or something. Either way, that’s expired, and the other one was fixed.</p>
<p>EDIT - <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,513263.0.html">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,513263.0.html</a> Yes that was from me, and it was for like a week or something.</p>

So you were banned for some misunderstanding, then unbanned today?<br>
Ye me too. Banned for ‘ddosing’ when <span class="bbcode-i">I</span> was the one getting ddosed, nor do I own any type of hacking material…<br>
Ah well, might as well post it up before I get banned again D:<br>
[/quote]If I remember correctly, I received a PM saying you had been hacked (which a quick IP check and viewing of posts confirmed). I banned an IP that you were logged in from (or the hacker was logged in from, I should say) until you could recover your account. I don’t know why it would say ‘ddosing’, unless this is a different incident you are talking about…[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s the one that said (all from memory):<br>
“Sorry Fridder, you’ve been banned from this forum! Reason: DDoS. It’s not permanent because it was partially self-defense.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile it was meant to expire September 4th, 2011 - Then September 3rd it got changed to a permanent ban…</p>
<p>I got hacked? o.o</p>
