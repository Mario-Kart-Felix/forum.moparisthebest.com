( if you  could post a script for that and explain how to use it and how it works then id be really gratful.) ( im a newbie to SCAR scripting   :| )
Thanks for your time!

EDIT: Working on the bit of script bebo gave to start off, hoping to make shitloads of variations of this lol,( really simple as only for private servers ) :D heres the code

Thanks alot!
[code]Procedure FindAndClick;
begin
 if(FindColor(var x, y: Integer; color, xs, ys, xe, ye: Integer))then
  clickmouse(x , y , true)
end;[/code]

<p>Well since this is for a private server there is no need to script it very well for the simple fact you aren’t going to be banned for using it most likely <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Simple color clicker <span class="bbcode-b">outline</span>:</p>
<p><code>Procedure FindAndClick;
begin
 if(FindColor(var x, y: Integer; color, xs, ys, xe, ye: Integer))then
  clickmouse(x , y , true)
end;</code><br>
That should get you started. If you need further help the take a visit to the tutorial section or visit <a href="http://www.villavu.com/forum/index.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">SRL</a> (I recommend).</p>
