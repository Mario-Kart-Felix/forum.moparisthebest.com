    <title>[PI] Need help with adding in donator rank</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-need-help-with-adding-in-donator-rank/361730</link>
    <description>Is there any tutorial specifically written for PI on how to add in donator rank. I saw a few out there, but people seem to say they aren&#39;t that good or it doesn&#39;t look like it was designed for PI. If possible, both server and client side would be appreciated. Adding the status and the icon.</description>
