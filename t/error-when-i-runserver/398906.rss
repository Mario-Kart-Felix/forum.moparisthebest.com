    <title>Error when I runserver?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-when-i-runserver/398906</link>
    <description>Whenever I click the runserver.bat, it comes up with an error -
&quot;Error: Unable to start up listener on 43594 - port already in use?&quot;
I have tried restarting my router, and my computer and nothing works. I don&#39;t have anything that is runescape related at all, and this is still giving me this error. Could it be something wrong with my environment variables, or maybe a file in the source? Any help is appreciated.

              <p>Disaster, I don’t have anything torrent related running… So I’m not sure what I could close. And tillly, when I change the ports on my default gateway in my browser, what file do I look in on my source/client to change the port?</p>
<p>Also, thanks everyone for helping.</p>
<p>EDIT: Okay, I think I may have fixed this. If someone could do me a HUGE favor and try to log into the server, <a href="http://sativascape.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">sativascape.no-ip.org</a> and let me know what happens that would be great! Thank you!</p>

<p>OR !!!</p>
<p>go into your router setting and see what the port is being used for and if it is being used on somthing not useful just redo it and make it for your rsps =-)[/quote]</p>

              <p>The server is a blank dodian server that I downloaded to see if I could host my own server, before I got into learning about the basics of coding etc. So I guess what you’re saying could be whats wrong with it. But, I portforwarded, edited my environment variables, opened up the port in my firewall and downloaded no-ip. If this were the reason I couldn’t be running it, then wouldn’t anyone who leeched a server, not be able to run it?..</p>
<p>And, tinyscape, I have restarted my computer many times. And no I do not have bittorrent.</p>

<p>Restart your computer to kill off the process which is using port 43594.<br>
If this still doesn’t work, Check Bittorrent (If you have it) to see if it’s using that port.</p>

              <p>open task manager and check for “java.exe” if any programs are running under that name close it, and try to run your server, other then that all i can say is make sure you dont have another run program open which it appears not to be. Also make sure your run is set to this</p>
<p><code>@echo off
color 0a
title YOURNAMEHERE
java -Xmx512m -cp .;./jython.jar;./MySql/mysql-connector-java-3.0.08-ga-bin.jar server</code></p>
<p>Depending on the source that should work for delta, allstar, ect; If your using dspk theres a memoryleak.bat you should try; Hope i helped as i really cant expand much on this as i haven’t seen this problem before.</p>
