    <title>I think I&#39;ve been banned by mistake...again</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-think-ive-been-banned-by-mistake-again/29673</link>
    <description>When I try and log on with &#39;Akriam&#39; it says I have been banned for spamming. Which doesn&#39;t make sence because I was not spamming :confused: This happened before when I was accidently banned for posting a trogan. Maybe someone is using my IP address as a proxy or something because sometimes when I go to rapidshare I get that message about how I can&#39;t download something becuase my IP is in the process of downloading something when in reality I havn&#39;t been to that sight in weeks :) Well, if by some chance this is not a mistake...erm...sorry? But really, if it isn&#39;t a mistake, how have I spammed, I looked at my previous posts and while they are not extremely useful they are not like making three topics that all say &quot;G1vE m3 D4 Mop4Scap3 H4aks!&quot;... so...ya :)</description>

              <p>Yeah when I try to login from my cottage it says I’m banned from posting trojans. The first time I thought that I really was banned and I was wondering if someone got into my account or something… But then it worked when I came back home.</p>

<p>I really don’t know then.</p>
<p>It might be a temporary ban, so just use this for now, I guess.</p>

              <p>When I try and log on with ‘Akriam’ it says I have been banned for spamming.

Maybe someone is using my IP address as a proxy or something because sometimes when I go to rapidshare I get that message about how I can’t download something becuase my IP is in the process of downloading something when in reality I havn’t been to that sight in weeks <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Well, if by some chance this is not a mistake…erm…sorry? But really, if it isn’t a mistake, how have I spammed, I looked at my previous posts and while they are not extremely useful they are not like making three topics that all say “G1vE m3 D4 Mop4Scap3 H4aks!”… so…ya <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
