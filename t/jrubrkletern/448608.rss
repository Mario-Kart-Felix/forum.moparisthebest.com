Found wooden planks under shallow water, dug into it to see what I could find.  As it turns out, it goes directly to a stronghold.  Don&#39;t try saying you got the coords from somebody and dug straight down; everyone uses that excuse.

<p>This is basically what I did. I died at a spawner. knowing the coords, i simply dug straight down to it to get my items. Then, herobrine reports me to tom and leaves a sign on my property saying “I have proof you xray”.</p>
<p>also herobrine, ever heard of minimap with wp’s? you should look into that, snitch.[/quote]The thing is, there isn’t any caves around the spawner I found that you ‘got the coords and dug into’.  Yes, I know what a world map is, but the thing I don’t understand is, how is reporting rule breakers ‘snitching’.  If anything, I should be thanked for caring about people breaking rules on the server.  And IIRC, on the old map, you had stacks and stacks of diamond blocks, you just don’t come across those easily.  I have nothing against you nor jrub.  You were somewhat of a friend at one point, and so was jrub.  Honestly, I’d report my best friend if he was breaking the rules.</p>

It may not be good, solid evidence that there is xraying going on here.  But it is quite sketchy, you never know what the possibilities could be when you find a tunnel straight down into a stronghold.  I thought it was fishy, so I reported it.  I’m so sorry I wasted all the staff’s time with a report that contains possible evidence of Xraying.</p>

Why does it seem like you’re out to get people lately Travas lol<br>
[/quote]Not out to get anyone, I knew someone would say that, I just want everyone to follow the rules so I report accordingly no matter who it is.</p>

EDIT</p>
<p>Turns out zaz says HE dug the hole, and he already knew, because he is with us, no excuse to use, because we already knew it was there.<br>
[/quote]It says you dug it.</p>
<p>[quote author=asshole_rule link=topic=551507.msg4041108#msg4041108 date=1341636254]<br>
what were you doing there anyways??<br>
[/quote]Searching the nearby area because I found places on the map (ever since the map reset I have not built a home, I have just wandered place to place) when I came across a large island and a smaller island.  I left the big island because of the smaller island (looked like a cool place to build a small little hut)  Decided not to build, I headed off the island into a new direction when I came across planks in the water where there should be sand.  Removed the planks and there was a long tunnel straight down.  For some reason the planks did not show up on core inspect, so I blocked the area off from water and I inspected further down, and saw drub’s name removing smooth stone.  Why does zaz say he dug it when it shows jrub’s name removing stone?  Obviously someone is lying here?[/quote]<br>
According to zaz, I had covered it up, but he mined it, i never mined it like that, even if i did, it doesnt matter because, i already knew where it was and had it waypointed on my minimap, so this report is useless.</p>

<p>[quote=“asshole_rule, post:5, topic:448608”]what were you doing there anyways??[/quote]Searching the nearby area because I found places on the map (ever since the map reset I have not built a home, I have just wandered place to place) when I came across a large island and a smaller island.  I left the big island because of the smaller island (looked like a cool place to build a small little hut)  Decided not to build, I headed off the island into a new direction when I came across planks in the water where there should be sand.  Removed the planks and there was a long tunnel straight down.  For some reason the planks did not show up on core inspect, so I blocked the area off from water and I inspected further down, and saw drub’s name removing smooth stone.  Why does zaz say he dug it when it shows jrub’s name removing stone?  Obviously someone is lying here?</p>

<p>Actually, relm found it, this was after I found it, I bookmarked it to go mine some of the stones inside, any more questions</p>

              <p>Actually, I put the wooden planks there first because I saw cobble there I dug the hole. Secondly they have a underground tunnel leading to the portal room from the island. Third Relm found it not jrub he found it when doing a strip mine iirc.</p>
