    <title>Help me improve my code?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-me-improve-my-code/555354</link>
    <description>Well my title seems vague. But, I realized that I have an MoparScape account for +4 years, and decided to be active on the community. Finally decided to learn Java, during my life crisis in trying to do something with my life.

Issue #1: Panel arrangement
I created a program, and there are minor issues with how the FlowLayout() is trying to do it&#39;s job but is not working out too well. Not sure if is something to do with how I setup my panels, or I am just being stupid.

Here is the image, as you can see the JLabel() Setting and Frequency is like together... Not sure if I should add each of them on a different panels. All the Panels are being handled within different methods.

Issue #2: Creating a dynamic JLabel()?
Well, As you can see I have a custom range which user can enter through JTextField(). However my algorithm only does up to 1-10. How would I achieve, in a way that it does not take too much space? I was thinking to set a limit where user can only input from 1-100. So when the program runs, it will only &quot;show&quot; that specific range?

And here is the current algorithm, which uses for enhanced loops which can be found at my source code, GraphicalInterface.java
[code=java]	private void frequencyMethod() {
		//Issue #1: labelFrequency is being floated to the left with labelSetting
		mainPanel.add(labelFrequency);
		int counter = 0;
		
		for (JLabel label : frequencyLabel) {
			frequencyLabel[counter] = new JLabel(Integer.toString(counter+1));
			frequencyStatsLabel[counter] = new JLabel(&quot;0%&quot;);
			panelFrequency.add(frequencyLabel[counter]);
			panelFrequency.add(frequencyStatsLabel[counter]);
			counter += 1;
		}
	}[/code]

Anyways here is the source code:

<p>Issue <span class="hashtag">#1:</span><br>
I have a couple thoughts on this first if you are designing a Gui why not use a Gui designer? :S<br>
It would help you greatly you could simply use a null layout and drag and drop and see in real time exactly where your components go and what its going to look like<br>
also generated code and less mistakes will save you loads of time…</p>
<p>Issue <span class="hashtag">#2:</span><br>
You can only do 10 because you only have space allocated for 10 frequency lables however you could convert back to a normal for loop and do something a bit like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">for(int i=0; i &lt; getCount(); i++) {

}

private int getCount() {
     return (recursionCount &gt; 0 ? recursionCount : frequencyLabel.length);
}</code></pre>
