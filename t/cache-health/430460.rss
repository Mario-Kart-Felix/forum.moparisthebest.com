    <title>Cache health</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cache-health/430460</link>
    <description>Does anyone know if there is any reason for the non-contingency of the files in the cache? I&#39;m making a cache editor, and was thinking of adding a diagnostic utility with it, and was wondering if making the existing data contingent would &quot;damage&quot; the cache.

The main reason that I could think of for non-contingency is the ability to add more data, or edit existing data, without having to essentially rewrite the entire cache.</description>
