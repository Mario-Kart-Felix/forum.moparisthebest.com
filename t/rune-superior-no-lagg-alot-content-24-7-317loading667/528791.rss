[FONT=Comic Sans MS][SIZE=5]  Introduction[/SIZE][/FONT]

The majority of Rune-Superior evolves around an economy gameplay, but we&#39;ve worked around that and also made it a Pking like server experience with our pvp toggles. We replaced the world map with a button that lets you toggle on pvp and whomever else has this on will be able to attack you, so beware! Having pvp mode on also grants you more experiences during skilling and combat training and we&#39;ve also built in a pvp drop system in which corrupt armors and brawling gloves are dropped!

We&#39;ve tried our best to revamp as many npcs as we can and revamp their drops to have more of an enjoyable economy.

We welcome everyone who&#39;s looking for a new RSPS to join Rune-Superior, see you ingame.

[FONT=Comic Sans MS][SIZE=5]What is Rune-Superior and What is our Main Focus?[/SIZE][/FONT]
Rune-Superior is a brand new 317 RSPS that&#39;s main focus will be on Community. Here we strive to create a home for everyone and we&#39;d like Rune-Superior to be everyones final stay.

[FONT=Comic Sans MS][SIZE=5]What does Community mean to us?[/SIZE][/FONT]

Community to us means family, clan, democracy, and basically keeping the players Entertained/Happy. Here on Rune-Superior, all suggestions and decisions are brought to the players, everything said by a player is considered top priority. However, the staff are here to make the tough decisions, so dont complain if you didn&#39;t get what you wanted. We try our best to keep the all players happy. 

[FONT=Comic Sans MS][SIZE=5]Competitive[/SIZE][/FONT]

Competition? Ever played real easy Runescape Servers that got you maxed within an hour? You&#39;ll eventually get bored of it and what surprises me even more is that they have highscores on those servers. Here on Rune-Superior, we offer a low, but not too low exp rate to increase competitivity. If a games not competitive why play it? It&#39;s one of the things that made Runescape players stick around Runescape. Ofcourse this doesn&#39;t mean our xp rates are gonna be like Runescape, we know the general population who are looking into RSPS&#39;s are basically looking for a chill community and an easy way out to spending loads of hours training a skill.

</aside>
<p>in my opinion, 317 Loading higher data is pretty awsome, if you do it correctly ofcourse<br>
and i’m a bit of a noob in 500+servers, maybe i ever start a project with someone in 500+</p>
