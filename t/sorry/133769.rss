ok heres the real reason i posted this thread: my friend was starting smoking pot and i was really worried so i posted it like an ass wondering what i should do.  According to you guys, <a href="http://erowid.org" rel="nofollow noopener">erowid.org</a>, and google, my friend will be fine if he uses it safely.  BUT heres the problem, the guy who sold him got arrested for possession and rumor has it he had pcp.  I heard pcp can be laced with weed(it looked like chopped very fine).  Is my friend gonna be fucked up?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Don’t worry about your friend! It was God’s choice to allow him to use drugs. And once he starts, he’ll be in better hands. He has no control over his addiction and only God can save him.[/quote]</p>
<p>I lol’d, you really think ‘God’ (doesnt exist IMO) allowed him to?</p>

I was taught in SCHOOL that if you smoke pot then you won’t be able to have kids, and that from trying it just once will probably lead to cancer. Along with a million other completely rediculous claims.</p>
<p>That website is horribly wrong. It is not educating people about drugs, it is using out dated information that was horribly exagerated or false. It’s websites like that why I started using drugs. How about you get information that wasn’t randomly made up in the 30’s.</p>
<p>I started using pot because I found out I was lied to about it. And I will smoke all I want thank you very much. It’s a life style I chose for myself, it does not concern you in anyway. But cheers for looking out for my saftey <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I know you mean well.</p>
<p>Funny stuff on that site though. I didn’t read it all, it’s the general propaganda designed for children to scare them away instead of properly educating them to make informed descisions.</p>
<p>Hmm, so lets see if I am doing drugs:</p>
<p>-lose interest in school – Well, I have interest in school but due to circumstances I will not be attended on acount I do not know how(moved out with my brother) and also I will soon be making double the amount of money my dad makes. I was just about to graduate anyways.<br>
-change friends (to hang out with kids who use drugs) – Nope. Sure I make new friends, but I never lose them. Not to drugs anyways.<br>
-become moody, negative, cranky, or worried all the time – nope<br>
-ask to be left alone a lot – nope<br>
-have trouble concentrating – nope, I’m even sharper if anything<br>
-sleep a lot (maybe even in class)  – nope, less then average if anything<br>
-get in fights – nope<br>
-have red or puffy eyes – red when stoned…<br>
-lose or gain weight – nope, actually I’ve been the same weight for about 4-5 years now<br>
-cough a lot – no but if I feel my lungs getting sore then I quit for at least a couple weeks to a month.<br>
-have a runny nose all of the time – lol nope, I’m not a coke head.<br>
[/quote]<br>
No offense man, but IMO there are no “informed decisions” when it comes to doing something illegal.  Also, do you want to know how many people have died because of drug overdoses?  My own uncle drank until his skin was fucking yellow and then put himself into a spiral of depression and eventually death for ten years.  He lost his house, wife and kids.  My dad’s cousin lost his daugheter, wife and house and trucking business because he used amphetamine and now he’s 50 drifting in and out of jail.  He was a burnout in high school and eventually progressed to where he is now. My other uncle fried his brain using acid and now he’s about as smart as a 5-year-old.  My dad’s friend in college died after doing acid one time.  Is a 10 minute high and wasting money buying some shit that came from god knows where that has god knows what in it worth any of these scenarios or worse?  I’m not saying this to be mean to you guys who use drugs but I’ve seen the affects that drugs can have on people firsthand.  I want to help you understand that you think it’s just fun and games until something like this happens.  You might think now “oh its only pot” but eventually you’re doing worse and worse shit.  Everyone who says drugs don’t do anything bad are just lying to themselves.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well that would be your uncles fault, but just because he can’t use drugs responsibly doesn’t mean I can’t. Pot isn’t all I use of course. I enjoy many other drugs, but there are many that I swear I will never touch.</p>
<p>Most drugs I’ve done are nearly impossible to overdose on. And how people overdose anyways is beyond me. I pick a safe dose and I do it, simple as that. And I agree, 10 minute highs are no fun. Thats why I don’t do any drugs that only last 10 minutes. Well, salvia lasts 5 minutes but it most certainly feels like forever, and it’s legal and pretty damn safe to use.</p>
<p>I’ll never touch meth, or heroin, or crack, etc. Before using any new drug, I research my ass off. Literally I’ll spend days on the computer reading everything I can. Hundreds of trip reports, health effects, etc.</p>
<p>I’ve enjoyed the use of acid, Studies show that LSD doesn’t cause cancer, brain damage, or chromosome breakage. It’s also impossible to OD on. However I too can relate, my friends uncle is pretty messed up and he has a “mental” addiction to acid. Personally I’ve only used it once every 2-3 months and it’s a somewhat recent thing. Of course there are mental effects to the use, <a href="http://www.doitnow.org/pages/115.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.doitnow.org/pages/115.html</a></p>
<p>I know it seems like I talk about drugs a lot, and oh boy I must be screwed since It’s all I talk about, etc… There’s simply not a whole lot that interests me on this forum anymore so thats why I am so active in drug discussions. Generally the only thing noticable to my health is my lungs, if I’m smoking too much I just stop for a good while and I slow it down then. Which is what I am currently doing.</p>

              <p>[quote=“jme_009, post:2, topic:133769”]I was taught in SCHOOL that if you smoke pot then you won’t be able to have kids, and that from trying it just once will probably lead to cancer. Along with a million other completely rediculous claims.</p>
<p>That website is horribly wrong. It is not educating people about drugs, it is using out dated information that was horribly exagerated or false. It’s websites like that why I started using drugs. How about you get information that wasn’t randomly made up in the 30’s.</p>
<p>I started using pot because I found out I was lied to about it. And I will smoke all I want thank you very much. It’s a life style I chose for myself, it does not concern you in anyway. But cheers for looking out for my saftey <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I know you mean well.</p>
<p>Funny stuff on that site though. I didn’t read it all, it’s the general propaganda designed for children to scare them away instead of properly educating them to make informed descisions.</p>
<p>Hmm, so lets see if I am doing drugs:</p>
<p>-lose interest in school – Well, I have interest in school but due to circumstances I will not be attended on acount I do not know how(moved out with my brother) and also I will soon be making double the amount of money my dad makes. I was just about to graduate anyways.<br>
-change friends (to hang out with kids who use drugs) – Nope. Sure I make new friends, but I never lose them. Not to drugs anyways.<br>
-become moody, negative, cranky, or worried all the time – nope<br>
-ask to be left alone a lot – nope<br>
-have trouble concentrating – nope, I’m even sharper if anything<br>
-sleep a lot (maybe even in class)  – nope, less then average if anything<br>
-get in fights – nope<br>
-have red or puffy eyes – red when stoned…<br>
-lose or gain weight – nope, actually I’ve been the same weight for about 4-5 years now<br>
-cough a lot – no but if I feel my lungs getting sore then I quit for at least a couple weeks to a month.<br>
-have a runny nose all of the time – lol nope, I’m not a coke head.[/quote]<br>
No offense man, but IMO there are no “informed decisions” when it comes to doing something illegal.  Also, do you want to know how many people have died because of drug overdoses?  My own uncle drank until his skin was fucking yellow and then put himself into a spiral of depression and eventually death for ten years.  He lost his house, wife and kids.  My dad’s cousin lost his daugheter, wife and house and trucking business because he used amphetamine and now he’s 50 drifting in and out of jail.  He was a burnout in high school and eventually progressed to where he is now. My other uncle fried his brain using acid and now he’s about as smart as a 5-year-old.  My dad’s friend in college died after doing acid one time.  Is a 10 minute high and wasting money buying some shit that came from god knows where that has god knows what in it worth any of these scenarios or worse?  I’m not saying this to be mean to you guys who use drugs but I’ve seen the affects that drugs can have on people firsthand.  I want to help you understand that you think it’s just fun and games until something like this happens.  You might think now “oh its only pot” but eventually you’re doing worse and worse shit.  Everyone who says drugs don’t do anything bad are just lying to themselves.</p>

<p>A few people mentioned that weed is not addictive.  From personal experience with multiple people that I know, it most certainly IS addictive.  Maybe not physically like cigarettes, but then mentally if you smoke too much you won’t be able to stop, and stopping will result in physical withdrawal symptoms.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t think you would suffer withdrawal symptoms, since it doesn’t cause physical addiction, however yes it can be mentally addictive, however for most people I believe it’s like a masturbation addiction, it’s nice however sooner or later you’ll grow out of it and can always stop.</p>

<p>You said people who want to do LSD and stuff may want to practice with weed first… but doesn’t that mean that by smoking weed it is allowing them to do other drugs.

As far as I know, most people drink alcohol before they start marijuana. Or at least in every case I’ve seen, I know things are different depending where you live and how people act etc. So would that not make alcohol the gateway drug?[/quote]</p>
<p>It is true, In fact I don’t believe I have ever smoked weed unless I had already had a few drinks.</p>

As far as I know, most people drink alcohol before they start marijuana. Or at least in every case I’ve seen, I know things are different depending where you live and how people act etc. So would that not make alcohol the gateway drug? Edit: Oh I kind of didn’t answer your question. As far as I know, basically what the gateway theory means is that you get bored of marijuana and you want to try harder drugs. I suppose it depends how you define the gateway theory. From your perspective, I can’t really see it as being a negative thing so if that’s what makes it a gateway drug, well so be it. I’m fine with that.</p>
<p>It’s true that after a while you may desire something more then marijuana. But it doesn’t necessarily lead you into harder drugs like heroin. I think when marijuana is done is moderation, there is no gateway effect.</p>
<blockquote>3. Marijuana is a "gateway" drug -- it leads to hard drugs
<pre><code> This is one of the more persistent myths.  A real world
</code></pre>
<p>example of what happens when marijuana is readily available can be<br>
found in Holland.  The Dutch partially legalized marijuana in the<br>
1970s.  Since then, hard drug use – heroin and cocaine – have<br>
DECLINED substantially.  If marijuana really were a gateway drug,<br>
one would have expected use of hard drugs to have gone up, not<br>
down.  This apparent “negative gateway” effect has also been<br>
observed in the United States.  Studies done in the early 1970s<br>
showed a negative correlation between use of marijuana and use of<br>
alcohol.  A 1993 Rand Corporation study that compared drug use in<br>
states that had decriminalized marijuana versus those that had not,<br>
found that where marijuana was more available – the states that<br>
had decriminalized – hard drug abuse as measured by emergency room<br>
episodes decreased.  In short, what science and actual experience<br>
tell us is that marijuana tends to substitute for the much more<br>
dangerous hard drugs like alcohol, cocaine, and heroin.</p>

</aside>
<p>There’s been evidence that marijuana could actually enhance driving skills, I think BBC made a video about it. Although I would have to disagree entirely. While on drugs, your reaction time and judgment is impaired significantly, and that makes driving under the influence very dangerous. I wouldn’t recommend it. I’ve driven stoned, but very carefully and it wasn’t pleasant because I let my paranoia get the worst of me. “OMG IS THAT AN UNDERCOVER COP?? OSHIT I HOPE I DONT HIT THIS KIDD” lol.</p>

              <p>JME… nice post but i have to disagree with the gateway thing.</p>
<p>You said people who want to do LSD and stuff may want to practice with weed first… but doesn’t that mean that by smoking weed it is allowing them to do other drugs. I’m pretty sure nearly all drug users have started off with weed first, because they all know it’s the safest. So, in my opinion I think weed is a, if not <span class="bbcode-b">the</span>, gateway drug.</p>
