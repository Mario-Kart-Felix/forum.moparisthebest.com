<p>I completely agree with your whole post but you estimate deaths from canabis at about 50,000<br>
and about 440,000 with cigarettes. If you understand what im saying i don’t believe alot of people smoke canabis… id say 1 in 30 does it regularly, wherase i believe something like 1/4 people smoke. So basically i think that evens the odds on deaths from cigarettes and canabis.</p>
<p>And also sorry for the bad wording in the above paragraph… my mind keeps going blank.</p>

<p>Read the rest of my post, cannabis doesn’t contribute to nearly as much disease’s as tobacco. Feel free to find a real number for me, though.</p>
<p>Ohh yeah, I feel I was being fairly generous with that number. It’s random.</p>

<p>Drugs like marijuana and mushrooms can be safely used easily.</p>
<p>I hate using erowid for <span class="bbcode-i">everything</span> so I did some quick searches.</p>
<p>Some good points from <a href="http://www.ccguide.org.uk/young88.php" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.ccguide.org.uk/young88.php</a></p>
<p>“Nearly all medicines have toxic, potentially lethal effects. But marijuana is not such a substance. There is no record in the extensive medical literature describing a proven, documented cannabis-induced fatality.”<br>
Remember, there’s proof that is has been in use for 5,000 years. And not a single direct death caused by marijuana alone.</p>
<p>“By contrast aspirin, a commonly used, over-the-counter medicine, causes hundreds of deaths each year.”<br>
Hell, marijuana is 100x the painkiller aspirin is anyways.</p>
<p>“Marijuana, in its natural form, is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man. By any measure of rational analysis marijuana can be safely used within a supervised routine of medical care.”</p>
<p>“In strict medical terms marijuana is far safer than many foods we commonly consume. For example, eating ten raw potatoes can result in a toxic response. By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat enough marijuana to induce death.”</p>
<p>And, from <a href="http://ca.askmen.com/sports/health/20_mens_health.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://ca.askmen.com/sports/health/20_mens_health.html</a><br>
For those unaware, askmen is a popular website that even many celebrities enjoy browsing. I would consider it a reliable source(and no, not just because celebs use it, I don’t mean to come off that way).</p>
<p>“Marijuana is psychoactive because it stimulates certain brain receptors, but it does not produce toxins that kill them (like alcohol), and it does not wear them out as other drugs may. There is no evidence that marijuana use causes brain damage. Studies performed on actual human populations will confirm these results, even for chronic marijuana users (up to 18 joints per day) after many years of use.”</p>
<p>“In reality, marijuana has the effect of slightly increasing alpha-wave activity in your brain. Alpha waves are generally associated with meditative and relaxed states, which are, in turn, often associated with human creativity.”</p>
<p>“Chronic marijuana use has not been found to alter testosterone or other sex hormone levels. In contrast, heavy alcohol use is known to lower these same testosterone levels.”</p>
<p>“No trustworthy study has ever shown that marijuana use damages the reproductive system, or causes chromosome breakage. Studies of actual human populations have failed to demonstrate that marijuana adversely affects the reproductive system. Claims that marijuana use may impair hormone production, menstrual cycles, or fertility in females are both unproven and unfounded.”</p>
<p>The only evidence showing that it could harm the immune system:<br>
“Studies in which lab rats were injected with extremely large quantities of THC (the active compound in marijuana) have found that marijuana (in such unrealistically huge quantities) does have an “immunosuppressive effect” in those lab rats, in that it temporarily shuts off certain cells in the liver called lymphocytes and macrophages. These macrophages are useful in fighting off bacterial, not viral, infections.<br>
…<br>
This said, doctors and researchers are still not sure that the immune system is actually negatively affected in realistic situations since there are no numbers to support the idea. In fact, three studies showed that THC might have actually stimulated the immune system in the people studied.”</p>
<p>Yes, cancer is possible.<br>
“Smoking marijuana has the potential to cause both bronchitis and cancer of the lungs, throat, and neck, but this is generally no different than inhaling any other burnt carbon-containing matter since they all increase the number of lesions (and therefore possible infections) in your airways.”</p>
<p>I quoted this because I wanted to bring up that some recent studies have been showing that THC(the active ingredient in marijuana) kills aging or mutated cells which are potentially cancerous. It’s also been proven to shrink the size of tumors. Google it.</p>
<p>“Marijuana use has not been found to act as a gateway drug to the use of harder drugs. Studies show that when the Dutch partially legalized marijuana in the 70’s, heroin and cocaine use substantially declined, despite a slight increase in marijuana use.”<br>
Also I should mention that the percentage of marijuana smokers in the Netherlands is almost half of what it is in the united states. Personally I think the reason people believe in the gateway theory is simply because people do marijuana before they do harder drugs. Think about this for a minute. I don’t know about you, but before trying LSD or another powerful drug, wouldn’t you like some practice with something first?</p>
<p>I should mention some health benefits. Marijuana is often used to treat cancer/chemo patients and AIDS patients to reduce nausea and to increase appetite. Without it, many would die much quicker and would have a much harder time coping with the cancer/aids. It has has anti-inflammatory properties, so it helps with problems like chron’s disease and other medical problems caused by inflammation of various body parts. It is used to treat glaucoma because it lowers the pressure inside the eyeball. It’s also used for curing headaches, nausea, pain, etc. And I know there is much much more. I can tell you from personal experience, if you have a cold or a flu, no medicine can even compare to marijuana. Smoking it in the morning gives relief from flu’s and colds all day long.</p>
<p>Now, why is marijuana illegal you ask? Well if it was legal, it would cripple many industries. Such as, “Clothing, paper, medicine, herbal, cooking, skin care, [oil]…” Personally I don’t believe that “they can’t tax it thing” sure they can! They could make a nice profit too.</p>
<p>A lot of people think that if it was legalized, then everyone would become pot heads and everywhere you look people will be lighting up weed. Obviously there would be public intoxication laws for one thing. And as you may know, if someone wants to get high, they are going to do it regardless of the law. legalization generally will support the current smokers, I doubt there would be an increase(if any) pot smokers. The only difference is now the current ones don’t go to jail, and murderers are not released early to make room for non-violent pot smokers serving a life sentence for their “third-strike.”</p>
<p>I just realized that this thread is about drugs in general. Of course many drugs are harmful, but I for one would like to dispel many of the marijuana myths.</p>
<p>Now for my opinion on alcohol <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smiley1bce.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>I don’t like it very much. probably from 12-14 I got drunk twice every weekend with my friends. I used to love it, I thought it was harmless. I never got hangovers and it was only pure fun. Unfortunately nowadays for some reason I get very sick, I get horrible hangovers, and I have more dysphoria then euphoria. It makes me want to control everyone and what they do, and I get angry when they don’t do it.</p>
<p>Heh, I just liked this one guys point of view about getting drunk.<br>
Some things to remember is that it’s an anesthetic solvent depressant just like gasoline, or sniffing glue.</p>
<blockquote>Would you go into your shed and pick up a tank of gasoline and go relax at a bar, huffing here and there, with other gas huffers to the point of vomiting and passing out?
<p>Sure, it’s not exactly the same, but alcohol is like gasoline-lite. It’s legal, it’s available, “everyone” does it, and it holds a special status as “not being a drug.”</p>
</blockquote><br>
I realize this probably means nothing though. His point was that it isn’t there to get hammered. As he did illustrate the good points of alcohol:
<blockquote>A drink or two is beneficial in some ways, does not produce violent hangovers, enhances cardiovascular health, reduces stress, provides enjoyment and sociality, and kills time.</blockquote>
<p>To me, long term effects of drugs are much more important to look at then a short term effect. Alcohol leads to liver disease, stomach ulcers, and central nervous system deterioration and probably more. Marijuana basically can lead to lung cancer, which can be completely prevented.</p>
<p>But finaly what I want to say is that drugs can be safely used. Before you bash drugs, try them first. Decide for yourself if they are worth potential health effects. Don’t forget, drugs are no more harmful then the many things our culture seems to accept. Starving yourself to become skinny, eating too much, sitting on the computer all day or around the TV, breathing in polluted air, burning our skin to a rediculous level(have you seen some people! They almost turn black trying to get a tan and they continually use the tanning salons). I dunno, a million more.</p>
<p>Sorry for the lack of structure in this post. I’m currently on LSA and it’s as if theres 10000 million thoughts going through my head right now. Actually, this post seems so random to me right now that I am debating to post it. I’m posting it only because that would be a huge waste of time not to.</p>
<p>I think I’ll go enjoy outside…</p>

<p>I’ve never heard of people suffering withdrawal symptoms other then that they miss it and maybe irritability.</p>
<p>I quit ~2 weeks ago for the rest of summer. Never felt a thing, and I am a daily smoker. I don’t even miss it to be honest. But I guess there are a lot of people with addictive personalities so I can’t speak for everyone.</p>

<p>You said people who want to do LSD and stuff may want to practice with weed first… but doesn’t that mean that by smoking weed it is allowing them to do other drugs. I’m pretty sure nearly all drug users have started off with weed first, because they all know it’s the safest.

As far as I know, most people drink alcohol before they start marijuana. Or at least in every case I’ve seen, I know things are different depending where you live and how people act etc. So would that not make alcohol the gateway drug? Edit: Oh I kind of didn’t answer your question. As far as I know, basically what the gateway theory means is that you get bored of marijuana and you want to try harder drugs. I suppose it depends how you define the gateway theory. From your perspective, I can’t really see it as being a negative thing so if that’s what makes it a gateway drug, well so be it. I’m fine with that.</p>
<p>It’s true that after a while you may desire something more then marijuana. But it doesn’t necessarily lead you into harder drugs like heroin. I think when marijuana is done is moderation, there is no gateway effect.</p>
<blockquote>3. Marijuana is a "gateway" drug -- it leads to hard drugs
<pre><code> This is one of the more persistent myths.  A real world
</code></pre>
<p>example of what happens when marijuana is readily available can be<br>
found in Holland.  The Dutch partially legalized marijuana in the<br>
1970s.  Since then, hard drug use – heroin and cocaine – have<br>
DECLINED substantially.  If marijuana really were a gateway drug,<br>
one would have expected use of hard drugs to have gone up, not<br>
down.  This apparent “negative gateway” effect has also been<br>
observed in the United States.  Studies done in the early 1970s<br>
showed a negative correlation between use of marijuana and use of<br>
alcohol.  A 1993 Rand Corporation study that compared drug use in<br>
states that had decriminalized marijuana versus those that had not,<br>
found that where marijuana was more available – the states that<br>
had decriminalized – hard drug abuse as measured by emergency room<br>
episodes decreased.  In short, what science and actual experience<br>
tell us is that marijuana tends to substitute for the much more<br>
dangerous hard drugs like alcohol, cocaine, and heroin.</p>

</aside>
<p>There’s been evidence that marijuana could actually enhance driving skills, I think BBC made a video about it. Although I would have to disagree entirely. While on drugs, your reaction time and judgment is impaired significantly, and that makes driving under the influence very dangerous. I wouldn’t recommend it. I’ve driven stoned, but very carefully and it wasn’t pleasant because I let my paranoia get the worst of me. “OMG IS THAT AN UNDERCOVER COP?? OSHIT I HOPE I DONT HIT THIS KIDD” lol.</p>

JME… nice post but i have to disagree with the gateway thing.</p>
<p>You said people who want to do LSD and stuff may want to practice with weed first… but doesn’t that mean that by smoking weed it is allowing them to do other drugs. I’m pretty sure nearly all drug users have started off with weed first, because they all know it’s the safest. So, in my opinion I think weed is a, if not <span class="bbcode-b">the</span>, gateway drug.<br>
[/quote]<br>
As far as I know, most people drink alcohol before they start marijuana. Or at least in every case I’ve seen, I know things are different depending where you live and how people act etc. So would that not make alcohol the gateway drug?[/quote]</p>
<p>It is true, In fact I don’t believe I have ever smoked weed unless I had already had a few drinks.</p>

<p>A few people mentioned that weed is not addictive.  From personal experience with multiple people that I know, it most certainly IS addictive.  Maybe not physically like cigarettes, but then mentally if you smoke too much you won’t be able to stop, and stopping will result in physical withdrawal symptoms.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t think you would suffer withdrawal symptoms, since it doesn’t cause physical addiction, however yes it can be mentally addictive, however for most people I believe it’s like a masturbation addiction, it’s nice however sooner or later you’ll grow out of it and can always stop.</p>

<p>No I understand.</p>
<p>It’s funny words to most. Yet if I said alcohol can be used safely I bet you wouldn’t have quoted me, even though it’s more dangerous…To some degree anyways. Obviously that can be argued.</p>

<p>I started using pot because I found out I was lied to about it. And I will smoke all I want thank you very much. It’s a life style I chose for myself, it does not concern you in anyway.

<p>Funny stuff on that site though. I didn’t read it all, it’s the general propaganda designed for children to scare them away instead of properly educating them to make informed descisions.</p>
<p>Hmm, so lets see if I am doing drugs:</p>
<p>-lose interest in school – Well, I have interest in school but due to circumstances I will not be attended on acount I do not know how(moved out with my brother) and also I will soon be making double the amount of money my dad makes. I was just about to graduate anyways.<br>
-change friends (to hang out with kids who use drugs) – Nope. Sure I make new friends, but I never lose them. Not to drugs anyways.<br>
-become moody, negative, cranky, or worried all the time – nope<br>
-ask to be left alone a lot – nope<br>
-have trouble concentrating – nope, I’m even sharper if anything<br>
-sleep a lot (maybe even in class)  – nope, less then average if anything<br>
-get in fights – nope<br>
-have red or puffy eyes – red when stoned…<br>
-lose or gain weight – nope, actually I’ve been the same weight for about 4-5 years now<br>
-cough a lot – no but if I feel my lungs getting sore then I quit for at least a couple weeks to a month.<br>
-have a runny nose all of the time – lol nope, I’m not a coke head.[/quote]<br>
No offense man, but IMO there are no “informed decisions” when it comes to doing something illegal.  Also, do you want to know how many people have died because of drug overdoses?  My own uncle drank until his skin was fucking yellow and then put himself into a spiral of depression and eventually death for ten years.  He lost his house, wife and kids.  My dad’s cousin lost his daugheter, wife and house and trucking business because he used amphetamine and now he’s 50 drifting in and out of jail.  He was a burnout in high school and eventually progressed to where he is now. My other uncle fried his brain using acid and now he’s about as smart as a 5-year-old.  My dad’s friend in college died after doing acid one time.  Is a 10 minute high and wasting money buying some shit that came from god knows where that has god knows what in it worth any of these scenarios or worse?  I’m not saying this to be mean to you guys who use drugs but I’ve seen the affects that drugs can have on people firsthand.  I want to help you understand that you think it’s just fun and games until something like this happens.  You might think now “oh its only pot” but eventually you’re doing worse and worse shit.  Everyone who says drugs don’t do anything bad are just lying to themselves.</p>

<p>Well that would be your uncles fault, but just because he can’t use drugs responsibly doesn’t mean I can’t. Pot isn’t all I use of course. I enjoy many other drugs, but there are many that I swear I will never touch.</p>
<p>Most drugs I’ve done are nearly impossible to overdose on. And how people overdose anyways is beyond me. I pick a safe dose and I do it, simple as that. And I agree, 10 minute highs are no fun. Thats why I don’t do any drugs that only last 10 minutes. Well, salvia lasts 5 minutes but it most certainly feels like forever, and it’s legal and pretty damn safe to use.</p>
<p>I’ll never touch meth, or heroin, or crack, etc. Before using any new drug, I research my ass off. Literally I’ll spend days on the computer reading everything I can. Hundreds of trip reports, health effects, etc.</p>
<p>I’ve enjoyed the use of acid, Studies show that LSD doesn’t cause cancer, brain damage, or chromosome breakage. It’s also impossible to OD on. However I too can relate, my friends uncle is pretty messed up and he has a “mental” addiction to acid. Personally I’ve only used it once every 2-3 months and it’s a somewhat recent thing. Of course there are mental effects to the use, <a href="http://www.doitnow.org/pages/115.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.doitnow.org/pages/115.html</a></p>
<p>I know it seems like I talk about drugs a lot, and oh boy I must be screwed since It’s all I talk about, etc… There’s simply not a whole lot that interests me on this forum anymore so thats why I am so active in drug discussions. Generally the only thing noticable to my health is my lungs, if I’m smoking too much I just stop for a good while and I slow it down then. Which is what I am currently doing.</p>
