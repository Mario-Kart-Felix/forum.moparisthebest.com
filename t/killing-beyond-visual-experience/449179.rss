Very dedicated team of 2 Staff members, I myself, and my friend h0ly in New Jersey.

We have a lot of stuff on our hands dealing with multiple things at once between 2 people in different states. 

Our server has been up for about a month now.
\
We just havn&#39;t advertised as much since we don&#39;t have a webclient up and running and people usually won&#39;t play without one.

The owner of this forums, and server is one of the previous owners of Yanillescape, he has the creds to prove it aswell. 

We would like you to come on this journey with us on a fantastic new private server in the rsps community. 

Lets start a revolution.

There is custom classes being worked on that will be released soon in the near future. 
Assassin, Merchant Etc...
Healing Monk Spawns
PKING
ECONOMY
SQL Loading/Saving
Much more,
We just need a bigger team to work with.
