    <title>How can i make my client custom model compatible</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-can-i-make-my-client-custom-model-compatible/359001</link>
    <description>well first of all i thought this would go into this sections because it deals with the client not model.


So how do i setup my client so i can add custom models? I have a 317, and it is a blank client that is not custom model compatible. Can someone explain how to make it compatible with customs? If it includes the commands to add models please tell me that too.</description>
