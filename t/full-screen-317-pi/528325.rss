    <description>Will someone help me, or guide me of how to make a full screen pi?
I have tried but have got a few errors.

I have tried customization to the cache and client.java,
but it lead me to no-where. 
I know your thinking, &quot;download deathlypvpz, or download
blahh blahh.&quot;

Well it isn&#39;t that simple. I&#39;m anquired down with my source,
because i have fixed so many glitches, and bugs that i don&#39;t
want to download another source that needs more work.

It would be very amazing if i got some help.
Send me a private and i&#39;ll give you my Skype.
I also would pay if this works.</description>
