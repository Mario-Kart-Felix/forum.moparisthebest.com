    <title>What are your political views?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-are-your-political-views/466140</link>
    <description>Just interested to see what some others have to say, maybe have a discussion about things. I&#39;ll explain my current view point for the United States&#39; current state with the presidential election coming up in a few days. 

Personally, I think that government will be corrupt and filled with secrets and lies, just to persuade the citizens that they are doing something productive and useful. I may only be 15 years old, but I&#39;m not like the other 15 year old&#39;s who go on Facebook and post, &quot;#TeamOBAMA, BLACK PRESIDENTTzx.&quot; And shit like that, I find that really annoying.

Though Barack Obama has done a few good things, I believe he was elected because people wanted to see a change in politics. They wanted to put a black president in office, so they can start saying, &quot;Oh my god, look how much things have changed since slavery times.&quot; I believe it&#39;s complete bull shit that they would vote depending on ones skin color, which is what some people did. And then there are the hardcore racists who didn&#39;t vote for him because he was black. 

I also believe that it&#39;s dumb how people who are 18-22 for the most part haven&#39;t developed their own political viewpoint, meaning, they&#39;re going to vote for whoever their parents are voting for. I also hate when people vote for someone just because of their political party, Republican and Democratic parties have swapped back and forth ever since we&#39;ve had them. Not all Republicans are assholes (as people say) and not all Democrats are only helping the middle class citizens. Most people just vote depending on what political party they want, which is usually what their parents vote for, they vote, without knowing what that person is promising.

One final thing on Barack Obama, he promised he would do much more in his four year term, which he didn&#39;t complete. From what I&#39;ve found, he&#39;s only done about 33% of what he promised. Away from Barack Obama and on to the Republican party, Mitt Romney. I don&#39;t believe that he is an evil man as everyone says, however, it doesn&#39;t sound like he has a very strong plan put together. And people claiming he&#39;s sexist due to the fact he had a, &#39;binder of women&#39; are just retarded. When he saw all male candidates laid out on a table for his choosing, if he was really sexist he wouldn&#39;t have asked for any female options.

Those are my main points, please note that it doesn&#39;t matter what political power is in ruling, I say fuck the government either way. I don&#39;t associate with either political party, as they change so often, though my family is Democratic.

What are your thoughts Moparscape?</description>

<p>I don’t have any, I treat the news and political debates as entertainment, just like I was watching Family Guy or playing Runescape, it’s all fictious garbage. All of it, this includes but isn’t limited to the economy, votes, polls, referendums, affiliations etc etc.</p>

Yeah that’s the one, was trying to play from memory. I said it was a joke, not going to shit. It is a joke. How petty are people becoming? I’m also pretty sure that the landlord would of been “advised” by health and safety ofsted anyway.</p>
<p>No there are other examples, for instance I just read:</p>
<p>Some kids went to see a man in a Spongebob Squarepants costume turn on some Christmas lights, but at the last minute he was told the costume was too wide to walk up the 5 steps to the stage, and that he would only be able to wear the costume for 40 minutes anyway due to health and safety guidelines. This resulted in sobbing and disappointed kids. People who make up these guidelines need to get down to Earth a little bit in their lives.</p>
<p>It’s all completely unnecessary, whether it be H&amp;S, or a landlord, or whoever.</p>
