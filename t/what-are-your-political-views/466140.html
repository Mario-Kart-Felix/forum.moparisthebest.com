        <p>Just interested to see what some others have to say, maybe have a discussion about things. I’ll explain my current view point for the United States’ current state with the presidential election coming up in a few days.</p>
<p>Personally, I think that government will be corrupt and filled with secrets and lies, just to persuade the citizens that they are doing something productive and useful. I may only be 15 years old, but I’m not like the other 15 year old’s who go on Facebook and post, “<span class="hashtag">#TeamOBAMA</span>, BLACK PRESIDENTTzx.” And shit like that, I find that really annoying.</p>
<p>Though Barack Obama has done a few good things, I believe he was elected because people wanted to see a change in politics. They wanted to put a black president in office, so they can start saying, “Oh my god, look how much things have changed since slavery times.” I believe it’s complete bull shit that they would vote depending on ones skin color, which is what some people did. And then there are the hardcore racists who didn’t vote for him because he was black.</p>
<p>I also believe that it’s dumb how people who are 18-22 for the most part haven’t developed their own political viewpoint, meaning, they’re going to vote for whoever their parents are voting for. I also hate when people vote for someone just because of their political party, Republican and Democratic parties have swapped back and forth ever since we’ve had them. Not all Republicans are assholes (as people say) and not all Democrats are only helping the middle class citizens. Most people just vote depending on what political party they want, which is usually what their parents vote for, they vote, without knowing what that person is promising.</p>
<p>One final thing on Barack Obama, he promised he would do much more in his four year term, which he didn’t complete. From what I’ve found, he’s only done about 33% of what he promised. Away from Barack Obama and on to the Republican party, Mitt Romney. I don’t believe that he is an evil man as everyone says, however, it doesn’t sound like he has a very strong plan put together. And people claiming he’s sexist due to the fact he had a, ‘binder of women’ are just retarded. When he saw all male candidates laid out on a table for his choosing, if he was really sexist he wouldn’t have asked for any female options.</p>
<p>Those are my main points, please note that it doesn’t matter what political power is in ruling, I say fuck the government either way. I don’t associate with either political party, as they change so often, though my family is Democratic.</p>

<p>Are you mentally incapable of comprehending this post? I’m not like other 15 year old’s meaning I don’t go on Facebook posting stuff about Barack Obama, like some do. Those who do don’t even have a reason to side with him, other than the fact that their parents are voting for him, and he’s a black president. And also, what are you talking about with that second post? I was stating that people that age haven’t developed a political viewpoint, so they vote for whatever their parents vote for, with having no reason at all. I’ve developed my own personal political viewpoint, that’s completely different than my parents political viewpoint.</p>

<p>My political viewpoint differs greatly from my parents. Sadly, they vote for the Democratic party, no matter what, they said that in exact words. However, I vote for whichever party seems to have a better plan put together, and previous work and experience. And you’re right, I shouldn’t really generalize and say that ALL people in that age group haven’t developed a political viewpoint, from what I’ve seen, most haven’t.</p>

<p>my political views are that first past the post voting systems are absolutely retarded and lead to 2 party systems like what the US has, BOTH of those parties are actually incredibly far right to European politics to the point where our right wing parties would be considered left wing to the US<br>

<p>Are you mentally incapable of comprehending this post? I’m not like other 15 year old’s meaning I don’t go on Facebook posting stuff about Barack Obama, like some do. Those who do don’t even have a reason to side with him, other than the fact that their parents are voting for him, and he’s a black president. And also, what are you talking about with that second post? I was stating that people that age haven’t developed a political viewpoint, so they vote for whatever their parents vote for, with having no reason at all. I’ve developed my own personal political viewpoint, that’s completely different than my parents political viewpoint.[/quote]</p>

        <p>That democrats would run the us into the ground like they have been doing. But big business needs to go away. Greed is what drives capitalism which is a horrible thing to be being a driving force of anything; up right next to lust.</p>
<p>What needs to be the driving forces for a peaceful world is selfless, caring, compassion, and tolerance. Treating everyone as you would like to be treated, helping out your fellow people and in turn they will help you out when you need help.</p>
<p>in today’s society, some people you can help them out and they would never help you out b/c they are selfish and self centered. etc. We don’t live in a very caring society but a society that is an “all about me me me and who care about you” mentality.</p>

<p>I would respond to this by asking you if you were in fact mentally incapable of comprehending the english language</p>
<p>you state you are unlike 15 year olds in your first post, because you do not go on ‘facebook posting about politics’ the same time as posting on mitb about politics, the cognitive dissonance you display is unbelievable</p>
<p>and before you come back with some bullshit argument like “oh but I’m not posting about obama, I hate that guy!”, may I refer you to the fact that a HELL of a lot of members on this forum, from america, are also as anti-obama as you portray yourself to be</p>

<p>well good for you, [SAR FUCKING CASM] I’ve developed my own personal beliefs that murder is indeed not wrong because my parents believe murder is wrong, and I can’t hold the same ideals my parents have! [/SAR FUCKING CASM]</p>
<p>not pictured here is that yes, you fucking are like every other 15 fucking year old out there, there’s 2 main camps and a plethora of other minority camps, you have the (who you refer to as every other 15 year old) ‘I’m 15 and involved in politics and am voting for a president who supports my age group’ and then you have the counter to that, your group, ‘I’m 15 and fuck those other 15 year olds I’m not like them’</p>
<p>seriously, I’m not even 6 years older than you and I’ve been around long enough to see enough ‘I’m not like every other x year old, I hold a popular opposing opinion to them!’, and I can safely say that you’re just as bad as the people in the ‘I don’t listen to rap, I’m the minority that still listens to rock!’ group</p>

<p>Today’s people in power are so hung up on self importance and greed, not to mention the ridiculous amounts of money being spent on SHIT, that society is starting to follow trend and forgetting what it’s like to just be human.</p>

<p>the reason why this seems corrupt and wrong is because it’s utter bunk, for a start it wasn’t an “old people’s home” it was the communal area of a block of flats and the ‘ban’ extended to anything combustible such as carpets and door mats in the communal area which is the only fire exit, not to mention that any personal effects in the communal area were against the tenancy agreement</p>
<p>of course the sun nor dailymail ever followed this story up and it’s the only article of its kind so it doesn’t say much, but who exactly were they banned by? the freaking landlord who owned the flats, if this is the best you can come up with for why health and safety is bunk I’m quite loveing reassured that the country isn’t going to shit</p>

Yeah that’s the one, was trying to play from memory. I said it was a joke, not going to shit. It is a joke. How petty are people becoming? I’m also pretty sure that the landlord would of been “advised” by health and safety ofsted anyway.</p>
<p>No there are other examples, for instance I just read:</p>
<p>Some kids went to see a man in a Spongebob Squarepants costume turn on some Christmas lights, but at the last minute he was told the costume was too wide to walk up the 5 steps to the stage, and that he would only be able to wear the costume for 40 minutes anyway due to health and safety guidelines. This resulted in sobbing and disappointed kids. People who make up these guidelines need to get down to Earth a little bit in their lives.</p>
<p>It’s all completely unnecessary, whether it be H&amp;S, or a landlord, or whoever.</p>
