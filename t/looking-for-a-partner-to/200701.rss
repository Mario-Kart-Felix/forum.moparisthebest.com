    <title>Looking for a partner to</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-partner-to/200701</link>
    <description>Hi, I am back to this forums now. After my computer was broken when I got it fixed he just asked me to help him make a private server for World of Warcraft server. This has not been put public yet due to us still doing a few more tweeks to it. That was interesting so, I have finaly come back to this forums and now I am here to create a runescape private server. 

Things I want on this server will be the following.

~The least amount of public voids possible
~Dedicated server. I will be paying for this once I think we are ready. (Friend said I can go halfers on the 2 servers he is paying for when he brings his WoW server public.)
~Good economy
~Good PVPing 
~Perfect specials
~No &quot;Silabs items&quot;
~Eventually a client

If you want to join me you must go and download Vent. I will PM you the information to the server I will be using.

Thank you, for taking the time to read this.

~Spidaz

edit~ Please no flam,spam, or cursing in this thread Thank you</description>

Hi, I am back to this forums now. After my computer was broken when I got it fixed he just asked me to help him make a private server for World of Warcraft server.

~Dedicated server. I will be paying for this once I think we are ready. (Friend said I can go halfers on the 2 servers he is paying for when he brings his WoW server public.)<br>
~Good economy<br>
~Good PVPing<br>

~Eventually a client</p>
<p>If you want to join me you must go and download Vent. I will PM you the information to the server I will be using.</p>
<p>Thank you, for taking the time to read this.</p>

<p>No, I was thinking more like handlers and lots of them. If that answers your question.</p>
