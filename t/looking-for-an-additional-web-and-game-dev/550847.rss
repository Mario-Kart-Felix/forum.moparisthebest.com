    <title>Looking for an additional Web and Game Dev</title>

    <description>Hi there Mopar.
My name is Devin, and I currently own the Zailyx RS servers (Revisions 718 and 317). 

I am on a salaried position so my hours vary weekly and I simply do not have the amount of time I would like to invest in making these servers great. So I have decided after several months, to bring a few new members on to my team.

Current Positions needing to be filled:
[code]2X Assistant Content Developer
Web Developer:
Graphics Artisist:[/code]


If you would like to take a look at the current server we have online and available for play, you can view our current thread below:

Please respond below (if interested) with your current credentials and availability schedule, as well as position desired.

Thank you for your time!</description>
