January 23 2015 Membership Price Changes - 1st March 2015
In November, we announced that we would be increasing the price of membership for new members and those who&#39;ve been unsubscribed for more than 14 days.

Today, we can confirm that this will come into effect on the 1st of March 2015. You can find the new pricing below:

The price of Bonds will also increase:

Don&#39;t forget - as long as you&#39;re a member and don&#39;t lapse out for more than 14 days, you&#39;re eligible to keep your current rate of membership. Subscribe now to secure access to all of RuneScape&#39;s members&#39; content at current prices.

As always, we&#39;re committed to giving you the very best value for your membership. Even at the new full price, RuneScape is highly competitive with other MMOs, and we&#39;ve got great plans for the rest of 2015.

Thanks again for your ongoing support. Visit our FAQ if you have any further questions.

              <p>Well, I am not a big fan of it either, but Jagex fucked up with some bad investments like transformers universe which was a total flop so now they are making up with it with this. Look on the bright side though, just don’t cancel your membership and you will still always have the same old membership prices. Also, if you buy bulk membership it still comes out to a very decent price 12 months is like $7.50 a month which is 1 hour minimum wage, honestly who the fuck can’t afford that? One other thing that will most likely come from this is permanent f2p, Jagex has a “BIG” announcement planned for this Sunday, which should mean permanent f2p access for the f2p part of the game.</p>
