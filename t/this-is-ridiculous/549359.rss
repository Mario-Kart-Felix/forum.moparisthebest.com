    <description>Membership Price Changes - 1st March 2015

January 23 2015 Membership Price Changes - 1st March 2015
In November, we announced that we would be increasing the price of membership for new members and those who&#39;ve been unsubscribed for more than 14 days.

Today, we can confirm that this will come into effect on the 1st of March 2015. You can find the new pricing below:

US, UK, EU, AU and CA membership prices
The price of Bonds will also increase:

US, UK, EU, AU and CA Bond prices
Don&#39;t forget - as long as you&#39;re a member and don&#39;t lapse out for more than 14 days, you&#39;re eligible to keep your current rate of membership. Subscribe now to secure access to all of RuneScape&#39;s members&#39; content at current prices.

As always, we&#39;re committed to giving you the very best value for your membership. Even at the new full price, RuneScape is highly competitive with other MMOs, and we&#39;ve got great plans for the rest of 2015.

Thanks again for your ongoing support. Visit our FAQ if you have any further questions.

              <p>Don’t lose your membership, and you’ll be fine. Plus, if you don’t want to spend real money on it, use in-game GP to get bonds. They’ll rise, of course, but not a whole lot. I’m assuming they’ll be around 10m-ish, which is less than 1.5 hours at RoTS, 2-2.5 hours at QBD, and just a few kills at Nex, which really isn’t that much time spent getting 14 days of membership.</p>

<p>Jibes aside, I’ve always looked at these games the same way. How much time do you put into the game? You can argue all you want about how much content there is and how many updates there are per month, but strictly speaking the only thing that matters in my opinion is your time put in and if you consider that to be worth your money. Some people spend 30-60 dollars for games that they spend maybe 10-20 hours beating and then never play again. That means you’re paying lets say 3 dollars per hour of play time. That sounds like a bit much though, so lets just cut that down and assume you get 60 hours out of that title, cutting it to 1 dollar per hour of playtime. Do you play RS more than 10 hours a month? If you do, it’s probably not a big deal that they are increasing the cost.</p>
