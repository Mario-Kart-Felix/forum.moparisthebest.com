              <p>You fail to listen and understand.<br>
I repeat, when I ban… I IP ban.<br>
This means in order for you to log back in the server… you need a new IP, unless ur a hacker or ask your ISP for a new IP or get a new computer, or modem.</p>
<p>So it wasnt me. The only other OP i have, DOESNT ban unless she ask me. I didnt tell her to do it that way, she decides to ask me for permission to do stuff like banning people.</p>
<p>And your IGN is Herobrine? Is it Notch, and Honeydew as well? Any server admin should know that they should ban “Herobrine” “Notch” “Honeydew” “Player” and "   ".</p>
<p>I have plenty of players who multi accounts, cracked clients, bought clients who play. And out of ALL of them you were specially chosen to by mysteriously banned? Since my server went up, over 1000 people has played.</p>
<p>If your IP is “3” in which its supposedly said to be over Hat trix… why didnt you think to go to another server, or make up another name. Guess your IQ points is in your ass instead of your head. As an admin of a server for 3-4 months… who started the server off of hamachi run by his laptop, who upgraded to an official server, have never heard of crap like this. And i went through quite a bit of OP’s and griefers. The server was always offline mode so cracked clients can play. I myself started off with a cracked client and when testing stuff use random names.</p>
<p>This argument is over. Go find another server.</p>

I told you this like 5 times now, when will you decide to listen?  I logged INTO the GAME and was BANNED.  NO REASON AT ALL.

I'm not sure if I told you this, although since you obviously don't like listening to me and don't like accepting that your wrong, I logged INTO the GAME and was BANNED.  So I made a new account.
<blockquote>If if for some reason the he somehow talked to an "ADMIN who later claim that he wasnt staff"... that means that a normal player said he was an ADMIN which he never really was.</blockquote>
Still doesn't prove why I was wrongly punished.

^I don't get it, you really love ignoring me don't you?
<p>But it is your fault you pick shitty staff.</p>
<blockquote>But he doesnt say he was IP banned, he was regular banned. So even if...

<blockquote>Either way... being banned means that you did something that deserved the result of you being expelled permanently from the server. That isnt us being abusive.</blockquote>
Getting tired of saying this, seriously, you need to learn to listen.  Didn't you ever go to first grade and learn how to listen, and follow directions? I logged in, didn't say anything, didn't do anything, about 30 seconds later I was banned.

Yes, and your very bad at it.

<p>He just mad cause he’s banned. He cant judge the server cause he basically never played it as well. And the staff is untrustworthy? I am the staff. You didnt tell me ANYTHING. And the only people i banned i have written down in a book. And when i ban, i ban by the IP’s. For you to be IP banned, which means that you had to do something that actually required me to go to the console… look for your IGN, look for the matching IP, and actually ban it.</p>

<p>Posting his server his server here is for it to get some feedback and new players, If you think it’s a great server, then good for you.  Tell him that.  If think it’s a shitty server, I have a right to say it and give a reason why.  Obviously you don’t like playing fair, so please stop.</p>
