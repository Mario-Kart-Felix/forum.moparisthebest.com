    <title>Non working client with vista (Need help)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/non-working-client-with-vista-need-help/287819</link>
    <description>I have tried a series of things to try and log into a certain private server but I keep getting the same message &quot;Error connecting to server&quot; and the server is up. I have looked all through google, and can&#39;t seem to find any answers. I have also tried using &quot;Start Server&quot; on Moparscape.org and it says &quot;couldn&#39;t create directory logs&quot;. I&#39;m just wondering if anyone has the same problem as me, or does it have something to do with Windows Vista.</description>

Go to Control Panel &gt; Security &gt; Allow a programme through Windows Firewall.<br>
Click on the Exceptions tab, then click Add Port.</p>
<p>The name can be whatever you want. the port must be 43594 and the protocol must be TCP.</p>
<p>If that doesn’t work it is probably because the client with files isn’t unzipped.</p>
