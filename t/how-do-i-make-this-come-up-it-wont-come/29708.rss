              <p>testscape sucks ass dont get it get project 16 v4.5 that is the best one so far… i use porject 16 v.6 but v 4.5 has no lag and its easier to use then testscape</p>
<p>pimpscape is a pking source so that everywhere you go you can pk people</p>
<p>make sure you compile after changes and then run the server again or it wont work.</p>
