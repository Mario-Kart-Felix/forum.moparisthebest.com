    <description>I was just wondering what the best method of providing cycles or ticks in my skills would be, like in fishing, getting a certain amount of fish each time you fish at that spot, I was messing with the Event Manager in PI, and it doesn&#39;t seem to suit what I&#39;m trying to do here, what is the best way to do this? If its process() then what would be the best way to use that? Or if its some event system let me know how to use it as well, thanks.</description>

              <p>I don’t know if this would be the best way, but try making a class implementing runnable and somehow set the sleep time like runescape’s tick formula using Thread.sleep(). I’ve never tried writing my own skill class or tick class so I wouldn’t really know.</p>

              <p>I don’t use P.I. but here’s some feedback:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can use that for Fishing, I know, because mine has utilized it in the past.</li>
<li>If any part of your Fishing system is under a Process(), then you need to re-write it A.S.A.P.</li>
<li>Getting a certain amount of fish each time you fish? Check your Calculative math out. It probably involves your Fishing skill level as well.</li>
</ol>
<p>You might want to script parts as well.</p>
