&lt;blockquote&gt;[font=Century Gothic][size=20pt]You&#39;ve reached this page because the site you were trying to visit now blocks the FireFox browser. [/size]

[size=10pt][b]The Mozilla Foundation and its Commercial arm, the Mozilla Corporation, has allowed and endorsed Ad Block Plus, a plug-in that blocks advertisement on web sites and also prevents site owners from blocking people using it. Software that blocks all advertisement is an infringement of the rights of web site owners and developers. Numerous web sites exist in order to provide quality content in exchange for displaying ads. Accessing the content while blocking the ads, therefore would be no less than stealing. Millions of hard working people are being robbed of their time and effort by this type of software.  Many site owners therefore install scripts that prevent people using ad blocking software from accessing their site. That is their right as the site owner to insist that the use of their resources accompanies the presence of the ads.

While blanket ad blocking in general is still theft, the real problem is Ad Block Plus&#39;s unwillingness to allow individual site owners the freedom to block people using their plug-in. Blocking FireFox is the only alternative. Demographics have shown that not only are FireFox users a somewhat small percentage of the internet, they actually are even smaller in terms of online spending, therefore blocking FireFox seems to have only minimal financial drawbacks, whereas ending resource theft has tremendous financial rewards for honest, hard-working website owners and developers..

Since the makers of Ad Block Plus as well as the filter subscriptions that accompany it refuse to allow website owners control over their own intellectual property, and since FireFox actively endorses Ad Block Plus, the sites linking to this page are now blocking FireFox until the resource theft is stopped.

Netscape users can simply set their browser to IE mode to continue to enjoy the site that sent you here. FireFox users can use Internet Explorer, Opera or Netscape (in IE mode) to access it. FireFox users also have the option of using the IE Tab plug-in which uses the IE rendering engine to display pages, but also disables the Ad Block Plus plug-in.

If you are offended by the Mozilla Corporation&#39;s endorsement of dishonesty please contact the Mozilla Foundation and ask them to stop empowering internet theft.[/b][/size][/font]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thoughts?  I&#39;d personally never block Firefox, but it does raise a valid point.

My brother is 11, one week and he had roughly 122 different spyware programs on his computer due to one little popup on Internet Explorer. I use Firefox for it’s safety, I don’t want to have some fucktard looser trying to scam me through a java applet, or a small “harmless” ad, so I use NoScript and Adblock.</p>
<p>Oh, about theft. Really, if I could meet these people in real life, I would just fucking kill them. How the HELL would “you visited my website whilst blocking advertisements” stand up in court?

Yeh, Opera is about as good as firefox, but FireFox’s extensions beats Opera’s by a mile.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Why is that?  Offer proof please?</p>
<p>Popular Fx extensions, such as Adblock, Mouse Gestures, etc., are included in Opera.  Not to mention Opera also has their own site for ‘extensions.’ <a href="http://widgets.opera.com/%5B/quote%5D" rel="nofollow noopener">http://widgets.opera.com/[/quote]</a><br>
Yeh, I know the widgets.<br>
but firefox has like more, and betta themes.<br>
but that’s just my opinion  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/cool.png?v=6" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"></p>

<p>Why is that?  Offer proof please?</p>
<p>Popular Fx extensions, such as Adblock, Mouse Gestures, etc., are included in Opera.  Not to mention Opera also has their own site for ‘extensions.’ <a href="http://widgets.opera.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://widgets.opera.com/</a></p>

<p>Last time I checked, Google Ads don’t have spyware.  And the sitehost is blocked by AdBlock anyway.  And apparently you don’t understand the point.  The point is that Mozilla refuses to let site owners block users with the specific plug-in.  Therefore, the only retaliation would be to block all Firefox users.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s my point. What if I WANT to block those annoying “Click here get a free IPOD*” ads that do nothing but flash from black and white and try to put me into a seizure?</p>
<p>I personally do use the ABP plugin, and I have found that browsing the internet is MUCH more tolerable than it was before. I can’t stand all of those flash in the face, play sound, fancy Flash ads that slow the rest of the site down. No, I will not right click and turn the quality to low. I will block them.</p>
<p>I refuse to let them intrude onto my peaceful browsing experience by forcing ads onto me.</p>

<blockquote>[font=Century Gothic][size=20pt]You've reached this page because the site you were trying to visit now blocks the FireFox browser. [/size]
<p>[size=10pt][b]The Mozilla Foundation and its Commercial arm, the Mozilla Corporation, has allowed and endorsed Ad Block Plus, a plug-in that blocks advertisement on web sites and also prevents site owners from blocking people using it. Software that blocks all advertisement is an infringement of the rights of web site owners and developers. Numerous web sites exist in order to provide quality content in exchange for displaying ads. Accessing the content while blocking the ads, therefore would be no less than stealing. Millions of hard working people are being robbed of their time and effort by this type of software.  Many site owners therefore install scripts that prevent people using ad blocking software from accessing their site. That is their right as the site owner to insist that the use of their resources accompanies the presence of the ads.</p>
<p>While blanket ad blocking in general is still theft, the real problem is Ad Block Plus’s unwillingness to allow individual site owners the freedom to block people using their plug-in. Blocking FireFox is the only alternative. Demographics have shown that not only are FireFox users a somewhat small percentage of the internet, they actually are even smaller in terms of online spending, therefore blocking FireFox seems to have only minimal financial drawbacks, whereas ending resource theft has tremendous financial rewards for honest, hard-working website owners and developers…</p>
<p>Since the makers of Ad Block Plus as well as the filter subscriptions that accompany it refuse to allow website owners control over their own intellectual property, and since FireFox actively endorses Ad Block Plus, the sites linking to this page are now blocking FireFox until the resource theft is stopped.</p>
<p>Netscape users can simply set their browser to IE mode to continue to enjoy the site that sent you here. FireFox users can use Internet Explorer, Opera or Netscape (in IE mode) to access it. FireFox users also have the option of using the IE Tab plug-in which uses the IE rendering engine to display pages, but also disables the Ad Block Plus plug-in.</p>
<p>If you are offended by the Mozilla Corporation’s endorsement of dishonesty please contact the Mozilla Foundation and ask them to stop empowering internet theft.[/b][/size][/font]</p>

<p>Thoughts?  I’d personally never block Firefox, but it does raise a valid point.</p>
