    <title>Xfire SERVER HELP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/xfire-server-help/23124</link>
    <description>Anyone on the forums who has xfire and is willing to help me with my server, or even if you just have advice, please post... I&#39;ll need some instant messenger contact so I won&#39;t end up with fifty unnecessary posts. There are a few specific things that i need help with, that aren&#39;t able to be quickly solved using this forum at the moment. TY if you help or post. 
                                     I want to start a group of xfire users who can all help each-other and other people on the forums who need help
Email= kayauts@yahoo.com
Xfire= Kayauts (will show up as Лорд пирога)
AIM= kayauts (Note: I do not use AIM very often)


(server is &quot;kayautscape.no-ip.org&quot;) Not usually up, but will be after some issues have been worked out.</description>
