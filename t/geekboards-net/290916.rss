    <description>I have been reccomended this forum/blog hosting site: Geekboards.net by many people and i think it would be a perfect site for hosting your clan forum? I am trying to help users out here by passing on information...

They offer forums:
SMF(Being updated),IPB,MyBB,PHPBB

Blogs:
Wordpress

Its like smfforfree etc.. but it has much less users(your site goes faster),doesnt slow your site by putting a forum on your site, Unlimited bandwidth limit.
More advantages on the main page.

From another forum user:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This system is amazing!!!!! It even has daily backups unlike some other places, i hope everyone enjoys this site as much as i do. From Dave&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
