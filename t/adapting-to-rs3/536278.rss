    <title>Adapting to RS3?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adapting-to-rs3/536278</link>
    <description>So I haven&#39;t played neither have I logged on to RuneScape for pretty much this whole year and just today I found out it finally made the transition to the awaited &quot;RuneScape 3&quot;.

I feel like playing this game again, but after seeing all these drastic changes to the UI and of course content updates and changes such as this new skill Divination and many other things, I feel really left out. I honestly had a hard time adjusting the screen size in resizable mode back to showing fully, turns out I had classic preset enabled.  :palm:

Anyways, I just want to ask if the game is still worth playing. Are the bots gone? Is the economy good as in making money decently and being able to afford items?

The reason I&#39;m in this dilemma is because I&#39;ve put so much hard work into my account in the previous years that I&#39;m near to more than half way in maxing out and I don&#39;t feel like abandoning the work put into all this because I&#39;m actually considering playing the Oldschool version due to having trouble adjusting myself to these drastic changes but as I mentioned above, I don&#39;t feel like abandoning what I haven&#39;t finished.

In your opinions, is it still worth playing this game or I should start playing the oldschool variant. The game looks so complicated now. :P</description>

              <p>[quote=“kickingjamie, post:10, topic:536278”]I played some runescape 3 over the weekend and I have to say I found it very difficult to adapt to the new interfaces and the combat. Keep in mind I had not played runescape since pre eoc.</p>
<p>I think that the new systems they have are aimed at the hardcore gamers who can afford to buy large dual screens and powerful computers. When I first logged in I struggled to find my inventory and then spent around 10minutes trying to figure out my own combat level-since 138 was no longer maximum. I really think that the new interfaces are daunting and very messy. By messy I mean things are cramped together in way that it is very hard to find small things you need, for example I was trying to kill frost dragons and wanted to know how long my war tortoise had left - I could not for the life of me find where the timer was. Now, I noticed at times interfaces would often overlay another making them difficult to read- for example I did some dungeoneering and the interface showing keys was right where my ability bar was. Yes I know I can move the ability bar but that isn’t the point. Onto the customisability of the interfaces in terms of where it is on screen, I personally think that this is a great idea and had it been done on the pre update interface it would have been great but the fact it’s on the new system hinders its greatness.</p>
<p>As for the combat lets just say it confused me at first and then I realised that if you just spam abilities you should be good which obviously is not a good system. Lets just say I don’t like combat system and didn’t enjoy playing with it. I also want to mention the fact that protection prayers now only blocks 50% of damage which to me feels stupid.</p>
<p>I think the only reason I really had any enjoyment from trying runescape 3 was because I was dungeoneering most of the time which was always one of my favourite skills. All in all I think the game is to complicated, to messy and broken. I also would hate to be a brand new player as everything is so daunting. It isn’t worth playing, you’d be better of on osrs.</p>
<p>(excuse any misspelled shit or typo’s I types this on my phone)[/quote]<br>
For your Dungeoneering interface problem, you can actually move those interfaces. I believe that interfaces like that, are the minigame interface. You can move all of that stuff around by going into edit mode. Also, if you click the little RS3 button, there’s a tab on that interface that explains the entire UI and how it works/how you can edit/change it. It honestly doesn’t take long to get adjusted to it if you really try. I’m not sure how easy/hard it is for you to get adjusted to new things, but for me, I was adjusted to it within 15 minutes with the occasional question about where an interface is located at. But that was also during the NIS alpha where some things were different/not added.</p>
<p>For combat, you don’t need to spam click the abilities unless you really want to try and do combos. Monsters now have weaknesses and strong points and requires you to wear/use appropriate armor/weapons. It actually requires your attention to fight something rather than afk’ing something like a slayer task.</p>

<p>What do you mean by it stacks the inventory, skills, etc.? If you mean that by dragging and dropping an interface onto another one, it adds a tab at the top of the interface.</p>
<p>And honestly, it isn’t all that complicated. It’ll take about 20-30 minutes or less to understand it.</p>

Everything is movable and out of place. Instead of pressing on a tab and have the interface open in it’s default spot, you keep getting new windows popping out.</p>

              <p>So I haven’t played neither have I logged on to RuneScape for pretty much this whole year and just today I found out it finally made the transition to the awaited “RuneScape 3”.</p>
<p>I feel like playing this game again, but after seeing all these drastic changes to the UI and of course content updates and changes such as this new skill Divination and many other things, I feel really left out. I honestly had a hard time adjusting the screen size in resizable mode back to showing fully, turns out I had classic preset enabled.  :palm:</p>
<p>Anyways, I just want to ask if the game is still worth playing. Are the bots gone? Is the economy good as in making money decently and being able to afford items?</p>
<p>The reason I’m in this dilemma is because I’ve put so much hard work into my account in the previous years that I’m near to more than half way in maxing out and I don’t feel like abandoning the work put into all this because I’m actually considering playing the Oldschool version due to having trouble adjusting myself to these drastic changes but as I mentioned above, I don’t feel like abandoning what I haven’t finished.</p>
<p>In your opinions, is it still worth playing this game or I should start playing the oldschool variant. The game looks so complicated now. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
