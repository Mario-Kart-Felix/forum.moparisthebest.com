&lt;blockquote&gt;Players who enter a PvP or Bounty World will now automatically become skulled and unable to use the Protect Item prayer. The skull will not disappear over time or when a player dies, unless they go to a non-PvP world, in which case the skull behaves like normal. Note that this means you will always lose everything you are carrying if you get killed by another player, and that there is no way for you to keep any items on death while in a PvP or Bounty World.

Additionally, on members’ worlds, your victims must now lose at least 75,000 coins’ worth of items (increased from 25,000) for your earning potential to be applied to the drop. On free-to-play worlds, the amount the victim must lose remains at 25,000 coins.

Please note that you will have to be in a safe area before you can next log into a PvP or Bounty World. You will need to log into a non-PvP/Bounty World in order to move to a safe area. This is to ensure nobody logs in risking more than they are aware of. A message will explain this on login if you try to enter these worlds. This only applies to your next PvP/Bounty World login; from then on, you will be able to log in as normal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It&#39;s good if you are one of those people who never die, but if you&#39;re one of those people who likes to PK, and always dies, you won&#39;t be able to protect your whip, godsword or whatever.

              <p>idm this update, i pk quite often i only safe my whip just cause im on a budget atm, but wow this crashed econamy TOO bad?</p>
<p>sure brings back old school pking but all those nerd pures who get like 50m+ and no life skills are gunna bitch about not beingable to use items, but least jagex could have done was up drops a tad if they planned on this, and the other thing, does te 75k limit apply to peopl under 60 cb or w.e still? :0</p>
<p>jagex made a good and bad move, 1 they somewhat brang old pking back, 2 they crashed econamy good for some people waiting to invest in items that just sky rocketed e.g bandos armour, and ags, but bad for the people who invested b4 this update, e.g ags is selling 30m+50m junk in w 2 &gt;.&gt;</p>

<p>It’s funny actually, the new system just makes it easy as shit to make money now. I pk for about 2 hours when I get home from work, I drop about 15-25 people depending on if I’m messing around or not. Each drop has a couple rune items, 60k and other various things. I risk 300k, so that’s probably why. I hardly die. I’ve only died once this week and that’s because someone pjed a death match between my target and I and we both were out.</p>

Basically, this means that P2P is going to be full of whip/dds, correct? With being skulled ALL the time and not being able to use prot. item, I don’t think people(unless rich) are going to risk an AGS or d claws. This will also cause AGS and d claws to crash in price…that’s okay though.<br>

nah, the update is a good thing for the good rushers, since they won’t die unless they get trapped, and they’ll just pray most of the time anyway.[/quote]</p>
<p>They’ll just get raped by 1 itemers before they can do anything since they’ll be in good gear.</p>

The point of PKing is to gain items. If you don’t risk something, you don’t gain anything. No risk, no gain.</p>

<blockquote>Players who enter a PvP or Bounty World will now automatically become skulled and unable to use the Protect Item prayer. The skull will not disappear over time or when a player dies, unless they go to a non-PvP world, in which case the skull behaves like normal. Note that this means you will always lose everything you are carrying if you get killed by another player, and that there is no way for you to keep any items on death while in a PvP or Bounty World.
<p>Additionally, on members’ worlds, your victims must now lose at least 75,000 coins’ worth of items (increased from 25,000) for your earning potential to be applied to the drop. On free-to-play worlds, the amount the victim must lose remains at 25,000 coins.</p>
<p>Please note that you will have to be in a safe area before you can next log into a PvP or Bounty World. You will need to log into a non-PvP/Bounty World in order to move to a safe area. This is to ensure nobody logs in risking more than they are aware of. A message will explain this on login if you try to enter these worlds. This only applies to your next PvP/Bounty World login; from then on, you will be able to log in as normal.</p>

<p>It’s good if you are one of those people who never die, but if you’re one of those people who likes to PK, and always dies, you won’t be able to protect your whip, godsword or whatever.</p>
