So the [url=http://www.worldscapeblitz.com/blitz/smf/index.php/topic,14276.msg125401.html#msg125401]first post[/url] was a bit lame and overly descriptive, I&#39;ll try and spice this one up more. Case in point though, I&#39;m getting back into the same project if anyone&#39;s interested in helping/observing.

[spoiler=Game Launcher]
This is the screen that first pops up when launching the game:
[img]http://i.imgur.com/ckckalf.png[/img]
[/spoiler]

The name of the game has been &quot;Zionus&quot;, it&#39;s stupid and meaningless but it&#39;s what I came up with awhile back. Certainly subject to change.

[hr][hr][hr]

Here&#39;s a basic idea of what I&#39;ve got so far...


[spoiler=General Preview]
These graphics are temporary, but here&#39;s how the game looks (size reduced by 33%):
[img width=1280 height=720]http://i.imgur.com/VxbPvQB.png[/img]
[/spoiler]

[b][size=14pt]Key existing features of the game:[/size][/b]

[ul][li]Entire game engine coded completely from scratch (graphics and mechanics)[/li]
[li]2D RPG top-down game[/li]
[li]Game launcher that&#39;s f*cking epic[/li]
[li]Music/sound system[/li]
[li]Custom mouse cursor[/li]
[li]In-game pause menu[/li]
[li]NPC AI support with dialogues[/li]
[li]Basic player walking/firing projectiles (with clipping and collision for both)[/li]
[li]Working level design system[/li]
[li]Maybe MMO soon, currently single player only[/li]
[li]Currently making it into a medieval style RPG, up for suggestions on maybe a shooter game or changing up the theme[/li][/ul]


[spoiler=NPC Dialogue]
Here&#39;s what dialogues with NPC look like (size reduced by 33%):
[img width=1280 height=720]http://i.imgur.com/2jgkvrg.png[/img]
[/spoiler]

[b][size=14pt]Plans to add eventually:[/size][/b]

[ul][li]Draw up in-game HUD[/li]
[li]Character creation screen (*)[/li]
[li]Main menu before game (*)[/li]
[li]Multiplayer support (so many ways to go about this, and it&#39;s a maybe)[/li]
[li]Combat[/li]
[li]Skill creation/development[/li]
[li]Quests and perhaps a main story mode[/li]
[li]A LOT of graphics changes/implementations (current graphics are merely temporary)[/li][/ul]
[i][size=8pt](*) Currently being worked on[/size][/i]


[b][size=14pt]Areas in where I could use your help:[/size][/b]

[ul][li]Graphic artists (basically just drawing up sprites -- 2D images in paint, really -- for map tiles and characters)[/li]
[li]Consulting/help on more advanced programming aspects (combat and multiplayer ATM)[/li]
[li]Level/world designers[/li]
[li]Quest developers/writers[/li]
[li]Character designers[/li]
[li]Skill creators[/li]
[li]Writers for ideas for minigames/bosses[/li]
[li]&gt;&gt;Basically, not so much coding help needed, more-so on the story-writing/creative side of things, ya know? :) Should be easier for anyone wanting to contribute.[/li][/ul]


[hr][hr][hr]

**Somewhat of a disclaimer: Still in the very early development stages. It may not seem like a lot now, but I plan to spend several more months on this (even if I take breaks from it now and then) so this is beyond close to finished. Not really &quot;advertising&quot; it at this point or even begging for help, just seeing if people are interested. I still have yet to make a finished game from scratch for myself, even if it is simple in its own right. So if you wanna be apart of that, even if you&#39;re barely involved, lemme know!**</description>
