    <description>Ok, theres a man/girl/boy/women whatever got mad at servers and putting in names and trying to mess servers up for example Progjex-scape.no-ip.org, port: 7965, is one of them servers being bugged by this pathetic person and has some kind of anti-ban so he/she can still play on that server(s). I personally witnessed it over ten times on many servers ecspecially Progjex-scape. Thee ip of the error person (once again he or she) is &quot; adsl-75-47-129-167.dsl.lsan03.sbcglobal.net &quot;. If there is anyway you can permantly ban him from Moparscape than I would more than likely enjoy it or if you could find out how to ipban him/her from progjex-scape.no-ip.org because &quot;Owner Fellixmbc (aka Archer) also is getting annoyed by it.  

Thanks much,
