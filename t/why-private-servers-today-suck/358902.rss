    <title>Why Private Servers today Suck</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-private-servers-today-suck/358902</link>
    <description>Disclaimer: This isn&#39;t a complaint about the moparscape community, so please read on before locking this thread.

Right now if you check the moparscape status page, the majority of &quot;popular&quot; servers are plain delta-scape sources with no originality except for the name. You may refer to these as &quot;Leeches&quot; or &quot;Delta-Leeches&quot;.

The general consensus among these servers, besides the poorly-written lines of code, are to extract money from the consumer(you). Many of these staff members are personal friends of the person who started the server and are often immature and often don&#39;t understand that &quot;Great Power comes with Great Responsibility&quot;- Spider Man.

This is why I disagree with the idea of paying to advertise on the moparscape status page, the only way that these servers can get their initial investment back is to constantly update their game with only one thing in mind: profit.

Any &quot;actually&quot; good servers get pushed to the side because the owner often doesn&#39;t have the resources to host/promote their server. And then the server just becomes another lost-cause.

I understand that the earnings from the status page go to support good servers that are written off bases like Hyperion and RSDaemon and 317 serv, but how many of these servers serve a practical use beside the constant awe they receive for their well-written lines of code.

It&#39;s like how part of the money from every pack of cigarettes you buy goes to health-care for kids. It really doesn&#39;t make sense.

So the question is: How do we give more incentive to the working class seasoned-java guru and less incentive to the leecher-skid that uses his parent&#39;s credit card to host/promote their pathetic excuse of a server*cough delta-leech*

I personally believe in starting a network between the real programmers and the skids that can host/promote so we get the best of both worlds (ideally). Of course moparscape could get a cut from this to help keep the site running, and to &quot;supposedly&quot; pay people to make good servers.

It just might not be lucrative, but then again private-servers were made in first place for fun not for profit.</description>

              <p>I agree with most of what you said, but I don’t see where you gave an idea on how to fix it, which is what is needed.  If you have an idea I’d be more than happy to hear it.</p>

<p>The reason why Private Servers suck today, is because they find a source. And they look at tutorials on how to do it. People have no idea where to start, when it comes to research, and doing it proper. Ya we have Hyperion, rs377d, and sites like RuneWiki, and information on what means what. But when you start ACTUALLY getting down to the serious stuff, you don’t know where to look, and people are WAY to ignorant to help you.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The information is out there and it is possible to use it without help by figuring it out yourself. How do you think servers like winterlove and rs377d got made in the first place? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>It does help if you can program first though. Many people here haven’t really got the right skills for programming (logic, problem solving, maths, whatever) and if we didn’t have the winterlove mess (but instead had a modular, scriptable server) would either be writing scripts or downloading them.</p>
<p>I’m currently writing Apollo (some of you who visit rune server and google have probably heard of it) which is basically Hyperion version 2. It has a much better way of implementing the game scripts and packet/event handling (inspired by the many discussions in the moparscape vet board) which will hopefully solve that problem. The core server is coming along nicely, so soon I’ll be writing content plugins (mining, fishing, woodcutting, etc). When (and if) I ever finish it I am hoping to enter it for mopar’s payment thingy and release it open source :). The goal is for people to simply to be able to download plugins through a system like a linux package manager and fill out a configuration file with their server name/info.</p>
<p>Yes some people will probably moan about ‘oh it is easy for leechers like that’ but I don’t really care. That kind of attitude (keeping stuff to yourself) has harmed server development imho and we are in the current state with a load of crap here instead of a proper, stable server which actually works. I only ever started writing my own servers (like Apollo, Hyperion, rs2hd, Shard) because I just wanted a decent server for me and friends (and of course, no decent servers existed). If one had I probably wouldn’t be involved and would probably forgotten all about RuneScape private servers by now :p.</p>
<p>Anyway I have realised I am going way too off-topic and after re-reading have realised that some doesn’t make that much sense (and promoting Apollo like that sounds like moparisthebest promoting Cherokee :P)… but basically yes I agree in general with the points made by most people in this thread.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Sounds good, I’m looking forward to it being completed so I can finally pay someone for a great server, make sure to let me know via PM when it’s ready. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

I prefer the second one, since there used to be a variety and after you maxed on one, you went on another server to find more creativity and repeat the cycle for different rewards.</p>

              <p>Hm, I wonder when the time will come when there will be a stable and reliable source to use, that is extremely easy to edit (talking, as easy as creating things on Delta is). No, I am not saying I support delta, or that I like it, but I find it extremely easy to edit. It’s just a shame that the stability and reliability isn’t as up-to-date with many modern servers.</p>
<p>Anyhow, anybody got any source suggestions for me to use as a base for my server?</p>
<p>P.S: Yes, I already know about stable and reliable sources like Hyperion, so if you were smart and understood this post, you wouldn’t flame me.</p>

<p>The reason why Private Servers suck today, is because they find a source. And they look at tutorials on how to do it. People have no idea where to start, when it comes to research, and doing it proper. Ya we have Hyperion, rs377d, and sites like RuneWiki, and information on what means what. But when you start ACTUALLY getting down to the serious stuff, you don’t know where to look, and people are WAY to ignorant to help you.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The information is out there and it is possible to use it without help by figuring it out yourself. How do you think servers like winterlove and rs377d got made in the first place? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>It does help if you can program first though. Many people here haven’t really got the right skills for programming (logic, problem solving, maths, whatever) and if we didn’t have the winterlove mess (but instead had a modular, scriptable server) would either be writing scripts or downloading them.</p>
<p>I’m currently writing Apollo (some of you who visit rune server and rune locus have probably heard of it) which is basically Hyperion version 2. It has a much better way of implementing the game scripts and packet/event handling (inspired by the many discussions in the moparscape vet board) which will hopefully solve that problem. The core server is coming along nicely, so soon I’ll be writing content plugins (mining, fishing, woodcutting, etc). When (and if) I ever finish it I am hoping to enter it for mopar’s payment thingy and release it open source :). The goal is for people to simply to be able to download plugins through a system like a linux package manager and fill out a configuration file with their server name/info.</p>
<p>Yes some people will probably moan about ‘oh it is easy for leechers like that’ but I don’t really care. That kind of attitude (keeping stuff to yourself) has harmed server development imho and we are in the current state with a load of crap here instead of a proper, stable server which actually works. I only ever started writing my own servers (like Apollo, Hyperion, rs2hd, Shard) because I just wanted a decent server for me and friends (and of course, no decent servers existed). If one had I probably wouldn’t be involved and would probably forgotten all about RuneScape private servers by now :p.</p>
<p>Anyway I have realised I am going way too off-topic and after re-reading have realised that some doesn’t make that much sense (and promoting Apollo like that sounds like moparisthebest promoting Cherokee :P)… but basically yes I agree in general with the points made by most people in this thread.</p>

<p>This has been on my mind for ages, and your points are completely true. Good servers do get pushed to the back, and only those rich little brats with their mom’s credit card get to buy a virtual dedicated server and actually get far with their server. This wouldn’t be so bad in most cases, but everyone uses the SAME FUCKING SERVER without actually adding any new content. What’s funny is all those servers have screenshots showing off “features” like killing rock crabs, shitty pest control, PKing, and other crap that was already there in the first place. Hopefully the retards who play these servers are eventually going to realize what they’re wasting their time and money on.</p>
