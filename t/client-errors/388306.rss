    <title>Client Errors</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-errors/388306</link>
    <description>If i don&#39;t put the DSPK file into my C-Drive it just creates a DSPK file which doesn&#39;t have any of the files in it that the client requires. I have to replace the DSPK file it automatically makes with the propper one for the client to work otherwise i get 6 errors (Picture of these errors in the first link below). How can i make it so people dont need to manually add the working DSPK file and to maybe make it automatically add the correct file?

Look at these they should help..
