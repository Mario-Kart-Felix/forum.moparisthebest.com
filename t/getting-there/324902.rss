<p>The American constitution, much like Australian’s constitution, delegates law making powers in various areas to the federal government and state government.<br>
For example, in Western Australia radar detectors (which are used to detect police radar) are perfectly legal to own and use. This isn’t the case in any other state. Now our federal government couldn’t come in and legislate with regards to this to introduce uniformity because they aren’t legally allowed to, as per our constitution (which grants the power of law making with regards to roads and transit to the state governments).<br>
If, against all odds, the Australian government did try to legislate in such an area then the state governments <span class="bbcode-b">wouldn’t have to enforce it</span>, because the federal legislation is unconstitutional. However they <em>may</em> choose to enforce it anyway, but that would be at their discretion.</p>

Pretty sure, the Feds have to abide with the constitution with whatever they do. And everything that falls outside of<br>
the constitution is up for the states to decide. Like drug legalization. And Federal Law is always above State law.<br>
So saying States don’t have to enforce Federal laws is wrong.</p>
<p>Also sure there are medical marijuana dispensaries, but does that doesn’t mean everyone in there has permission<br>
to use and posses the marijuana. So DEA raids might be legal. I actually did some research on this and even though<br>
no one was arrested, the DEA did confiscate the marijuana which is wrong IMO.<br>

Please leave the political discussions to people who actually know even a little bit about the subject. Thanks.[/quote]</p>

<p>You’re basically right, except the Feds decided that personal consumption of drugs is a matter of restricting trade, because drugs can be carried across state lines. How that means they can regulate personal consumption I dunno, you’d have to ask them or a lawyer ;/[/quote]</p>
<p>NO no no, you ask unhandled cause he knows all about this.</p>

<p>You’re basically right, except the Feds decided that personal consumption of drugs is a matter of restricting trade, because drugs can be carried across state lines. How that means they can regulate personal consumption I dunno, you’d have to ask them or a lawyer ;/</p>

<p>I agree with that, the problem is where it’s not spelled out what the federal government can do where states are concerned they both want to make laws about the issue.  The state can always bring the issue before the federal supreme court and get the law declared unconstitutional though, which is what would have to happen to clear the whole thing up.</p>

It’s stupid they bring up Amsterdam, as if it’s not tolerated anywhere else in the netherlands.</p>

<p>States dont have to enforce federal law.  If this gets legalized then no state cop can arrest you, only fbi etc.</p>

<p>really doubt it works like that…<br>
[/quote]<br>
That’s exactly how it works…In California, it’s currently legal to run a medical marijuana dispensary, according to <span class="bbcode-b">state</span> law. Now <span class="bbcode-b">federal</span> law still says it’s illegal to possess marijuana, so the DEA, a <span class="bbcode-b">federal</span> agency, has been raiding these dispensaries, despite them being perfectly legal according to state law. Obama recently told the DEA to leave them alone, so I assume these raids have stopped, despite running a dispensary still being illegal according to federal law.[/quote]<br>
Correct. It’s good to see an aspect of U.S. government where federalism is still practiced.</p>
