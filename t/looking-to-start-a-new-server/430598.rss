    <title>Looking to start a new server!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-to-start-a-new-server/430598</link>
    <description>Hello,

[b]Introduction:[/b] 
I know what your thinking... This guy just joined, right? Well I did. I joined for the pure factor that I have been trying to find a good source to use and have came up empty. I now want to develop my own server, so that it will be the best it can be. I&#39;ve played all the good sources and leveled up, been ranked up, and been rich in a few. But that&#39;s beside the point... I&#39;m looking to start my own development team and website and watch it grow!

[b]About me:[/b] 
I&#39;ve been playing private servers for a few years now and have developed a few servers, all of which werent that great, but back in the day, I had 35+ players on my server. I&#39;m 18. I&#39;m a manager at my place of work and I believe hard work pays off. 

[b]What I&#39;m looking for:[/b] 
I&#39;m looking for experianced coders to help me code a server, client, and forums.

[b]Tell me about yourself: [/b] 
How old are you?
Do you have a job?
What do you like to do for fun?
Why would you like to join my development team?
How many years have you coded?
What coding languages do you know?
Can you work with a team?</description>
