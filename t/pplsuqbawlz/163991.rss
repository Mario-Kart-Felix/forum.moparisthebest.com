    <title>Pplsuqbawlz?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pplsuqbawlz/163991</link>
    <description>First you all call me a conspiracy nut but i have revealed more things then anyone else.  Also alot of my suspious about people that i was unable to prove have become provable over time.

Data Collect:
http://www.rscheata.net/ppl/

Main points:
runeown releases a nexus script that steals rs accts.
Both &#39;Zymic&#39; and &#39;pplsuqbawlz&#39; recommend runeown be contrbuted,  Both post from the same ip.
http://www.rscheata.net/ppl/10.jpg
Zymic is one of the original members of Fagex and is banned for keylogging.

http://www.rscheata.net/ppl/2.jpg
http://www.rscheata.net/ppl/1.jpg


Suspicious facts:
pplsuqbawlz uses a different IP at every site.
semaphore posted 3min after pplsuqbawlz today.
pplsuqbawlz got his accts back.
pplsuqbawlz says he let other people on his accts.


Probability of this happening is very small.  For pplsuqballz to be innocent by all accounts it would be very low-probability turn of events.  For someone to have access to pplsuqballz accts for over 6 months without pplsuqballz knowing????</description>

<p>I think it is quite clear that psb sees Semaphore as a mentor figure. From what i know, psb has great respect for him and his abilities.</p>

<p>Anything that he has said has had supporting evidence. His posts are a clear indication of his level of knowledge. Even though he may have a condescending attitude at times, why should he not? I mean, he knows a lot more than the majority of the community.</p>

<p>i get the feeling pplsuqbawlz treats everything like a race, where he has to be in pole position, take this extract from IM, (not completely accurate as im writing from memory)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">pplsuqbawlz: Im playing around with wurm online

pplsuqbawlz: LoL im soo far ahead of all you guys</code></pre>
<p>FFS im not even trying to do anything with wurm online, how can you be far ahead of me if im not ever travelling in the same direction as you!?^$%^</p>
<p>^ but i didnt say that cause it was the first-or-second time i spoke to him and i didnt know much about him.<br>

              <p>First you all call me a conspiracy nut but i have revealed more things then anyone else.  Also alot of my suspious about people that i was unable to prove have become provable over time.</p>
<p>Data Collect:<br>
<a href="http://www.rscheata.net/ppl/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.rscheata.net/ppl/</a></p>
<p>Main points:<br>
runeown releases a nexus script that steals rs accts.<br>
Both ‘Zymic’ and ‘pplsuqbawlz’ recommend runeown be contrbuted,  Both post from the same ip.<br>
<a href="http://www.rscheata.net/ppl/10.jpg" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.rscheata.net/ppl/10.jpg</a><br>
Zymic is one of the original members of Fagex and is banned for keylogging.</p>

<a href="http://www.rscheata.net/ppl/1.jpg" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.rscheata.net/ppl/1.jpg</a></p>
<p>Suspicious facts:<br>
pplsuqbawlz uses a different IP at every site.<br>
semaphore posted 3min after pplsuqbawlz today.<br>
pplsuqbawlz got his accts back.<br>
pplsuqbawlz says he let other people on his accts.</p>
<p>Probability of this happening is very small.  For pplsuqballz to be innocent by all accounts it would be very low-probability turn of events.  For someone to have access to pplsuqballz accts for over 6 months without pplsuqballz knowing???</p>
