    <title>[PI] how to make your own commands [noobs]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-how-to-make-your-own-commands-noobs/398647</link>
    <description>ok so ill just start the tutorial i will be explaining how to make a command for project insanity beginners since it is such a popular source now.
every basic command starts with either:
[code]
- if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;funpk&quot;)) {
or 
- if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;funpk&quot;)) {
[/code]
the first example means that the command will only be performed if the users text matches the command exactly, the second one if the text begins with the command (i could type ::funpkwhatsupmyniggers and it would yield the same result) 

so if your command requires a player name or integer after it, use startswith, otherwise, use equalsignorecase

 for example ::godown (down a height level) and ::god both start with ::god and they could both be activated if you typed ::godown if you were using startsWith for god command.

you can add other things into the first line to determine who is allowed to use the command, for a player with rights equal or greater than 2 

&amp;&amp; and (must be true)
|| or
//  comment line, ignored by the compiler
!=   does not equal
+= plus
-= minus
== equals (verb) if(playercommandbullshit.equals(&quot;fuckme&quot;){
c.isDonator ==1;
}
= equals - for example if(a = 1){
}
/* ignored text */ = comment out any amount of code or text
remember to always put &quot;;&quot; semicolon at the end of a line of code that does not have a bracket

these/\ are not related to rsps, they are the same on all servers

[code] if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;funpk&quot;) &amp;&amp; c.playerRights &gt; 2) {[/code]
for either a staff member or a donator, [code]if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;funpk&quot;) &amp;&amp; c.playerRights &gt; 2 || c.isDonator &gt;=1) {[/code]
remember these variables playerRights and isDonator are must be declared in your server, they are not universal.

anyways now for what comes inside your command. 
many commands have a synatx such as [code]::item #### ####[/code]
for these commands there are several ways of organizing them
[code]			
if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;ipmute&quot;)) {
				try {	
					String playerToBan = playerCommand.substring(7);// the variable playertoban is the text entered 7 spaces after the name of the command
					for(int i = 0; i &lt; Config.MAX_PLAYERS; i++) {//gets the players
						if(Server.playerHandler.players[i] != null) {//if the player is online continue
							if(Server.playerHandler.players[i].playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(playerToBan)) {//this makes sure only the player named in the command will be banned
								Connection.addIpToMuteList(Server.playerHandler.players[i].connectedFrom);
								c.sendMessage(&quot;You have IP Muted the user: &quot;+Server.playerHandler.players[i].playerName);
								Client c2 = (Client)Server.playerHandler.players[i];
								c2.sendMessage(&quot;You have been muted by: &quot; + c.playerName);
								c2.sendMessage(&quot; &quot; +c2.playerName+ &quot; Got IpMuted By &quot; + c.playerName+ &quot;.&quot;);
								break;
							} 
						}
					}
				} catch(Exception e) {
					c.sendMessage(&quot;Player Must Be Offline.&quot;); //catch exception always at the end of a command with try{
				}	
				}//remember for every open bracket there must be a closed bracket
[/code]
and for an integer
[code]			
if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;combat&quot;) &amp;&amp; c.playerRights &gt; 2) {//playerRights greater than 2
				try  {
					String[] args = playerCommand.split(&quot; &quot;);//command splits after the space
					c.newCombat = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);//variable newCombat equals the integer in the command
					c.newCmb = true;//sets the combat level, this method is not located in the commands.java though
					c.updateRequired = true;//for use when a command affects player appearance 
					c.setAppearanceUpdateRequired(true);//for use when a command affects player appearance 
				} catch (Exception e) {//i told you every time..
				}
			}
[/code]
to make a command affect one player, use
[code]				
try {	
					String playerTofuck = playerCommand.substring(HOWEVER LONG YOUR COMMAND NAME IS, PLUS 1);
					for(int i = 0; i &lt; Config.MAX_PLAYERS; i++) {
						if(Server.playerHandler.players[i] != null) {
							if(Server.playerHandler.players[i].playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(playerTofuck)) {
//explained earlier
[/code]
for it to affect all players, like a hail command or something, simply use
[code]				for (int j = 0; j &lt; Server.playerHandler.players.length; j++) {
					if (Server.playerHandler.players[j] != null) {
[/code]

some other useful methods:

[ul][li]c.getItems().addItem(ITEMID, AMOUNT);[/li]
[li]c.sendMessage(&quot;TEXT GOES HERE&quot;);[/li]
[li]c.getPA().sendFrame126(&quot;www.URL-GOES-HERE.com&quot;, 12000);[/li]
[li]c.gfx0(GFXID);[/li]
[li]c.startAnimation(ANIMID / EMOTEID);[/li]
[li]c.logout();[/li][/ul]

this is useful when you want a random action to happen, basically it chooses a random number between 0-10 in this case and you make if then statements, for example
int randomText = Misc.random(10);
if(randomText != 0) {
c.issomething = true;
}
some commands i made
[code]
if(playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;randomanim&quot;)) {
int randomText = Misc.random(10);
if(randomText == 0) {
c.startAnimation(2239);
} else if(randomText == 1) {
c.startAnimation(1125);
} else if(randomText == 2) {
c.startAnimation(1115);
} else if(randomText == 3) {
c.startAnimation(2756);
} else if(randomText == 4) {
c.startAnimation(3068);
} else if(randomText == 5) {
c.startAnimation(3094);
} else if(randomText == 6) {
c.startAnimation(1835);
} else if(randomText == 7) {
c.startAnimation(505);
} else if(randomText == 8) {
c.startAnimation(837);
} else if(randomText == 9) {
c.startAnimation(1770);
} else if(randomText == 10) {
c.startAnimation(1765);
}
}

		if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;drunk&quot;)) { //havent tested this one yet!!
			if (c.playerStandIndex != 3040) {
				c.startAnimation(1329);
				c.playerStandIndex = 3040;
				c.playerTurnIndex = 2770;
				c.playerWalkIndex = 3039;
				c.playerTurn180Index = 3039;
				c.playerTurn90CWIndex = 3040;
				c.playerTurn90CCWIndex = 3040;
				c.playerRunIndex = 2770;
				c.updateRequired = true;
				c.appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
				c.sendMessage(&quot;Charlie Scheen mode activated.&quot;);
			} else {
				c.playerStandIndex = 0x328;
				c.playerTurnIndex = 0x337;
				c.playerWalkIndex = 0x333;
				c.playerTurn180Index = 0x334;
				c.playerTurn90CWIndex = 0x335;
				c.playerTurn90CCWIndex = 0x336;
				c.playerRunIndex = 0x338;
				c.updateRequired = true;
				c.appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
				c.sendMessage(&quot;Your going to have a bad hangover buddy!&quot;);
			}
		}

if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;runes&quot;) &amp;&amp; c.playerRights &gt;= 2) {
c.getItems().addItem(565, 6000);//adds runes to inventory
c.getItems().addItem(560, 8000);
c.getItems().addItem(555, 10000);
c.getItems().addItem(9075, 9000);
c.getItems().addItem(557, 9000);
}


if(playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;alert&quot;)) {//only works if you have the new alert system
				for (int j = 0; j &lt; Server.playerHandler.players.length; j++) {
					if (Server.playerHandler.players[j] != null) {
						Client c2 = (Client)Server.playerHandler.players[j];
c2.sendMessage(&quot;Alert##text ##&quot; + c.playerName + &quot;: &quot; + Misc.optimizeText(playerCommand.substring(6)) + &quot;.##text&quot;);
}
}
}



         if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;forums&quot;)) {
			c.getPA().sendFrame126(&quot;www.fighterscape.co.cc&quot;, 12000);
}
//opens a website, change the URL
[/code]


thats all, hopes this helps some people who are very new to RSPS  :D</description>
