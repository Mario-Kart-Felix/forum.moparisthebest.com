    <title>Is mopar supposed to do this?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-mopar-supposed-to-do-this/102533</link>
    <description>When I&#39;m in the game, there is no one there, but that doesn&#39;t surprise me, and when I click on something, like a superpot, it says nothing happened, like it does in normal when you use something with something else.  And when I try to open a door, or something like that, I can&#39;t, and when I try to get to kalphite, there is no way into the tunnel...  Can someone tell me why this is.

Oh, and if anyone has a server they&#39;d like me to join, just tell me it. =)

-Thanks</description>
