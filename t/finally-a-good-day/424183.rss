    <title>Finally a Good day</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/finally-a-good-day/424183</link>
    <description>I just wanted to share this because I had a good day today which is rare for me lately.

Ok, so I&#39;m depressed over a lot of family issues and deaths of friends recently, most of you know that, so today I thought I would pick up smoking cigs again for something to get my mind off it. I was sitting at the park around 7Pm and it was dark and I had a pack of cigs and I smoked 3, I was really stressing out, and on top of that my medications for panic attacks ran out before I could get a refill. So I&#39;m sitting there and I see this little black lab, maybe 5 months old at the most, whimpering around outside, around it&#39;s neck is a broken leash, mind you these are like 20 degree F weather near me and it comes up to me. I read the address where his owners were off the leash and ended up bringing the little guy to his home after warming him up for a few minutes at my house with a towel and when I got to the front door I rang it and a little girl maybe 7 came to the door with her mom and she lit up when she saw the dog. Turns out it had been missing for 2 days wandering off on it&#39;s own (poor little puppie) but what changed my day was what the little girl did next. She saw the packed of cigs in my hoodie pocket, reached in and grabbed them and said &quot;You shouldn&#39;t smoke, it could hurt you, I don&#39;t want the person who saved my doggie to get hurt.&quot;  (It was smaller words then that but that was the jist) And after that I left to walk to my car, the pack of cigs still in my pocket and I just couldn&#39;t light another. A little girl saved me from being addicted again that took me 2 years to get off last time I did.</description>
