    <title>Solar panels recycle energy?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/solar-panels-recycle-energy/535074</link>
    <description>I was wondering if for example I want to build a space ship and decide to use solar panels for the floors and have the light come from the lighting around the ship give the panels its energy to support the ship....Can this even work?  I was thinking of ways to save energy since I&#39;m on a project of designing a space ship of the future since my goal in life to get us out of this technology age since its so boring!!!!!! lol

So is it possible?  the idea came from the idea of minecraft red stone going in a circle if you have it set up in a way it goes around.</description>

<p>Lol I wouldn’t say the biggest. I don’t think there is a material that absorbs 100% of light nor do I think that is even possible haha. I think the biggest problem with his theory is that it breaks the laws of physics.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Well, it doesn’t necessarily break the laws of physics. The light would only create outward force, not actual mass, so the spaceship could exist just as regular if it had a strong enough exterior.[/quote]<br>
Using the lights inside of the ship to power the ship? That’s impossible as I stated earlier. Carnot’s theorem says a heat system can only have 100% efficiency meaning at most it can only power the lights not the ship. To power the ship would mean that it would be producing more energy than was put in meaning that it breaks the first law of thermodynamics.</p>

              <p>You want to avoid anything adding unnecessary amount of weight on the space ship. So you have to take this into consideration. Do you save weight by adding solar panels to the outside, or is it more efficient with batteries or generating electricity in another way?</p>
<p>And as people have said before, recycling energy doesn’t work. The only thing you can do is to reduce the energy usage.</p>

<p>Thanks for your answers it was a simple idea since I know for future space exploration…energy is a problem and was just a idea I was throwing out there. I’m sure it could work if new developments took place on solar panels which then the name would be alter to “something” panel?</p>

<p>It would never work as you can never have more than 100% efficiency in any heat system. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot%27s_theorem_%28thermodynamics%29" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot's_theorem_(thermodynamics)</a><br>
Like Wintercanon said, learn the laws of physics. The best you could do is to create 100% efficiency which would mean all you could do is power the lights. You would not be able to use any energy from the lights in the ship to power the ship you would need more energy than you put in which violates a law of thermodynamics.</p>

              <p>Well, it uses the same concept as a wind field near a space shuttle launch site or a bus going through a wind field tunnel.<br>
As Wintercanon said, it’s unlikely that it emits the correct spectrum of light. If you were to get it to work, it might be functional but in the end not very useful. It’s actually much more useful to just have solar panels on the outside of a ship in space as none of the light is blocked by an atmosphere. Stars would also be within logical distance at most times, though you’d still have to have fuel reserves</p>

              <p>I was wondering if for example I want to build a space ship and decide to use solar panels for the floors and have the light come from the lighting around the ship give the panels its energy to support the ship…Can this even work?  I was thinking of ways to save energy since I’m on a project of designing a space ship of the future since my goal in life to get us out of this technology age since its so boring!!! lol</p>
<p>So is it possible?  the idea came from the idea of minecraft red stone going in a circle if you have it set up in a way it goes around.</p>
