    <description>It sucks. we just got a hosting account a couple days ago. so i changed my password. i remember the first 6 chars but i cant remember the end... i entered what i thought it was but it wasnt right. will i have to go to the web host to recover the pass, or do you think my teacher will be able to reset it since he created the account?</description>
