    <title>CloudComputing and the New Age of Ram/Hard Drive Space</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cloudcomputing-and-the-new-age-of-ram-hard-drive-space/358070</link>
    <description>there have been rumors going around about new computers (mostly designed for high speed wireless internet usage) Will start connecting to servers for Ram usage and Hard Drive memory. This effect is basically used today in internet backup situations like carbonite.

 Lets give an example of what it means, take to where the user of a laptop originally has about 100gigs of storage on his/her/its computer. So now in new operating systems the cloud computing effect would play a role in this. Users could automatically connect to the operating system of their choice through an internet based selection. On the operating system would be a hard drive and amount of ram given specifically by the company who is giving the service (so basically the computer would be a client for the server being hosted abroad). Those using the computer would be able to play games and install whatever they want, and in turning off the computer a cache with a designed code would be able to save the data to the server and take up the most minimal amount of space possible. Therefore the user would have a shell containing a small, lightweight, hard drive, and the necessities such as earphone jacks and all of that, but the amount of ram and storage would only be through connection to the internet. The Ram would probably be the hardest to go by since the computer right now depends so much on it. The need for updating a computer would be cut in half, but the need of internet signals and transfers would be so large that the industry would have to in turn create more ways to get the internet signal across.

What do you guys think? It&#39;s only a rumor, but lets cross our fingers and hope for the best/worse.</description>
