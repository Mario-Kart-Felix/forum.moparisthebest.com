    <title>How do I play on different servers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-play-on-different-servers/220574</link>
    <description>Hi, I was just wondering how to switch servers. Every time I try it, it says some thing like &quot;server down&quot; or something like that. Can someone help me please? Also, if it makes any difference, I am playing on a Mac. Also, I am wondering how to play on servers that have been downloaded in the forums. If you can help me with both of these, that would be great.</description>
