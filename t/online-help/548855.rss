    <description>I&#39;m trying to get my server online, I&#39;m all portforwarded, and it says my port is successful and open! 

Problem is, 

I go into Client.java and This is what I changed.

Server = 127.0.0.1 Changed Too universaleconomy.no-ip.org

public static String server = &quot;universaleconomy.no-ip.org&quot;; &lt;---- Was this supposed to stay to 127.0.0.1 ??

Then there is this one.

if(myPrivilege == 2 || server.equals(&quot;universaleconomy.no-ip.org&quot;) || 1 == 1/*to remove*/) { Was this also supposed to stay 127.0.0.1?

NOTE: I haven&#39;t changed anything, me and my friends just want to get a server online to fool around on.


Success: I can see your service on #.#.#.# on port (43594)

Any help?</description>

Use the variable server here and not write down the address again.  This won’t help you, but not doing it is a sign of bad coding.[/quote]</p>
<p>That part of the code is actually for the owner to have access to the client sided commands. Lol. Hence why it’s checking for player rights… It has nothing to do with the server itself being online.<br>
Typically people leave it at 127.0.0.1 since they usually develop on the same machine they test on (so, locally).</p>
<p>They make sure the server ip is localhost because anyone else wouldn’t be on localhost, since they’re connected to the server…</p>
<p>Tbh, all OP should need to change is the</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>which he did.</p>
<p>And as long as you have the correct IP set for the person using it, it’d be good to go. Assuming port forwarding is done.</p>

<p>also for you to log in locally your ip on the client has to be set “127.0.0.1” for yourself</p>

</aside>
<p>Correct^. OP, if you are on the same machine as the server you must set the client’s IP to localhost.<br>
If you are on the same network, but different machine, use the LAN IP (192.168.XXX.XXX).<br>
Anyone else will use the No-IP (which is just a named version of your IP).</p>
<p>And don’t forget to have the No-IP DUC running while the server is up.</p>
