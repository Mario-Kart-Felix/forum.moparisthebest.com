    <description>[center][size=36pt]WARNING[/size]
If you prefer playing perfect, lag-free servers with no content than to a server full of content with bugs and lag, stop reading.
If you prefer playing servers loaded with &quot;custom items&quot;, &quot;custom clients&quot; and &quot;custom gameframes&quot;, stop reading.
If you prefer playing a server that will update to the latest RuneScape revision all the time, stop reading.
If you prefer playing a server where the economy is split between the elites, who joined at first opening, and the newer players, with no way of getting between classes, stop reading.
If you prefer playing a server where the owner would rather have a couple of people donating loads than everyone having fun, stop reading.

With that out the way, please feel free to read on![/center]



Well, today I was reading a thread about how people wished they could go back to the past and play easy-to-play servers such as AllStar, and how RSPS has turned into a business instead of a game, and I thought I could change it. So, here goes.

[center][size=36pt][u]Old School RSPS[/u][/size]
[size=16pt][i]Bringing back the past of MoparScape[/i][/size][/center]

[right][u]Theory[/u]
I have a theory that if I create a server that is easy to &quot;pick up and play&quot;, where the objective for the owner is not to make a profit but to have fun with his players, it will be successful. By successful, I do not mean having 500 players on at a time, I mean where everyone is happy to be there, all of the time.[/right]


[center][u]How will donations work?[/u]
I was talking to the other developer, &quot;The Unholy&quot; on these forums, on MSN, and we had an idea of how to reward donators without ruining everything - we make a reward such as &quot;If you donate $5, we will do a drop party when YOU choose!&quot; This will then reward donators, but not directly, therefore not ruining the economy.[/center]


[left][u]Development[/u]
25/02/2011 - Downloaded a blank AllStar Scape source.
25/02/2011 - Added a drop party command, something I feel is needed in a &quot;funserver&quot;.[/left]

[center][u][size=18pt]Media[/size][/u]

<p>There is a point in re-creating if the “real thing” is slapped on a pile of shit (Winterlove). Why have an inefficient server, that can barely hold a decent amount of players without using a fuck load of memory (And it’ll perform even worse after more ‘content’ is added), when you can have a nice, efficient and clean base that you can write <span class="bbcode-b">your own</span> code onto; it’s just illogical.</p>

<p>If you <span class="bbcode-i">wanted</span> to build an old style chandelier with candles, etc, you wouldn’t suddenly start using light-bulbs to make it better, would you? That wouldn’t make it an old style chandelier anymore.<br>

<p>You’ve got the wrong idea; I’m talking about efficiency, not output.</p>
<p>The reason I brought all this up was due to ranger squad, who was flaming Fridder because he suggested to use RuneSource. He could have handled it in a better manner such as “I’d rather stick with All-star, thanks.”, rather than telling him he’s retarded. You have no reason to defend him, because it was ranger squad being a prick as usual, not myself accusing him of anything that is untrue.[/quote]</p>
<p>I know what you mean, and I understand it. It’s just that it wouldn’t be right to use RuneSource, or any other new stable source for that matter. As I said with the chandelier thing, light-bulbs would be more efficient, but it just wouldn’t be right to use them if you’re trying to make a candle-style chandelier.</p>
<p>And I have no reason not to defend him. If he were an asshole towards <span class="bbcode-i">me</span>, then I would. But I’m an ass myself, and like his project. That gives me enough reason to defend him all I want.</p>
<p>Also, I’m proud of being a “prick”, ass, whatever you want to call it. Just how I am dewdddd.</p>

<p>There is a point in re-creating if the “real thing” is slapped on a pile of shit (Winterlove).

<p>You’ve got the wrong idea; I’m talking about efficiency, not output.</p>
<p>The reason I brought all this up was due to ranger squad, who was flaming Fridder because he suggested to use RuneSource. He could have handled it in a better manner such as “I’d rather stick with All-star, thanks.”, rather than telling him he’s retarded.
