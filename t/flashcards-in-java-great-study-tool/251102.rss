    <title>FlashCards in Java [Great Study Tool]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/flashcards-in-java-great-study-tool/251102</link>
    <description>I recently had the need to study some vocab for my french class and I wanted to use flashcards.  However, being notoriously lazy, I didn&#39;t actually want to make real flashcards.  So I hopped on good ol&#39; eclipse and worked up a crude simple program to write text files with the flashcard information and another program to quiz you.  Its simple, but at least personally it was quite effective.  So here they are :

[b]1st program[/b] : Flash Card Maker.

To Use : Run the program. 2 dialog boxes should pop up asking for file names.  Just invent whatever name you would like to call the 2 files, and put .txt after it so you can manually edit them int notepad at a later time if you want.  (If that doesn&#39;t make any sense, you&#39;ll understand after you run the program).  Then you will be repeatedly asked for questions and answers and they will be written into their respective files.  When you are done, type &quot;Exit Now&quot; (case is ignored) and the program will exit.

[code]import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Scanner;

import javax.swing.JOptionPane;

public class MakeFlashCards {

	@SuppressWarnings(&quot;static-access&quot;)
	public static void main(String [] args) throws IOException {	    
		String firstFile = new JOptionPane(&quot;What is your first file name?&quot;).showInputDialog(&quot;What is your first file Name?&quot;);
		String secondFile = new JOptionPane(&quot;What is your second file name?&quot;).showInputDialog(&quot;What is your second file Name?&quot;);
		FileWriter frstFile = new FileWriter(firstFile);
		FileWriter scndFile = new FileWriter(secondFile);
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		while(true) {
		System.out.print(&quot;\nEnter word :&quot;);
		String first = scan.nextLine();
		System.out.print(&quot;Enter answer :&quot;);
		String second = scan.nextLine();
		frstFile.write(first + &quot;\n&quot;);
		scndFile.write(second + &quot;\n&quot;);
		}
	}
}
[/code]

[b]2nd Program[/b] : FlashCard Quizzer

To Use : Run the program.  2 dialog boxes will pop up again prompting you for 2 file names.  Just type in the same names you used in the first program with the .txt&#39;s after them.  Then the program will give you the first side of a flash card.  Hit enter to see the answer.  This will repeat until you exit.  If you encounter any problems please put them here.

[code]import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Scanner;
import javax.swing.JOptionPane;

public class FlashCards {

	@SuppressWarnings(&quot;static-access&quot;)
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		boolean repeat = true;
		String firstFile = new JOptionPane(&quot;What is your first file name?&quot;).showInputDialog(&quot;What is your first file Name?&quot;);
		String secondFile = new JOptionPane(&quot;What is your second file name?&quot;).showInputDialog(&quot;What is your second file Name?&quot;);
		
		while (repeat == true) {

			FileReader questions = new FileReader(firstFile);
			Scanner questScan = new Scanner(questions);

			FileReader answers = new FileReader(secondFile);
			Scanner ansScan = new Scanner(answers);

			Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);

			while (questScan.hasNextLine()) {
				System.out.print(questScan.nextLine());
				scan.nextLine();
				System.out.println(ansScan.nextLine());
				scan.nextLine();
			}
			System.out.print(&quot;Type 1 to repeat : &quot;);
			int i = scan.nextInt();
			scan.nextLine();
			if(i != 1) {
				repeat = false;
			}
		}
	}

}
[/code]

Thanks and I hope this helps ;-)</description>

<p>Except my program is still shite. The GUI was fked and the program is almost zero Object Oriented.</p>
