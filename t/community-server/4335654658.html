<p>Only problem with that is you have to trust one person to host a loginserver, and multiple hosts of a world nodes (which cannot differ from other sources)</p>

What’s stopping people from creating an ‘unofficial’ server. I mean if you put enough effort into it, and then talk to MITB about getting it to be ‘official’ I don’t think it’d be a problem. It would have to be very high quality but still.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>If I understand correctly if you use Osirus as the base it can never be the “offical” moparscape server. but you can still use it for your own work and if the community wants to use it and build a community server with it, it can be the “unoffical, offical server” just create a dev team thread.[/quote]</p>
<p>I think a community driven thread of what they want and who they think should be the leaders of that would be a first step.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t the support be something that MITB has to endorse? I’d be very interesting in seeing this happen but I think before people even talk about the server, this should be handled.</p>

        <p>I think before any decisions need to happen, someone needs to answer why we need a community server? The only reason I’ve really ever seen is “it would be cool.” This is not a beneficial reason to the community, in my perspective. If people have good reasons, then we can directly address those reasons, rather than continue to bicker about the often repeated request of a community server, for the sake of having one.</p>

        <p>I’d see it as a good way to get some of the community exposed and also give way for documentation up the bum because most likely we will have to have people split into server/client development teams. It would promote a community sense of pride I guess and the like. Also I think it’d be fun. I’m interesting to see what the community, as a whole, could manage to create.</p>

<p>I think before any decisions need to happen, someone needs to answer why we need a community server? The only reason I’ve really ever seen is “it would be cool.” This is not a beneficial reason to the community, in my perspective. If people have good reasons, then we can directly address those reasons, rather than continue to bicker about the often repeated request of a community server, for the sake of having one.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If you are going to have a community server where others can just play yes its just “cool” as you put it, However if you have a community server that is developed by the community evening the small stuff such as mapping out the object Id’s with an action trigger is beneficial to the learning process.</p>

While sure, it’s an interesting engineering and design feat, when it comes to running a server, it’s not viable. The differences in the revisions are there for a reason. The new revisions have more content, and leaving the people that wish to play on lower revisions out of the higher revision content isn’t a good idea. And what you’re suggesting has actually already been done. Ry actually did it year(s?) ago. He admits to the flaw of content discrepancies, and the only way I see to combat it is to get some sort of standard between the revisions, which defeats the purpose.</p>
<p>However, your idea could be implemented and just used on two different servers designed to host one revision each, but it sounds like a lot of wasted development time.</p>

        <p>I’d love to do a modern server. I don’t necessarily not like developing on an older server but I like the modern feel of clients. But I think this is something that needs to be discussed. I’m totally for this as it would be beneficial to the community.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/emily-2.html">@Emily</a> I think the point of this is not to get a server out there as fast as we can using the same base but maybe coming up with a different solution for each revision. It’ll be a huge engineering task and I think it will be quite fun. There hasn’t been a widely used base release in a very long time and I think the outcome of this could definitely be a cool new base.</p>

        <p>Well my arse remark pretty much reveals the problems I’ve been seeing with these topics. I asked for a reason to do a community server, and I got several different replies. No offense intended to anyone, but most of the reasons provided were just variations of “it would be cool.” A valid reason is the difference between servers designed to earn revenue versus freely shared servers, but does that really make much difference in the end? In terms of organized content, perhaps. Really, the best reason supplied has to be the learning experience. Nevertheless, is an entire community server needed for such a feat? Could we just have a series of tutorials instead? What do we achieve by teaching the community in this way?</p>
<p>I’m mostly playing devil’s advocate here. I have, as far as I remember, always backed the idea of a community project, though at my most cynical times, basically dissuaded its possibility with many questions, sorta how I am now. I don’t want to discourage the project, but I do want to try and evoke some list of differences between this proposition and its <span class="bbcode-b">many</span> predecessors. Those ones, most obviously have yet to succeed. The only project that’s come close to succeeding was hybridscape. As we can see, it hasn’t.</p>
<p>I ultimately propose our most successful route would to simply be adapting osiris, rather than taking the near-impossible journey of trying to develop our own base server all over again. Many of the programmers in this topic, however experienced they may be, may not really understand the bureaucracy of designing a server framework (again, no insults intended, these are simply my observations). There are a lot of design factors to consider, actual implementations, more design factors in regards to content systems, more implementations, testing, and so on. The regular pattern, but for tens of thousands of lines of code that need to work perfectly before any actual content can be written. That’s exhausting.</p>
<p>The only way I can endorse the idea this time around is if there is some agreement to use osiris. I’m not sure if my opinion even matters, since I probably won’t have time to provide contribution other than to give feedback once in a while and maybe try and manage part of the team, but I do say osiris is the only way to go.</p>
<p>As far as legality is concerned, the license is pretty clear. Moparisthebest has exclusive rights to use it on his website at this point. Whatever problems exist between blake and boomer are independent of his decision. The only thing that is gray area is boomer advertising paragon as the official implementation of the framework, which is entirely independent of this proposition.</p>
<p>two cents…</p>

        <p>[quote=“Taharok, post:37, topic:433565”]Well my arse remark pretty much reveals the problems I’ve been seeing with these topics. I asked for a reason to do a community server, and I got several different replies. No offense intended to anyone, but most of the reasons provided were just variations of “it would be cool.” A valid reason is the difference between servers designed to earn revenue versus freely shared servers, but does that really make much difference in the end? In terms of organized content, perhaps. Really, the best reason supplied has to be the learning experience. Nevertheless, is an entire community server needed for such a feat? Could we just have a series of tutorials instead? What do we achieve by teaching the community in this way?</p>
<p>I’m mostly playing devil’s advocate here. I have, as far as I remember, always backed the idea of a community project, though at my most cynical times, basically dissuaded its possibility with many questions, sorta how I am now. I don’t want to discourage the project, but I do want to try and evoke some list of differences between this proposition and its <span class="bbcode-b">many</span> predecessors. Those ones, most obviously have yet to succeed. The only project that’s come close to succeeding was hybridscape. As we can see, it hasn’t.</p>
<p>I ultimately propose our most successful route would to simply be adapting osiris, rather than taking the near-impossible journey of trying to develop our own base server all over again. Many of the programmers in this topic, however experienced they may be, may not really understand the bureaucracy of designing a server framework (again, no insults intended, these are simply my observations). There are a lot of design factors to consider, actual implementations, more design factors in regards to content systems, more implementations, testing, and so on. The regular pattern, but for tens of thousands of lines of code that need to work perfectly before any actual content can be written. That’s exhausting.</p>
<p>The only way I can endorse the idea this time around is if there is some agreement to use osiris. I’m not sure if my opinion even matters, since I probably won’t have time to provide contribution other than to give feedback once in a while and maybe try and manage part of the team, but I do say osiris is the only way to go.</p>
<p>As far as legality is concerned, the license is pretty clear. Moparisthebest has exclusive rights to use it on his website at this point. Whatever problems exist between blake and boomer are independent of his decision. The only thing that is gray area is boomer advertising paragon as the official implementation of the framework, which is entirely independent of this proposition.</p>
<p>two cents…[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t like designing servers for this exact purpose. For my current base I have been spending so much time on making sure that my networking design will not be changed in the future I have not made any new progress in over two weeks. Given I’ve been busy but I do agree with the general points of how hard server design can be. The design of a server of this magnitude would need to be discussed and in the end executive choices would have to be made because of the amount of arguments between parties. Of course this would also in part involve telling people to bugger off when they shouldn’t have an opinion about a certain design pattern or adaption. But that boils down to politics and I don’t think anyone wants to take responsibility for a project like this. Most of my concerns for a project like this is the amount of politics involved. I’ll just wait around to see what MITB’s opinion is on this.</p>
