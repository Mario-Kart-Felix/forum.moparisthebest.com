    <description>[b]I Have Found this and I Take No Credit For It.[/b]

This is very simple and I will try my best to explain the code.

[b]~Client Side~[/b]

[b]Step 1[/b]

Go into Class20.java and add this code [code]if(j == 4230){ // Cbow attack
int file = 1088;
if(FrameStart[file] &lt; 1)
Class36.methodCustomAnimations(false, file);
int[] frames = {64,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,249,0};
int[] delays = {10,5,4,4,3,3,5,11,3,4,5,6,3,3,3,3,3,2,1,0};
aClass20Array351[j].anInt352 = frames.length-1;
aClass20Array351[j].anIntArray353 = new int[frames.length-1];
aClass20Array351[j].anIntArray354 = new int[frames.length-1];
aClass20Array351[j].anIntArray355 = new int[frames.length-1];
for(int i2 = 0; i2 &lt; frames.length-1; i2++){
aClass20Array351[j].anIntArray353[i2] = frames[i2]+FrameStart[file];
aClass20Array351[j].anIntArray354[i2] = -1;
aClass20Array351[j].anIntArray355[i2] = delays[i2];
}
}[/code]
This will play the Anim file When We Add The Anim File In The Next Step.

[b]Step 2[/b]

Download these files and Un-Zip them [URL=http://uppit.com/aip8rwpnxq4a/Crossbow_Anims.zip]Crossbow Anims.zip - 11 Kb[/URL]. Now open up your Anim Folder (Its Normally in Your Cache or Client Files) and add the 2 files into the Folder (If there is already a file with the same number change both of the files to a different number that isnt in use and then change [code]if(j == 4230){[/code] to the new number.) Now Save and Compile Your Client and You have the Working Attack Emote!

This Is The Main File That The Int In Class20 Reads.

[b]But Were Not Done Yet[/b]

[b]Step 3-Server Side[/b]

Note: This Is For Delta Since Most People Use It

Ok first get the item id for your cross bow. Mine is 837 so i will be using that. Search this is client.java [code]if(id == 837)[/code] Keep on searching until you see this at the top of the code [code]public int GetWepAnim(int id)[/code] Once you see that you know your at the right spot. Now under [code]if(id == 837)[/code] you will see something like this [code]{
return 1084;
}[/code] The 1084 is the emote being played when you attack with the crossbow. (It Could Be Different For You) So now replace 1084 or what ever the emote number that is there with your emote id for the new crossbow emote. Then Save and Compile And it Will work.

This Plays the New Emote When You Attack With The Cross Bow.

Well Wasn&#39;t That Easy Your All Done. Please Reply And Tell Me What You Thought Of This Guide.</description>

Stop trying to dictate on what is determined as ‘shit’. The only thing I have seen you release is a lunar package which would not even be your work; just things you have taken from clients.<br>

<p>Didn’t even work…? Its not copy and paste. Like I said in my post, I required every bit of it from dumps, spent hours finding models, and animations.</p>
<p>You have no room to talk, you don’t even know how to fix a else without if error lol. And your entire NBK release is interfaces taken from other clients.</p>

              <p><span class="bbcode-b">I Have Found this and I Take No Credit For It.</span></p>
<p>This is very simple and I will try my best to explain the code.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">~Client Side~</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 1</span></p>
<p>Go into Class20.java and add this code <code>if(j == 4230){ // Cbow attack
int file = 1088;
if(FrameStart[file] &lt; 1)
Class36.methodCustomAnimations(false, file);
int[] frames = {64,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,249,0};
int[] delays = {10,5,4,4,3,3,5,11,3,4,5,6,3,3,3,3,3,2,1,0};
aClass20Array351[j].anInt352 = frames.length-1;
aClass20Array351[j].anIntArray353 = new int[frames.length-1];
aClass20Array351[j].anIntArray354 = new int[frames.length-1];
aClass20Array351[j].anIntArray355 = new int[frames.length-1];
for(int i2 = 0; i2 &lt; frames.length-1; i2++){
aClass20Array351[j].anIntArray353[i2] = frames[i2]+FrameStart[file];
aClass20Array351[j].anIntArray354[i2] = -1;
aClass20Array351[j].anIntArray355[i2] = delays[i2];
}
}</code><br>
This will play the Anim file When We Add The Anim File In The Next Step.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 2</span></p>
<p>Download these files and Un-Zip them <a href="http://uppit.com/aip8rwpnxq4a/Crossbow_Anims.zip" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Crossbow Anims.zip - 11 Kb</a>. Now open up your Anim Folder (Its Normally in Your Cache or Client Files) and add the 2 files into the Folder (If there is already a file with the same number change both of the files to a different number that isnt in use and then change <code>if(j == 4230){</code> to the new number.) Now Save and Compile Your Client and You have the Working Attack Emote!</p>
<p>This Is The Main File That The Int In Class20 Reads.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">But Were Not Done Yet</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 3-Server Side</span></p>
<p>Note: This Is For Delta Since Most People Use It</p>
<p>Ok first get the item id for your cross bow. Mine is 837 so i will be using that. Search this is client.java <code>if(id == 837)</code> Keep on searching until you see this at the top of the code <code>public int GetWepAnim(int id)</code> Once you see that you know your at the right spot. Now under <code>if(id == 837)</code> you will see something like this <code>{
return 1084;
}</code> The 1084 is the emote being played when you attack with the crossbow. (It Could Be Different For You) So now replace 1084 or what ever the emote number that is there with your emote id for the new crossbow emote. Then Save and Compile And it Will work.</p>
<p>This Plays the New Emote When You Attack With The Cross Bow.</p>
<p>Well Wasn’t That Easy Your All Done. Please Reply And Tell Me What You Thought Of This Guide.</p>
