[SIZE=3][COLOR=&quot;#FF0000&quot;]Rune-Scene[/COLOR] is a 317 revision Runescape Private Server. It has been in development for quite a few months to ensure that the release can be as flawless as possible! We are brand new and thus are looking for an experienced staff team to help manage in-game and our website, please apply on our forums. 

We have:
Flawless PvP With 100% working EP system (Must be risking over 5m for EP to increase) for those daring PKers who like to risk a little to gain a little more. We have various PvP locations to ensure that they will not overcrowd when we have a larger player-base. There are NO rules to PKing which ensures, like RuneScape, there can be no &quot;scammers&quot; from the wilderness. 
Higher EP = Better PvP drops.
PkP are given for every kill and can be used to purchase items from our 3 PkPoint shops!

Over 30 Loyalty Titles

Flawless Skilling: All 25 skills are trainable with a maximum level of 99. You will be given &quot;Level Points&quot; for every time you level up and these can be saved up and spent in our &quot;Level Shop&quot; to purchase some very expensive and trendy items. Some of our skilling locations are entirely unique and never to be seen before Rune-Scene. Unlike many other RuneScape Private Servers, skilling at Rune-Scene is an excellent way to make cash both in the short and long run.

Flawless PvM: At Rune-Scene we have many bosses and many minigames. Many of our items cannot be bought from the shops which means that those PvMers can make a wad load of cash by selling their loots from bosses and monsters to those who just like to pk;) Our PvM system is entirely re-written and unique to ensure that player clipping is 100% perfect and combat is flawless from both players and NPC&#39;s.

Player: Once you reach 99 in all combat stats (Hitpoints, Attack, Strength, Defence, Mage, Range) You can type :: prestige. This will reset your combat stats but prestige you to level 1. You can prestige as many times as you wish. You must prestige atleast once before you can use the ::yell command. Prestige levels are a great way to &quot;show-off&quot; to other Rune-Scene members as to how prestige you are. More benefits for Prestiged users will be coming soon.

once prestiged: Show&#39;s your prestige level:

We have 100% working Warrior Guilds which means that items such as defenders can only be obtained through Warrior Guild or from other players who have legitimately obtained them.

More Coming soon :

We also have a 100% working &quot;[COLOR=&quot;#FF0000&quot;]Report Abuse Button[/COLOR] and system&quot; meaning that anyone disobeying the rules may be reported by any other player and reports get read by a member of staff at the end of the day and action may be taken. Please use the report abuse button fairly and wisely. 

There is so much content in Rune-Server, definately too much to list so here is some extra media and i&#39;ll see you in-game:) :
