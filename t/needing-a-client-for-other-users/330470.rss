    <title>Needing a client for other users</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/needing-a-client-for-other-users/330470</link>
    <description>I recently downloaded the Syscape Client with the server files, I have my own no-ip host, how can I get a 317 client which allows users to change the ip, and will allow them to log into my server. 

I have tried it on Moparscape v3.2 but that doesn&#39;t work, any other clients that are for 317, which allow other users to change the ip and to log into my server.</description>
