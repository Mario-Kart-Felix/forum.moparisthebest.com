    <description>Hello Moparians! 
Today I will be showing you my project that has been in development for several months now. 
Before I make a long speech 75% of you won&#39;t read, I&#39;m just going to give you some pictures, and information at the bottom! 
Note that a lot of things are subject to change, and that this server is not fully &quot;public&quot; yet. This will be the only place I post about my server, and I&#39;m looking for &quot;BETA&quot; testers. Bug catchers, I think you know what I&#39;m saying at this point. But enjoy these pictures of these 742 Graphics ;)

Hello! If those pictures didn&#39;t pull you in, then.. I might understand. XD To be honest I really suggest you come and just make a account and test out the server. 
I havent put on a VPS yet but I after about a month of this BETA phase I will be purchasing one if the servers running smooth. 
Here is the kicker.. I&#39;m using hamachi ATM, Verison says that they will be trying to fix the port forwarding, but until then its either Hamachi, Or wait til I buy a VPS. 

Colossus will be something different than an other server. I know everyone says that, but here is what I&#39;m telling you, Colossus will be ran by the players; In the sense that I code my own server, and I&#39;m IRL with all the admins. That leaves no room for error in the administration, I&#39;ll be taking polls and listening to every player that puts time into make this server one of the best in all Private Servers.. I hope you will be among those players. 

NOW HOW TO PLAY! 
Head to my website, and there are instructions there! http://colossus-server.yolasite.com/
Thanks for all your time! 
Sorry if this post rambled and ran on a bit but I had to type this and gather the pictures in a rush!
Leave a comment, Flame me or encourage it.. all chat is accepted. 
Anything to make my server in a better standing c:
