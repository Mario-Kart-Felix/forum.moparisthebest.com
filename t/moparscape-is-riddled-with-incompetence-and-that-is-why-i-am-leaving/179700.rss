    <description>But, before i go, im going to show you all what the community has become.

Major Reason i am leaving: 
People like the Following.
[quote=&quot;PEN()R, post:13, topic:164461&quot;]Leach my penis, froob. 

TX&#39;es

Its rune-loft client renamed. Punish that leaching piece of froobiness. Im frightened of these forums.[/quote]

[quote=&quot;t x, post:17, topic:164461&quot;]That is my client ROFL LEECHER PLEASE[/quote]

[quote=&quot;dantotman, post:23, topic:164461&quot;]woooooooooooow looks like my client how strange[/quote]

[quote=&quot;eczema3, post:415, topic:164461&quot;][quote author=t x link=topic=223305.msg1928347#msg1928347 date=1197565287]
That is my client ROFL LEECHER PLEASE 
[/quote]

WWWWRRRRROOOONNNNGGGGGG

&#39;tis CSK client, which YOU! leeched..[/quote]

[quote=&quot;medievil, post:414, topic:164461&quot;]looks nice btw leech[/quote]

And it just continues. People accusing of leeching, even though they have no proof what-so-ever.

Reason #2. Idiots.
How hard is it to follow rules? Honestly. Every Other hour there is a &quot;New Serious&quot; Devolpment team, wich happens to be based around a forum, wich is not allowed. Or then people post stuff in the most inapropriate section&#39;s. Look at some of these posts.

**Posted in Moparscape Questions**
[quote=&quot;sasuke8787, post:1, topic:179638&quot;]okj i downloaded and installed jdk but it says i dont have it whats the problem[/quote]

[quote=&quot;sixy16, post:1, topic:179678&quot;]addme at fofosho331@hotmail.com u do nothing i code and all just message me![/quote]

**end**

People just dont follow basic rules. Moparscape Questions is for MOPARSCAPE CLIENT QUESTIONS, not pl0x hst m l33ch3d srvr.

So basically, to sum it up, Moparscape.org is riddled with Incompetence.

And so, i will be departing this community, and i wont be going to Runelocus, it will end up like Moparscape one day, it is inivetible, and google is already screw&#39;d too much. 
But there are alot of Good user&#39;s out there, who followed the rules, and were helpfull.

Im not going to name them, but im sure they know who they are.</description>

<p>And it just continues. People accusing of leeching, even though they have no proof what-so-ever.</p>
<p>Reason <span class="hashtag">#2</span>. Idiots.<br>
How hard is it to follow rules? Honestly. Every Other hour there is a “New Serious” Devolpment team, wich happens to be based around a forum, wich is not allowed. Or then people post stuff in the most inapropriate section’s. Look at some of these posts.</p>

<p>People just dont follow basic rules. Moparscape Questions is for MOPARSCAPE CLIENT QUESTIONS, not pl0x hst m l33ch3d srvr.</p>
<p>So basically, to sum it up, <a href="http://Moparscape.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparscape.org</a> is riddled with Incompetence.</p>
<p>And so, i will be departing this community, and i wont be going to Runelocus, it will end up like Moparscape one day, it is inivetible, and google is already screw’d too much.<br>
But there are alot of Good user’s out there, who followed the rules, and were helpfull.</p>
<p>Im not going to name them, but im sure they know who they are.</p>
