    <title>RSCD - Few Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rscd-few-questions/294627</link>
    <description>For a few weeks now I have been editing around with the RSCD server I downloaded. I&#39;m not planning to make my own server to release or host yet as I&#39;m not very knowledgeable in Java to do so, I&#39;m only experimenting and using tutorials for now until I get better so I can solve these questions by myself. So far I am capable of changing minor things such as requirements, exp, size of client, sprites, names, locations, etc. all from tutorials and some I managed to do by myself. Anyway, I have a few questions that I couldn&#39;t solve on my own. I&#39;ve experimented with all of them (even though I probably shouldn&#39;t) so I was hoping someone could help me do them.

My first question is adding a requirement for a command. I&#39;m sure your all familiar with the &quot;::shout&quot; command, but basically I want to make it so that you need a required combat level (lets say 30) in order to use it. I tried searching for files with similar lines relating to see what would happen but failed to get it to work.

My second question (this is probably an easy one but I couldn&#39;t manage to get it ) is having a message come up you use an item on another item in your inventory. I was editing around in the InvUseOnItem.java file when I was trying to make it so when you use a tinderbox on logs in your inventory, a message would you that you need to drop your logs on the ground before lighting a fire (its a stupid thing to put in, but I wanted to do this).

My last question for now is would it be possible to make it so that when you type something in capitals in the chat bar, it would come out capitals instead of lowercase, for example: normally if you were to type in TEST, only the first letter would come out in capitals or the rest would come out lowercase. Basically what I want to do is make it so that if you typed in TeST or TEST, the letters you wrote in capitals would come out in capitals instead of being lowercase. 

If my questions aren&#39;t very clear, please tell me and I will try to make them as clear as i can. At first before I posted this, I wanted to PM somebody these questions because I don&#39;t think that they are necessary of asking and are easy to solve, but they were bugging me for a long time so I just wanted to get them solved. Thanks fin advance if you can help me!</description>

<p>Also, this isn’t really necessary but I noticed in the code you gave me for my second question, whenever you were to click any random item on the tinderbox (or logs, I forget), the message saying you would need to drop the logs first would appear, but I managed to fix it, so if anyone’s going to use that code, they’ll have to change it slightly… (1 second fix ;))<br>
Currently, I have a similar problem to this when the logs are on the ground and you try to use another item on it, the message I want would appear. I’ll continue trying to fix it though as I want to refrain from asking anymore questions for a while.</p>

Otherwise level 29s will be able to use it also.</p>
<p>As for the chat caps thing, RSC uses somekind of a filter that converts chat strings into byte arrays and then later back again. I guess they format them to lowercase characters somewhere along the line. I’ll reply with some code when I get home.</p>

<p>Thats why im taking my time to help him =P</p>
<p>Anyways, rocky form a quick look through the code you posted above, it looks like you have an extra “{” after the else statement. Try this:</p>
<p>[code]if (cmd.equals(“shout”)) {<br>
if (player.getCombatLevel() &lt; 29) {<br>
player.getActionSender().sendMessage(“Inorder to use this command, you need a combat level of 30”);<br>
}<br>
else {</p>
<pre><code>            ArrayList playersToSend = new ArrayList();
            Player p;
            for(Iterator i$ = world.getPlayers().iterator(); i$.hasNext(); playersToSend.add(p))
            p = (Player)i$.next();
            String newStr = "@gre@";
            for(int i = 0; i &lt; args.length; i++)
                newStr = (new StringBuilder()).append(newStr).append(args[i]).append(" ").toString();
            newStr = (new StringBuilder()).append("#adm#").append(player.getUsername()).append(": ").append(newStr).toString();
            Player pl;
            for(Iterator i$ = playersToSend.iterator(); i$.hasNext(); pl.getActionSender().sendMessage(newStr))
                pl = (Player)i$.next();
		}
		return;
	}[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>Sry for the fail indenting, its kinda hard todo it on here <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>For your last question, I bet your looking in the client; try looking in the server for the tolowerCase(). But again, im not 100% sure about that</p>

              <p>Ah, thanks for helping me out Adu, I truly appreciate it! I shall try these out now. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>EDIT: I still got an error with my first question, perhaps I placed the code wrong. (At one point it sent the message saying you need a combat lvl of 30, but the “Shout” message still got through)<br>
Here is what I have but I still continue to get errors:</p>
<p><code>if (cmd.equals("shout")) {
if (player.getCombatLevel() &lt; 29) {
player.getActionSender().sendMessage("Inorder to use this command, you need a combat level of 30");
}
else {
        {
            ArrayList playersToSend = new ArrayList();
                Player p;
                for(Iterator i$ = world.getPlayers().iterator(); i$.hasNext(); playersToSend.add(p))
                    p = (Player)i$.next();
            String newStr = "@gre@";
            for(int i = 0; i &lt; args.length; i++)
                newStr = (new StringBuilder()).append(newStr).append(args[i]).append(" ").toString();
            newStr = (new StringBuilder()).append("#adm#").append(player.getUsername()).append(": ").append(newStr).toString();
            Player pl;
            for(Iterator i$ = playersToSend.iterator(); i$.hasNext(); pl.getActionSender().sendMessage(newStr))
                pl = (Player)i$.next();
}
return;
</code></p>
<p>The second one worked perfectly, thanks :).</p>
<p>The last one either didn’t work either because I did it wrong or like you said, you weren’t sure if you were right, but I still thankyou for your answering my questions. I noticed that there were many files that contained toLowerCase(), but I think that these are the main files to be changed is something in the GameImage.Java and one DataConversions.java. In DataConversions.java when I removed the .toLowerCase() and typed capitals, the text became invisible in game.</p>
<p>Hope you can solve the problem i have in my first question. Thanks!</p>

              <ol>
<li>In player.java there is a method that get’s the combat level of the player. That method is “getCombatLevel()”, so for your shout command you would need todo something like this:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (cmd.equals("shout")) {
if (player.getCombatLevel() &lt; 29) {
player.getActionSender().sendMessage("Inorder to use this command, you need a combat level of 30");

else {</code></pre>
<p>After the “else {” You would need to add your shout method and end with a “}” and “return;” after.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Your in the right file but im going to show you the long way of doing that because doing it the short way would require some java knowledge . At the top of the file you should see a bunch of “else if” statements. The last one being</li>
</ol>
<p><code>else if(item2.getID() == 526 &amp;&amp; combineKeys(player, item2, item1)) {
			return;
		}</code><br>
Underneath that whole block of code add</p>
<p><code>
else if(item1.getID() == 166 || item1.getID() == 14 &amp;&amp; item2.getID() == 166 || item2.getID() == 14) {
			player.getActionSender().sendMessage("You need to drop the logs first");
			return;
		}</code><br>
Now that code will check if the first item you click on (item1) and compare it to the second item you click on (item2). So, to explain that code in words would be like so.</p>
<p>If the first clicked item id is equal too 166 (tinderbox) OR (||) 14 (regular logs) AND if the second clicked item is equal to 166 or 14, it will send a message to the player stating that they will need to drop the logs.</p>
<p>I said this was the long way because you would need to add more of these else if statements for different types of logs or add on to the code i gave you with other logs id. The short way would require you making your own method and using arrays for logs id and then sending the message.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Im not too sure about this one as iv never checked up on this. If im not mistaken, the server sends a packet to the client containing the message. If you find where the chatmessage packet is constructed, I think you will find a “toLowerCase()” add-on to the message. Removing that will get rid of your problem but I don’t dont know if im right.</li>
</ol>

              <p>For a few weeks now I have been editing around with the RSCD server I downloaded. I’m not planning to make my own server to release or host yet as I’m not very knowledgeable in Java to do so, I’m only experimenting and using tutorials for now until I get better so I can solve these questions by myself. So far I am capable of changing minor things such as requirements, exp, size of client, sprites, names, locations, etc. all from tutorials and some I managed to do by myself. Anyway, I have a few questions that I couldn’t solve on my own. I’ve experimented with all of them (even though I probably shouldn’t) so I was hoping someone could help me do them.</p>
<p>My first question is adding a requirement for a command. I’m sure your all familiar with the “::shout” command, but basically I want to make it so that you need a required combat level (lets say 30) in order to use it. I tried searching for files with similar lines relating to see what would happen but failed to get it to work.</p>
<p>My second question (this is probably an easy one but I couldn’t manage to get it ) is having a message come up you use an item on another item in your inventory. I was editing around in the InvUseOnItem.java file when I was trying to make it so when you use a tinderbox on logs in your inventory, a message would you that you need to drop your logs on the ground before lighting a fire (its a stupid thing to put in, but I wanted to do this).</p>
<p>My last question for now is would it be possible to make it so that when you type something in capitals in the chat bar, it would come out capitals instead of lowercase, for example: normally if you were to type in TEST, only the first letter would come out in capitals or the rest would come out lowercase. Basically what I want to do is make it so that if you typed in TeST or TEST, the letters you wrote in capitals would come out in capitals instead of being lowercase.</p>
<p>If my questions aren’t very clear, please tell me and I will try to make them as clear as i can. At first before I posted this, I wanted to PM somebody these questions because I don’t think that they are necessary of asking and are easy to solve, but they were bugging me for a long time so I just wanted to get them solved. Thanks fin advance if you can help me!</p>
