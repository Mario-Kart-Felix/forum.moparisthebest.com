    <title>Player won&#39;t Save</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-wont-save/357503</link>
    <description>Hi,



  I&#39;m having a problem with my cheezscape update 80 source.

Whenever I log off, my character won&#39;t save. I&#39;ve trired tons of different things, but none  seem to work. I gave full control to the folder, I switched player.java, playersave. java, and playerhandler.java with those of other servers.

No matter what I try it just won&#39;t save.

The server is able to autosave every 5 minutes though.

Can anyone please help me fix this? I&#39;ve made a bunch of different threads, but got no working response.</description>

              <p>I know where the save method is, that is not working. I don’t know anything about the autosave method as of yet., and can’t seem to find it.</p>
<p>This problem has happened once before, when I tried searching it up. There was no answer to the same problem I have now.</p>
<p>Cheezscape, is very buggy.</p>

              <p>So you know it saves every five minutes. So you know where and what the save method looks like. Just implement the method that is used every five minutes to your log-out method?</p>

<p>I’m having a problem saving when the person is logging off.</p>
<p>The same thing happens with project 16.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t happen with testscape source, so i tried taking the entire playerhandler.java, but it didn’t fix it.</p>
<p>I’m thinking if I could make a ::save command, that might help, or if I could make the server autosave, let’s say, every 3 seconds.</p>
<p>Or If someone can just help me fix it normally.</p>
