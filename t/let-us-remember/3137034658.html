People calling themselves Christian and hating Jews are not really a Christian. Me for one do not hate the Jews also I don’t say that what America did to the Japanese, same goes for what the Japanese did to the Americans was ok either. War is horrible and idiotic.

<p>I’m sorry if I got the image wrong, but it’s hard to not judge you loving Hitler when you post a picture of him and tells us to remember those who perished, as in Hitler killing himself. Of course it’s highly possible that you meant: remember those who died under his regime , but I was a bit to quick on the reply button.</p>

I know it’s cool and all to “leik naz1s!” but millions died for our freedoms today and I think we owe them some respect.<br>
[/quote]Define freedom. Most of us are white, if Hitler did take over the world we would live in a utopian society.[/quote]<br>
When I say our, I am not talking about the white race. More the human race ya?</p>
<p>Also, you compare the atomic bombing of Japan, a war crime (which I suppose it is) but is it comparable to the open witch-hunt of Jews, gays, blacks and other minorities and the eventual near-extermination of them? America dropped 2 bombs in order to end the war, the Nazis killed millions of innocents in order to please their leader and not end the war.</p>
<p>I do not think the Americans should have bombed the Japanese, as they are a proud nation who weren’t even considering surrendering after Hiroshima, unfortunately America had to go and bomb Nagasaki and the Japanese knew that more cities would be destroyed if they did not surrender. The Americans were brutal and spiteful, but after all Japan was the enemy and it was a war.</p>

        <p>I don’t understand all this talk about the atomic bomb being a ‘war crime’ or anything like that.  The nazis and japan bombed cities and towns full of civilians all the time, they were also working on an atomic bomb at the same time you know they would have used.  The allies had a choice, spend 5 to 10 more years at war with japan, losing thousands or perhaps millions of lives on both sides, or bomb 2 (remote, not very populous) towns and end it immediately.  They made the right choice.</p>

Atleast 220,000 civilians died instantaneously after the bombings and then talk about the after effects of the bombings…<br>
Atleast a mere 20% died after that and also, even now, plants and natural habitation isn’t experienced at it’s fullest in those 2 cities.</p>

I know it’s cool and all to “leik naz1s!” but millions died for our freedoms today and I think we owe them some respect.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I think the majority of the members here isn’t a Jew. Germany did invade the Netherlands, but the non-Jews that died during the occupation only died because of retaliation. And guess why innocent Palestines are killed by the Jews today? So yes, the Nazi’s were bad, but the Jews aren’t a bit better.[/quote]</p>
<p>Everyone sympathizes for today’s Jews because their ancestors were massacred. That is completely unnecessary because today’s Jews didn’t face anything, hardly any of them were alive at the time.</p>

<p>I don’t understand all this talk about the atomic bomb being a ‘war crime’ or anything like that.  The nazis and japan bombed cities and towns full of civilians all the time, they were also working on an atomic bomb at the same time you know they would have used.  The allies had a choice, spend 5 to 10 more years at war with japan, losing thousands or perhaps millions of lives on both sides, or bomb 2 (remote, not very populous) towns and end it immediately.  They made the right choice.</p>

</aside>
<p>Japan was weakened already, the only thing that stopped them from writing a peace agreement was their pride. And besides, just because they killed civilians doesn’t mean that you should do so too.</p>

<p>The Jewish people are pretty close knit. Therefore the most “pure” jews have VERY similar features, this will obviously produce stereotypes. And following these stereotypes is just a part of certain cultures, mainly the south park teen.</p>

<p>I don’t understand all this talk about the atomic bomb being a ‘war crime’ or anything like that.  The nazis and japan bombed cities and towns full of civilians all the time, they were also working on an atomic bomb at the same time you know they would have used.  The allies had a choice, spend 5 to 10 more years at war with japan, losing thousands or perhaps millions of lives on both sides, or bomb 2 (remote, not very populous) towns and end it immediately.  They made the right choice.</p>

<p>Also, the napalm attacks were far more damaging than the bombs.</p>

Atleast 220,000 civilians died instantaneously after the bombings and then talk about the after effects of the bombings…<br>
Atleast a mere 20% died after that and also, even now, plants and natural habitation isn’t experienced at it’s fullest in those 2 cities.[/quote]</p>
<p>It was the only choice.  Japan killed civilians as well, this isn’t some video game, war affects everyone.</p>
