Sorry if defending myself from looking like a Jew hater is wrong in your eyes. I was simply saying that according to the Bible, the Jews are the chosen people, and after some Jews rejected Jesus Christ as the Messiah, everyone got a chance to become God’s Children, the Jews are still remembered as the chosen people by Christians, so persecuting them would simply be wrong for a Christian.</p>
<p>Also, humans are faulty and not performing a sin every now and then is impossible, that’s why Jesus Christ died for all your sins.</p>

The allies had a choice, spend 5 to 10 more years at war with japan, losing thousands or perhaps millions of lives on both sides, or bomb 2 (remote, not very populous) towns and end it immediately.  They made the right choice.<br>

Also killing civilians.<br>
Atleast 220,000 civilians died instantaneously after the bombings and then talk about the after effects of the bombings…<br>
Atleast a mere 20% died after that and also, even now, plants and natural habitation isn’t experienced at it’s fullest in those 2 cities.[/quote]</p>
<p>It was the only choice.  Japan killed civilians as well, this isn’t some video game, war affects everyone.</p>

<p>The Jewish people are pretty close knit. Therefore the most “pure” jews have VERY similar features, this will obviously produce stereotypes. And following these stereotypes is just a part of certain cultures, mainly the south park teen.</p>

<p>I think the majority of the members here isn’t a Jew. Germany did invade the Netherlands, but the non-Jews that died during the occupation only died because of retaliation. And guess why innocent Palestines are killed by the Jews today? So yes, the Nazi’s were bad, but the Jews aren’t a bit better.[/quote]</p>
<p>Everyone sympathizes for today’s Jews because their ancestors were massacred. That is completely unnecessary because today’s Jews didn’t face anything, hardly any of them were alive at the time.</p>

              <p>I don’t understand all this talk about the atomic bomb being a ‘war crime’ or anything like that.  The nazis and japan bombed cities and towns full of civilians all the time, they were also working on an atomic bomb at the same time you know they would have used.  The allies had a choice, spend 5 to 10 more years at war with japan, losing thousands or perhaps millions of lives on both sides, or bomb 2 (remote, not very populous) towns and end it immediately.  They made the right choice.</p>
