    <title>Cannot play on my server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cannot-play-on-my-server/225770</link>
    <description>Hi, i have read the post in tutorial section about making a server and i did all of it even port forwarding...I think i did the portforwarding right anyway. Well i downloaded the source and all and started it up and it starts up fine (its manatee scape btw) and it says ManateeScape...Running. But i go into silabsoft client and login and it keeps saying error connecting to server. also when i was doing port forwarding i put my default gateway but it said i cannot have the same IP as router or something like that... I dont know if that has anything to do with it. Please help me because i have always wanted a server. Admin will be granted if it works  :)
