    <title>Bodybuilding - drugz</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bodybuilding-drugz/279611</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Belgium&#39;s bodybuilding championship contest was cancelled after all the contestants fled from the doping testers. 20 bodybuilders had attended to the contest.

-I have never seen anything like this and hope that I never have to see anything like it ever again, said Hans Cooman, one of the judges.

According to Cooman the bodybuilders grabbed their stuff and ran out when he arrived at the contest place.

Belgium&#39;s bodybuilding organization didn&#39;t deny the information, but announced that it doesn&#39;t have an explanation for the sudden dissapearance of the contestants. Last year in Belgium, Flander, three out of four contestants were caught from doping.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
