    <title>Do you guys feel any servers are unique?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/do-you-guys-feel-any-servers-are-unique/550473</link>
    <description>Hello guys, I am new to this forum and I hope I can be of any help to people :)

But back to my sort-of question, I was just looking at some of the servers on the advertisement section before I made my account and I (personally) have to say that they all seem the same. What I mean by this is that most people just try and replicate what Runescape have achieved,or are remakes &amp; pk servers which all have the same content and way of playing. I would like to see something different, by different I mean something that moves away from a server being associated with Runescape&#39;s philosophy and attempts to achieve a player-base not the cheap way. 

I think some server-owners are scared to try anything new, because they feel that anything new may look unusual and frowned upon by the public, which I totally can understand. I&#39;ve seen some servers that are clearly different and great fun to play, Project Rainbow is a cool, unique server, that hunger games server too ( if it&#39;s still up idk) and I remember seeing a server that was almost nothing like RS and was based on GTA with customs maps, items, npcs etc (also don&#39;t know if it&#39;s still up but it sure looked cool and unique). That&#39;s the sort of things i&#39;m talking about.

Sorry if I haven&#39;t explained myself properly, lol, I am currently making a server and I think it&#39;s good to hear other people&#39;s views on uniqueness on servers. It may also benifit other server owners too, to show them what the RSPS community want in a server now-a-days.</description>

As far as I know, there was a server by the name of ‘Guilds of Veldahar’ which seemed to have a cool concept, there was also my server which was PVM only and using known runescape skills but with a large twist to them… and I think there was another, hunger games or something like that.[/quote]</p>
<p>I agree with all the servers nowadays being absolutely the same. All are just some “317” PI when it is really a PI loading pre-eoc graphics. People shouldn’t be allowed to call those types of servers 317. Also, I like customs, if they’re implemented into the game well then they can be really good in my opinion. Also that hunger games server was decent, don’t really know if it is still up or not.</p>

I’d actually go as far as to say most servers are a joke anymore.</p>

<p>Another thing, people usually introduce customs they are extreme items. Usually new rares or new overpowered weapons or something of that nature, rather than items you would use in general gameplay. Like introducing a new set of herbs/potions.</p>

              <p>It’s possible to make a server unique, but it also takes time. And that was mentioned above. However, I believe you can still use the same general mechanics of Runescape such as the same combat formula and the same maps, but still make it unique. I think ideas such as everything is wild except certain spots would be cool (just my opinion) and maybe add some twisted ideas that make the server appeal to peoples darker side. Such as slavery, buying and selling slaves in a marketplace. Slaves male or female can be used as shields in combat to take damage, extra storage space when you’re on the move and can be given commands such as wait here, follow me, hold this. I’ve been working on something like this in my server and it’s been quite enjoyable.</p>
<p>Also I think if everything is wild, bounty hunting will come into play. Players can set bounties on other players heads for a cash reward. So if someone dislikes a player they can put 1m on the players head, I realize all these ideas have their issues morally and non morally lol but I like to implement different ideas mostly for fun, and may one day release the server I’m working on to share with the community.</p>
<p>Some more ideas I have are, no shops but trade caravans that are located at different points of the map. Each trader sells different items, and has different prices. Also creating a quest that allows players to gain access to a perk called Barter me. this perk allows all items to be cheaper, and when the player sells an item they get more for it. Also there is no quick teles, players much either gather the runes to teleport or must use canoes, boats, ect to get around. Also players must choose good or bad karma and whatever side they pick has certain perks. When you kill those of opposite karma then you get points which can be used to upgrade skills or get certain items.</p>
<p>Just my thoughts</p>

<p>But back to my sort-of question, I was just looking at some of the servers on the advertisement section before I made my account and I (personally) have to say that they all seem the same. What I mean by this is that most people just try and replicate what Runescape have achieved,or are remakes &amp; pk servers which all have the same content and way of playing. I would like to see something different, by different I mean something that moves away from a server being associated with Runescape’s philosophy and attempts to achieve a player-base not the cheap way.</p>
<p>I think some server-owners are scared to try anything new, because they feel that anything new may look unusual and frowned upon by the public, which I totally can understand. I’ve seen some servers that are clearly different and great fun to play, Project Rainbow is a cool, unique server, that hunger games server too ( if it’s still up idk) and I remember seeing a server that was almost nothing like RS and was based on GTA with customs maps, items, npcs etc (also don’t know if it’s still up but it sure looked cool and unique). That’s the sort of things i’m talking about.</p>
<p>Sorry if I haven’t explained myself properly, lol, I am currently making a server and I think it’s good to hear other people’s views on uniqueness on servers. It may also benifit other server owners too, to show them what the RSPS community want in a server now-a-days.</p>

What I mean by this is that most people just try and replicate what Runescape have achieved,or are remakes &amp; pk servers which all have the same content and way of playing. I would like to see something different, by different I mean something that moves away from a server being associated with Runescape’s philosophy and attempts to achieve a player-base not the cheap way.</p>
<p>I think some server-owners are scared to try anything new, because they feel that anything new may look unusual and frowned upon by the public, which I totally can understand. I’ve seen some servers that are clearly different and great fun to play, Project Rainbow is a cool, unique server, that hunger games server too ( if it’s still up idk) and I remember seeing a server that was almost nothing like RS and was based on GTA with customs maps, items, npcs etc (also don’t know if it’s still up but it sure looked cool and unique). That’s the sort of things i’m talking about.</p>
<p>Sorry if I haven’t explained myself properly, lol, I am currently making a server and I think it’s good to hear other people’s views on uniqueness on servers. It may also benifit other server owners too, to show them what the RSPS community want in a server now-a-days.</p>
