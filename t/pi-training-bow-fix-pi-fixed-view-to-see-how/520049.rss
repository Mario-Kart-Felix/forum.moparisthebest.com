    <description>So, the item id = 9705, [b]Training Bow[/b], i added in combat assistant only it can use the Training Bow, but the problem is that, it gives me attack, str, def exp, instead of the Range exp or Range-Defence Exp. So what file do i go so it can be exactly like the others bows, giving range exp?

Media:
The interface for the Training Bow

*[FIXED]
Just add it on [b]itemassistant.java[/b] and add it on [b]public final int[] BOWS[/b] in the [b]player.java[/b] file, make sure to add the arrows.

Training Bow: id= 9705
Training Arrows: id= 9706</description>

              <p>Yeah i am doing that now, i am currently putting all the <span class="bbcode-b">Training Arrow</span> wherever i see <span class="bbcode-b">882</span>: Bronze Arrow.<br>
But i just made it to a 2h weapon, since you could wield a shield.</p>
<p>But i still need help with making it give range exp, instead of combat, i looked all over and i put it on where <span class="bbcode-b">item: 841; shortbow </span> is,â€¦</p>

              <p>If I were you, I would search for ids of other bows and add it into those places, bows without special attack. It probably just has to be defined as a bow.</p>
