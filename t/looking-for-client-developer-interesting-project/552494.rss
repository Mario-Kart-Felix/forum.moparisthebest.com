    <title>Looking for client developer [Interesting Project]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-client-developer-interesting-project/552494</link>
    <description>[center][b][size=12pt]I am working on a project that will rise and show the RSPS community what is what again.
I already have a server developer who is doing a good job. So I am looking to find a client developer who knows what he is doing.
We can discuss all the information over skype. The project is very unique and will be fully financed by me.
My team has a server developer and a very talented website developer so far.
My friend who I know for 5 years now owns Recklesspk aka instantpk.com
which is also a great server. And he is down with helping me make this project big.[/size]

What I will provide for this project:

- To do list
- Test VPS for pre-beta
- Dedi for beta
- Dedi for Website
- DDOSE Protected dedi for server release
- Server developer, website developer and you: (client developer) )

Please reply if you are interested or leave your skype, my skype is: Rafr200

Thank you,
