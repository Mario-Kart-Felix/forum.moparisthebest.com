    <title>Problem with my scrolling</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-my-scrolling/429138</link>
    <description>Well, i&#39;m no tech-wiz so I have no idea what&#39;s wrong. I recently came on to my computer to discover the icons were all enlarged, so after restoring them to their previous size I then noticed while scrolling on websites, the scrolling animation is quite choppy, as in you can see the previous frame fly up the page and the new one replace it. It is happening on both Google Chrome and Internet explorer, so I doubt it has anything to do with my browser..

Does anybody have an idea of how to fix this?</description>

<p>I found out my video driver was severely outdated there and had to update it. Seems to be working fine now, cheers for the help!</p>
