    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-port-forwarding/324188</link>
    <description>Ok so I made a 317 server and now ive tried to port forward 3 times but I have no clue how to because all of the tuts show a different router than the one I have. I have a D-Link model 524. When i get into the router i dont know what to do? Can anyone help me with this on teamviewer or over msn?? I cant log into my server because it keeps saying error connecting..-.-</description>
