    <title>[PI] Changing the logout interface</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-changing-the-logout-interface/419364</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;ve made a custom interface for logging out, but I&#39;ve ran into a problem of getting it to actually work

Basically what i need it to do is when you click the &quot;X&quot; In the top right hand corner, I need it to open up that interface, I change the client side, sidebutton but that just made it load into the side gameframe thing, when i need it to load in the gameplay screen, If anyone knows how to do this, please let me know, thanks :)</description>
