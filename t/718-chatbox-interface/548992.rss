    <title>718 Chatbox Interface</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-chatbox-interface/548992</link>
    <description>Hey, I know this is possible but it doesn&#39;t seem to work for me. On just about every 718+ server, when a chatbox interface is displayed, a player can be in the very middle of an extensively long dialogue and he or she can accidently click somewhere on the interface (other than the &quot;click here to continue&quot; button) and that player will walk to wherever he or she clicked as if an interface wasn&#39;t even displayed thus closing the interface. I was wondering if somebody can help me resolve this? 

I want it so that if a chatbox interface is displayed, a player can&#39;t just click through it and accidently walk every which way, he or she will have to click the MINIMAP in order to walk, like RuneScape. I understand how to do this, but for some reason it&#39;s not working. I have a boolean, in my InterfaceManager class, called &quot;chatboxInterDisplayed()&quot; and I took that in the WorldPacketsDecoder class and put the following:

[code]if (player.getInterfaceManager().chatboxInterDisplayed() &amp;&amp; packetId != MINI_WALKING_PACKET) {
return;
}[/code]

And I put it at the top of the correct method, decodeLogicPackets, before all other packets are decoded. But it still doesn&#39;t work. Any help? Thanks</description>
