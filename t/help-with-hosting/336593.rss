    <description>Yes, i am clear on the rules, therefore in this topic nowhere will i be asking for a host.

I currently have a modem combo (modem and router all-in-one) that does not allow for portforwarding, so i need help with trying to host a server, not using hamachi. I am VERY new to this sort of thing, as i usually do small snippits of coding, but mainly graphics and modeling work for servers, but as my partners internet is choppy and unfit for hosting, the server needs a host. Therefore i must try to figure it out myself, which is seemingly becomin a larger problem  than i anticipated. All in all, i need a way to host a server without portforwarding. ANY HELP WILL BE APPRECIATED.</description>

<p>That’s not true being on a 64bit OS has nothing to do with portforwarding :s.</p>

              <p>Guys, don’t diss him. My router was also impossible to portforward it was a special type of linksys which only had 10 portforwarding slots. And correct me if I’m wrong you need 11 which I clearly read in SEVERAL tuts. Even in the pic on the tut of google they had 11 slots, yet i had 10:( I made 1 through a static ip at my fathers house. Sent the files over here, used the Duc20/no-ip account and hosted it. Now standing today, is my static ip server which runs on my computer with the fk3d up router but not portforwarded through my router. So thats a way you could do it. Go to a friends house with a static ip. (basically intenret through a cable box) also the ip will most likely start with 64.—.---.-- (meaning the 64 will be first 2 numbers depending on cable box. U download a source, run the source and check through a status checker the ip through ur no-ip account that u setup using the static ip. (it will work if done correctly, Then go to YOUR house where u have the router, download no-ip (using the account same as friends house or whereever. Check the box of the no-ip that u made with the static ip. Call ur friend, tell him to close the source. U run a source, and BOOM you’re hosting. (if this is to confusing, contact me.) go to runelocus and type in yoshi on search and go to the chatbox and i will help u there, (&lt;---- that was technically not adverting, but a way to contact me. So you can’t report.:))</p>

<p>I might be wrong but i think you need TCP to forward a rsps not sure. + Is it so that your router is password protected and you don’t know the password?</p>

              <p>Yes, i am clear on the rules, therefore in this topic nowhere will i be asking for a host.</p>
<p>I currently have a modem combo (modem and router all-in-one) that does not allow for portforwarding, so i need help with trying to host a server, not using hamachi. I am VERY new to this sort of thing, as i usually do small snippits of coding, but mainly graphics and modeling work for servers, but as my partners internet is choppy and unfit for hosting, the server needs a host. Therefore i must try to figure it out myself, which is seemingly becomin a larger problem  than i anticipated. All in all, i need a way to host a server without portforwarding. ANY HELP WILL BE APPRECIATED.</p>
