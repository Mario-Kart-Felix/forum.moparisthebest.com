[CENTER]The Original Zombie Adventure is Back![/CENTER]

[CENTER]Based open the popular First Person Shooter DayZ, RuneZ, the original zombie survival server, takes RuneScape Private Servers to a whole new level of creativity. The world has been engulfed by a zombie apocalypse, however, you, a &#39;survivor&#39;, wash upon the shore of this God forsaken world. Zombies roam through towns &amp; cities, getting in your way of the precious items that you need to survive. Items can be found in houses, shops, banks, barracks, fortresses, or anywhere with a door to get into, or a ladder to climb up to. You need essentials to survive. You need food, and you need water. As time passes, you start to get hungry, and thirsty. You have to pillage villages to find food, weapons, and armor to protect yourself from the vicious zombies...

...but...

Zombies are not your only problem.

There are other survivors, trying to live through this Hell. And they may be friendly, and they may not be. At any given moment, another survivor can jump out of the shadows, and kill you for ALL of your items. If you do die... if you fail to survive... you will be given the chance to start again, at the cost of combat levels being reset.

[Spoiler=Read me!]
[FONT=Century Gothic]Hello everyone and welcome back to RuneZ. After a very long hiatus I&#39;ve returned to the RSPS scene to try and perfect my original idea, RuneZ. Through college I&#39;ve learned a lot more about programming and will still be learning a lot more in the days to come. Through my new knowledge I&#39;ll have the tools to create a significantly better server than before. If you ever looked at the leaked source code of RuneZ 1, you&#39;ll see that I took a lot of &#39;shortcuts&#39; in the code and didn&#39;t think things through, sort of &quot;glued&quot; it all together. That&#39;s not happening this time. I&#39;m planning things out, and doing it right.

The content in RuneZ 2 will also look and feel a lot different than the first. I&#39;m going to be taking some different approaches to things that didn&#39;t work the first time. For example, I&#39;m going to be dialing back the DayZ emulation a little bit. Before, my goal was to create DayZ, but inside of RuneScape. This sounded great at first but it&#39;s really hard to run a RSPS that way and made things quite difficult for myself, and players. In RuneZ 2, I&#39;ll still be going for about an 80-90% DayZ emulation, but with 10-20% RS themed ideas and content. You&#39;ll learn more about some of these ideas in the days to come, as for now I&#39;d like to thank everyone for their support on this thread, but also in the past when RuneZ 1 was still alive.

I&#39;m starting on a fresh source, and not using any of the past RuneZ code except some of the work with treasure chests (tents in DayZ).[/FONT]

[LIST]



[*]6/22 - Completed the Introduction Scene
[*]6/23 - Created the Dwarf Faction Camp
[*]6/24 - Created the Burthorpe/Taverley Survivor Camp
[*]6/24 - Rewrote the NPC combat script, NPC&#39;s hits now take into affect the player&#39;s armor, and defence level
[*]6/26 - Finished the Varrock Camp
[*]6/26 - We redid most of the Item spawn tables. They are more balanced now and have more utility
[*]6/26 - Finished all the faction camps (barbarian and desert was today)
[*]6/30 - Created the backpack system! There will be 4 types of backpacks. I have yet to name them, but their sizes will be 6, 10, 18, and 24. 
[*]7/1 - Finished up everything related to backpacks. That includes item options, handling death, picking them up, etc. All contents of the backpack will be dropped on the ground upon death.
[*]7/5 - Finished the Hunger and Thirst systems. They both start at 100, and deplete by 3 every 3 minutes (subject to change). Added waterskin support for thirst. If you have a waterskin in your inventory when it comes time to deplete your thirst, you will drink one dose of the waterskin and your thirst will not deplete. There will be water sources available (bottled water, bowls of water, etc) that will replenish your thirst by 20. Food will replenish your hunger by the amount at which they heal your HP. 
[*]7/6 - Bought webhosting, a domain, and a genuine IPB forums license! Also, I purchased the VPS today to get ready for final development and the private beta.
I&#39;ve still been busy with classes but one of them is ending tomorrow so I should have more time on my hands. As far as content goes, I&#39;ve added animals around the map (bears, wolves, rabbits, and chickens) along with their corresponding drops of meats, bones, etc.
[*]7/7 - We have launched the forums! Go to [url]http://www.runez.org[/url] to discuss the server and chat with other players!

[CENTER][CENTER][B][SIZE=5]What can I do to help?[/SIZE][/B][/CENTER][/CENTER]
[Spoiler=Read me! Please read me! Read it! Do it! Now!]

[FONT=Century Gothic]There&#39;s a number of things you can do to help out! First of all, please stay updated on this thread! The more involvement we get from you, the more motivated we are to work harder and get done faster! If we get a lot of involvement perhaps we will move to a social media platform to keep you updated. 

On a different note, where our support banner in your signatures! It really helps spread the word that we a re back and make the return even more grand!

[CENTER][IMG]https://stevenrajanabraham.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/support1a.gif[/img]
[/CENTER]

Lastly, PLEASE play the server on it&#39;s release. Even if you don&#39;t play RSPS any more, just give it a try and leave us some feedback. This server is unlike any others (literally), so I really want you to give it a try. On a related note invite your friends who used to play RS or RSPS to come play with you! Playing RuneZ with a friend is insanely fun! All that should come sooner to release.  [/FONT]

              <p>Pretty interesting but one server that i know of did come before this Zombie Scape but it included custom interfaces as well as ak-47s and pistols. If i remember right but it’s still different ideas in a way because this is focused very much on survivial more than just teleporting to varrock to kill lots of zombies. The night and day cycle is really cool.</p>
<p>I wish you the best. If you keep up the good work it may become a popular server</p>

<pre><code class="lang-auto">[LIST]



[*]6/22 - Completed the Introduction Scene
[*]6/23 - Created the Dwarf Faction Camp
[*]6/24 - Created the Burthorpe/Taverley Survivor Camp
[*]6/24 - Rewrote the NPC combat script, NPC's hits now take into affect the player's armor, and defence level
[*]6/26 - Finished the Varrock Camp
[*]6/26 - We redid most of the Item spawn tables. They are more balanced now and have more utility
[*]6/26 - Finished all the faction camps (barbarian and desert was today)
[*]6/30 - Created the backpack system! There will be 4 types of backpacks. I have yet to name them, but their sizes will be 6, 10, 18, and 24. 
[*]7/1 - Finished up everything related to backpacks. That includes item options, handling death, picking them up, etc. All contents of the backpack will be dropped on the ground upon death.
[*]7/5 - Finished the Hunger and Thirst systems. They both start at 100, and deplete by 3 every 3 minutes (subject to change). Added waterskin support for thirst. If you have a waterskin in your inventory when it comes time to deplete your thirst, you will drink one dose of the waterskin and your thirst will not deplete. There will be water sources available (bottled water, bowls of water, etc) that will replenish your thirst by 20. Food will replenish your hunger by the amount at which they heal your HP. 
[*]7/6 - Bought webhosting, a domain, and a genuine IPB forums license! Also, I purchased the VPS today to get ready for final development and the private beta.
I've still been busy with classes but one of them is ending tomorrow so I should have more time on my hands. As far as content goes, I've added animals around the map (bears, wolves, rabbits, and chickens) along with their corresponding drops of meats, bones, etc.
[*]7/7 - We have launched the forums! Go to [url]http://www.runez.org[/url] to discuss the server and chat with other players!

[Spoiler=Read me! Please read me! Read it! Do it! Now!]</p>
<p>[FONT=Century Gothic]There’s a number of things you can do to help out! First of all, please stay updated on this thread! The more involvement we get from you, the more motivated we are to work harder and get done faster! If we get a lot of involvement perhaps we will move to a social media platform to keep you updated.</p>
<p>On a different note, where our support banner in your signatures! It really helps spread the word that we a re back and make the return even more grand!</p>

<p>Lastly, PLEASE play the server on it’s release. Even if you don’t play RSPS any more, just give it a try and leave us some feedback. This server is unlike any others (literally), so I really want you to give it a try. On a related note invite your friends who used to play RS or RSPS to come play with you! Playing RuneZ with a friend is insanely fun! All that should come sooner to release.  [/FONT]<br>
