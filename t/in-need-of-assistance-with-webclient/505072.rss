    <title>In need of assistance with webclient</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/in-need-of-assistance-with-webclient/505072</link>
    <description>I need help with my webclient, because when I try to upload it; it comes up saying &quot;Error! Click for details.&quot; and when I click that it says &quot;client.class&quot;. 
I also had a problem finding some things when doing CTRL + F and couldn&#39;t actually find the coding when I was looking for it? That was needed to make the webclient work.

If you have any help or reasons why it doesn&#39;t work, message me or reply below please!!

James
