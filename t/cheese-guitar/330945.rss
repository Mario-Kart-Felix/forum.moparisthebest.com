<p>Well, it appears no matter how you format your posts, people are always getting pissed off, how about you just stop posting all together? Haha, just kidding.<br>
I’m so with you on Rap sucking, but System of a Down, Billy Talent, and “New Age Rock” are my favorite. I do like Iron Maiden and Metallica though.<br>
And just a question, are you foreign? Cause your English is horrible, no offense.</p>
<p>Honestly though, I think the thing that pisses people off the most in your writing, is the fact that you make run on sentences,while you also lack the use of commas, and if you do use commas, you use them as a comma-splice. It seems that half the people on the internet  do the exact same thing. Especially in tutorials, which really pisses me off. I need to download MS Word, just so that I can use spell check, grammar check, and formatting check, just to read tutorials nowadays.</p>

              <p>[quote=“WhiteWolves, post:15, topic:330945”]first of all<br>
you didn’t even quote me…<br>
lol, u quoted badger,</p>
<p>second of all,<br>
you proved yourself to be an idiot,<br>
saying that rap and “pop” are the most popular types of music,<br>
<em>news flash</em> pop stands for popular dumb ass<br>
and rap=retards attampting poetry</p>
<p>and sure,<br>
i’m really a humorous kinda person,<br>
except when i comes to music ESPECIALLY THE GUITAR,<br>
and i’m not like those other gay ass bitch’s who think that the guitar is “cool”<br>
i’ve got my first guitar when i was 8,<br>
i never listened to any crappy bands that were made beyond the 90s… cause it’s crap.</p>
<pre><code>          i listen to anything from the 60s to the 90s,  (69 &lt;3 lol,  inside joke O_o)
        bands like iron maiden,quiet riot, ramones, sex pistols, guns n roses, slash's snake pit, motorhead, areosmith, pearl jam, nirvana, metallica, johnny cash, led zepellin,scorpions, the police,jimi hendrix,black sabbath,chuck berry,bob marley, van halen,        zz top,  etc.etc.etc.etc.etc.

   sure there are some good bands nowadays like the queens of stoneage, seether,rammstein, dash board confesional,  etc. etc. 
</code></pre>
<p>but bands like system of a down and all that other crap uses too much computer tech.  anything beyond the whammy bar is a piece of shit to me :P[/quote]</p>
<p>I forgot how to respond in quote…</p>
<p>This is the last response your going to get from me. I’m not going to argue anymore other than this:</p>
<p>We all have our own opinions. I like Rap &amp; Pop. Thats not what they stand for.<br>
I like 80’s music. It’s pretty good. (I like Nirvana &amp; The Beetles.)</p>
<p>Now if you get really insulted by me posting an unfinished guitar model. I really wonder how you would feel about something else like as if somebody actually made it.</p>
<p>You think your cool for saying this about my model? Sorry, but I don’t think it’s working. If you want some real friends, try going offline and into the real world… and maybe a better attitude would help.</p>
<p>I don’t know how your Mom and Dad taugh you to grow up. Obviously they are “Still in the process of…” but seriously man, you just look stupid.</p>

Unless its something like some of us more advanced modelers on the forum who take on scenery and such with the model (for example SilentCJ and his ‘room’) Those can be a progressive topic, because its interesting to see the details change as it goes along.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/whitewolves">@WhiteWolves</a> - Just stfu dude, its not worth argueing over past 2 posts, sure, it may be an insult to you, but who gives a shit, honestly. Its a model, everybody starts somewhere, and just because you dont like it, doesn’t mean someone else wont. Rap for instance, i think is the worst music ever, then comes Blue’s and ‘Pop’. Its all based in opinion and we all have one, so stfu as if yours is the only one that matters, because in reality, nobodies does.</p>

you didn’t even quote me…<br>
lol, u quoted badger,</p>
<p>second of all,<br>
you proved yourself to be an idiot,<br>
saying that rap and “pop” are the most popular types of music,<br>
<em>news flash</em> pop stands for popular dumb ass<br>
and rap=retards attampting poetry</p>
<p>and sure,<br>
i’m really a humorous kinda person,<br>
except when i comes to music ESPECIALLY THE GUITAR,<br>
and i’m not like those other gay ass bitch’s who think that the guitar is “cool”<br>
i’ve got my first guitar when i was 8,<br>
i never listened to any crappy bands that were made beyond the 90s… cause it’s crap.</p>
<pre><code>          i listen to anything from the 60s to the 90s,  (69 &lt;3 lol,  inside joke O_o)
        bands like iron maiden,quiet riot, ramones, sex pistols, guns n roses, slash's snake pit, motorhead, areosmith, pearl jam, nirvana, metallica, johnny cash, led zepellin,scorpions, the police,jimi hendrix,black sabbath,chuck berry,bob marley, van halen,        zz top,  etc.etc.etc.etc.etc.

   sure there are some good bands nowadays like the queens of stoneage, seether,rammstein, dash board confesional,  etc. etc. 
</code></pre>
<p>but bands like system of a down and all that other crap uses too much computer tech.  anything beyond the whammy bar is a piece of shit to me <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Obviously you didn’t understand. Shall I try typing it<br>
more like<br>
Yours? So then you can<br>
maybe understand…</p>
<p>I wasn’t saying that Opera was insulting to music. I said that is one way of insulting music.’</p>
<p>If I wanted to Insult music,<br>
It wouldn’t be by posting an<br>
unfinished guitar design.</p>
<p>If I wanted to Insuld music,<br>
I would say something like<br>
Opera sucks.</p>
<p>Make sense? or is your mind still full of hot air?</p>
<p>Totally right about the Disney thing. I can’t stand Disney.</p>
<p>What kind of artist are you though to sit there are criticize Pop music, and Rap? Those are 2 of the most popular genres. 2 of the best!</p>
<p>My favorite genre is Punk Rock, but the band that I am playing in, with actual band members and what not… We are Rock. Thats it. No screamo, nothing like that.</p>
<p>We were going to go to Spiriti West Coast 2010, but Our drummer might be quitting because he might have to move away. (and don’t try to turn that into another arguement.)<br>
He isn’t “moving” because he wants to get away. If he ends up moving, it’s because there is no place for him to stay here, he is 18 now, his parents kicked him out. He can’t live with any of us.</p>
<p>Where is your talent going? Youtube?</p>
<p>(I designed that Guitar serveral years ago in Middle School, because I was bored.)<br>
It wasn’t exactly meant to be a “Serious” Guitar. I seriously wonder about you people. You ever laugh? Ever have fun outside of the computer?</p>

<p>i’m not ven kidding, it might of tooken me 8 hours or so to make,<br>
but i was getting used to the program,<br>
i don’t know about you, but i never show off my work until i’m done.</p>
<p>but really,  cheese…?<br>
why would u make a cheese guitar?<br>
what’s next? a guitar in the shape of a dick?</p>
<p>and actually,<br>
even the my guitar that i made in the link isn’t done yet,</p>
<p>i havn’t added strings, a strap bolt/nut (ii forget the name)<br>
the wiring, the whammy bar, and tons of other shit could be added,</p>
<p>idk…<br>
i just wish that u wouldnt have made it a “cheese” guitar,<br>
it just insults guitars, and saying your in a “rock band” kinda proves how even more childish you are,<br>
because u probably don’t take it seriosuly if u made this kinda model,<br>
not only that, but you just said rock…<br>
u probably mistooken it for grundge/thrash/metal/heavy metal/death metal/alternative etc. etc.</p>
<p>and oprah isnt a disgrace to music,</p>
<p>pop is…<br>
along with rap and all that gay stuff<br>
most music nowadays sucks,</p>
<p>especially bands that are made by frigging walt disney &gt;.&lt;  like the gay jonas brothers</p>

              <p>It’s not done yet you guys. I know it doesn’t have a headstock. I know it doesn’t have frets, or strings. I know that it doesn’t look professional yet. 1st off, that was one of the very first models that I made by myself. regardless of what everybody else thinks. I think I did a pretty good job for not knowing much about the program, and having it be my first.<br>
Surely all these other guitars look nicer. But did you guys draw out the guitars? No, you took a picture of one that has already been made, tracing over it, then put it all together. You guys didn’t design the guitars. I designed this Cheese Guitar, and the other guitars that I’ve posted. Forgive me for thinking that I would give you the image now.</p>
<p>and for you FYI.</p>
<p>If that is what you call insulting music… What do you see as music? It’s a graphic!<br>
Not to mention… What kindof musician would I be to insult music?<br>
I’m not going to say the name of it on this forum, but I happen to be in a rock band.<br>
If you don’t believe me, sucks for you. I guess you don’t believe me then.</p>
<p>I believe the real insult of music is crap like Opera. Don’t even deserve to be called music.</p>
<p>-That is me, “Insulting” music.</p>
<p>Overall. I think it’s safe to say that a true artist of ANY kind wouldn’t just criticize anything. To say that it needs to be finished before posting is one thing. To sit there a say that i’m insulting music by posting an unifished guitar design… Thats not professional.</p>
