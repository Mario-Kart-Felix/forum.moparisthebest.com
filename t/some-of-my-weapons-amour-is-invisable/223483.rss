    <description>Some of my weapons/amour are invisable, you can right click them and you see the name etc. but when there in your invertory there invisable and there invisable when you weild them also. also when you get them as a drop on the minimap you can see the red icon but you cant see it on the ground, any help would be great, Mitch.

an exsample for an item which is invisable is bandos god sword.</description>
