    <title>One question why?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/one-question-why/395039</link>
    <description>so i heard about hvd and seen that their projected cost is around $15k. i was like i understand since its not a released technology, i wanted to see how drives compare today. i found this: [url=http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227581]http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227581[/url] my question is why the hell would u pay $10k for a 512 gig ssd? idk if im over looking something but if its extremely fast couldnt you just hook two 512 gb ssds in raid 0(it would cost about the same though to go with raid 2 and 512 gb.)? they at least could have made it pci-e x16. what if they used up two pci-e x16 slots(ive also heard of x32 but havent seen it)?</description>
