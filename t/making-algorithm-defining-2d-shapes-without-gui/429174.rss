    <title>Making Algorithm/ Defining 2D Shapes without GUI</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-algorithm-defining-2d-shapes-without-gui/429174</link>
    <description>This is partly connected to my simulation topic, but kind different. I need help defining primarily Rectangles and Line segments. I am not using Gui for this either, rather just numbers and charts in Excel. If anyone with 2D Shape experience could help that would be awesome. Partly for my simulation, partly for just expanding my knowledge. (Willing to TV Respected and trustful members.) For the algorithm part, i need a method to count how many times the molecule pass through the membrane and it counts and adds up until the server tick grabs it and resets. My java knowledge is not this extensive so I do need help. I am currently learning IO.</description>
