              <p>Sorry I have fixed the client and the cache now downloads from my dedicated server.</p>
<p>Its the open world approach.</p>
<p>Most server shut down within a week. The only way to solving the lack of players problems is being online all the time 24/7 with a dedicate host with 1gp port what we have. Over time player will realise this server is not going anywhere they will start to feel like the server is stable and reliable. I love open world server. Im sorry but I cant cope with small confined spaces.</p>
<p>This server has only been online less than a day, in time the community will grown and with it new players will join daily and soon 100 plus players will be playing.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for replying love to hear back from you guys. Hope to see you all online. If anyone has anymore comments please feel free to pm me here. Im also going to add more pictures in the next hour.</p>
<p>Thanks once again Mutley Aka Enyo.</p>

              <p>So are you trying to go with that theme where it is completely open world where everyone is spread out? More like real runescape? or more of everyone smooshed together in edgeville type of thing?</p>
<p>Also how many players are you averaging at the moment?</p>
<p>It’s just my personal feeling about it  but its hard for me to stay in those open world rsps’s  where there is only 4 players online and you never see them. I get very bored and people just quit within first 30 minutes of gameplay because the lack of interaction with one another so the player base never grows.</p>
<p>How are you going to face and handle that problem?</p>
