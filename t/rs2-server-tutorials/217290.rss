    <title>RS2 Server Tutorials</title>

    <description>Okay, now a lot of you are complaining about why your tutorials are forever being locked because they don&#39;t follow the Coding Conventions.

I have decided to open up a new section on that rule. If your tutorial is locked, you are welcome to rewrite the code, and send the whole tutorial to a member of staff, and they will see if it is valid, if so, you will be permitted to repost it.

Now that that section has been purged, we have decided to really hammer down and get it up to scratch.

EDIT: There is no punishment for sending a rewritten tutorial.</description>
