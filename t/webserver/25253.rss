    <description>Okay so here is my problem.

I have made a server on my computer and it works fine, no compile errors. I played on it, everything is how i wanted it to be. And now i want to upload it, and get it to work on my website. I have all the server files uploaded, and have tried to connect to the address the server files are in, but still no luck.

If anyone could help me i&#39;d greatly appreciate it  :)

Thanks alot
