    <title>How to use hamachi AKA ham</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-use-hamachi-aka-ham/46384</link>
    <description>Ok....donwload hamachi-witch is a network to go on other peoples servers/buisness chat rooms etc etc.Open it,and once it&#39;s loaded,click on the triange.Select-join an existing network.Then,where it says &quot;netowork name&quot; fill in the name of the network.Where it says &quot;network pass&quot;,fill in the pass.

Example: you go on a server advertisement,and it IS online,you have the server IP checked,port checked,but STILL can&#39;t get in and it is online.Well,open/restore hamachi,click on the triange-join network,read the advertisement,find where it says &quot;HAM: network: *ham network name here* and fill that into your network name space.Where it says &quot;HAM network pass: fill in the pass of the network,and but that in the network pass space..Then,check the port and IP,and log in-BAM you&#39;r in.

Hope this helps :). 

PS: It&#39;s not just for servers,it&#39;s for other gaming,buisness chat-rooms,communication,ANYTHING ONLINE-YOU NAME IT :)

PPS: I know theres a guide on how to use hamachi already,but,this isn&#39;t leeched or anything,I didn&#39;t even read the other guide.
