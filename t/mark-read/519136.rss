    <title>&quot;Mark Read&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mark-read/519136</link>
    <description>If you click mark read at the bottom of a specific board index it marks read for both the index of that board and all sub boards. I am suggesting a profile option where you can choose to have it happen with both main board and sub board or just the main board.

I.E.

I don&#39;t generally look at the server developments unless it&#39;s one I noticed I have already posted on but I do look at the development team threads. I can go down to the bottom and lose my spot of checking threads on server development teams.</description>

This. An unnotify button or something. I’ve been thinking about this for a long time and also thought about posting about it but i never got around to it.</p>
