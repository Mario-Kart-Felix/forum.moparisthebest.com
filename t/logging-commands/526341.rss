    <description>Hey guys, I want to make a log that stores all commands the players use and all trades that go on. There has been some hacking lately on a server I co own. I need to help figure out who is hacking and who is receiving the items considering I&#39;m not online to deal with it all the time. My server console does not show this log, I just want a log that sends the info to a notepad or something in the server, if that&#39;s possible. I&#39;d love it if you guys could help</description>
