    <title>Did she like me?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/did-she-like-me/424125</link>
    <description>So I have this female friend who I&#39;ve been friends with since very early on in the school year. We&#39;ll call her A. A and I have told each other things that we&#39;ve told very little (or even no) people. We&#39;ve become pretty good friends throughout the year. At one point I had quite the crush on her and would write and publish poems about me liking her on my website (pretty decent poems if you ask me, but I later deleted them because she got me to give her the website link and I was too afraid of what she&#39;d do if she saw them). Anyway, later on I gave up with my crush on her because I highly doubted she&#39;d ever like a guy like me, and I eventually started going out with this girl that we&#39;ll call B. So a couple weeks later, B and I broke up, and I was pretty sad, and found a fuck buddy to cheer me up for a little while. So since me and A talk about everything, I told her about the break up and how I was feeling pretty shitty about it, but that I&#39;ve been feeling a bit better because I have a fuck buddy to keep my mind off of B for the time being. At that point A&#39;s smile kind of faded and she said &quot;Oh..&quot; and something felt different at that point. It wasn&#39;t a pissed &quot;Oh..&quot;, but more like a sad &quot;I was about to tell you something, but it doesn&#39;t matter now&quot; type of &quot;Oh..&quot;. And the conversation faded kind of quickly after that, and after a minute or two she said she was gonna go hang out with some of her (girl) friends, and left. And here we are today.
So do you think she liked me and I ended her crush on me, or what was the deal? Because I kind of liked her still and now I feel like an assdick :(</description>

              <p>So I have this female friend who I’ve been friends with since very early on in the school year. We’ll call her A. A and I have told each other things that we’ve told very little (or even no) people. We’ve become pretty good friends throughout the year. At one point I had quite the crush on her and would write and publish poems about me liking her on my website (pretty decent poems if you ask me, but I later deleted them because she got me to give her the website link and I was too afraid of what she’d do if she saw them). Anyway, later on I gave up with my crush on her because I highly doubted she’d ever like a guy like me, and I eventually started going out with this girl that we’ll call B. So a couple weeks later, B and I broke up, and I was pretty sad, and found a fuck buddy to cheer me up for a little while. So since me and A talk about everything, I told her about the break up and how I was feeling pretty shitty about it, but that I’ve been feeling a bit better because I have a fuck buddy to keep my mind off of B for the time being. At that point A’s smile kind of faded and she said “Oh…” and something felt different at that point. It wasn’t a pissed “Oh…”, but more like a sad “I was about to tell you something, but it doesn’t matter now” type of “Oh…”. And the conversation faded kind of quickly after that, and after a minute or two she said she was gonna go hang out with some of her (girl) friends, and left. And here we are today.<br>
So do you think she liked me and I ended her crush on me, or what was the deal? Because I kind of liked her still and now I feel like an assdick <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
