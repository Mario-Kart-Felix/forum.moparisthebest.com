    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problems-with-jdk-please-help/239920</link>
    <description>Sorry if there are already topic&#39;s about this, but can&#39;t find any.

well, this is my problem. i can connect on 127.0.1(localhost right?) but my friends cant connect on my server ip. I had it working on JDK 6u7 but reinstalled my pc so i need to download an new java. the problem is there is only 6u10 (the second on the list from java download section) and i is only an OFFLINE JDK (picture, hard to read but try:P). when i dont have online version of JDK  my friends can&#39;t join right? anybody knows where to get an ONLINE version of JDK or has an older version of JDK please post it. i&#39;ll be very happy with any comments

Thanks already for LOOKING this (btw im a nub coder so please no comments like &quot;noob&quot; etc)sorry for bad english.......
