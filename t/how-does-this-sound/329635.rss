    <title>How does this sound?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-does-this-sound/329635</link>
    <description>A fine, BASIC, simple server source sound? Right now I am making a RyScape source(cleaned delta by tatemo was my source), but I am not putting customs. Honestly who wants a pink whip? Or a Different colored platebody? Right now I&#39;ve got this down (only worked on it for a day or two)
-Added skillcapes
-Added hoods
-Added some commands
What I will do in the next week:
-Soon be adding all godswords and armor like bandos...(should be done with that by tommorrow)
-Changing home to lumbridge; where I think it should be.
-Adding shops and training spots
...
Basically I&#39;m making a simple server source without all the gay NPC&#39;s, objects, and customs that take forever to completely edit out.
My question is would you download it as a source?

Also if anyone would like to help, I would appriciate it because I don&#39;t have a lot of free time(thats why it will take a week to add shops, training areas, and some weps!). Just message me if interested.</description>
