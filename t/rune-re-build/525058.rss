    <description>[center][size=14pt]Rune Re-build[/size][/center]

Rune-rebuild is a RuneScape style framework I have begun developing based on the standard #317 protocol. I plan to continue it during my off time this summer. Any constructive criticism on the design would be much appreciated.

[size=15pt]Current Networking Design[/size]

     Connections:
Currently a single Thread is being executed with the ScheduledExecutorService upon start up to accept incoming connection requests in a blocking manner. The request is then sent to a HashMap where it will be stored and finally decoded. If the login process is successful the connection will then be moved to another HashMap where the active players are held. If failed, the connection will be removed from its current map and the socket will be cut.

     Packet Transmission: 
     Incoming Packets will be decoded on a separate Thread under the same conditions as the previous Thread, then dispensed to an array to be abstracted out. This design is not final as I may choose to load the definitions externally in the future.

[size=15pt]Entity Design Map[/size]

       This the entity system I plan to incorporate, however I would love suggestions or possible improvements as long as there constructive. This will now have a Thread also making the total count three. This Thread (Executed the same as the others) will handle entity updating.
       Entity
            MobileEntity
                 Player
                 NPC
            StillEntity
                 Object
                 GroundItem

[size=15pt]Event System[/size]
     It is an external library, but its very small and lightweight. This will be used for processing actions such as skilling, combat, and other player attributes without clustering our Thread for entity updating.
