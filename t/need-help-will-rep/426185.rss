    <title>Need help - Will Rep++</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-will-rep/426185</link>
    <description>I have a big problem and have been trying to sort it out for ages but haven&#39;t had any success. I am using this source: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,459671.0.html

My problem: The shops don&#39;t work. When I try to buy something it just freezes for 3 seconds. I have tried lots of thing but none of them have worked. I think its something to do with ShopHandler.java but I don&#39;t know. Its a codeusa source. Does anyone know where I can get a codeusa source so I can compare them? But I would prefer to keep this source so can anyone help me with this? I will rep++.

Also does anyone know if I can get this somewhere else cos the source link is broken and it looks like quite a good source.
