    <title>Is This Good?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-this-good/431528</link>
    <description>Well.. all I know at the moment is that my mom&#39;s purchased me a Desktop Computer in compensation for the old one she broke that has 8GB of Ram and a Terabyte hard drive. Basically I want to know if that will be enough to keep me at 30 FPS at least on Runescape? I don&#39;t know anything about computer parts and all that jazz and I know many of you do so it&#39;d be nice to get a heads up on what my gaming experience is going to be like for now on, thanks. 

And for smart asses that are going to tell me to log on Runescape and see, I don&#39;t have the computer yet and I won&#39;t have it probably for another couple days or so.</description>

              <p>Mom suprised me and actually got it on the way home and I can happily say it runs runescape in the highest detail at 50 FPS.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
