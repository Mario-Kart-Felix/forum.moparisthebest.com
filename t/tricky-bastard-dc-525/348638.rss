    <description>Hello, i got a server, wich is 525, and it have an annoying error that i can´t fix.
The problem is, when i cast a spell, then drink a potion, I Disconnect.
Stupid right?
Well i think that problem is the potions, because i replaced with a normal itemselect.java (that file contains the potions i think, i also think that potions are on player.java too.) and the glitch was gone. 

So please moparscape community, Help me. Heres the files Below.


Thank you.</description>
