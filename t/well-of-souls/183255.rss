    <description>Another fun &quot;rpg&quot;. It allows you to pick and choose your world, which is basically a whole game. The main world is called Evergreen [it is the most played] and is heavily populated. It is 2.5D, and is very fun. It is on/off line. Sorry for the smallish review, I&#39;m off to play it :).

I&#39;m a fast trainer, level 80 Conqueror now.
Also if anyone wants to play, I can train them up a bit :)
If you get nothing out of the game, you might as well try Dow Bones [one way to make LOTS of money] and another way to have fun. Also, WoS Tactics is coming out soon, another thing for Tactics/strategy fans.</description>
