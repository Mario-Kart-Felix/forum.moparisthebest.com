    <description>Tittle says it all, [b][i]Most[/i][/b] of my commands don&#39;t work and i don&#39;t know what could be wrong...Source is Exilium and here&#39;s an example command that doesn&#39;t work. :
[code]if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;givedonor&quot;) &amp;&amp; c.playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;jage&quot;)) {
				try {	
					String playerToMod = playerCommand.substring(10);
					for(int i = 0; i &lt; Config.MAX_PLAYERS; i++) {
						if(Server.playerHandler.players[i] != null) {
							if(Server.playerHandler.players[i].playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(playerToMod)) {
								Client c2 = (Client)Server.playerHandler.players[i];
								c2.sendMessage(&quot;You have been given donator status by &quot; + c.playerName);
								c2.playerRights = 4;
								c2.isDonator = 1;
								c2.logout();
								
								break;
							} 
						}
					}
				} catch(Exception e) {
					c.sendMessage(&quot;Player Must Be Offline.&quot;);
				}			
			}[/code]</description>

<p>It’s probably already in an array somewhere within his client. If I remember correctly, which I probably don’t, most people added titles via client sided, then used an int (server sided) to assign what is what.</p>

<p>This is not just this topic, almost every comment is format this, format that. Half the people in this section just want help with their command, not a lesson on efficiency and readable code.</p>
<p>It actually turned out you were wrong, as I suggested in the first place. Adding brackets to the end of the file does not fix these problems so telling him to do so is a complete throw off. No matter what he added to the end of the file he still got the same error.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Okay? Then I was wrong. People can be wrong. It was trial and error with what I was doing.<br>
If you think everyone in this section needs help (since apparently I cannot give any) you can gladly start helping everyone in the section, and I’ll stop.<br>
I try and give help to as much people as possible, and me telling them to format it is just a tip. It gives the code readability so it will be easier to read and fix the problem.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes but you focus too much on that rather than answering the OP’s actual question.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span> No problem, keep going with that portforward, it will work.</p>

<p>Man every single one of your comments is about formatting or about telling people how shit their code is. Get a grip and actually help them. You are, after all, a server helper?</p>
<p>Quit thinking you’re gods gift. People may not have the skills to make their code as efficient as possible, but I’m sure he’s not aiming for that.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span>, don’t bother with all of the cleaning, it’d be better but not needed. Focus on your command. Try and figure out what’s causing the command to not work. Print some stuff to the console to try and trace where it’s not working. I came across a similar issue a while back and it was because I was using</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (command.equals</code></pre>
<p>It worked with</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (command.startsWith</code></pre>
<p>I’ll gladly help you clean it up a little and sort the problem, send me a message.</p>

Change this from “.startsWith” to “.equalsIgnoreCase”, remove the other 2 “playerCommand.startsWith(“LSP”) || playerCommand.startsWith(“Lsp”)”</p>
