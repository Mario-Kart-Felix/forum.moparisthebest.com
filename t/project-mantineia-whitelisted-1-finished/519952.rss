    <description>[center]Hello guys, i&#39;m looking too start a minecraft server. Me and my friend have had a passion for it for awhile, I&#39;ve got some money to invest! I just have decided to buy a server host, and it&#39;s been made official. Now heres what I need. I need my spawn made, i&#39;m currently working on the Rules section.

The server is currently whitelisted, Since I don&#39;t have any protection mods installed, so how you get access to the server is you have to add me on skype... I will decide if you should be able to join or not and if you&#39;re trust-able.. I&#39;m very passionate about running a Minecraft server..

I know i&#39;m not very active on these forums, but i&#39;ve been registered for awhile. I&#39;m going to sound hypocritical about how trustworthy I want people to be.


Heres a list on how people will be ranked..
