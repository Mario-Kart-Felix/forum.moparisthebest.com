    <description>Well, I made another member of my forum an admin. A member that joined after him...

[code]Adrian &lt;3&#39;s Alexandra =D says:
i worked my ASS OFF to get overr HALF of the community, sucked up to you, did everything i could for it, and CrnJacker gets it straight away when hes been here less than me.i really dont think thats even fair.
Anthony says:
Your just like LeScape
Anthony says:
You&#39;re*
Adrian &lt;3&#39;s Alexandra =D says:
its just unfair..
Adrian &lt;3&#39;s Alexandra =D says:
dont even say its not because i even reffered Crn
Anthony says:
What does that have to do with anything?
Anthony says:
Being the members there that has been there the longest has nothing to do with it
Adrian &lt;3&#39;s Alexandra =D says:
i did my job
Adrian &lt;3&#39;s Alexandra =D says:
i was one of the most mature there in my &quot;dutys&quot;
Anthony says:
Crn did his job, and more.
Adrian &lt;3&#39;s Alexandra =D says:
wow..just..wow...
Adrian &lt;3&#39;s Alexandra =D says:
seriously, i really thought of you as a friend. and you just HAD to pick today didnt you. the worst fucking day of my life so far and just..
Adrian &lt;3&#39;s Alexandra =D says:
wow
Anthony says:
If the admin was the person that has been there the longest, it would be Hidendra.
Anthony says:
But that&#39;s now how it works.
Anthony says:
not*
Adrian &lt;3&#39;s Alexandra =D says:
i told u, idc who was there longest
Adrian &lt;3&#39;s Alexandra =D says:
i THOUGHT it was someone who contributed to the community
Anthony says:
It is based on moderation skills too
Adrian &lt;3&#39;s Alexandra =D says:
or is picked by polls.
Anthony says:
I am trying to make just babbelen a democratic community
Anthony says:
Where members can decide what should be done for the community
Adrian &lt;3&#39;s Alexandra =D says:
democratic, where you make CrnJacker admin outta nowhere?
Adrian &lt;3&#39;s Alexandra =D says:
didnt even say anything?
Adrian &lt;3&#39;s Alexandra =D says:
just outta the blue
Anthony says:
So? Niall and Lothy were both made admins like that?
Adrian &lt;3&#39;s Alexandra =D says:
doesnt MITB and MoparScape fail tho? have a shitty community?
Adrian &lt;3&#39;s Alexandra =D says:
i havent seen a single flamewar.
Anthony says:
Only cause people like you releasing your shitty sources, thinking it&#39;s better than everyone else&#39;s
Adrian &lt;3&#39;s Alexandra =D says:
ive never said its better.
Adrian &lt;3&#39;s Alexandra =D says:
dont ever try to talk to me, or my girlfriend again. goodbye.
