              <p>[quote=“daman15jake, post:2, topic:155308”]Getting A Web Site<br>
This can be one of the hardest parts of this whole tutorial (to your wallet), but also one of the most important. I will be telling you how to get a web site. Free web-sites are not what you want to use (unless it is nationvoice)! If you want to buy a web site (domain &amp; hosting) I suggest buying it all through GoDaddy But there are many other places to buy your web site. If you don’t want to buy a web site then use Nationvoice</p>
<p>Getting your client to look for images on the web<br>
After you sign up for a website you must edit the file Class30_sub2_sub1_sub1 so it looks on the web for all the images. Sadly costom sprites will not work with web-clients.<br>
Download the new Class30_Sub2_Sub1_Sub1.java Here<br>
Save that file to the clients folder (if it asks to replace, which it will, hit yes).</p>
<p>Now you must upload the clients background image, to a image host. Here are some good ones.</p>
<p>Code:<br>
“Image image = ”</p>
<p>Replace That Whole Line With</p>
<p>Code:<br>
Image image = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getImage(new URL(“imageurlhere”));</p>
<p>Change the imageurlhere to the url of your client background</p>
<p>Then Compile the client.</p>
<p>Jaring &amp; Signing The Client<br>
The first thing you must do is download the jar maker/signer Here</p>
<p>Then clear EVERY thing out of the manifest folder.<br>
If you don’t have anything in your manifest folder then skip that step.</p>
<p>Next run the jar maker/signer, and open the JarMaker tab.<br>
Set the output directory to your client folder. change the application.jar to anything you want. BUT KEEP THE .JAR PART!!!<br>
Set the input directory to your clients folder.<br>
Then hit the manifest template button, for the main class put client<br>
Then hit the set manifest button, then hit the Create Jar! button</p>
<p>Congrats! You just made a jar!<br>
Now to Sign it.<br>
Signing the jar, basicly tells who made the jar, and what the jars name is.</p>
<p>Signing the Jar<br>
Hit the Jar Signer tab.<br>
For the out put file put the path to your clients folder, and change the application.jar to whateveryouwant.jar<br>
For the signed Jar file put signed_JARNAME<br>
For The Jarsigner path, put the path to your jarsigner.<br>
It should be something like what is allready there.<br>
Then hit the Generate Keystore button/<br>
For keytool location put the path to keytool.exe (should be something like what they have).<br>
For output keystore file put the path to your client folder, and put Keystore as the file name.<br>
Fill in all of the other boxes (self explained). Except the City, Province, country (unless you want to).<br>
And hit generate keystore.<br>
Then for the Keystore file, put the path to the one you just made (should be in clients folder).<br>
And fill out the Keystore alias, Public key, and private key (there what ever you set them as).<br>
And hit Sign Jar!</p>
<p>If that appears when you run the jar (online), then the jar is signed correctly</p>
<p>Your almost done!<br>
Now, upload the jar file to the website you got earlier.</p>
<p>Open up a blank notepad document and put this in.</p>
<p>Code:</p>

WEBCLIENT NAME



<p>Change the WEBCLIEBT NAME to the name of the webclient (or what ever you want the pages name to be)<br>
and the JAR URL to the url to the jar.</p>
<p>That is just basic html. You can get more html help at <a href="http://w3schools.com/html/default.asp" rel="nofollow noopener">http://w3schools.com/html/default.asp</a>.</p>
<p>Save that as client.html and upload it to your site.</p>
<p>Congrats you have just turned your downloadable client into a webclient![/quote]</p>
<p>You leeched that of m.dog, Please don’t copy and paste already made tutorials, Just give him the link to it.</p>

              <p>Getting A Web Site<br>
This can be one of the hardest parts of this whole tutorial (to your wallet), but also one of the most important. I will be telling you how to get a web site. Free web-sites are not what you want to use (unless it is nationvoice)! If you want to buy a web site (domain &amp; hosting) I suggest buying it all through GoDaddy But there are many other places to buy your web site. If you don’t want to buy a web site then use Nationvoice</p>
<p>Getting your client to look for images on the web<br>
After you sign up for a website you must edit the file Class30_sub2_sub1_sub1 so it looks on the web for all the images. Sadly costom sprites will not work with web-clients.<br>
Download the new Class30_Sub2_Sub1_Sub1.java Here<br>
Save that file to the clients folder (if it asks to replace, which it will, hit yes).</p>
<p>Now you must upload the clients background image, to a image host. Here are some good ones.</p>
<p>Code:<br>
“Image image = ”</p>
<p>Replace That Whole Line With</p>
<p>Code:<br>
Image image = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getImage(new URL(“imageurlhere”));</p>
<p>Change the imageurlhere to the url of your client background</p>
<p>Then Compile the client.</p>
<p>Jaring &amp; Signing The Client<br>
The first thing you must do is download the jar maker/signer Here</p>
<p>Then clear EVERY thing out of the manifest folder.<br>
If you don’t have anything in your manifest folder then skip that step.</p>
<p>Next run the jar maker/signer, and open the JarMaker tab.<br>
Set the output directory to your client folder. change the application.jar to anything you want. BUT KEEP THE .JAR PART!!!<br>
Set the input directory to your clients folder.<br>
Then hit the manifest template button, for the main class put client<br>
Then hit the set manifest button, then hit the Create Jar! button</p>
<p>Congrats! You just made a jar!<br>
Now to Sign it.<br>
Signing the jar, basicly tells who made the jar, and what the jars name is.</p>
<p>Signing the Jar<br>
Hit the Jar Signer tab.<br>
For the out put file put the path to your clients folder, and change the application.jar to whateveryouwant.jar<br>
For the signed Jar file put signed_JARNAME<br>
For The Jarsigner path, put the path to your jarsigner.<br>
It should be something like what is allready there.<br>
Then hit the Generate Keystore button/<br>
For keytool location put the path to keytool.exe (should be something like what they have).<br>
For output keystore file put the path to your client folder, and put Keystore as the file name.<br>
Fill in all of the other boxes (self explained). Except the City, Province, country (unless you want to).<br>
And hit generate keystore.<br>
Then for the Keystore file, put the path to the one you just made (should be in clients folder).<br>
And fill out the Keystore alias, Public key, and private key (there what ever you set them as).<br>
And hit Sign Jar!</p>
<p>If that appears when you run the jar (online), then the jar is signed correctly</p>
<p>Your almost done!<br>
Now, upload the jar file to the website you got earlier.</p>
<p>Open up a blank notepad document and put this in.</p>
<p>Code:</p>

WEBCLIENT NAME



<p>Change the WEBCLIEBT NAME to the name of the webclient (or what ever you want the pages name to be)<br>
and the JAR URL to the url to the jar.</p>
<p>That is just basic html. You can get more html help at <a href="http://w3schools.com/html/default.asp" rel="nofollow noopener">http://w3schools.com/html/default.asp</a>.</p>
<p>Save that as client.html and upload it to your site.</p>
<p>Congrats you have just turned your downloadable client into a webclient!</p>
