    <title>[PI] Curses Interface</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-curses-interface/380766</link>
    <description>First off, I am not sure if this is only server-sided. I ripped the curses etc from DSPK. My problem is that using curses doesn&#39;t drain prayer points. I am pretty sure the method for curse draining is added. The other problem is that when you switch to curses, your prayer level in the prayer interface goes to 99/99. I can provide any files/images you might need to help.</description>
