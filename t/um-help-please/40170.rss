    <description>                                            :confused: :mad: PROBLEM :mad: :confused:

Once I open the client, it loads about -23% of &quot;game loading&quot; then seems to shut down and dissapears, leaving me only with the bot window open saying &quot;press any key&quot;, I press a key and that shuts down also.
I&#39;ve been searching numerous web-sites on help for this type of query and yet have not found a single person with the same problem. Also when I try to open the compile-scripts I recieve the phrase:
&quot; &quot;Javac&quot; is not recognized &quot;.

I am well and truly stuck at this moment. I have downloaded the &quot;moparscape 3.2 version&quot; and am assuming I have alredy got the latest Java ( will try to download once again ).

I would appreciate any helpful advice towards this problem greatly, if you guys wouldn&#39;t mind helping me.

       
     Thank You
