    <description>first question that i need help with is this, My checkbank command does not work if the player account name has a space between their name like &quot;::checkbank master pkr&quot; this will not work, how would i set this up to fix that?


[code]				if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;checkbank&quot;)) {
				String[] args = playerCommand.split(&quot; &quot;);
				for(int i = 0; i &lt; Config.MAX_PLAYERS; i++)
				{
					Client o = (Client) Server.playerHandler.players[i];
					if(Server.playerHandler.players[i] != null)
					{
						if(Server.playerHandler.players[i].playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(args[1]))
						{
                 						c.getPA().otherBank(c, o);
						break;
						}
					}
				}
			}[/code]


2nd question i need help with, Like how pk in wildy is setup so that u need 3items to attack someone, how would i do the same thing so when you try open a gate, it checks that you are wearing the set amount of items required to pass through it?
like say you need 4 items to pass through, if you are wearing 4+ items you go through and if you are wearing any less than 4 it sends a message like &quot;you need 4 items to pass through&quot;, the message part is easy but how do i add the req on the gate?</description>

ok so i searched for the wildy part and this is what i found…</p>
<p><code>			if (c.getPA().getWearingAmount() &lt; 3 &amp;&amp; c.duelStatus &lt; 1) {
				c.sendMessage("You must be wearing at least 3 items to attack someone.");
				resetPlayerAttack();
				return;
			}</code><br>
so what i want to do is transfer this somehow onto my teleports, so it will only teleport you if you are wearing 3items+<br>
and i tried this,</p>
<p><code>				} else if (c.teleAction == 3 &amp;&amp; c.getPA().getWearingAmount() &lt; 3) {
					//corporal beast
					c.getPA().spellTeleport(3304, 9375, 0);
c.sendMessage("You teleport to the Corporeal beast!");
</code></p>
<p>to no help it failed, umm im not sure what to do? help please<br>
[/quote]That’s teleporting people if they have under 3 items…</p>
<p>You used the wrong operator.[/quote]</p>
<p>yeah thanks for that, its good now hey how would i set it up so that if you click the teleport and have under the requred amount of items it will close the tele options and send the message “you need bla bla”</p>
