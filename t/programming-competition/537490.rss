    <title>Programming competition?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/programming-competition/537490</link>
    <description>What would you think about having a programming competition? We could give them a complex rule and they must make a program that we can run and then verify if their program meets the rule for a number of cases.

[b]Example:[/b] 
Most systems prevent users from registering with simple passwords, in order to ensure that their users are correctly protected. One rule to detect &quot;simple&quot; passwords is to reject the password if it contains any sequence of characters followed immediately followed by the same sentence. Make a program to check a password (1 to 10 uppercase letters), and print &quot;Rejected&quot; if the password is invalid, or &quot;Accepted&quot; if the password is valid.

[b]APPLE[/b] - Rejected (P is repeated)
[b]NONONSENSE[/b] - Rejected (NO is repeated)
[b]PASWORD[/b] - Accepted
[b]ONION[/b] - Accepted (ON is not immediately repeated)</description>

              <p>Are we going to evaluate the code? This problem would take a few days to plan and create, I thought it would be better if we were to simply have a list of passwords that we would test their program with, and we award the first person to provide us with a fully functioning solution with the winning spot.</p>
