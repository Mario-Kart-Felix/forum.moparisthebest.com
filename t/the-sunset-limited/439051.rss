    <title>The Sunset Limited</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-sunset-limited/439051</link>
    <description>This is a TV movie based on a play, and in my opinion was the best film of 2011. Probably the best movie I&#39;ve seen in quite a few years, and that&#39;s saying something considering the cast comprises of just 2 men, Samuel L Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones.

Simple enough story line and setting; &quot;Two men in an apartment with their opposing beliefs&quot;.

If you like 12 Angry Men, The Man from Earth, and other similar films which rely on good dialogue in a single setting then this is a must see.</description>

              <p>I know this post is a few days old, but after seeing this, I decided to go ahead and watch it.<br>
And I agree with it being a great film, the dialogue is amazing and for being a two man film, it actually kept my attention throughout.  This whole thing really hit me hard considering these are the same things I have grown up around going to Catholic school for 12 years and hearing the multiple beliefs about everything.  And although I’ve now seen the film, I am tempted to go out and read the play itself just so I can see everything that Cormac McCarthy wrote and read his dialogue for myself.</p>
