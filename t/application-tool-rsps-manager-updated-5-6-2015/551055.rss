    <description>[b][u][size=24pt]Travis&#39; RuneScape Private Server Manager[/size][/u][/b]

[b][u][size=14pt]Introduction[/size][/u][/b]
Hi there. You probably don&#39;t know me, or maybe you do, I&#39;m not sure how many familiar faces I&#39;ll see in a community I haven&#39;t been a part of in so long. I&#39;m Travis, also known here as JavaTC (and some other username I forgot) and I stopped coming here a long time ago. I had several thousand posts and this community gave me a lot, so I thought I&#39;d finally give something back to it. Thanks for the good times, Mopar.

[b][u][size=14pt]About the application[/size][/u][/b]
This is an application to make managing and updating clients easier for both players and developers. I made it because I&#39;ve always found myself rather annoyed at how often server owners would update their clients and how the very few launchers I&#39;ve seen for servers, they always tend to fail if the webhost is offline due to attacks and had such unnecessary flashiness. This is designed to be as simple as possible; meaning no fancy GUI or user interaction beyond the initial setup.

Because it uses arguments to gather all the information it needs, all that&#39;s really needed is a .bat file for each server you play. Whether it&#39;s provided by the server owner or created by you, it&#39;s simple to make and an example is included the the download.
[i]Note that the client must be a .jar file [s]with a direct download link for the manager to work![/s][/i]
As of now, the program supports redirected download pages. So long as it redirects to a direct download, (No mediafire or Uppit,) it can fetch the uri and download the client.

[b][u][size=14pt]Usage[/size][/u][/b]
[u]Do not just run the program! It will crash![/u] Run it via a .bat file with two arguments.
The first argument is the server name - Example &quot;YourScape&quot;
The second argument is the link to the client - Example &quot;http://yourscape.com/client.jar&quot;
Example .bat file:
[code]
@echo off
RSPSM2 &quot;YourScape&quot; &quot;http://yourscape.com/client.jar&quot;
[/code]

[b][u][size=14pt]Media[/size][/u][/b]
[spoiler]I know how it goes here, so here&#39;s some media, despite it being a console application.
(Server name and url blanked out to avoid advertisement)

As of now, I&#39;m releasing the source. To anyone interested in learning about C# or the .NET framework, this could be useful in some way. You&#39;re free to use it as you wish, though crediting me in any of your own modified builds somehow is appreciated.

</aside>
<p>It could, and some clients have, such as Vitality and their own game launcher, however a lot that I’ve seen have issues and so I created this, primarily for myself, so I could easily just launch whatever server I wanted to play at the moment without having to worry about the client not being up to date because they don’t have an automated updater. It can easily be integrated into the client, but not many ever seem to, so I compensated for that.<br>
As for mac users, if anyone truly wants it for mac, I’m willing to port it using mono or possibly rewrite it in Java despite me being far more experienced in C# than any other language. I did actually have a test Java version once but I got rather annoyed with it and scrapped it. So if any Mac/Linux users need it that badly because they don’t want to write their own, I can port it, just ask.</p>

<p>horrible, everyone can make a updater.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes, it’s a very simple project, anyone could make it in around 5 minutes if they knew what they were doing, it took me around half an hour since I was mostly just messing around with making the code as clean as I’m willing to tolerate and experimenting with a few things since I have so little time to program anything. I also added way more dialog and output than necessary, but that’s how I like my console applications.<br>
In fact, if you include all the comments and empty space, it’s under 300 lines of code. But as I said, it was mainly for personal use, I don’t expect it to be big, though I was thinking of making a GUI for it.</p>
<p>Edit: Updated the application, now supports redirecting uri/urls and is now open source.</p>

</aside>
<p>It redownloads the client each time it’s ran, therefore always keeping the client up to date. It also backs up the latest client downloaded so if the host ever goes down, it can still run the latest version you have. Not the most innovative way of doing it, I know, but after much work on a different version of this I intended to sell to servers, I decided the simplicity was better. I originally wanted it to check the current version from a text file on the server’s website but it had a lot of issues and it was a lot more difficult to make everything work properly.<br>
I know plenty of people could do better, I was just surprised that they hadn’t yet from what I’ve seen. Plus doing it this way has the advantage of it working with almost every server, so long as it has a direct download link. It doesn’t like a few, such as perfectionx and the likes, because of their client patching system, but you don’t even need it in those cases.</p>

Yeah, I thought I was too. I decided to release this though and stick around the forums some. I don’t have as much time as I used to, (seeing how my entire night after getting home consisted of this site,) but I’ll make a few posts here and there when I can. The vast majority of my time is spent with my girlfriend on skype, in college, or helping my family out now, but I’m here to stay for a while longer.</p>
