    <title>Administrator password &quot;recovery&quot; (Win7homePremium)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/administrator-password-recovery-win7homepremium/400122</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve pretty much tried almost every method of trying to gain access to the original admin account (or at the very least the password of this account) to my computer. This is because the admin of the computer deleted my account (which was not encrypted at the time due to my own stupidity). It seems when i try the backtrack linux method it doesn&#39;t work. Here is the problem with my backtrack linux method of hacking the administrator password.
&lt;blockquote&gt;(I boot to backtrack linux and enable default text mode, this version happens to be 5)
as soon as the console appears i type the following

&quot;mkdir /mnt/sda1&quot;
&quot;mount -t ntfs /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1&quot;
&quot;cd /mnt/sda1 /Windows/System32/config samdump2 SYSTEM SAM &gt; /root/list&quot;
&quot;cat /root/list | grep Administrator&quot;
(this next line of code is where the problem is, i have no idea if im typing this right or not due to my begginer knowledge)
&quot;/root/adminpassword/&quot;
(when i skip the above this next line actually does work)
&quot;cd /pentest/passwords/jtr/&quot;
(finally i type in this line of code and recieve a different error than the one stated above, saying that the directory doesnt exist)
&quot;./(my admin account) -f :NT /root/adminpassword&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Then after this method i try to use both backtrack and ophcrack the instructions to this can be seen [url=http://www.breakthesecurity.com/2011/06/how-to-hack-windows-admin-password.html] here[/url]
When i finally achieve this all i get is &quot;there is no password&quot; (im paraphrasing of course). Could this be due to an encryption the dominant admin set on the computer?

Finally i try several windows executable files that do the same, ophcrack, rainbow tables, ect... all seem to have the same issue. Is there anything i can do to solve this problem?

I already have an existing &quot;new&quot; admin account on the computer, however it is hidden with the registry and password encrypted, also there is no way to log in through the command prompt due to the existing admin disabling this for all the accounts. If only i had his knowledge -.- Any help would be great.
