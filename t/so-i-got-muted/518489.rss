              <p>That’s how Fagex works. Everyone else who curses that you report will never get muted, but when you say one damn sentence that someone doesn’t like it’s a 2 or 3 day ban. Makes no sense. Why they don’t just have the characters deleted if they don’t like it is beyond me.</p>

Yeah, there’s only 2 shown in my chat two. But the other person in the chat was a friend whom was also talking just as bad as I.<br>
Plus, the issue with that rule is there’s a lot of stretching to it since they added the filter. Stretching that isn’t clear to players.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Filter or not, the rules still apply.[/quote]<br>
When they released the filter, they talked about how the rule would be ‘modified’ because of it. But they didn’t add to what extent.</p>
<p>Also, I know my friend wasn’t muted because I talked to him in the clan chat after I had been muted.</p>

Wouldn’t the reporters chat be sent in along with the reportee’s? Thus getting him (assumed) in trouble.</p>

I hope you understand that everything we have told you is a mere guess on the core workings of the system. No one besides Jagex employees truly understands what factors are taken into consideration, or to what extent. All we can tell you is that we know for a fact it shows evidence of YOU breaking a rule; however, I can say that I still have mutes from 2010, in which I only saw the people involved in the rule broken (me and the victim), although that person’s name was censored.</p>

Only 2 people did. Me, and a kid in a friend chat.[/quote]<br>
No, you two only showed up because you were reported and he reported you. You are only going to receive evidence for the reason you were banned, not evidence for why others were banned.</p>

My point being that they didn’t show the entire chat. Everyone in that corner of the GE was talking the same way I was, so they all should have been muted too, am I right?<br>

I’m sure they reviewed the entire chat log from every person around you. They aren’t going to tell you that other people were punished for their actions, because it really isn’t your business.[/quote]<br>

How do you know that they didn’t get muted too?[/quote]<br>
I don’t. But from what I know of runescape’s report system. The chat only gets reviewed if a person is reported. I’m pretty sure I got reported by this kid because I wasn’t helping him recover from being hacked out of 50m (supposedly).</p>

Pretty sure you put [b ][/b ] in the middle of the u and the c.</p>
<p>The point isn’t that they weren’t included, because they probably got muted too. They only show your chat and the chat of the person who reported you. They’re showing you where you went wrong, not where everyone in the community did.</p>
