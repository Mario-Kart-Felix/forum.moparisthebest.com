              <p>Asking for a developer to ‘teach you’ as you work on the rsps never happens. You end up watching them do everything while you do nothing, and learn nothing.</p>
<p>Take the hands on approach. Read some Java, and then some more. And after that, maybe a bit more. Then start working on your rsps. You need, at minimal, to understand the basics of Java if you ever want to be able to go anywhere with your rsps.</p>
<p>If there’s something you don’t understand, google it before posting “I NEED HALP”. 95% of the time, there’s an answer. The other 5%? You googled it wrong.</p>
