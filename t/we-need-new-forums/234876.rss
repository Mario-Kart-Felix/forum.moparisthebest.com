    <title>We need new forums</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/we-need-new-forums/234876</link>
    <description>Like honestly everyone, this website is getting SO old!

Theres about 6 forums, and only 3 of them actually have a point of posting in, however the other 3 are the only forums you DONT GET FLAMED IN!

We need a new community
We need a new website.
We need more forums.
We NEED A BETTER COMMUNITY!

I CAN MAKE A BETTER WEBSITE THEN THIS IN FIVE MINUTES.

THIS HAS BEEN OUT FOR YEARS AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? ABUSED US!

WE NEED NEW RULES, AND MOPARSCAPE NEEDS TO GET OUT OF THE 2003 RSPS.

There is so much you could do to this website, but instead you just sit back and ban us.


I say we make new forums.

New Mods.
New Theme.

Now good fuckin&#39; bye.</description>

              <p>Well yes this forum need’s 2 be new.</p>
<p>One of my reasons why I think there must be changes:</p>
<p>My forum account is glitched.</p>
<p>I can’t see buttons only blank buttons without in it.</p>
<p>I also can’t make my own threads etc.</p>
<p>So please moparscape , fix my account or get a new forum :).</p>
<p>And I hope there will be better staff , the staff only appear if some one is flaming etc.</p>
<p>They don’t even help us.</p>
<p>I wont flame 2 the staff with this , this is only a tip <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> !</p>
<p>I hope my account will be fixed !</p>
