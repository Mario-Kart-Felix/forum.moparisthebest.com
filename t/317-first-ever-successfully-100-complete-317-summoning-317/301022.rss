    <title>[317] First ever (SUCCESSFULLY 100% COMPLETE) 317 Summoning [317]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-first-ever-successfully-100-complete-317-summoning-317/301022</link>
    <description>So, you may or may not have seen my post in the help section about this summoning problem.
Either way, I finally got it figured out! :D
So, since this problem was easily solved, I believe I&#39;ll get the credits out first.

45% to me for Making the original coding to this, and writing the tutorial.
10% to Silent CJ for helping me with the coding on making the NPC actually summon AND follow you.
10% to nobiwa666 for helping me FINALLY fix the text problem!
10% to anyone who didn&#39;t flame me/other posts during the problem.
and the remaining 25% to everyone who can follow this properly, not flame this topic, and NOT LEECH.

I believe I&#39;m the first person to accomplish this, so, let&#39;s begin.

Difficulty:
4/10 - For the ability to properly follow instructions. 
NOTE: This may not work for EVERYONE, as this was somewhat a spur-of-the-moment coding, but it works for me.
Files changed: Client.java (MAKE A BACKUP -- Don&#39;t complain to me on how you failed and it ruined your server. Backups are there for a reason!)
Sources tested on:
(I tested this on multiple sources so as to get a good understanding of if it&#39;ll work)
-Allstarscapev2
-Project Czar
-Devo v2.7
-My own, of course (no base)

[b][u]Intro[/u]
As you might know, I had some difficulty figuring this out, but after a long 6 days, I finally got it!
Thanks to many moparscapians who helped me with this problem, and some of the others still awaiting help in the Server Help Section. ^^&quot;[/b]

[b][u]Instructions[/u]
[u]PLEASE READ CARFULLY[/u][/b]

Step 1: (Optional, but I&#39;m not sure if this is needed)
Add this coding under any other /* ------ */ Codes. If you don&#39;t have it, don&#39;t worry.
[code]/*SUMMONING*/
	
public int hasset = 0;
public int oldclick = 0;
public int sameclick = 0;
public int instantkill = 0;[/code]
I added it in just incase it was needed, so I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s absolutely needed for THIS.

Step 2: Setting up the commands. (I suggest you start MAKING these codes in a text document so as not to mess up your client.java -- If you ever do -- so early into this.)
Please note that you will need a skill number over 20! (All servers have skill ints 0-20, but some go up to 24. Mine went up to 23, so I used #23 as my summoning skill)

You can summon ANY NPCs you want. If you had an advanced 317 with custom NPCs, which ARE summon monsters, I suggest using them to give it the feel of it.

Basically, here&#39;s the MAIN setup of the coding:
[code]if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;########&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 0)
         {
   if(playerLevel[##] &lt; ##){
   sendMessage(&quot;You need at least level ## Summoning to summon this!&quot;);
   return;
}
   if(playerLevel[##] &gt; ##)
   addSkillXP(#####, ##);
   server.npcHandler.newSummonedNPC(####, absX, absY-1, heightLevel, absX-1, absY-1, absX+1, absY-1, 1, server.npcHandler.GetNpcListHP(##), false, playerId);
   summonedNPCS++;
   actionTimer = 20;
   sendMessage(&quot;You Summoned a ######!&quot;); 
   sendMessage(&quot;You now have &quot;+ playerLevel[##] +&quot; Summoning!&quot;);
}[/code]

Seems confusing, but let me explain this.
[code]if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;########&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 0)[/code]
THOSE ###&#39;s are the command name, as you would guess. Mine are currently &quot;summonNPCNAMEHERE&quot;.

[code]   if(playerLevel[##] &lt; ##){
   sendMessage(&quot;You need at least level ## Summoning to summon this!&quot;);
   return;
}[/code]
The FIRST ## here is the SKILL NUMBER YOU ARE GOING TO USE. Now, as I said, mine is 23, so, it should be 23 for me.
NOW, the SECOND ## here is the level REQUIREMENT you want it to be set at. 
If this is your first part of the coding, just remove this part, since you want people to start up at level 1, right? 
If not, change the second ## to the level requirement you want it to be (E.G. 15 is my second one).

[code]   if(playerLevel[##] &gt; ##)
   addSkillXP(#####, ##);[/code]

This part is almost self explanatory. The FIRST ## here should be the skill number you&#39;re using, again.
The &gt; ## means that, if they HAVE THAT LEVEL, OR HIGHER, THEY CAN SUMMON IT. That should be the exact same level requirement as the part above, for the coding.
Now, the ##### in the above is how much EXPERIENCE gets added to the ## in that line of code. The ## is the Skill Number, again.
If you want it to give 10000 Experience to the summoning skill, write [code]addSkillXP(10000, ##);[/code]
I can&#39;t fill in the second part because that&#39;s YOUR choice.

[code]   server.npcHandler.newSummonedNPC(####, absX, absY-1, heightLevel, absX-1, absY-1, absX+1, absY-1, 1, server.npcHandler.GetNpcListHP(##), false, playerId);
   summonedNPCS++;
   actionTimer = 20;[/code]
This is the Confusing part, alright?
It may not seem hard, but leave everything but the #### and the ## as is, or you may not have summons at all. :P
The #### in that, is the NPC ID you&#39;re going to be using. If you put [code]server.npcHandler.newSummonedNPC(50, absX, absY-1, heightLevel, absX-1, absY-1, absX+1, absY-1, 1, server.npcHandler.GetNpcListHP(##), false, playerId);
   summonedNPCS++;
   actionTimer = 20;[/code]
You&#39;re going to summon a KBD.
Now, the second ## of that simply means what HP it&#39;s going to get. Don&#39;t put the actual number because that doesn&#39;t work. You need to have an NPC in NPC.cfg written down, with a certain HP. Make it the NPC you&#39;re using above so it can properly recognize it. So, for KBD, if you have KBD written down in npc.cfg in the 27th line of the file, with 500 HP, replace the ## with 27. That makes it call the 27th line of coding&#39;s NPC Health. Seems confusing, but re-read it if you don&#39;t understand that. ^^&quot;

Back to the easy stuff:
[code]   sendMessage(&quot;You Summoned a ######!&quot;); 
   sendMessage(&quot;You now have &quot;+ playerLevel[##] +&quot; Summoning!&quot;);
}[/code]

Now, this is just sending messages.
The first ###### should be what your NPC Name is. So if it&#39;s KBD, put it as You Summoned a King Black Dragon! or something like that.
The SECOND ## of that is, again, the Skill Number you&#39;re using.
So, mine is 23, since it&#39;s all for my 23rd skill.

--THESE SKILLS WILL NOT APPEAR ON YOUR SKILL LIST. DON&#39;T ASK ME HOW TO PUT IT ON, CUZ IDK. ^^&quot;
You can change any of the above messages to your liking. :]

Step 3: PLACING the coding. (One of the most difficult, and easiest to mess up parts)

So, in client.java... Search for any commands you have.
Under the last } in the coding, add the Summoning command(s).
So, if you set it all up to your liking (E.G., many summons or whatever) it should look SOMETHING like this: (Mine -- DO NOT JUST COPY THIS AND CHANGE IT... AND ESPECIALLY NEVER TAKE CREDIT FOR IT)
Note that I have a lot of summons since I have a lot of levels ^^&quot; Low exp for an epic skill.
And yes, I have the custom summoning NPCs coded into my client. :]
[code]if(command.startsWith(&quot;suggest&quot;))  {
      sendMessage(&quot;Sending...&quot;);
	sendMessage(&quot;Suggestion Succesfully Sent To Epic! :D&quot;);
	BufferedWriter bw = null;
String suggestion = command.substring(8);
try {
         bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(&quot;suggestions.txt&quot;, true));
	bw.write(playerName+&quot;: &quot;+suggestion);
	bw.newLine();

      } catch (IOException ioe) {

      } finally {
	if (bw != null) try {

You may notice that I have &quot;summonstats&quot; at the bottom.
If you want that, feel free to copy it.
Just replace the playerLevel[23] with what skill number yours is. :]
(Oh, and a note for the new-to-coding-people. Don&#39;t try this unless you have made a backup! If you didn&#39;t chances are you didn&#39;t do it right unless you just copied what I have above. :P -- Please don&#39;t. Make an effort :\)
(BEFORE COMPILING. CHECK YOUR BRACKETS... Brackets = the cause of 100 errors)

That&#39;s really all there is to it!
And your finished product is...[/b]

[i]NOTE: I know my working pictures had glitched NPCs. It&#39;s a 317, so get over it... Not many of them have perfect NPC movement animation :\[/i]

I&#39;d give more credit if I could to Silent CJ and Nobiwa666 for helping me with the finishing touches on the code. :]
Anyways, comment on if you like it or not! ;D

Lol. Hope this helps SOME people... Took me long enough to figure out how to do it. :P</description>

I added it in just incase it was needed, so I’m not sure if it’s absolutely needed for THIS.</p>
<p>Step 2: Setting up the commands. (I suggest you start MAKING these codes in a text document so as not to mess up your client.java – If you ever do – so early into this.)<br>
Please note that you will need a skill number over 20! (All servers have skill ints 0-20, but some go up to 24. Mine went up to 23, so I used <span class="hashtag">#23</span> as my summoning skill)</p>
<p>You can summon ANY NPCs you want. If you had an advanced 317 with custom NPCs, which ARE summon monsters, I suggest using them to give it the feel of it.</p>
<p>Basically, here’s the MAIN setup of the coding:</p>
<p><code>if (command.equalsIgnoreCase("########") &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 0)
         {
   if(playerLevel[##] &lt; ##){
   sendMessage("You need at least level ## Summoning to summon this!");
   return;
}
   if(playerLevel[##] &gt; ##)
   addSkillXP(#####, ##);
   server.npcHandler.newSummonedNPC(####, absX, absY-1, heightLevel, absX-1, absY-1, absX+1, absY-1, 1, server.npcHandler.GetNpcListHP(##), false, playerId);
   summonedNPCS++;
   actionTimer = 20;
   sendMessage("You Summoned a ######!"); 
   sendMessage("You now have "+ playerLevel[##] +" Summoning!");
}</code></p>
<p>Seems confusing, but let me explain this.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (command.equalsIgnoreCase("########") &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 0)</code></pre>
<p>THOSE ###'s are the command name, as you would guess. Mine are currently “summonNPCNAMEHERE”.</p>
<p><code>   if(playerLevel[##] &lt; ##){
   sendMessage("You need at least level ## Summoning to summon this!");
   return;
}</code><br>
The FIRST ## here is the SKILL NUMBER YOU ARE GOING TO USE. Now, as I said, mine is 23, so, it should be 23 for me.<br>
NOW, the SECOND ## here is the level REQUIREMENT you want it to be set at.<br>
If this is your first part of the coding, just remove this part, since you want people to start up at level 1, right?<br>
If not, change the second ## to the level requirement you want it to be (E.G. 15 is my second one).</p>
<p><code>   if(playerLevel[##] &gt; ##)
   addSkillXP(#####, ##);</code></p>
<p>This part is almost self explanatory. The FIRST ## here should be the skill number you’re using, again.<br>
The &gt; ## means that, if they HAVE THAT LEVEL, OR HIGHER, THEY CAN SUMMON IT. That should be the exact same level requirement as the part above, for the coding.<br>
Now, the ##### in the above is how much EXPERIENCE gets added to the ## in that line of code. The ## is the Skill Number, again.<br>
If you want it to give 10000 Experience to the summoning skill, write <code>addSkillXP(10000, ##);</code><br>
I can’t fill in the second part because that’s YOUR choice.</p>
<p><code>   server.npcHandler.newSummonedNPC(####, absX, absY-1, heightLevel, absX-1, absY-1, absX+1, absY-1, 1, server.npcHandler.GetNpcListHP(##), false, playerId);
   summonedNPCS++;
   actionTimer = 20;</code><br>
This is the Confusing part, alright?<br>
It may not seem hard, but leave everything but the #### and the ## as is, or you may not have summons at all. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
The #### in that, is the NPC ID you’re going to be using. If you put <code>server.npcHandler.newSummonedNPC(50, absX, absY-1, heightLevel, absX-1, absY-1, absX+1, absY-1, 1, server.npcHandler.GetNpcListHP(##), false, playerId);
   summonedNPCS++;
   actionTimer = 20;</code><br>
You’re going to summon a KBD.<br>
Now, the second ## of that simply means what HP it’s going to get. Don’t put the actual number because that doesn’t work. You need to have an NPC in NPC.cfg written down, with a certain HP. Make it the NPC you’re using above so it can properly recognize it. So, for KBD, if you have KBD written down in npc.cfg in the 27th line of the file, with 500 HP, replace the ## with 27. That makes it call the 27th line of coding’s NPC Health. Seems confusing, but re-read it if you don’t understand that. ^^"</p>
<p>Back to the easy stuff:</p>
<p><code>   sendMessage("You Summoned a ######!"); 
   sendMessage("You now have "+ playerLevel[##] +" Summoning!");
}</code></p>
<p>Now, this is just sending messages.<br>
The first ###### should be what your NPC Name is. So if it’s KBD, put it as You Summoned a King Black Dragon! or something like that.<br>
The SECOND ## of that is, again, the Skill Number you’re using.<br>
So, mine is 23, since it’s all for my 23rd skill.</p>
<p>–THESE SKILLS WILL NOT APPEAR ON YOUR SKILL LIST. DON’T ASK ME HOW TO PUT IT ON, CUZ IDK. ^^"<br>
You can change any of the above messages to your liking. :]</p>
<p>Step 3: PLACING the coding. (One of the most difficult, and easiest to mess up parts)</p>
<p>So, in client.java… Search for any commands you have.<br>
Under the last } in the coding, add the Summoning command(s).<br>
So, if you set it all up to your liking (E.G., many summons or whatever) it should look SOMETHING like this: (Mine – DO NOT JUST COPY THIS AND CHANGE IT… AND ESPECIALLY NEVER TAKE CREDIT FOR IT)<br>
Note that I have a lot of summons since I have a lot of levels ^^" Low exp for an epic skill.<br>
And yes, I have the custom summoning NPCs coded into my client. :]</p>

<p>You may notice that I have “summonstats” at the bottom.<br>
If you want that, feel free to copy it.<br>
Just replace the playerLevel[23] with what skill number yours is. :]<br>
(Oh, and a note for the new-to-coding-people. Don’t try this unless you have made a backup! If you didn’t chances are you didn’t do it right unless you just copied what I have above. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> – Please don’t.
