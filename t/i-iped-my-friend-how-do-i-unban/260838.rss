    <description>i have iped my friend testing.. i have done ::ipban (name)... then when it did it afterwards i did ::unban (name).. and he wasnt un-ip banned.  if you know if there are any commands to unban him could you tell me.. also i would like to ad this from his player info folder and ask if any of this means anything with the bans:


[CHARACTER]
character-height = 0
character-posx = 2098
character-posy = 4426
character-rights = 0
character-ismember = 0
character-messages = 0
character-lastconnection = 222-155-167-162.jetstream.xtra.co.nz
character-lastlogin = 20090107
character-energy = 100
character-gametime = 0
character-gamecount = 3663
