    <description>Hey guys,

I&#39;m very interested in RSPS and coding and hosting. 
I had my own server for many years but my father changed work so all the computers were changed to macbooks, now my question is.

Is there anyone who can help me setting up all things to host my own server and get back in to the world of RSPS asap?

It would be amazing if someone could help me with this!
Hope to see many reactions!


Greetz,
