    <description>[b][size=16pt]Welcome to my thread about StoneLand.[/size][/b]

[b]LINK TO ALL JARS:[/b] [url=https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B3vJyY3tdKZSSUlrSkdBRlkxVmc&amp;usp=sharing]https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B3vJyY3tdKZSSUlrSkdBRlkxVmc&amp;usp=sharing[/url]

&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]Currently Working On:[/b]  CLEANING UP AND OPTIMIZING CODE
[b]Next Planned Update: [/b]  Clickable inventory items&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[b]A Little Bit About Me.[/b]
I am currently a sophomore in a university majoring in computer engineering and minoring in computer science and mathematics.  
I have been coding for around 5 years now with knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java and C.

[b]What is StoneLand?[/b]
StoneLand is a 2 dimensional single-player role-playing game.  (Written in Java).
You will be able to customize your player, level them up, fight monsters, explore, quest, and much more! 
Eventually I have plans to make this multi-player, however, I would like to add all of the features of the game (IE: basic skills) before a multiplayer variant is released to the public.
*StoneLand is not open-sourced, however that may change at any given time.

[b]When Can I Start Playing Single Player?[/b]
Users will be able to download the game once I release the first beta version.  The first version will be very basic (probably just allow a user to move).
Every single update that I commit to this game will be available though through the link at the top of this post.

[b]Is There a Website?[/b]
Currently, no, there is not a website.  However I am currently working on a rough sketch of a website which will be used for download links, update news, etc.
All the information on the website however will be on the Moparscape forums as well.  So if you&#39;d like to stay up-to-date all you have to do is stay on this thread.

[b]What has been done:[/b]
[code]
[01 February 2016] Added a Dummy Skills Tab, to test out how easy it is to add interfaces. [VERSION 16]
[31 January 2016] Finished the Inventory, there is a wooden sword in the bag [VERSION 15]

<p>How were you testing it?[/quote]</p>
<p>After x amount of seconds it would stop the player and display the amount of pixels moved, and they were both exactly the same pixels moved in the exact amount of time</p>
<p>That was done with a computer so there wouldn’t be any human error</p>
<p>EDIT: if you’re talking about the walking on water mishap, that was because a player bounds (when walking west) was slightly off, which then processed you walking on grass when you walked down, until you reached a null tile.  Was a super easy fix and easy to find.</p>
<p>On a side note: I know I’ve been wanting to start with the InterfaceHandler but I’ve been tied up in a lot of homework.  Will start working on it tomorrow however.</p>

              <p>Thanks guys, keeping the momentum. Currently working on NPC’s and their movement. Then I plan on working on an Interface class, which will be used for inventory, among other things.  Also after that I will read through my code and see if there is anything that I can clean up or make faster. (Although I’ve taken much care in the current code).</p>
<p>Just an update <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>By the way, the goal for everything to be done is middle of June, because I will be busy with my studies. So I’m sure updates will slow down but they will not stop!!</p>

<blockquote>[b]Currently Working On:[/b]  CLEANING UP AND OPTIMIZING CODE
[b]Next Planned Update: [/b]  Clickable inventory items</blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">A Little Bit About Me.</span><br>
I am currently a sophomore in a university majoring in computer engineering and minoring in computer science and mathematics.<br>
I have been coding for around 5 years now with knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java and C.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What is StoneLand?</span><br>
StoneLand is a 2 dimensional single-player role-playing game.  (Written in Java).<br>
You will be able to customize your player, level them up, fight monsters, explore, quest, and much more!<br>
Eventually I have plans to make this multi-player, however, I would like to add all of the features of the game (IE: basic skills) before a multiplayer variant is released to the public.<br>
*StoneLand is not open-sourced, however that may change at any given time.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">When Can I Start Playing Single Player?</span><br>
Users will be able to download the game once I release the first beta version.  The first version will be very basic (probably just allow a user to move).<br>
Every single update that I commit to this game will be available though through the link at the top of this post.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Is There a Website?</span><br>
Currently, no, there is not a website.  However I am currently working on a rough sketch of a website which will be used for download links, update news, etc.<br>
All the information on the website however will be on the Moparscape forums as well.  So if you’d like to stay up-to-date all you have to do is stay on this thread.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What has been done:</span></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">[01 February 2016] Added a Dummy Skills Tab, to test out how easy it is to add interfaces. [VERSION 16]
[31 January 2016] Finished the Inventory, there is a wooden sword in the bag [VERSION 15]
[31 January 2016] Created a Dummy Inventory; It's just a test you can't even exit out of the interface just yet. Just to show that it works.
[31 January 2016] Added InterfaceHandler
[30 January 2016] Added an "Updates per second (UPS)" tracker to the top right screen. [VERSION 13]
[30 January 2016] Fixed a walking glitch thanks to Zoso_
[28 January 2016] Finished NPC's, Version 10+ shows the Goblins that will not leave a 3x3 area; they are clipped too.
[28 January 2016] Fixed a clipping bug (NPC would get stuck on certain tiles).
[28 January 2016] NPC's now move around automatically! (Still want to add a bounds). VERSION 0009 if you'd like to see it in action.
[28 January 2016] NPC's are clipped when moving. (Moving around is still buggy).
[28 January 2016] NPC support!
[28 January 2016] Finished Player / Object collisions.
[28 January 2016] Started to work on Player / Object collisions (Walk under trees, but not the stump etc.)
[28 January 2016] Added Trees to the World. (Regular and Maple)
