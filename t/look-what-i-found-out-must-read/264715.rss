    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/look-what-i-found-out-must-read/264715</link>
    <description>Long time,  :)

But umm..I found this tight website http://swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&amp;rb=369734. [glow=red,2,300](You get 3 points for registering with my link)[/glow]

And you can earn points easily and in different ways, not only by surveys but even just use their search engine.. lol its pretty tight.

And theres some other ways to get points and there is ALOT of prizes! Compared to other websites that only have like xbox and ipods haha. 

But yeah.. PLEASE register with my referral  &gt;:( So i can get a little more points and I&#39;d be happy to register to any websites that you give me in exchange. Oh and some promo codes are: SWAG1, SWAGGERNAUT, HappySwagDay, BirthdayBuck, 19000000. [glow=red,2,300]BUT THEY ALL EXPIRE IN A LIMITED TIME, SO GET THEM WHILE YOU CAN!![/glow]

To enter them, (after you have registered on my referral go to: &quot;My Account&quot; or The little number that shows you how much points you have. Then On the bottom left side there is a Code thing to enter codes in haha. Thats all! Thank you!</description>
