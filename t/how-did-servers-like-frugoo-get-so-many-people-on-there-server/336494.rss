<p>Frugoo had a good player base, because it had good stability, good pking (everyone had the same bonuses, items didn’t matter stats did, pking anywhere (dueling)), good skills, advertising, good staff (no noobs who were abusing the system). It was just a fun server to play. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
