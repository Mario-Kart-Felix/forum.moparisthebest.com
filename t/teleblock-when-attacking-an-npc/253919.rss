    <title>Teleblock when attacking an npc?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/teleblock-when-attacking-an-npc/253919</link>
    <description>Alright so I&#39;m almost done making my rare area.
Now i want to make it that so when the player attacks said rare dropping npc
that they are teleblocked until they kill the creature or they die.

I&#39;ve tried fooling around with it, but I&#39;m not exactly sure what i should do
Could someone give me a helpful nudge?</description>
