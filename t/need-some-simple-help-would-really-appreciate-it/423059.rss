    <description>Hello, I am having a really simple problem I think most of the people on this server may know the answer to.
Okay so the problem i am having is that,
I have the server coded, all set up basically, (the source,client,and cache)
And i have been wondering is there a need for a &quot;Server&quot; file/folder
because the [u]RSPS[/u] I downloaded did not come with one.
And the second question i have for you guys today Is, 
How do I get my server online basically.
I have tried hamachi but every tutorial/video i watch they always stop when there done opening hamachi
So if anyone knows how to get a server online please contact me.
