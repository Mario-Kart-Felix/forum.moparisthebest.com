    <title>Less laggy RSPS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/less-laggy-rsps/385463</link>
    <description>Hi my server is Project Insanity.
It lags a lot and I have been forced to put the auto restarter on 10 minutes because every like 12 minutes it lags and everybody logs out except in the cmd, the server itself just like freezes and lags you out but the cmd thinks everybody is still logged in...
Can somebody help me figure out why its doing this? I will use RuneSource but I need to know a little more about Java before moving onto that... Just adapted from Allstar to PI in September.</description>

<p>I will… I just need to know how I can quick-fix this, if that’s possible…<br>
I have a 2GB windows OS bought in 08 - Vista… not a laggy computer at all…</p>
