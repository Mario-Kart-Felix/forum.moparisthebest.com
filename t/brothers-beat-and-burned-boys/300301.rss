    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;TWO savage brothers who tortured boys of 11 and nine snarled at their blood-soaked victims: &quot;We can&#39;t leave you - you are not dead yet.&quot;


The &quot;devil&quot; brothers, aged just ten and 11, made the chilling threat during an unbelievable attack in which they:

BATTERED the terrified boys with sticks and bricks.

FORCED them to sexually abuse each other.

KEPT them captive with barbed wire strung between trees.

URINATED on them while drinking cans of lager.

STUFFED socks in their mouths to prevent them crying for help.

BURNED the eyelids and ears of the nine-year-old with cigarettes.

STAMPED on his genitals and face.

MADE him eat nettles.

RAMMED a sharp stick into his arm, then plunged a burning ciagrette into his wound.

WOUND a noose around the neck of the 11-year-old.

TRAMPLED on his head so fiercely he was blinded.

THREW rocks on him, and DROPPED a broken earthenware sink on his head.

The 11-year-old begged the brothers: &quot;Leave me, I can&#39;t see. Please leave me to die.&quot;

The evil pair - who appeared in court to plead to charges yesterday - did just that, dumping him naked from the waist down on the edge of a stream at the foot of a ravine.

The nine-year-old was ordered to go away and told: &quot;Kill yourself.&quot;

The frightened lad pretended to ram a stick down his throat to give the impression he was harming himself - but then managed to slip away.

He was found wandering, dazed and covered in blood, in the former pit village of Edlington, near Doncaster, South Yorks. He told shocked villagers: &quot;I don&#39;t know where my friend is.&quot;

A sign outside the home where the two kids who beat up boys from Edlington Doncaster reads &#39;Beware of the kids&#39;

Warning ... the sign outside the boys&#39; home

The terribly injured 11-year-old - the uncle of the younger victim - was found 90 minutes later. He was airlifted to a hospital&#39;s intensive care unit.

He battled back from the brink. But the families of both victims fear they will be mentally scarred for life.

The feral brothers had been placed with elderly foster parents because their cannabis-smoking mother, who had been left by her violently drunk partner, could not cope with them.

The foster parents, in their 60s, could not control them either. A week before their horrific attack, they carried out a &quot;rehearsal&quot; by battering an 11-year-old choirboy by a stream, telling him: &quot;Do you want to die?&quot;

The petrified choirboy, who was punched, kicked and told his head would be smashed by a brick, was saved when a passing angler intervened and told him to run for his life.
Expulsions

The brothers also have a history of terrorising neighbours and expulsions from schools.
...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>No. But if I was to liken the behaviour of these boys to a movie that I had seen then I’d liken it to hostel 1/2.<br>
They’re pretty much 10 year old sadists that clean up (kill the victim) after their ‘fun’ . And that’s horrific to think about.</p>

It’s not just the UK or Austria; everywhere has weirdos. The problem is that if they get caught once then they only become more careful the next time; others skip this step and lead a very clandestine life from the word go (Fritzl being such a case, with his actions being so secret that the girl’s imprisonment lasted for years).[/quote]<br>

It’s not just the UK or Austria; everywhere has weirdos. The problem is that if they get caught once then they only become more careful the next time; others skip this step and lead a very clandestine life from the word go (Fritzl being such a case, with his actions being so secret that the girl’s imprisonment lasted for years).</p>

              <p>This is almost as bad as what I heard happened in like 1992 or so…</p>
<p>These two kid’s pulled a “prank” on this ‘nerd’ from their middle school, and the cut piece’s of skin off his arms and made him eat them, and then they cut the muscle from his calves, fried it and made him eat it… In the end the kid had suffered the worst beating ever. When the kid’s were in court their excuse was “It was a prank at first, until he started trying to stab us, we then started cutting him and making him eat his own flesh just for what he tried to do.”</p>
<p>The kid’s were 13 and 12 at the time, the boy that was tortured was only 11 or 12, when the judge seen the proof, and how the kid’s leg was amputated he immediately said they were guilty and sentenced to a Juvenile detention center until 18, and will be tried again when out for future sentences.</p>
<p>I will find the source for it soon, I think it’s still on file for the news station.</p>
