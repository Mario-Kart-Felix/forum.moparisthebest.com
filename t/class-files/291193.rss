    <description>I decided to get back in my server, but i reinstalled my OS and all of my client files got erased.

I checked my hosting, and it turns out I still have my client .rar file, but with all the .class files, no .java.

I have a very old version of my client on my other computer.

Ive searched google for a .class to .java converter, and put in all the imports it was missing from the other files.

When I was done I compiled and got a shit load of errors.

Can anyone help?</description>
