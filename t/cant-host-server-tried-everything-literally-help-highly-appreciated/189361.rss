    <title>Can&#39;t Host Server. Tried Everything (literally?) Help highly appreciated</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-host-server-tried-everything-literally-help-highly-appreciated/189361</link>
    <description>So heres the deal guys. I have tried EVERYTHING to host a server. I know most people can create a no-ip, get the server they want, compile it, run it, and its all working nice. Thats not the deal with me, i have wanted to host for a very long time but haven&#39;t been able to because of a major problem. My router. My router has prevented me from hosting for the longest time. Help would be highly appreciated if you could help me out with hosting with a router.
Router: Linksys 

I have tried creating static ip&#39;s, forwarding ports, all sorts of stuff. If anyone knows the straightforward solution or something thats not along those lines that could allow me to finally host a server many thanks would be given. 

EDITING: STEPS I HAVE DONE TO HELP EVERYONE KNOW.

1) created a No-Ip.
2)Read a Tutorial on how to create a static IP.
3) Created a static IP (control panel, connections, local area, changed from automatically obtain to static)
4) STATIC IP WAS SUCCESSFUL (internet still worked)
5) Logged into my router.
6)Clicked gaming tab or w\e.
7) Named application Mopar... opened ports ranging from 5555-43954 , checked the &quot;on&quot; so its on.
8) Tried it out, had a few friends try to get on through my no-ip and regular ip.
9) to no prevail, they couldn&#39;t login and I&#39;m here now typing this.</description>

              <p>I saw your problem on hosting a server, all you have to do is on your linksys router, click applications and gaming, for port range put your server port in both of them, then for the protocal put it on both, then for the empty spot at the end of the thing, put that last 1,2 or 3 digits in your ip, go to start &gt; run &gt; type cmd then type ipconfig, and its the “ip address”, then create a no-ip and download the no-ip DUCT and click on your ip so its a smiley face, then run your server and wala!</p>

              <p>First you need to make a static ip.<br>
(<a href="http://www.portforward.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.portforward.com</a>) has the tutorial. (choose your router)</p>
<p>Then, you need to follow portforwards guide to portforwarding.<br>
Once you have done both of those, go Start&gt; Control panel&gt; security center. Add your port to the list of accepted ports. Turn off your firewall.<br>
Turn off any other firewalls from anti virus protection.</p>
<p>That worked for me.</p>

downloaded jdk6u2 did path specified thing<br>
downloaded source<br>
opened port 43594 through firewall and checked TCP<br>
Turned firewall off<br>
Made static ip then everything you did on your default gateway on address bar<br>
On application and gaming, for ip address I put my static ip<br>
downloaded no-ip and I have checked the ip I want to use with the smiley blushed<br>
Using laptop<br>
Checked on start&gt;run&gt;cmd&gt;ipconfig/all to see if I had 2 DNS servers( 1 = you can’t portforward )</p>
<p>If that doesn’t work, just forget about the laptop and unplug everything to your router ( tell your parents before that because you may screw up your computer). Do everything you did on the laptop but without the router. It would lag more though</p>
