    <title>Adding Dice to My server 317 [PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-dice-to-my-server-317-pi/518841</link>
    <description>I want to add the Dice Bag to my server but everytime i try, it gives me a compiling error and ends up not working. I&#39;m not going to type out the error because i know what it&#39;s saying kind of. It has a problem with the code I put into clickitem.java and as soon as i delete the code from clickitem.java everythings back to normal but i still dont have a dice bag. At first I was trying to add the dicebag itself into my game. But then i tried adding the roll option on a item of my choice. neither worked. Comment if you can help please.</description>
