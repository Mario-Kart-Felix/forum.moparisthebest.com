    <description>Hers problem...


i found out how to do affects with cbow so it shows the arrows with glow around it here it is...

[code]if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 4214 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 859 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 861) //bows
{
staticAnimation(250, absX, absY, 100);	//Crystal bow with arrows
return 426;
}[/code]

What i want to know is if someone knows the staticanimation to normal arrows so i can add in as magic bow and regular bows with regular arrows.

and do you see the part were it shows the &quot;100&quot; thats the location it points to, 100 is north could someone help me figureout which way it would be for north or however you bow is facing =\ &lt;---- this one is a little confusing because the bow switchs places every time you att, so i need one that is constant.</description>
