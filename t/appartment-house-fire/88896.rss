happened when i was in school, the same town and could see smoke from my school.

&lt;blockquote&gt;MONTELLO — Firefighters from four communities battled a blaze Wednesday in downtown Montello that closed off a major intersection for most of the afternoon and damaged a structure containing a business and apartment.

The fire started when as many as four men in a garage attached to an apartment and the Dragon Forged welding company on state Highway 22 were attempting to service a van around 1 p.m., police said. The men reportedly poured gasoline into the van&#39;s carburetor before it spurted out and burned one of them.

The men attempted to rush the victim for treatment while a fire started in the van and eventually spread to the rest of the building, Montello Police Chief Rick Olson said.

A resident of the apartment, identified by police as Kyle Kreuger, suffered major burns to his chest from the gasoline. He was taken to Crossroads Clinic in Oxford before being flown by helicopter to University of Wisconsin Hospital for serious burns, Olson said.

Fire crews concentrated water on the building for more than five hours while flames shot up from its interior. The building, which some pegged as possibly 100 years old, has had more than one addition and flames spread into various walls and crevices, hampering firefighting efforts, Olson said.

&quot;It&#39;s such an old building that once it gets inside, you have a hard time containing it,&quot; he added.

It was unclear if the men knew the fire had started while they were rescuing their friend, Olson said. The group called in Kreuger&#39;s injuries but did not call in the fire, according to Olson.

&quot;There was an explosion,&quot; he said. &quot;We don&#39;t know the exact details after that.&quot;

Officials closed off Highway 22 where it meets Highway 23 in downtown Montello almost immediately after the fire was seen coming out of the building. The highway most likely would be closed off until sometime today, and the extent of the building&#39;s damage may require it to be razed before the road is opened, Olson said.

&quot;I&#39;m not comfortable with the building there,&quot; he added.

Residents lined the street watching the smoke pour out over a nearby used car dealership as well as many other of the businesses lining the district.

&quot;It flared right up,&quot; said Will Zellmer, who lives on the east side of Montello. &quot;It&#39;s a lot of smoke. The flames were shooting up.&quot;

Fire crews from Montello, Markesan, Princeton and Oxford aided in the firefighting effort.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>A resident of the apartment, identified by police as Kyle Kreuger, suffered major burns to his chest from the gasoline. He was taken to Crossroads Clinic in Oxford before being flown by helicopter to University of Wisconsin Hospital for serious burns, Olson said.</p>
<p>Fire crews concentrated water on the building for more than five hours while flames shot up from its interior. The building, which some pegged as possibly 100 years old, has had more than one addition and flames spread into various walls and crevices, hampering firefighting efforts, Olson said.</p>
<p>“It’s such an old building that once it gets inside, you have a hard time containing it,” he added.</p>
<p>It was unclear if the men knew the fire had started while they were rescuing their friend, Olson said. The group called in Kreuger’s injuries but did not call in the fire, according to Olson.</p>
<p>“There was an explosion,” he said. “We don’t know the exact details after that.”</p>
<p>Officials closed off Highway 22 where it meets Highway 23 in downtown Montello almost immediately after the fire was seen coming out of the building. The highway most likely would be closed off until sometime today, and the extent of the building’s damage may require it to be razed before the road is opened, Olson said.</p>
<p>“I’m not comfortable with the building there,” he added.</p>
<p>Residents lined the street watching the smoke pour out over a nearby used car dealership as well as many other of the businesses lining the district.</p>
<p>“It flared right up,” said Will Zellmer, who lives on the east side of Montello. “It’s a lot of smoke. The flames were shooting up.”</p>
<p>Fire crews from Montello, Markesan, Princeton and Oxford aided in the firefighting effort.</p>
