    <title>Tree Reviews ParagonX - With Developer [HD] - #5 From GoodScape/BadScape Series</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tree-reviews-paragonx-with-developer-hd-5-from-goodscape-badscape-series/550861</link>
    <description>[i]Note: The review mainly revolves around the concepts presented and the potential that&#39;s there. The technical side has [b]not[/b] been examined.
Good isn&#39;t great but it&#39;s still a thousand steps ahead of bad.[/i] 

This week I thought I would get a developer on Skype for a new private server in private testing.
 It looks promising enough. It&#39;s rough around the edges but improvements are being made. 
Some content I cut out as requested. Few awkward moments but that&#39;s any Skype call.

There is an accompanying app on android that ties in with the game:

Enjoy.</description>

<p>Well fingers crossed they get that fixed. I agree. Hopefully they take it on board.<br>
Like I said, I haven’t looked into the technical side of this one.<br>
I’m trying not to dissuade people from working on new ideas which I was worried my past videos were doing.</p>

              <blockquote>I think one thing that turned me off from deeming this 'good' and not 'okay' was the lack of polish, even in testing. But that is just my opinion. Especially with the fact that it has teleports, like directly to areas, embedded into menus. That idea seems really off putting and is an idea used for a long time because of the lack of support of other critical development features that a server must possess to take it to the next level.</blockquote>
<p>Admittedly, the review was mostly on the concept as a whole and the direction they’re heading. So yes, I’ll say what I seen was good but not terribly great.<br>
However, that’s many steps ahead of what others seem to provide.<br>
I think if they stick to their word and continue development the way it has been going, they will have a fairly decent end result.<br>
As for the rest, I won’t touch the technical side or the polish because it would be unfair since it was a private testing. If it was public testing, then I probably would.</p>
<blockquote>Runescape is meant to embody a world adventure feeling. Adventuring around a town and not utilizing the awesome map you have to work with is disheartening and makes a RSPS feel empty. In my opinion of course however approaching how to fill a map up properly is a challenge since I'm going to fathom these guys don't have the technology to be able to easily add in content to various parts of the map in a short manner of time.</blockquote>
<p>That’s why I almost wish we scrapped skills and created a new map from ground up. The whole idea of skilling just doesn’t fit anymore. This server has made a nice start by creating a lot of custom methods of crafting but I do believe more can be done.</p>
<blockquote>When are you going to review the official server or should I get in contact with you about that? :P
<p>PSA: I have high standards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a great idea. Feel free to do it with me over Skype if you’re up for it.<br>
I’d like to do one on Soulsplit as well sometime.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-i">- I look for a decent hub that doesn’t force the population to be spread out unless there’s a larger memberbase. With this one, all skills can be leveled from within the town.</span></p>
<p>As well as that, I look for signs that developers care a lot about their creations and that they will be around long enough for it to be worth investing time into it.<br>
There are more items of the criteria list but they’re the main ones. The intention of this video is to encourage a developer branching out and trying something new. Even if it’s a failed attempt, it’s one step towards something different.<br>
This one is a good start, even if not completed. But like I said, it’s private testing at the moment and development is based off player suggestions.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I think one thing that turned me off from deeming this ‘good’ and not ‘okay’ was the lack of polish, even in testing. But that is just my opinion. Especially with the fact that it has teleports, like directly to areas, embedded into menus. That idea seems really off putting and is an idea used for a long time because of the lack of support of other critical development features that a server must possess to take it to the next level.</p>
<p>I bolded what I thought we would agree upon.</p>
<p>I italicized what I disagree with. Runescape is meant to embody a world adventure feeling. Adventuring around a town and not utilizing the awesome map you have to work with is disheartening and makes a RSPS feel empty. In my opinion of course however approaching how to fill a map up properly is a challenge since I’m going to fathom these guys don’t have the technology to be able to easily add in content to various parts of the map in a short manner of time.</p>
<p>Also lord that client looked ugly, but that’s mostly because of the distortion that a full screen 317 client provides. I wish people would replace the software renderer with opengl however as far as I remember the understanding of how textures work in clients like that is not completely understood but I have heard the phrase used before. Someone please remind me.</p>
<p>When are you going to review the official server or should I get in contact with you about that? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>PSA: I have high standards.[/quote]</p>
<p>To address your point about the exploring the world, the PvE quest line is mainly exploring while the PvP line is more centralized. When the dialogue get’s added it will be more clear when the decision is made.</p>
<p>Also, you can play the game in regular mode or full screen mode, as expected.</p>
<p>I appreciate your feedback and I’ll make a note of it.</p>
