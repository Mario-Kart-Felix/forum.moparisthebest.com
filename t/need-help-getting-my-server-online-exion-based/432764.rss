    <title>Need help getting my server online [Exion based]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-getting-my-server-online-exion-based/432764</link>
    <description>i downloaded a client and server based on Exion [PI]
but i can&#39;t get my server online, i portforwarded correctly
(all server status checkers and port checkers say i did)
when i put my IP on a status checker is says: ONLINE
but no-one can login except me, also the moparscape webclient won&#39;t let people join my server
the IP of my server = 77.165.89.36               Port = 43594
i also set-up No-Ip but nothing seems to work
please can someone help? 
I REALLY DON&#39;T WANT TO USE HAMACHI!

EDIT: i did change the IP in the server to: 77.165.89.36 (maybe i did it wrong?)</description>
