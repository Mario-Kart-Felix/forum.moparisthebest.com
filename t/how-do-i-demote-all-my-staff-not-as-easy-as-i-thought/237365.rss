    <title>How do I demote all my staff? Not as easy as I thought</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-demote-all-my-staff-not-as-easy-as-i-thought/237365</link>
    <description>Hi. I seem to have at least 20 staff. Realistically... This is too much to demote by hand. Is there a way I can just demote everyone in the Character files? I&#39;m using Vista and I tried to search for character rights = 3 (something along that) either way, I searched word for word as it is in the file of and admin and nothing seemed to pop up. Help.

              <p>Go to character files, open there file, and at the top you should see player rights = (0, 1, 2, 3)<br>
3= creator<br>
2= admin<br>
1= mod<br>
0= normal player</p>
<p>Just edit them all that way.</p>
