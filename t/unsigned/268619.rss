    <description>Every time I try to load a signed java applet, it says:
The code cannot be verified by a trusted source.
Code will be treated as unsigned.
Name: (Insert applet name here)
java.ioEOFFEXCEPTION
It says this on every single signed applet I try to run.
How do I fix this?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 21, 2009, 07:17:53 pm[/size][hr]I guess everyone hates me =(</description>
