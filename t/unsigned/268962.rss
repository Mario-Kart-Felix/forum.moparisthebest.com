    <description>Every time I try to load a signed java applet, it says:

The code cannot be verified by a trusted source.
Code will be treated as unsigned.
Name: (Insert applet name here)
java.ioEOFFEXCEPTION

It says this on every single signed applet I try to run.
How do I fix this?</description>
