    <description>[b]Difficulty: N/A[/b]

This thread will be all about starting and maintaining your own client. It&#39;ll offer tips, tricks, and waffles. :)


[b]Chapter 1: Getting a client base[/b]

I suggest you use a 317 deob client to start off with. If you&#39;re new, you probably think that a great client has items like, Purple Dharoks, Colored Whips, etc... But that is the least bit true! Good clients almost always are based off of this 317 deob, and IMO, it&#39;s great. It might not be 100% noob-friendly, but it&#39;s the best choice because you&#39;ll learn more and therefore can build off this. If you took Bluurrs client to start off with, that would not be a great idea. Why? The code is MESSY, unorganized, and there&#39;s lots of un-needed code. I&#39;m not saying Bluurrs is a horrible client to work with, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend it, especially if you&#39;re new to clients. You can find the 317 deob on another website I will not mention that starts with Rune, or I believe you can get it on www.moparisthebest.com.

[b]Chapter 2: Humble Beginnings[/b]

So, you have your client! But this is far from what you&#39;re going to need or want. Right now it&#39;s just a blank 317 deob client, BORING. Now you will pretty much need to upgrade to the 377 cache. If you don&#39;t you&#39;ll be missing lots of key items like metal gloves and mostly everything from 7000+. (The ID&#39;s I have, like 7000+ are probably way off, but it doesn&#39;t matter...) It&#39;s hard to find a 377 cache, so I&#39;m not going to tell you to search for it like I did with the client. Download: http://uppit.com/v/64M83ZXJ Now delete your old cache and replace it with this one. Make sure it&#39;s named &quot;cache&quot;. 

So, open Class14.java
Find

[code]
if(i1 &lt; 0 || i1 &gt; anInt312)
return null;
[/code]
Replace that with
[code]
//if(i1 &lt; 0 || i1 &gt; anInt312)
//return null;
[/code]

Now you have a 377 cache! Make sure to post any errors if you get any. Run your client to see if it works.



[b]Chapter 3: Try some[/b]

You&#39;ve got a basic 317 client loading a 377 cache. What now? You may ask. Well, do some tutorials. When you do them, make sure you don&#39;t just C&amp;P and not look at the code. Study the code carefully, figure out what that part does, etc... This will benefit you more than you think it will. Some MUST-DO tutorials are; SWATS extending emote list and adding new emote system tutorial, fixing noclip tutorials, and avoiding cheat client tutorials

[b]Chapter 4: Cheaters [/b]

Cheaters. Cheaters are bad, they will try to ruin your server at any costs. Usually, they use cheat clients. (client-wise) Cheat clients are designed to act like real servers. They have ::money commands, ::lag or ::crash commands. (Not always, but that&#39;s what the average one has) If you didn&#39;t before, do some &quot;Avoiding Cheat Clients&quot; tutorials. A simple fix to this is to either jar your client, make it so that you can only connect with your client, or both.


[b]More chapters will be added as more questions are asked![/b]</description>

<p>No, 377’s are not even when hunter skill came into play, its when farming was still being invented. As for the code, that disables the cache size checking, without that you wont be able to get the client to load 377 cache without other mods.</p>
