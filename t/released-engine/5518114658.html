<p>I don’t see a problem with that when it comes to learning, in fact I think it’s one of the best ways to learn. I just also don’t think it shows the ‘amazing skill growth’ some people are posting about. I looked at the 3DICA and read some of the portions of the github, and the portions that aren’t in tutorials still have some pretty bad design. So it’s still going to take some effort to take this new knowledge you’re gaining and learn to apply it well.[/quote]<br>
What portions on github? And yes I am aware that my design skills are atrocious. I’m writing an animation system that utilizes decent design at the moment. I would rewrite my game but it’s just too much to rewrite.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/pure.html">@Pure</a>, yeah so it basically keeps floating point calculations consistent between platforms.</p>

        <pre><code class="lang-auto">JOGE:

Limits: Hey man I saw ur JOGE engine and I was wondering if I could use it in my project. Also how do I go about using one of these, as I've never used a game engine before. Do I need to read and understand all the methods in the JOGE source files?
object: Hello there! Sure you can. :) It doesn't have a lot of documentation, but I guess that's one way you can learn about it. On the other hand, the source code for the Ludum Dare game I made with JOGE, is also open source. It hasn't been uploaded to GitHub just yet. But you can find it on my project page, on the following link: http://martus.se/ld29/surface_invaders/. There should be a link to a ZIP file with the source code.
Limits: Thanks! And I'm mostly going to use JOGE to help me understand how a 3D engine works and hopefully I can eventually make my own. There aren't many good examples like yours, thanks again!
Limits: Do you know how I can get started on writing my own real 3D game engine like yours?
object: Yes, I do. Do like me, buy the book Developing Games in Java by David Brackeen. You can find his site at http://www.brackeen.com/javagamebook/. My game engine is inspired by his work, to some extent. I even use modified code from his examples.
Limits: Sounds cool, this book explains 3D and everything? I don't want pseudo-3D i want real 3D, like your engine. I'm very interested in learning how a game and it's engine works and I want to write one for my already existing 2D game to make it 3D.
object: Yes, that book is probably the best I have read, when it comes to showing how to implement 3D games in Java. It shows how to build your own software rasterizer, BSP trees, collision detection, AI (even self-learning ones) and a bunch more. No hardware accelerated graphics are covered. But it does cover what you need, from 2D to 3D and the basics as well as more advanced things, like shading. It does not cover how to build your own particle system, however. But you can always take a look at my implementation as a reference. My engine is based on it, as I said. Well, I did write everything on my own from scratch. But I have used that book as a reference for a lot of things.
Limits: I got the book and I have to say, it is very detailed and informative but I feel as though I'm not at that level in math or computer science in general. I'm 15 years old taking AP Computer Science starting this september and I'm going into pre-calculus. I simply cannot understand the terms and equations used to do all of this. Thank you however, I will definitely use this book in the future.
object: I suck at math too! ;) I barely knew what a vector was when I started with 3D programming. But that book has helped quite a lot. Well, I do have a few other books as well. Probably around 10 or so. But all the others are much harder to grasp, as they are all very theoretical. I know practically nothing when it comes to math notations. If I see an algorithm in code, that's a whole different story, however. I'm more pattern-oriented than math-oriented. But I guess math could be translated into patterns easily, as they're practically the same thing. Although I never figured that out. First I have to decipher the semantics of all used math notations. :)</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Question:

Limits: Hey I was wondering how I could get a 2D sprite in my 3D world, you know, as a NPC and stuff.
object: Well, the only thing I have used is polygons with transparent textures. Not really sprites then I guess. But it works somewhat.
Limits: Sounds good
Limits: How do you get transparent textures to be color indexed? GIMP doesnt seem to be able to do it.
object: The code in the book does not even support transparency, though. I had to fix that on my own first. But in GIMP you have this Magic Wand tool (I think that's the name of it). Just select the part you wish to make transparent and delete it. Or you can add a new alpha channel to the image from some of the menus (maybe the Layer menu, if that is the name of it).
Limits: How do I make it support transparency? Is it hard? And GIMP works for everything that doesnt have a transparent pixel in it.
object: I don't remember exactly what I had to change. It really wasn't that hard, though. By the way, why don't you figure things out on your own? Remember, you don't like crediting people. So, the best way for you to stick to that, is to think on your own. Or, consult Wikipedia and Google if you're really clueless about something.
Limits: Ok. and yeah I'd love to figure things out on my own if I knew where to start..
Limits: Hey, I've been working on this issue for the past two days for at least 12 hours each day. I read more in Brackeen's Java book and read that he uses "Index Transparency" I googled it but I couldn't find anything that allows me to do it in GIMP or anything. If you know could you please explain? Thank you so much, I feel bad for bothering you so much but I just don't know much about graphics.
object: I don't remember if I support transparency on shaded textures. But I do on normal textures (PowerOf2Texture). I changed it from RGB to ARGB (BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_ARGB). Then I updated all places where the RGB value was used, such that ARGB is used instead.
Limits: That would be terrific if Brackeen didn't use BufferedImage.TYPE_USHORT_565_RGB instead of TYPE_INT_(A)RGB for non shaded textures.</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">another question :P:

Limits: Hey, I read on your post about your game engine that it can load maps via xml? Do you have a sample .xml map?
object: Hey! Yes, it can load maps via XML. But it's not really that good. And, it shouldn't be that hard for you to figure out the format, by reading the code. No, I don't have an example file to give away.
Limits: Okay, thanks! I'm just trying to learn how XML works. Is it efficient?
object: XML is just a markup-language. So I cannot say it's neither efficient nor inefficient. If anything, it's quite verbose and takes up more space than other markup-languages, such as JSON, which probably means it will take longer to parse. But that shouldn't be of any concern to you. On the other hand, it's very similar to HTML, if you have ever used that? In fact, XHTML is actually based on XML, hence the X in the name.
Limits: Oh cool thanks! I'm just wondering if loading things off of a text file using my own 'syntax' instead of Xml is a better idea
object: That's entirely up to you to decide. If you decide to create your own format, you can create a less verbose one. Which of course is good. It's extremely easy to do, though, so go for it.
Limits: Ok thanks man</code></pre>

<p>im not 100% sure because im not a mathematician, but I dont think its called interpreting the vector, its like translating or transforming or something</p>

Yeah i was considering calling the method “transform” at first but the word seemed to vague and the word interpret seemed like it fit. I have two static classes in this project I believe… Surface and Camera, i didnt make them real classes because there is only one instance and all they do is manipulate some numbers</p>
<p>And ok i’ll rework the whole vector issue.</p>

        <p>just remember. an object shouldnt be using things outside of its scope. its ok to have the camera class be static if you want, but even in that case you should be passing the static reference around to the methods that need to use it rather than having objects call the static one all the time. makes it a nightmare if you ever decide to NOT make it static</p>
