    <title>Adding items [HELP]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-items-help/494766</link>
    <description>Hey,
I have been trying to add items to my server I am pretty sure ive done it right but when I spawn the item it isn&#39;t the item I tried adding.
I know its really hard to explain ill try giving a example.
So I have been trying to add the dragon kite. I have the models and I added them to the cache.(not sure it I do anything else with that)
I think it is something with the models I can equip the item and it goes to the shield slot but in the inventory
it look all weird its not even a item it says the name of the item and when I equip it looks like a bone sack or something.
All help will be appreciated. Thanks.</description>
