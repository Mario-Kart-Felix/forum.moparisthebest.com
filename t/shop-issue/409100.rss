    <description>Hey guys, 

I have a Slayer Master who gives tasks, and I get slayer points per task so that&#39;s all working. However I can&#39;t get my slayer master to have on his second option (trade) first option talk works perfect. I can&#39;t get a shop to get opened when I click on trade, anyone has some suggestions how I can fix this? So I can make a shop where I can spend slayer points.

I have a PI-based server.</description>
