    <title>Keyboard + mouse does&#39;t work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/keyboard-mouse-doest-work/66987</link>
    <description>whenever im in a server (including localhost), it really lags (which i know is a problem to everyone) and my wireless keyboard/mouse becomes almost unresponsive.  But whenever i exit a server, it works normally.  Is there anything that can clarify this problem?  or is it unresolvable like lag?</description>
