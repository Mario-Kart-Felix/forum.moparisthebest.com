    <description>&quot;Look at the rules here or you may be sorry&quot;

I&#39;d like to point out that the above is typical bullshit - just like most things on this forum. None of the rules are followed, and the staff never enforces. This forum definitely needs a lot of work..

<p>You can state it all you like, it dosen’t make it less BS. Personally, I don’t look at who’s posted something when I read the forums, until after I’ve read it and taken moderation if nessecary. I’ve muted/moderated my friends tons of times and not realised who it was until they bitch at me on msn. If anyone would like to point out examples of this corruption instead of just repeating what Greeny says, go ahead.</p>
<p>EDIT: That was weird, I mentioned Greeny completely off the cuff and he posted here just before me… ohai</p>

<p>And I may just be seeing the idiot vets that the staff are friends with who are doing the the flaming, cussing, spamming, ect. And the staff refuses to ban them - because of the reason above. They’re friends with them.</p>

              <p>I am not the “typical” people as I hardly reply to any threads here, but the staff are enforcing the rules if you would you around harder. Idiots on these forums complain how the moderators and admins are enforcing too much and now are saying they aren’t enforcing enough, they are in a fight they can’t win.  Moparisthebest recently finished his exams so he will be working on the forum more now, the other moderators are doing there job so this thread is useless.</p>
