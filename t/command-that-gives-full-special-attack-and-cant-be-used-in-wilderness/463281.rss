              <p>Extremely simple dude, if you can do things like this I don’t see the point in starting private servers. Not being harsh at all.</p>
<p>You’ll need to set your special attack variable to 100 when the command is executed.</p>
<p>For the wilderness part, make an if statement to check if they’re in the wilderness and send them a message or something if they are. If not, set the special attack to 100.</p>
