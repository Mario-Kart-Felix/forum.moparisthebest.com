    <title>It&#39;s been four years</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/its-been-four-years/373299</link>
    <description>I&#39;m asking for a summary on the reason why I have never seen a server with custom textures and new added land/objects/effects on to the actual game map in the past four years?

I have recently come back to private servers, I used to play them four years ago but there really seems to be no longevity in private servers because of my question above.</description>

<p>I’m wondering, why does everyone avoid such a thing? Is it really hard/long to make?</p>

<p>Not just moving objects, literally a new area on the map.</p>
