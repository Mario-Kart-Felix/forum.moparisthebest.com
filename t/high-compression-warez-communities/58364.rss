    <title>High compression warez communities?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/high-compression-warez-communities/58364</link>
    <description>Does any one know any forums or sites which use high compression on their warez?

I know a while back they used to be very popular with slow internet as a few hundred mb could be compressed down to around 50mb etc.

More specifically im looking for games. As i have a fairly small download cap i would prefere to download compressed wares to save my quota for actual gaming.

for those who dont believe me about the compression i believe UHARC (or something like that) can compress very strongly and there is another one capable of compressing 1 gig into under 100mb.

The downside of this is it does take a long time to decompress but all i care about right now is being able to download them.

edit: one of the most common archivers i believe they use : http://kgbarchiver.net/</description>
