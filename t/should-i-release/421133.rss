    <title>Should I release?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/should-i-release/421133</link>
    <description>I&#39;m having a lot of troubles at home,
and a lot of personal shit;
due this I don&#39;t feel like coding anymore,
So I&#39;m thinking about releasing my server (see signature)
But not the version I&#39;m at now but an older version of fantasy world.

I still want to keep the newest version (where is still worked on, by rodrigo I barely do anything anymore.)
So If I manage to get some money here, might going to host it.
Else it&#39;s for rodrigo

So what ya think should I release it so people can make it better instead of me doing nothing?</description>

              <p>I doubt many people in the general discussion section really care, tend do program our own shit as opposed to downloading a pre ready feature packed server programmed by someone else.</p>
<p>Doesn’t deserve a thread, release it or don’t.</p>
