    <title>Could I do GWD? Got any tips for me?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/could-i-do-gwd-got-any-tips-for-me/354303</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve been training my combat like crazy (78 to 102 in about 3 weeks, only about 7 days of actually playing though)

So my first question, do you think that I could do Bandos GWD? In a team? How many others would I need?

Here are my stats/equipment: (obviously I will be melle&#39;ing)

If there is anyone with a lot of GWD experience, can you tell me how often you get a good drop in the throne room? Can you give any tips that are not listed in normal guides?

Thanks. :)</description>

<p>Nah, you don’t need to wait that long, bandos is easy as fuck man. I’ve been doing it since i was 100 cb and like 50 prayer, even at that low alli took was 3 p pots and an inven of sharks, i had friends that helped me get on teams etc. Then once i got 110 cb it got easy, with the 110+ teams then moved up combat and all it did was get eaiser. Now all i take is 1 p pot sharks super sets andfruit bats/bunyips. Its soo easy, no reason to wait until you max combat etc, if boss gets on you ull drop as fast as a max cb=a lvl 100. He 2 hits kids all the time that don’t know what their doing.</p>

<p>Most masses will only accept lvl 110+, lvl 115+, etc. You also need a godsword, as unless you have extreme potions and d claws they won’t accept a whip. I’ve joined several masses in the past few days and they all had either a 115+ or 120+ requirement.</p>

<p>Also called a tank, but they don’t need range. They need guthans and high defense, in which they attack Graardor first and then attack a minion to heal while Graardor attacks him. After Graardor is dead, they heal on the ranged minion while the rest of the team kills the mage one and finally the melee.[/quote]I already stated, we did a full trip, I was allowed to use a whip with just supers… I have no idea what you are talking about. We had 1 tank which was a torag, 1 ranger, and 2 people with whips.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/everyone">@Everyone</a> - No more ranged suggestions, I wont need it; as I already stated I will be doing Bandos and wearing veracs.<br>
I’m using the tip.it guide for this and it says what I’m wearing is fine.</p>
