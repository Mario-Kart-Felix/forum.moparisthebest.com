    <title>How to start rsps via putty?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-start-rsps-via-putty/542705</link>
    <description>Sorry. i didnt know where to post. if this is in the wrong area then please tellme where to post!Hi. I have a vps with beastnode.com. i followed this guide here http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/google/tutorials/313304-running-your-rsps-linux-server-ubuntu.html my OS on my vps is ubuntu 32bit. I&#39;ve been using putty as the guide had told me to. i only encounter errors on step 10. which is where you actually run the server. Here is what it told me to do. i dont get it what so ever. 
Step 10: Were nearly done! Now to put your server online its very simple

first open your old run.bat for your server, then copy and paste the line that starts with &#39;java&#39; if it starts with &quot;C://program files/............&quot; then just replace it with java. Now you can either

add the word nohup to the start like so

&#39;nohup java server&#39;

or

&#39;java server &amp;&#39;

both of these will make your server run as a process (i.e not close once it starts running) if you want to test is it starting correctly first you can just execute the command as normally and it should run fine.

So i went into my run.bat file and hit right clicked and hit &quot;edit&quot; and this is what it says in my run.bat:
@echo off
title Nexon-World (43594)
java -client -Xmx512m -cp bin;lib/* org.dementhium.RS2ServerBootstrap
pause

so now if i could be told by somebody how to start my server with the info above that would help.

Thanks!@@@@@@@@@@</description>
