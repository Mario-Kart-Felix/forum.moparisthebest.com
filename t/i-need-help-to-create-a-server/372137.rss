              <p>Try <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this.</a></p>
<p>Since RuneScape Private Servers are written in Java,</p>
<p>It is essential to understand basic Java first,</p>
<p>So I would start by going through those tutorials, They are pretty great.</p>
