    <description>Hey MoparScape community,

Quick Introduction of myself, I have an advanced knowledge on how Linux works, I am a full time full stack perl developer for a living and some friends and I decided we want to get a PI server up and running 3 developers is a little small so we&#39;re looking for a couple more, we&#39;ll be using Git for version control if you don&#39;t know what that is, I&#39;ll teach you, but if you have git experience, it&#39;s going to be a huge step.
