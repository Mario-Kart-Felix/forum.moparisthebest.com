RSC client hacking and cheating, followed by neglect on Jagex's part lead to the scene. Eventually releasing RSCDv25 to the public hindered development completely. Adding content is a bitch (not so much now as before but can still be improved in the public sources) and every noob that comes along instantly gets slammed. We all dream of 1,000 players on a private server but yet instantly bash the idiot scrub for not knowing how to register.</blockquote>I don't agree that releasing RSCD has hindered development at all. Its release did exactly the opposite; tons of people then were interested in making servers because now  they had a decent source to work with. They could actually focus on adding the content they wanted to add instead of worrying about dupes, bugs or writing their own server source. In an already small community, hiding sources to make profit or to eliminate competition is irresponsible.
<p>People getting “slammed” is another thing. I think the people who are g etting slammed here are the ones that want to develop a server but have no intention on actually learning how to program. The kinds of people who want to be spoonfed and have illusions of grandeur about how well their server is going to succeed.</p>
<p>The good thing about releasing sources is that it gives the people who want to learn more to look at, and provides them with a benchmark essentially.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong though, writing your own source and figuring out the protocol can be a fun and challenging task, but it isn’t very practical unless you’re really devoted or someone’s paying you.</p>

<p>Well sorry guys, but I hate to break the truth to you. Someone spending hours of effort writing software and then hosting it costs time and money (which really boils down to money and money). Your distrust doesn’t change that.</p>

</aside>
<p>You missed the point mate. Everyone knows that. Simply hosting a server that isn’t going to be brought down cost almost $500 a month.<br>
The problem is, that there is no people in the community who you could trust with giving that money to. Seriously think of someone trustworthy<br>
that is also competent enough to host the server. Ok now you maybe thought of 3 at most. Now how many of them actually want to host it?</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I see your point. I would be ok with paying $10 a month to play a good server. But the community leaders aren’t there.</p>

<p>I would then accept the fact that classic is outdated in terms of game mechanics but appreciate the graphics and adventure. You could defiantly get rid of the shit top left blue selection menu and change it to a black box with text options. All items should be batched and the game skilling wise should become slightly easier. The ability to travel the world should be based a carting system, if you pay nacional he will give you a ride. Walking long distances kills the game but adds to the grind, appropriate changes should be made to take stress off of the player. RSC from a legit players point of view (Yea I had like 1760ish total on rsc before heading into rs2) is tedious and stressful. If I recall correctly, it took lightning over 5 million clicks just to get 99 fletching. We have taken the stress off the players by bumping up the exp rate but that does nothing. Oh and if you change something, it’s the end of the world because RSCers are stuck in 2002.</p>
<p>Lothy, I do not concur. There are a few of us that actively seek the communities best interest and are willing to spend the hours and effort to make it a better place but the change that occurs from such work is minimal to nothing at all and that’s dissatisfying. However it does help to have a community that supports the product financially or with the proper feedback rather than just botting away at it.</p>
<p>But to get the the point of the thread, yes. Yes there is.</p>

The problem is that you guys expect someone to develop and host a polished product at their own expense.

<p>I see your point. But on the flipside, many admins have gotten greedy and simply reset to get more money or run away with the money.[/quote]<br>
