    <description>[b]Project name:[/b]
MegaRender

[b]Talent needed:[/b]
PHP and mySQL, and anything else that might be helpful in creating a shop. This isn&#39;t an easy job, it will require an immense amount of coding and knowledge. 

[b]Brief description:[/b]
MegaRender is a site I will be starting up involving a 3D modelling store and a large interactive forum. 
It is a store where anyone may sell models to other users. You would start by making an account on the website(which will be the same account on the forums). The user would have a control panel where they may set up their own shop, or change their profile information, etc. In the shop menu, they could upload a 3D model [b]that they have made[/b]. They have to select what filetypes it is available in, provide a screenshot, type in some keywords and a description. It would then be added to their own shop. Every shop has it&#39;s own url that they may freely advertise on other websites and stuff. I can provide a large list of 3D model filetypes for you, and I will do most of the research and make sure your informed on everything. Anyways, the seller of the model has to set a price, say how many polygons, if it&#39;s animated or not, etc.. I strongly advise you take a look at turbosquid.com to find out what I am looking for. Anyways, when the shop is viewed, users can see thumbnails of each model for sale, when they 
click on the thumbnail all the information such as a larger screenshot, polygons, description, etc, will be displayed. They can then purchase the model if they want to. When a model is purchased 10% of the sale will go directly to my PayPal account, and 90% will go to the seller. If you take a look at turbosquid, they take over 50% of your profit, that&#39;s not very fair if you ask me. Turbosquid doesn&#39;t really have user-owned shops, they just have a large gallery of each model, but as an example of a page take a look at this: http://www.turbosquid.com/FullPreview/Index.cfm/ID/255404
When going into the main shop at MegaRender, it will display the models just like it does on turbosquid. The top viewed models will be at the top of the list, and perhaps there will be 10-15 models per page. Like I said, this is too confusing to think about so take a look at turbosquid.com. There will also be a search bar that will search for the keywords of each model. It will display them all the same way. The shop will be 100% automatic, so just keep that in mind. Mod&#39;s and Admins will have the ability to remove models at the click of a button. As for the forum, it will probably be vBulletin, maybe SMF(with a cool theme though). It will have discussions in lots of stuff, such as 3D modelling, animating, photoshop, game design, programming, creative writing, etc. Basically an art forum. IT IS NOT RUNESCAPE RELATED :P I can provide a lot more information if you are interested.

[b]Work Conditions:[/b]
You have no deadline, you work when you want if you want. It&#39;d be nice to have it done by Setember though. You need to code pretty much the entire site, I will add the content and stuff like that. You will understand that if I need something changed, you will do it, or if I need to add in a new feature, you will do it. I&#39;m easy to get along with, very easy so no worries about that :P I can provide you with several web templates off of templatemonster or something as well, so you don&#39;t have to design the website layout unless you want to. You also agree that you will edit any template I give you to make sure that it fits in our needs and stuff. Such as changing or moving objects around. Before you get paid, the site must be up and running and fully functional and secure. Yes we will have a .com domain, yes we will have some decent hosting(maybe even a dedicated server). You can be an admin on the site as long as you are mature and stuff. 

[b]Compensation:[/b]
Yes I will pay you, how you get paid is up to you, pick one of these:

1 payment of $500.00 USD. I will not have this ready for a long time. I am only 15 years old, I wont have 500 dollars for at least a year I bet(or.. possibly the end of summer :P). I am a man of my word though, you will get paid. And I am really hoping you don&#39;t pick this payment choice :P

or:

50% of the site&#39;s profit for 5 years. Yes the site will be up for at least 5 years, I hope to have it up my whole life :P You can be a site admin, and you just get to sit back and relax while the site makes some cash. It wont start making anything worthy for around a year, but I bet within a few months some cash will be racked in. You are guarenteed to make at least 750 dollars within the 5 years or else I will personally pay you another 500.   


[b]And other stuff:[/b]
What makes this site different then turbosquid? What makes us better? Why even try competing against the largest 3D resource website?

Simple, users are sick and tired of turbosquid. Turbosquid is your only option for selling models on a website like that. Turbosquid has no real/solid community, and the users are crowding it with useless ugly models that charge you an arm and a leg for, simply because turbosquid is taking over 53% of their profit. Like I said, we would only take 10%. Game developers are always looking for 3D models, you&#39;d be suprised how far they are willing to go in payments. A fully rigged character can sell for over 300 dollars. 10% of that is 30 dollars, and I would imagine if it&#39;s good, it would be sold at least 5 times or more. 30*5 = 150 dollars for us. Now thats just one model, think of the thousands of models for sale. It&#39;s time to give turbosquid some competition, game developers are all avoiding turbosquid now and this is where we need to swoop in while we can before the Chinese find out how profitable 3D modelling can be(I&#39;m serious).

Just post below if you are interested in coding this for me. This could be a real oppurtunity, but only if your willing to help.

Thanks.</description>

              <p><span class="bbcode-b">Project name:</span><br>
MegaRender</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Talent needed:</span><br>
PHP and mySQL, and anything else that might be helpful in creating a shop. This isn’t an easy job, it will require an immense amount of coding and knowledge.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Brief description:</span><br>
MegaRender is a site I will be starting up involving a 3D modelling store and a large interactive forum.<br>
It is a store where anyone may sell models to other users. You would start by making an account on the website(which will be the same account on the forums). The user would have a control panel where they may set up their own shop, or change their profile information, etc. In the shop menu, they could upload a 3D model <span class="bbcode-b">that they have made</span>. They have to select what filetypes it is available in, provide a screenshot, type in some keywords and a description. It would then be added to their own shop. Every shop has it’s own url that they may freely advertise on other websites and stuff. I can provide a large list of 3D model filetypes for you, and I will do most of the research and make sure your informed on everything. Anyways, the seller of the model has to set a price, say how many polygons, if it’s animated or not, etc… I strongly advise you take a look at <a href="http://turbosquid.com" rel="nofollow noopener">turbosquid.com</a> to find out what I am looking for. Anyways, when the shop is viewed, users can see thumbnails of each model for sale, when they<br>
click on the thumbnail all the information such as a larger screenshot, polygons, description, etc, will be displayed. They can then purchase the model if they want to. When a model is purchased 10% of the sale will go directly to my PayPal account, and 90% will go to the seller. If you take a look at turbosquid, they take over 50% of your profit, that’s not very fair if you ask me. Turbosquid doesn’t really have user-owned shops, they just have a large gallery of each model, but as an example of a page take a look at this: <a href="http://www.turbosquid.com/FullPreview/Index.cfm/ID/255404" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.turbosquid.com/FullPreview/Index.cfm/ID/255404</a><br>
When going into the main shop at MegaRender, it will display the models just like it does on turbosquid. The top viewed models will be at the top of the list, and perhaps there will be 10-15 models per page. Like I said, this is too confusing to think about so take a look at <a href="http://turbosquid.com" rel="nofollow noopener">turbosquid.com</a>. There will also be a search bar that will search for the keywords of each model. It will display them all the same way. The shop will be 100% automatic, so just keep that in mind. Mod’s and Admins will have the ability to remove models at the click of a button. As for the forum, it will probably be vBulletin, maybe SMF(with a cool theme though). It will have discussions in lots of stuff, such as 3D modelling, animating, photoshop, game design, programming, creative writing, etc. Basically an art forum. IT IS NOT RUNESCAPE RELATED <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I can provide a lot more information if you are interested.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Work Conditions:</span><br>
You have no deadline, you work when you want if you want. It’d be nice to have it done by Setember though. You need to code pretty much the entire site, I will add the content and stuff like that. You will understand that if I need something changed, you will do it, or if I need to add in a new feature, you will do it. I’m easy to get along with, very easy so no worries about that <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I can provide you with several web templates off of templatemonster or something as well, so you don’t have to design the website layout unless you want to. You also agree that you will edit any template I give you to make sure that it fits in our needs and stuff. Such as changing or moving objects around. Before you get paid, the site must be up and running and fully functional and secure. Yes we will have a .com domain, yes we will have some decent hosting(maybe even a dedicated server). You can be an admin on the site as long as you are mature and stuff.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Compensation:</span><br>
Yes I will pay you, how you get paid is up to you, pick one of these:</p>
<p>1 payment of $500.00 USD. I will not have this ready for a long time. I am only 15 years old, I wont have 500 dollars for at least a year I bet(or… possibly the end of summer :P). I am a man of my word though, you will get paid. And I am really hoping you don’t pick this payment choice <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>or:</p>
<p>50% of the site’s profit for 5 years. Yes the site will be up for at least 5 years, I hope to have it up my whole life <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> You can be a site admin, and you just get to sit back and relax while the site makes some cash. It wont start making anything worthy for around a year, but I bet within a few months some cash will be racked in. You are guarenteed to make at least 750 dollars within the 5 years or else I will personally pay you another 500.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">And other stuff:</span><br>
What makes this site different then turbosquid? What makes us better? Why even try competing against the largest 3D resource website?</p>
<p>Simple, users are sick and tired of turbosquid. Turbosquid is your only option for selling models on a website like that. Turbosquid has no real/solid community, and the users are crowding it with useless ugly models that charge you an arm and a leg for, simply because turbosquid is taking over 53% of their profit. Like I said, we would only take 10%. Game developers are always looking for 3D models, you’d be suprised how far they are willing to go in payments. A fully rigged character can sell for over 300 dollars. 10% of that is 30 dollars, and I would imagine if it’s good, it would be sold at least 5 times or more. 30*5 = 150 dollars for us. Now thats just one model, think of the thousands of models for sale. It’s time to give turbosquid some competition, game developers are all avoiding turbosquid now and this is where we need to swoop in while we can before the Chinese find out how profitable 3D modelling can be(I’m serious).</p>
<p>Just post below if you are interested in coding this for me. This could be a real oppurtunity, but only if your willing to help.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
