    <description>Recording All Music on Computer

I made a tutorial for recording music to cover your tracks when downloading illegal music. I would hate to do it manually though, especially people who have more than 10 songs, which is everyone lol. Anyone think they can make a scar script?

It needs to read each song in Windows Media Player or some other media player, get its name, make the new file that name, get information on its length, start the song and record it, then end the recording when the song is finished, and finally start on the next song until all songs are finished.

Seems troublesome. I hope someone could make something like that though. Unless there is already a music recording program with a built in playlist that you could add files to and it will automatically record them over without you having to manually record each one. :)

Thank you.
