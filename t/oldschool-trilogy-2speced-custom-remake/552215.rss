    <description>OldSchool Trilogy info:
Well Have Anyone else played 2speced rsps?
It was an old school pking server with tons of people pking anytime of every day.
well even though it had glitched combat, no gdw, and was easy to level &amp; make money to go pking shortly after starting people still loved it and played it all the time.
It shut down years ago and ever since i have played over 100+ rsps and even spent time downloading rsps after rsps in attempt to find a similar rsps that i enjoyed as much but the few times i found one they where offline within a few months
or was too much eco base or something.
I decided to attempt to make a Remake of it using a different base because delta was so bugged on 06/01/15
That RSPS would be &quot;Oldschool Trilogy&quot;.

[SIZE=3]OS Trilogy is going to be a oldschool pking server that is easy to level and semi easy on making money so that players can get the stats and gear then need to pk within a short period of time after starting. (like 2speced)[/SIZE]

[SIZE=5]Need Testers[/SIZE]

I Did not want to post showoff untill i got farther along or nearly ready to host but i decided to post cause im getting to the point where i am starting to need multiple testers &amp; some graphics made for me.
-should be able to find me on[SIZE=3] skype by searching &quot;trilogyreborn&quot; or &quot;mike allen&quot; profile pic is kril and says trilogy reborn[/SIZE].
