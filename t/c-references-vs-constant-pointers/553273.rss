    <title>C++ references vs constant pointers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/c-references-vs-constant-pointers/553273</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve started learning some c++ and I am wondering what is more efficient to use, a reference or a constant pointer? does anyone happen to know the answer? and also what is the difference between them? If there are many differences, what would be the best time to use one over the other?</description>

              <p>a reference is a const pointer, not to be confused to a pointer to a const, that is basically syntactical sugar. it allows you to use the dot accessor notation (myObject.func()) instead of dereference-access (myObject-&gt;fun()).</p>

Also, this isn’t exactly relevant but it’s something to be mindful of. Don’t become too obsessed with performance and how efficient something is. Write for readability and good design. Then if it has trouble, modify it. Too many people try writing code that’s pre-optimised and it turns into a mess. Optimisation requires a lot of understanding about what’s happening in the background and when you focus on this too early, you get lost down the rabbit hole.</p>

This. I’ve seem many cases in C where people use premature optimization in order to make their apps “efficient”. Readability is always the key! Just optimize where necessary.</p>

              <p>You’re getting bogged down in things you don’t need to be bogged down in. Learn about pointers and how they work. Write a program that sends addresses flying around and output a few so you know what’s happening.</p>
