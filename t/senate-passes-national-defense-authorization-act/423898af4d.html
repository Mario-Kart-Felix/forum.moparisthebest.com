<p>That police nation that bullies other nations accused of possessing without being signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. But Israel, the illegal state which is not a signatory, has too much influence in American politics (AIPAC etc.) for any politician to even dare criticize it.</p>

If you are going strict by the definition, a communist state would be an oxymoron.<br>
If you are going by the goals of communism, where the workers control the country and you have equality, then China wouldn’t qualify since the democracy there is very weak and you have a big inequality among the population.<br>

<p>We could have the same debate about whether the USA is a true democracy.  Nothing made by humans is ever a perfect anything.</p>
<p>The bottom line is, with communism, is that it is a decent concept.  If everything worked like it was spelled out, it would be a great form of government and everyone would be equal, have enough food, and be singing and dancing in the streets.  The problem is that, due to human greed, and other various factors, it would NEVER work out that way.  This is because someone has to collect and dole out supplies, and they will inevitably keep the most/best for themselves and friends/family/people who bribe them etc.  Also, if everyone from the guy who sits around and drinks beer all day, all the way up to the guy who studies 24/7 to better himself and discover new technologies, or doctors etc are perfectly equal, what motivation would there be to NOT sit around and drink beer all day?  Those are just two flaws stopping ‘true communism’ from ever working in the real world.</p>
<p>But the USSR, Cuba, and China (among others I’m sure) set out to be communist countries, so I don’t think it’s wrong to call them that.  Just like it’s not wrong to call the USA a democracy, even though each and every individual doesn’t personally decide and vote on each and every issue.</p>

<p>They aren’t true Marxist communist. Basically what happened is, after Marx created the communist manifesto, a lot of countries decided to declare themselves as “communist” (since it seemed like such a great idea), as a ploy to gain power. That very idea contradicts the purpose of communism, which is why these countries are not communist.</p>
<p>In all honesty, true communism cannot really exist with a government, because its core concept is that no one person is superior to another. The socialistic “share the wealth” principle these countries borrowed from Marx is actually not as important in true Marxist communism. The core principle isn’t about everyone having the same stuff, it’s about no one being able to dominate over anyone else (which is exactly what Marx believed happens in capitalism).</p>
<p>With that in mind, there are no true communist countries. All of the countries which consider themselves communist want power and they would never give it up.</p>

</aside>
<p>The various communist ideologies do deal with this.</p>
<p>That said, even if they didn’t - why WOULD people sit around and drink beer all day? I’ve sat around doing nothing for long periods of time - it sucks dick. Eventually, most people will start doing things, just to escape it.</p>
<p>In Star Trek (lol, quoting sci fi in a serious discussion, but bear with me) humanity has advanced to the point where they can support themselves with practically no effort - so money becomes non existent. Those officers that work on the various starbases etc., the doctors the psychologists, they’re all unpaid, because money would be worthless, everyone has what they need. They have a society where people do what they do because they love doing it, and if there’s nothing they really excel at, then whatever, they do nothing and they survive fine.</p>
<p>Of course, we are not that Utopian society, but - is it such a terrible idea? If we got to a point technologically where we could survive like that, would you begrudge the people who sat around doing nothing? One of the effects of this in Star Treks society seems to be that most people are incredibly good at their job (OK, we only really see starfleet, so its biased, but those guys are fucking DRIVEN). In our society even, we don’t (or, most don’t) begrudge people who survive on the bare minimum in order to fulfill some sort of life goal (artists living on &lt; minimum wage etc.) - but they aren’t contributing to society tangibly, either. Where do you see that the individuals responsibility to “contribute” lies?</p>

<p>Also, if everyone from the guy who sits around and drinks beer all day, all the way up to the guy who studies 24/7 to better himself and discover new technologies, or doctors etc are perfectly equal, what motivation would there be to NOT sit around and drink beer all day?</p>

</aside>
<p>this can only be anecdotal but a lot of doctors and scientists don’t do their job for money or fame, a lot of them do their jobs simply to help other people as silly as it may sound</p>
<p>I think you may be underestimating the average person though, charities wouldn’t exist if there wasn’t a drive to help others for no immediate benefit to themselves</p>

<p>Just like it’s not wrong to call the USA a democracy, even though each and every individual doesn’t personally decide and vote on each and every issue.</p>

</aside>
<p>well isn’t that the reason you, or we rather have politicians? because every single issue cannot be voted on? it doesn’t necessarily detract from being a true democracy</p>
