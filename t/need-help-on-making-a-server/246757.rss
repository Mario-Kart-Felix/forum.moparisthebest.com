    <description>[b] :confused:I Need some help :confused:[/b]

Ok first i am very new to this i barely know anything about it.
But about 2 days ago i tried making a server so me and my friend could go on it.(i wanted it so he would just need to put it in silab not download anything) But then i followed the tutorial on how to in the other topic from storm and i got to where it says port forwarding. It seemed hard so i didnt do it. Then when i went to go on Finallbarage (not advertising but it is a great server) it said i couldnt load it cuz something to do with java.That happend when i changed my enviromental variables.now that i got everything fixed i wanna try doing it again.Is there a way i can do it with out changing the enviromental variables or portforwarding? (i have made a no-ip thing already) just can some1 make a very simple for the stpid (me) tutorial on how to do this (add pictures if you could please)</description>

              <p>ok here are the things u need:</p>
<ul>
<li>router</li>
<li>no-ip</li>
<li>JDK 5 or 6</li>
<li>Brain</li>
<li>Computer</li>
<li>Source</li>
<li>winRAR</li>
</ul>
<p>What you do first is get a source whch you can find in the download section ( don’t download till u getwinRaR so you can unzip the file with winrar). Second you need JDK 5 or 6 what you do is go to <a href="http://java.sun.com" rel="nofollow noopener">java.sun.com</a> and download it. Then you need to install it. Then you need winRaR witch you can get bye going to <a href="http://download.com" rel="nofollow noopener">download.com</a> and searching winrar. get the latest version. Now you need a no-ip. You can get this by going to <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a> making an account. Then there should be something like add host or something like that. You click on that then you type in the name that you want people to use to get on. Also so you can update your ip you need to go to <a href="http://download.com" rel="nofollow noopener">download.com</a> and upload no-ip DUC. Next you go to your firewall then going to the second tab (can’t remember the specific name, but you should see a list of items with check boxes next to them). When you get there you  do add port then add your server name which u made at <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a>. Then you add the port which is 43594, and check it to be UCD. The you make another one except change it from UCD to the other one (again can’t rememb the name). Next you need to go to run which youll find on the start menu and search cmd. when you get the type “ipconfig” and you should find you ip address. Open a new internet and type that in the address box. It should take you to your routers main page. I don’t know what router you have, but what I do you should see something named virtual servers or somethin like that. open that then go to the defult. When you do that you should see this:</p>
<p><a href="http://img397.imageshack.us/my.php?image=portsnw5.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img397.imageshack.us/img397/4864/portsnw5.th.png" alt width="" height=""></a><br>
This is what it looks like for me. Ignore the XBOX ports that is for me. But what u do is look at the RSPC and you do exactly what that says. Make everything the same at that picture. What this will do is allow others to play on your server. I think that is it.</p>
<p>Unziping the source:<br>
-frst make sure you have winrar before you download it. When you download it a winrar window should open with the file in it what you do is look up at the tool bar and you will find extract. You extract the file to my documents. Then go into my documents and you should be able to run it.</p>
<p>If you have any questions pm me.</p>
