    <title>Should marijuana be legalised?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/should-marijuana-be-legalised/95096</link>
    <description>Well at the moment im really pissed off. Im from the west midlands (England) And recently the police are cracking down HARD on weed dealers. Now usually this wouldn&#39;t be a problem, apart from the fact that prices around here have risen from around £15 (about $28, still alot in US terms) for an eigth (3.5 grams) to £25 (About $45) and its hard to get hold off.

Now consider this, we have alot of potheads around here, and dealers are falling short. They cant afford to buy anymore and when they do its hard to obtain because the police have been cracking down, meanwhile harder drugs are alot cheaper and fairly easy to obtain. What are they going to do? 

Another thing that really annoys me is the education we get in the U.K over drugs. I can renember throughout my yonger years in secondary and primary school we would have lessons pretty much every week telling us about how bad marijuana is and how easy it is to get addicted. They tell you all the bad facts and lie to you to convince you to avoid the magical herb. Now with all these lies and controvesy lieing in your head, most people will at least try it once, and it makes you think. If its relitivly harmless  and hard to get addicted, what about all the other things the goverment have been trying to make us avoid?

I think at least the youth of today should be told the pro&#39;s and con&#39;s of cannabis, not just lies to make sure we avoid it. Also im looked down upon by society because i smoke it. So what? I know its not good for me but its my life and I make my own choices, just like somebody else may choose to get a tatoo or drink. 

Personally im sick of all the crap the goverment have been telling us to avoid something that shouldn&#39;t even take priority over alcohol. If it was legalised and education over drugs was imrpoved to give us the facts not the lies, maybe this country wouldnt be so bad?

I don&#39;t know, what are your opinions?</description>

<p>The reason I say Yes for marijuana is because have you ever heard anyone who has died from it?</p>
<p>I havent. Look at Willie Nelson. He is the biggest pothead you could find. Hows he doing? Just fine.</p>
<p>The government needs to crack down on stuff like speed and cocaine, the stuff thats dragging down our society.</p>
<p>I have never in my life heard the school tell us about crack or speed. Nope, all they tell us about is weed.</p>
<p>Marijuana is not the big problem in our society. Cigarettes are worse than marijuana! Weed is not as addicting as cigarettes.</p>
<p>I, personally, have never smoked weed. Ive never done any drugs. Yet, I find no harm in marijuana.</p>
<p>So, all in all, I agree with you.</p>
<p>Edit: ahh, sorry about the double spaces everywhere…I just kind of get into a habit of doing that…IMO it makes it easier to read.</p>

Actually you can get addicted, I know 2 people who are. Look on erowid, if you smoke reguarly (as in daily) over a period of about a ear you start to get withdrawal symptoms from not smoking.[/quote]</p>
<p>Now I’m sure a lot of people will agree and disagree with me on this, but smoking every day in a consistent rate gets you into a routine, it will make you feel addicted because your not doing something you do on a day to day basis, also, it could ruin the drug by not giving powerful effects unless you buy more, witch for some people might be hard to do.[/quote]<br>
Lol, some call that mental addiction but I think as you said it’s just that they enjoy smoking and are used to it not any kind of an addiction…</p>

Erowid is a great site but it’s not exactly the most credible site. A lot of their info is user submitted.</p>
<p>I smoke pot almost everyday, although sometimes I will go a week without it. I have never experienced any sort of withdrawal symptoms. It is not physically addictive like cigarettes or heroin. It is addictive in the same way as masturbation is addictive. It’s just fun and feels good so you wanna do it a lot because of that.</p>

<p>Actually, I hope Jamie decides to ban Fazed3000. Creating 2 accounts is against the rules, EVADING A BAN is a severe thing to do.</p>
<blockquote>And to the post above, theres alot of difference between crack and pot, but I see where your getting. If marijuana was legalised it wouldnt set a very good example for hard drug users, soon they will be campaining to leagalise there choice of drug and before you know it everything is out of control.</blockquote>
<p>Oh look, an undereducated moron. Cannabis has been used for at least eight thousand years, with the Chinese eating the seeds. Cannabis only became illegal in around 1960’s where a lot of things became illegal because of moron scientists not knowing what there talking about. EATING cannabis is not harmful, the worse happening is becoming sick and throwing up, maybe feeling dizzy. It does no longterm damage like drugs such as cocaine, smack and other things. Cannabis is completely natural, and in some cases can help people. You can’t compare cannabis to other drugs because it’s completely different. Legalizing a perfectly non-harmful drug won’t lead to the legalizing of harmful drugs.</p>
<blockquote>IRL to Got_Shine (again lol) I agree with you, I dont see the need to mindlessly smoke weed or any other type of drug leading to addiction. It makes som of the more honest tokers look bad. Although we were taught about addiction, which turned out to be another lie (which really is the worst part to lie about) which was you become addicted after your first spliff.</blockquote>
<p>Again I’ll call you an undereducated moron, don’t talk about shit you don’t know. Cannabis isn’t addictive, and you don’t suffer withdrawal symptoms like you do with <span class="bbcode-b">coffee</span>, <span class="bbcode-b">normal cigarettes</span>, or in some cases, <span class="bbcode-b">nicotine patches</span>. It’s like masturbation, <span class="bbcode-b">fun to do</span>, relieves stress and makes you feel good.</p>

<p>Again, back to this, you can’t “report” this, you MUST <span class="bbcode-b">report it to an administrator</span>, even if you do that, you’ll be ignored since he’s done nothing wrong.</p>

 Eh Pretty Easy:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>It shouldn’t be legalized, since the whole world is crappy already, we don’t want/need people saying “Crack, want some crack?” when you’re going to lunch.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This debate is about marijuana, not crack. The legalization of marijuana will not effect the crack smokers. As far as I’m concerned if people want to smoke crack let them but you can keep it far away from me.</p>
<p>The thing is, people don’t care if it’s illegal or not. If someone wants to smoke marijuana, they are going to do it. If someone wants to drink under aged, they will do it.</p>
<p>Anyways, although I would rather decriminalization(because it would do me better) here are some benefits of legalizing marijuana.</p>
<p>Well, this is just California. Imagine the entire US.</p>
<blockquote>California NORML estimates that a legal market for marijuana could yield the state $1.5 - $2.5 billion. A basic $1 per joint excise tax would yield about $1 billion to the state, while the state would save over $150 million in enforcement costs for arrests, prosecutions and prison. Additional benefits would accrue from sales taxes and spinoff industries. Total retail sales of marijuana would be on the order of $3-$5 billion, with total economic impact of $8-$13 billion including spinoff industries such as coffeehouses, tourism, and industrial hemp.</blockquote>
<p>I’m not so much in the mood for typing right now so I thought I would quote some stuff from various websites.</p>
<blockquote>Ever wake up feeling really hung over from a night of smoking out? Thought not. Throw in some heavy drinking, though, and you'll awake feeling like death itself (in fact, alcohol poisoning is a real risk). No one overdoses on marijuana because it has a negligible therapeutic ratio; that is, you don't have to use much to get the desired effect. Why then is one drug available from corner stores and allowed to be promoted at bowling tournaments, whereas the other you have to get from a pimply guy with a mullet you knew vaguely in high school, who hands you something dodgy-looking in a sandwich baggie? Quit the hypocrisy and make these intoxicants equally available.</blockquote>
<blockquote>When corn sells for a few dollars a bushel and pot goes for $70,000 a bushel, guess which one cash-strapped midwestern farmers are going to grow?
...
Marijuana has replaced corn as America's top cash crop, and is really tough to detect tucked away in fields of corn. A legal regime that turns ordinary farmers into the worst class of offenders (growers) has something deeply wrong with it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The war on drugs will only be won if we're willing to turn our country into a police state, and that is what these draconian laws are doing for us.</blockquote>
I especially agree with this. I mean billions and billions of dollars are spent to prevent Joe Blow from smoking marijuana. Although they haven't gotten too far with that other then putting law abiding citizens(except for the marijuana laws of course) in jail or making them pay massive fines with a criminal record. And lets not forget intruding their privacy and rights. 
<blockquote>Stiffer sentencing has meant jails overcrowded with drug offenders, forcing the early release of violent criminals - inclluding murderers - to make room for guys who've been handed mandatory life terms without the possibility of parole for their "third strike." America is now the world's greatest jailor nation, with a prison population consisting overwhelmingly of drug offenders. On average, we sentence nonviolent drug offenders to five times more jail time than those convicted of manslaughter.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Marijuana creates pacifism and is a stress reliever 
Will decrease the crime rate if the herb is readily available. It will eliminate the need of an underground subculture 
Marijuana has medicinal values 
No one has ever died from smoking marijuana [unlike the 100,000 people who die every year from alcohol]
Pot enhances creativity</blockquote>
<p>Oh and I don’t know if pot smokers owe tax payers an apology or not after reading this:</p>
<blockquote>According to the FBI, 401,982 Americans were arrested nationwide for marijuana offenses in 1980. By 1999, a record 704,812 were nabbed, 88 percent of them for possession rather than trafficking. Since cannabis arrests constitute 44 percent of all drug apprehensions, the [b]Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) estimates that the government's war on pot smokers costs taxpayers $9.2 billion annually.[/b]</blockquote>
<p>Well I guess I’ll go do something else. I know theres other benefits, and probably some cons.</p>

<p>Anyways atm the dollar is nearing £1-$2 so being realistic ts just under $50 for an eigth, if you dont beleive me your in for a suprise next time you check the stock exchange <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>And to the post above, theres alot of difference between crack and pot, but I see where your getting. If marijuana was legalised it wouldnt set a very good example for hard drug users, soon they will be campaining to leagalise there choice of drug and before you know it everything is out of control.</p>
<p>IRL to Got_Shine (again lol) I agree with you, I dont see the need to mindlessly smoke weed or any other type of drug leading to addiction. It makes som of the more honest tokers look bad. Although we were taught about addiction, which turned out to be another lie (which really is the worst part to lie about) which was you become addicted after your first spliff.</p>
<p>Anyways i look forward to seeing what everyone elses opinion on this is, it always leads to a good discussion lol =)</p>

<p>Yea, what right do they have to tell us we can’t do it? It doesn’t hurt anybody/anything but a few brain cells and alveoli.</p>
<p>But like jme said, I wouldn’t really like it to be legalized, more decriminalized, but it wouldn’t really make a difference for me because here the cops usually just take it away anyways.</p>

              <p>Well at the moment im really pissed off. Im from the west midlands (England) And recently the police are cracking down HARD on weed dealers. Now usually this wouldn’t be a problem, apart from the fact that prices around here have risen from around £15 (about $28, still alot in US terms) for an eigth (3.5 grams) to £25 (About $45) and its hard to get hold off.</p>
<p>Now consider this, we have alot of potheads around here, and dealers are falling short. They cant afford to buy anymore and when they do its hard to obtain because the police have been cracking down, meanwhile harder drugs are alot cheaper and fairly easy to obtain. What are they going to do?</p>
<p>Another thing that really annoys me is the education we get in the U.K over drugs. I can renember throughout my yonger years in secondary and primary school we would have lessons pretty much every week telling us about how bad marijuana is and how easy it is to get addicted. They tell you all the bad facts and lie to you to convince you to avoid the magical herb. Now with all these lies and controvesy lieing in your head, most people will at least try it once, and it makes you think. If its relitivly harmless  and hard to get addicted, what about all the other things the goverment have been trying to make us avoid?</p>
<p>I think at least the youth of today should be told the pro’s and con’s of cannabis, not just lies to make sure we avoid it. Also im looked down upon by society because i smoke it. So what? I know its not good for me but its my life and I make my own choices, just like somebody else may choose to get a tatoo or drink.</p>
<p>Personally im sick of all the crap the goverment have been telling us to avoid something that shouldn’t even take priority over alcohol. If it was legalised and education over drugs was imrpoved to give us the facts not the lies, maybe this country wouldnt be so bad?</p>
<p>I don’t know, what are your opinions?</p>
