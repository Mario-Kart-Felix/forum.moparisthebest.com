              <p>Ok, Make a copy of your client that is connected to your source with the client.java already edited.<br>
Compress it into a .rar file using winrar by right clicking the files and choosing “add to archive”<br>
upload it on a file sharing website and give them the link for the download, it’s that simple.</p>
<p>heres a list of sites i suggest</p>
<p><a href="http://megaupload.com" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://megaupload.com</a><br>
<aside class="onebox whitelistedgeneric">
  <header class="source">

      <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">MediaFire</a>

    <img src="https://www.mediafire.com/images/logos/mf_logo250x250.png" class="thumbnail onebox-avatar" width="250" height="250">

<h3><a href="https://www.mediafire.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">MediaFire</a></h3>

<p>MediaFire is a simple to use free service that lets you put all your photos, documents, music, and video in a single place so you can access them anywhere and share them everywhere.</p>
