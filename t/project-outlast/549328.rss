    <description>[b]Project Outlast[/b]

Project Outlast started as a joke project, but turned into something more. While it&#39;s still a side project, I&#39;d like some help with it. I&#39;m looking for developers, beta testers, and plenty of unique ideas, or criticism.

The base is Project Insanity.

If you&#39;d like to contact me via Skype: highryan1233 or pm me here.

[b]Features[/b]

-Good karma, Bad karma system
-Bad karma has the capability to enslave other players and gain a reward.
-Good karma players gain a reward by slaying those of evil karma and can place a bounty on their head if they want.
-Start out as a slave escape, (first quest) then begin your adventure throughout the world of project outlast.
-Choose your starter and training method. 
-Unique items catered to each karma system.
-Various different quests which have various rewards.
-Certain objectives can only be completed if player has a certain karma.
-Great stability
-Perfected Combat, range, melee, mage.
-Interesting approach to the game, a lot of future potential.
-Lots of different ways to play.
-Revamped many different variants of economy.
-Ingame highscores
-Unique shops buy and sell, barter system. Higher the players barter the more they get for selling and item, less they get the item for.
-Players can repair own equipment such as barrows, vestas with a certain level of repair skills which is linked with smithing.
-Areas are discovered then have the ability to teleport to them.

Looking for content developers asap.

Rofl, with that kind of programming skill, you do.</p>
<p>On a pi you would use:</p>

<p>And you didn’t even finish the application. smh.</p>
