              <p>That is one of the stupidest admins i’ve seen. Why on earth is he giving free items in the first place?</p>
<p>As a server owner, you should be aware of these people’s natures. But anyway, I remember this being on Tree’s BadScapes, so what can you expect?</p>

              <p>Pm’ed you. If you plan on going further with this I think you should re-consider “Kee’s” admin position. Logged in and was given a free purple p hat and d plate (or) and d plate (g). This admin thought he/she was being funny because they didn’t work. So I made up some BS about sending a fake packet to add it to player shops for 1b and the admin started freaking out jailed me, muted me, then ip-banned me while I was posting this. Thought it was pretty funny.</p>
