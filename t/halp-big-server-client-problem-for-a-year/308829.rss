    <title>[HALP!] Big Server/Client problem for a year</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/halp-big-server-client-problem-for-a-year/308829</link>
    <description>GUYS, please I need your help. I beg of it. I have been playing runescape private servers for like 2 years now. Sadly when I started fooling with them and making models it messed it up I guess. Whatever the server or client im on no matter if its someone else&#39;s client from there website. When I click twice in the client it simply closes. It does give me an error message and I do try and look for it. No one seems to know the fix to this problem.

Things I&#39;ve tried:
Google for hours
Redownloading all of JDK and JRE and reinstalling
Getting the new version of JRE
Deleting all Enviromental Variables that consist of Java in my Path and just deleting my Class Path

Im being as descriptive as I can, if you need some other info feel free to ask. This annoyance has cursed me for to long and Im quite tired of it. I really really wanna play some of the private servers that Ive seen advertised that dont have webclients ( I can play webclients btw).

Any info is needed and wanted.</description>

Also you might want to try updating your version of Java. I would also really recommend having the paths set, even if you aren’t going to edit.</p>

              <p>well what i’m thinking is if you really really really wanted to try something that would probably work is go onto your control panel, Click on ‘Users’ and make a new account - then logg of your account and log in on that and download Java if needed and try again. This sould work as I had problems with Clients before until I made a new ‘user’.</p>
<p>Good luck anyway.</p>
