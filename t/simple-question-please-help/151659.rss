    <title>Simple question, Please Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/simple-question-please-help/151659</link>
    <description>Ok I have made my own server succesfully and I was told before to logg into it using the server ip as &quot;[b]localhost[/b]&quot; It loggs in alright and i can do everything normally. Is this the IP I should use everytime I want to logg in? Or should I use my own server Ip. Also other people can&#39;t connect to my server, I know this because I tried logging into my server from my other computer, It wouldn&#39;t logg in. Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

P.S. Sorry if this is a real nooby question, This is the first server I have made.</description>

              <p>I think you need to Port Forward, check the Tutorials Section, under that stickied topic “How to make a server - to stop the questions”.</p>
