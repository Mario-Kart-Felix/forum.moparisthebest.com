    <meta name="description" content="Idk, i think atm, rep is just bullshit. Some people with 200 don&amp;#39;t deserve it, and others with 200 got it a long time ago, when it was easy to get.

<p>Vets can still be nominated and rep will help them choose wisely for the next nomination, because rep will be more valuable then.

<p>Actually Mr. new here, rep was alot more difficult to get back when me and others got it.

<p>Half of us don’t even check these forums.</p>
<p>Edit: and even if I did, I would probably not rep anyone. The last positive rep I gave out was in '07, then the one before that is in '06.</p>

When vets first came out they were coming in slowly, and then no one cared anymore because there wasn’t really any benefit to becoming one. If we got a handful of active people on these forums to become the new base vets it would probably roll along well.</p>
<p>Would you care a little more knowing that when you repped someone, you were one of the few that could actually do it? Making it more valuable to the receiver?</p>

When was the last time a new vet was added?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I think the last one to be added was me, and that was months and months ago.[/quote]<br>
My point exactly.</p>
<p>Due to poor choice of the base vet community, it crawled and died in less than a year.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Frell, post:19, topic:336655”]It needs to be reset and only vets should be allowed to rep. The position for vet will become more popular and wanted, and as the vets act like spies for good work people will be helping left and right.</p>
<p>Vets can still be nominated and rep will help them choose wisely for the next nomination, because rep will be more valuable then. If they see someone with 50 rep, they’ve only been repped by vets which means they probably did something good to deserve it, and they could become a potential nomination.</p>
<p>Any vet that is caught abusing rep will have their rep reset and blacklisted from ever becoming a veteran again.</p>
<p>Simple as.</p>
<p>Actually Mr. new here, rep was alot more difficult to get back when me and others got it. There was a thing called Moparscape CM, and anyone who got 50 rep became one by messaging an admin/GM. 50 rep slowly became so easy to get it was changed to vets, rendering the reputation system completely useless on this site.[/quote]</p>
<p>This could work, worth a try.</p>

Its pointless. The forum went 2-3 years of no rep cap and then it was finally added. It needs to be reset and have a new system or its pointless.</p>
<p>If we aren’t going to try to fix it we might aswell remove it. Its meant to show how helpful someone can be, but when the system is anarchy it doesn’t mean shit.</p>
<p>It wasn’t supposed to be -1 at first, it was going to be – as much as you would ++, but it would have been abused way to much.</p>

Vets and vets only. And didn’t you read where i said we need a knew batch of vets?</p>
<p>Repping only at 50 wont do anything but slow it down for about a week. And then it would go back to being useless. Seeing someones rep at 50 and knowing they got it from the best in the community means that they’re good for something.</p>
<p>And since nominations are required people cant make their friends vets for no reason.</p>
<p>With my system idea, rep will basically show your contributions to the community.</p>
<p>Even if no one will race for rep it will be just as useless.</p>

        <p>Vets should be the only ones to give out rep, as they’ve been around long enough to know what deserves it. With this set though, it would be a good idea to reset the reputation, because when new members come they’ll be looking at everyone with 200 rep while they have to get it the hard way.</p>

<p>All rep is just +1, doesn’t go up as yours does</p>

<p>Rep reset of everyone besides veterans and community members</p>

<li>
<p>add report abuse for rep (And if rep abuse is abused, ur rep is reset), When reported u keep the rep but the abuser gets -1, -5, or reset depending on abuse.</p>
</li>

<p>Rep should be very harsh and only for the members that absolutely deserve it. When you receive rep you should feel honored that someone took the time to recognize you.</p>
<p>Change is not easy, but it is always possible.</p>
