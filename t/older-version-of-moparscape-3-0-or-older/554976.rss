    <title>Older version of Moparscape (3.0 or older)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/older-version-of-moparscape-3-0-or-older/554976</link>
    <description>Does anyone have a copy of an older Moparscape?
I just tried the 3.2 and it is not working.  Closes after 2 seconds on trying to download the cache files.

If anyone can help out I would appreciate it.

thanks!</description>

<p>EDIT:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">SOLVED!!!</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><br>
tl;dr:</span> It’s missing the cache files and the auto loader won’t fetch it.</p>
<p>[ol][li]Download here: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/cache/cache.zip" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/cache/cache.zip</a><br>
[/li][li]Extract the contents of the zip in its entirety to the following directory: C:.mpr_file_store_32 (Accept any overwrites)<br>
[/li][li]Start the game with either the .jar or .bat<br>
[/li][/ol]</p>
<p>Long version:</p>
<p>I decided to use GeForces built-in ShadowPlay, which captures the last 5 minutes of desktop activity. I opened the recording in VLC media player and went frame by frame the second or two that the client was open to view the write output command prompt of the client. It looked to me that it was attempting to load a cache.zip file from a location on the net, and that’s where the client terminated. So, I searched “cache” in the Moparscape download megathread. Sure enough, others were having the same issue, and I also came across the download link for the cache. After downloading the zip, I extracted the contents to the mpr file storage location, and sure enough it worked.</p>
<p>Please share this with anyone trying to play moparscape from now on!</p>
