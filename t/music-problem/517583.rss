    <title>Music problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/music-problem/517583</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve got everything needed for playing music in game but I messed up the logic some how?


The problem is that music does not always stop playing and sometimes it overlaps (2+ tracks playing at once). The problem is not related to my Music class.

Here&#39;s the method:
[code=java]	

	public boolean canPlay = true; 
	public boolean playing = false; 

	public void music() {
		Music edgevil = new Music(new File(&quot;music/dream.mid&quot;));
		Music pest = new Music(new File(&quot;music/pest-control-game.mid&quot;));
		try {
			if (edgevil() &amp;&amp; canPlay) { //if in edgevil and music player is on
				if (playing == false) { //if there is no track currently playing
					edgevil.start(); //start new track
					
					playing = true; //tells client music is playing
					System.out.println(&quot;Playing track for edgevil!&quot;); //tells us music is playing
					
					Thread.sleep(2000); //delay till next action
					edgevil.stop(); //stop the track
					playing = false; //no music is playing
				}
				
			} else if (pestControl() &amp;&amp; canPlay) { //if in pestcontrol and music player is on	
				if (playing == false) { //if there is nothing playing
					pest.start(); //start new track
					
					playing = true; //tell client music is playing
					System.out.println(&quot;Playing track for pest control!&quot;); //tell us music is playing
					
					Thread.sleep(2000); //delay till next action
					pest.stop(); //stop the track
					playing = false; //tell client nothing is playing
				}
			} else if (playing = true) { //if music is playing 
				System.out.println(&quot;Music  is already playing!&quot;); //tells us music is playing
			} else if (playing = false) { //if music is not playing
				music.stop(); //making sure the music has stopped!
			} else { //otherwise
				playing = false; //no music playing
				System.out.println(&quot;You are in an unknown region!&quot;); //debug
			}
		} catch (Exception e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}

[/code]

The notes could be wrong also.</description>

<p>Thnx already covered dat<br>
[hr]<br>
If the songs are overlapping it is because of how the thread is designed. It is structured something like this</p>
<p>while thread != nil {<br>
while song isn’t finished {<br>
read song and write to output<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p>So even though you set the thread to null, it is designed to let the song fully finish playing before it terminates.</p>
