    <description>Code:
&#39;javac&#39; is not recognised as a internal or external command
Answer: This means that you have not installed java. You have to go to www.java.com and at the top, click Download Now. Then you wil be able to run your server and compile it.

It says &#39;javac&#39; is not recognised as a internal or external command when I run my compiler, but I can run the server fine. Its been up for days, and I want to be able to edit a little more than the shops... How can I get the compiler to work does anybody know?

I have Java, i&#39;ve tried multiple versions of JDK, I just don&#39;t know what to do now.. Giving up trying to get it myself, i need help. :/</description>

<p>To get rid of your compiler problems forever just get Mod Taharock’s “perfect” compiler from his ultimate server guide.</p>

              <p>Switch your paths correctly to your installed JDK type. N’ your wrong on the answer, it doesn’t mean you have not installed java, javac means it is telling java to compile that file, but cannot because paths are not specified correctly.</p>
