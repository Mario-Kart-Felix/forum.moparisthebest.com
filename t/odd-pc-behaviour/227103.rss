    <title>Odd pc behaviour</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/odd-pc-behaviour/227103</link>
    <description>Well, when trying to install a game as AA or Rappelz my pc starts to act funny. Those installers, like any other installer on vista need admin privileges. But I don&#39;t get a popup while installing it, so it cancels the installation because it can&#39;t access files. So I run the installer as admin (right click) but then all I get is the vista version of the sand glass, and it stays like that all the time. I can move the mouse, but I can&#39;t use windows explorer anymore unless I close it via task manager. When I put the installer on my desktop, the same happens but then I can&#39;t use my desktop anymore. The only way to somehow get it back working is clicking on that desktop button next to start. When I shut my pc down, it stays at the &quot;shutting down windows&quot; screen. What is wrong?

Thanks in advance.

Edit: Fixt! Disabling UAC did the job.</description>
