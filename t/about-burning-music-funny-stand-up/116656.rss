    <title>About burning music/funny stand up</title>

    <description>Yeha this is a useless post since most people here dont give a shit about the law but whatever.  I was watching some guy doing stand up(maybe on last comic standing?)and he said  &quot;you have all seen those commercials.  ya know that say you wouldnt steal a purse, you wouldnt steal a car, so why would u steal music.  Well, if my friend said &#39;i just got a new car, want me to BURN you a copy&#39; I would say hell ya!&quot;
