[b][u]Story Line - SUBJECT TO CHANGE[/u][/b]
You awaken, not knowing where or who you are. A man nearby introduces himself as ____ and initiates a conversation with you,you find out that your people have abandoned you, after beating you senseless. He tells you your name, and says that thats all he knows about you.

After your conversation with ____, you are free to wonder about the small village, and talk to the people that live there.
You realize, you have the chance to re invent your entire life. Want to become a hero? Try slaying the King black dragon, or any of the other fearsome creatures that terrorize the world of Gielinor. Fancy the quiet life? Try your hand at being a craftsman, a lumberjack or even a fisherman.
Someone annoying you? or do you just feel like some warfare? Enter the wilderness and fight to the death!

They aren’t humans, lol. THey have different features, etc. More stocky, bit uglier. But stronger.</p>
<p>IDC if people play or not. If i get a full storyline done, I’ll turn this into a game.</p>

You awaken, not knowing where or who you are. A man nearby introduces himself as ____ and initiates a conversation with you,you find out that your people have abandoned you, after beating you senseless. He tells you your name, and says that thats all he knows about you.</p>
<p>After your conversation with ____, you are free to wonder about the small village, and talk to the people that live there.<br>
You realize, you have the chance to re invent your entire life. Want to become a hero? Try slaying the King black dragon, or any of the other fearsome creatures that terrorize the world of Gielinor. Fancy the quiet life? Try your hand at being a craftsman, a lumberjack or even a fisherman.<br>
Someone annoying you? or do you just feel like some warfare? Enter the wilderness and fight to the death!</p>
