    <title>[DELTA] Adding Custom Emotes and Animations</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-adding-custom-emotes-and-animations/469989</link>
    <description>I need help adding custom animations (that are to be used for emotes in a client I&#39;m working on). I&#39;ve got a non-renamed 317 Delta client. I have an animation already, custom-made, in .dat format, located in an anims folder in the Cache folder. I&#39;ve been looking around, and I see the class files that need to be edited are class18, class20, class30_sub2_sub2, and class36, but I just don&#39;t know how or where to begin adding material. (Or what material to begin WITH, even)

I&#39;ve heard of an alternate method, which involves adding the animation into the cache, but I don&#39;t know how to go about doing that. 

So, I&#39;m requesting some noob-friendly assistance with animations. Help please? c:</description>
