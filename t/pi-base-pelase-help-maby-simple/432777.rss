How much threads have you made over the last week?</p>
<p>You have compiled after you changed coords. And not everything is in config.java. Look at your minigame folders and search for the coords in there and change them. Or in client.java or any other file. It’s easy as that.</p>
<p>For the duel arena u have to add it that when you win you will teleport out. It’s not added yet.[/quote]</p>
<p>what can i do if i need help lol?</p>
