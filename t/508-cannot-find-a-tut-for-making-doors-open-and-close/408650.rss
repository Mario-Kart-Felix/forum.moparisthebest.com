    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-cannot-find-a-tut-for-making-doors-open-and-close/408650</link>
    <description>Okay so I have been using mithscape deleted a lot of junk from it and trying to just get the basics of doing stuff so i have open the file.

Object1Option1

Which contains my doors (Bandos boss and armadly Boss Doors)

I have found them in the folder i just want to add a new home but its inside a castle so i need to learn how to open doors to get inside.

Its a mithscape palidino76 base.

EDIT: IF anyone knows how to delete doors then that is fine i have added the stuff in but cannot find the objects id&#39;s.

Its in lumbridge castle the large doors that go into the eating hall



Help is very appreciated Thanks</description>
