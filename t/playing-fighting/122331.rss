    <description>I would really like to know how to make a player face who he/she is fighting, same goes for npc/player that is fighting back, When I range i face the opposite dirrection from whom im attacking.

&amp; where to change max hits , I looked at calculateMaxHit(); it&#39;s pretty basic, Somthing about a str bonus = 10 and that&#39;s it, I mean runescape bases max hits off pots, lvls, prayer, weapon types and whatnot? What is a good formula for it.</description>
