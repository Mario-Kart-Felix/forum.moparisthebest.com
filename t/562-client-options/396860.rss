    <title>562 client options?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-client-options/396860</link>
    <description>How do you make an option bar on a 562 client? As in like how it has Options Like - File | Ip | Port | Etc.
How can I add that? Also on my client title page I have like Members and non members. They both go to the same world but I would like to make the members login only available to donation and I also want the full screen feature only available to people who go on the members login.</description>
