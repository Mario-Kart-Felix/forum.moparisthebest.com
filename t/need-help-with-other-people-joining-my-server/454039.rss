    <title>Need help with other people joining my server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-other-people-joining-my-server/454039</link>
    <description>I have everything set up with no-ip and followed all the steps. I even set the IP address in the client to be my ip, but I don&#39;t know how I can give it to my friends to get them to connect. I am trying on moparscape to connect to my server, but it won&#39;t do it. I even went to rswebclients website status checker and checked my server and it said it was online. Can I get some help please? :)</description>
