    <description>[b]This is usually the steps I take when I start on a minecraft world ;) follow them if you wish
[/b]

[ul][li]When you spawn what I like to do is stay on the respawn tile and scan my new world for possible location of my new home. I stay on the respawn tile because I like to be able to see my home so when/if I die you can still navigate to it. The location I choose by preference must have 1 tree onto the way of it, and be situated on a hill and near a river (I like to build moats...). [/li]
	[li]Once I have chosen my location I then like to make my way towards it collecting resources on the way. I always try to collect sand and wood and those little miniature trees that you can collect from chopping trees.[/li]
	[li]Now when I get to my home location I will plant those tree things around 20 squares away from my entrance of my home, and then I use the wood I collected to make a workbench and 1 wooden pickaxe.[/li]
	[li]I then dig a entrance for my home which will be 3 squares high &amp; 2-3 squares wide. Then i will keep digging into the cave until I&#39;m happy.[/li]
	[li]Once I&#39;m happy with my little home I have accumulated a fair bit of cobblestone &amp; mud and actually coal. I then will use the coal and refined wood to make torches and illuminate my home up ;D [/li]
	[li]It is usually dark by now so I will start mining into the floor in search of coal, iron, gold diamond and red dust or something? I will dig until it becomes light and then I will depending on what I find either create weapons or go outside to where i planted my trees and harvest them and replant them.[/li]
	[li]Now I will create a furnace and start creating glass blocks and making sky lights in my home to make it seem nicer.[/li][/ul]
I will continue this tomorrow after school maybe? And I will add images

[b]Here are some useful links if you are following what I do[/b]

<p>Just a quick suggestion though:</p>
<p>You say that you stay on the respawn tile because you like to be able to see your home so when/if you die you can still navigate to it?</p>
<p>There’s a command you can use to navigate back to your home wherever you are (Which is also handy if you get caught out at night surrounded by annoying zombies), it’s the /sethome command. You can set your home when you’re in a safe place and then teleport back to that square using /home.</p>
<p>Hope that helps :D[/quote]<br>
It’s about singleplayer, not multiplayer lol</p>
