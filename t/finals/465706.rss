    <description>Even though the title may be misleading, I figured I would share this story.

Here lately, I have been doing lousy in school, not caring about my work. My mom received my progress report about 6 weeks ago and she was disappointed. Later on that day, she made me a deal. If I got all A&#39;s (Not A-&#39;s) she would award me with $80.

Have your parents ever done anything such as this?</description>

              <p>Bowser: So true. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Everyone at my school in honors pretty much expects an A, except there is one class who everyone says is SO HARD. The reason being is the teacher is extremely anal and she doesn’t have a single multiple choice test, besides the final. I believe the final has to be multiple choice since it is like standardized testing. She has all these rules too to knock off points. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Like you have to write in standard manuscript, circle box or underline your answer, if there is a multiple choice question you have to circle the whole answer not the letter or else it is wrong, you have to write your full name not your nickname, and many more. I remember one test in particular I got the question wrong because I wrote lanthanide series instead of lanthanides series.</p>
<p>On the other hand you have basically every other class besides math (and even sometimes math) that uses multiple choice. English may have some short answer, but that is about it. You can almost guarantee yourself a C on a multiple choice test if you are good at looking for what is in common with the choices. I always look for one answer that sticks out because only one answer can be correct and the other ones are different.</p>
<p>Sorry for that little rant. I just am finishing up 5 hours of homework in one night because of that aforementioned teacher and because I’m a procrastinator. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

Well my dad made a deal with me, i got straight A’s on my first report card sophomore year and he said if I continued to get straight A’s for the rest of the year and the two years after that I would get a new car of my choice. I did it (Graduated with a GPA of 4.2 and as 2nd Validictorian) and my dad bought me a new 2011 Nissan Maxima (33k), It actually worked out pretty nice, I go to a great school now with a nice car <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
[/quote]so he went out and bought you a crappy car &lt;3<br>
[/quote]Think of it as an added bonus, I really didn’t do it for that car but It was like that extra push that was always there when I got lazy or slacked off, plus I have to pay $700 a year for parking, gas is freaking expensive, general maintenance, and the bills just rack up. If anything its really not worth all that trouble and the car will probably be sitting at my parents for the next couple years lol. Either way, that bet kinda set my life into perspective and the more I think about, it really wasn’t about the car and if anything, it was my dad looking out for me &lt;3[/quote]</p>
<p>pfft $700 for parking a year, I think you’d have a heart attack over here in England, I’m 20 and the cheapest insurance I found for a cheap car to insure was about $3200 a year [/quote]<br>
That’s freaking expensive lol, I’m glad we have a ton of insurance companies which are waaaay cheaper, I pay roughly $1200 a year for insurance and its going down since I don’t drive around that much plus no tickets/accidents/citations so far.</p>
<p>[quote=“Acorn_, post:35, topic:465706”]I would recommend touching a dogs nose for a while, did that once for like 45 minutes straight once<br>

<p>My point is that there is something wrong with parents expecting straight A’s, when the requirements should be high enough that you have to make an real effort.</p>
<p>My point about multiple choice quizzes is that you only need to learn to recognize the answer. Getting A’s on them isn’t hard.</p>

No, and I have still not opened the letter with my high school grades. It is pretty safe to promise someone money if they only get top grades, as it is close to impossible to achieve in a proper school system.<br>

^ That sums up my school perfectly.<br>
-Homework isn’t a grade<br>
-We’re on a number scale for grading (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)[/quote]<br>
Sums it up in what way? That you aren’t suppose to get only top grades?</p>
