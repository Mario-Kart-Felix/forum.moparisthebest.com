    <title>Anyone have Dark Quest source with the cool Gui?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-have-dark-quest-source-with-the-cool-gui/388392</link>
    <description>I have been searching for this source for over two years for the cool GUI. I&#39;m not sure who owns it or if it is related to the dark quest that was before rsca. Here&#39;s some vids:

I may be willing to offer cash (if thats legal on this forum) for the source if the real owner would come forward with a working or close to working source.</description>

I guess I could take that, although we must all take into account that I’m bot actively deving  rsc everyday. Just for fun. Thanks for the advice. And about Luke, I like most people don’t have a problem with him. Although if he could be nicer I think people would respect him more.</p>

Read the sig. “code stuff for my sever” The gui would go in the client. (you would know that won’t you?) Also making the GUI isn’t as easy as coping a pasting (because of course it wouldn’t be in the original rsc client)</p>

Maybe you are right. It’s just moving stuff around. The spell book would be pretty hard though.</p>

              <p>I have been searching for this source for over two years for the cool GUI. I’m not sure who owns it or if it is related to the dark quest that was before rsca. Here’s some vids:</p>
<p><div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="7Xruh_h5y5Q" data-youtube-title="DarkQuest - Runescape Classic Online" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div><br>
<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="9YUwSa8Ypdg" data-youtube-title="RuneScape Classic (Dark Quest) presented by National Guard of Runescape" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div></p>
<p>I may be willing to offer cash (if thats legal on this forum) for the source if the real owner would come forward with a working or close to working source.</p>
