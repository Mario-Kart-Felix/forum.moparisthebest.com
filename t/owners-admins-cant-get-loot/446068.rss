              <p>i bet you admins cant trade or drop either…</p>
<p>i believe this is added to prevent admins from helping the players… e.g an admin will come and kill a boss then leaves it for another player to get… i think this is a good feature actually and u shouldnt remove…<br>
after all why do u want to get loot off players anyways… prevents hacking too</p>
