    <title>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</title>

    <description>[b]What is Kingdom Come?[/b]
Kingdom Come is an RPG currently in development by Warhorse that is set in 15th century Europe. The goal by the designers is to create an incredibly realistic experience, where the things you do effect how the world around you interacts. There is a primary story that may be followed, or the player can choose to follow their own quest as they explore the 3.5 sq. mile region filled with villages, forests, dungeons, and castles.

[b]How did this come about?[/b]
While the developers were initially having funding issues, they started a kickstarter project on a final whim. In about a month, they managed to raise over 1.8m USD. Since then, they have been working hard to make this game a reality.

[b]When will this be coming out?[/b]
Work in progress. Various projections estimate 2015.

This looks like it&#39;s going to be an incredible game once released. If you go on the website and watch videos they have about development, you&#39;ll join me in high hopes for the combat system.</description>
