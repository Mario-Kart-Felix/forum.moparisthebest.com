    <title>[req] Client source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-client-source/16677</link>
    <description>Hey, I need AS MANY client sources as I can get, I&#39;m trying to do an experiment with something but seems like I can&#39;t just look into sources at the moment.

Prefered if you included all the compiled files, and java files in 1 folder, and a .jar file (if you have one) in another.

I need them all to be clean, I should only need about 2.. If you want anything in return which I can give, I&#39;ll be more than happy to for helping me out :)


just thought about it: If you&#39;re saying im going to leach it, i won&#39;t. I think I have done enough around here to prove I&#39;m here to learn, rather than to waste my time stealing stuff &gt;_&lt;   (pm me the link(s) to avoid leaching noobs)</description>
