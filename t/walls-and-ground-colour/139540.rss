    <description>* i also posted this in the questions section, but no one answered.. *

hey everyone,

I have been searching for a long time and had no luck. so i decided to make a thread. I want to know if it is possible to add walls and ground colour the same way you would as if it was a global object. so for instance, i could make a bank in the wildy with a stone coloured floor.

If it is possible, could you please either give me a link to a tutorial or explain it in a post. I would also like to know whether it is server or client sided..

Thanks in advance.  Wink</description>

              <p>well it is doable but the thing is that there is a way you can make a bank it is like a water downed form of constriction and it you can use parts of other banks to build it but it woulnt fit perfect unless you like use all the objects from one bank like make vorock bank in wildy its possable.</p>
