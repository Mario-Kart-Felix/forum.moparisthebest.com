<p>tl;dw - This system works directly with the game publisher to not only allow people to use their assets to create mods, but the publisher gets a cut of the profit that steam takes from mod sales. This is why the trial is just for skyrim, Bethesda was the first company they worked out a contract with</p>

Eh. I myself actually have a couple of Garry’s Mod workshop weapons, would I like to make money off them? Of course, who doesn’t like making money, however, would I want to be the other user having to pay for workshop addons in a game that I also payed money for? No. I would not. It would also probably take me down from the like 20k downloads I got to around a couple ten… Maybe it will work good in certain games, like Skyrim, the original version. I’m partial because when I think of workshop, the first thing that comes to mind is Gmod, which paid workshop items spell danger for the entire community of it, with all the kids running around making half assed items and making money for it, wouldn’t even be able to download these things for more then 24 hours and laugh and the glitches with your friends…</p>
