    <title>America becoming a 3rd world country?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/america-becoming-a-3rd-world-country/301082</link>
    <description>Well, a lot with the economy being down. I&#39;ve been thinking a lot of everything. Do you think that America is going to become a 3rd world country? I know it hasn&#39;t yet, but in future terms, will it? I&#39;ve even contemplated moving to Canada (so help me God).

Discuss I guess?</description>

<p>You can say what you want, in the end the President is responsible for what his government does. I don’t know how strict they are about that in the US, but in the Netherlands a government can fall because one minister does a bad job. I think the same can happen in the US; if the President decides to give money to a state for a specific cause, the money should be used for that. If it doesn’t, the governor should be fired. If that doesn’t happen, the President is to blame.</p>

<p>Yea, a hard ass Capitalist country, that for some reason always thought that they should fight Communism in countries that are none of their business, suddenly becomes Communist itself.</p>
<p>This is what’s going to happen: Obama finishes this administrative period, and then he gets reelected. Only this time, he wins with a smaller advantage. After that period, another Republican wins the elections, and so on. The following 8 years socialist bills will pass, and after these 8 years Republicans will get rid of them again.</p>
