              <p>[quote=“MrFun, post:5, topic:444333”]1. i guess the gameframe is over-used<br>
2. i put my name there cause it came with my blank client and source<br>
3. yea client background is poorly done didn’t really do any real editing<br>
4. i was planing to work and add a extra crown for owner<br>
5. Now i believe names are just for my liking and will change when finish if i get more hate comments<br>
6. i think this one is a great comment?<br>
7. have no clue what you mean<br>
8. what are “orbs” you are taking about?<br>
9. thanks for this comment<br>
10. thanks for this comment<br>
11. well i just did alot of custom items, commands, small graphics, fixing skills, changing stance, adding new training grounds, and adding shops and other thinks<br>
12. yea i don’t know how to put 2h items like 2hs’ and godswords where a shield won’t equip<br>
13. can you explain my grammar doings?<br>
14. I believe teleport commands are in every private server so don’t they must be there?<br>
15. well i was going to change my starting training zone to some where else when I get done with other stuff<br>
16. what you mean wrong gfx on ancient teleport?<br>
17. this is a 317 client and source<br>
18. this is a progress not a full finish server…I only found the spot and now adding shops<br>
19. well i really don’t know how to clean it up there’s not alot of tuts that tell you in full and simple way<br>
20. well i’m srry but i don’t really like the mini-games alot of high rated ps have it on the hills.<br>
21. go idea, yet i don’t know how to make it infinite<br>
22. thanks that 120 stuff is still in a toss up i don’t know if i like it either<br>
23. i have to commands for energy because my is just refill and another is for mods and admins for infinite. again don’t know how to make infinity run<br>
24. have no clue what you mean<br>
25. yea was planing to</p>
<p>well thanks for your tips will come soon[/quote]</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>You’re right, I just think it’s a wee-bit lacking.</li>
<li>No, it means they’re awful to look at. Especially the wings… Their inventory models are just squares… &amp;&amp; They’re un-animated.</li>
<li>You have items from the new era of RS (602+) and you’re using older character models and a 474~ (kind of) gameframe. I’m saying pick one style and stick with it through and through.</li>
<li>Orbs are: hitpoints/prayer/energy/summoning, none of them show the correct text.</li>
<li>Plenty of tutorials on that.</li>
<li>When You Click The Crystal Chest It Spams The Chatbox With A Sentence Like This.</li>
<li>Again, personal choice, I however don’t think it’s a good idea to have <span class="bbcode-b">that</span> many commands because it’s rather hard to keep track of and use readily for your players.</li>
<li>You’re supposed to have a purple block encase the player, instead you have a ring around them… It’s just the wrong gfx.</li>
<li>What does the revision for source/client have to do with your hitpoints? It said the man had 100 HP and you hit 7 and it died. That should not happen.</li>
<li>There are javadocs everywhere regarding conventions.</li>
<li>Remove the method(s) that have draining, just delete it and fix any errors that arise because of doing so.</li>
<li>Conventions for naming, spacing, etc. Also you have so much garbage in your Client class. You can break it up into multiple other classes and even convert most of that stuff to use a tick/event manager.</li>
</ol>
<p>I admire the way you took the criticism, I have faith that you’ll be a great PS owner.</p>

<p>[ul][li]Change that gameframe, it’s over-used and quite hideous.[/li]<br>
[li]Your name in the bottom-left hand corner is distracting.[/li]<br>
[li]The client background and login box are poorly done.[/li]<br>

[li]FunScape is a bad name to use imo.[/li]<br>
[li]The custom items make my eyes bleed.[/li]<br>
[li]Pick one revision and stick with it.[/li]<br>
[li]None of your orbs are working properly.[/li]<br>
[li]All of the custom sprites are atrocious, except that logout door. I really do like that one.[/li]<br>
[li]Remove that pink text crap, change it back to yellow or at least allow the users to choose.[/li]<br>
[li]Within the first four minutes the only update you showed was you moving npcs for shops… Which isn’t an update.[/li]<br>
[li]Dragon kiteshield and primal 2h were equipped at the same time.[/li]<br>
[li]Fix up the grammar on your server.[/li]<br>
[li]Stay away from commands for teleportation…[/li]<br>
[li]Your training area is something from mid 2006 or 2007. Add some variation. Why would you use the duel arena of all places? Now you can’t have duel tournaments… 1,000 coins per drop from men is a lot, you’re not going to have an economy.[/li]<br>
[li]The wrong gfx played when you used ancients teleport.[/li]<br>
[li]You hit a 7 on a man with 100hp and it died.[/li]<br>
[li]What features of donator exc are there? You failed to show any.[/li]<br>
[li]Even your player commands are crammed in the Client class? That’s ridiculous, clean that crap up.[/li]<br>
[li]Make a real barrows mini-game, there’s no excuse for putting them on a hill anymore.[/li]<br>
[li]If you’re going to make a command to let players refill their energy just remove draining in the first place.[/li]<br>
[li]Level 120 skills…? I’m not a fan.[/li]<br>
[li]Why do you have two commands for energy? If you really don’t care if the players can have energy whenever, just remove it…[/li]<br>
[li]Conventions in your Client class are God awful, do work on that too.[/li]<br>
[li]Make a PK Points shop instead of having them use commands.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>You could have shown us all of that in a much, much shorter video and also do not type “brb” while you’re recording, if you do happen to have to leave at least pause the video.</p>
<p>Other then that, good job.[/quote]</p>
