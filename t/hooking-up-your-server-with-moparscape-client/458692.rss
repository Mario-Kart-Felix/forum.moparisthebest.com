    <title>Hooking up your server with moparscape client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hooking-up-your-server-with-moparscape-client/458692</link>
    <description>hey, so i really want to hook up my f2p server with the moparscape client. like i want to play my server in the moparscape client. however i have not portforwarded yet. i was under the impression that i can play on the client, without port forwarding, as long it is only me playing. can someone tell me how, or give me a link to a tut that tells how to hook up your server with the moparscape client? 
thank you.</description>
