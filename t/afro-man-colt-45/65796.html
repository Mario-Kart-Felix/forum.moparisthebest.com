<p><strong>Sings</strong><br>
Colt 45 and two zig-zags<br>
Baby that’s all we need<br>
We go to far at the dogs.<br>
Smoke that pound of weed<br>
As the marijuana burn<br>
we can take our turn<br>
singin’ them dirty rap songs<br>
stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong<br>
and sell tapes from here to hong kong<br>
i said roll, roll, roll my joint<br>
pick out the seeds and stems,<br>
feelin’ high as hell<br>
flyin’ through palm dale<br>
skatin’ on dayton wheels<br>
so roll, roll, the '83<br>
cadillac coupe de ville<br>
if my tapes and cd’s just don’t sell<br>
i bet my cabby will</p>
<p>well it was just sun down<br>
in a small white town<br>
and they call it east side palm down<br>
when the afroman walked through the white land<br>
houses went up for sale<br>
well i was standin’ on the corner sellin’ rap CD’s<br>
when i met a lil’ girl named Jan<br>
i let her ride in my caddy<br>
‘cause i didn’t know her daddy<br>
was the leader of the ku-klux-klan<br>
we fucked on the bed<br>
fucked on the floor<br>
fucked so long<br>
i grew a fuckin’ afro<br>
then i fucked to the left<br>

she sucked my dick<br>
til the shit turned white<br>
i thought to myself<br>
“sheeba, sheeba!”<br>
got my ass lookin’ like a zebra<br>
i put on my clothes<br>
and i was on my way<br>
till her daddy pulled up in a chevorlet<br>
so i ran, jumped out the back window<br>
but her daddy he was waitin’ with a 2 by 4<br>

<p>Colt 45 and two zig-zags<br>
Baby that’s all we need<br>
We can go to the door at the dogs<br>

As the marijuana burn<br>
we can take our turn<br>
singin’ them dirty rap songs<br>
stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong<br>
i said it takes form him to hong kong<br>
i said roll, roll, roll my joint<br>
pick out the seeds and stems<br>
feelin’ high as hell<br>
flyin’ through palm bell<br>
skatin’ on dragon wheels<br>
so roll, roll, roll the '83<br>
cadillac coupe de ville<br>
if my tapes and cd’s just don’t sell<br>
i bet my cabby will</p>
<p>i met this lady in Hollywood<br>
she had green hair but damn she look good<br>
i took her to my house 'cause she looked fine<br>
but she whooped out a dick that was bigger than mine<br>
i met this lady from Japan<br>
never made love with an african<br>
i fucked her once, i fucked her twice<br>
i ate that pussy like shrimp-fried rice<br>
don’t be amazed at the stories i tell you<br>
i met a woman in the heart of Australia<br>
she had a big butt and titties too<br>
so i hopped in her ass like a kangaroo<br>
see i met this woman from Hawaii<br>
stuck it in her ass and she said “iiiiiiiiieeeeee”<br>
lips was breakfast<br>
pussy was lunch<br>
then her titties busted open with hawaiian punch<br>
met Colonel Sanders wife<br>
in the state of Kentucky<br>
she said i’ll fry some chicken<br>
if you just fuck me<br>
i came in her mouth it was a crisis<br>
i gave her my secret blend<br>
of herbs and spices</p>
<p>Colt 45 and two zig-zags<br>
Baby that’s all we need<br>
We can go to the door at the dogs<br>
Smoke that tumbleweed<br>
As the marijuana burn<br>
we can take our turn<br>
singin’ them dirty rap songs<br>
