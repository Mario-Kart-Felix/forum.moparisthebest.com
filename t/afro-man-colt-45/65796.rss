There was this blind man right.

with his stick right.

he stoped he took a deep breath.
he said Whoa! Good morning ladies.

You like that shit man?
I got a gang of that shit man.
I&#39;ll tell you what
My man on the guitar
Dude on the drums
Everyody gather &#39;round the mic
I&#39;ll tell ya all these muthaf**kas
First I&#39;mma start it off like this
Help me sing it homeboy!
C&#39;mon!

**Sings**
Colt 45 and two zig-zags
Baby that&#39;s all we need
We go to far at the dogs.
Smoke that pound of weed
As the marijuana burn
we can take our turn
singin&#39; them dirty rap songs
stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong
and sell tapes from here to hong kong
i said roll, roll, roll my joint
pick out the seeds and stems,
feelin&#39; high as hell
flyin&#39; through palm dale
skatin&#39; on dayton wheels
so roll, roll, the &#39;83
cadillac coupe de ville
if my tapes and cd&#39;s just don&#39;t sell
i bet my cabby will

well it was just sun down
in a small white town
and they call it east side palm down
when the afroman walked through the white land
houses went up for sale
well i was standin&#39; on the corner sellin&#39; rap CD&#39;s
when i met a lil&#39; girl named Jan
i let her ride in my caddy
&#39;cause i didn&#39;t know her daddy
was the leader of the ku-klux-klan
we fucked on the bed
fucked on the floor
fucked so long
i grew a fuckin&#39; afro
then i fucked to the left
fucked to the right
she sucked my dick
til the shit turned white
i thought to myself
&quot;sheeba, sheeba!&quot;
got my ass lookin&#39; like a zebra
i put on my clothes
and i was on my way
till her daddy pulled up in a chevorlet
so i ran, jumped out the back window
but her daddy he was waitin&#39; with a 2 by 4
oh he beat me to the left
beat me to the right
the mothafucka whooped my as all night
but i ain&#39;t mad
at her prejudice dad
that&#39;s the best damn pussy i eva had
i got a bag of weed
and a bottle of wine
i&#39;m gonna fuck that bitch
just one more time

Colt 45 and two zig-zags
Baby that&#39;s all we need
We can go to the door at the dogs
Smoke that tumbleweed
As the marijuana burn
we can take our turn
singin&#39; them dirty rap songs
stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong
i said it takes form him to hong kong
i said roll, roll, roll my joint
pick out the seeds and stems
feelin&#39; high as hell
flyin&#39; through palm bell
skatin&#39; on dragon wheels
so roll, roll, roll the &#39;83
cadillac coupe de ville
if my tapes and cd&#39;s just don&#39;t sell
i bet my cabby will

i met this lady in Hollywood
she had green hair but damn she look good
i took her to my house &#39;cause she looked fine
but she whooped out a dick that was bigger than mine
i met this lady from Japan
never made love with an african
i fucked her once, i fucked her twice
i ate that pussy like shrimp-fried rice
don&#39;t be amazed at the stories i tell you
i met a woman in the heart of Australia
she had a big butt and titties too
so i hopped in her ass like a kangaroo
see i met this woman from Hawaii
stuck it in her ass and she said &quot;iiiiiiiiieeeeee&quot;
lips was breakfast
pussy was lunch
then her titties busted open with hawaiian punch
met Colonel Sanders wife
in the state of Kentucky
she said i&#39;ll fry some chicken
if you just fuck me
i came in her mouth it was a crisis
i gave her my secret blend
of herbs and spices

Colt 45 and two zig-zags
Baby that&#39;s all we need
We can go to the door at the dogs
Smoke that tumbleweed
As the marijuana burn
we can take our turn
singin&#39; them dirty rap songs
stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong
i said it takes form him to hong kong
i said roll, roll, roll my joint
pick out the seeds and stems
feelin&#39; high as hell
flyin&#39; through palm bell
skatin&#39; on dragon wheels
so roll, roll, roll the &#39;83
cadillac coupe de ville
if my tapes and cd&#39;s just don&#39;t sell
i bet my cabby will

i met dolly parton in Tennesee
her titties were filled with hennesee
and that country music really drove me crazy
but i rolled that ass and said yes miss daizy
then i met this lady from Oklahoma
put her pussy in a coma
met this lady in Michigan
can&#39;t wait til i fuck that bitch again
met a real black girl in South Carolina
fucked her til she turned to a white albina
i fucked this hooker in Iowa
I fucked her on credit so i owe her
fucked this girl down in Georgia
i came in her mouth now i thought i told ya
met this beautiful sexy hoe
she just ran cross the border from Mexico
this fine young thing said her name&#39;s Maria
I wrapped her up just like a hot tortilla
i wanna get married ut i can&#39;t afford it
i know i&#39;m gonna cry when she get departed

Colt 45 and two zig-zags
Baby that&#39;s all we need
We can go to the door at the dogs
Smoke that tumbleweed
As the marijuana burn
we can take our turn
singin&#39; them dirty rap songs
stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong
i said it takes form him to hong kong
have you eva went ova a girl
starts to fuck but the pussy just ain&#39;t no good
i mean ya gettin&#39; upset
&#39;cause you can&#39;t get her wet
plus you in the wrong neighborhood
so you try to play it off
and eat the pussy
but it take her so long to come
then a dude walk in it&#39;s her big boyfriend
and he ask you where you from
so you wipe your mouth
and you ty to explain
you start talking real fast
but he already mad
&#39;cause you fuckin&#39; his one
so he start beatin&#39; on yo ass
so your clothes all muddy
your nose all bloody
your dick was hard but now it&#39;s soft
you thought you had a girl to rock ya world
but you still have to go jack off

Colt 45 and two zig-zags
Baby that&#39;s all we need
We can go to the door...</description>
