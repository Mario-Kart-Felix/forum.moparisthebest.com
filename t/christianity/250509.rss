    <description>Before you think I want to start this discussion all over again: I don&#39;t. I have a simple question: On what do you base your faith? Is it some experience you had, or is it just how you were raised? And don&#39;t just say you believe, but post why. I&#39;m not interested in who is a Christian here. 

So, why do you believe?</description>

<p>If thats true, how can you trust <span class="bbcode-b">anything</span> in the bible?<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">anything</span> could have been messed up as it was being passed from generation to generation.</p>
<p>lets say you think Jesus was the saviour, well actually it says Jesus was a penis but it got messed up when being passed from generation to generation. See what I mean, once you accept the bible is mutable your whole religion messes up.</p>
<p>I suppose I’ll explain that pi=3 thing in more detail</p>
<p>it wasnt like that, there is no verse where it says “pi is equal to whatever”</p>
<p>what happened is there was a circular bowl and the bible contains measurements of it, and we know that pi is equal to the ratio of the circumference over the diameter.</p>
<blockquote>He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits to measure around it.</blockquote>
<p>pi = circumference / diameter</p>
<p>pi = 30 / 10<br>
pi = 3</p>
<p>QED</p>
<p>If the bible was truely from god, there wouldnt be that mistake. This gives more credit to the theory that the bible was written by bronze age desert tribesmen.</p>
<p>Now what normally happens here is that some christian comes and gives his elaborate interpretation, that is normally something very implausable.</p>
<p>Similar things happen with the Koran, theres a verse which says “the earth, spread out like a carpet”, and muslims try to say “That doesnt mean the world is flat, if you’ve ever tried it, it is possible to put a carpet on a sphere”.</p>

<p>Not 9000 times, more like once. They translated it once from jewish to english (correct me if I’m wrong), for the english bible. And depends what form of religion your looking at. Some may say that yakman, (bibles), but thats because they’re morman, or those who add to the bible.</p>

Sorry, wasn’t thinking, Hebrew. Hebrew is a language, and yes, it has been translated many times, but, not likes this. Hebrew &gt; french &gt; english &gt; spanish. That’s what I’m getting at.</p>

I know more than what can be said in texts, or communicated. I’ve got wisdom, experiences that can’t be explained. Whether you believe me or not, I believe they happened. I may be a lunatic in your eyes. But as long as I am breathing, and have the ability to speak, I will profess my faith.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Elijah (I just keep on hammering on you, don’t I), you keep on talking about experiences that can’t be explained. By those experiences, you talk about feelings of joy, recognition, or anything? If that’s true, please consider my explanation of those feelings. (If you don’t mean that by experiences, please elaborate.)</p>
<p>When you go to a doctor, you know he is properly educated and knows what he’s doing. <span class="bbcode-b">You have faith in him.</span> If he gives you medication, you know it will help. If I gave you the same medication, you would be hesitating whether you should take it or not.</p>
<p>If you have small, unexplainable pains, the doctor probably thinks you have a serious case of being a whiny ass. But he doesn’t tell you that. He listens to you very careful, and comes up with a cure. He sends you to the pharmacy with a prescription. The pharmacist gives you a nice box saying Salsolutinsolusal. Once you arrive at your house, you eat two pills as prescribed. You do this twice a day, for a week. After a few days you start to feel good. You think that the pills did their job. But did they? Weren’t those pills simple placebo’s?</p>
<p>Why can’t the same apply to praying? You believe that someone listens to you, so it makes you feel good.[/quote]</p>
<p>This whole situation you described would make sense, for someone who doesn’t go to church for the right reasons. The ones that go to use it as a social hour. Meet the golf buddies, etc.</p>
<p>I, unlike many other people, would do research into what I was taking. I don’t follow blindly. If I get scripts from anyone other than a doctor. Of course I would be suspicious, even if it’s my own drug dealer. Even if I’ve known him for years, I’m still going to be cautious. But a doctor, I’m going to have some faith in them, because of their education. Just as I would have faith in a repairman, to repair my television properly.</p>
<p>But because I’m paranoid and have very little trust in anyone, I would still be cautious of them, regardless of their education. The difference between myself and the masses, is education. I’ve educated myself in certain areas. Just as you all have, and other intelligent people have.</p>
<p>Those experiences I was talking about didn’t exactly pertain to praying. More like events in my life that seem unexplainable. Which sure, anyone else would take it immediately as a sign of some sort, superstition. But I do research, I try and find a way to explain it. And When I can’t find an answer, or the answer is shown to me. Then I know it was God.</p>
<p>When I pray, I follow a certain order in my prayers. Firstly I ask for forgiveness of my sins. Second I worship him. And third I pray for needs that I need met. That’s how I pray. And my needs are always met, whether that be financially, or anything of the sort. I’m not saying it was miraculous what takes place, but it could be considered a miracle.</p>
<p>There’s a study of the bible, about sowing and reaping. And what it means to sow and reap. This is usually used by those scam artists to steal a bunch of money off of unsuspecting folks. But there’s a lot of truth in these verses and the study over them. When I give money for something, I am sowing money into something. When I get the item I paid money for, I’m reaping what I’ve sown.</p>
<p>It may not be so amazing and miraculous. But by sowing seed money into a $.99 cheeseburger, I’ve reaped a cheeseburger. That’s short term sowing and reaping. Let’s say God told me that someone needed money. So I, following God’s orders, I give a specific amount of money to a person. Not saying God gives me a specific amount, but I give what I feel is right.</p>
<p>That act is again, sowing. When this person gets the money, they may sow it into areas of their own. I may or may not have any yield from what I’ve sown, but by sowing money I have faith in God. It’s possible this person wasn’t saved before, but this act of kindness from a random stranger, gets them saved. That is what I’ve reaped.</p>
<p>So by giving a little bit of money to a person in need, and that person getting saved. That’s a miracle in my eyes. It may not be the definition of a miracle, but still. I’ve also had miraculous things happen to me as well.</p>
<p>That all really explains what happens when I pray. That doesn’t always happen, but it’s an example. So it shows that God listens. You may call it all circumstantial, but I don’t believe it is.</p>

<p>Anyway, spread the word is important in Christianity, so of course some are trying to convert you, but yes that you are talking about is to go to far.</p>

<p>I know more than what can be said in texts, or communicated. I’ve got wisdom, experiences that can’t be explained. Whether you believe me or not, I believe they happened. I may be a lunatic in your eyes. But as long as I am breathing, and have the ability to speak, I will profess my faith. </p>

</aside>
<p>Elijah (I just keep on hammering on you, don’t I), you keep on talking about experiences that can’t be explained. By those experiences, you talk about feelings of joy, recognition, or anything? If that’s true, please consider my explanation of those feelings. (If you don’t mean that by experiences, please elaborate.)</p>
<p>When you go to a doctor, you know he is properly educated and knows what he’s doing. <span class="bbcode-b">You have faith in him.</span> If he gives you medication, you know it will help. If I gave you the same medication, you would be hesitating whether you should take it or not.</p>
<p>If you have small, unexplainable pains, the doctor probably thinks you have a serious case of being a whiny ass. But he doesn’t tell you that. He listens to you very careful, and comes up with a cure. He sends you to the pharmacy with a prescription. The pharmacist gives you a nice box saying Salsolutinsolusal. Once you arrive at your house, you eat two pills as prescribed. You do this twice a day, for a week. After a few days you start to feel good. You think that the pills did their job. But did they? Weren’t those pills simple placebo’s?</p>
<p>Why can’t the same apply to praying? You believe that someone listens to you, so it makes you feel good.</p>

<p>10 - You vigorously deny the existence of thousands of gods claimed by other religions, but feel outraged when someone denies the existence of yours.</p>
<p>9 - You feel insulted and “dehumanized” when scientists say that people evolved from other life forms, but you have no problem with the Biblical claim that we were created from dirt.</p>
<p>8 - You laugh at polytheists, but you have no problem believing in a Triune God.</p>
<p>7 - Your face turns purple when you hear of the “atrocities” attributed to Allah, but you don’t even flinch when hearing about how God/Jehovah slaughtered all the babies of Egypt in “Exodus” and ordered the elimination of entire ethnic groups in “Joshua” including women, children, and trees!</p>
<p>6 - You laugh at Hindu beliefs that deify humans, and Greek claims about gods sleeping with women, but you have no problem believing that the Holy Spirit impregnated Mary, who then gave birth to a man-god who got killed, came back to life and then ascended into the sky.</p>
<p>5 - You are willing to spend your life looking for little loopholes in the scientifically established age of Earth (few billion years), but you find nothing wrong with believing dates recorded by Bronze Age tribesmen sitting in their tents and guessing that Earth is a few generations old.</p>
<p>4 - You believe that the entire population of this planet with the exception of those who share your beliefs – though excluding those in all rival sects - will spend Eternity in an infinite Hell of Suffering.  And yet consider your religion the most “tolerant” and “loving.”</p>
<p>3 - While modern science, history, geology, biology, and physics have failed to convince you otherwise, some idiot rolling around on the floor speaking in “tongues” may be all the evidence you need to “prove” Christianity.</p>
<p>2 - You define 0.01% as a “high success rate” when it comes to answered prayers.  You consider that to be evidence that prayer works.  And you think that the remaining 99.99% FAILURE was simply the will of God.</p>
<p>1 - You actually know a lot less than many atheists and agnostics do about the Bible, Christianity, and church history - but still call yourself a Christian.[/quote]</p>
<p>Many of those don’t characterize me really, a couple do. Although I’m not as strict in my beliefs. I can say that I am a bible toting, tongues speaking, man of God though. Whether you tolerate me or not, I’m still going to profess my faith to each and everyone of you. I may not force myself and my beliefs on you.</p>
<p>But because I do listen your arguments, and take them into consideration. Out of respect you should do the same, as you all have done so far. I don’t claim to know anymore about the bible than anyone else, in fact my knowledge isn’t of it isn’t that great at all. I can guarantee I know more about my God than any of you atheists.</p>
<p>I know more than what can be said in texts, or communicated. I’ve got wisdom, experiences that can’t be explained. Whether you believe me or not, I believe they happened. I may be a lunatic in your eyes. But as long as I am breathing, and have the ability to speak, I will profess my faith.</p>

<p>That is with everything (If everybody else do it, you will also do it.), and if you don’t think the religion is right like some here said they are free to do what they want, the religion is not forcing you or the leaders only maybe try to get you to change your mind.</p>

<p>All these christfags get annoying. Religion is like a fictional book. Nothing can prove it’s existence. I could run around saying my god is Aslan and Narnia is Heaven. Religion really is what you hold in your mind. Everything is fed on upon us by others, and trust me, I know. I’ve grown up in Catholic schools. I went to a Catholic elementary, middle, and now high. Religion is basically forced upon you. Your forced to go to church, take religious classes, pray. If Jesus Christ was real, I don’t think he intended for his word to be forced upon you. I would assume he would prefer it to be taught to you, and you take your own choice. Last year I decided to challenge a teacher on my agnostic beliefs and I wrote a 100 page(standard looseleaf lined paper) fictional religion. Anyone can write a religion. Though it’s hard to know what the bible really is because little is known about when it was written, more so who. It could of been a mock Scientology. Who knows…Maybe Scientology will turn out to be the next Christianity in good time. But that just shows that anyone(L. Ron Hubbard was a great science fiction writer, not intended to defer that) such as L. Ron Hubbard can write a religion. If you promise the people something, such as it’s promised that Jesus Christ will return to save us, people will believe it. It’s really just a matter of personal opinion. If your family practices extreme Christian views and they’re forced on you as a child, you will believe those as you grow older. You just have to think. In these economic times, <span class="bbcode-b">is the church in a recession?</span> I think not!</p>

<p>how does christianity differ from scientology then?</p>

</aside>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Christianity(Not talking about Catholicism here so there could be some difference from that) is not tricking people to use lot of money on stupid tests(They are false and used to trick money from people) and courses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It not made to avoid taxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not completely unrealistic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not commercial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You risk no harm quiting being a Christian except God wrath if he exist.<br>
[/quote]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Christianty has something far worse, it indoctronates children when they are still very little.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the only reason for this is that taxes didnt really exist all those years ago, but you could still say it was made for some other advantage, not nessecarily taxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what? water into wine? walking on water? dying then rising again 3 days later? christianity is also completely full of shit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>before captialism, the richest insitutions were the catholic churches, even now, they are still pretty rich.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what about total social exclusion if you live in certain parts of america?[/quote]<br>
5: This is bad I know thats what happen if extreme Christians get to much power and they are not following the Bible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>4: Yes that is a bad thing agree with you, but I was not talking about Catholics that yes exploited people to get power and money for building churches.</p>
<p>3: Unrealistic in that way that it could not happen, about that you are talking about there is fully possible if you are God. Only really unrealistic in the bible is that world is made in 6 <span class="bbcode-b">days</span>.</p>
<p>2: Tell me the advantage.</p>
<p>1: Yes, but you are free to get out of the Church when you get older and some parish don’t force it on children when they are young.</p>

Last year I decided to challenge a teacher on my agnostic beliefs and I wrote a 100 page(standard looseleaf lined paper) fictional religion. Anyone can write a religion. Though it’s hard to know what the bible really is because little is known about when it was written, more so who. It could of been a mock Scientology. Who knows…Maybe Scientology will turn out to be the next Christianity in good time. But that just shows that anyone(L. Ron Hubbard was a great science fiction writer, not intended to defer that) such as L. Ron Hubbard can write a religion. If you promise the people something, such as it’s promised that Jesus Christ will return to save us, people will believe it. It’s really just a matter of personal opinion. If your family practices extreme Christian views and they’re forced on you as a child, you will believe those as you grow older. You just have to think. In these economic times, <span class="bbcode-b">is the church in a recession?</span> I think not!</p>

<p>Christianty has something far worse, it indoctronates children when they are still very little.</p>

<li>
<p>the only reason for this is that taxes didnt really exist all those years ago, but you could still say it was made for some other advantage, not nessecarily taxes.</p>

The stories of the bible teach use to be good people: not to seal, be jealous, kill, etc. I think that we would have come up with these concepts on our own.</p>
<p>I personally do not if you or anyone else is religious, it is your life. I just feel that it is not required to live. We all have our own paths to inner peace, mine just does not include religion.</p>
