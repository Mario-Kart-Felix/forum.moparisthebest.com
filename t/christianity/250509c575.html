Jehovah’s Witnesses you are talking about?<br>
Don’t criticize a religion because of something a few people do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, spread the word is important in Christianity, so of course some are trying to convert you, but yes that you are talking about is to go to far.</p>

I know more than what can be said in texts, or communicated. I’ve got wisdom, experiences that can’t be explained. Whether you believe me or not, I believe they happened. I may be a lunatic in your eyes. But as long as I am breathing, and have the ability to speak, I will profess my faith.<br>

<p>Elijah (I just keep on hammering on you, don’t I), you keep on talking about experiences that can’t be explained. By those experiences, you talk about feelings of joy, recognition, or anything? If that’s true, please consider my explanation of those feelings. (If you don’t mean that by experiences, please elaborate.)</p>
<p>When you go to a doctor, you know he is properly educated and knows what he’s doing. <span class="bbcode-b">You have faith in him.</span> If he gives you medication, you know it will help. If I gave you the same medication, you would be hesitating whether you should take it or not.</p>

Weren’t those pills simple placebo’s?</p>
<p>Why can’t the same apply to praying? You believe that someone listens to you, so it makes you feel good.[/quote]</p>
<p>This whole situation you described would make sense, for someone who doesn’t go to church for the right reasons. The ones that go to use it as a social hour. Meet the golf buddies, etc.</p>
<p>I, unlike many other people, would do research into what I was taking. I don’t follow blindly. If I get scripts from anyone other than a doctor. Of course I would be suspicious, even if it’s my own drug dealer. Even if I’ve known him for years, I’m still going to be cautious. But a doctor, I’m going to have some faith in them, because of their education. Just as I would have faith in a repairman, to repair my television properly.</p>
<p>But because I’m paranoid and have very little trust in anyone, I would still be cautious of them, regardless of their education. The difference between myself and the masses, is education. I’ve educated myself in certain areas. Just as you all have, and other intelligent people have.</p>
<p>Those experiences I was talking about didn’t exactly pertain to praying. More like events in my life that seem unexplainable. Which sure, anyone else would take it immediately as a sign of some sort, superstition. But I do research, I try and find a way to explain it. And When I can’t find an answer, or the answer is shown to me. Then I know it was God.</p>
<p>When I pray, I follow a certain order in my prayers. Firstly I ask for forgiveness of my sins. Second I worship him. And third I pray for needs that I need met. That’s how I pray. And my needs are always met, whether that be financially, or anything of the sort. I’m not saying it was miraculous what takes place, but it could be considered a miracle.</p>
<p>There’s a study of the bible, about sowing and reaping. And what it means to sow and reap. This is usually used by those scam artists to steal a bunch of money off of unsuspecting folks. But there’s a lot of truth in these verses and the study over them. When I give money for something, I am sowing money into something. When I get the item I paid money for, I’m reaping what I’ve sown.</p>
<p>It may not be so amazing and miraculous. But by sowing seed money into a $.99 cheeseburger, I’ve reaped a cheeseburger. That’s short term sowing and reaping. Let’s say God told me that someone needed money. So I, following God’s orders, I give a specific amount of money to a person. Not saying God gives me a specific amount, but I give what I feel is right.</p>
<p>That act is again, sowing. When this person gets the money, they may sow it into areas of their own. I may or may not have any yield from what I’ve sown, but by sowing money I have faith in God. It’s possible this person wasn’t saved before, but this act of kindness from a random stranger, gets them saved. That is what I’ve reaped.</p>
<p>So by giving a little bit of money to a person in need, and that person getting saved. That’s a miracle in my eyes. It may not be the definition of a miracle, but still. I’ve also had miraculous things happen to me as well.</p>
<p>That all really explains what happens when I pray. That doesn’t always happen, but it’s an example. So it shows that God listens. You may call it all circumstantial, but I don’t believe it is.</p>

Not 9000 times, more like once. They translated it once from jewish to english (correct me if I’m wrong), for the english bible. And depends what form of religion your looking at. Some may say that yakman, (bibles), but thats because they’re morman, or those who add to the bible.</p>

Yes it have been translated lots of times (Ca  2454 different translations), even many times to the same language.</p>
<p>Yakman, one explanation is that the content bible was not written down all the time, but told from generation to generation. So 3.14… can have been shortened to 3.</p>

        <p>I think it went Aramaic/Hebrew to Greek and Latin to early Germanic languages and eventually English, so your best bet would be to learn Hebrew and draw your own conclusions from the Bible</p>

Sorry, wasn’t thinking, Hebrew. Hebrew is a language, and yes, it has been translated many times, but, not likes this. Hebrew &gt; french &gt; english &gt; spanish. That’s what I’m getting at.</p>

<p>If thats true, how can you trust <span class="bbcode-b">anything</span> in the bible?<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">anything</span> could have been messed up as it was being passed from generation to generation.</p>
<p>lets say you think Jesus was the saviour, well actually it says Jesus was a penis but it got messed up when being passed from generation to generation. See what I mean, once you accept the bible is mutable your whole religion messes up.</p>
<p>I suppose I’ll explain that pi=3 thing in more detail</p>
<p>it wasnt like that, there is no verse where it says “pi is equal to whatever”</p>
<p>what happened is there was a circular bowl and the bible contains measurements of it, and we know that pi is equal to the ratio of the circumference over the diameter.</p>
<blockquote>He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits to measure around it.</blockquote>
<p>pi = circumference / diameter</p>
<p>pi = 30 / 10<br>
pi = 3</p>
<p>QED</p>
<p>If the bible was truely from god, there wouldnt be that mistake. This gives more credit to the theory that the bible was written by bronze age desert tribesmen.</p>
<p>Now what normally happens here is that some christian comes and gives his elaborate interpretation, that is normally something very implausable.</p>
<p>Similar things happen with the Koran, theres a verse which says “the earth, spread out like a carpet”, and muslims try to say “That doesnt mean the world is flat, if you’ve ever tried it, it is possible to put a carpet on a sphere”.</p>
