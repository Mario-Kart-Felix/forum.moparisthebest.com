<p>actually it can be explained with a simple and elegant solution.</p>
<p>god doesnt exist. (the all knowing god that allows free will)</p>

By knowing what you are going to do, if you don’t know your own future you will not try to change it therefor god can know your future without choose what you do or trying to prevent it (But sometimes he may save you, like in situation you should be dead.(Anyway one in may class said he have seen an angel.)).</p>

<p>that makes no sense.</p>
<p>perhaps ill rephrase the question to make it easier for you,<br>
how can god justify sending people to hell when he knows they’re going to be bad anyway.</p>
<p>the point is that if god knows what you’re going to do, then free will doesnt exist because everything appears to have already been decided.</p>

</aside>
<p>By knowing what you are going to do, if you don’t know your own future you will not try to change it therefor god can know your future without choose what you do or trying to prevent it (But sometimes he may save you, like in situation you should be dead.(Anyway one in may class said he have seen an angel.)).<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>that makes no sense.</p>
<p>perhaps ill rephrase the question to make it easier for you,<br>
how can god justify sending people to hell when he knows they’re going to be bad anyway.</p>
<p>the point is that if god knows what you’re going to do, then free will doesnt exist because everything appears to have already been decided.[/quote]<br>
First statement: Because people have free will, and therefore God don’t do something directly about it.</p>
<p>It have not been decided you are one who decide it, do you know what you are going to do tomorrow?<br>
If yes you future is decided and God may know it, but there is your own choose.</p>
<p>Even without God you don’t have completely free will, your personality have much to say what you are doing and much of your personality is affected by other (Family, friend, genes.)</p>
<p>(I clearly understood your question I just write a little messy there.)</p>

        <p>I wear a cross. I’m not Christian.</p>
<p>All these christfags get annoying. Religion is like a fictional book. Nothing can prove it’s existence. I could run around saying my god is Aslan and Narnia is Heaven. Religion really is what you hold in your mind. Everything is fed on upon us by others, and trust me, I know. I’ve grown up in Catholic schools. I went to a Catholic elementary, middle, and now high. Religion is basically forced upon you. Your forced to go to church, take religious classes, pray. If Jesus Christ was real, I don’t think he intended for his word to be forced upon you. I would assume he would prefer it to be taught to you, and you take your own choice. Last year I decided to challenge a teacher on my agnostic beliefs and I wrote a 100 page(standard looseleaf lined paper) fictional religion. Anyone can write a religion. Though it’s hard to know what the bible really is because little is known about when it was written, more so who. It could of been a mock Scientology. Who knows…Maybe Scientology will turn out to be the next Christianity in good time. But that just shows that anyone(L. Ron Hubbard was a great science fiction writer, not intended to defer that) such as L. Ron Hubbard can write a religion. If you promise the people something, such as it’s promised that Jesus Christ will return to save us, people will believe it. It’s really just a matter of personal opinion. If your family practices extreme Christian views and they’re forced on you as a child, you will believe those as you grow older. You just have to think. In these economic times, <span class="bbcode-b">is the church in a recession?</span> I think not!</p>

        <p>I am not a Christian. I was raised a Christian but have been an atheist for about there years now. I became a atheist simply because I believe there is no reason to have faith. The stories of the bible teach use to be good people: not to seal, be jealous, kill, etc. I think that we would have come up with these concepts on our own.</p>
<p>I personally do not if you or anyone else is religious, it is your life. I just feel that it is not required to live. We all have our own paths to inner peace, mine just does not include religion.</p>

Who knows…Maybe Scientology will turn out to be the next Christianity in good time. But that just shows that anyone(L. Ron Hubbard was a great science fiction writer, not intended to defer that) such as L. Ron Hubbard can write a religion. If you promise the people something, such as it’s promised that Jesus Christ will return to save us, people will believe it. It’s really just a matter of personal opinion. If your family practices extreme Christian views and they’re forced on you as a child, you will believe those as you grow older. You just have to think. In these economic times, <span class="bbcode-b">is the church in a recession?</span> I think not!</p>

<p>I wear a cross. I’m not Christian.</p>
<p>All these christfags get annoying. Religion is like a fictional book. Nothing can prove it’s existence. I could run around saying my god is Aslan and Narnia is Heaven. Religion really is what you hold in your mind. Everything is fed on upon us by others, and trust me, I know. I’ve grown up in Catholic schools. I went to a Catholic elementary, middle, and now high. Religion is basically forced upon you. Your forced to go to church, take religious classes, pray. If Jesus Christ was real, I don’t think he intended for his word to be forced upon you. I would assume he would prefer it to be taught to you, and you take your own choice. Last year I decided to challenge a teacher on my agnostic beliefs and I wrote a 100 page(standard looseleaf lined paper) fictional religion. Anyone can write a religion.

<p>4: Yes that is a bad thing agree with you, but I was not talking about Catholics that yes exploited people to get power and money for building churches.</p>
<p>3: Unrealistic in that way that it could not happen, about that you are talking about there is fully possible if you are God. Only really unrealistic in the bible is that world is made in 6 <span class="bbcode-b">days</span>.</p>
<p>2: Tell me the advantage.</p>
<p>1: Yes, but you are free to get out of the Church when you get older and some parish don’t force it on children when they are young.</p>

<p>That is with everything (If everybody else do it, you will also do it.), and if you don’t think the religion is right like some here said they are free to do what they want, the religion is not forcing you or the leaders only maybe try to get you to change your mind.</p>

        <p>Top Ten Signs You’re a Fundamentalist Christian</p>
<p>10 - You vigorously deny the existence of thousands of gods claimed by other religions, but feel outraged when someone denies the existence of yours.</p>
<p>9 - You feel insulted and “dehumanized” when scientists say that people evolved from other life forms, but you have no problem with the Biblical claim that we were created from dirt.</p>
<p>8 - You laugh at polytheists, but you have no problem believing in a Triune God.</p>
<p>7 - Your face turns purple when you hear of the “atrocities” attributed to Allah, but you don’t even flinch when hearing about how God/Jehovah slaughtered all the babies of Egypt in “Exodus” and ordered the elimination of entire ethnic groups in “Joshua” including women, children, and trees!</p>
<p>6 - You laugh at Hindu beliefs that deify humans, and Greek claims about gods sleeping with women, but you have no problem believing that the Holy Spirit impregnated Mary, who then gave birth to a man-god who got killed, came back to life and then ascended into the sky.</p>
<p>5 - You are willing to spend your life looking for little loopholes in the scientifically established age of Earth (few billion years), but you find nothing wrong with believing dates recorded by Bronze Age tribesmen sitting in their tents and guessing that Earth is a few generations old.</p>
<p>4 - You believe that the entire population of this planet with the exception of those who share your beliefs – though excluding those in all rival sects - will spend Eternity in an infinite Hell of Suffering.  And yet consider your religion the most “tolerant” and “loving.”</p>
<p>3 - While modern science, history, geology, biology, and physics have failed to convince you otherwise, some idiot rolling around on the floor speaking in “tongues” may be all the evidence you need to “prove” Christianity.</p>
<p>2 - You define 0.01% as a “high success rate” when it comes to answered prayers.  You consider that to be evidence that prayer works.  And you think that the remaining 99.99% FAILURE was simply the will of God.</p>
<p>1 - You actually know a lot less than many atheists and agnostics do about the Bible, Christianity, and church history - but still call yourself a Christian.</p>

<p>Many of those don’t characterize me really, a couple do. Although I’m not as strict in my beliefs. I can say that I am a bible toting, tongues speaking, man of God though. Whether you tolerate me or not, I’m still going to profess my faith to each and everyone of you. I may not force myself and my beliefs on you.</p>
<p>But because I do listen your arguments, and take them into consideration. Out of respect you should do the same, as you all have done so far. I don’t claim to know anymore about the bible than anyone else, in fact my knowledge isn’t of it isn’t that great at all. I can guarantee I know more about my God than any of you atheists.</p>
<p>I know more than what can be said in texts, or communicated. I’ve got wisdom, experiences that can’t be explained. Whether you believe me or not, I believe they happened. I may be a lunatic in your eyes. But as long as I am breathing, and have the ability to speak, I will profess my faith.</p>
