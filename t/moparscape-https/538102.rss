    <title>Moparscape HTTPS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparscape-https/538102</link>
    <description>I usually connect to moparscape via my speed dial.
The address is: https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/
For some odd reason I can&#39;t connect to that address anymore.
I have to change https to http.

Anyone a clue why?</description>

You pull the roots you get the whole tree. Now before I go say anything else that might as well make me seem stupid I have to say I am quite tech illiterate. I’ve never really bothered to learn much about computers and networking other than what I want. So after clicking and reading on that first link in the search I noticed that http and https uses different ports. If I’m thinking this works the way I’m guessing it does then are ports 443 for https disabled on this websites servers? There was also something mentioned about Certificates that I was to lazy to look-up. Again, I’m no tech savvy Bill Gates so I have no clue what I am talking about other than the 2 minutes of research I just did.<br>
[/quote]what is this shit? op was pointing out that moparscape https is broken for some reason and wants an admin to look into it, or see if anyone else has been told. i don’t think he wants some clueless idiot to find out what https is and speculate on a few random causes of the problem.<br>
[/quote]Yeah, but then he had make himself look like a jackass… twice.[/quote]</p>
<p>It was pretty funny though, let’s be honest</p>

<p>The difference between HTTP and HTTPS is irrelevant. A lot of Google links to our site that used to work no longer work, and some internal links (I was unable to send a PM yesterday) also break.</p>
