This game takes a lot of strategy and a lot of team work/cooperation.

The basic concept of the game is you are in an airship and you are either doing Death Match, or Capture the Balloon. Whilist you&#39;re either doing 2v2 or 3v3.

There are 3 roles, and 4 people per ship.

Pilot
Gunner
Engineer

The Pilot is usually the commander, and they tell everyone what they should be doing if they are not actually doing it.
The Gunner just shoots and runs around the ship to other guns, but can do basic repairs

The Engineer(Which is my favorite thing to do) Is all of the above. They are mainly they to fix the damages taken during battle. But they can Shoot, and Pilot as-well. I am a fairly decent Pilot, and a good gunner.

There are different things on the ship that can cause problems, Engines breaking so you can&#39;t move, or your Balloon popping, so you need to repair it before you hit the ground.

And if you jump off the ship, it just spawns you back in the ship. I tried it...

The community is fairly small, and it isn&#39;t a popular game. (~4,000 players in total)
They host events http://gunsoficarus.com/community/bounty-board/
Where you volunteer to have a bounty on you, and players get to try to defeat you in-game. If you defeat them and show the creators you get a reward.

I got 2 today. Going to try and get more later.

But over-all it is a pretty fun game. It has minor bugs, nothing that stops gameplay, and it is overall an enjoyable game.</description>
