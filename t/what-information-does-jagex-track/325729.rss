    <title>What information does Jagex Track?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-information-does-jagex-track/325729</link>
    <description>Haven&#39;t been very active around here, but the SCAR/SIMBA community is still alive, though we have been reduced to a marginal group in the light of the current JAVA RS-cheating scene. I have a burning question about what kind of information Jagex sends to their servers. Some years ago there was consensus about Mouse Clicks; currently it is believed that Jagex also tracks mouse movements.   And since I regard this insideforum as state-of-the-art in cheating, I turn to you guys. 

What information does Jagex Track?</description>

<p>It is possible they implement a similar system to steam bans. It’s well known a steam ban can be brought into action hours, days, weeks and sometimes months after detection. RS maybe not opting for the latter, however if they’re confident in their ability to stop people trading items between accounts I wouldn’t be surprised if they allowed some kind of delay before a ban comes in to effect. It would certainly be effective in putting us off their tracks.</p>
<p>Not to mention the huge backlog they probably have on in-game reports anyway. So there’s probably already a delay, intended or not.</p>

when do you have -1 gp? and since when does a partial verification implicate a full verification?[/quote]<br>
You can edit it with a memory editor, the stack size changes with the value in the memory. Obviously it doesn’t stick but the visual representation of what it would look like is still valid.</p>

<p>the size and height of the coin stack when dropped varies with the amount of gold,<br>
e.g.<br>
1gp = 1 small coin<br>
999gp &gt; x &gt; 2gp = small stack<br>
99k &gt; x &gt; 1k = medium stack<br>
999k &gt; x &gt; 100k = large stack<br>
1000k+ = very large stack</p>

<p>The minus stack obviously followed the same rules, but in negation. I thought that was obvious?[/quote]</p>
<p>who said? afaik that just isn’t true… the client doesn’t take the absolute value of the stack size for its comparisons.</p>

              <p>iirc wL has a character that got invited to be a player mod.</p>
<p>None of my bots were ever invited but then again I implemented the auto reporting late in my rs hacking life. I still stand by what I’ve said in the past. They detect you. It happens. You’ll likely make mistakes that trip some alarms. These triggers/marks/etc are taken in context with other factors. When you get reported your last 60 seconds is packaged into a nice pretty bow and pushed onto a queue for some minimum wage customer service rep to view. There are other factors at play but eventually if your account has tripped enough wires it will fast track to a rep’s viewer. Here they watch the report evidence. From there you have to be aces with your bot to get the rep to believe you are a real person and not a bot. Sometimes, I imagine, it doesn’t matter - ultimately if the rep thinks you’re a bot there’s no amount of good code you can write to trick them. This is where tripping alarms flippantly is damaging. I assume (because that’s all I can do really) that my bots have never tripped enough alarms that when reported have swayed the rep into believing beyond all hope that I was a bot…</p>
<p>Let’s be real - how many of us can be fooled by any of the bots out in public? Your bot doesn’t have to be perfect all the time… It just has to be perfect for the 60 seconds after you get reported. And even then it may be too late based on your ‘history’.</p>
<p>So to sum up, yes player reports are important. But the details involved with you getting a ban are complicated.</p>
<p>For example there are some things that you can do which will get you instantly banned. (i.e. dropping -2 billion gold, and laughing at the poor ass that picked it up comes to mind - it was great one dumbass picked it up, then dropped it immediately having lost ALL the gold in his inventory… then another ass picked it up… and so on… it was hilarious. I don’t know how it stayed quiet - it affected quite a few players and what made it so funny was that -2billion gold looks exactly like 2billion gold on the ground - only if you paid close attention would you realize it was negative) <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> So - I cannot say that I’ve never had a character banned… but that was by far one of the most memorable.</p>
<p>but there are other things that you can do which just chalks marks on your account. All of these things are taken into account (unless they are instaban infractions) when the report comes your way.</p>
<p>To be honest though, from what I’ve observed first hand, I’ve been reported many times on many accounts I’m almost certain. Most of us do the same thing when we’re reporting someone… we go idle and don’t talk and simply sit there. My bot’s have recorded that happening around them many many many times. I’m sure I’ve been reported alot, but the important thing is having very few wires tripped and making for dang sure that when the rep looks at the replay, your bot looks as human as possible. One of the best ways you can find out if your bot looks human - implement your own playback system. (Do it… wL did it and inspired me to write my own). Then watch your own bots. If you can objectively watch them and come to the conclusion they are human - rejoice… if not… keep working. In the end, you’ll never really know when you’re reported… so your bots need to be convincing all the time.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure that’s already been done, I think with Aryan.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Fakawi</span>, I’m not sure I completely agree.  The only main account that I played on was moparsthbest, and I only botted with him (with SCAR) with scripts that I knew wouldn’t mess up, or I sat there and watched him.  So he never should have had very suspicious activity, then one night I was writing a new fletching script where he just stood at a very busy bank, so the chances of him getting reported was about 0.  The script messed up while I was asleep and he just kept clicking on a random spot on the screen.  I did some legitimate stuff with him for about 10 minutes and then logged out and was banned when I tried to log back in later that day.  I seriously doubt it was due to reporting, it <em>could</em> have been due to being logged in for maybe 8+ hours, but then I’d done that many times before as well probably.</p>

<p>Reporting other players would probably be quite a good way to add a level of legitimacy to your own botted accounts, along with occasionally partaking in conversations.<br>
It’s infeasible for Jagex to analyse every single account, so fooling the surrounding players would count for much more than any trivial technique concerned with fooling their analysis after you’ve been reported.</p>
