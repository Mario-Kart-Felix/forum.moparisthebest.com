    <title>[711] Create &amp; Open New Dialogue From Command [Rep++]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/711-create-open-new-dialogue-from-command-rep/442066</link>
    <description>I need to know how to create a new dialogue and open it from a command. I see that dialogues in 711 have their own classes, which is much harder than what something like 639 has.

If someone could link me to a tutorial, that would be amazing. I searched and searched to now avail.

Oh and all my dialogue needs is clickable options, no other text/dialogue.</description>
