there are some brief images for you.
I was looking for awhile how to make the log out button on the top, make the hp&#39; pray&#39; run, on the top also and where you see the trade, assist etc. 

Im not good at explaining as you can see... so i did put pictures...
I have used the search button...
I have looked all over....

If ANY of you can give me some information about this... it will GREATLY appreciated.
