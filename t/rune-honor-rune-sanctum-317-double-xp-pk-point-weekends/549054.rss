Why should you choose to play Rune-Sanctum/Rune-Honor over other servers?

A very good question.. But a very simple answer which is, Rune-Sanctum/Rune-Honor cares about it&#39;s players, it cares about it&#39;s economy, it cares about how the server is ran and what the players suggest and what they want. We do everything we possible can to ensure that the players of Rune-Sanctum/Rune-Honor enjoy playing the game and get the most friendly, fun and enjoyable game play they can!

The server does frequent and daily updates almost every day, you can view all/most of the updates that happen on Rune-Sanctum/Rune-Honor on the update-log on the forums. Rune-Sanctum/Rune-Honor focuses on every players enjoyment, we have every aspect of game-play that we know players enjoy PvM, PvP, skilling, you name it we have it! We are not like other servers which are ignorant to there players and just ignores there opinions and even ignores there players when they talk to them.. I have played over 50 servers over the past 4 years and have watched very carefully how the best servers are ran and also how the bad servers are ran, I have learnt there mistakes and adapted to how the best servers are ran which is why Rune-Sanctum/Rune-Honor is the place for you.

Both of our servers are ran by Highly trained staff teams who do their best to make your enjoyment and your stay on the server we try our best to add daily game content to also make the server more competitive as well as weekly events where my staff team will fluoridate so we can all have decent fun!

We put time into FUN and ENJOYMENT!

              <p>For as ugly as this advertisement thread is, I can guarantee both servers are great. One being based off notorious while the other arios, they both have great potential. I will be allocating most of my time working with Rune Sanctum (ironic how its named off my old server from three years ago), but I will also be helping out on Rune Honor when I have the time to do so.</p>
