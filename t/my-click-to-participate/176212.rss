    <description>Ok, in that other post.
I just threw away what I was using in my &#39;PHP/MySQL HELP!?&#39; thread.

This next one I had to write up by myself. Although, I did use SOME little snippets off of Kplop&#39;s post in the &#39;PHP/MySQL HELP!?&#39; thread.

Yes, I know.
It needs A LOT of work.

Well, maybe not a lot. But a bit.

EDIT;;
Also, I noticed that the reCAPTCHA doesn&#39;t work that well. For some odd reason you can still get 1 - 3 letters/numbers wrong and still it gets accepted. This one won&#39;e be on much longer, I can&#39;t allow it. Because if anyeone wants to null the database, it would be really easy.
I&#39;m taking a few steps to taking care of that.</description>
