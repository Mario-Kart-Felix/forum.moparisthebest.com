              <p>It probably was a server that is not up all the time. I suggest you play on a server that up 24/7.</p>

              <p>What private server was it? A Hybrid Server (one you start with the MoparScape client)? If it was, it only saves the stuff you have done on itâ€™s cache for a limited amount of time then deletes it. If it was a Personal Private Server then the owner might have cleaned out all of the character files.</p>
