    <title>Skillcape Emotes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/skillcape-emotes/155080</link>
    <description>Can anyone walk me through adding skill cape emotes, or at least point me in the direction of a decent tutorial? Currently all the emotes are set as normal dance and wave ans stuff. I looked for a tutorial but couldn&#39;t find one :(. By the way, the emotes were for some else! FFS, today is not my day. Also does anyone have an emote list?

Any help?</description>

              <p>Here’s a short tut to add the skillcape emote to the yes button…</p>
<p>go to client.java…</p>
<p>then follow dragonchains instructions, then</p>
<p>search for update();</p>
<p>under that add</p>
<p>sendFrame126("<span class="mention">@whi</span>@sklcpe", 180);//first emote slot</p>
<p>Then search for: case 168, if you don’t have that search case 169</p>
<p>then if you have case 168 it should have something like</p>
<p>case 168:<br>
startAnimation(#,###);<br>
break;</p>
<p>replace it to this (and if you don’t have it, then make it…)</p>
<p>case 168:<br>
if (playerEquipment[playerCape] == <span class="bbcode-b">capeID</span>) {<br>
stillgfx(<span class="bbcode-b">gfxID</span>, absY, absX);<br>
stillgfx(<span class="bbcode-b">gfxID</span>, absY, absX);<br>
stillgfx(<span class="bbcode-b">gfxID</span>, absY, absX);<br>
}</p>
<p>you need to replace the bold with your ids tho… there I think that’s correct… <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=6" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

}</code></p>
<p>And keep adding those for moe cape emotes, also find a emote case for it, so when you click it, it does the emote, if not you need my help again just post here, but wat you doin the emote case is add <span class="bbcode-b">capeEmote();</span> and then your done! So if you need any help with the emote case please do post here.</p>

              <p>Can anyone walk me through adding skill cape emotes, or at least point me in the direction of a decent tutorial? Currently all the emotes are set as normal dance and wave ans stuff. I looked for a tutorial but couldn’t find one :(. By the way, the emotes were for some else! FFS, today is not my day. Also does anyone have an emote list?</p>
<p>Any help?</p>
