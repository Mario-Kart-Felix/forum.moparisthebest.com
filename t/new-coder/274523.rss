    <title>New coder :)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-coder/274523</link>
    <description>Okay, I&#39;m a new coder, I have never used Java in my life, the only thing I know how to do is change the name on a server and how to portfoward. I want to know how to make my own client and source from scratch and do it in a reasonable amount of time, but I hear its hard, so if anyone has any codes/programs/etc; that would be greatly appreaciated ;)
Well, thanks guys, and thanks to Dark Boe for teacinhg me to start basic item codes and how to portfoward, thanks bro I owe you a WHOLE lot :).
