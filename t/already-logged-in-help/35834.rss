&quot;Your Account Is Already Logged In
Try Again Now, Or Make Another Name&quot;   (Quote)

So i made another account and it logged in lost connection and went to login screen i clicked log in again and it said that account was already logged in?

          <blockquote>
              <p>No, because of the insanely crappy way current servers are designed, the main thread is doing the proccessing for every single player. So if the processing for a player throws an unexpected Exception, then the main thread stops, and processing for players stops for ALL players. However, logging in is handled in a <span class="bbcode-i">different</span> thread, so people can still log in.</p>
<p>The result: people are logging in, but no effort is made to process the connection, so that player loses connection. Now, there is yet ANOTHER thread running: the playerhandler thread. If it detects that player has logged in and hasn’t yet logged out, it will refuse the connection with a “You are already logged in” message. Since processing for each player has stopped by this point, nobody is ever logged off, and it will always continue giving that login error.</p>
<p>So, what causes the unexpected Exception that terminates the main thread in the first place? The answer is using an item on an NPC. The server misinterprets it as attacking a player that doesn’t exist, and the main thread terminates with an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, which leads to the events I previously described.</p>
<p>How can you stop the error? Well, for the moment, you can’t, because no source has a server with proper architechture. But soon the CMs will release one, we’re developing a (basic) server that has much more functionality that anything currently available. Note - we won’t be releasing the finished product, but we will let people use it. The IP will change often, and only selected people will get to join.</p>
