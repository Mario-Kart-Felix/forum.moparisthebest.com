    <title>Need some help with editting a cache. [PAID] [HURRY]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-some-help-with-editting-a-cache-paid-hurry/553917</link>
    <description>Hey there,

I am currently using the Ruse source, but when i try to edit and pack the cache using Galkon&#39;s Sprite Tool it doesn&#39;t work.
I&#39;m pretty sure the error is at the tool because it doesn&#39;t read the sprite folder correctly.

I need someone to fix it up for me or get another working tool/way to edit and pack the cache. I don&#39;t care how as long as it works.
I will be paying 10$ (since this is probably need hard to go when you know how) after it&#39;s working and i am 100% sure i know how to do it myself.

Time is running out for me so i need this to be done fast.

<p>First of all, this is the wrong topic section for this. Second, offering payment on these forums is against the rules. Many people are willing to help you without payment, so atleast try to get some free help and save your money first. I will skype you.</p>
