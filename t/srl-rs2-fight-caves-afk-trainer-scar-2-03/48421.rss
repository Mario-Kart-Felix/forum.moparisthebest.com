    <description>[b][size=4]Version: BETA 1.6.1[/size][/b]
[i]Chat fixer added to adjust user to recomended script settings.[/i]

Alright, I&#39;ve already posted most of the info on my site, so if you want to see the official download page for the script, then [url=http://dizzycoders.speedsoft.uni.cc/scar/scripts.php?id=1]click here[/url].

This is a remake of the original version - this time, using  SRL.
Before the script used the SSI2 include, which is now outdated BIG TIME. So I finnaly decided to upgrade! After testing the script with SRL, I was amazed. Everything seemed to run alot smoother (yes, that includes the mouse :P).

So I thank the people for working hard on creating the ultimate include, SRL.

Here&#39;s some info taken off of the site about the script:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Features: Logs in if you are logged out when you start the script. Special waitin procedures made for people who don&#39;t have a fast internet connection. Less laggy bitmap and color finding procedures. More accurate and faster AFK waiting procedure (Our main target of updating at the moment), Re-enters caves when you lose, A little slow but good login procedure (Slow on purpose for Dial-up users), will logout after a specified amount of rounds, IF wanted to: the script will log back in after sleeping for about 15-30 minutes. Etc..&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now, here&#39;s some info taken off of the script (on how to setup the script):
&lt;blockquote&gt;{.Setting up the script/recomended game settings:
# We recomend leaving your private chat ON, or on FRIENDS.
# The Cave Color rarely changes, so the pre-set color STILL WORKS.
# We still recomend that you update the Cave Color atleast once a day.
# The script can work on Normal brightness, but it&#39;s recomended that you
# run the script on Very-Bright.
# Setting up DeathTotal: In the setup form, you will see DeathTotal.
# DeathTotal is how much times you want the script to enter the caves
# (and most likely lose though). Once DeathTotal hits its Mark (whatever
# number you set it to), the script will log your character off and take
# a break. If you checked &#39;Log back in&#39;, then the script will log your
# character back on, then reset the DeathTotal to the mark you set.
# Therefor creating a loop.
# The time the script takes a break for is RANDOM. From 15-30 minutes.
# In the later versions, we will be adding Sleeper marks which will make
# the script act like if you went to sleep for a while (as if you were
# taking a cat nap, or actually sleeping for 2 hours).
# ....................................................................../

 If you need any help setting up the script or find any bugs/errors,
   then please contact us via email:

              [email]dizzycoders@yahoo.com[/email]
# Thank you.

/Setup Help}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If you need any help with the script or find and bugs/errors, then please contact me via email at: [email]dizzycoders@yahoo.com[/email]

Thank you and have fun cheating,

<p>Well yea, I’ve been thinking about that. I’ve also been working on a better waiting procedure that is nearly constantly checking if you’re not in the caves, fighting, etc., which would also be less laggy.</p>
<p>Also, this is the FREE version of the script, so I don’t plan to make this script too good.</p>
<p>Thanks for reminding me about walking around the caves though. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>You have to wait a bit. It sleeps for random amount of time THEN checks for all of the bitmaps, colors, etc.</p>
<p>That’s why I’m fixing the sleeping procedure, so it checks if it lost more often, but it might make the script a little laggy.</p>
<p>Oh and for the errors, urlali, I’ve gotten those fixed. Just give me a bit to upload the script.</p>

              <p><span class="bbcode-b">[size=4]Version: BETA 1.6.1[/size]</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Chat fixer added to adjust user to recomended script settings.</span></p>
<p>Alright, I’ve already posted most of the info on my site, so if you want to see the official download page for the script, then <a href="http://dizzycoders.speedsoft.uni.cc/scar/scripts.php?id=1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">click here</a>.</p>
<p>This is a remake of the original version - this time, using  SRL.<br>
Before the script used the SSI2 include, which is now outdated BIG TIME. So I finnaly decided to upgrade! After testing the script with SRL, I was amazed. Everything seemed to run alot smoother (yes, that includes the mouse :P).</p>
<p>So I thank the people for working hard on creating the ultimate include, SRL.</p>
<p>Here’s some info taken off of the site about the script:</p>
<blockquote>Features: Logs in if you are logged out when you start the script. Special waitin procedures made for people who don't have a fast internet connection. Less laggy bitmap and color finding procedures. More accurate and faster AFK waiting procedure (Our main target of updating at the moment), Re-enters caves when you lose, A little slow but good login procedure (Slow on purpose for Dial-up users), will logout after a specified amount of rounds, IF wanted to: the script will log back in after sleeping for about 15-30 minutes. Etc..</blockquote>
<p>Now, here’s some info taken off of the script (on how to setup the script):</p>
<blockquote>{.Setting up the script/recomended game settings:
# We recomend leaving your private chat ON, or on FRIENDS.
# The Cave Color rarely changes, so the pre-set color STILL WORKS.
# We still recomend that you update the Cave Color atleast once a day.
# The script can work on Normal brightness, but it's recomended that you
# run the script on Very-Bright.
# Setting up DeathTotal: In the setup form, you will see DeathTotal.
# DeathTotal is how much times you want the script to enter the caves
# (and most likely lose though). Once DeathTotal hits its Mark (whatever
# number you set it to), the script will log your character off and take
# a break. If you checked 'Log back in', then the script will log your
# character back on, then reset the DeathTotal to the mark you set.
# Therefor creating a loop.
# The time the script takes a break for is RANDOM. From 15-30 minutes.
# In the later versions, we will be adding Sleeper marks which will make
# the script act like if you went to sleep for a while (as if you were
# taking a cat nap, or actually sleeping for 2 hours).
# ....................................................................../
