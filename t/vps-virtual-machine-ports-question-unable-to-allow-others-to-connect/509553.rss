    <title>VPS/Virtual Machine/Ports question. Unable to allow others to connect</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vps-virtual-machine-ports-question-unable-to-allow-others-to-connect/509553</link>
    <description>Quick question.

I&#39;m on a mac, but I have a win7 VM installed, so I code and do my server on that.
I&#39;m having tons of issues getting other people to connect to the server and I&#39;m pretty sure it has to do with the fact that I&#39;m on a VM - the ports get all screwed up, I can&#39;t properly port-forward ect.

Two questions:  
1) Does anyone know how to get others to access my server, even if I&#39;m running it through a VM?  
2) If I use a vps to host the site once I&#39;m finished coding it and stuff, does it even matter?  They&#39;re hosting it, so isn&#39;t the only concern THEIR ports, ect.  I guess the point with this question is:  If I use a VPS to host the server, can I leave my current NON-WORKING settings for others to get on alone, and would people still be able to connect because its through a VPS?

Any help would be appreciated.  My skype is Flubby_PB if you think you can assist me.  This has been going on for days now.. :(</description>
