    <title>Need help with with environment variables. (Windows 7)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-with-environment-variables-windows-7/526382</link>
    <description>Hello,

So I want to start a server again, but my java seems to have problems. I always have that &quot;The system cannot find the path specified&quot; error, although I have set my environment variables and I have edited the &quot;run&quot; and &quot;compile&quot; files to the current JDK and JRE versions.

Can someone give me the right codes, that I need to add there, and tell which box they should be and how to add them the right way? :D</description>
