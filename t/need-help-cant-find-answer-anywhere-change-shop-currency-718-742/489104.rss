              <p>Not sure if you have found out yet but go into your source then data/items and there should a file called unpacked shops, when you open that the second column in will be the currency, the majority of them will be 995 just find the shop that the currency is fist of guthix tokens and change it to 995.<br>
Once you have done that save and close then delete the file unpackedshops.s and that it.<br>
You can compile and should be all working</p>
<p>Hope this helped.</p>
