    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Internet problem :( 

Basically I left my computer on one day while I was at school, when I return home I try and go to a forum using mozzilla firefox, I get the error www.whatever can not be found, please check the name and try again. Still doesn’t work so I try some other forums I wanted to go to, none working.. Then I try goggle that works. Strange. Then I go to this website Runescape that also works, it’s a game and from the website you choose different ‘worlds’ (servers) to play from, only some of the servers work.. Other pages can not be displayed. Very strange.

Then I try some other websites out, its not just forums that don’t work, some websites also work. I can’t see any relationship between the websites that work and the ones that don’t.

Then I try using internet explorer.. Some pages do and don’t work. Sometimes this one website I keep using does work; sometimes it doesn’t, so this is really confusing.

Then I try using vent.. Most servers don’t work, one did and im sure there would be more if I tried connecting to others. 

 Online games such as guild wars and jedi knight work no problem. However today jedi knight stopped working, perhaps it’s a virus or something that’s causing the problem and blocking things I like to use?

I have tried restarting my router and computer of course... I’ve had this problem for a few days now. The Jedi knight not working is making me seek some help lol.

I’ve ran virus scans and things.. I have around 157 things which I have to remove personally says Norton… it takes a long time and I usually leave them so it’s probably not them. 

I always disable my Norton professional firewall to use the internet and ive turned windows firewall off… A lot of people are suggesting firewall issues.

I can’t really think of the cause of all this.

Any help is greatly appreciated; it’s most likely I need a friend to post on any forums this goes on because I probably can’t visit it.

Cheers.

I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on.  

I&#39;ll relay the answers back to him.</description>
