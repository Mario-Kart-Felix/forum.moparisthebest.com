<ol>
<li>
<p>A home that is not Varrock, Edgeville, or Lumbridge. I’m so sick of seeing those places, <span class="bbcode-b">especially</span> Edgeville. There has to be unique content (which can even include reasonable custom items), and if I see screenshots of features commonly found in server bases just moved around, I won’t play. A skilling area or skilling being a big part is a must. There can be no easy commands like ::pure, ::master, etc… Also, donation advantages is an instant turn-off. New gameframes/animations/models/etc are a no-go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It seems reasonable to get to the top of the hiscores. I don’t want to play on a 300 person private server where it would take me a solid week to even come close to the <span class="hashtag">#1</span> page. Relatively fast skilling would be best, and different ways to train stuff would be nice. The skilling has to be accurate for what it’s trying to do. There must be some sort of economy, and a ::yell command is really awesome when it’s done right and not limited by donations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well I’ve never donated and most likely never, ever will, but I must personally know the owner(s) and like them. They must have also done something to make my experience playing the server better. I have only come across one server where I would’ve donated had I the ability to.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>A good owner, no pay2win rewards, and realist prices.  I’m willing to give 10 or 15 dollars to a server I know will be up a couple months for a new skilling zone, but I’m not gonna give 25 dollars for full torva, korasi, and claws.[/quote]</p>
