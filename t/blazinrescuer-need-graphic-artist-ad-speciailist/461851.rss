[b]What we are?[/b]
[u]A remake in our own eyes [/u]
[code]This server is going to be the way I saw runescape. It is going to start slow, there is no bosses or rare drops in the game. Which will end up coming once the community grows. There is going to be holiday events, updates WILL happen weekly. Bugs will be fixed and suggestion will be taken into consideration.

Beta will count for those loyal players, they will get something for their achievements and support. same with any other player who puts the effort in, this sort of stuff wont be taken lightly like all servers.



This is how I saw runescape starting, at first there were only normal drops for a long time, then the game updated and you start seeing rare things. So, that is how I want this server turning out. I want it to mean something, In this server you can&#39;t get level cap and start farming and get full awesomeness armor in a week.

All of these things make this a unique experience for anyone who joins.[/code]
