    <title>Troubles with ints</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/troubles-with-ints/285715</link>
    <description>Hey, I have been attempting to edit the ints to make a spined helm just plain black. I have tried a couple of times, trying different things. But either way, I don&#39;t know the color ID for black. Plus, my item8.java doesn&#39;t have spined helm ints, only ints of new items. I am kind of clueless in client editing... so if any one has a link to a tutorial or something. any help would be appreciated.</description>
