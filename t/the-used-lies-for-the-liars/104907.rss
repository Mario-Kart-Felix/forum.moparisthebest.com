    <title>The used - lies for the liars</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-used-lies-for-the-liars/104907</link>
    <description>Hey i downloaded the new &quot;the used&quot; album the other day, i have to say it has definatly made it into my top 10 albums ever :). Just love the songs on it. I suggest people who are into rock in any way download it.
Some stuff on the album is soft and some is screaming... but what ever there is usually a song that you will like.

Just thought i&#39;d post and say about how this album is really good.</description>
