[b]Server IP:  glorica.minecraft.ms[/b]   or   [b]209.236.125.211[/b]

Hello, and welcome to[color=#33CCFF]Glorica!.[color=#000000]This is a young server that was created by Me(Gutbust) with help from my girlfriend(Celianna). I currently work full-time, but I spend as much time on the server as possible. I have  a steady income, so I can continue to pay for the server as long as i need to. Donations do help though, as all donations go towards upgrading the server with more RAM, HDD, ect.

[color=#33CCFF]Glorica is protected with plenty of plugins. We have WorldGuard, LWC, Factions, iConomy, LogBlock, NoCheatPlus, FoundDiamonds, and a few other plugins that are mainly for server protection. [color=#33CCFF][color=#000000][color=#33CCFF]We have Jobs that players can join. Use /jobs list to see a list of jobs to choose from, then use /jobs join JOBNAME to join that job. Players can have up to three jobs.

Quick video tour:

[color=#33CCFF]Glorica has many ranks, and is always growing and developing more ranks. Currenly we have:

Peasant: This is the rank you get when you first join the server (Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s easy to be promoted). This rank doesn&#39;t have the ability to build or warp.

Citizen:[color=#000000]This is the rank just after you accept the rules and are no longer a Peasant. At this rank you have the ability to use the warp list to warp to any of the biomes you want to build, and set 3 homes.

Noble:[color=#000000]  At this rank you have the ability to use the /fly command and you can now set 5 homes. You may also create a Faction of your own with the start-up fee of 50k coins. You can also use Falsebook&#39;s Bridges, Gates, ect.

[color=#006600]Craftsman: You can only get this rank if Celianna or Gutbust think that your buildings are unique and impressive. If you are lucky enough to obtain this rank, you will now have the ability to use the /item command for most building materials. You won&#39;t be able to spawn items such as Gems, ores, or other things. 

Noble+: This is the rank you get after you donate. There are three different donation amounts. The rank stays the same, but the permissions change for each amount.Visit the website to see more details.

[color=#33CCFF]KnightsWatch:[color=#000000] This is the equivalent of &quot;lowmod&quot; ranks that other servers have. It is chosen by the admins. at this rank you will be required to help other players throughout the game. Protected their lands, and helping them with griefs.

[color=#3333FF]KingsGuard:[color=#000000] This is the rank of &quot;highmod&quot;. Only the best KnightsWatch players will be able to get this rank.

[color=#FF6666]KingsHand:[color=#000000] There is only one of this rank, they have nearly every command possible. They are basically the headmods of the server. They control the lower mods and they must be listened to.

[color=#CC33CC]King/Queen:[color=#000000] These ar the owners of the server Gutbust and Celianna. You cannot obtain these ranks.

Rules:
[1] Use common sense
[2] No griefing
[3] Don&#39;t be a Douchebag
[4] Modified/Hacked clients aren&#39;t allowed
