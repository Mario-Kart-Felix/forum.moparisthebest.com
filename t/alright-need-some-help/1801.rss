    <description>ok well for the last 2 weeks ive been using mopars aryan and i dl his aryan updater. well today i log in and it says rs has been updated so i go and run the updater and everything updates no errors, so i try and run the run.bot and when i try to log in on all my accounts it says rs has been updated. now ive rerun the updater like 4 times to make sure of everything and ive retryed aryan like 4-8 times and still the same prob. what could be wrong and how could i fix this? (plz dont say im a noob and dont no what to do because ive just started the autoing bussiness and im not up on all the things like how to make ur own scripts but i do no somewhat on how to edit other scripts and stuff, and like all the different commands on aryan and stuff. i really only use it for lvling on noobs, then selling the ess i mine for rs gp and resell that for rl cash.)[br][size=1]Posted at: April 22, 2006, 11:15:52 am[/size][hr]up i need some help plz</description>
