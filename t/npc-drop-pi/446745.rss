    <description>There is a npc on my server and he drops a lot of stuff, one of the id is a 15300 which is a recover scpecial (4), but the npc is not in the NPCDrop.tsm. That is where i edit the drops but its not there, not even the drop id is there. So where can it be and the name of the npc is Lakharanaz. I also searched the name of it in the NPCDrop.tsm and its not there so where can it be?</description>
