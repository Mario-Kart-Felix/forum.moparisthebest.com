    <description>[size=15pt]How long do I have to wait!!!!!!!!!!! Why Can&#39;t AnyOne Fix My Problem![/size]

Note: By the way I have a normal router connecting to my [color=red]WIRELESS[/color] router.

Alright people, Heres how it is, I am using a Belkin wireless router, I Portforwarded (I think), I did the No-ip and made it a no-ip.biz one but I just can&#39;t log in, Can anyone and I mean anyone help me  :( :( :(

Note: I am on a Windows Vista computer

Thanks To Anyone Who Helps

Note: It seems I can not unblock the port, I port forwarded probly and everything but the port is still  BLOCKED!

Note: Okay, I found the problem, For some resond the port will not unblock, I have portforwarded did it all right and I added the port to my firewall and everything but still nothing works.

Tips On Newbyest Ways To Help: Add pictures, Don&#39;t use fancey java words or any fancey words for that matter, Explain it slowly and clearly.

I have uTorrent but I got it after I could not make a server also LimeWire is a theft program, if you enter your bank card they steal or your cash and they try to plant viruses into your programs. Avast detected a BIG virus from it when I scanned and I got from the offical site.</p>

<p>I think it’s gotta be a firewall or something which comes with vista, I thought it might of been AVG anti virus but it wasent that.</p>
<p>Errm, could I go team viewer with you and we can compare which programs we have what are the same, which could be causing the problem</p>
<p>EDIT :</p>
<p>My reamviewer ID is</p>
<p>340 595 283</p>

<p>Its seems like noone can fix it.<br>
I have had TWO people over  TeamViewer both that have made a server and not even they could fix it.<br>
They searched EVERYTHING!<br>
And they checked everything and it looked good but the port was still BLOCKED!<br>
Also are you using VISTA HOME edition?</p>
