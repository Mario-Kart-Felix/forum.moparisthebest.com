    <title>A Potentially Serious Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-potentially-serious-question/298475</link>
    <description>Ok, well this Christmas and my birthday, I&#39;m asking for only money. No games, no nerf guns (lol ^-^), and not even napster/itune cards. I&#39;m hoping to get $400+ in total. So if I get that much, what should I get? A new desktop computer, or an XBox 360? I would want the computer because mine right now (Dell Inspiron 1300) is a laptop with a useless battery, and is maybe 2-3 years old now. It has to be plugged in all the times, and even if you unplug it for not even a second it dies. I would want an XBox 360 because just about everyone I know has one, and I seriously want some of the games on it. :P Well what do you all think, desktop or XBox? Oh yea, if I got a desktop, it would only be the computer itself. I already have a monitor, mouse, and keyboard.</description>

And Lin, I’m only saying 400 because I’m sure I will get that overall. If absolutely everyone gives me money instead of gifts (including “Santa”), I should get a total more so around $650-$750.</p>

<p>And also, I don’t think you can get a really nice computer with only $400. If I were you, I’d just max out your ram, get the best video card you can, a fairly big hdd, and a sexy monitor.</p>
