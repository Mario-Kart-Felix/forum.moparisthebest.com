    <description>CreativeScape.

Is there a way to actually delete the Cache so people can download the client and just play?.
I am not making my Server 24/7 for a while.

I am also going to be deleting the MySQL. But how would i delete the Cache and make the Client work so you don&#39;t have to download Cache before playing the server.

Please help.</description>
