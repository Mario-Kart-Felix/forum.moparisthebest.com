    <title>Good homework help at popular Q/A websites</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/good-homework-help-at-popular-q-a-websites/273107</link>
    <description>Have you heard of [url=http://answers.yahoo.com]Yahoo! Answers[/url]? It&#39;s an amazing subsidiary of Yahoo! that has a point system which gives helpful people another incentive to answer questions for free. I post my calculus, chemistry, and electrical engineering questions and most, if not, all are answered. When you post, just be perfectly clear in what you&#39;re asking. If you&#39;re asking a math question with fractions, don&#39;t forget to use parenthesis or if you have to, draw out the picture and link to it in your question.

I&#39;m somewhat active in the math and chem sections mainly because it helps me with my studies when I help others. :)

              <p>Wiki Answers is by far not as good, but if you don’t find an answer to your question on Yahoo then it’s worth a try posting the question on Wiki Answers.</p>
