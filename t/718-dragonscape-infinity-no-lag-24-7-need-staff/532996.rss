DragonScape Infinity is a exciting brand new 718 server with many features here are just a few things that set us apart from other servers:

1st and foremost we listen to our players and develop DragonScape Infinity accordingly to their feedback and/or requests:

- We allow players who have programming skills to design their own content and submit it
to a ftp server

- If you dont have programming skills you may still make a request directly or submit it


2nd new players can always find help very fast and will not be ignored by staff:

- Staff is selected by who is the most useful to the server NOT who beggs the most this motivates many players to help newcomers

3rd DragonScape Infinity is part of a server network other servers being run in the network include:
- Team Fortress 2 Mvm
- Minecraft Tekkit Classic
- Ftp Server
- TeamSpeak 3 Server

4th DragonScape Infinity players have the option of using the teamspeak server for voice chat!

- Ip: TwilightNova.no-ip.biz

For those who opened this post because they wanted to be staff here are a few things you should know:

- Staff is chosen NOT requested make yourself a know part of the community and be helpful to all new players.
- Maturity matters not how old you are but how you choose to act.
- You will NOT be chosen if you continuously choose to fight with other players/staff.
- People who possess some kind of computer skill will have increased chances of being chosen for staff:	Graphics design, Animation, Codeing, Modeling, Web design
- People who help with the development of the server will have increased chances of being chosen for staff download the alpha client to help in development.
