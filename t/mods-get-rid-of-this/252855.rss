    <description>hey guys i was thinking about how to make a in-game point and click editor for the rs 317 client  :confused:

what i was thinking about was that you right click on something and say it comes up with its i.d and theres an option to deleate and place. you could do this with npcs/objects/items.

i dont no mutch java so thats why i posted this.
it would be a great help for beginners

moderators, plese dont lock this.
