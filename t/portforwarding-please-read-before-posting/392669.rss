    <description>Hey Guys,

I&#39;ve ran servers before with numerous amounts of players, But i want to run it on my new laptop and I&#39;ve port forwarded and it still isn&#39;t working. Then i thought i might try from my other computer which i ran all my other servers on and it isn&#39;t working. The servers aren&#39;t even working on the local host ports such as 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1. I&#39;m not sure why it isn&#39;t working I&#39;ve tried about 4 5 times and it still isn&#39;t working. please Post here and can someone please teamview me thanks.

I&#39;m really mine Boggled.</description>

Check the ip your putting in the client.java and also your ip might have changed over time and you may need to port forward again i know my computer does that sometimes so make sure your ip is the same go to the start menu and type cmd and hit enter then search ipconfig and if the ip you see doesnt match the one on your router then you will have to manually port forward instead of clicking on the comp name i had to do it also for my server is that doesnt work ill tv you to help you.</p>
