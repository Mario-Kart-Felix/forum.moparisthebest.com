    <description>Okay so, I have posted 2 other threads similar to this and gotten NO help whatsoever. 

I want to know what to replace the &quot;nulls&quot; with in my client.java and other parts of my server/source.

It would be GREATLY appreciated if someone could help with this or just tell me a good, clean, un-leeched source. Why do people all make leeched sources if people don&#39;t even know how to work java yet and they won&#39;t be able to because no sources are un-leeched. 

[b]HELP PLEASE! IF YOU DO I WILL MAKE YOU ADMIN ON MY SERVER ALTHOUGH I DOUBT ANYONE WILL CARE SO OBVIOUSLY YOU WON&#39;T HELP...[/b]</description>
