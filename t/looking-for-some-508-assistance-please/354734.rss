    <title>Looking for some [508] assistance please :)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-some-508-assistance-please/354734</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve decided I would move up from 317 to 508, and now I have 3 questions.
(Mithscape) by the way.

[s]1 - I&#39;ve read several tutorials on this, but I&#39;m looking for some help on how to edit the prices of items in shops, I changed something in Items.java, I believe, but that only changed the amount it tells you it&#39;s worth when you click &quot;Value&quot;. I&#39;m looking to change the actual price.[/s]
*Solved*
2 - I&#39;m also looking for a way to make players lose their items when they die, and I&#39;ve noticed a lot of other people are looking for this as well. 

3 - Anyone can attack anyone in the wilderness, how do I make the levels of the wilderness work properly, otherwise there&#39;s no sense in anyone making a pure if a 126 is going to come along and kill them with no problems.

Thanks for help in advance, Dave.</description>

              <p>Mine ended up being a bit different.</p>
<p>The actual prices were located in Items.cfg and the “Value” price was located in Items.java</p>
<p>Okay, so one problem down. Thanks for your help.</p>

              <p>you can edit the prices of shop items in PLAYER.JAVA,</p>
<p>you should see 3 options,  something like<br>
shop"number"<br>
shop"items"<br>

<p>u will need to edit the numbers in shop prices for eg.</p>
<p>public int[] shop3 = {1135, 1099, 1065, 2499, 2493,2487, 2501, 2495, 2489, 2503,2497, 2491, 10382, 10378, 10380, 10376, 10390, 10386, 10388, 10384, 10374, 10370, 10372, 10368,-1};<br>
public int[] shop3n = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1, 1, 1, 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1};<br>
