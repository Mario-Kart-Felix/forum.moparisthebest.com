              <p>First your gas prices isn’t high, move to Turkey if you want something to complain about.<br>
Second, your current health care system is expensive and inefficient.</p>
<p>Would you like a simple solution to the oil problem?<br>
Make oil the property of the government and just let governmental organizations drill for it (Of course you are creating one, and it will be easy to get workers since there isn’t any other companies on the marked). Only then you could take it out of the marked and only then a president could promise to lower the already ridiculous low prices. With global warming, high gas prices is actually good, this forces people to think more about the environment and either drive less or get more efficient cars. As technology brings the fuel-efficiency up, the actual price of driving goes down.</p>
<p>Back to your health-care: Just look at <span class="bbcode-b">any</span> other industrialized country and you would see a better system. The main problem with insurance is that the companies require profits. By cutting of the middle man you easily would save money, and you wouldn’t be denied health-care if the government did its job.</p>
<p>To all small government supporters:<br>

<p>Drilling domestically doesn’t really matter, unless the US decided to close their market to the rest of the world. The oil market is the most globalized market there is, and the prices are set globally. The government can raise the price through various forms of taxation, but I doubt the US has any form of gas tax other than the normal consumption tax.[/quote]<br>

<p>inb4 frell and/or “democrats take money too”, it just so happens that the right wing and republicans are the ones barking for smaller government and less government power, it’s a right wing thing by nature but it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s only the right wing jumping on the band wagon</p>

Yeah I heard when he was getting elected he was saying on the news “I promise I will Lower the price of gas” or something like that so, the gas prices are going up like 3c where I live its going up everyday. So I can’t drive anywhere without like paying 100$ worth of gas every other 3 weeks.</p>

<p>but for anyone out there who shares similar ignorant beliefs, the president cannot control gas prices and no energy policy changes (read: drill baby drill) will have any significant effect on gas prices, but considering for a minute if they did, gas is a globally traded commodity, you’d save a lot more selling it to another country than you would using it to reduce pump prices by a tiny bit</p>
