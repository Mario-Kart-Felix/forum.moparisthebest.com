I am surprised no-one has really found his fake and gay birth certificate.i heard that Donald Trump looked into it but i didn’t pay attention to what he found. To sum it all up: Obama is pretty much that one parent that spends to much money on the “credit card” and has racked too much debt…and hes Muslim.</p>

<p>we are capitalist not communist or socialists( names of economic systems not a form of government like a republic, oligarchy). if the business fails let it fail they dont need to be bailed out. its their fault, they spend to much money and made bad decisions. how many real people actually get a second chance like all those companies did? as far as i know nobody unless they have wealthy parents who will bail them out. the government is the parents of our economic system? no. the only role government needs to have with the economy is taxes, and printing the money. im sorry if ppl lose jobs b/c the company they work for went belly up. a company to the government is seen as a entity.</p>

<p>Yes, but if they didn’t bail the banks out, we would have been in a much bigger mess than we were in. The banks faulted during The Great Depression and people started asking for their money back all at once. The banks didn’t have enough money to cover everybody, so people loss their money. I can see where you are coming from, and you say that the government shouldn’t interfere with economical problems. Yes, for the most part they shouldn’t, but when it has the potential to put our country in great distress, I would like for them to step up and fix our mistakes. Maybe one day we will learn from our mistakes. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>instead of placing blame on presidents, blame the all current government officials, they are the ones who pass the budget bills, with the approval of the president. study and see how little say the president has on such matter. compare the federal government spending, and the income from taxes and stuff. <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7a/U.S._Federal_Spending_-_FY_2007.png/800px-U.S._Federal_Spending_-_FY_2007.png" alt><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f9/U.S._Federal_Receipts_-_FY_2007.png/800px-U.S._Federal_Receipts_-_FY_2007.png" alt></p>

</aside>
<p>You have a very valid point right there. I agree that the government officials have more influence on matters such as these. Although, as you stated, [quote=“xryz, post:23, topic:393494”]with the approval of the president[/quote] it can be led back to him. Am I saying everything is his fault? No, he could of been influenced badly by his Cabinet, or other individuals, but he also had the final say unless it goes to the Senate or some sort where they can overthrow his decision. I don’t remember the exact legalities of it. :o</p>
<p>[quote=“xryz, post:23, topic:393494”]about our jobs. clinton opened trade with china in the early 90’s. and offshore outsourcing needs to be stopped. yes we are helping other countries but we are being sucked dry. look here: <a href="http://www.uschina.org/statistics/tradetable.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.uschina.org/statistics/tradetable.html</a></p>
<p>as i stated above presidents have nothing to do with the economy since we are a capitalist(look it up if u dont know what that is) economy. really why are we going in to debt??? idk maybe giving china $200 billion a year couldnt be a reason. obama care? really has it help is it going to help? i think that was the largest waste of money ever. one good thing the global economy does is allows us to travel to another country and have our cash worth something there. but idk if thats worth giving out so much money each year.[/quote]<br>
Completely agree with this. Just companies being greedy with the cheap labor over there.</p>

<p>americans need to lower our cost of living and maybe we would have less people in poverty. actually teach ppl how to succeed in life at school. teach parents how to raise children, and create and enforce some law about postmarital sex. americans need to learn responsibility, by owning up to their actions.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You can’t exactly teach someone how to succeed in life. To succeed you need to have ambition and the will to succeed. Some people just don’t have this. There are classes that actually teach you on how to raise an infant, I have seen people walking around with fake babies in school. Most of the time when a parent has a child, their parents will give them tips on what to do and what not to do. When those people who have kids that were brought up in a dysfunctional family, they usually have issues raising their children. I am also against child day care. A child is never better off at a child day care center than at their home with their mother. I believe you mean premarital sex, not postmarital. Postmarital means afterwards.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyae52.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> If you created a law and enforced one about premarital sex, it would just cause kids to want to have sex more. Just a fact of human psychology. When you make something illegal, most kids will do it because it is illegal.</p>

<p>the way to grade a president and any political leader is to record what they said they will do and then see if they actually completed it. also look into the way our government works. they president has as much power as the rest of the branches. u may say but hes a single person. true. maybe that means they need to be more than one president at a time?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I personally believe the judicial branch has the most power. It is meant to be an equal system, though. And also the president is just a part of the executive branch, not a branch of its own. More president at one time? Maybe, but I feel there would be too many disagreements on what to do and such. Our system right now is one of the best there is, but it has its flaws like all the other government systems.</p>

<p>I have not read the article, but i will do so when I get more time. Also if I am understanding you correctly, it’s just getting rid of all of our taxes except for sales tax. Then essentially making sales tax more expensive. Wouldn’t this be the same thing as having multiple taxes if the revenue from the taxes stays the same?

<p>an idea my brother proposed is since every country is in debt why doesnt the country with least amount of debt erase its debt and subtract that off every other countries debt? that is a good idea. why not? the economy is based off of nothing. the value of the dollar is what ever u make it; meaning that a dollar is just a piece of cloth that the government tells its citizens that you can use this to trade for things you need. blah blah. dont believe me, look it up.</p>

<p>Hypothetically this should work, but there are greedy people in this world. I would be highly amazed if a country that was doing fine and had people owing them money would just tell the other countries, “You know what, we feel bad for you, so we will erase all of your debt so you can start from a clean slate and we basically gave you all of that money as a gift.”.

Hopefully your not implying that I am naive. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> If you have reason to believe so, then I would love to hear it though. What you say about the constitution is correct, as our country was based on (something similar to this): If the people of the United States of America are disagreeing on something being done as a whole, they can change it. This is to insure that what happened with Britain never happens in our country.</p>

<p>true but you can help them at early ages on different things, showing them how to enjoy life, trying to show them how to enjoy work and what not. if they grow up with positive energy, and outlook on life couldnt that help fuel them the rest of their life? i know about the classes for parents and stuff. with the parents telling their children how to raise their children may not be the best, especially if there was dysfunction(the help i was talking about was not just about parenting but also keeping a good functioning household. abuse, divorce and other similar issues need helped. families that have it right and others that have wisdom that will help families stay together and stuff, need to be more accessible to everyone. and with a 50% divorce rate that cant be good on families and the ones getting the divorce.), but it would hopefully be better than if the young parents had no experience or advice.</p>
<p>yes i meant pre not post the auto-correct did that. yes i know its human nature. possible if everyone was growing up as goody goodies then maybe they would follow that law? but penalties would include things such as first time overnight in jail, with a small fee, and only experientially increases from there. it maybe my opinion for that since i was raised christian, but it would save the world from lots of drama, and and unneeded pain and troubles that come from premarital sex. some ppl think it doesnt do anything to you but professionals that study the effects things have on humans say it does, and i would say the ppl that say it doesnt are only fooling themselves. how it would be enforced would take some thought.</p>
<p>it would be hard to enforce with current policies but if extra surveillance and security(cameras everywhere even in homes) was in place; even then it wouldnt be perfect(having the ability to monitor every action and thought someone has would, like chips implanted in everyone or what not; not trying to sound [cant think of the word] but those are proposed ideas to help rid the world of crime, be much closer to perfect though); but im sure that idea would not have very positive feedback from citizen, but that may happen in the far future when everyone is living in harmony, and peace with each other. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/confusedae52.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> would sure be nice if that was now though; at least the peace part.</p>

<p>yes the idea is the government is getting the same amount back for taxes, but ppl have more money to spend and there will be no need for the irs. more money as in u receive ur full pay check instead of a government drained one. so there for u have more money to buy things, possibly letting ppl have the ability to pay off debt, bills, and get insurance. u pay taxes every time u buy something. prices would increase much just a couple cents possibly, and if the government is needing a little bit more money from taxes they can increase it maybe a few percent which is just that many more pennies on every dollar. the cost of items would only increase a couple cents possibly because when u buy something u are paying the companies taxes; meaning that the company figures how much each product should cost with adding in some taxes they have to pay. so only having sales tax means that the companies will subtract that amount from the current prices.</p>

<p>I think me being tired affected me understanding that statement. Sorry, but yes, he should of been talking to congress, but I believe he was in Japan before the earthquake and tsunami happened, so therefore you can’t blame him for being at the wrong place when a disaster like that happened. If he flew over there while they were in turmoil that would be different.</p>
<p>Everything else I can’t really disagree on, because your arguments seem logical and make sense in my mind. I realize that my judgement on Bush was a bit hypercritical because of the situation he was put in.</p>
<p>[quote=“m.dog311, post:42, topic:393494”]All I saw was the highly retarded and opinionated “Obama hasn’t done shit, and it’s all Bush’s fault” argument that is never actually backed by anything.</p>

I do not see how you cannot see her being stubborn. She blatantly told me that she doesn’t like “keeping up with this kind of stuff” in her words. How can she provide arguments when she herself said she doesn’t even know exactly what is going on?</p>

Surely that's not a valid point, because if you asked someone back in the 1500's as I stated, everyone would tell you the world was flat. And also that the Earth was the center of the universe.

They say that it is the government's fault every single year. I know who she is listening to, and it is most likely kids talking about stuff they don't even know about. 
<p>Like this kid: [quote=“vexx1345, post:45, topic:393494”]Obama has been the worst president in U.S. history. He’s racked up the most debt, pissed off the most people, and done the most STUPID ASS things (healthcare bill anyone?). I am surprised no-one has really found his fake and gay birth certificate.i heard that Donald Trump looked into it but i didn’t pay attention to what he found. To sum it all up: Obama is pretty much that one parent that spends to much money on the “credit card” and has racked too much debt…and hes Muslim.[/quote]</p>
<p>Are you telling me she is putting up a good argument? I really don’t see it…</p>
<p>Edit: Sorry if some of that came out a bit rough, but some of the statements you typed really “yanked my chain” so to speak.</p>

        <p>I fully support you wanderer. I hate how people follow in the footsteps of selfish dumbass’s. Heck, i hope Trump runs for President so Obama gets an easier election. Also, with the termination of Osama bin Laden, he looks WAY better then Bush which may get him a few more people on his side. He has helped us is so many ways. I think that our country is so Arrogant. Sure, Osama bin Laden did deserve what he got, but it dosen’t mean we need to celebrate it. The night of his death i got atleast 6 phone calls and 50 texts telling my to watch the news. I though, “Great for America, al Quaeda’s primary leader is down, what about another one?” I told the callers good night and did not respond to the texts. Following that Sunday on Monday morning, i check facebook and atleast 85% of the posts were “Yay, Osama bin Laden is Dead! :D” I just though stfu… Yes it is fact that al Quaeda is declining, the majority of Middle Eastern residents either or don’t know who Osama bin Laden was and the 9/11 was. Osama did deserve justice, but we could of kept it on the down low… Now all the stereotypes other countries have on us for being arrogant are pretty much fact now… Pretty sad to live here sometimes. However, i am very greatful that i live in a country that can protect me…</p>

        <p>Listen, Obama is doing a great thing for you guys, here in Europe there is no such thing as poor, everyone has a minimal income,… It is all because of the RSZ. (RSZ is how we call it in Belgium). Basicly you get your money, they take 13.07% out of it for solidarity. And then after they take some other bills off it but that’s a different story. Basicly, lets say you earn €3000, if your a worker (work with them hands) they first turn that €3000 into 108% wich makes it €3240 and then take 13,07% out of that €3240 and the amount you get, €426 I think, is substracted from the original €3000. If you are a servant (work with them mind) they keep the €3000 and just take 13,07% out of it. Let’s say I’m a teacher, then they would take €392 out of my money. €2608 would be left. Out of that that amount depending on how much you earn, how many employees the company your working at has, what department your working at, if your married and wether your partner get’s a montly fee aswell. The amount of kids you have. Basicly, it can vary from €100 to €1000 for a standard income. Now lets say they take out another 800, I would only get payed €1800 on my bank. It sounds bad but it is good. When you get older, and you’ve worked for at least 20 years, you get like $1200 every month for doing nothing. People get money for their kids, we get €300 because of my brother and I and I mean if I had like a little sister as well that would turn into €700, if I had another brother we would get €1200. Again those are not the exact amounts but are close to the originals. Now, for the healt insurance, if you get sick, for example I got my tooth fixed last month, cost me €1000 euros, they payed us €956 back. If you’re out of work, they (the governement) pay you about €1200 a month untill you find a new job. If you’re sick and can’t work for 4 months, you still receive your money. Every year they give you money for going to vacation and etc etc, they say, you have to pay those bills on your income to help others, and when you need help, you will get that 2. That is the reason why Belgium as a VERY rich economy and that’s the reason why there most people can have a normal liveable life in Belgium. That’s also the reason why this year 100000 imigrants came in this country. (So did I in 98, came from Armenia, only problem there was, no insurancies, nothing, either your rich or your poor, thats how it is there. It was a former Sovjet country, everything was aranged by the Sovjet Union, we always worked with the Russians and it was great for the most people, everyone lived in peace but when the Sovjet quitted, rich motherfuckers took over the country and they took all the money from all the people. Also, the mafia, they work with the governement, isn’t that awesome. They fucked up our country fucking rich ass fat bastards.) You may wonder I’m only 16 and I know all this shit but that’s because last year I did ecenomics-math in the best higeschool in Belgium. But I had 46% for French so they gave me a B attest wich means you can eather move on to 4th grade in one level lower or you can do the year over. Since I was good with computers I went to a Software-Hardware Highscool and in here they give us 6 hours of economics each week. Next year that will turn into 2 hours and at the end of the year everyone gets a certificate that say we can open a company whenever we want no additional education whatsoever needed. However I’m going to get my college degree ofcourse in some hardcore programming (probably game development) and I’ll start a software company in about 6 years. Sorry for the bad grammar and spelling, I’ve learned my english from movies and runescape and programming and the internet in general. But runescape was my first source of english, my first word was noob, I didn’t actully now how to pronouce it because in Belgium they speak oo as a regular o like noeb, the o from potatOEs. Anyway back in topic, Obama sees that and wants that too. They want to have a social and help eachother aswell. You Americans are not use to all of this but soon enough you will get use to it and you won’t want to leave the system. Here in Belgium they even have an option to say no, I don’t want to pay health insurace but from 1000000 people 250 would make that choise. Remember this, now it’s health insurance, but I can imagine where this will go, evantually he will add more and more insurancies wich will make Americans normal again. Obama is the best thing that happend to you guys, you just don’t know it YET.</p>
