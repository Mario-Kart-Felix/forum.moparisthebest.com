        <p>This topic is about what you think about Obama’s presidency so far. Please don’t spout bullshit like my Girlfriend. I will post our discussion on the matter to show you how 90% of the population in America is… /fp</p>
<p>I started this conversation to try and enlighten her, but she’s too stubborn.</p>
<blockquote>Me: So what do you think about Obama's birth certificate and all of that?
<p>Annie: Well, he could of easily faked it.</p>
<p>Me: I find it absurd that our nation is worried about trivial matters such as this. Yes, he could of faked it… Chances are he didn’t though and when he was inaugurated they probably checked to see of he was born in the USA as it is required to become a president…</p>
</blockquote><br>
She then started talking about how he’s ruining the country by putting us in debt and he’s doing a terrible job. I told her about how we were in a great economical slump when he entered office, and that he inherited all of bush’s mess. She then asked me where did I hear that he’s making it better. She had to leave before I could respond so I texted her.
<blockquote>Me: We are no longer in an economical depression, the house market is better and houses aren't being repossessed as often, people are getting their jobs back, the stock market is rising. You don't need to hear it, you just have to look around and see it. He has helped out a lot since bush left the office. Ofcourse Obama is spending a lot, but that is because he inherited bush's mess. If you want hard solid facts that are backed up by data, not some bullshit opinions from a guy on the news I'll give them to you. Please babe, don't talk about something you don't know about... It makes you look like a fool when you talk to someone who knows what they are talking about...
<p>Annie: alright, do you know how stupid you’re making me sound? You’re telling me all this stuff and it sounds like you think you know everything. Ya know what? You prolly know just as much as me.</p>
<p>Me: oh really? <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> how much do you know?</p>
<p>Annie: if you keep this going were gonna get into a fight.</p>
<p>Me: alright. I won’t debate with you. Just please don’t talk to me about false stuff.</p>
<p>Annie: oh. Jeez… Baby I’m sorry…</p>
<p>Me: it’s alright. Love you. &lt;3</p>
<p>Annie: you know what I mean though? It sounds as if you think I’m a stupid person that you can just brush off… I know I’m stupid, by I know a little about what’s going on. Not just in politics, but I’m an observant person.</p>
<p>Me: I know your smart, but you were spouting informationand misleaded opinions.</p>
<p>Annie: I was saying that he hasn’t made things better. Maybe the facts say he has, but I’ve heard WAY more people who actually deal with it say he hasn’t helped. Ok I’m done fuming now <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>This law that I state actually does exist. I can’t remember who coined it or what it was called, but I read about it being referenced in a magazine.</p>
<p>Me: theres a law that says one who foams at the mouth in a debate knows the least. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> who are you hearing that from may I ask?</p>
<p>Annie: really? Really AJ? I don’t wanna get into this… I’ve heard that from everybody. Every single person that’s talked about how tough they have it 'cause of money says something about the gov./obama being at fault. I know EXACTLY what you’re thinking AJ, and no, this isn’t just my parents and Ryan [her older brother at the age of 18] saying that. Wow. Thanks so much.</p>
<p>Me: exactly. 90% [bullshit estimation, but probably accurate] of people will tell you that because they don’t understand and are being brainwashed by the news… Fine don’t listen to me. Listen to channel 5.</p>
<p>Annie: AJ. When you go into debt up to your eyeballs from this stuff then you can tell me how much I don’t know. And stop acting like I dont know anything about what I’m talking about! I HATE that.</p>
<p>Me: alright fine. Your right I’m wrong. You don’t even seem to listen to what in saying. Love you.</p>

<p>She is a prime example of the majority of people in America. Next presidency she will complain about the next president. I personally don’t think he’s doing that bad of a job. Also it matters what point of view you are looking at. It is hard to see how his decisions will effect us in the present, but as far as handling the economical problems, he’s doing a decent, if not good, job.</p>
<p>I posted this on my iPod sorry for any grammatical errors. Forgot to mention, in the beginning I asked her how is he hurting us and she said I don’t know, I don’t really keep track of that kind of stuff. Then i asked her how possibly could she say that I am wrong then? And that majority of the people thing she has going on is bullshit. Majority of the people back in the 1500s thought the world was flat.</p>

Well lets see, he sped up our debt reaching by 3 years by spending $2.9T, more than all the presidents combined, he went golfing when Japan was hit by an earthquake, he hasn’t even been a leader, he doesnt speak up during government votes, he stalled the action in Libya and innocent protestors were killed by Gaddafi’s forces etc etc etc.</p>

Oh and if you actually clicked that link you’d see it supports him. Most of it is just little stuff with him trying to save everyone by nerfing the free market. Sure its helpful but he shouldn’t be doing it RIGHT NOW, he’ll endup running credit card and insurance companies into the ground. Banks will need to raise interest because they can’t make as much money as they used to. If these companies are hurt or fail it could mean hundreds of thousands more out of work. All of these things are prime chunks of our economy. And some of the policies are from deals with republicans. The same thing happened to Clinton, he was dragged kicking and screaming to pass laws he didn’t want passed, and once it had a positive impact he stood and spoke and took all of the credit.

First off I would like to state that I still believe the reason Obama has put us in so much debt is with Bush. I would love for you to post where you got that information from because a lot of it is controversial in my mind. Especially with the stimulus package not working. I am seeing the effects myself, not listening to some reporter state some bullshit facts/data. If you look around you will realize that there aren’t many houses foreclosed anymore. Not saying you are wrong, just saying i highly doubt it was ineffective as you make it to seem. And really I don’t blame bush for starting the economical mess we had, but he sure as hell didn’t help the situation. Personally I think he should never of been in the office… Correct me if I am wrong, since bush’s presidency was 3 years ago, but I’m pretty sure I remember Joe Biden using bush like a puppet. And Joe Biden I believe also held use shares or of the same nature in oil companies and greatly profited from bushs presidency. (Sorry for iPod errors and such.)</p>
<p>Most of your arguments are valid. Except for the one that he has spent more than all of the presidents combined. That seems a bit far fetched. My point is, is that most people don’t even know what they are talking about and will argue with you intensely about it. Your not a fool, and have done some research of your own, which I applaud. I would like to see where your getting all of it first to make sure you didn’t accidentally exaggerate something. And, yes, I may turn my head to some of the mistakes that he makes, but it’s not that I am turning my head and ignoring it. It is more of the fact that he is our president and he will be for two years. He isn’t doing the best job as far as you can tell at the moment and he isn’t doing the worst. I’m pretty sure you can name presidents who were worse than him. How exactly does him golfing in japan while it was hit with an earthquake have to do anything? And usually businessman talk over matters and agreements while they golf. I just fail to see what your point is in that statement.</p>
