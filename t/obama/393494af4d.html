        <p>[quote=‚ÄúRiiPiiNFtW, post:79, topic:393494‚Äù]I fully support you wanderer. I hate how people follow in the footsteps of selfish dumbass‚Äôs. Heck, i hope<br>
Trump runs for President so Obama gets an easier election. Also, with the termination of Osama bin Laden, he<br>
looks WAY better then Bush which may get him a few more people on his side. He has helped us is so many ways. I<br>
think that our country is so Arrogant. Sure, Osama bin Laden did deserve what he got, but it dosen‚Äôt mean we<br>
need to celebrate it. The night of his death i got atleast 6 phone calls and 50 texts telling my to watch the<br>
news. I though, ‚ÄúGreat for America, al Quaeda‚Äôs primary leader is down, what about another one?‚Äù I told the<br>
callers good night and did not respond to the texts. Following that Sunday on Monday morning, i check facebook<br>
and atleast 85% of the posts were ‚ÄúYay, Osama bin Laden is Dead! :D‚Äù I just though stfu‚Ä¶ Yes it is fact that<br>
al Quaeda is declining, the majority of Middle Eastern residents either or don‚Äôt know who Osama bin Laden was<br>
and the 9/11 was. Osama did deserve justice, but we could of kept it on the down low‚Ä¶ Now all the stereotypes<br>
other countries have on us for being arrogant are pretty much fact now‚Ä¶ Pretty sad to live here sometimes.<br>
However, i am very greatful that i live in a country that can protect me‚Ä¶[/quote]</p>
<p>yes i too hope trump runs so he is elected b/c if he runs he has my vote. and no it wont make it easier on<br>
obama if he runs, i dont understand why u think it would. and the fact him being ‚Äúblack‚Äù isnt going to help<br>
since there are other black ppl running in 2012(one being <a href="http://newsone.com/nation/newsonestaff2/black-republican-announces-run-for-2012-presidency/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://newsone.com/nation/newsonestaff2/black-<br>
republican-announces-run-for-2012-presidency/</a>). and the death of osama shouldnt effect how he looks to<br>
the public like i mentioned on another thread that obama doesnt really need any praise for it since he did<br>
nothing. i see what u mean about the stereotypes for american and stuff with the osama stuff, to let you know i<br>
wasnt celibrating i was just like well thats nice, whats next?</p>
<p>[quote=‚ÄúMistaBigBoss, post:80, topic:393494‚Äù]Listen, Obama is doing a great thing for you guys, here in Europe there is no such thing as poor, everyone has<br>
a minimal income,‚Ä¶ It is all because of the RSZ. (RSZ is how we call it in Belgium). Basicly you get your<br>
money, they take 13.07% out of it for solidarity. And then after they take some other bills off it but that‚Äôs a<br>
different story. Basicly, lets say you earn ‚Ç¨3000, if your a worker (work with them hands) they first turn that<br>
‚Ç¨3000 into 108% wich makes it ‚Ç¨3240 and then take 13,07% out of that ‚Ç¨3240 and the amount you get, ‚Ç¨426 I<br>
think, is substracted from the original ‚Ç¨3000. If you are a servant (work with them mind) they keep the ‚Ç¨3000<br>
and just take 13,07% out of it. Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm a teacher, then they would take ‚Ç¨392 out of my money. ‚Ç¨2608 would<br>
be left. Out of that that amount depending on how much you earn, how many employees the company your working at<br>
has, what department your working at, if your married and wether your partner get‚Äôs a montly fee aswell. The<br>
amount of kids you have. Basicly, it can vary from ‚Ç¨100 to ‚Ç¨1000 for a standard income. Now lets say they take<br>
out another 800, I would only get payed ‚Ç¨1800 on my bank. It sounds bad but it is good. When you get older, and<br>
you‚Äôve worked for at least 20 years, you get like $1200 every month for doing nothing. People get money for<br>
their kids, we get ‚Ç¨300 because of my brother and I and I mean if I had like a little sister as well that would<br>
turn into ‚Ç¨700, if I had another brother we would get ‚Ç¨1200. Again those are not the exact amounts but are<br>
close to the originals. Now, for the healt insurance, if you get sick, for example I got my tooth fixed last<br>
month, cost me ‚Ç¨1000 euros, they payed us ‚Ç¨956 back. If you‚Äôre out of work, they (the governement) pay you<br>
about ‚Ç¨1200 a month untill you find a new job. If you‚Äôre sick and can‚Äôt work for 4 months, you still receive<br>
your money. Every year they give you money for going to vacation and etc etc, they say, you have to pay those<br>
bills on your income to help others, and when you need help, you will get that 2. That is the reason why<br>
Belgium as a VERY rich economy and that‚Äôs the reason why there most people can have a normal liveable life in<br>
Belgium. That‚Äôs also the reason why this year 100000 imigrants came in this country. (So did I in 98, came from<br>
Armenia, only problem there was, no insurancies, nothing, either your rich or your poor, thats how it is there.<br>
It was a former Sovjet country, everything was aranged by the Sovjet Union, we always worked with the Russians<br>
and it was great for the most people, everyone lived in peace but when the Sovjet quitted, rich motherfuckers<br>
took over the country and they took all the money from all the people. Also, the mafia, they work with the<br>
governement, isn‚Äôt that awesome. They fucked up our country fucking rich ass fat bastards.) You may wonder I‚Äôm<br>
only 16 and I know all this shit but that‚Äôs because last year I did ecenomics-math in the best higeschool in<br>
Belgium. But I had 46% for French so they gave me a B attest wich means you can eather move on to 4th grade in<br>
one level lower or you can do the year over. Since I was good with computers I went to a Software-Hardware<br>
Highscool and in here they give us 6 hours of economics each week. Next year that will turn into 2 hours and at<br>
the end of the year everyone gets a certificate that say we can open a company whenever we want no additional<br>
education whatsoever needed. However I‚Äôm going to get my college degree ofcourse in some hardcore programming<br>
(probably game development) and I‚Äôll start a software company in about 6 years. Sorry for the bad grammar and<br>
spelling, I‚Äôve learned my english from movies and runescape and programming and the internet in general. But<br>
runescape was my first source of english, my first word was noob, I didn‚Äôt actully now how to pronouce it<br>
because in Belgium they speak oo as a regular o like noeb, the o from potatOEs. Anyway back in topic, Obama<br>
sees that and wants that too. They want to have a social and help eachother aswell. You Americans are not use<br>
to all of this but soon enough you will get use to it and you won‚Äôt want to leave the system. Here in Belgium<br>
they even have an option to say no, I don‚Äôt want to pay health insurace but from 1000000 people 250 would make<br>
that choise. Remember this, now it‚Äôs health insurance, but I can imagine where this will go, evantually he will<br>
add more and more insurancies wich will make Americans normal again. Obama is the best thing that happend to<br>
you guys, you just don‚Äôt know it YET.[/quote]</p>
<p>note: i understand english isnt your native tongue, but making paragraphs would be nice it so the sentences dont look like they are running together.</p>
<p>if i understand right thats better than the us, if thats what ur saying. a problem with the us is that the<br>
government gives them the choice if they do their duty or not. it shouldnt be a choice everyone should have to<br>
do it. if every american worked together to better the country instead of being lazy and ignorant(knowing that<br>
every american that has the ability to make america better, has a part in doing so), then america would be way<br>
better.</p>
<p>does anyone know how hard it would be to start a new state(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State</a>, meaning country<br>
not like a state of the united states)? it would be nice to start a new country, make laws, and have the laws<br>
understandable. there would have to be a lot of planning that would go into that, but im pretty sure we would<br>
have protection from large countries, at least until that country was able to defend itself. the system would<br>
be designed to have a flow of cash, no cash flow and cash flow going out != to the flow coming in are both bad<br>
for economy(common sense though).</p>

<p>i was only 17 so couldnt vote, and i know that is a big reason why. ignorance and racism yes that is racist to<br>
vote for someone mearly based on race. american white males have to deal with a lot now a day b/c of our<br>
fathers and grandfather generations, meaning that american white males can get judged over things that if a<br>
female ore person of another race did they they wouldnt be considered racist or sexist. just saying. everyone<br>
wanting equalality bs they just want to be on top and dont really care where everyone else is. we need to end<br>
the non-sense of racism and being sexist(there are ladies that are, yet you really never see anyone say a female is being sexist. u only see men being sexist.)</p>
<p>about the the economy, if u took a class for it you should know that the economy goes through drops and rises b/c the economy has a cycle it follows. if u look here(<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://charting.nasdaq.com/ext/charts.dll?2-1-14-0-0-354-03NA000000COMP-&amp;SF:40%7C41%7C42-HC=0" title="charts.dll?2-1-14-0-0-354-03NA000000COMP-&amp;amp;SF:40%7C41%7C42-HC=0" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://charting.nasdaq.com/ext/charts.dll?2-1-14-0-0-354-03NA000000COMP-&amp;SF:40%7C41%7C42-HC=0" alt width="500" height="500"><div class="meta">

Because us humans, we are in no way perfect and we always make mistakes. Let people take care of themselves and everything will be fucked up, chaos,‚Ä¶, you saw the movies. Gangs taking over of people,‚Ä¶ That is why people need direction and for a rich economy everyone has to be a part of it and has to help eachother out because that is the solution to almost most problems. And don‚Äôt think health insurance is not something good. The most important thing in life, above everything else is health. You need to be healthy to be able to live a normal life. Imagine what would happen if you got sick and you had to be put in hospital for a month. That would cost you A LOT of money and you probably would end up selling your house because you wouldn‚Äôt be able to pay it off. With health insurace you don‚Äôt have to be resposible for the money you have to pay and don‚Äôt have to worry for getting sick.</p>

I fully support you wanderer. I hate how people follow in the footsteps of selfish dumbass‚Äôs. Heck, i hope<br>
Trump runs for President so Obama gets an easier election. Also, with the termination of Osama bin Laden, he<br>
looks WAY better then Bush which may get him a few more people on his side. He has helped us is so many ways. I<br>
think that our country is so Arrogant. Sure, Osama bin Laden did deserve what he got, but it dosen‚Äôt mean we<br>
need to celebrate it. The night of his death i got atleast 6 phone calls and 50 texts telling my to watch the<br>
news. I though, ‚ÄúGreat for America, al Quaeda‚Äôs primary leader is down, what about another one?‚Äù I told the<br>
callers good night and did not respond to the texts. Following that Sunday on Monday morning, i check facebook<br>
and atleast 85% of the posts were ‚ÄúYay, Osama bin Laden is Dead! :D‚Äù I just though stfu‚Ä¶ Yes it is fact that<br>
al Quaeda is declining, the majority of Middle Eastern residents either or don‚Äôt know who Osama bin Laden was<br>
and the 9/11 was. Osama did deserve justice, but we could of kept it on the down low‚Ä¶ Now all the stereotypes<br>
other countries have on us for being arrogant are pretty much fact now‚Ä¶ Pretty sad to live here sometimes.<br>
However, i am very greatful that i live in a country that can protect me‚Ä¶<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>yes i too hope trump runs so he is elected b/c if he runs he has my vote. and no it wont make it easier on<br>
obama if he runs, i dont understand why u think it would. and the fact him being ‚Äúblack‚Äù isnt going to help<br>
since there are other black ppl running in 2012(one being <a href="http://newsone.com/nation/newsonestaff2/black-republican-announces-run-for-2012-presidency/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://newsone.com/nation/newsonestaff2/black-<br>
republican-announces-run-for-2012-presidency/</a>). and the death of osama shouldnt effect how he looks to<br>
the public like i mentioned on another thread that obama doesnt really need any praise for it since he did<br>
nothing. i see what u mean about the stereotypes for american and stuff with the osama stuff, to let you know i<br>
wasnt celibrating i was just like well thats nice, whats next?</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Listen, Obama is doing a great thing for you guys, here in Europe there is no such thing as poor, everyone has<br>
a minimal income,‚Ä¶ It is all because of the RSZ. (RSZ is how we call it in Belgium). Basicly you get your<br>
money, they take 13.07% out of it for solidarity. And then after they take some other bills off it but that‚Äôs a<br>
different story. Basicly, lets say you earn ‚Ç¨3000, if your a worker (work with them hands) they first turn that<br>
‚Ç¨3000 into 108% wich makes it ‚Ç¨3240 and then take 13,07% out of that ‚Ç¨3240 and the amount you get, ‚Ç¨426 I<br>
think, is substracted from the original ‚Ç¨3000. If you are a servant (work with them mind) they keep the ‚Ç¨3000<br>
and just take 13,07% out of it. Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm a teacher, then they would take ‚Ç¨392 out of my money. ‚Ç¨2608 would<br>
be left. Out of that that amount depending on how much you earn, how many employees the company your working at<br>
has, what department your working at, if your married and wether your partner get‚Äôs a montly fee aswell. The<br>
amount of kids you have. Basicly, it can vary from ‚Ç¨100 to ‚Ç¨1000 for a standard income. Now lets say they take<br>
out another 800, I would only get payed ‚Ç¨1800 on my bank. It sounds bad but it is good. When you get older, and<br>
you‚Äôve worked for at least 20 years, you get like $1200 every month for doing nothing. People get money for<br>
their kids, we get ‚Ç¨300 because of my brother and I and I mean if I had like a little sister as well that would<br>
turn into ‚Ç¨700, if I had another brother we would get ‚Ç¨1200. Again those are not the exact amounts but are<br>
close to the originals. Now, for the healt insurance, if you get sick, for example I got my tooth fixed last<br>
month, cost me ‚Ç¨1000 euros, they payed us ‚Ç¨956 back. If you‚Äôre out of work, they (the governement) pay you<br>
about ‚Ç¨1200 a month untill you find a new job. If you‚Äôre sick and can‚Äôt work for 4 months, you still receive<br>
your money. Every year they give you money for going to vacation and etc etc, they say, you have to pay those<br>
bills on your income to help others, and when you need help, you will get that 2. That is the reason why<br>
Belgium as a VERY rich economy and that‚Äôs the reason why there most people can have a normal liveable life in<br>
Belgium. That‚Äôs also the reason why this year 100000 imigrants came in this country. (So did I in 98, came from<br>
Armenia, only problem there was, no insurancies, nothing, either your rich or your poor, thats how it is there.<br>
It was a former Sovjet country, everything was aranged by the Sovjet Union, we always worked with the Russians<br>
and it was great for the most people, everyone lived in peace but when the Sovjet quitted, rich motherfuckers<br>
took over the country and they took all the money from all the people. Also, the mafia, they work with the<br>
governement, isn‚Äôt that awesome. They fucked up our country fucking rich ass fat bastards.) You may wonder I‚Äôm<br>
only 16 and I know all this shit but that‚Äôs because last year I did ecenomics-math in the best higeschool in<br>
Belgium. But I had 46% for French so they gave me a B attest wich means you can eather move on to 4th grade in<br>
one level lower or you can do the year over. Since I was good with computers I went to a Software-Hardware<br>
Highscool and in here they give us 6 hours of economics each week. Next year that will turn into 2 hours and at<br>
the end of the year everyone gets a certificate that say we can open a company whenever we want no additional<br>
education whatsoever needed. However I‚Äôm going to get my college degree ofcourse in some hardcore programming<br>
(probably game development) and I‚Äôll start a software company in about 6 years. Sorry for the bad grammar and<br>
spelling, I‚Äôve learned my english from movies and runescape and programming and the internet in general. But<br>
runescape was my first source of english, my first word was noob, I didn‚Äôt actully now how to pronouce it<br>
because in Belgium they speak oo as a regular o like noeb, the o from potatOEs. Anyway back in topic, Obama<br>
sees that and wants that too. They want to have a social and help eachother aswell. You Americans are not use<br>
to all of this but soon enough you will get use to it and you won‚Äôt want to leave the system. Here in Belgium<br>
they even have an option to say no, I don‚Äôt want to pay health insurace but from 1000000 people 250 would make<br>
that choise. Remember this, now it‚Äôs health insurance, but I can imagine where this will go, evantually he will<br>
add more and more insurancies wich will make Americans normal again. Obama is the best thing that happend to<br>
you guys, you just don‚Äôt know it YET.</p>

<p>note: i understand english isnt your native tongue, but making paragraphs would be nice it so the sentences dont look like they are running together.</p>
<p>if i understand right thats better than the us, if thats what ur saying. a problem with the us is that the<br>
government gives them the choice if they do their duty or not. it shouldnt be a choice everyone should have to<br>
do it. if every american worked together to better the country instead of being lazy and ignorant(knowing that<br>
every american that has the ability to make america better, has a part in doing so), then america would be way<br>
better.</p>
<p>does anyone know how hard it would be to start a new state(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State</a>, meaning country<br>
not like a state of the united states)? it would be nice to start a new country, make laws, and have the laws<br>
understandable. there would have to be a lot of planning that would go into that, but im pretty sure we would<br>
have protection from large countries, at least until that country was able to defend itself. the system would<br>
be designed to have a flow of cash, no cash flow and cash flow going out != to the flow coming in are both bad<br>
for economy(common sense though).</p>

<p>i was only 17 so couldnt vote, and i know that is a big reason why. ignorance and racism yes that is racist to<br>
vote for someone mearly based on race. american white males have to deal with a lot now a day b/c of our<br>
fathers and grandfather generations, meaning that american white males can get judged over things that if a<br>
female ore person of another race did they they wouldnt be considered racist or sexist. just saying. everyone<br>
wanting equalality bs they just want to be on top and dont really care where everyone else is. we need to end<br>
the non-sense of racism and being sexist(there are ladies that are, yet you really never see anyone say a female is being sexist. u only see men being sexist.)</p>

<p>we are a republic‚Ä¶[/quote]That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying, I‚Äôm saying you guys should learn to take care of yourselves, help eachother WITHIN the United States of America. You wanna know what economical problems there are in Belgium? Basicly people get to old and they die to late and they use the resources of Belgium. And there are to few young people for the next generation of working people.</p>

<p>As you can see, in about 15 years, there won‚Äôt be enough working people and to much old people = fail. This diagam should look like a pyramid in every country to speak of a healthy country.</p>
<p>That is almost all the problems we have here, so in my POV, this system of helping eachother is really working well.</p>

        <p>Again I ask, ‚ÄúHave you had a better life since he has been in office?‚Äù If the answer is no then why would you vote for him again. He‚Äôs an idiot who has added lots of taxes and has raised oil prices. He is not the only one responsible for the high oil prices. It is partly the speculators. In 08 when bush was president a barrel of oil was as high as $180. Now it is around $110 but cause of fucking Obama and the other idiots in the government the price of gas is still the same.</p>
