<p>Honestly hes thinking about today not tommorrow. Yeah we can do this cash for clunkers program but then we can ship all the cars to china and they can be melted into metal! This way when teenagers or low-class people need to go out and buy a vehicle there will be less used cars avaliable, we are fucking genius. Then we once we have war with china they can take all that metal make it into bullets and start shooting it back at us, same thing happened to us in WW2.</p>

<p>Yea, sure. China has enough metal, they don’t need US metal if they want to make ammunition.</p>
<p>The cash for clunkers program is stimulating the economy, which is what it was supposed to do. Even if Americans only buy Japanese cars, the US economy still gets stimulated.</p>

It didn’t work as expected, they were hoping for people to jump on the deals and start buying new cars everywhere, but they didn’t. Like i said, it DID stimulate car sales… In Japan.</p>

<p>They all went after Toyota more than any other car retailers.</p>
<p>EDIT: You’re right. They did reach their budget and end the program, but it had no effect because like i said, they went after Toyota and Honda the most and it had little effect on American car companies.</p>

</aside>
<p>It depends on what you expect from it. If you expected that everyone was going to buy American cars, then it didn’t go as expected. Only 2 Ford models are in the top-10. But if you look at the ‘clunkers’ that were traded in, you see that they all were heavy polluters. So this program was great for the environment.</p>
<p>Selling Japanese cars is still selling cars. A lot of company’s profit from selling cars. The dealers do, but the logistic system that takes care of the transport of the cars from Japan to the dealership profits from it too.</p>
<p>In the end, I think that there may have been better programs that could’ve used the money, but it isn’t money wasted.</p>

It didn’t work as expected, they were hoping for people to jump on the deals and start buying new cars everywhere, but they didn’t. Like i said, it DID stimulate car sales… In Japan.<br>

<p>It depends on what you expect from it. If you expected that everyone was going to buy American cars, then it didn’t go as expected. Only 2 Ford models are in the top-10. But if you look at the ‘clunkers’ that were traded in, you see that they all were heavy polluters. So this program was great for the environment.</p>
<p>Selling Japanese cars is still selling cars. A lot of company’s profit from selling cars. The dealers do, but the logistic system that takes care of the transport of the cars from Japan to the dealership profits from it too.</p>
<p>In the end, I think that there may have been better programs that could’ve used the money, but it isn’t money wasted.[/quote]<br>
It did boost sales but not as much as expected, so yes it somewhat worked. And yes it was good for the environment. It would have worked a lot better if they bought American cars though, everyone prefers foreign cars but Ford is really jumping themselves up with their new cars, so they might come back into competition.</p>

Its not a scam…Its true. More greenhouse gases = warmer earth.</p>
<p>Warmer earth = polar ice caps melt, and our water levels rise. also: the earth gets hotter, causing major droughts in areas, and can lead up to forest fires…</p>
<p>not really a scam, more like common sense.</p>

Maybe that could be possible, but no major scientific bodies reject human influence on climate change, and that makes it seem extremely unlikely.</p>

Green house gases still heat the earth, scientist have found a 1 degree temp change (1 degree is semi-major) and why not go “green”? Cleaner air, less noise (as in electric powered cars), and much cheaper (in the long run).</p>
<p>Also, sauce on temp. change: <a href="http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/gw-overview.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/gw-overview.html</a> , <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/12/1206_041206_global_warming.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/12/1206_041206_global_warming.html</a></p>
<p>it says in one of those articles, and I think scientist that work for national geographic would joke around with this.</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<blockquote>Called greenhouse gases, their levels are higher now than in the last 650,000 years</blockquote>
<p>Yes, there is a cycle maybe, but the temp. cycle is higher then usual.</p>
<p>Anyways, we should get back on topic about Obama.</p>

What proof do you have of this… because like I said, [quote author=cooper link=topic=382801.msg2943071#msg2943071 date=1252024503]<br>
no major scientific bodies reject human influence on climate change</p>
