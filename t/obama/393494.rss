    <description>This topic is about what you think about Obama&#39;s presidency so far. Please don&#39;t spout bullshit like my Girlfriend. I will post our discussion on the matter to show you how 90% of the population in America is... /fp

I started this conversation to try and enlighten her, but she&#39;s too stubborn.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Me: So what do you think about Obama&#39;s birth certificate and all of that?

Annie: Well, he could of easily faked it.

Me: I find it absurd that our nation is worried about trivial matters such as this. Yes, he could of faked it... Chances are he didn&#39;t though and when he was inaugurated they probably checked to see of he was born in the USA as it is required to become a president...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
She then started talking about how he&#39;s ruining the country by putting us in debt and he&#39;s doing a terrible job. I told her about how we were in a great economical slump when he entered office, and that he inherited all of bush&#39;s mess. She then asked me where did I hear that he&#39;s making it better. She had to leave before I could respond so I texted her.


&lt;blockquote&gt;Me: We are no longer in an economical depression, the house market is better and houses aren&#39;t being repossessed as often, people are getting their jobs back, the stock market is rising. You don&#39;t need to hear it, you just have to look around and see it. He has helped out a lot since bush left the office. Ofcourse Obama is spending a lot, but that is because he inherited bush&#39;s mess. If you want hard solid facts that are backed up by data, not some bullshit opinions from a guy on the news I&#39;ll give them to you. Please babe, don&#39;t talk about something you don&#39;t know about... It makes you look like a fool when you talk to someone who knows what they are talking about...

Annie: alright, do you know how stupid you&#39;re making me sound? You&#39;re telling me all this stuff and it sounds like you think you know everything. Ya know what? You prolly know just as much as me.

Me: oh really? :P how much do you know?

Annie: if you keep this going were gonna get into a fight.

Me: alright. I won&#39;t debate with you. Just please don&#39;t talk to me about false stuff.

Annie: oh. Jeez... Baby I&#39;m sorry...

Me: it&#39;s alright. Love you. &lt;3

Annie: you know what I mean though? It sounds as if you think I&#39;m a stupid person that you can just brush off...... I know I&#39;m stupid, by I know a little about what&#39;s going on. Not just in politics, but I&#39;m an observant person.

Me: I know your smart, but you were spouting informationand misleaded opinions.

Annie: I was saying that he hasn&#39;t made things better. Maybe the facts say he has, but I&#39;ve heard WAY more people who actually deal with it say he hasn&#39;t helped. Ok I&#39;m done fuming now :P

This law that I state actually does exist. I can&#39;t remember who coined it or what it was called, but I read about it being referenced in a magazine.

Me: theres a law that says one who foams at the mouth in a debate knows the least. ;) who are you hearing that from may I ask?

Annie: really? Really AJ? I don&#39;t wanna get into this... I&#39;ve heard that from everybody. Every single person that&#39;s talked about how tough they have it &#39;cause of money says something about the gov./obama being at fault. I know EXACTLY what you&#39;re thinking AJ, and no, this isn&#39;t just my parents and Ryan [her older brother at the age of 18] saying that. Wow. Thanks so much.

Me: exactly. 90% [bullshit estimation, but probably accurate] of people will tell you that because they don&#39;t understand and are being brainwashed by the news... Fine don&#39;t listen to me. Listen to channel 5.

Annie: AJ. When you go into debt up to your eyeballs from this stuff then you can tell me how much I don&#39;t know. And stop acting like I dont know anything about what I&#39;m talking about! I HATE that.

Me: alright fine. Your right I&#39;m wrong. You don&#39;t even seem to listen to what in saying. Love you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


She is a prime example of the majority of people in America. Next presidency she will complain about the next president. I personally don&#39;t think he&#39;s doing that bad of a job. Also it matters what point of view you are looking at. It is hard to see how his decisions will effect us in the present, but as far as handling the economical problems, he&#39;s doing a decent, if not good, job. 

I posted this on my iPod sorry for any grammatical errors. Forgot to mention, in the beginning I asked her how is he hurting us and she said I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t really keep track of that kind of stuff. Then i asked her how possibly could she say that I am wrong then? And that majority of the people thing she has going on is bullshit. Majority of the people back in the 1500s thought the world was flat.</description>

<p>its ok. i looked on wikipedia and yes it use to be “democratic republic of vietnam”(from '54 to '76), but now it is “socialist republic of vietnam”. i would talk to ur teacher about it after class or something, and ask some questions; right now im not able to come up with some good questions, but it sounds like ur teacher means good. but those corrupt countries have deceptive names does there government really act like a “democratic republic”? but anyways a point is, being a “democratic republic” shouldn’t effect the countries decision on which economic system they use. i would look around at counties with names like that and see what system of government and economical system they use.</p>

<p>usually means* would have fit better there. Sorry about that. It’s just what I had been taught. In school we’re currently doing the Vietnam War. My teacher told us that any country by the name of “Democratic Republic” meant communist, hence the “Democratic Republic of North Vietnam”. Is it not that way any more? Or, which is more likely, is my teacher wrong?</p>
