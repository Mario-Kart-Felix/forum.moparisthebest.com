<p>Obama is doing a fine job…Sure, we get in more debt, but we will eventually make money off it due to interest, in another 20 years.</p>
<p>Plus, I think we can’t trust another republican, in these recent years, they have been fucking up badly.</p>

<p>His spent money is turning into more dept, its not going to come back. Nothing has worked since the beginning, not even cash for clunkers. The government FAILED to repay the companies within the promised 10 day wait, so companies started quitting they’re part in program. Also trying to do something like that to save the enviroment is like spitting in the ocean, barely any effect if any. Volcanoes do more damage than humans will do in 100 years, so if global warming is real, its inevitable.</p>
<p>You say they ‘fuck up’, How have they done that? Don’t give me shit oil bush crap, a real excuse.</p>

</aside>
<p>So you’re saying we should sit by and let global warming occur? I’m 100% that reducing emissions will have more effects than spitting in the ocean. It may not be a huge effect, but it’s better than nothing.</p>

<p>Its a natural cycle that scams like Al Gore are trying to make money off of.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Its not a scam…Its true. More greenhouse gases = warmer earth.</p>
<p>Warmer earth = polar ice caps melt, and our water levels rise. also: the earth gets hotter, causing major droughts in areas, and can lead up to forest fires…</p>
<p>not really a scam, more like common sense.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes its happening, But its not because of humans. Its a natural cycle and they’re using it to scam money like it will make a difference.<br>

What proof do you have of this… because like I said, [quote author=cooper link=topic=382801.msg2943071#msg2943071 date=1252024503]<br>
no major scientific bodies reject human influence on climate change<br>

Us polluting has an effect, barely if any.</p>
<p>[quote=“yakman, post:79, topic:289602”]you climate change deniers are just another conspiracy theory.<br>
you expect us to believe that the entire scientific establishment is lying to us.</p>
<p>fuck off[/quote]<br>
The climate is changing, but its from a natural cycle that the earth goes through. We’re coming out of an ice age… That’s what i mean by a scam, people are using it as an excuse to raise money to help/fix an inevitable event/cycle.</p>

<blockquote>QUESTION: Scientists disagree. We don't know the science well enough yet, so why should we do anything?
ANSWER: Actually, there is strong scientific consensus on the reality of human-caused climate change. See the consensus/position statements of: - National Academy of Sciences - Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - American Geophysical Union (AGU) - American Meteorological Society (AMS) - American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Oreskes (Science, 2004) analyzed all abstracts in refereed scientific publications from 1993-2003 with the keywords "global climate change" (928 papers). None disagreed with the consensus position that human activities are causing the current warming.</blockquote>

QUESTION: Scientists disagree. We don’t know the science well enough yet, so why should we do anything?<br>
ANSWER: Actually, there is strong scientific consensus on the reality of human-caused climate change. See the consensus/position statements of: - National Academy of Sciences - Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - American Geophysical Union (AGU) - American Meteorological Society (AMS) - American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Oreskes (Science, 2004) analyzed all abstracts in refereed scientific publications from 1993-2003 with the keywords “global climate change” (928 papers). None disagreed with the consensus position that human activities are causing the current warming.<br>
[/quote][/quote]<br>
Still, there’s no since in attempting to solve it, many big businesses and oil companies care about money more than the environment. And like i said, volcanoes do more damage than we do in 100 years in 1 eruption.</p>
<p>Honestly im not a global warming expert, but i do believe its a bunch of shit. Fossil fuels are burned naturally everyday so when we decide to burn them to power vehicles etc its a problem?</p>
<p>The recent ‘jump’ in warming can also be linked to MT ST Helens eruption in 2006: <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,237578,00.html">http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,237578,00.html</a> and <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6635776/">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6635776/</a></p>
<blockquote>[b][size=12pt]They also release carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas that's primarily blamed for global warming.  Mount St. Helens produces between 500 and 1,000 tons a day of carbon dioxide, Gerlach estimates.[/size][/b]</blockquote>
<p>Every year the arctic ice pack breaks up, why no change in sea level? Frozen ice displaces the same amount of water as melted ice, if not less. Ice expands when frozen.</p>

<p>Heyyy what do ya know!! between 1960-2000 there were 4 major eruptions!</p>
<p>We also haven’t been able to trace warming like we can now, so there’s your jump.</p>

<blockquote>Just Use Logic
<p>Do you believe in Man-Made Global warming? Well, you shouldn’t!</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>You don’t need a huge think-tank to see through the propaganda.  Here’s how to figure out the truth for yourself:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Have you looked at your own outside thermometer? Record lows and snow storms abound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seventh grade physics shows that CO2’s molecular weight makes it very heavy. It can’t rise high enough to cause the greenhouse effect.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, there is a greenhouse effect, but it’s mostly caused by water vapor! H2O is much lighter than CO2.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>College freshman statistics will show you that the error rate in temperature samples used is greater than the claimed temperature rise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Glaciers in Greenland have recently been shown to be getting thcker, not thinner. Same with antarctic ice, which is never mentioned by warming alarmists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stories of polar bears declining are lies, according to our government’s own figures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CO2 is plant food! When the earth was young, there was very little free oxygen. It was poisonous to the few life forms here (primitive bacteria and plants). It increased to today’s levels partly as exhaust from plants and partly from a few comets “visiting.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clearing of forests happens only where governments own the forest. Private ownership of forests results in cyclical growing and cutting. They don’t waste the economic value of their own land! Take a look at the huge forests in Georgia and Florida, owned by Weyerhauser &amp; other lumber companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sunspot activity is in a cycle in which it reduces warming radiation from the sun. This is actually causing a cooling cycle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about recent record cold temperatures and snow storms?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is it that the big scares always mean big profits for companies connected to governments. E.g. GE owns NBC, which is scaring us. But GE makes big dollars from sales of generators, nuclear, windmills, and solar to governments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who want US to completely change our lives are immune. How about Al Gore making his millions - driving his SUVs, owning several energy inefficient HOMES, plura. He tells us to stop using gas, while he is private-jetting around to give big money speeches?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We’re supposed to forget similar false fears. Many of the same companies made big money off the “ozone layer” scam. Remember that one? It has also proven false. But, the media which scared us about it has remained silent. Instead, they come up with a new scary theory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About 7 years ago, the same government-connected scientists and insiders were trying to scare us with the coming ice age. Remember that?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Volcanoes and the ocean are by FAR larger sources of CO2 and other “greenhouse” gases. Many, many, many multiples of the amounts we exhaust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NASA was actually caught faking “warming” data. They simply copied September temperatures and submitted the same figures for October. They then claimed October was the hottest it’s been in decades.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If “Global Warming” is true, why fudge figures? I am very skeptical when someone - especially a government insider - is trying to scare me and grab my wallet at the same time.</p>
<p>Fear is used to turn off the logical part of your brain. It makes you an easier “mark.”</p>
<p>So, beware of the scare! Don’t believe “officials” just because of their title.</p>
</blockquote><br>
<a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/Global-Warming-Fake-01" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://hubpages.com/hub/Global-Warming-Fake-01</a>
<p>Seeing as how in the end Co2 has no effect on the ozone layer, then this so called “ozone hole” would actually cool the earth by releasing the ‘greenhouse gases’. SO THE SOLUTION WOULD BE TO DO NOTHING! Think of nature as you would your body, when you have too much food in your body, you throw up. If the earth has too much co2 in the air, it would have its own way to get rid of it.</p>
<p>We then go back into the original fact, that its a natural cycle. Recent sun activity has not only effect the ice caps on earth, but on mars also: <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2003/07aug_southpole.htm">http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2003/07aug_southpole.htm</a></p>
<p>What does this say? Its a natural cycle that we have no control over. Something this complex is managed by nature and nature has its ways of controlling and sustaining itself. The ocean absorbs most of the co2 anyway… That means all the underwater plants are turning it into oxygen and re-releasing it into the ocean for fish. So think of all the underwater plants on the ocean floor, the ocean takes up 70% of the earth. That’s ALOT of water sitting on a HUGE sea floor with SUPERFAGINCRAFRIGILLIONs of plants all absorbing MASSIVE amounts of co2.</p>
<p>Yakman, for someone so excellent at proving the non existence of god, i was almost sure you would have already knew it was a lie. They’re doing exactly what they did with Christianity:</p>
<p>Make you feel guilty (Adam sinned/ you drive a car and pollute)<br>
Scare you (Hell/ Heating of the earth and floods from ice caps)<br>
Make you give back (Church/ Give your money to Al Gore and buy new cars etc)</p>
<p>To many people are falling for this, it is a complete lie for universities to convince the government that its a threat to humanity so the government can whip out money for them to research it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">We couldn’t make the earth warmer than we wanted to, so how would we make it colder.</span></p>

<p>Greenhouse gases are natural gases…They have been there since the start of the Earth. But true, cars contribute but you’re wrong about greenhouse gases being caused by it. It’s been proven that without the greenhouse effect(which is also natural - we’re just merely speeding it up) the Earth would not exist.</p>

Im for getting off of oil. I always hate that feeling that you need something else, like when you buy a paintball gun you’re not done buying. You’re going to need paintballs and what if the store has none left. For a car you need oil. Bad example i guess but yea.</p>

Yes but we are digging up oil from underground that hasn’t been touched in millions of years and burning it into the atmosphere, but like i said, you guys aren’t thinking of how powerful nature is. It has its own process for things like this.</p>
<p>You guys need to also think of what could happen if we stopped all the cars and factories that give off GH gases. The earth may have already adapted to having this much in the atmosphere and as soon as its gone catastrophic things could happen.</p>
